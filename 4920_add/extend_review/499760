If you took these exact mechanics and made a spiderman game with having web instead of a hook, and a large city with baddies to punch, I'd give you 100 bucks. Seriously guys, most unique mechanics i've seen in a Vive game. And I play alot lol I love the vive. The trailer for this does no justice. It should start the trailer off showing you can climb 1000 feet into the air and skydive and pretty much fly. along with hulk like jumping abilities and more than one character with bonus levels. WAYYYYY underated game. 100/10 MAKE A SPIDER MAN GAME. CALL MARVEL!"

You locomote (in various ways, always a plus) around a crimson forest. You do this in a very peaceful way, with tidbits of narration, until you get to grandma's house.At which point she tasks you with knitting a quilt made from your own epidermis!"

I hate teleporting (although it lets you use this option if you want to) and directional pad locomotion(this is the worst). Anyway, at first i was kinda saddened by the low polgon count of the scenery but once you get out of the beginning area it gets much better and you realize this is probably a compromise because everything is open world. The art direction is nice and I love the voiceover. I still havent beaten the game but so far its really fun, I feel like I am really walking/climbing through some dilapidated forest to find grandma's house. for $4 bucks this is a no brainer, definitely get it. This is the kind of game I hope more devs will make."

The reason is because this is one of the few vive games that has actually completely immersed me inside of another world, one that I am very fond of. There are very few vive games that focus more on atmosphere and exploring a large and beautiful world rather than throwing hundreds of enemies at you or focusing on high speed gameplay. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of exploration and atmosphere in fairytail type experiences."

If you are a fan of the Little Red Riding Hood story, or want to try out a range of VR locomotion methods, buying this game is a no-brainer.The game is fairly straightforward, but that is a good thing. This allows you to experiment with the great number of locomotion methods to reach the end in your own pacing. Traditional teleportation is an option, as are swinging your arms to move, free climbing on any surface, jumping, floating, and using a hookshot. I personally found the arm-swinging method to be my favorite, as I could use it while walking in place to slowly meander through the forest in the manner I would were I actually walking through a forest. This game is a immersive as you want it to be.Combat is a bit frantic, but not unsatisfying. I definitely felt unsettled at certain parts of the game, which is proof enough to me that the atmosphere was exactly what it needed to be. With the developer providing frequent updates, I'd say hop on board for this one; you won't regret it."

,Recommended,499760,25083290,"Posted: 22 August, 2016",all,ForceKin,"Very cool little game. It has platforming, collecting, and some combat. The visuals are alright for what they are, a little barebones but workable and they create a pleasant atmosphere. My only issues are minor ones, such as there not being better ambient sound and fall damage not being a thing, despite the game providing you with a mean of avoiding it. It makes the mechanic pointless. Other than that, it has some cool systems like arm-swinger locomotion and climbing/grappling. Definitely worth a pick up for the price."

,Not Recommended,499760,25339351,"Posted: 3 September, 2016",all,Vulcan,"Ok, so I know this game is getting lots of positive reviews.  Sadly I just can't give one of them. It's the story of little red riding hood told from the perspective of hood and the huntsman.  The game has really horrid graphics, it's hard to tell ground from rocks.  The voice acting is super amateur, and the overall fighting mechanics are oversimplified.  Additionally it's unrealistically short.  Sure it's a cheap game, but with what it has to offer it shoudld be among the freebie titles.Pros:The walking mechanic is actually really nice.Cons:The huntsmans grapple hook launches you through the air...and walls...and mountains...it pretty much clips you through the level even when not trying.The story is really, really, really dull.Short.Enemies die super easy.Ending sucks.2/10 (Bonus point for the really good game mechanics)  Asked for a refund."

The world is really well put together and the locomotion is the best I've seen yet.The umbrella to slow fall is a cool mechanic and I like that you can literally climb everything (and you can fly if you are up for an arm workout) Throwing axes with the hunstman felt good and the voiceacting was suprisingly solid. This is one of the most promising vive games/styles I've seen yet. The story and environment were very immersive and the concept is great...the first world I really felt like I could explore in vr. Props to the dev on this one and if you're reading you should hands down pick this up. Beyond recommended.

,Not Recommended,499760,26268691,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,RED-FROG,"If it was a free game, the experience would have been ok.Graphics, sound and overall game concept is horrible.Why have walk locomotion (which is cool), unlimited teleportation AND grappling hook all at once?Collecting apples, killing enemies, exploring (if that's even possible in this low-res texture mess) ... nothing makes sense here. You don't have to do any of these things.ALL you have to do is to walk/teleport/grapple from Point A and move into a trigger volume B to end the game! Nothing stops you.A walking (teleporting) simulator, an extremely ugly one.I'd love to see a good speedrun of this. The game should be manageable within 20 seconds or less in a perfect ""run"" on both characters and I am not lying."
,Recommended,499760,28172058,"Posted: 3 December, 2016",all,Game Cooker US Rocks VR,"My wife played the game and got sick so maybe the running in place is not for everyone. She could not figure out the teleporting. She was using the slingshot and figured out the climbing aspect so for noobs it should be an easy game to figure out. The graphics are not great but I didn't mind the artistic value of them for the riding hood theme. For the price the game is worth trying for something different and to show off to new users as long as you know they are not VR sickness prone or if you know they have their VR legs. The developer should build on this idea and either add some decent content to this game or make a new one that makes good use of the slingshot, climbing, and running with more realistic graphics. As I was watching my wife play I was thinking rock climbing in scenic areas, lara croft, indiana jones, other exploration type games,etc. It isn't a AAA title but not as bad as some made it out to be. I am not so critical as others. Plus I know this game is old now for VR so I am rating it as such taking that into account. It just took me this long to play it.Video below in faster speed to show how my wife did. Yes I wrote Redswood wrong in the video. Oh well. ;-)https://youtu.be/etPeNUB9CrM"

76561198333387235,Recommended,499760,27710957,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,KITTY,"Excellent Short Game!!  Big shout out to the developer(s) of Redswood VR for being the first to expose me to walking by jogging my arms and then BY GRAPPLING HOOK!!!  THAT WAS SO BADA$$ and surprising!!!  This short-story game is a good one for those in your life who don't want something too scary, but still has suspense and exploring and collecting things.  Again it's simple, but this is a good one to introduce to your non-traditional gamers (like myself) bc it's not too difficult and you can kill the enemies fairly easily.  You'll likely run into a couple small glitches like there were a few times I couldn't grab the slingshot rock and I had to keep teleporting away from the rat-things and keep trying my slingshot until the rock got into the right spot and some crazy things with the physics in the house - like i dropped a book on the floor and when I tried to pick it up, I picked up the whole house over and over.  But other than that, I truly loved the experience it gave me and I'm having everyone in my family and my friends try it.  Well done, Dev!  :D"

I hope the developer continues to work on this to further improve (and find more applications for) the multiple game mechanics he came up for this title."
76561198379725588,Not Recommended,499760,33414143,Posted: 9 July,all,keru_74,In the current state I cann't recommend this game as there are too many glitches and climbing experience is awful. Object collisions ruin this game for me. Although I like the Idea of the game these things need to be fixed.
