,Recommended,499890,31162996,Posted: 15 April,all,Line,"A must-play for the rhythm game fan.tl;drgreat wub wub soundtrack, fight a giant sand worm, tight controls, fun gameplay, fight a giant robot spider, worth buyingTrace ribbons of light with one stick, and shoot enemies with the other - all to the beat of an outstanding soundtrack - Aaero is an intensely exciting experience that is both accessible and has more than a bit of challenge to the dedicated player.At the time of writing, I'm one of 5 people to have accessed and completed all difficulties in the game, having taken me 8 hours to achieve this.While the limited amount of people to reach this stage demonstrates the difficulty involved in the game, it also highlights a lack of content; while what is in the game is intensely fun, there isn't a lot of it, and it can be completed in a few sittings.This is not to say the game is easy at all - Aaero is, indeed, a rhythm game at heart - to beat higher difficulties, a lot of perseverance is required to master the nuances of each song.However, the difficulty change between the levels - Normal, Advanced, and Master - are minimal, only adding a few more enemies and hazards to the level. I'm not sure if there actually was a difficulty change between Advanced and Master, other than only having 1 life in the latter, but to achieve a competitive score at the Advanced level, it is necessary to stay alive the whole time anyway.As a rhythm game, one of the most important aspects are the controls, and Aaero really shines in this department. Controls are tight and responsive, and easy to learn. When something goes wrong, you know that it's your fault, and this helps make sure that failing to complete a level or achieve a certain score feels like your own fault, and not one inherent to the game.The soundtrack chosen for the game is excellent - a fine selection of music in the vein of dubstep, electronic, drum and bass etc. Following the ribbons of light will add layers to the music, and every sound effect in the game - target locking beeps, weapon impacts, enemy spawns and so on - is quantised to the beat of the rhythm, achieving a state where the game is as much a part of the music as the music is the game.The shooting aspect is simple enough to understand, and has a little more depth to it than first seems. Attacks will always land on the 1st or 3rd beats of every 4/4 bar, and you are rewarded for hitting these exactly on time - in attack efficiency, as well as score. Understanding this mechanic is crucial, but skipped over in the game's tutorial, which can lead to some amount of frustration when your shots seem inconsistent.When these two main mechanics are combined, Aaero comes to life as a fantastic rhythm rail shooter in the long-empty void of Rez. A lack of content will disappoint the most dedicated and skilled players, but in spite of that, Aaero is not an experience to be missed."

,Recommended,499890,31187219,Posted: 16 April,all,MxMark™,I highly recommend this game for anyone that likes fast phased  rhythm games. The controls are awesome. The graphics look great. And the music is amazing. It brings me back to the break through of good and amazing dubstep partys. The whole package just ailings with each other. It's tens and makes you feel good.
,Recommended,499890,31084389,Posted: 11 April,all,Acey Winters,"Aaero is amazing. If you have had the pleasure of playing REZ, then just imagine that but with a bit of a twist on it. The game REQUIRES a controller to play so have your Xbox/PS4/Whatever has two analog sticks ready. You'll be chasing ribbons of light to keep the music flowing, dodging incoming objects, and shooting baddies to the beat of the electronic soundtrack consisting of artists such as Noisia, Flux Pavilion, Neosignal, and many others! I can't wait to see what tracks might be added in the future!"
,Recommended,499890,31168813,Posted: 15 April,all,Eindigen,"Aaero is a beautiful hybrid of a rhythm game and on-rails shooting that shines brightest in its 3 boss battles.== VISUALSHeavily inspired from  the early rhythm game days of FreQuency, Amplitude, and REZ, the low-polygon models look stunning in HD, especially when coupled with the particle effects. Color plays a large part in the portrayal of their environments and reinforces the digital playground you navigate through. EDM fans will feel right at home as this visual style is often used in music videos for Drum & Bass, Dubstep, Future Funk, etc.The levels seem to ""breathe"" with the music, which is great feedback and a trip to play while high.== AUDIOThe licensed soundtrack of Noisia, Flux Pavillion, Habstrakt & Megalodon, and more is one of the reasons this game was so successful. While it is still possible to have a great rhythm game without the licensing (a-la FreQuency), it really helps when selling the game to a skeptical audience.The audio mastering was very well done in this game and is slightly different than the official track releases by the artists, giving each song a fresh feel that worked for each of the game's levels (even if you've heard these songs before).== MECHANICSJust like the visuals, the mechanics feel like an homage to early rhythm games with a fresh spin on their execution. The controls are tight but forgiving, so players who aren't accustomed to rhythm games won't be instantly turned off to it. The game can sometimes feel like a brain-teaser, having to move the controller's analog sticks clockwise and counter-clockwise (and at the same time), but in a way that encourages practice and mastery rather than frustration.All of the games actions are performed on beat to the song, whether or not you perform them on the beat yourself. This all helps the player stay on beat or find the beat if they tend to lose their way while enhancing the player's engagement.== SCORINGThe game's scoring system is a nice blend of intense but non-intrusive, allowing players who don't care about scoring big to complete the levels without worrying about how well they're doing. For those looking to climb the leaderboards, however, the game does a great job of providing depth by rewarding precision movement and timing. If none of this really interests you, there's always ""Chillout"" mode, which forgoes the scoring altogether. There's definitely something here for everyone.== BOSS BATTLESAmazing. Brilliantly crafted. The boss battles are where Aaero really shows how innovative it is. The bosses movements and attacks are all timed with the music, and even the levels themselves fit in perfectly with how the boss is tackled. If Shadow of the Colossus was a music game, this is how it would be done.My only gripe with the game is that the entirety of the game wasn't just a collection of boss battles past the first boss. The way the music really ties into the feel of the boss designs was also a great feeling, and made defeating the bosses that much more satisfying.== CRITICISMSThe first criticism I have with the game is that the difficulty progression doesn't always flow nicely, especially when you have to beat the songs in order. The song, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" was the biggest culprit of this, where the mechanics felt like the song should have been placed down further into the game.The screen size scaling was also an issue (at least for me). Running on a 21:9 monitor, I scaled the game size to 100% (the default is 80%, and it made some parts of the game almost unplayable at times as the enemies and projectiles I was trying to destroy were often outside of the shooting range. From videos I've seen of other people playing, this didn't seem to be a problem, so I'm assuming it wasn't a ""feature"" but a bug, though I can't be sure. Either way, it was frustrating.The music ribbon (the line you have your ship follow to the beat) patterns were also fairly basic. This is fine on normal mode, as the entire Normal playthrough seemed like a tutorial run, but these basic patterns also continued into Advanced mode as well, meaning the difficulty curve didn't stretch too far.== FINAL THOUGHTSSome people will criticize this game for not being ""strictly"" a rhyhtm game and including a shooting aspect, but I feel as though they are ignoring the fact that the combat is directly tied to the music and rhythm as well. As I said before, every detail of this game is tied to rhythm, it just might not be apparent at first. The combination of the shooting and timing your movements might just be the gateway for people to see the draw to rhythm games in the future.Highly recommended."

,Recommended,499890,31129710,Posted: 13 April,all,b34ny,"Having a great time so far!  I'm 82% complete and about to unlock the next difficulty, can't stop trying to perfect the levels.  It reminds me a lot of Rez but without as much frantic shooting, the grinding the rail aspect of the game with it's musicality is a great hook.I wish there was more vocal tracks thrown in to the mix, maybe later.  I was dreaming of an ABGT collaboration with this game."
,Recommended,499890,31666036,Posted: 10 May,all,Synthbent715,"I'm a sucker for rhythm games and this one is really fun.  Personally I'm not a huge fan of dubstep but it works perfectly for this type of game.  I could do without some of the shooting sections, some of them feel quite cheap and can really mess up that ""in the zone"" feel you start to get after you pull off some sweet multipliers.  Some of the shooting sections are great and actually ADD to the overall vibe, there are just a few that are out of place and annoying.  The ""follow the line"" mechanic of the rest of the game is pretty awesome, nice feedback on the controller too, really gives you a sense of impact as you hit it just right.  Most of the stages are really fun, but there are a couple that are a bit boring, I think it has a lot to do with preference though.  Really hoping for new stages to be added, I'd gladly pay a few bucks for some DLC, the game was pretty cheap as it was.  I've spent a few hours trying to beat my high scores and its pretty addictive."

Collected all 225 stars in roughly six hours. My recommendation is wait for it to go on sale, since it took only that long to 100% the game (minus finding all of the secrets), but still a fun game for any rythmn lover. Replayability is dependant on the player, if you're a big fan of leaderboards than you'll enjoy beating your own scores. Otherwise a single run will probably be all you play."

,Recommended,499890,33202461,Posted: 3 July,all,TrojanThighs,Early on in my aaero path but I have to say i am enjoying the hell out fo it so far!Whilst I can kid of understand the complaints about the shooting elements I don't agree. I think this helkps to push your awareness and skill witht he ribbon sections and breaks these upo a bit. I think there would be more complaints about monotony and not wnough variation without the enemies.The devs seem quite active in the community hub which is nice to see and the fact that they really do seem to be responding is great! Like all Music rhythm action games if you don't like the soundtrack get out of the kitchen (?!) at the moment its a lot of the wubz but if they really are thinking of exploring DLC then I can see the growth potential of using other genrtes (I REALLY think some decent classical songs would work in this style - and I cannot imagine a genre that would define that chillout mode which aaero has than that).I'd definitely give this a crack if you're a rhythm game adict like I am but I can also see this appealing to twin stick shooter fans after something a bit different (it definitely uses both sticks!) or on rails shooter afficianados. Whilst it'd be worthwhile checking out some videos to see if it might appeal I'd definitely use this as an aw3esome case for testing the refund policy as an hour in and I know I've spent my money wisely.
,Recommended,499890,33770676,Posted: 24 July,all,Hyphon,"I heard about Aaero in a German podcast called ""Insert Moin"" (Danke für diesen Tipp).It sounds interesting, so I searched for gameplay on YouTube and my curiosity was at max.I bought it on Steam and actually I don't regret any cent.15 licensed songs from artists like Noisia and Neosignal. Awesome graphics and a nice gameplay which is between musicgames like Audiosurf and Twin-Stick-Shooter.I can't believe that only two people made this, but I love this game.As one might say, 15 tracks are not that much and the game will be boring fast. I played the tracks everal times now and there's no end.Also the community support is awesome. They asked for ideas for new songs and answer to almost every question.Thumps up Mad Fellows! I can't wait for your next game or maybe a new set of levels for Aaero!"
,Not Recommended,499890,31083972,Posted: 11 April,all,Power Brick,"After trying this at EGX in 2015 I have been eagerly waiting the last year and a half for this game and boy.... was I let down.In 2015 Aaero was void of any shooting, and that was great, it was focused on rhythm and served a great purpose of being a rhythm game, that was genuinely fun and that's what made me fall in love with the game.In 2016 when I played it again at EGX there was shooting, it was awkward and took me out of the fun fluidity of the rhythm game I had been hyped about for the last year, I brushed this off as being an alpha build of the game and it would be sorted by the full release.I was wrong, Aaero did not feel fluid, the shooting totally ruins the experience for me, I wanted the rhythm game I played in 2015 and what I got was if Audiosurf and Call of Duty had an awkward love child. The problematic aiming from the right analogue stick while trying to line up on the track is unnecessarily difficult and really ruins the experience for me.Sorry Mad Fellow, you did well in 2015 but you added a feature that wasn't needed and ruined the game.EDIT: Thanks to the devs for responding, it's a nice change to find a dev that cares! I was using a Steam Controller which also made the shooting feel awful because of the trackpad and not really being able to smoothly glide over the enemies, after trying it with an Xbox 360 controller it feels more fluid, it does still take the player out of the action a bit but not as bad as with a Steam Controller."
,Recommended,499890,31139265,Posted: 14 April,all,ECHOR.,Aaero is a similar game to Rez Infinite on PSVR which I have played. I do not think at this stage it is as good as Rez but it has potential. There is something about Rez which is cool and just generally better. Also Thumper is a better Rythem game than this. It still does a good job but didn't decide to keep it due to it being not as good. But Rythem games are good in general so you might want to get it as it is the cheapest of the three!

For some really stupid reason, it's default assignment is action0,1,2,3(I don't know what that means), so I had to change it to button0,1,2,3...And right stick doesn't work.My gamepad isn't that special. Left stick was mapped to X/Y axis and right stick is Z axis/roll. Why doesn't it work?EDIT:I'm using ""Hori Pad 4 FPS"" which is a PS3/PS4 compatible USB gamepad.Either PS3 or PS4 mode doesn't work. Registering gamepad to steam slightly changes the behavior of the game to the worse. It makes the left stick not working too.Reassigning the gamepad is currently almost impossible. I got a bunch of meaningless names such as action1, 2, 3(all of them doesn't work) or a few dozens of analog inputs which I don't know which is the correct right stick to which direction."

Aaero has 15 songs to play through. replay is dependent on the improvement of your scores or the love for the bass cannon. If you are a die hard Rez player you should pick this up for the nostalgia factor and a twist in game play.Aaero requires a controller to play!have a controller of your choice that has twin analog sticks. Someone in the discussion threads has adapted the steam controler if you have it.
