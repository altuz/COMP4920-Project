76561197973806021,Recommended,500190,24277412,"Posted: 12 July, 2016",all,[___/]TC,"Not the successor to Close Combat but a good filler whilst we wait for it.  It's just come out of Greenlight but I hope the development hasn't finished as with a little bit of polish this could be very good.  The following is only based on a few short battles so hope to find even more good points in the next few days....ProsEasy to get intoQuick to start up a battleSimple to mechanics to convey ordersSome nice maps (nine currently and each map supports eight missions - 3/4 from Germany and the rest from GB, USA or France.  The maps also feature contour lines when you scroll out to give you an idea of cover and lines of fire etc.Seems to be a good mix of units already in the couple of battles I've played.ConsFeedback can be poor - sometime not clear if enemy squad is defeated or their location even when you are on top of them.Battles end abruptly and lack any stats.  It would be nice to know kills/losses at the end.Map Navigation - it would be a ""nice to have"" if moving your mouse to the edge of map then moved the map aroundSave mechanics - wasn't sure if it had a save system but does remember where you left each battle if you exited correctly.  A short note in the instuctions may help others.Escape button - the closes game down and doesn't open the menu as I thought it might.OverallFor the price this is a good entry level WW2 stategy game and with a few improvements it will be a very good one.  Add a campaign or editor and it could even be an excellant one."

Alot of ww2 have very good graphics but for some reason they don't draw me into tactically like older games do. Birds eye veiw WW2 games work. Not sure why they just do.The original has literaly endless missions as it uses radnomly generated maps so you can start as  British  or Japanese officer in the late 1930's and play 500 plus missons before you reach the end of the War in 45. It's huge and never gets boring.I remember playing it with my grandad who fought in north Africa and despite him having bad memories of the war he enjoyed it.This game only has nine maps which is very limited, the sound effects are too repetative with guys shouting medic all the time. This is annoying. The control of the game isnt as fluid as the original I find it either. There just isn't as much detail and not as much time has been taken going into the details of the game in my opinion.I was hoping for a carbon copy of the original Firefight with updated graphics sadly the game is scaled down and their isn't the attention to depth there was in the older game.However it's still good fun and I know Sean works largley alone so this game is still an achievement.I hope he updates this game and makes it bigger with maybe a narrative storyline to take you through the war as an officer in each nation rather than the random missons this offers.I have to say the original version of Firefight is still far superior to this and if you like this game then google Sean O'Connors windows games to get the older better version.In summary a good game but if you want a real Firefight experience and hundreds of hours or birds eye view WW2 carnage. BUY THE ORIGINAL.Well done though Sean please keep working on this game and make this bigger and more epic like the first game."
,Recommended,500190,31851595,Posted: 19 May,all,The Zygomorphic Glop of Cake,"Look, I love this game. I loved the first one. I love this one. I know it's not perfect. It has (a good deal of) flaws. But the @#$%s complaining about it are starting to get on my nerves. Some idiot spent 66 hours on it to say I don't like, and give you details why. Why did you play it for 66 bleeding hours? Seems to me that getting 66 hours off of a ten dollar game is a pretty good deal. And don't tell me you didn't enjoy, it was 66 hours. Further, this applies to the idiots with over 2 hours. You know what? Steam has a thing, that's called a refund system. If it took you over 2 hours to figure out all the flaws of this game, then you, are an idiot. Geez. 14 days and 2 hours seems enough for anyone. I'm not saying this game is that good. I'll play it sometimes, but it's not my first choice. Just the people who play it just to complain... Geez..."

(72 across 9 maps)Beautiful Handmade maps""New"" Kind of stratedgy.Cons:Infantry Graphcis are small and look alike.If you replay a mission the enemy will be in the same spot.No SkirmishNo MultiplayerNo Manual/TutorialI have to say I enjoy it a lot! It is simple but fun. I have played many wargames like Close Combat (II,III,COI,GTC,LD and more), Men of War, Theatre of War and more. The game has a neat feature during combat where it tells you where your units where hit and by what kinda like a text adventure. Its a cheap game but it is an iOS port. He has promised to improve the game in a varitety of ways (one being multiplayer) and hopefully he will stick to his promise. A good easy to learn game."
76561198022611199,Recommended,500190,25233035,"Posted: 29 August, 2016",all,caphillrat,"I recommend Firefight to anyone considering it.  It is a good game at even better price point.Here also are Five Suggestions For Firefight:1.	 Levels of difficulty: I have my hands full with the game’s AI right now, but it would be great to have a higher level of difficulty.2.	A way to access your OOB for a particular scenario.  For one scenario, I didn’t know I had armor coming until they showed up.3.	Multiplayer – As the Dad of two young kids, I don’t have much time to game online so I tend to gravitate towards titles with a low barrier to starting.  Firefight is the perfect fit right now for tactical gaming.  It would definitely have a longer shelf life for me if it had multiplayer.4.	A scenario editor or better yet a comprehensive map editor.  The ability to create scenarios would take some pressure off the game’s designer and would allow him to devote more time towards improving the gameplay.5.	A simple manual.  I think adding a manual to the Steam page would increase sales. I know this is one of the first things I look at when I am considering purchasing a game.Thanks Sean for putting so much into your game already.  I hope it continues to grow.Chrishttp://thesharpendgaming.blogspot.com/2016/08/five-suggestions-for-firefight.html"
76561197997100736,Recommended,500190,24324088,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,!HoNose,"TL;DR: Recommended for people who want to scratch a quick, fairly realistic tactical RTS itch. Easy to learn and pick up.Although it is a very bare-bones game, with no campaign, dynamic or otherwise, custom battles, tutorial (aside from a slightly hidden help-me that can only be accessed in-game during a mission) or even an options menu (it would be nice to have volume control, if nothing else), Firefight is still a very satisfying tactical RTS.Control infantry, tanks and artillery on a large map, inching forward before making contact. Fix the enemy with suppressive fire and attack from the flank. Watch your men get butchered on an open field because you ignored step one and two. Even though it's a slow and methodical game, it can be very stressful and fun clearing out treelines and industrial areas, leapfrogging infantry sections from one building to the next while other squads and tanks cover them. Though there are no campaigns, the - in my opinion - sufficient selection of maps and missions make for fun 30-60 minute challenges each for those who don't want to make huge time and emotional investments.Apart from the limited features, which understandably could be a turn-off for many people, the only gameplay complaints I have are tanks' pathfinding, often moving far away from where they were ordered without obvious explanation, and the inability to make them target an area I know an enemy to be coming from. When tanks are your only anti-tank weapon, it can be really annoying to be forced to toss a coin and hope you shoot first.Finally, I don't recommend games based on features that may be added, but this game is effectively a rewrite of an older game by the same name and developer. This gives me reason to believe that this game may be expanded with more features like campaigns and other fronts."
,Recommended,500190,29128045,Posted: 8 January,all,VoidWhisper,Bought this on a whim because close combat isnt on sale and this is close combat inspired.I love it. Its so damn simple that i was frustrated at first for not being wble to use arrow keys.Everything is done by your mouse and the Ai. Which may sound scary but trust in your soldiers to keep themselves alive besides the usual misadventure and bad luck of a ricochet or shrapnel from a mortar hitting the Lt in the leg.Its small but has alot of missions to keep you playing. Replay is a little null right now unless you're a perfectonist or your luck was so bad half your force was killed by one artillery strike. And you want to retry. Give it time and support and this could be even more amazing that what ive seen so far
,Not Recommended,500190,24378637,"Posted: 17 July, 2016",all,rkmase,"Not ready yet. There are basically two options for each unit. Move, and fire. There is little feedback, and no sort of tutorial or help system at all. No LOS tools, graphic options, or unit info besides dead or wounded (although there are heartrate monitors, which I assume contribute to panic or chance to rout, but no indication that's true). No weapons info, range, power, effectiveness, etc. For some reason FPS also struggles on my 980Ti."

I have a platoon  of infantry fireing arcoss a clearing waiting for artilery to sight in. The right flank runs out of ammo, runs from tree to tree to join up with a friendly squad, gets ammo, gives most of the spare shots the MG and then the squad starts firing again - all without my orders."
,Recommended,500190,25703744,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,zetarho62,"I read the reviews and was worried about the negative reviews but in the end I bought it anyway; can't go too wrong for $10.  There are things that could be improved on such as having some type of manual or instructions (they are available after you start a battle, which is too late IMO), a dedicated pause button (you can exit and then come back, but it's an unnecessary step), a tutorial just to get accustomed to the various controls.  I didn't realize until half way through a battle that I could adjust the frontage of an infantry unit by ""squeezing"" the blue bar inward or outward.Overall, though, I enjoyed the gameplay.  I liked the more real spotting rounds of the artillery before a full fire for effect started.  The graphics are a lot like Close Combat but it's about $20 cheaper and really, for $10 (as of this date), you really can't go wrong."

I like how when behind cover your infantry stand up to shoot rather than just stay in one position and how the tanks and infantry find the best place to fire at the enemy. I really love this game.

76561198035776696,Not Recommended,500190,33403937,Posted: 9 July,all,slickvibe 2,Save your money. This game only resembles Close Combat but it barely plays like it. The units don't listen well and it's very difficult to place them where you want them. In the mean time they get themselves killed. Very clunky. I've bought quite a few games from steam and this is the first review I've ever written here. This game stinks and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Bad things Troops  all the time will do idiotic things like tanks driving backards toward the enemy or expose week flank armor to enemy . Not  sit still and move away when that have perfect shots .etc etc fun and light but orth 10 bucks
