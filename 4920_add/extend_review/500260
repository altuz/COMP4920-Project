Here's how to fix:Goto: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Ben and Ed - Blood Party.Now launch 'BaEBloodParty-Win32-DebugGame.exe' as ADMINISTRATOR.After that, doubble click 'BaEBloodParty.exe' right above it.Your game should now start with no problems what so ever."

,Recommended,500260,32711846,Posted: 23 June,all,A.R.M.,"If you don't like gore, don't get it.If Ultimate Bloodbath Racing / Genki Bowl LIXXV whilst at times tearing your head off and doing lay-ups is appealing to you, and you want to do that with up to three other players, then get this game.If you want a great forgiving/punishing racing/puzzle game, with crude combat, to play with up to three other people, go for it... it does what it sets out to do quite well and does not take itself seriously.If you finish before other contestants you can switch between those who are still racing and left click... which will randomly throw stuff near/at the person you are spectating... which at times may knock them over. It is also simply a lot of fun just watching other people fail...Don’t forget, you can make your own Bloodbath co-op, PvP arenas, or racing games as well… or just combine them all into one for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.In all seriousness, if you get with a  group of people that know what they are doing and are good at timing, you could have some pretty intense races... especially when it involves running, jumping off a ledge, and throwing your head to a higher ledge... so this is a wacky and zany game that can go from Baby's First BloodBath to getting into the Ultimate Al-Gore-Rhythm: Fury Track & No Force-Field.The only con I have come across is if anyone dies and your typing it auto-enters your text.... thus if you keep typing you can ♥♥♥♥ yourself over... such as if you’re at the goal dancing and you hit enter right after someone dies.Enough with the run-on's... have fun, or don't... just make sure you find people to play with then flick them off or dance with them... or just bow down to the brain slugs, drink a Slurm, and get cut into half a head that can no longer move."

I've been a Ben and Ed fan for longer than a year, and when I wrote my review for the first game, I never thought this day would come. Sluggerfly, you have really outdone yourselfs, and to think this was made by only 3 people!?!? 4? I can't wait for this game to grow and its already really popular. I would say £10 is a really good deal, and whilst it has its glitches, most can be easily fixed. Thank you so much Sluggerfly, supporting you all the way!!!"

No issue with gameplay though.I wouldn't mind if the devs. only added more components to the map builder and maybe some more funny costumes/emotes/noises etc. General polishing."

Impressed that only 3 people developed this game. Awesome work, super fun to play with friends, and looking forward to the future updates!Also a lot of replay value in my opinion; after beating a map, it's worth going back with people to replay and change the rules (i.e. less deaths, shorter time, zero fault runs) or just replay with the same rules and see what happens the next time around due to all the variables of the obstacle courses.****Tip for everyone**** game doesn't support it's own voice chat yet, so party up with your friends in Discord app while playing.Edit: Just adding in some more positivity after messing around with DLC maps. This game is the gift that keeps on giving. Even after beating the included maps from developers, there's a ton of user created ones you can download and play with friends as well. Some are a bit weak, but there's a lot that are really really fun as well. Kudos to the [currently] small community for the effort with creating extra maps to keep the fun going."

76561198298595468,Recommended,500260,33426394,Posted: 10 July,all,Hourless,"Pro's:-Multiplayer is so much fun with friends, you can rage and laugh together or even play with a random and make friends with them-Custom Maps, this makes the game into something a whole lot different pretty much the idea of Super Mario Maker I have played some crazy levels but they are mostly pretty great-Mechanics have improved a little and i'm being kind with a little it can still be verrrryyy tedious at times but it's like learning how to kiss for the first time you will get the hang of it-On the Single Player side you have individual levels, in order to unlock the enxt one you have to beat themCon's:-No real story in Single Player and you can complete all the levels relatively quick-Multiplayer is very much a work in progress, times where u respawn for no reason, there are problems where you sprint and jump and there's lag in between which causes you to fall, moving objects are an issue too. Host has HUGE advantage due to not having too deal with lag.OVERALL: It's a pretty fun game with an endless supply of levels due to the level editor, sure it's still quite buggy and glitchy but the devs are constantly updating the game. This game is a gem."

The thing I don't like is that not very many people play online. If people do play online, the server usually needs a password.

The level editor is a nightmare to use/navigate, and then after your done working on a map for 3+ hours, the save function is awkward. If you don't meet all the requirements to save, it still asks if you're sure you want to save it....then it doesn't save. Hopefully they work on the map editor heavily because it's going to be the #1 thing that keeps the game fun. The base maps can be done in one sitting with some friends."

,Not Recommended,500260,33587847,Posted: 16 July,all,FL4at,"Its just lacks fun with constant lag due to overloaded maps (especially with spike balls). Every time I start the game I have to manually reduce the bloom via console to not be completely blinded by the bright visual most maps have. Many collision problems where you clip through the floor or walls, get hit by a hammer's hitbox although it visually did not hit you, or blades that slice you in half even though you jumped over it.Yes I know this is Early Access. But that is no excuse for anything. The developer thinks ""This is a version of the game that is developed so far that we can release it to the public for money."" I hope there will be major improvements in the next months, or the already low player base will go to zero.Recommendation: buy it in sale. Hurts less."
