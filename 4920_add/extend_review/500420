The sillier the friends, the more fun you'll have hiding in a piece of poo while hiding from a clown."
,Recommended,500420,31568394,Posted: 5 May,all,TheDogsBollocks,"The game is so much fun. It has so much potential and the developers of the game actually play their own game, which is incredible as this is what games need. Speaking with one of the developers the game is run by 2 people, and the quality of the game made by two people is amazing, continously asking us for any bugs we find, any suggestions. They also go through the comments of the game in order to find bugs people are experiencing. Great developers and great game a lot of potential, deserves a lot more recognition than it gets."
,Recommended,500420,32307394,Posted: 9 June,all,Fat Bear,"Friend and I purchased the game... Upon entering the options for creating a game, I find that the ""Start"" option is not functioning correctly. When searching for a game, it continuously says no one in my region is playing. The game looked like it could have been neat but don't give these people money. What a waste of time. Requesting a refund.[Edit 1] I purchased the game again based on the feedback from the developer and I am pleased to say the game functions correctly! It's everything I expected the game to be and more. The only thing I advise upon getting this game is to either have plenty of friends get the game alongside you... Or join the discord server set up for this game. It makes for a much better playing experience! Thanks Taibi7 and Winter Studios! This is a must have."

It's amazing fair and you require new spots all the time.They need money to keep the game going but I hope now when it's on steam they might start doing good :D
,Recommended,500420,28587735,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,Bubbles,"This game is great. Even though I have pretty much no playing time here on steam I have played this game when it was not on steam yet and free. You do need people to play it with otherwise it is no fun, as of right now the game generally needs players, since the servers are pretty empty.The maps, at least the first two ones out of three, are pretty darn awesome (I haven't played the third one yet).This is a bit like the Hide&Seek part of Gary's Mod, but it is better, mostly because it is focused on the Hide&Seek more. Even though it is in Early Access it is definitely playable and a lot of fun."
,Recommended,500420,31620574,Posted: 8 May,all,Serfonz,"Like Prop Hunt but there is a proper full game built around the 'shell' that is Prop Hunt, as a 'Soul' use your abilities to haunt, inhabit and deceive the hunters to hide your way to victory.As the hunter, you have 3 options:A clown, a reaper and a robot.They all have their own set of abilities which actually makes being the Hunter as much fun as being the hider.As the clown you can make props jump around, change inhabited props 'state' from ragdoll -> movement. (If someone inhabited a broom per se, then used the 'ragdoll' to make it fall over. This ability would then make them stand up rigid. You can also make all the props bounce around, combining this with your other skill you can quickly find yourself a brand new soul.The Reaper can go invisible and see the trail left by souls for a short period. So if you hunt down a Soul, then it tries to do a runner and looses you, you can go invisible, follow his trail. Then jump out of the shadows to claim your newest soul.The Robot can create an anti-gravity bubble that will cause all props in its vicinity to slowly rise. Good way to catch souls who are trying to run.. + It looks really awesome. You also have a beacon ability that I -think- detects souls within x radius. Need to try this one more to find out!Just needs a bigger playerbase.Highly recommend."

I really hope the game is successful, gets players in and adds the new features"

Very simple and easy to learn/pickup.My friends and I have played this game since the alpha on its original website, spending nights up just fooling around. Glad to see it finally on Steam with a bunch of new features.The seekers each having their own abilities was an awesome feature, and the new possession for souls to fool seekers is a great addition! The maps are great and I can't wait to see what more can come of the items for each seeker/hider.I did a lets play:https://youtu.be/bryHR2WvNy0"

I must say, please nerf the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the reaper, his ♥♥♥♥ing trails are op as fuccckkk. Please nerf it or switch the ability. Also make more maps, and I have no idea how to get the customizations."

I prefer this OVER the orginal prop hunt.Secondly, when playing this game, the developers came on and asked me and my friend about the game and what we think and asked about bugs and glitches and even played with us! They really seem down to earth too!This deserves WAY more reconition! Like WAY more, however I do reccommend in its current state to invite  some friends as right now there are not many players, but I played with only ONE other friend and it was still just as FUN!The price is worth it, the developers are actually sticking to the game, and sure there are a few bugs but thats about it, I totally reccommend!"
,Recommended,500420,32872633,Posted: 27 June,all,TheDreadingDark,"The game is like a standalone version of Prop Hunt in Garry's Mod except every kind of hunter has unique powers and the hiders have ways to mess with the hunters, a lot of fun with friends. I wouldn't buy if you play online by yourself as the game is old and not that many people play it anymore."
,Recommended,500420,29433950,Posted: 22 January,all,𝐃 𝐀 𝐌 𝐍 ᵈᵘᵈᵉ,"Pros:-fun party game with friends.-actually become objects instead of copying them.-haunt ability to trick seekers as to what object you actually are.-good sized maps not too big not too small.Cons: (this is early access so things like bugs, graphic quality and amount of maps are excluded)-abilities can be confusing at times-not enough variety in props-clown seeker abilities are mediocre-reaper seeker invisibility can be overpowered"

,Not Recommended,500420,31667607,Posted: 10 May,all,Qigor,"The game seems cool, but right now you definitely need friends to play it. The servers literally got 0 players online. Probably fun with friends, but can't recommend right now due to no playerbase. I hope it gets more recognition to a point where it becomes possible to actually play."
