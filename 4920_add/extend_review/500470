,Recommended,500470,24441735,"Posted: 21 July, 2016",all,Monsieur Cedric,"Great software!About 25 years ago, I used to render fractals using my x386. I was wishing I could fly in these abstract scenaries, listening to some trippy ambient or techno... Today, it is (almost) happening.I haven't had time to use it much, but I already have few suggestions:- maybe we could play our own playlist?- would be great to have a ""random"" mode...- ...and maybe a ""flight"" mode !Great job, anyway!"

,Recommended,500470,24510559,"Posted: 24 July, 2016",all,Aminom,"Lots of fun and very beautiful to experience. The price is on point. I wish there were more fractals and coloring / lighting options and an ability to zoom in on fine detail. With a bit more work (the ability to use custom formulas, perhaps some way of producing static 360 stereo images to allow for more detail at the expense of being able to move, with a switchable real-time preview) this would easily be worth double the price or more."

It would be nice if the ""Render Region"" used more of the visual space alotted by the vive, the square visual screen makes me feel like im still just looking at a screen.  Cool visuals nonetheless .  Oh and a little less sensitive controls would be nice, you know for those finer tuned details."

,Recommended,500470,24474901,"Posted: 23 July, 2016",all,IronPanda,runs nicely on high spec PC. The FOV is smaller than usual but that's not a huge issue and that ambient music in the background is a brilliant match. Would love some sort of autorun feature but otherwise worth the money.

,Recommended,500470,24443361,"Posted: 21 July, 2016",all,xevious,"It's like the scene in Interstellar where the tesseract is collapsing, except YOU are the one inside watching it move in strange and impossible ways. A very interesting and cool concept. Depth perception is really messed up on small scales (-1<x<1), and the game doesn't make use of the entire field of view, but I'm sure this game will get better and better as it progresses!Some things I would add:-The hand controllers should be visible-The UI should be made easier to work with, especially scaling while moving-Scaling should scale from your head, not your feet-The game should use the entire field of view of the headset"

76561197968255764,Recommended,500470,29832528,Posted: 10 February,all,Importon,This has so much potential.  It really will be an incredible experience once the performance issues are worked out.  If you have a gtx 970 you will not get a smooth frame rate.  I'm looking forward to the new update which supposedly improves the performance.  If it ran smooth I could see myself getting lost in here for hours on a regular basis.  Keep up the good work!  Don't let this one die!
,Recommended,500470,29241539,Posted: 13 January,all,Laboriax,Pretty impressive. Was basically blown away since I have never seen anything like this before. Love the fact that you can see in colour and the scaling ability adds a new dimension. There I was floating through the fractals examining the detail close up. Amazing.  Have only used it for 30 minutes so probably have lots to discover yet.  Felt like I was astral traveling in another dimension. The fact that you can experience something like this in immersive 3D with the Vive is truly amazing and something which was impossible not so long ago. One can only wonder how far this can be taken. I'm sure I will be surprised and blown away even more as this software matures.
,Not Recommended,500470,30253658,Posted: 28 February,all,::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::,"While I personally believe its very important to be supporting developers who try things new in VR, I don't believe this project is ready to be sold as a product on the steam market. The ease of usability is practically non-existant. The scale function scales the fractal from its object position, not the player position, making it extremely difficult to explore the fractal. There is only one movement control, and thats forward, so if you are interested in this game because you want to navigate and explore the detailed fractals in VR, you probably wont be able to properly do that until the developer improves this game.Also, it really needs antialiasing, as there is flickering everywhere, and there is a black box around the field of view, so you aren't even getting a real VR experience."
