76561197968496198,Recommended,500480,28409031,"Posted: 16 December, 2016",all,Zaptruder,"Early access game - so reviewing it with that in mind.Good polished presentation. The models and art style looks great.The 3 bot types present adequate and different, escalating challenge.The 1 arena is nice, and littered with a variety of objects to pull up and throw and use as clubs.The physics is actually pretty good. Not perfect, but more than serviceable, and great for punching and clubbing the bots.Locomotion comes with arm swinger (and a monkey panic mode where you swing it above your head to run backwards) and teleportation modes.Played with monkey move mode (as I'll be calling all arm swinger locomotion games from now), and had a blast using boxing tactics on the bots; getting in close as an in boxer, or staying further out as an out boxer. Something that can't be said for Thrill of the Fight in my modestly scaled room.Promising game and a good demo of what can be achieved in a melee fighting game when locomotion is added.What I'd like to see more of:More bots, more levels, more objects to pick up and hurl. More dynamics (there was a car driving around in the level - maybe we'd get to see cops and military roll up and ineffectually blast us and allow us to use it as fodder for throwing stuff at the opposing robots).Maybe more customization system for your bot - pick the arms/weapons, pick the chassis (heavier/more damage/lighter/faster), some progression stuff to make the pull through the game more compelling... so basically your normal game like features.Better damage response to the player. Right now it blurs out the screen when you get hit... but it's not that meaningful - hard to tell how much damage you're taking, and easy to confuse it for - they're just too close to you kinda blur.The opposite - damage response to the enemy is quite good. They get knocked around a bit and they turn red, making it obvious you've struck a blow.TL:DRIf you're looking an innovative melee 1v1 fighting game that looks and plays in a fun way, that allows for movement and zoning - Fist of Physics is a great title at a reasonable price."

There is a sufficient amount of combat to entertain until you unlock freeform mode. Then once you've done that, there's just 3 more rounds and the game is basically finished. Punching, shoving, throwing enemies and clobbering enemies with stage props are all in the game right now. No waiting for future updates that may or may not come.There are 3(?) different weapon types. Of the these, the sword seems particularly good at dismembering enemies. The axe may be able to as well, but it felt much easier to accidentally dismember with swords. The hammer seems to have the longest reach. If there were additional weapons, they're unremarkable.You may want to regularly switch to open hand combat so you gain access to throw/shoving. It can help tip the outcome in your favor."

Devs, you may want to implement a ""Containment unit"" or something for your robot police force to put up. :)"
,Recommended,500480,28394562,"Posted: 15 December, 2016",all,Tyrrin,I bought this on a whim for my 7 year old to keep him occupied for a few minutes while I was cleaning. He played for almost an hour straight and was completely exhausted by the end; headset was drenched. He is now asleep next to me on the couch!The game is like VR Rock'em Sock'em Robots! Lots of fun! Worth every penny...
,Recommended,500480,28658797,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Circa Survive,"This is a great first take on translating giant robots to VR! The core mechanics are really fun. It's satisfying as hell to bat a big lumbering bad guy around the map. I certainly hope the final release has a lot more content to offer (which seems to be what the devs are doing), but it's a lot of fun as is. Great way to work up a sweat too!"

There's three robots to fight, and they just loop over and over in sequence but a bit tougher each time. You unlock new weapons every time you beat the third one. At the moment, that seems to be pretty much it.It really is fun, though. It feels responsive and satisfying and as the difficulty ramps up you do need to get used to blocking and counterattacking rather than just flailing like mad until you win. I think it'll be something I fire up for fifteen minutes every now and again to punch some robot face, so I'm looking forward to seeing what gets added in future. Thumbs up from me!"

Just needs alot more content than just fighting three robots over and over again."

The gameplay is immersive as well.The title Fist of Physics is a little bit misleading. It feels more like a sandbox game than a boxing game IMO. Throwing cars, and chopping off robots' limbs are hilarious."

This game is essentially: smack  your arms around until you SOMEHOW take their health down. Nothing is real about this game in the slightest, nothing feels real. The weapons do close to nothing in terms of damage, nor does punches. I got past most of the enemies without having any idea which of my punches would actually do damage. It seemed very random; the physics are okay, but still need a lot of work. Most of my attacks seemed to have no affect on any of the opposing bots. The concept is very good, just needs a lot of work in gameplay."

Who knew beating up robots with my bare hands could be so fun. I cant wait to see what they add next....More opponents, different lvls, more weapons hahaha!!! After a couple rounds i unlocked a weapon and it really changed how I went about the match...Tried to see what i could remove from the robot while fighting lol....I removed a head and arms from one guy and couldnt stop laughing while i finished the match. they did a great job with the lvl design i cant wait to see whats next!! Great job guys!!!!"

76561198136456041,Recommended,500480,29831384,Posted: 10 February,all,uking.yukeqing,"At the first sight, I thought it's another boxing game. The gameplay is pretty fun and the experience is very immersive. You drive a two-floor-high robot to fight with other enemy robots in SF city.Then after playing several times later, I realized it's much more than a just boxing game happening in a simple arena. You have an environment around you with tons of details to explore. The cartoony art style is wonderful. The modeling and texturing are decent. Besides being pretty, all the buildings, fountain, and other small objects are destructible. I really enjoy this kind of interaction experience, like I break one traffic light and use its pole to fight against the enemy. And this game provides two kinds of locomotion control, transporting and arm-swinging. You could freely move around no matter you are escaping from the enemy or just playing with the environment.So far in this early access version of game, I think the gameplay still could be pushed more. Various weapons are cool but I would like to experience differences among them more from fighting feedback than visual appearance."

76561197997430967,Recommended,500480,28399310,"Posted: 15 December, 2016",all,cliff,"Ironic name.  ""Levels"" and power-ups?  Check!  Giant robots? Yes.  Destructable environments?  Sorta.  High production values?  Again, yes, in many places.  So promising, but this still needs lots of work to make it more than moderately fun.It's true that the worst part about this game is the physics.  Pick up a car and chuck it at the bad guy.  It will end up somewhere random because the physics model sucks.  It also floats away like a helium balloon, not a 4,000lb car.  Hitting the robots results in nearly no reaction, besides using the hammer on Glass Jaw III's head, which is how the game should be.  Closing your fist with the trigger results in no in-game hand movement, which breaks immersion.If you can fix the physics (or just use a real physics engine, this is a solved problem and you're reinventing the wheel), add 5x more enemies, a LOT more powerups, and environments, then it could be a winner.  I'll revisit if they fix it as VR needs some more fighting games."

There is 3 weapons to earn and 3 Robot bad guys to fight. They should add tank/helicopper or smaller robot waves inbetween the main robots, it would add a bit more play time. Overall fun game $10 is a bit high but it is in early access so should get better.Check out my Video Gameplay Here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSd5dFeCzC8"

Really?Asks for my initials after every single round. After typing this you press the ""Done"" button. After this,you are presented with two buttons, one of which is labelled ""Done"" and in the same place as the original Done button. PRESSING THIS WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO THE MAIN MENU. Poor UX design is an understatement.I understand this is in early access but it is just not fun to play."

The hits do very little to your enemy, and when you do manage to slightly damage the enemy after about 30+ swings, their health replenishes.The tutorial tells you to reach behind your head to grab a weapon, but nothing happens.  It has a power up button that also appears to do nothing.When you pull the triggers, you can see the ghost image of your fists close but the actual robot fists attached to your hands do nothing.This game is broke.  So sick of these weak, unfinished VR games polluting steam.  Shovelware is a cancer.  It's poisoning the experience, and further discourages people from VR, which will ultimately hinder it's potential if it continues.BE RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPERS!  YOU'RE RUINING THE PARTY WITH GARBAGE LIKE THIS!"

Before i punched the wall i punched a few other out of bounds things too (that were softer) because of how hard to see the wall is, even more so when it's in the robot you're trying to punch."
