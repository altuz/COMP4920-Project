Seems to have all the bells and whistles you could ask for and the interface is clean, easy to navigate and, unlike some of the other video players out there, this one seems built ground up for Vive and is very professionally done. It supports 2D and 3D including FIsheye w/180 or 360 and SBS or OU. I've tried all my VR adult titles and it plays them all nicely. Also, it has brightness, contrast, hue, etc you name it. And it has built in Supersampling and edge sharpening. So.. for $7, this is awesome! Time to say goodbye to my other video players out there."
,Recommended,500500,24419352,"Posted: 19 July, 2016",all,FitzWM,"This is my first Steam review. Trying to get into the habit and wanted to start with a good one.Simple VR Player is, without a doubt, the best VR media player on the market. It beats its competition in nearly every area, and what small problems I have with it are more than offset by the intuitive interface, the graphics options, and the control you have over your UI.Compared to Virtual Desktop, it has:+ An intuitive motion interface. You won't really appreciate what a difference this makes until you use it, but once you do, you'll never want to go back to VD. It's easy to move, resize, and angle the screen however you like, and you can do the same with the menu, which is a completely separate floating element. Buttons do what you expect them to do, and the only way I can think to improve it is if they either made the laser pointer brighter or gave an option for touch controls. Honestly, ust the fact that you don't have to Alt-Tab to a separate window just to change settings is a godsend.+ Detailed SSAA and MSAA options. Yeah, both. SSAA up to 2.0 and MSAA up to 8x. Plus, the ""Super Enhanced"" mode adds a touch of contrast and sharpness to the image, which helps combat HMD fuzziness. With my 1070, I have all three options maxed and never drop below 90 FPS. Looks gorgeous.+ Screen curvature control. VD only allows you to choose between curved and not-curved.+ 3D distance / tilt / height controls. For your Internet research.+ Price. Even at full price, Simple is barely more than half the price of VD. With the discount, it's a no-brainer.= Environments. There aren't as many (or as high quality) as in VD yet, but they're (a) all you really need to get going and (b) free. Plus, there's a pure black one! Maybe I'm the only one who really wanted that, but I'm glad it's there.= Easy access to 2D / 3D / SBS / OU. VD has hotkeys, and Simple has buttons. Six o' one.= Can play anything. If the filters you pick can play it, so can the player.- Limited filter selection. VD simply displays whatever program you use to play media, so it can use just about any filter that you can get working on your system. Simple takes more of the responsibility on itself, so it has to have support for the filters. Right now, it offers the Windows built-in, DirectShow (LAV), VLC, and PopMedia. The default is godawful because it always is, and VLC is as middle-of-the-road as usual, but the LAV Filters look fantastic. Still wish I could use mpv, like I do in VD and everywhere else I watch anything.- Only does playback. VD allows you to use your desktop, play most games, and basically do whatever with your computer. If you want to play games on the big screen, either get VD or hope it works with Steam's thing. Since I already bought VD a while back, I'm just going to use it for games and Simple for media.Compared to Whirligig (which I haven't nearly used as much as VD), it has:+ Much, MUCH more intuitive interface. Whirligig has probably been the best 3D player out there, but actually using it is practically a case study in bad UX. Simple is...well, simple.+ Plays everything, not just 3D. I THINK Whirligig is limited to 3D, but again, I haven't put a lot of use into it.= All 3D controls you need. It's just easier to actually use them with Simple.- A few research companies assume Whirligig, so they have config settings, etc, for it. They could be translated to Simple, I suppose, but that's work.As you can see, Simple wipes the floor with the competition as far as pure media consumption is concerned. VD offers a more full-featured computing experience, but if you just want to watch some bloody movies, Simple's got you covered. I'd welcome a more visible laser pointer and mpv support, but even this initial release makes the other players look like amateur hour."
,Recommended,500500,31386706,Posted: 26 April,all,byteframe,"I think I paid $9.99 for this, long ago. I needed it real bad, ya heard, and the free/old whirligig was, like.... whuuut? It still holds up as a easy to use, but also capable VR video player. I'm not an expert, and 360 video is kinda lame anyways, so I don't know much about the alternatives. There's a chance you might still want this. The Vive player didn't have as many options as this (although I did not test 360 there), and Simple Video Player also allows you to change the media framework. It would probably rule the roost, if it were made free, but I'm not an aficionado.Você é dez anos mayumi não clique.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=891488562"
,Recommended,500500,24443439,"Posted: 21 July, 2016",all,ippino,"Some comments first, I hope the developers will read.First of all, thanks to the developers for making the best VR video player on the market.However, while it is the best player, it does NOT yet provide the best EXPERIENCE when whatching movies, and especially 3D movies.The reason is simple: the environments. Only a few environments are available now and none of them is what you want when you watch a (3D) movie. An exception might be the ""black"" environment, which is similar to what you have when you are in a movie theatre. However, in order to fully ""catch"" the full depth of a 3D scene, your brain needs to ""compare"" the scene with som surrounding object...which you don't have in the black environment (nor in any of the other environments).In other words, please, ADD A MOVIE THEATRE ENVIRONMENT!The best would be to exploit the worksop and be able to choose/download any possible available scenario, including movie theatres.In my opinion, ""CINEVEO - VR Cinema"" offers the best cinema experience so far, and especially for the 3D movies. It features a fully functional multiplayer movie theater in virtual reality, where you can even choose your seat.About the player:- This is the best VR video player on the market- It is really easy to use, powerful, and full of features. Everything you read in the description is true :)- Everything is super intuitive, you don't need any manual- The Saveable 180/360 Settings Unique For Each Video is very useful. However, it should not be limeted for 180°/360° videos only. Also, the size and distance of the screen should be saveable!- By installing LAV codecs and selecting ""Directshow"" as Video Decoding Engine under Options->Super Advanced Settings, you can basically play every video.- Perfect support and smooth play for 180°,360°,3D SBS/OU videos.- Curved screen is good, but since we are in a ""spherical"" VR environment, the screen should be a ""sperical section"" (as in CINEVEO)""Super Sampling Resolution"" + ""Super Enhanced Mode"":this is something really cool. We all know that one cannot expect HD quality when watching movies with VR devices (HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, etc...). The quality is actually very low when compared to a 3D moitor or with the 55"" 3D TV in your house :)However, by combining ""200% Super Sampling Resolution"" + ""8X Anti Aliasing"" and enabling the ""Super Enhanced Mode"" I have to admitt the quality greatly improves. Thanks for this super cool feature!MISSING/REQUESTED features:- Please ADD A MOVIE THEATRE ENVIRONMENT! (as in CINEVEO)- add Saveable Settings Unique For Each Video also for NON-180/360 videos- add Saveable or customizeable default values also for screen size and distance- add more environments. Add download of environments from the Steam workshop.- curved screen is good but, ""sperical section"" screen is best (as in CINEVEO)- add support for online (facebook, youtube, Vimeo, etc...) 3D 180/360 videosThat's it for the moment.Thank you and(I apologize for my english, it's not my mother language)"

The File extantion must be written in lower cases like ""avi"", not ""AVI"" . Otherwise it woun't find the video. This could be a problem for self made movies because by default many cam corders save the file in upper cases.Maybe this will be fixed some days.Another thing that could be ""slow motion"" or ""Skip to next Frame"". Maybe even with the Vive Touchpad by by rotating the finger around.The 180° and 360° view is ok.... looks a bit strange. But the Curved feature is realy great.I also tested 3D Movies. In combination with the curved option it's realy impressive.I've got a Vive and a GeForce 960 and it works great.// Edit:A few month later, this is still the best VR Video Player i've seen. Many features where added, most videos are working. In some Video Files the Audio isn't working. I'm not sure but i think those a videos with multiple audio streams in different languages.I'm realy a big fan of this Video player.

No more having to either remove the vive headset to make sure I'm pressing the right keys, or otherwise fumbling to press a specific button.It offers a lot of options to help make those ""VR"" videos look like they're supposed to.It's very stable and I don't think I've ever had any problems with it crashing or bugging out.Things I don't like:Not all of the options are obvious and you have to poke around a bit in the advanced menusI can't really think of too many things to dislike about this.

In order for my h265 files to play, there is an added option in advanced to change the default library used for the codec. Switched to Directshow and voila!The user interface is really awesome. Switching the output to 3d (180 or 360 degrees i think?) and then scrolling through your directories is quite intense. Like looking down 20 stories from the top of a building intense. You can hide the controller by the grip, and it fully integrates touch. Played around with the eye offset to make it pop more, but tend to wonder, am i gonna go cross eyed!The experience was really great once I understood how to switch libraries. Watched ""Man of Steel"" on what was equivalent to a 30 ft screen and about 15 ft away. My own personbal Imax. I like how you can rotate the screen too so you can really relax and still see the full screen.The super sampling and Anti alaising really diminish the granular look you get from the headset too. Im running a 6850k with a 1080 and 64 gigs of ram. I had zero issues with any frame drops.I havnt tried desktop viewer, so I have no comparison to give. Other players on the store for VR are pretty frustrating. Why even make a Windows media player equvalent in a 3d environment that can only display 2d, and with horrible and convuluted menus and controls!Highly recommend this product if you want to watch 3d Blurays! Seems like they are making consistent and valuable updates for this too."

May compensate for bad scale in 3D recordings!- It's not playing all standard movies (x264 ac3 dts mkv) and I think it's something with the audio formats.- Enoying: Touch button scroll inversed if you compare to steam vr scroll.

,Recommended,500500,25390424,"Posted: 6 September, 2016",all,Polysorbate,Works really good for pretty much anything once you find the option to use libVLC playback.  Based on my experience I think this should either be the default or at least made a more visible option instead of buried under a nested menu.The native VR interface is far superior to controller or mouse-based input offered by Virtual Desktop or Whirligig.  Simple VR Video Player's native configurable supersampling/anti-aliasing options make it a far better video viewer than Virtual Desktop in my opinion.

The name says it all, it's simple and it seems do do everything very well. I'm real happy that there are brightness and contrast controls. You are able to squeeze out the best possible image on the headset. I really like watching 3D movies with a VR headset due to the lack of crosstalk and the app does a great job. It's certainly worth the low price and I'm sure it will only get better."

,Recommended,500500,29932700,Posted: 14 February,all,HYPER,"Hands down, this is the best VR video player you can get right now. Why? Because it's simple, clean and very easy to use with your Vive controllers. I also own Virtual Desktop and I tested Whirligig, but both have pretty annoying interfaces. Simple VR Video Player offers you a pretty intuitive and super clean UI with fully working motion controls, which is an absolute game-changer in comparison to Virtual Desktop. Browsing through your data is so much better here! You also have a bunch of additional options to improve the video quality or re-adjust some settings for 3D movies - everything relevant is implemented.So, if you are looking for a super clean and simple VR video player with all relevant settings, then this one here is your way to go. Don't waste your money on Virtual Desktop until they fix the UI flaws and offer more options. If you really need that ""desktop feature"", then you should try BigScreen (free right now)."
