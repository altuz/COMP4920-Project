,Recommended,500580,24628939,"Posted: 31 July, 2016",all,Lord Crocosquirrel,"Puzzle games... What to say about them? Mechanically, they're dead simple. Figure out a way to carve up a picture so that the pieces interlock, scatter them around the outside of the board, and let the player go to town. If you've seen one, you've seen them all.Until Cute Overload Simulator 2016. Don't bother with the ""official"" title of this game-- this game ( and the canine version elsewhere on Steam), have such a plethora of cute critters on board that the game is like to give you diabetes-- The instantly lethal kind.As for this particular puzze game, it has that sort of quality that keeps my mother going down to the shop to get more: The puzzles in the first area are easy, and they get harder as you progress through the levels. Not just the number of pieces, but also the quality of the pictures for this purpose. Four levels of 21 images each give you 84 images overall for the main game, with stars awarded, Angry Birds-style based on the time you take to complete that image.If I had to give the Devs suggestions, I would recommend that they ditch the lock-in when a particular piece is in the correct location, and add rotation to the individual pieces as an option to make things a bit more difficult for the Players. it would add much, I think, to the replayability of the game and make it worth another couple of bucks.Speaking of, I'm of the impression that the devs could easily charge a bit more for this game on the PC market, which is usually receptive to a bit more in terms of price than the mobile market, assuming that the game isn't buggy on launch.For $1.99 USD, cat fanciers and purveyors of cuteness everywhere could do far, far worse.Although I did wonder if it would kill the devs to get some music in-- a soundtrack tailored to each individual image by activity/mischief level would go over very well."

,Not Recommended,500580,32219508,Posted: 6 June,all,[ReAp]Veronica Vamps🦇,This Game is a cute Jigsaw Puzzle Game which is made very casually. I personally love cats and own one myself however I found that game to be quiet boring. Its alot like the Windows App Jigsaw which you can download and literally puzzle any picture you would like.In my opinion this game is not worth 2€ maybe 80 cents. The Atmosphere is very quiet and its not very challenging either. I do love cats and jigsaw puzzles but I also like to have it a bit difficult like the Pixel Puzzle Games.I would love to see a difficulty level and some Achievements for this Game in the future otherwise it is just really boring.

,Recommended,500580,33238116,Posted: 4 July,all,leenix,"Great game, high replayability... One of those games that just get better and better the more you play it. By the way, his is one of those games that took me forever to finally install and play it, its like one of those movies that took you forever to watch because you expect it to be something else but then it turns out into something greater than you've imagine and then you ask yourself, why didn't I watch this movie before? Amazing soundtrack, very addictive and intriguing puzzles, so original. Highly Recommend it. Also, it is a nice and fun tho brainstorming game. It uses physics to reach out of the levels. At the end the credits are kind of touchy and emotional. Awesome story and just enjoible game overall <3 10/10"

,Recommended,500580,25521324,"Posted: 15 September, 2016",all,Tubular,"This is honestly the best game ever. The physics engine is beyond anything CryEngine can think of. The tactile feedback on each piece is second to none. The thrill of each move watching the clock tick down, star after star disappearing into oblivion as you strive to put back together the kitty cat once torn asunder! Photo realistic I cannot determine what is pixels and what is real life.12/10 no update required.Spoilers: They are mostly cats."
