76561198369785936,Recommended,500670,32154371,Posted: 3 June,all,Aleks Kuzmanovic,"TxP is a fast paced twin-stick arcade shooter. (I mean REALLY fast-paced). It brings some very interesting and fresh mechanics to the table. You're equipped with two weapons (machine gun + shotgun) throughout the entire game, but where it gets interesting is how the weapons interact with the environment and one another. You will get weapon upgrades by performing skill shots and by killing enemies in creative and brutal ways.The game comes with several bosses... and oh man... they're tough! Everything can be killed with a single shot, but when all the craziness is happening you'll find it exceptionally difficult to find an opening to slaughter the powerhouse bosses. The sound design is incredible.If everything above sounds interesting to you, then I would definitely encourage you to pick this game up. It is definitely worth the asking price!"
,Recommended,500670,32137613,Posted: 2 June,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Tormentor X Punisherreminds me a lot ofDevil Daggers. And that's a great thing.What we have here is an arena twitch shooter that has a few layers of complexity to peel off. Once you begin to learn how things work, you begin to get better.Tormentor X Punisherhas a nice layer of polish and edge. The music and dialogue are fantastic. Really gets me amped up.I think the highpoint here is the edgy female protagonist coupled with the interesting 'level up' system.Definitely as fresh as the planet you are on.Pros:+Well polished arena shooter that rewards knowledge of the system+A must have to those that really got intoDevil Daggers+Music and voice acting are top notch and just take this experience to the next level+Controller support feels great+Cool bosses+Price point fits well (check out the serious hours that other reviewers have logged)+Steam leaderboards are a great addition to these kinds of gamesCons:-If you are looking for storyline, permanent progression, or really anything beyond an arena shooter - look elsewhere (I only warn of this because that was some of the criticism ofDevil Daggers)If this is your jam,Tormentor X Punisheris well worth the small asking price."
,Recommended,500670,32160876,Posted: 3 June,all,Samurai Jack TH,"Stellar sound design and I love the (adult swim cartoon or saturday morning cartoon) comic visual effects! It reminds me of those flash arena old school games I used to play back in the days endlessly :) in a very good way!The synchronization of the sound of the shotgun's blast and the design of the music creates this atmospheric sense of heart beat that feels very vital and ""in your face"". Thus, the established relationship between the gameplay's sound elements and the diegetic sound mixing is stylistically significant to the whole atmosphere of the game, and further allows the audiences to suspend their disbelief in a short adrenaline burst within this fantasy world.This game is straight-up visceral action, and doesn't include all the fat that feels unneccessary to the overall game. Everything feels neccessary and integral to the vision of the game.The dev is also a sound designer for Nuclear Throne, which also has an amazing sound directions that adds a whole new level of immersion to the game :DThe Devs are very responsive and nice too.. Pls support this game :) I want this game to keep on developing with more levels and expansions because the universe that they set up here is freaking amazing"
,Recommended,500670,32163559,Posted: 3 June,all,Dreamparacite,"Just checked this game out on a whim based on a tweet I saw explaining the mechanics (reload your machine gun by shooting your shotgun, last bullet in a clip shoots fire, etc) and after seeing the the gameplay and animated intro I was sold.It has the enemy progression and high score driven gameplay of Devil Daggers with the humor and ultra violence of Super Jail!, which leads to satisfying gunplay with simple controls where you always want to try just one more run. And as an added bonus, the soundtrack is great. This is a game I'll likely come back to over and over."
,Recommended,500670,32158165,Posted: 3 June,all,Rayharry,"Such nasty language in this game! :DI'm not gonna lie, I didn't know what the heck was going on for the most time. The gameplay is absolutely chaotic, and random. The little goblin creature which comes to mock you after your death was a cute feature, that could be improved further. It was more interesting to wait what it had to say than seeing your next enemy type. The boss enemies are well-made.I don't know what else to write really. The intro at the beginning was really neat, gameplay and controls were solid. That's the most important aspect of a topdown shooter like this, right? Didn't see any bugs, but through all the chaos and bloody mess it would've been hard to spot them anyways :)EDIT: And oh, by the way... If you have any problems with motion sickness in video games, then you should probably avoid this title. Especially if you have epilepsy or something serious like that. I don't usually get any effect from screenshake and fast movement, but even I couldn't imagine playing this game other than in small bursts."
,Recommended,500670,34090134,Posted: 7 August,all,YADANGUS,HOLY S H I T  I LOVE THIS GAME.Nuclear Throne/Devil Daggers/Hotline Miami. I adore all those games so I adore this game.These types of twin stick shooters are a dime a dozen but Tormentor X Punisher stands out on it for its extremely vulgar/in your face aesthetic and it's excellent combat.Quite possibly the most Punk Rock game I have ever played
,Recommended,500670,32141113,Posted: 2 June,all,Krugear,"This game is just pure fun.. If you like the gameplay from the likes of Nuclear Throne, you will have a blast. It's also surprisingly deep: You need different strategies for the different powerups and finding that out is so rewarding.It gets my full recommendation"
76561198070083951,Recommended,500670,32472444,Posted: 16 June,all,Sadyka,"As soon as I watched the introduction trailer, I was hooked immediately. I love how gritty and just raw/vulgar it is. Then when I was the actual gameplay, It reminded me of the good ol' days of DOOM etc but condensed into a tough kill or be killed type of game.Pros:-Voice Actress' voice is amazing and fits the tune of this game extremely well.-Conincides with this point ^ , but the lines just make it fun regardless of how vulgar and overused the ""F"" word is-The simple shotgun mechanics, that later develop from upgrades-The artwork, it just adds to the nitty gritty atmosphereCons:None, so far imoHopefully the developers continue working on this game, I'd love for more bosses / (Weapons?) / enemies and maybe some different environments.But for what it is now, $8 was a great price for such an addictive experience. You always come back trying to go higher than you have before. (Currently stuck at 110k points!)"
,Recommended,500670,34090137,Posted: 7 August,all,Ikubi,"This is without a doubt, my favorite arena shooter I have ever played. If you have ever liked Total Carnage, Geometry Wars, Smash TV, or really any other top down omnidirectional shooter, you owe it to yourself to give this a try. It even has local coop, for those of you always searching for new couch multiplayer games.Tormentor X Punisher is a score attack and leaderboard centric arena shooter focused on nonstop action, (you reload your machinegun by shooting your shotgun) where everything dies in one hit including all bosses, and yourself. It's great for the ""just one more round!"" effect because matches will last at most 5 minutes, and it takes about 7 seconds to go from dead, to being in a new round.The 7 bosses are all unique, die in one hit, (yes, even priestess if you play your cards right) and actually modify the map in interesting and mostly permanent ways. Killing Gutshank will summon a giant spinning sawblade that will go around the perimeter of the level. Carrion will build walls and rooms throughout the arena as long as it lives.My absolute favorite mechanic in the game is the experience of discovering unexpected projectile/enemy/boss interactions. As you play, you'll go from hating and not understanding specific bosses and enemies, to intentionally letting them live and baiting out their attacks, so you can turn them against their friends. Snitch will go from ""ugh, this boss is pathetic."" to ""Finally! An opportunity to clean up my wall infested arena!"" Gutshank will go from ""Why the hell does this guy keep building robot versions of himself!? This is impossible to deal with!"" to ""I haven't seen a gutbot in 6 hours of playtime."" This gradual transition induced by your growing mastery applies to normal enemies too. You will go from hating wizards, to wishing more of them appeared later in the game for that sweet, sweet weapon upgrade.The amount of tiny details and careful thought put into every game mechanic, visual effect, and ""gamefeel"" trick is honestly rather staggering, and I could write an essay on those aspects alone. Every summoning circle pulses to the base drum of the music. The circles summon demons ALSO to the base drum rhythm. The UI pulses to it. Enemy projectiles slow slightly when right next to you, to allow for an extra fraction of a second to nullify them with your shotgun. Shooting a fireball with a shotgun will turn it against your enemies. Every single shell casing, shotgun shell, gib, summoning circle scorch mark, bloodsplattter, and corpse stays on the map forever, showing you the absolute carnage you've wrought. A little twerp of a demon runs up and brags about causing your death, despite never even daring to come into the arena until you've died SOLELY to induce in the player a personal vendetta against him. Each time a boss or hazard is introduced the camera highlights them, and all demons take a moment to cheer and bow before them. The survival timer will count up to 6 minutes and 66 seconds before correcting itself to 7:07, just so it can display a time of 6:66. It's the little things, you know?All in all, I have had an absolute blast with this game so far, and will be playing, and recommending it for months, or maybe even years to come. I've still got personal challenges to complete on video. Daehkcuf won't summon himself, and there's 7 bosses that are overdue for a single run, barehanded only killing."
76561198025034579,Recommended,500670,33440307,Posted: 10 July,all,mnemos,"Torementor X Punisher is a meat tenderizer to the face. It's a band of feral children chasing you through the woods, pelting you with acid gumballs. It's a genetically modified giraffe/hyena hybrid crunching on your bones under the glow of an alien sun. Devil Daggers is an obvious influence; they're both arena shooters that last as long as you can survive (not long), they both come at you as hard and fast as a rabid bear, and they both dare you with a manic glint in their eyes to play just one more game. There's a splash of Hotline Miami in the movement, and a streak of DOOM's garish neon hellscape in the aesthetics. The common thread between them all is the frantic, brutal combat. Initially it overloads your system and rockets past you, leaving you trying to make sense of it all while a demon casually caves your skull in for the nth time;  but then something clicks, the seconds start to stretch themselves thinner, pathways through the hordes of enemies begin to reveal themselves, and moments of clarity where your reticule and target align present themselves.These games all have a rhythm: Hotline Miami came in attenuated seconds of mapping out rough pathways through the carnage, instinctively anticipating the ebb and flow of combat, punctuated by staccato bursts of hyperviolence. DOOM is a screeching engine barely holding onto it's frame as you flay enemies and run circles around them, knowing you're fine as long as you're meting out more punishment than you're taking. Devil Daggers is maybe the most intricate of them all, the bursts of your weapon and careful weaving around and under enemies forming a sort of hellish ballet. Tormentor X Punisher is more brutish than any of them, and more unforgiving; it relies on randomization more then the others; enemies spawn in different places and bosses appear in different orders. In this way, it's more like roguelites like The Binding of Isaac and Enter the Gungeon.You quickly lose a sense of what to expect from each new round, making each one truly chaotic in ways that more closely curated games can't be. This works both for and against the game. Because you never know exactly what to expect, you never feel entirely prepared, and death is just as likely to come from a boss ability you don't understand as it is from a legitimate mistake. Tormentor X Punisher is a chaotic game to begin with, with enemies swarming you from every side and projectiles flying in from offscreen, and when it introduces a new hazard or boss it borders on unmanageable. As bracing as it is to lose yourself in the moment-to-moment carnage and rely purely on twitch reflexes, that's not enough to get you very far on the leaderboards. For that, you'll need to learn earn upgrades for ""creative kills"" (think trick shots like bouncing bullets off walls) and memorize boss patterns. The problem is that you're provided very little space to figure any of this out; normal enemies are invariably crawling down your throat by the time bosses spawn, leaving you with scant seconds to decipher how to eliminate them, all while fending off attacks on all fronts. The same goes for the special moves, many of which are well-hidden and, aside from a few, difficult to pull off with any regularity. In ways, feels like the game is intentionally hiding parts of itself from you. Though the mechanics do allow for a certain level of strategy, many of them are buried under a layer of unrelenting difficulty that most players will struggle to overcome.The presentation, meanwhile, is fantastic throughout. For all its bluster and gore and profanity (you'll hear ""♥♥♥♥"" approximately 3-4 four times a second), it's about as offensive as an 8-year-old who just learned to swear. I don't mean that as a criticism - if anything, it's endearing, and reveals a canny intelligence you might not expect from a game like Tormentor X Punisher. The voice acting is excellent, too; the demons snivel and whine and gloat over your corpse with all the bile you'd expect, and the heroine sounds positively unhinged - you can basically hear the chords in her neck standing out with every line, and see her bloodshot eyes bulging. It's in these smaller touches that you start to appreciate the care that went into Tormentor X Punisher. It's not an ambitious game, and it never reaches the virtuosic heights of it's inspirations, but the limited scope allowed its team to hone in on a something specific and execute it with precision. Tormentor X Punisher is brutal, chaotic, too difficult for it's own good, and hard to put down."
,Recommended,500670,32163365,Posted: 3 June,all,RemoveKebab,"Definitely a great game. The gameplay is really crazy and chaotic, but that's the whole point. Still haven't figured out how to kill some of the bosses & how to get the powerups, but the game makes me feel an urge to do it. You can get tired of that kind of gameplay, but again, that's not a complaint  -- It's really fun to play a round or two in a break. The ending goblin is hillarious, but could be even better. The shaking of the screen adds more madness to the atmosphere of the game, but I can understand all the nausea complaints, 'cause sometimes you really just loose the track of what's going on in the arena. And I really hate the shielders. U guys rock. Thank you for the game."

Your character is a foul-mouthed, gun-toting demon slayer, and mowing down the endless demon hordes is hilarious and fun.Plenty of variety in enemies, and you get rewarded for killing them in different ways. Bounce your shotgun's blast off a wall and into a demon's face for fun and profit!Be warned: YOU WILL DIE A LOT. But that's part of the fun, and death in Tormentor X Punisher is more of a speed bump than anything else."

Don't be put of by how difficult it seems at first, I myself was impresed by how getting passed just one boss seemed impossible for a while, but now defeating all of them in one run is completely feasible. The game has layers to it that make steady progression and improvement possible, which is my favorite part about it. Would absolutely recomend to anyone who likes top down shooters."

,Recommended,500670,32464949,Posted: 15 June,all,frweidner,"This game is a damn treat for Twin-Stick shooter fans.Other than tight and responsive controls and forceful weapons, it has one of the most rewarding upgrade systems I've ever encountered in a score-attack game. To get upgrades, you have to perform some ridiculous trickshots (and before that, you have to figure out what those trickshots ARE). Once you get an upgrade, you have it for the rest of your run, and they stack. So each run feels like you are carreening towards a fully upgraded character as you barely avoid death. At least for me, it tickled that ""improvement"" itch that much longer experiences usually have, but condensed into a tense and chaotic few minutes. And because the ""one more try"" restart happens in less than 3 seconds after dying, it's ridiculously easy to play over and over and over again, until you've sunk an embarassing number of hours into this game.Honestly, I think it's the best twin-stick shooter since Geometry Wars 2."

The controls are tight, the gameplay is fair, and I can have fun whether I live for 30 seconds or 3 minutes (yes, I'm not very good yet). By achieving certain feats in game you can unlock upgrades within that playthrough so there are certainly elements of planning and strategy along with the pure gameplay skill required."

I was on the search to find more like those games and I discovered this. I was at PAX East 2017 and I had the privilage to play this game on the floor. Holy Crap I was impressed. This replayability via the random level is fantastic. The graphical style is rigut up my alley and the game sounds in terms of music and sound effects fit nicely together.

Lucky thing is, this game is so simple that you don't need 2 hours to experience the entire game SO you can easily buy, try for an hour and if you DON'T like it, return it. The store page mentions 'upgrades' but I have no idea what they're talking about. You play 30 - 60 second rounds before dying from some un-seen attack, the rounds are complete chaos. The execution is excellent, but the depth is void. What you see in the trailers is exactly what you get, 'upgrades' are more like achievements from what I can see, but the games way too hard to get any of them for me. It does have local co-op, runs just fine. The game seems to have no video options, it automatically selects the resolution it wants. All in all it is a fun game, my only complaint is after playing Kingdoms, a game that appears to be very simple but in actuality is hiding tremendous depth, this is actually as shallow as it appears. My only hope for this game in it's long run will be to add workshop support for the 'arenas'. As it seems to stand now there are 2, maybe 3 arenas. There are no 'levels', where you start is where you die, just one big rectangle of a single doorless room. You run in circles blasting until you die. When you restart the background can change. Even in the hour I played, I got rather bored with the two backgrounds in the game, they are extremely simple. There feels like a serious lack of investment in game assests here. For the $6.80 I paid for this on sale, I feel like I barely got what I paid for, fun gameplay aside, there really is very little game content, I feel like the bulk of what I paid was to cover the cost of the intro video, because that's where the majority of the development effort feels like it went."

The game also has some very smart mechanics that make the game just a bit better, like how the protaganist will do a melee attack when you are out of ammo so you don't just die instantly, and there is almost never a time when you can't be firing the gun aside from a few frames of reloading if you're spamming the shotgun. After playing at PAX i went home and bought it instantly, and I don't think i'm gonna regret that decision at all.8/10"

I'll stick to Isaac or Just Get Through in future."

This is a great thing for somebody whose time is limited — as long as you have really friggin' fast reflexes. The game's speed is so fast that in the initial gameplay trailer, I assumed they sped-up the game footage by 200%. Nope. It's just that quick. Most runs for me didn't last more than a minute and a half, which in this game's terms is nothing to balk at.Hope you like dying a lot!-M.
