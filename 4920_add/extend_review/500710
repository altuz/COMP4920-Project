He proceeded to follow me and harass me (and keep killing me as a fresh spawn). This guy would hop servers trying to find me. He was also a veteran P2W premium player who wore the stuff from before the steam release. This wasn't the only guy who did it either. What a horrible playerbase. Give it a few months to a year and this game will be most certainly full of cancerous players only or empty.I don't get why people kill the community they need so much. When this game dies a few months down the line in population, don't be crying that there's no one playing because you ran them off.LEARNING CURVENothing is explained in the game except the obvious. It's like being shown how to operate a plane and the tutor says ""Okay, this is the steering wheel and the thing in front is a propeller. GO!"". It has such a slow pacing, worse than LIF:YO.MECHANICSYou literally spend hours gathering materials and half your time gathering materials you'll be gathering food and finding ways to keep your hunger up. You get hungry every 2 minutes and nothing feels rewarding.TL/DR FINAL VERDICTYou also have to eat every other minute because the devs want you to fatten yourself up with food just like how you'll fatten their bank accounts with your wallet.Edit: They changed their response. Their original response was ""Why are you judge game on few player? That is weird"". The people who saw their original response bounced and they tried to cover it up."

Most online games are not like this.  I also love the PVE version.  Again many games do not have this and I dont like to fight.  It was tough at first to get the hang of avoiding predators but after a while you get the hang of that too.  I am a 76 yr old great-grandmother and love that the game keeps my mind active.  Improves my coordination and amazing how my side vision has improved watching for godsends and predators.  If every  'old' person played this game it would surely help their state of mind.  The body might decline but game keeps mind from declining.Great job guys.
76561197967985876,Not Recommended,500710,29997750,Posted: 17 February,all,Aceon,"Here is my comment and hope it will serve as a good reference to any players who intented to buy this game.Some of the good review for this game have been quite old and no reflecting the current game model.Over the past few month this game have gone from good to worst and the reason are as followSiege- the new siege mechanism now can only be done in a fixed interval. Player have no rights to choose the siege time. So the timing maybe at you work hours or sleeping hours depending on your timezone. Recently dev ""improve"" the siege making it now easy to siege and harder to build. Depending where you live you will lost your effort when you come back from work or sleep,Resource - The amount of resource needed to build your domain is ridiculously high. Important resource like iron is very limited. A map with 100 player can have as little as 60 node in the server at the respawn of 30-60 min. That is like at most 1 node and less per person. Player have to grind like mad to lvl up especially in the end game. The new insight  help to imrpove your lvl but you will often find you lack the resource to make the stuff needed for your lvling. Dev also mention they are looking to make endgame resource even more of a grind and harder to get.End game-  the game is fun while you are still at your starting stage that where most of the good reviews come in. However, as you reaches end game (iron tools lvl) you will find yourself in a grinding hell. mining, hunting and woodcutting. There is no one to PVP as everyone is busy with their grind.Developer - they are unlikely to listen to your comment or ideas and seem to have their owns ideas which they are going implement. Their command of english is not as good which resulted their patch note is a mess. For example"" Fixed a bug in the crucible and the crucible workshop, due to which it was possible to obtain steel, excluding costs of cast iron."" It did not specified that if you filled those 2 structure to fill up the slots you will lost your stuff. Afterwhich, they shamelessly claim this is the intended function and refuse to reinburse the players who maximise their production building. They seem to think the players are money trees and cutting corners in their ""fixed"". They also have no issue with implement feature that waste your time.So I will strongely recommend not to buy this game at the current state it is just a waste of money. There is no one to pvp and the current model is just a endless grind."

Not that this is a problem but when they find out your not Russian they steal from you and harass you as much as they can.The community isnt very helpful either, again mostly because there Russian and dont like non-Russians? With very little in the way of a tutorial and the Wiki is a mess your limited to where you can get info.The game isnt pay to win like some have suggested, i paid for the premium package and dont have an advantage, Just paying for a horse that cant die really.I really like the game though, the crafting will have you pulling your hair out and it is a complete grind but i guess thats what its all about. Its actually very similar to LiF: YO but a top down version. The only thing thats making me give it a negative review is the community and lack of tutorial or any kind of helpful info. The Devs also have an attitude problem.(UPDATE 12/6)So since my review there have been a few updates that have been for the worse. The game does now appear to favor people who pay. Buying premium time will give you a big exp boost on everything you do. There are a few other things ive heard but as im a premium player i dont know what they are but you can prob find the info online."
76561198057734650,Not Recommended,500710,33808187,Posted: 26 July,all,Peasant,"Wild Terra Online is a rather interesting game. I found and still find it to enjoyable from time to time however due to the current way the game functions I have begun playing it less and less as the game feels like it wants to trap players. The game is not very popular in the United States so most of the US Servers, whether they be PVE or PVP are often completely empty of players or at the very least the number of players ranges fewer than 10 per server. The game features a skill tree that is arguably a cornerstone of gameplay. Various resources can be found across servers however unless you max out all of your skills (which can take a great deal of time) you won't really have access to all of the resources. It should also be said that even if you max out all of your skills you will still be limited in what you can do as certain items require you to learn recipes to craft them. These new recipes are found in ""Godsends"" that randomly generate around the map and at times can be rather difficult to find. Furthermore even if you find a Godsend there is a good chance that the recipe fragments you get may be fragments to a recipe you already know. This is used for a ""Golden Plan"" which lets you craft certain items on all of their servers. So once you've maxed out your skills and learned all recipes, perhaps even all golden plans in order to keep your fortune it is very likely you will need to play this game routinely or your loot will be taken away. The game lets players claim land with dominiums however once you leave the game your dominium can keep your claim for only a set period of time until it breaks and then your base can be easily sacked. If you play on PVP servers you not only have to worry about your Dominium HP but your server's seige time as well. During seige time players can build siege engines and tear down walls then dominiums allowing your base to be sacked if you don't have good enough gear/skills or if you're just alone or offline. Every part of the way the game is centered around spending time playing the game. This would be fine if the game didn't punish players so severely for the time they're not playing. The one last thing that should be considered is that the game is still in early access. Perhaps the developers will fix or change things and I might return to Wild Terra someday. However that looks to be unlikely especially with their time consuming game having an ingame store that allows you to buy certain items and privledges that place wealthier players above others. Overall I would not recommend this game. In the short-term you might have fun, in the long-term you'll have wasted your money."
,Not Recommended,500710,28499462,"Posted: 20 December, 2016",all,Ironside,"I like this game kind of, but the hours do not fly by. I have played for 11 hrs and it feels like I have played 2 - 3 times as long.The game offers some for the old Ultima Online fans, along with the survival builder crowd. The problem is, there is absolutely no point to Wild Terra outside of 'just' base building. The terrain all looks the same with a never ending expanse of ground textures which ultimately look the same. You do not get a map, but you do get grind coordinates. At first I did not care, but after 10 hours of just aimless wandering and walking back towards your home, it got to me. Largely because the world of Wild Terra has no character, no thrill, or immersion. For example, imagine being the guy/gal who pulled players together and built a castle at the northern reach, defying wolf, bear, and play alike. There is just a flat terrian of repeatable images you'd see in a tablet game. I honestly nodded off while walking around.The game is very, very grindy and fairly unrewarding. While I do want to feel like I achieved something in the game and really built something, I really would like to see something other than a small, small, small, small advancement for my time.Currently you can kill a...BearWolfBoarDeersome ferret looking thing...HareBirdGooseand players.Other than that, you're not killing anything else. I guess once you get to kill bears easily, you're done playing unless you like PvP. There are not very many people online, but I found that with about 40 people online at the same time, resources become scarce at times.It is just not as fun as it could be."

,Recommended,500710,28667559,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Tetracross,"Hello,At the time of writing this, I am currently playing on the PVP server Golunar. So far I can say the game is very enjoyable but really requires a focused group to keep going. The crux of this game is it's best strength and it's biggest weakness: lack of handholding.Many players go into this game thinking that they can solo bears, solo foxes, and solo many others animals. There is also this thought that killing someone will not have consequences. Your actions do have consequences and people will take notice. Joining a new friendly group helps to alleviate this issue. Learning to fend for yourself can be hard but teaming up is a great way to avoid getting killed. Too many join and think they can solo. Progression in this game requires teamwork which involves varying amounts of diplomacy and conflict resolution.Is this a perfect game? no, it's an alpha. But I think a lot of the reason this game receives a bad rap is because of the initial impressions that some have given by clubbing new players. I am currently trying to alleviate those pains by bringing new players in or offering to help them on Golunar. If you need help, my in game name is Freik."

,Recommended,500710,28965334,Posted: 2 January,all,Vanyel,"Remember that this game is still in Alpha...First off, this game is not for the feint of heart or someone looking for the 'Easy Button' - you are going to die, you are going to work, and you're going to have to think.Second...if you're a crafter then this game is definately for you.  Ever since Istaria (aka Horizons), whether it's building a house, making that fine sword or elegant Chest Plate to whipping up a delacacy, I've been and will always be a crafter.There are a few minor issues, but all-in-all this is perhaps the most enjoyable alpha I've played - wouldn't be saying that if I didn't already have well over 100 hours in the game.  As long as the developers keep at it I can only see the game getting better and better...not to mention addictive like Civilizations.You start out quite primitive picking up stones and pieces of wood to craft primative weapons and tools that allows to make a Dominium (claim some land).  Food is always on your mind and you'll have to tend to that as well while you fashion your land, create better tools, weapons, and armor.  You learn as well for during your travels you will come across 'Godsends' - small stashes of Knowledge Fragments.  These allow you to learn how to craft higher grade items - some need only a single fragment while others require 3, 5 or even 10 fragments.  Learn enough and you can use what you've learned on any server.There is nothing more...fulfilling than watching your character grow, your knowledge increase and even more importanly watching your small piece of land develop into a massive holding complete with Castle.  Yes...you will eventually be able to build your own Castle.This of course all takes time...and some will say it is grindy but in a lot of ways this game mimics real life - nothing comes easy or for free.  If oyu want it you have to work for it and that makes it something you can sit back and smile about once you have accomplished that next goal.Pros: Crafting Galore - from tools, weapons, food, farming, and living structures everything is player made.  Large world which is supposed to grow as the population grows (supposedly this already happened once before I started playing) - an interesting concept indeed.Cons: Balance - some notable gaps in skills, crafts and combat...especially noticeable againt creatures that fight back - even wily old fox will decimate you early on.  Also noted in some foods...where an easy food can't be accomplished without a high level structure which makes it useless and thus it has to be skipped in order to advance cooking skills.  A few memory leaks that requires relogging (I have noticed that fleeing crows seems to have the largest impact).  There is very little documention and if not for those who have been playing for a while (the community is very helpful, at least on the PvE server) a new player would be completely lost and overwhelmed not to mention easily frustrated.I put up with a lot worse from games I spent 4-times as much on out of the box - so far I can say hands down this is the best money I've spent and would have paid two or three times more than what I did."

,Recommended,500710,28533126,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,America Has A Problem #LasVegas,"The Good-- 90's Isometric Interface/machination-- Solid crafting and base building system-- Medieval and tribal aesthetic-- Mounted combat-- Sandbox rootsThe Bad-- Sandbox roots. Good because there's enough 'free will' to explore most crafting/combat types with progression in each one, but there's not a lot of options available to you in terms of progressing or leveling up each skillset (except crafting), and you're forced to harvest from a node-like world (like The Forest or Subsistence) instead of being able to use absolutely everything on the map (like 7 days to die or Ark)-- Combat is definitely lackluster. It doesn't entirely suck, but projectiles and melee leave a lot to be desired.-- Recipes for crafting decent equipments and structures are gated and require a LOT of searching and grinding to find and unlock-- Population scarcity.The Ugly-- Every screen looks identical to the one before it. The only variation comes when you get an identical screen with snow covering the same backdrop you just saw 20 seconds before. Environments need a huge upgrade/expansion.-- Early hunting on anything other than a grouse or hare is frustratingly disparaging. A 120% quality bow still takes an average of 10 shots to down a deer, and more for a wolf or boar. Chasing animals gets to be a big ordeal that feels more cumbersome than rewarding.-- A nearly non-existent soundscape. Most of the sounds are recycled and there's not much variation between things like landing a javelin throw or hitting a tree. There's hardly any ambiance as well-- half the time you'll probably find yourself seeing if you didn't accidentally mute your computer because there's just no sound coming from the game.-- Everyone looks like identical twins. :-/-- Hunger system needs a revamp. The requirements are a bit absurd and unless you've got a good system going, staying fed becomes your primary focus/activity more than expanding your base does.I'd recommend this if you're a fan of isometric sandboxes lke Ultima Online. It feels almost like a successor at times (in the absolute most basic sense of the term), and I have a strong suspicion that this game will see a heavy improvement over the next year."

All you get from VIP is a small bonus on resources gathering SPEED, which normally takes about a couple seconds on normal accounts. You can buy mounts from the store, still you can aquire them in game easily.People complain about food. Food is the least of your problems once you know how the mechanics work. All these negative comments about food are from people who did not spend 2 minutes to understand how the system works. You can spend hours crafting and gathering eating almost nothing, not to mention the food is everywhere around you. Do not run, seriously, it will starve you in no time, running is supposed to be for emergencies and PvP engagements.Heard about people complaining about hackers going into bases and looting stuff, well that is absolutely incorrect.

As much I want to say that this is 100% great there are some flaws. I researched for about 10 mins when I bought it and while playing it there is very little info about the game. Most of the forums barely say anything and most of the wiki is brand spanking new. This is hardcore at best. Think of Force of Nature mixed with Rust.  Ive played this since saturday evening, changed servers twice. The first 3 hours I was aimlessly trying to gather stuff. I stared to build the first tier structures to enclose my base. Not knowing that I had to do the second tier because the first tier other players can easly get your gear. Think of thatch foundations for Ark. I notice that the spawn rates are very scarce. I had to look for coal, trees, and clay when I need to look for them and little to find but when i didnt i could find them everywhere.Early Access 9/27/17 Flaws - May change1. Browser based game. (I dont hate browser based games but when I have played this for at least three minutes the borders of the game would flicker and cover the moniter. OCD makes me twitch a little. If I catch up to the black parts the game seems to lag and force me to stop.2. Spawn Rates to need to be increase. Not saying from 1.0 to 5.0% just add a comfortable amount. Not sure the issue of whether the game is about player economy where you have to plant trees. If thats true, make saplings more accessible.3. Players in Survival Games - Only games I have ever had issues with people being rude and not friendly were Rust, and Reign of Kings. This game ""WTO"" noone talks and they wait for you to log off for the night or work the next day and they raid your base. Literally, inches away from other nodes to gather, they rather steal from you. Im really not sure about this game and the toxicity of the player base. This even happened on a pve server in the safer zones. To gain more playerbase make offline raiding harder like adding turrets or let your mounts be about to attack players. I could make more design for this if needed. (Email me Devs)4. Combat - Very little - For the week I have played, I had full bronze gear and have died to everything from a young fox to Big Bear. I understand this game is based on ""skill"" leveling and not more of a ""stat"" leveling like Diablo. You can have 1 mil strength and not be any stronger from the beginning. Ive checked all the updates from the devs and nothing about this system give any clarity.5. (a) GodSend / (b) Fragments/ (c) Items from the Cashshops - This game is not pay to win - now the game is still being developed and has a year or two of implementing new concepts and twinking to making the game more polish, not sure how big the dev team is but need to make your road map more clear. We the players need more incentive to play the game not saying to give us things but allow us to know what you are working on. You dont have to have big milestones but let us know whats coming to game and what bugs you guys need us to report.(a). GodSend's (c) CashShop - This feature has saved me from death and helped me gear my character. The game doesnt really give much description on what workstation does. Ive spent alot of time trying to learn how to make an effective bronze ingot. This should be easy to learn. I understand you guys are making dungeons and caves in the near futures so I cant complain much about the loot system.  I love it. Keep making more items to do this. This also allows players to gain items from the cash shop without paying. Ive gotten Premiums twice, and got 1 bronze key with two Bronze chests and Iron chest. Its accessible. This should be mention in any debate that the cash shop is pay 2 conveince. You can pay to get something now and not have to play the game or play and not pay and learn to get those items for free from money but pay in time.(b) Fragments - This is cool system, but where does it tell you how many you collect makes it to become a reciepe nothing online tells me that theres a hotkey to find the list of fragments youve encounter and click on the reciepe to learn known receipe. Or does it automatically implement in the crafting/building skill.Okay guys this is the flaws I love to hate. Please read to the end to get my final opinon of the game. With all these flaws the game seems pretty complete. It really just needs the player population to increase and polish, polish, polish. I rather play it through unity or udk, but from my experiences of making games myself you build your game on what you can do. Keep up the good work Devs and Ill be patient to see whats to come. The game is more about hardcore patience. Thank you."

Once you have decided on PVE lands with pvp zones or the full-blown open world pvp, you are dropped into your choice with nothing but a deep desire to gather and explore.  Animals are plentious but not all friendly.  Fashioning primitive tools allows you to  hunt rabbits, birds and small game while locating a suitable place to claim for your own.  A primitive house and a bed of branches lead up to further construction and production while watching over your claim from poachers who would take what they can reach.  The grind is not too grindy and the pace is relaxing.  Skills are gained by using them and death is very certain if you get too close to the dangerous bears, boars, wolves and other obvious predators.  But there are some much appreciated helps in the game.  Rather than a map, a floating icon always points in the direction of your home and/or your body as the case may be.  Building walls can protect your claim from poachers and give you room to set up production properly.  The game is in early access but already there is a wealth of things to do.  The crafting is of the typical gather this to make that, and there is lots to do.  It is very solo-friendly, at least in the PVE lands.  The most frustrating part of my first 15 hours was failing so frequently when my skills in a particular thing indicated low percentages of success - but it was expected and makes crafting a rewarding passtime.  There is a wiki but it is deficient of content.  Global chat seems to be the best way to get information on the many crafting stations already in the game.  This game has much potential and is already a fullfilling experience.  If you like sandbox crafting coupled with a survival experience, you will feel at home in Wild Terra.  Get it."

Only the early hours were fun and that was only due to the hope I had and before the Devs began revealing their true intent and ddirection. Which was about 40 of them, the hours since have only been logging in for a few minutes every week hoping things would change.  I DEEPLY regret this purchase, and the hours spent. I thought it would develope into what it appeared to be at first, a clone of Haven and Hearth. Yet I suppose the procedural map egenration as opposed to static map disallows all the mechanics of that type of game to exist, or they just don't want to. It's basically a POINTLESS game, you can craft crap, over and over and over. no real quality system, no real farming system, I only log in now once a week to keep my ""time-rented"" claim and the work it took to make it, if you don't log in for 7 days you lose it all. Now they plan on intriidcuing ""chests and keys""..LMAO whatver. Avoid it, it's not worth it, it is fun for a few hours but then, well, you will see the absolute pointlessness of the game in general. Below if my ""only had 4 hours"" review, you can see the hopes and now you see the end result. Do not bother, it is not worth supporting. It also became the most shocking SCAM game I've ever seen. They want you to pay 15$ just to own it, then to not have your ""home"" not decay or to make use of the ability to have your own server they want high as 15$ PER MONTH. Yes, they have a huge item mall, it is big time P2W (Or actually pay to progress). Never support these kind of rediuculous games. Russian Devs should tell you all you need to know it seems, at least in this case every stereotype is TRUE.And the post that got me banned, like most anyone who dares call them out. :sounds like the usual threats you've become known for in here.. Why you did what? What way? You mean you want me to ask you why you released a pay to play game, then months later implemented a subscription @ 15$ a month to create a huge feature devide between players who do and players who do not? Why would I need to ask you why you did that? Dissapointed in a game going in totally different direction than what it seemed when it was released and people laid out their money to support you? Yeah very much so. What kind of suggestion would you like? What kind of suggestion could you possibly be interested in and what would it matter?But ok, here's one for you, even if I COULD figure out what there is left to do now, I have ZERO desire to play little pvp crap. (Or I would have stayed at Haven and Hearth) Yet you take all the ore spawns and put them in PVP zones? For silly premium users to camp and attack non-premium users? so they have something to do with their item mall stuff and premium feature progression? IS that really needed on casual PVE servers?"

What bothers me the most is that it is being sold as an Ultima Online lookalike. Not even close! No dungeons, no epic locations, no towns, castles, nothing of that kind. This is a game that is totaly NOT like ultima online. The sandbox element is funish as well as frustrating as hell at the same time. I played on PVE server for the sake of exploring what can be made and even there if you do not fence yourself properly the stuff you would like to kee would simply be stolen. The progress is slow for new starters and it speeds up when you become more experienced and gather more skills. Food production plays an essential role but is for some reason made super hard for new joiners (??) so that you will be spending half of your time gathering and eating food. Talk about an overkill!Pros: Sandbox, forces you to join with others and socialize to achieve anything and preserve your position, pvp option. Also devs react fast to feedback so there might be hope.Cons: Unifinished, clunky, buggy. Recipes require massive rebalancing especially on food and farming. Clay jug and plate get spent when you eat a dish (really, one cant reuse those, one needs to live like in modern times wasting everything while resources are scarce in super tough survival world??) And false advertising needs to be included, this is nothing like UO! And for the end player population is extremly low in my view.And dont give me that ""it's alpha so you dont get the right to criticize it"" junk. They charge money for it and they need to face the feedback. When you sell a product you need to stand behind it. I didn't refund for the sake of supporting indie studios and this might become a good game. But not just now."

Not as grindy as LIF but still decent, which for me, makes it fun and worth the play. It is very detailed like PZ which I love. Seems some haters, who no longer play, are spamming the forums which initially made me second guess the purchase. I did it anyways and think it's great. Read all reviews for sure!The graphics have opportunity to be more crisp but not a show stopper. I hope the water/weather  graphics are worked on next big update since that is very bland.Combat is still being evaluated since I do PVE mostly I only fight animals.Crafting is very in-dept, and I believe the higher your stats and skill set are the more you can obtain when gathering resources as well as increase the quality/quantity.Only con so far is the lack of players online whether it is PVE or PVP. It isn't a deal breaker but would be nice to see more people.The PVE servers have a decay timer (about a week IRL). Zero server wipe system that I have seen as the decay helps with that. Overall, worth the price at $19.99 and the developers are still very involved from what I can tell."
