It's not even worth spending energy to comment on the story beyond the fact that it's extremely juvenile and cringe-worthy.This isn't even really a HOG, it's more like a point-and-click adventure game, but even then, it's extremely simple to solve the puzzles. The mini games are either obnoxiously tedious or painfully easy.The voice acting is weak; the narrator sounds like she's reading a book to young children.The writing is poorly done and some things seem to have been missed in translation (e.g. a character is constantly referred to as a soccer star, except he plays American football in the game).Not worth spending money on, in my opinion. There are better HOGs out there."

The art style was okay, the music was simple and after a while a bit annoying but I can deal with that. The voice acting was not so good but not too bad either. The story itself was silly and a bit cringy. Beacuse of this, I would say its an okay game to pass the time if you don't have anything else to do, but if you are looking for a good story, then you need to look elsewhere.However... that dog... just why? Who thought that this will be a good idea?! Why does the hint button have to be a continuously moving object with annoying sounds which cannot be muted?! This made an otherwise okay game to kill time into one of the most irritating gaming experience I ever had (well at least in HOG). I'm sorry I just can't recommend it."

I just couldn't take the squeaking and constant back and forth motion of it, it's so distracting.Otherwise, it seems like a nice game. But that thing just makes it unplayable."
,Not Recommended,500870,32680268,Posted: 23 June,all,roSquishy,"I wouldn't really recommend buying htis game, even if you are a Hidden Objects Game fan. The puzzles are simplistic and finding the objects is quite easy too. Also sometimes objects were put in such a position that the hitn dog would get in the way or you risked going to the previous screen because you would click on the back arrow instead of the object.My biggest problem with the game was the story. It's really cringe worthy.I did like that they added a map with all the locations so you could quickly travel to where you wanted to go (including a preview of the location so you knew exactly where you were going). Also it told you if you are done with that particular scene or still have something to do there."

That dog should come with its own epilepsy warning. And I used to think that Windows XP search dog was annoying ... the seizure-dog takes annoying to a whole new level."

But the story and the voice-acting are mediocre. And the puzzles are so simple that it is no fun solving them. Most of the items you need to solve the puzzle are in the same location. I'm sorry to say that I don't recommend this game to people who like fun Hidden Object Games.

The ridiculously convoluted story was was a bit more asinine than the problem solving which included strange leaps of logic like ""use the carousel to move that pile of junk."" The hints in the game were generally useless, leaving me to hunt around the screen for things to click randomly and hope that something would start to make sense soon. The only thing that kept me going was my own stubborness and a sort of sick fascination with what the writers were possibly going to do to resolve everything.Don't waste your spare change on this. Buy a cup of coffee, instead."

And this one is soooooo dumb!It's a story about evil genius, who was in love with a cheerleader, who dated football team captain, so genius gave amnesia to all town inhabitants.Gameplay is OK, graphics too, but story ruined it all.So, if you a story fan as myself, I can't recommend you this game."
76561198046065881,Not Recommended,500870,30273585,Posted: 1 March,all,Crux,"Hey Devs, I just wanted you to know what anAWESOMEdesign decision it was to put a large animation of an epileptic dog with anxiety disorder on the Hint button that moves non-stop throughout the entire game and that even when momentarily semi-sedated via said Hint button still can't be muted without muting the sound for the entire game. Brilliant!It goes with saying - and I believe I speak for nearly all of humanity that has ever even heard of video gaming and is also over the age of 3 - that such an all-peripheral-vision-consuming-continually-moving-animation has not the slightest possibility of becoming at all annoying in any way whatsoever. Personally, I dream of world where I'm able to have such an unavoidably adorable animated creature in all aspects of my life. Hey, what do think about having an animated paperclip that would pop up whenever it thought you needed help with your work applications? How cool would that be! I bet everyone would just fall in love with that forever and ever.Seriously though, I want you to know, I honestly don't remember what it was I did to you. Sometimes I just get so caught up in my own bullsh#t that I forget myself and become insensitive and rude. Just know that whatever it was I did, I realize it must have been pretty terrible for you to feel the need to so aggressively exact such a heinous revenge. And for that, I'm truly sorry.tl;dr - The near non-stop motion of the relatively large animated dog on hint button is so visually/audibly distracting and annoying it makes the game unplayable. Too bad to, because the game otherwise looked like it was going to be okay. Do not recommend."

Honestly nothing really bad about this game, it is fairly short so you won't struggle with it for days, or even an entire day but it's not unnecessarily bloated either. Interesting storyline, definitely unique and the artwork is not bad either. Fairly average point and click adventure, I enjoyed it. Overall I'd give it a 6 out of 10."
76561198077378264,Recommended,500870,30094052,Posted: 21 February,all,Sorenn,"This game takes about three hours to complete.  The main story is a bit silly but it gives you a reason to wander around a semi-abandoned town and solve puzzles.  In the translations they seem to have confused North American football with soccer.  Aside from that, I did enjoy playing this game - the art work is well executed and the music is pleasant.  There are about sixty locations and a few hundred objects to interact with.  I bought this game on sale for about two dollars - I definitely got my moneys worth from it.  The puzzles were challenging but not impossible - I did not need to use any hints to finish the story.  I did see other reviews that complained about the hint dog twitching and flashing in the bottom right corner of the screen. I didn't really notice this issue on my PC but I did play on the higher difficulty level with a large monitor.I give this game 7/10."

,Recommended,500870,32331665,Posted: 10 June,all,maxcorps,"Ok this is not a normal HOG. There are not hidden item screens. Instead all the items to be found are on the regular screens that you travel to and from. This is a unique one in my opinion. It took me just about 2 hours to complete. Must of the puzzles are very straight forward. My only complaint is whoever translated it mistook the word football for soccer. The game they are talking about is obviously american football, not international football (Soccer). Definately recommending this one."
,Recommended,500870,32886031,Posted: 27 June,all,bhcalcutta,"A different take on a hidden object game. Easy to play, with no challenging mini games.Not much TOing & FROing, and fast travel is available via the map.Story is a little obscure, but by far not the worst I've experienced.If you can't ignore it, the twitching hint dog will drive you up the wall though.Overall, a pleasant, easy to play game. I would pay full price, but definitely worth picking up in the sale80/100Replay value: 2/10time to complete 3-4 hours"
76561198084995982,Not Recommended,500870,35244331,Posted: 27 September,all,Jessica Rabbit <3,"This is a bit of a weird game.  I've played a bunch of hidden object games, some have excellent voice acting and somewhat interesting and immersive stories.  Riddles of the Past is not one of these games.  The voice acting and syncing is bizarre and offputting, but thankfully it's all over in easily under 2 hours.  The puzzles were 95% insultingly simple and 5% tedious and/or difficult to understand.  There is a lot of moving around in this game, moving from one scene to another, which I don't mind but others may find irritating.  The most annoying thing of all is that they refer to American football as soccer, when clearly the images are of a football player.  If the game is on a sale, it's not a bad way to kill two hours, but there are definitely better games in the genre out there."
,Not Recommended,500870,33693978,Posted: 21 July,all,shadree,"I can't recommend this game because the mechanics were a bit sporadic. If not for the hint system, I'd have been lost.Hotspots vary in size, objects that are necessary get ""hidden"" until later on in-game.Game logic kills one scene early on only to have a ligitimate reason presented afterwards.I enjoyed the story at least. Things seem unlikely are actually explained as part of the plot.I liked the mix of digitally painted and 3D graphics with comic book-style cutscenes.I finished it in 2 hours and the achievements are purely progress based.Get it cheap. It's definitely not the worst game I've played."

76561197994971393,Recommended,500870,26005104,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,Occupant,"A very solid P&C adventure. The hidden object aspect was well implemented. Sometimes the objects are on the same screen, sometimes they are elsewhere. But you always know what you need to pass each puzzle, so you aren't just having to blindly click on everything.Great art, and a few really good puzzles. Some of the puzzles are far too simple (easily solved just by iterating through the possibilities) and some are a bit buggy (little physics, balls falling through solid wood, et cetera), but all in all, they were enjoyable."

76561197971042250,Recommended,500870,29360966,Posted: 19 January,all,TreyNutz,"This is a fairly short HOPA game; I finished it in slightly less than 3 hrs.  Unlike many other HOPA games there aren't any typical HOPA scenes.  Instead almost every location is a bit of a HOPA puzzle where you have to find items and place them in the world to remove obstacles.  The upshot is that instead of finding objects which have nothing to do with the story, which you usually do in this genre, you are constantly finding objects which are directly tied to solving obstacles.The art work was good enough and the animations are about what you'd expect from the genre.  The only major criticism I have is the cartoon dog who gives you hints.  You can see him in the screen shots above.  He is constantly moving the entire game in a fairly fast and jerky animation.  It's not a subtle movement at all.  I found it completely distracting; so much so that I put a tissue box over that part of my monitor to block him out.  I though the dog was a truly terrible part to an otherwise fine, but short, HOPA game."

No frills and no reason to replay, but worth a once-over if it's on sale."

The hidden objects aren't very hidden, and most are used at the location in which they're found, so you don't have to do much running around. Hint: Seems that the ""!"" indicator on the map doesn't always update immediately; I don't know whether it's a time lag or some event driven thing, but I found that if I checked the map and there was no ""!"", I could make one appear by moving to an adjacent location and then checking the map again."

It does have some interesting puzzles, but most of them are fairly easy.The hardest puzzle for me wasone where you have to light up all the light bulbs.Going based off of the theory that for every dollar you spend, you should get at least one hour of gameplay, I would only reccomend buying this game when it's on sale. The only reason my playtime is almost three hours is because of going AFK a couple of times while leaving the game open.It is a good game though to get if you want to a game where you can easily 100% it with not effort really."

76561198008914127,Not Recommended,500870,34681463,Posted: 2 September,all,Wuzzerator,"Wow, this game almost sent me to sleep! If I wasn't such a perfectionist, I wouldn't have bothered playing the whole thing through.Warning, contains some *spoilers*, although the 'thrilling' nature of the story doesn't really require spoilingThe negatives:- It's so banal as to be unreal! I don't care about the protagonist, I don't care about the love interest, I don't care about the stupid town.- The story is unbelievable and insulting. So, I've lost my memory and yet after rescuing a man I haven't seen for 10 years I still want to work together with him to rebuild the town I left? I haven't got a job or a life or anything since then? The whole story revolves about the fact that the female protagonist was being fought over by two men, one of whom was an evil genius and she never even thinks to raise this as an objection?- The puzzles are so simple that all fun has been squeezed out of the game. So much relies on me finding an object in a scene and the place it belongs being highlighted almost immediately so I'm just a point, click, drop grunt for most of the game. The only pay off being able to watch an animation? Some of the puzzles you just click through by trial and error rather than stretching any sort of brain you might have left.- Why, oh why is there an orange dog as my hint???? Is it because being female, my character can only interact with children's toys? Perhaps it's because I skipped the tutorial, perhaps the startling plot revelations about this plastic monstrosity were filled in during some epic plot-twist. Or perhaps it's because the developers think all women like children's toys, marriage and puppies.The positives:- It looks nice in a cutesy, twee sort of way. And they must have spent some time on it.- It gave me a break from shooting zombies / created a calm space after playing the horrors of 'I have no mouth and I must scream' which may require a lifetime of therapy to recover from.- It's so easy, I'll probably be able to play it after a lobotomy.- If you're a concerned parent who just wants an almost completely harmless (gender stereotypes aside) game for your 6-9 year old to play, then it's probably ok on sale."
