,Recommended,501110,25205973,"Posted: 28 August, 2016",all,Michelangelo,"Been playing it using HTC VIVE and it is pure fun!!GAMEPLAY!!!You have 2 lines to choose for each DropPoint, and each line can be passed using the red rings (bigger) and the yellow rings (smaller). Yellow rings will provide the ""Perfection"" objetives and will grant more points that the basic ones.Some of those lines are really original and crazy ones!! like passing under bridges, holes, giant donuts, avoiding trees and many other surprises...Besides that the creative part are the added bonuses and hidden things. Those make you think..hmmm can I pass over there? let's see!! and that is where the wacky things will happen.And that's not all, let me tell you that I found the RECORD THE PRO MODE, incredible!!You have to follow another PRO Wingsuit like if you were recording it....without going to far to loose him or pass it to miss the record.And you have another SURVIVAL MODE where you cannot see things at least when they are too close...and there is too much wind...really hard and creative.UPDATE 12/09/2016:Let me tell you that I keep finding several hidden surprises and really great ways to fly over the same droppoints and that is why I cannot stop playing.Sometimes I just fly for the pure pleasure of trying crazy things.Really the game has a long life and long replay value.So far you will have 20 DropPoints in the game to unlock gradually.Each DropPoint will provde you 2 main Line Courses (with normal and perfection level on each), then you will have also the RECORD THE PRO MODE and the SURVIVAL MODE on each too and also several minor objetives, and 3 basic SCORE objetives too.Survival Mode is another way to play, when you enable it, the weather will change completly, you won´t see so far because of dense fog, and the wind conditions are really strong. In that way, you have to reach the end safely...and is going to be reaaally difficult and exciting to play. Love the Idea....I think it was an original approach.GREAT GAMEPLAY!! 9/10Here is one example video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAaNjLIM6KACONTROLS:You can control the Wingsuit direction with your head!!!I enabled that option and it works good, and I mean that sometimes if you watch to much to your R/L you are going to screw your flying :P Besides that you use the gamepad and is not difficult to start but it has a normal learning curve to start creating wild maneuvers and flips in the air...the result in VR is....WOOOOOOOOOOOOW.However, I do agree that if developers may add optional VIVE controllers support to simulate the hands it could be amazing if they pull the right control scheme.7/10VR EXPERIENCE:Initially I thought it was not as extreme...but after playing more and more, I realized that the initial Wingsuits maybe are slows to give the player an easy introduction.Later as you gradually unlock new Wingsuits the game starts to push your boundaries and the speed gets really intense. Also you will start trying so much crazy thing that the VR EXPERIENCE will make you mad at some narrow points or stunts.Cardiac Experience: 8.5/10---------------------------------OVERALL SCORE: 8.5/10Can't stop playing it-----------------------------------Additional notes(for all those who want details)PERFORMANCE: I've enabled all details to ""Very High"" and 2xAA with RenderTarget set to 1.2. I'm using and I7 + 980ti + 16gb Ram on Windows 10 and it plays PERFECT. If I raise RenderTarget to 1.3...I can see a very little stuttering if I turn my head (something you don't want in these games at all)There is certain room for Improvements here... I'm asking the developers to improve the DEATHS of the character because there is so much fun here (Dark souls players...come here!!! you will enjoy this game too :P), 3rd person view, VIVE CONTROLLERS support, etc. But the game today at 1.0, works as advertised correctly.0 Motion Sickness from my side....and I'm doing crazy turns out there ...ohhh yeah.BONUS: Some special moments in the game:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z8T6MLGQqk"

Seems like an odd statement given some of the games out, but I was hooked for three hours straight the first time I booted it up. Addictive like a lot of the snowboarding and skating games that were great on consoles, tons of challenges and a steady progression of unlocks. It never feels grindy, but is definitely challenging. The Vive controllers work extremely well once you get a feel for it (be sure to check out the controls/mapping in options).I'm not prone to motion/VR sickness, so I won't be much help on that front, but they do have a ""stomach"" mode that is supposed to help folks with that problem. The sense of speed, height and trajectory are all great. After an hour or so it begins to feel natural and you're bending through the air.The environment/world is great. The mountains, lines, challenges and atmosphere are all great. There are 20 total bases to unlock and jump from, and each one exposes a new part of the world, a unique area that looked like it may have just been background scenery in earlier jumps.This is a sleeper hit, if you have even a passing interest in wingsuits, smacking into things going 175 mph or jumping off of tall objects...it gets a solid recommendation."

This one has a learning curve to it, especially if you're using the Vive controllers.  Expect to spend your first thirty minutes or so smashing into cliffs and trying to make sense of what the hell is going on.  The controls need a very subtle touch, and figuring out exactly how to hold them is a bit of a trial-and-error process right now.Do NOT give up.  Once it ""clicks"" it is amazing.  I have no idea what ""real"" wingsuit flying is like, but this feels spectacular.  I found myself frequently holding my breath during close-shave passes with cliffsides and narrow gaps.  Going from my first fumbling attempts at flight to screaming through concrete pipes at high speed without fear feels amazing.  I've only explored the first two drop sites, and I'm already hooked."

One round, I'll have about a 30 degree difference between going up and going down, which is normal. You'd usually see a someone using a wingsuit have his arms around his thighs or so like that.Then there are the random times, mid flight mind you, where my controls will suddenly require me to swing my arms almost 180 degrees to change from up to down or vice versa, and it's really annoying during my attempts at perfect runs, basically making them entirely impossible."

Do not rage quit and ask for a refund, that just means that you a) haven't logged enough time with the Vive and/or b) you haven't spent enough time getting a feel for this game -- practice more before you miss out on this game!!!3. Bravo to the devs for making the controls so intuitive -- once you get it, you will get it. Like those wierd ""3D"" posters from (ahem) 25 years ago...4. For Noobs -- I have found that sitting in my chair, resting my elbows on my knees as a starting position works well, and use your wrists for most motion. It is about feel, and VERY important to look ahead (like a race car driver looks ahead into the furthest turn they can see, your body will react intuitively as long as you LOOK where you WANT to go.

For a Vive game that means something.It's like Tony Hawk Pro Skater, but on a giant mountain with a wingsuit. Not onlly is this the most fun game I've played on the vive, but it's getting me my VR legs. I just got the vive recently and don't experience much sickness, though my first drop in No Limits 2 (rollercoaster sim) I Imediately felt it bad and had to rip off the headset.My first drop in this game I didn't feel it while playing too badly at all, but I felt some adrenaline and fear. When I took the headset off though I was a little nausious for a good hour or two. Since then I have played it in increased amounts of time every day, because it is soo fun, and I am happy to say that after my last 90 minute session I experienced NO nausia.And I still scream like a girl when I try to do a back flip and end up flying backwards into the mountain to my death.If you are new to vive start sitting down and do a drop or two until you feel no neusia. For those with VR legs I suggest playing it standing up, and turning down the in game music and putting on spottify or pandora instead. Standing up with my favorite tunes on makes this game super immersive and great with so much potential for replayability. I'm only on drop 45of like 20, and I've completed maybe 12 objectives out of hundreds. Great VR game with lots of content. Don't miss this. (Game supports Vive Controllers.)10/10"

The controls didn't feel super responsive, and maybe I didn't find the setting, but I basically had to look straight up to play the game. I felt like I should have known it wasn't going to impress me. It wasn't a comfortable experience.Also, when I turned the in game resolution scaling up (the slider for which was buggy), it started flickering black so I could hardly see or turn it back down.I returned it after getting it on sale for $10."
,Recommended,501110,34510264,Posted: 26 August,all,FastLawyer,"Played on Oculus Rift with Touch.  Honestly, this is a fun and challenging game.  And there's a surprising amount of content here, believe it or not.  There's several drop points, each with different paths, which means there's many jumps/vistas to do and scores to chase.  Granted, I haven't been able to get past the second drop point after playing for 30 minutes.The main things I don't like about this game are the controls and the lack of a good tutorial.  Also, the difficulty spike is quite large between the first drop zone and the second drop zone.  The graphics are good, but not great.  And for whatever reason, I didn' feel fully immersed when flying.I think part of the reason is because you have to look down or up to control your flight up and down horizontally, meanwhile you're standing up vertically (you can also do seated, but bleh on that).  Also you neck will start feeling some strain after a while with the current setup.  Why couldn't gliding up or down have been controlled using the motion controllers?  Easy solution is to make a slight twist of the wrists for up or down (like an eagle would use it wings or plane using its flaps).  That way you can look around wherever you want free from the motion.  You're already using your arms to control side movements.Still, I enjoyed playing this game.  I think it's fun if you can ignore the above issues.  Just wish the above issues were fixed so that more time could be spent enjoying the game versus being frustrated.  Also it would be nice if there was a relaxed, ""guided"" option, meaning much easier jumps to just enjoy the views and feeling of flight with no score.Rating 7/10"

This is everything I wanted in a VR simulation. I set a fan in front of me and I'm good to go. Plenty of things to do, lots to exp[lore, and upgraded wing suits to unlock.  Great sounds, look and feel to the game playing on HTC Vive and standing, I have my VR legs and love scary rides in RL so this didn't bother me one bit, what a great feeling of flight. Didn't take long for me to get control, but is challenging enough with gaps and tunnels, etc. to aim/search for. I can see many hours of gameplay with this title, I've had it on my wish list for a little while and was able to grab it on sale for there 1 year anniversary and I am not dissapointed, would have easily paid full price earlier if I had known it was really this much fun, 2D Youtube videos of most VR games never really do them too much justice because it is hard to try and picture what it is like in VR  until you try it. Just get this game if you ever wanted to soar like a flying squirel down some mountainside cliffs and such, and you have the stomach for it :P Get this game now!PS. to the developers: It would be cool to be able to change the color of your smoke, just a thought, or perhaps even different types of ""trails"", like fire, or snow, etc. :)"

I keep coming back to cross the next goal on the list which eventually unlocks new goodies. It has a bit of a goofy Tony Hawk Pro Skater feel to it which is welcome. Graphics run smoothly on max settings on my GTX980. I prefer sitting upright in front of a fan set on high and turning off all comfort settings. A must have on every VR gamer's library.

Hugging the grouns while flying at high speed gives a good sense of actually flying.  So far I'm completely immune to VR sickness in every game I've tried, but flying down hill and popping up quickly to just barely clear a ridgeline gives a thrill almost like riding a roller coaster.Speaking of VR sickness, beware that is can definitely be a thing for some people.  My wife played (against my advice) and made herself feel pretty ill after flying at low altitude, but to be fair she also got sick after playing Euro Truck Simulator and driving (literally) about 10 feet.If you don't suffer from motion sickness and own a gamepad, this is a must-buy."

The controls give a nice feeling of just enough control and feel as realistic as I would imagine the amount of control you would have falling at 100mph with a tiny surface area of cloth making you glide. The objectives are fun, varied and sometimes frustrating - but may require a revisit once I unlock better wing suits. The game has a 'pilotwings' vibe to it.There are 20 different decents down the same mountain range, with two main courses on each decent with a 16 total objectives per decent, offering freedom of what you complete and how you open up the next decent or wingsuit. The game feels like it has nicely paced progression and will take a lot of practice and work to complete every challenge. I play it on Rift and it works fine at default settings on my r9 290."

Unfortunately, the controls are extremely inconsistant.  I understand how to reset after every flight and mid flight, and steering with the headset + controllers is actually pretty intuitive.  However, about once every two runs, the view rotates by about 30 degrees (even though I haven't moved my head) and I begin flying down in a spiral, and nothing I can do stops it until I crash into a bloddy mess.  Also I have found the parachute extremely unreliable, pressing the button far in advance doesn't release it causing me to lose the run.I really like the idea of this game and would happily buy it if the controls were fixed, but for now I'm returning it."
