,Recommended,501120,24434421,"Posted: 20 July, 2016",all,Monty Bojangles,"I bought Clock Simulator with some trepidation, as I hadn't seen a trailer or an E3 demo or a preview from IGN. At £0.79 at the time of purchase, this is not a cheap game; however, owing to the 15 or so previous positive reviews I decided to take the plunge and give Clock Simulator a go.The game was around 250mbs in size - quite beefy, I thought, as it took around 80 seconds to download on my broadband connection. However installation was relatively quick and painfree. I was slightly dismayed when, as I opened up the game for the first time, it appeared on the second of my two monitors - the one I don't play games on. I made my way quickish to the options screen and unchecked ""fullscreen"", believing I would need to keep it in windowed mode to transfer to my primary monitor. However, on closer inspection, I found a dedicated monitor select option, which pleased me greatly. I made sure the settings were set to high quality, despite being unsure how my computer would handle the game as I did not know the technical specifications. I then proceeded to the tutorial.The tutorial is clear, concise and well presented. It is a well balanced mixture of text based instruction and manual practice. The visual guides worked well. It was perhaps lacking somewhat in depth, but I assume depth is a small sacrifice for the minimalistic presentation of the game. Once I had become well versed with the games principle concepts via the tutorial, I proceeded to try the first game mode.Clock Simulator is focused on providing the experience of being a clock. By clicking or pressing space at 1 second intervals, you become a clock. The game works well to emulate the precise timing of 1 second, and uses visual cues or likewise to notify you when you are out of sync with said timing. The visuals are minimalistic but effective and artful. My computer handled the performance of the game adequately; my concerns about not meeting the technical specifications were unfounded. Some edges were jarringly sharp, and at times I lamented at the lack of graphical depth owing to the minimalistic approach but on the whole, the graphical performance and art style are constructed well.The gameplay is deceptively simple but very rewarding. There are many nuances to consistently clicking at 1 second intervals. The difficulty varies within the different game modes, but with practice, nothing is unbeatable. To maintain clicking frequency with perfect timing is a challenging but wholly satisfying experience.The plot/story/character aspect of the game once again reflects the overall minimalistic approach; but much can be inferred from the details provided if looked upon closely enough. The very sparse but deliberate use of text is rich with illicit poetry. Character development is done through the player - by becoming the clock, you ARE the protagonist. Unlike most other games that have you play the protagonist as an extended avatar, this game succeeds in blending the distinction between player and character. In my 0.1 hours of playtime, I managed to feel a subtle yet effortless connection with my clock self. By extension, I now further appreciate the function of time keeping in my daily life, and the technical artistry of the clock.The sound design is rich and textured. The musical undertones are perfectly composed for the games presentation and artstyle. It aided extensively in setting the appropriate mood to enable me to immerse fully in being a clock. There is occasional slightly excessive loudness in certain aspects of the score, but this is remedied by altering the volume settings and spending some time to achieve the right balance of volume for yourself.The technical performance of the game is stellar. In my 0.1 hours of playtime, I have encountered no noticeable bugs or glitches. I have had no crashes, lag or framerate drops. As of this review, I would be confident in stating that this game sets the standard for technical quality in modern game production.On the whole, Clock Simulator is a deceptively minimal, rich and extremely rewarding gaming experience. The balance of presentation, gameplay and art is almost perfectly maintained. It manages to succeed in simulating the experience of being a clock, to a point where it is almost a disservice to call it a simulation. You ARE the clock.I fully expect this game to become a sleeper hit; my principle concern perhaps being the steep price at the time of review. I would absolutely recommend this as a purchase within a Steam sale - at a discount, this game is undeniably a must have. I look forward to spending more time on Clock Simulator, and look forward more so to a potential follow up or DLC.I give Clock Simulator a 9.4/10."

[EDIT: Has been rectified.]But that only means even more minigames will be added in the future, and it's a bargain price even for such a small game!"

Seriously, not many video games give me this type of pain, when I should be getting pleasure from this game. Maybe it's making me question my thoughts of what a video game can do. Maybe counting time to a sync is painful cause I want an intangible objective to fufill my dreams of being a castle builder, a dragonslayer, or eat mushrooms out of hitting a block with my head.Whatever the case, you'll get real mental stress out of counting real time before your eyes than pressing A on your controller for a limit break."

This is mainly about controlling and moving the hand of a clock - one press at a time.You have a list of game modes here with some minor differences. All with their own distinct (yet simplistic) background, colouring and ambient music. And while the different modes also mean different difficulties they all have one thing in common: a sense of rhythm you need in order to survive.It's a short, simplistic game which represents a great pastime! Kudos to those who can obtain the ""10 perfect taps in a row"" achievement. The guys at Kool2Play know how to be creative - keep up the good work!"

,Recommended,501120,24451650,"Posted: 21 July, 2016",all,Rezzy,"A very fun, very simple game, though I doubt it perfectly tracks a second. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, hard to say. Disregarding that, it's definitely accurate ENOUGH to be enjoyable.Basically, you have a bunch of mini-games, each (well, most) revolving around one thing - clicking once a second. The variations aren't too different from each other, but even playing just one or two of them is fun. The game does list your high scores and some other stats for each game mode, so you can, to some extent at least, track how much better you are getting as a clock.Some things I'd love to see would be seeing more stats in the initial results screen of every match. At the moment, it only tells you your score (or the time you survived), while it could tell you your longest streak (combo) of great hits, and the total amount of perfect hits out of all hits. It tracks and shows them elsewhere, so I don't see any reason for the game not to show them where it matters most.All in all, for it's incredibly low price, it's definitely worth a try. I personally felt that my inner clock is almost perfect (which gave me the 'Get a total of 10 perfect taps in one game' during my first 15 taps or so), but it took quite some time to get 10 in row for the hardest achievement.Solid, simple, cheap game. It's not even ugly! Except for the font in tutorial. Ugh, that was horrible. The pig was cute though."

For example, there is an achievement for playing for 5 consecutive minutes. There are gamemodes like the QWOP gamemode (where for each second instead of clicking with your mouse or pressing spacebar, it is replaced by pressing either Q, W, O, or P) that DO NOT count towards this achievemnt. This is arguably because in some gamemodes the seconds are easier to click than others (I guess), but that's a load of♥♥♥♥♥♥ 0/10 QWOP is hated as a game and as a gamemode now :/"

Nice user interface. Many fun game modes to take you through all forms of time keeping. Perfect for timelords, clock afficianados and grandfather clocks.Great if you wake up everyday wishing you were a clock. Definitely recommended for those who hear the perfect 60bpm tick of a clock in their sleep cycle. I rate this 1,000ms.Become the clock you were destined to be!"

The further you can last, the better. There are variety of gamemodes and I hope developer keeps adding them.It's a good time killer but I also believe it helps you to build concentration. Because of that, I can really recommend this game because of it's cheap price."
