76561198027357949,Recommended,501190,24609817,"Posted: 30 July, 2016",all,Letalis13,"Oh where to begin...Up front:  The Pros here are outnumbered by the cons.  Do not buy unless you understand two things.1.  This is not anywhere near as good as Madden was well over a decade ago.2.  You're not paying for a superior football simulation so much as helping a (tiny!) developer create an alternative to EA.Pros:-Decent number of mod options apparently available.  None used so far, just the game ""out of the box.""-Franchise mode! For when you're in it for the long haul.-Quick Play mode...for when you want a...quickie.-Passing game control using mouse is easy/intuitive and innovative. Allows you to put the ball where you want.-Good audible and hot route system, but no option to simply flip play direction at the line of scrimmage.-32 teams to choose from...wonder how they arrived at that number...Bugs/Cons/Gripes:Complaints and negative generally fall into the three categories below:  gameplay, graphics and sound.Gameplay:-No sense of physical inertia in the game at all.  When there is a collision, players simply fall down at the point of contact.-No substitutes.  The players on the field are who you have, period.-No injuries-No fake punts or fake field goals-There is only a small difference between how a lineman looks and handles on defense versus a defensive back.-No defensive audibles.-No real options/special moves available if playing as a defensive lineman...or any defensive player for that matter.-No instant replay or option to record matches.-In a game with 10 minute quarters there was a grand total of ONE broken tackle.  Spins and jukes are basically useless.-Announcer is bland, repetitive and sounds like he is referring to powder puff football.-Quarterbacks can throw the ball 95 yards in the air.-Scale of field to players is off.  Field feels like it is 30 yards wide, not 43 and change.-Far too many dropped passes.-Zero receiver animation in some cases, the ball simply bounces off a guy with arms at his sides.-In first (only) game played, my QB had over 40yds rushing...but had no rushing stats.-NO PLAY CLOCK.  What time is it?  Tea time you say?  I'll leave my boys at the line of scrimmage for a half hour then!-Game clock only moves 10 seconds at a time after a play.  My team had 130 plays in a 40 minute game.-Zero indication of when a quarter has come to an end other than looking at the clock.-No wind or wind indications, even in the kicking game.-Kicking and punting controls make it much easier to kick to the right than to the left.-TINY PLAYBOOKs.  All teams have same playbook with a total of up to 8 plays for each of the half dozen formations.-On punts, kickoffs and incomplete passes, THE BALL DOES NOT BOUNCE when it hits the ground!?!  (#VelcroBowl2016)Graphics:-Wideout animations are odd before the snap and freeze to the point they don't look alive till the snap occurs.-Runner animations have a very high center of gravity and wierd arm movements.  (Special Olympics, is that you?)-Quarterback animation upon dropping back is same goofy one from Axis '15.  Zero NFL QBs act/look like they're chilling at the disco. Once you notice, you can't un-notice.-Crowd sprites would not be awful if they had more than two colors and weren't in the shape of the stadium seats!-1920x1080 resolution looks like 1024x720Sound:-Announcer bland, repetitive and annoying.  Zero references to team, field position, player name.-After playing one game, started a second but quit out of annoyance because of a wierd persistent ringing tone.Closing Thoughts:I played a quick match to generate this review and quit during the second quick match because of a game bug.  Despite the fact I won that first game 43-42 in overtime on pro difficulty, there were far too many shortcomings for it to be a satisfying gaming experience.  I love playing football in real life, watching football on TV, playing football on consoles.  I want to like playing football on the PC.  Axis Football 2016 as a competitor to EA just is not there yet.  We're not talking not in the same league, zip code, area code, state...no my friend, that would be too kind. We're talking in terms of a pseudo third-world video game in comparison virtually across the board here.  This is the kind of game that cohabitates the abstract space occupied by AK-47s and angry black people shooting other angry black people.  This game had to learn DirkaDirka on the same streets as the neighborhood suicide bomber before it came across the border into the US, got on to Steam without a photo ID and voted 3,000 times in Florida and Idaho as an undocumented democrat.  (I can't resist, it's an election year)The feature set that is in place is decent enough, but the core gameplay itself is so unengaging and flawed that I would have to force myself through a season, and that's something I've never had to do going all the way back to the age of Tecmo.  With ALL that said, I hate EA.  I hate EA enough to shave my chest hair and eat it if they would simply stop being EA.  I hate EA enough to give this tiny developer a thumbs up despite the fact their game probably doesn't deserve it.  The effort put forth here IS somewhat praiseworthy for all the negatives.  Football is not simple to simulate as compared to say, golf, and EA has had large, well-funded teams refine their product over many years.  I want to support an alternative to EA very badly, but I also need to write a review that gives prospective buyers an idea of what they are purchasing.  Do I regret paying $20 for this game?  Kinda.  If it were just the game, oh my yes.  If it were just the game itself being judged, it is worth 5-10 bucks in my book.  But you're not just buying a game, you're buying hope for the little man and hope for a rebirth of football on the PC that isn't run by the cash-grabbing *BLEEEEEP* at EA.  All that said, odds are you're gonna want something better too, even with the lowered expectations from this review - you have been warned.In the end, (<-that's this part of the review->) I give Axis 2016 only a 5 out of 10 but a thumbs up for heading in the right direction...that and not being EA."
,Recommended,501190,24663450,"Posted: 1 August, 2016",all,The Crazy Monk,"I want to start off my review by saying simply, you CAN get the regular NFL uniforms and current roster as a mod and this is the link (so you don't go digging around like I did):http://axisgames.proboards.com/thread/35/nfl-experience-2016-mod-availableInstallation is simple, a video is provided even if you can't figure it out. Now time for the review.Pros:-A Madden alternative-Developers and a few modders display commitment towards creating a good Madden alt that attempts to excell where the current game does not.-The QB throwing dynamic is amazing. Not only do you have to find the open receiver, you have to aim correctly. It's more difficult but more rewarding as it feels realistic.-Kicking is not as easy and it feels great. You have to balance your power with accuracy, where in Madden of course you just kick it as hard as you can in the direction you desire.-There is potential for some awesome mods support, but it is currently lacking. As stated before you can mod the uniforms, team name, and roster. I think you can also edit the audible sound clips and the hot routes, and maybe more. I would really love the ability to add the correct schedule for our team as I want to play according to the actual NFL schedule. I'm sure graphics and animation mods would help too. Also individual adjustments to each QB voice would be VERY useful for modders. I would love hearing the actual voice of the NFL QBs as audibles are called.Cons:-Not as many options as Madden-Defense feels bland to play on-Animations and graphics are obviously well below Madden's but you really can't complain given the circumstances.-Mod support is not quite there yet.-No ability (as far as I am aware) to modify the schedule which this game needs IMO-Franchise mode is underwhelming. Needs more options and adjustments.Overall I recommend it for the QB/K play but mostly its potential. I'm not going to lie, I probably will continue to play far more Madden than Axis. However I think we really need some alternative so for that reason I will not request a refund in order to support the developers. If this game can achieve what it set out to do originally, I think it will thrive.To the developers please focus on Franchise mode a bit more for us that don't want to play multiplayer, this is one of the ways this game can really outshine Madden. Also consider some fun game modification settings for multiplayer like gravity adjustment, speed, slow-mo, etc. You should try and do everything that madden does not. Give this game some flavor that catches people's attention. Being on the PC is a huge plus, but not enough. I'm sure I speak for the rest of us when I say that I want this game to thrive. I don't want to spend $60 a year on what is essentially the same game with an updated roster and schedule. Give me a game that I can mod and update on my own, and release sequels every few years to upgrade graphics and mechanics... etc. Good luck and thank you!"

The moddable teams2. The constant support from Danny3. Addictive gameplay4. The modest price tag for what you get within the gameCons that are here during launch day (most will be fixed by the first or second patch) include:1.

I don't regret the purchase and recommend this to anyone who prefers PC gaming ot console gaming.The passing mechanics are unique and a little annoying at first but with practice you should get better. Runnning the ball becomes much more difficult the bigger a lead you have and your O-line tends to disengage blocks sooner when you're ahead. Playing on defense is a little bland due to a lack of abilities and diversity when it comes to how players handle, and your D-lineman gnereally move too slow to sack any QB. I've had fun with this game thus far but can't imagine I'm going to invest as many hours as I have already in the first week in the future.If you want a football game on your PC and don't like EA then please support this small developer."

I still own 2K5 which is still the best football game ever made. I own ps 4 and xbox one but I refuse to support madden anymore. Sixty dollars every year for a game which is still the same. The money means nothing, but the product is still behind 2k5. Where is the halftime studio, where is the score updates of other teams during the game when your in franchise mode, coin toss is gone. Where is the ability to relocate your team as in the past. Or create stadium, set prices on the merchadise for your franchise. Madden to me has gone backwards and is becoming almost a joke. Yeah the graphics are good but the overall progress of the game is just about putting out a product for money. Axis 16 has alot of work to do, but i like what they did. Its a step in the right direction and i will continue to support this product as long as i see progress to become a game that can finally give EA some competition. This is a good game. Is it the best no, not by a long shot. But its worth 20 bucks especially you can mod the roster which was brillant by the way. I want to see EA have someone to remind them of how to put quality games together."

You'll run the ball and have a hole and suddenly a defender magically slides in front of you from across the field🏈 Sound design is poor. I run an additional loop track of crowd noise in the background as well as music to beef it up and turn the less than stellar announcer down a bit.🏈 No play clock and the time mechanics in general are off.🏈 The kicking mechanics are almost arbitrary. I have played games now where even the AI couldn't pick up the extra point after a touchdown for the entire game.So Why Play?:🏈 It's fun!🏈 Mod support🏈 I want to play football on my PC🏈 Xbox One controller works great🏈 Despite my criticisms, I like what the developer is doing and want to see them continue to build and refineBetween the NFL mod that I DL from the mod forums and the doctoring I've done to get more robust crowd noise and music into the game, it feels reasonably close to NFL football.

It has okay graphics which makes it easy to run, the modding is great and allows a lot of customization, and above all else the game is very fun to play. The controls and aimed passing add a funn and original expirience. However, the Franchise mode is a pretty bare, and there is no coin toss, or penalties. These along with no player celebrations or in game stats take away from the overall immersion. Nevertheless it is still a good game and for $20 I highly recommend it."

It's early, but it seems the game will really grow and become better. It's a little bare bones for now, but it's a great start. I like the passing to a spot via mouse, makes you think about your throws more. Was not hard to learn, if you played madden you'll be up to Hall of Fame mode quickly. It was also easy to find mods to put in other teams etc. Wish I had known about the Kickstarter for this.

It's definitely a work in progress and at least according to reviews where people have commented that there's been a steady improvement year to year, that sounds like a good sign. It's definitely a decent football game for PC, especially since Madden withdrew from the market after 2008. It definitely needs some refinement. For the developers, I'd humbly ask that they do not add all the bloat and clunkyness that came with the Madden games over the years. I'm not sure if this game is worth $20, but if they add a lot of QoL fixes(punt return awkwardness, controls menu in options, etc), it could be.I recommend this game only if you absolutely crave a football game on PC that isn't Madden 2008.

I no longer a hardcore football gamer, but I still enjoy playing from time to time. I was interested in an alternative to Madden that features lots of modability, so I decided to invest in Axis Football.The game still has a way to go to be comparable to even last gen football games, though it does play a reasonably fun game of football. If you're buying this game, you have to think of it as an investment in future versions where the developer is promising to bring in more features you'd expect in a current gen football game.My only concerns is that for a game that is supposed to be very mod friendly, the modding community is nearly dead. The only available mods, NFL and NCAA rosters, were released when the game came out, but there has been next to nothing since. That's definitely been the most disappointing aspect to me. Also, the amount of news on updates from the developer has seemed to dry up as well, which makes me nervous that he has already stopped supporting this version to work on next year's.I'm giving it a recommend because the bones are there for a good football game. Hopefully, a few more updates add in things like substitutions and more audio modding options and then next year we'll see a more robust game."

That being said, I think that, for the price, Axis Football 2016 probably isn't worth the money. I love having a football simulation game on my Mac that spoofs the NFL, and it's a great way to keep myself entertained for a while when I have nothing else to do, but I feel like the quality of this game—e.g. the graphics, the gameplay, the interface—is akin to that of the old NCAA Football 11 app for the iPhone, which came out in 2010...I spent $4.99 on that game. It's overly simplistic, the graphics are poor, the mechanics are both bizarre and confusing, and there aren't a ton of unique features. In a sense, it's a glorified flash game.Again, it's my fault for expecting the complexities of a $60 console game to show up in a 1.3 GB $20 computer game, so keep that in mind when factoring this review into your decision-making process. I bought it on sale, so I don't regret spending $10 on boredom therapy, but if you're looking for a solid, deeper game with your $20 bill, this probably isn't for you.Also, if you do decide to get the game, it's far better with a Steam controller, especially if you play Madden NFL or NCAA Football."

If I'm overlooking something let me know.  And what's that big mess of a franchise home screen?  It's every team listed with their records.  Where are the divisions?  The conferences?   Those are the aspects that make a sports game (especially football) seem like a league.  Chasing records, winning championships, and drafting.  That's football.

,Recommended,501190,24760631,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,LostATLien,"The Axis Football series is something football gamers have needed for a long time, and the possibilities are endless.The passing mechanic alone makes this game addicting. There's nothing quite like putting the ball exactly where you want it to try and lead your receiver for 6.The mod control is very good, and it is only going to get deeper and deeper as time goes by.The real hero for the game is the developer, Danny Jugan. He LISTENS to the community and adds their requests into updates (mine made it into v2.0) . He truly wants the best football game for this community, and unfortunately we don't get that elsewhere *cough cough*Yes as of right now there is not much in the game, but if you look at the leaps from Axis 15 to Axis 16, one could understand why most are excited for this game's future.Purchase this game to have fun with the franchise mode, quick play, coach mode, or even just to make every classic team you can. Most importantly, remember with every purchase of Axis, all the the funds go towards making the game the best it can be.I for one can't wait for the future of Axis"

Im glad I bought this game because I really enjoy it.  All the hard work and time that has been put into this game has paid off.  I don't own an xbox or ps4.  My gaming is done on my PC.  Aftermarket Controller works just fine with Axis.  Can't wait for 2017 to be released.  But in the mean time 2016 runs like a Super Bowl Champion!  The NFL Mod loads very nicely.  Even a novice could Delete, Copy and paste the NFL rosters in to the Mod Folder...  You can also add any music you want to the Menu by dropping a .wav or .ogg file right into the folder.  Not to mention you could even add your own play by play calling voice (I actually bought myself a nice mic for recording to do it)!!! Add to all that, you can edit the stadiums if you have a program like Corel Draw X7.  I totally redid the Billboard with NFL, NFC and AFC Logo's. HAHAHA!! Thank you! Thank you guys! Keep up the awesome work guys!!!!"

I was really expecting to love this.But it just... isn't fun. It doesn't have the same charm as the flash version. It plays identical as the over-head view yet tries to hamfist those mechanics into 3rd person and the result is terrible. You can forgive a lack of jukes/sprinting/etc when it's overhead, but when it goes third person like this, it just looks and feels terrible. There's practically nothing to do on defense but watch.Whereas the flash game was unique, this is literally a worse Madden. You would be better off downloading Madden 2008 and playing that. Real shame, I love the flash game but this just feels *nothing* like it unfortunately.If the game was 5$, I could see keeping this. But at nearly $20, I requested a refund."

You can't build your team in franchise mode w/o a draft or free agency, instead you just play the same roster repeatedly.  In summary, it's not ready for primetime or to have people play it but I imagine that there are enough people desperate for an American football game that they'll give it a try like me."

The gameplay has kind of a late 90s feel to it, along with a comparable AI.  Despite frequent mentions of franchise mode, you have 0 control over your franchise.  There are no substitutions, trades, free agency, draft...any of the things one would want from a franchise mode.  What sucks is that franchise mode is currently what I like least about Madden, so I would expect a competitor to offer something there.I've yet to master the passing mechanic, which I did find intriguing, but given the graphics and in-game physics, really hard to adjust to.  I ended up requesting a refund, as I felt the advertisement of a franchise mode was very misleading."

I love football and I repect the intrevention of a defensive back on running back and definately watching the timing of a corner back against a reciever. This game doesn't capture the FP interaction with any position. On offense as a QB you have to throw at a circle on the ground and pray your recievers open which most of the time you wont be able to see them to tell.  The Defense side of the ball relies on total randomness on a passing play the dime set works on one  down but on the same play fails miserably.  Special teams gives you a Horriable on screen kick meter-if anyone misses four or five point after kicks,  Hey I'am  sorry that player's off my Team.  I will say that the amount play selection is great but theres only two views available to watch them unfold.  The controller should be able to control the game not the game controlling the controler.I've been playing Madden ever since it first came out so would someone please tell me why no other developers can come close to EA's quality-has there been some payoffs or something-I mean really look How far Soccer games have come and BasketBall-yes even BaseBall has progressed but FootBall remains in the financial hands of Corporates that charge an arm and a leg for their products. Its a perfect example of  capitalism Though. As far as this game its got no replay value and Seriously theres no replay option either.  One day a realistic football game will come- but it'll probably be in VR. Go Figure. Scale 5/10. By The way I'd like to plug Steam incrediable System guys please keep it up. Thank You !!"

If Axis 2015 was a 5/10 game, I'd rate this a 6/10. Better but nothing that significant, and some things made worse. Dissappointing game.Cons:- franchise mode; can't change teams.- minimum game length is 20 min. WAY too long for me. 2015 games could be played in 10 min.- no wind indicators.- Spin and juke; kind of worthless. Don't expect a lot of broken tackles.- Can't rotate camera angle (no playable side or broadcast angle).- Selected team in franchise mode doesn't HIGHLIGHT in the stats screens.- Modding is basically for the graphic artist gamers. No in-game modding at all. WOuld've been nice to customize my own league of teams in this game, using in-game options/editors. But instead, the Axis ""modding"" concept is all about hacking the game.Pros:- better team graphics (with the mods made available by other people).- zoomable camera and raise it up and down.- play multiple seasons and track career stats in franchise mode."
