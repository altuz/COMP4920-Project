76561197970641866,Not Recommended,501320,34026365,Posted: 4 August,all,Quinox,"I find this game a bit shallow, at the very least at this point on release. Basically you have several meters all running down based on who you choose during the three turns / months per season. The game is fundamentally one very similar to concentration, with villager virtue / vice instead of number / icon matching cards.Layered on top of that though is two states of unknown, the first is where you haven't seen a virture or vice, and the second when you know which meter the virtue or vice affects. Kind of like learning what suite a card belongs to in a memory game, then next time learning what the number of that card actually is.The various kinds of virtue and vice are cosmetic really, primarily there are three increments of value per virtue or vice, with the greatest value having the most impact. Which is to say for virtues they are the best villager for increasing the related meter, and for vices they are one of your specific 9 traitors.It's got more kinship to the game Werewolf in that aspect, as each villager is rather like a role card and there are traitors in your midst to be killed off each turn / season. They're just targets though, sitting there to be killed. Granted if you actively used them before realizing who they are, then you've been draining your meters at a much, much faster rate than normal.It doesn't really sound all that uninteresting, except guesswork is punished in this game. If you can't point and show that a traitor is obviously a traitor then the family house they come from becomes especially irate, draining the meter faster than normal to penalize guessing. Which isn't necessarily so bad, but you *also* don't get the meter bonuses for killing a traitor either so you get double shafted for guesswork.After awhile you can basically know what a villager / card is with high certainty, although it is hard to guarantee anything early on when you know practically nothing of the playing board. Yet the guesswork will punish you for trying. The other issue to deal with is that RNG can end up with some houses rather loaded with traitors, and even if you miraculously uncover them all, killing them in a row is punished because the family house will riot if you sacrifice from them twice in a row, or more.You can try to reach the end of the game without going out of your way to kill the traitors, and simply use the most optimal vilagers to maintain your meter balance. The game is in a sense more about how many of these traitors you can kill before the timer runs out. Completing the mysterious voice's commandments can actually end the run, as the meter threshold immediately gets shifted and might put you in a situation where you have too many meters to balance in one season.Which is odd since, there isn't an actual bonus for killing the specified traitor over the other ones. Killing all 8 other traitors first doesn't cause you any unexpected problems, either. So success may be best achieved by avoiding the voice's tasks and eliminating the other traitors first. I don't know if the game's ending requires you to follow the voice's commandment's only though, and avoid killing traitors before the appointed time. Frankly that's a lot of RNG to wade through for not much gain, IMHO.Oh, and the mix of virtue and vice on a villager doesn't seem to have much in the way of restrictions, so you can end up with some runs where you can't find a villager to give you an even break on points. Others you might find three houses have villagers that actually give you more overall points to your meters, and in the early stages of the game. Town events also aren't particularly common or interesting that I've found.Closing note:I don't strongly feel this is a game that shouldn't be recommended given what you get for the price it is on sale for.However, I do feel the consumer should have a good idea of what you're getting into as this isn't a very high replayability game.  Somewhat similarly simple games like Werewolf have more lifespan because they are social games where the group of people you play with affects gameplay the most dramatically, and what happens on subsequent playthroughs could change dramatically despite the relatively bare and basic game framework.As this is a single player game, I rather reluctantly give it a thumbs down as there simply isn't that much ground to tread with the content provided.  The price is about right, but it would probably be best to still be warned that the depth is shallower than it may appear to be."

Now the game tells me I need to survive 11 years ? Unsure what's going on but the balance is easier to handle than I previously thought, the side objectives now are tricky.- Gameplay, it's really simple and yet so complex : You pick 5 household heads between the 6 available per household (30 in total) each season to form your council and you sacrifice one at the end of said season.The thing is, each one of them have perks and quirks affecting the outcome of the Discipline, Ignorance and so on scale balance.I don't have to say that when one balance or some household affection gets too low, you get a bloody game over.- Story, there's barely any of it in the way that people are used to, the events happen within the town depending on the actions of your council and actually brings you in a deviate way a mental picture of the town, I heard there was multiple endings and so far I saw some little dreams aswell exhorting to do this or that.Overall, an amazing game simply because of it's atmosphere, cunning plays and the Iosefka / Bloodborne reference in it.Also the fact that you can chill infront of it without any timer pressure is really relaxing and allows to treat it like a side game that you can hop on and off if you do desire without any constraint.Nassy recommends."

Took me a couple of tries, but now that I made it, I see no reason to play again. Very little storytelling. Nice sound and artwork, yes. But too little to keep me interested after beating the game not even 3 hours in."
,Recommended,501320,34021782,Posted: 4 August,all,Presence,"A very simplistic hidden identity game. Each villager has a Vice and a Virtue. A Vice is a detriment to your village's resources, and a Virtue is a buff in addition to the villager's House action. So, you might have someone whose House rewards Penitence, with a Virtue that rewards Ignorance, and a Vice that penalizes Devotion. As you assign villagers to actions, you slowly uncover what their Vice or Virtue is. You also increase their House's approval rating, which provides another means of discovering Vices and Virtues.The payoff of discovering the hidden Vices and Virtues is twofold: You can make more efficient resource gathering decisions, and you can also figure out the best villagers to sacrifice to your god, who wants to root out particular Vices over the course of the game.I had a rough but quick first game, then won perfectly on my second playthrough. I'll probably give it a few more plays to grab achievements and experience more of the choose-your-own-adventure story prompts. Expect less of the fantastic word-building of Moon Hunters, and more of a board game-like puzzle."
,Recommended,501320,34051453,Posted: 5 August,all,Link,"I've played through the game 5 times or more so far. There are plenty of reviews here that already tell you how the game plays, so I'll keep this brief.It's a resource balancing game that also has a bit of hidden-identity discovery to it. There is no major story or plot to the game outside of short little vignettes and ""event deck"" stuff that happens which requires you to make a decision on. Every season you choose some people to raise or lower your resource bars, while hopefully finding out who to sacrifice without angering that sacrifice's house. Rinse and repeat 12 times, and you get an ending.I also find it impotant to note that the game DOES come in multiple colors besides puke green. There is a purple/green variant and also a greyish black/red variant.PROS- Very cool aesthetic, reminds me a bit of Darkest Dungeon or Mike Mignola artwork.- Nicely drawn cutscenes.- Solid soundtrack, fits the mood perfectly.- Overall interesting theme/concept as a whole.CONS- Lack of a real story, they really could've done something here. After a playthrough or two you just start clicking through everything and watching bars move up or down. This also means you're less invested in the ""moral quandry"" of the gameplay, because you start seeing everything as numbers instead of characters/people.- The gameplay can be repeatitive if you're not into this kind of thing. Feels more like a game you'd play in short bursts.- Not much variety in how you achieve the different endings.OVERALL OPINIONShrouded Isle is a really great game that doesn't quite reach its full potential. The 10 dollar price tag may feel a little steep for some if they don't intend on replaying it often. I personally didn't mind as I think we should throw our support behind original ideas and concepts even if the execution may not be as perfect as we would have liked in hopes that it inspires more original efforts."

It breaks my shriveled, blackened little heart to disparage something that's clearly a passion project for someone, but I simply cannot reccommend this game with its current level of content.Don't get me wrong - what is in the game is very good.  The presentation is stylish and original, and it is a geniunely unique concept that makes for plenty of strategic options and nail biting tension.  Unfortunatley, the overall quality of the game is severly crippled by the fact that, once youve gone throuhg your first playthrouhgh, you have no reasonn to go back except for achievement hunting.  I hate to be so crude, but there are ""choose your own adventure"" books with higher replay value than The Shrouded Isle.  Just an hour and a half is all it takes to see everything it is the game has to offer, and that same stylish presentatiom seems entirely moot when there is so little to do.  Figuring out the core game mehcanic of assigning duties and choosing the best sacrifice is a neat experience, but once youve got it all figured out, all of the fun has been sucked out of the game and its reduced to simply ticking boxes.Overall, I'd say that The Shrouded Isle has a god-tier presentation, but the lifespan of a mayfly.  I simply cannot reccomend dropping 10 USD on a game that burns itself out well within the refund period.  It is by no means a bad game - as I said, the little content it does have is phenominal - but, if you're like me, the experience is worth only going through once.  With such little staying power and a disproportunatley high price for the level of content, I am left with no other choice but to sacrifice The Shrouded Isle at the altar of the Steam refund policy.If you think you'll like it, and that this is the game for you, I still cautiously, yet wholeheartedly, reccommend this game.  But don't have any illusions about what you're getting into..."

The core mechanic is asking you to make small choices in the hope that a random number generator will give you the information required to make a more meaningful choice at a set interval. But it doesn't. Often! There's very little strategy to be had in this, which for a strategy game is a bit of a problem.On top of that there are numerous, glaring text bugs in the game which speak to the lack of polish found in the gameplay."

It took me two playthroughs to finish it and it's absolutely unsatisfying. While the style of art is great and disturbing, gameplay is repetitive and undemanding, and the very ending honestly disappointing.

It's a game of managing tradeoffs, which I enjoy.  It's sort of a mashup of the mobile game Reigns and the boardgame Mystery of the Abbey.  I didn't particularly enjoy either of those, but smoosh them together like Shrouded Isle does and you get something that's fun.If I had to pick a group of people this would appeal to, I'd say ""boardgamers who enjoy picking apart the systems of thinkier Euro-style games.""It's very dry, in terms of presentation and player interaction.  But there are folks, and I am one of them, who hear ""it's dry"" and their ears perk up.  The turn to the speaker, interested, and inquire ""Dry, you say?""  If you are one of those people, give this one a shot.It's more-ish, in that when a game ends I find myself wanting to try another, but I don't see myself playing it for like 50 consecutive game-hours, either.  I expect I'll play it for a bit, put it down, and come back to it very occasionally for a game here or there, and that's fine (already got my money's worth, after all).I've run into a couple of display bugs, neither very serious (release day, remember); they didn't lessen my enjoyment of the game in any way.  Hitting shift-B in-game will allow you to report bugs while sending a screenshot and debug logs -- something I found out from the forums but don't recall seeing mentioned in-game.The art is--unique.  You're getting exactly what you see in the screenshots here -- sparse art in color palettes I can only describe as ""unsettling.""  I like the art and don't ever want to see another game using this art style, if you will pardon the contradiction.  The soundtrack is appropriately moody but not something I'd listen to on its own.  It has a vibe that reminds me a bit of György Ligeti's work.So, yeah, overall I enjoy it and recommend it, but I think it's only going to appeal to folks with specific tastes."
,Recommended,501320,34041990,Posted: 5 August,all,DonZie,"The Shrouded Isle is a great game to introduce people into management style games. It is not extremely difficult and quite straightforward once you understand the *math* of whats going on. You play favor to certain houses through the decisions you make, the different options carry different outcomes that will effect your ""resource"" meters. If any drop to low and you fail to correct it during the season, you will lose.I played 4 matches before i finally got to the end of the 3 years. Gave me about 3 hours of playing just because i pretty much like to see the ending of games and then im done. If you're a completionist it'll probably give you around 10 hours or maybe more to get all the achievements.TLDR:  If you are new to management style games and want something light to kill time with, this is decent. If you are looking for a management game that will give you multiple play-through and way more game time, also something way harder, do not pick this up.I would better recommend This War of Mine if you are looking for a bigger (way bigger) challenge."

And given the randomization doesn't change up the gameplay any bit, you don't exactly have THAT much of replayability value. Especially because 4/6 endings are actually game overs.Topping it all off, a game takes anywhere from 10-40 minutes, depending on how often you re-read the basic twenty-ish event texts and how fast you fail on your first few tries.As you can see, 2 hours to beat the game thoroughly.It's not bad, but it's not great either, and for it's price, it feels notably too short."
76561198077539151,Recommended,501320,34069830,Posted: 6 August,all,De4dite,"TLDR; The Shrouded Isle is awesome. The visual aesthetic as well as the music set the tone perfectly for the subject matter, and though it seemingly seems simple, the game presents enough variety to warrant multiple playthroughs to achieve different endings.The Shrouded Isle to me felt like a board game more than a videogame. You can play a whole round in about 1 hour, and similarly to board games, there are only so many mechanics that the game will throw out at you, and replaying the game will yield similar experiences (i.e a game of pandemic or settlers of catan). This is not a game that you will spend huge chunks of hours playing, but rather a round here, and round there, whenever the mood strikes. For some this may be nice because you may only have an hour to game and don't want to commit to a larger endeavour.Visually the game is fantastic. The limited sickly yellow green colour pallet of the game mirrors perfectly the chaos and unstableness of the characters and events unfolding during gameplay. The UI is easy to navigate (in part due to the simplicity of the gameplay itself), and you won't find yourself lost in text or information at any point. The character design makes each island member stand out, and the little phrases that pop-up as you hover over them, does actually create some rudimentary character development, and I actually did find myself bonding to an extent with certain characters that were recurring advisors. In that respect it felt akin to Darkest Dungeon.Musically the game is also great. From the haunting bell tones of the opening menu screen, to the different ambient tracks that play as you make decisions throughout the game, it holds it own and contributes greatly to the overall theme of the game. The use of acoustic guitar and drums for one of the main themes was surprising to me at first, though with some getting used to, it eventually stuck. The sound design, though minimal is memorable, to the point where you could recall each house by their respective chimes.I think the main reason why there are some more negative reviews out there is that the expection was for more. I was originally part of that group, and was suprised at how mechanically simple and repetitive the game is. As stated earlier, it is sort of like pandemic, where the experience every time you open the box is going to be similar, and because it's a set difficulty, there is no customization that can take place. It would have been cool to add more calamities, see the result of honoring the God's demands, add more interactions with each house etc etc. However, by the end I was quite satisfied. Once I accepted the game's arguable simplicity, I became much more invested in it, and thouroughly enjoyed the experience.In conclusion, the production value of the game is great, the visual the music, and the unique mechanics that make up the core gameplay of the game make it a very engaging and fun activity to do when you have little windows of downtime. In terms of buying, I would wholeheartedly recommend it, however make sure you understand what you're getting, as it might lead to some disapointment if you expect more than it offers."

It's not bad, it's just much more shallow than the previews might lead you to believe, and once I beat it I had to seriously examine whether or not I would get anything more out of additional plays.

Was your dream colored in Lovecraftian greens?No? You’ve no clue what I’m talking about? Well, I can’t say I blame you.That's the Shrouded Isle, a game with this exact premise. It’s a bit more complex than picking a villager and ending their life; each one has minor or major virtues and vices, which affect you in positive and negative ways, respectfully. Each run of the game is broken up in 12 seasons–it takes place during 3 years– during which you have to sacrifice 12 of your fellow villagers.The villagers, there’s thirty of them, and none come from the most distinct genetic material; each is a member of one of five families, whose primarchs control some different suppression apparatus — the Iosefka family is in charge of the fervor in the village by building monuments and spreading the holy word of Chernobog’s imminent return, the Kegnni make sure that your villagers remain proper and ignorant, and so on and so forth.It’s a game about information, and acting upon it. During each season, you’ve got three months to vote on the activities your cultists make. While you’ve got five councilors — one from each esteemed family on your shrouded isle — you can pick to work on one to three of your councilors’ activities each month; the more the activities worked on, the lesser are the returns for you. It’s a perfectly logical system that allows you to discover more about your villagers’ vices and virtues at only a small cost.Vices and virtues are also found out by inquiries, of which you will get some, as long as you’re in good standing with the different houses; it’s always difficult to decide whom to use your first couple of inquiries, on account of knowing virtually nothing other than some cursory flavor text, give n to you by the house leaders whenever you scroll over the members of the family.shroudedisle1Villagers and the five attributes of the entire village–Ignorance, Fervor, Discipline, Penitence and Obedience–are not the only ones you have to be on the lookout for; each house also has an approval rating that raises when you continually vote for their advisers, and falls whenever you ignore them. Approval also plummets whenever you decide to sacrifice someone; particularly if you have no proof, or even an idea, of an advisor’s transgressions.‘This might all seem like a lot to follow, and I did have some difficulty making sense of it all during my first game; which is why one of the families quickly rose in revolt, and did me in, thus ending playthrough #01. That said, once I began all over again, it made sense and, in less than two hours, I stood above the precipice, awakening good old ‘bog and watching him as he stretched those holy wings of his.The Shrouded Isle is all about revealing information one month at a time, and using that information to the fullest. There’s no overarching storyline, when one really could’ve worked quite well.The art-style is good but minimalist, and there are about…eight screens in the game overall, with an additional three-four cutscenes.It’s entertaining for what it is…but I’m not certain that it’s worth the price tag of 10 euro. That has to be its biggest weakness; the Isle simply doesn’t have enough content. After my two and a half hours, I have absolutely no desire to go back and replay it in its current form; if the developers introduce a content-focused patch, perhaps I will.The Shrouded Isle is an interesting experiment that’s built around a cool concept, strong aesthetics and ambiance, but hobbled by lack of variety and lacking a cohesive story.Should you play it? Only you could say that, and I hope to have provided all the tools necessary to help with your decision. Happy Gaming!PS: I know there are different endings–but I didn’t feel curious enough to spend another few hours unlocking them.Also, if you'd like to follow my blog for more, follow this link:https://filip-magnus-writes.blog"

The 'Lovecraftian' tag was quite misleading as it lacks 'da feels'. Sure, you have your own crapsack village in which everything (and practically everyone) should be purged and make sacrifices to a slavic demon god. But it sure feels more like an Orwell society where the Big Brother ain't you and all the god does is adjusts your sliders a little so your game turns feel different. Well guess what, they don't. What else? It's short and probably unreplayable (I've heard there are different endings but eh).Also, a basic tutorial would be fine. While it's quite easy to figure out what to do it takes a game or two until you know what you're doing. Y'know, just an overview of what the traits/affections are and why you need those.Best of luck to the devs, the idea's quite entertaining, which I can't say for the actual game process.Maybe the game was meant as a casual and those just don't captivate me as much."

Basically that's it. Simple gameplay without much depth or replayability. The setting turned out to be replaceable, with little background story provided, and even the people are replacable - literally, because they are replaced with random persons every game.One reviewer suggested the art style support an oppressive atmosphere and I believed them. It turned out, there is not much atmosphere, though. You don't get to know much about the world or its people. You don't really feel connected to any of them. When you sacrifice one, it's ""whatever.

,Recommended,501320,34027626,Posted: 4 August,all,ToxicTromeo,"At it's most basic, The Shrouded Isle has you using randomly applied traits to keep balance between the houses.  Each season has you picking five people - one from each house - and putting them to work for you.  Based on their traits, they may raise obedience, fervor, ignorance, etc. - or lower it.  You learn a bit about each of these people as you play and at the end of a season you have an important decision to make - which one is a sinner and needs to be sacrificed.  After all, you're a High Priest and your god expects something!  Sometimes you may get tasked with raising a certain trait, sacrificing a specific type of person, or other mini-quests.  You'll also encounter various people from the houses who may have problems they want you to solve (such as a son getting arrested).Graphically there isn't much to The Shrouded Isle.  And that's a good thing.  It looks great the way it is and the minimal design adds a certain charm to the somewhat dark nature of the game.  Personally I found the soundtrack to be pretty good, too - especially for a small indie title.I really have very little to say that's bad about the title - the price being the only real issue.  While the game is enjoyable and I didn't mind paying it, it may be slightly steep for some folks for the amount of content.  But that aside, I easily recommend this game if you're into strategy, hidden identity, or other similar type titles.May all your sacrifices be true heretics!Knocking out a few seasons here if you want to see me fail:https://youtu.be/qOl01952MTc"
,Recommended,501320,34027605,Posted: 4 August,all,archonsod,"Gameplay is fairly straightforward - you pick one advisor from each house at the start of each season, then use up to three of them each month (three to a season) to balance out the 'virtue' levels of your village.Each potential advisor has one virtue (which will boost one of the bars) and one vice (which will drop one of the bars). Hidden amongst the advisors are eight who have unforgivable vices that you're trying to hunt down and sacrifice at the end of the season.Alongside this you're also balancing out your reputation with each of the houses, who tend to get annoyed when you sacrifice their people or fail to consult their advisor. Let a house get too annoyed with you and your career (and life) will come to an end.On the whole it's a nice little logic puzzler / deduction game. Presentation is good - the monochrome grows on you after a while (and you can switch between three colours). Music is nice and atmospheric, with each house having it's own signature tune.The game generally takes around 45 - 60 minutes for a full three year game. There's no save feature, although it's not really needed - it's the kind of game you can dip into while listening to a podcast or have an hour to spare."

Time is running short. Our dark patron awaits our devotion, and he speaks to me--personally--in the dark realm of my dreams, where my fragile mortal mind can come closest to appreciating his messages. He commands me to prove our worth by burning out the sin and corruption in our community. His return is coming soon.Cannily, I suss out the innermost flaws of my little flock. I ask devotees to spill the secrets they've learned, tattle on each other, and point fingers. I use the authority of the circle to put people to the test, granting them power and then silently observing what they do with it. Each season, I mark one for death.On the night of the end of summer, with fall's tint not yet creeping in among the trees, he came to me in my sleep and bade me obey him: find the artist among my people, who threatens the careful ignorance I've cultivated in them, and kill her on the ritual table. I use all my skills to identify the threat, and......I can't kill her right away, because her family already isn't happy and if I sacrifice their daughter they'll rebel.The heart of my dissatisfaction with The Shrouded Isle is the odd mismatch between its atmosphere and its gameplay. The basic game functionality is about managing a set of ten meters. Five meters are the qualities of the worshippers (ignorance, fervor, discipline, penitence, obedience) and five are how happy each family is with you. Each family member (there are 30) has a positive trait and a negative trait that determine how they affect the five quality meters. Choosing to use someone from a family will make the family like you. Choosing to kill them will tank their happiness score. So the gameplay comes down to managing the meters to keep everyone happy enough that you can kill the people you need to without pushing any family into the critical ""rebellious"" zone, and without dropping any quality meter into the critical red zone (either is a game over).That strategic gameplay is engaging for the short time the game takes, but it feels out of step with the game's core idea  of managing an arcane cult. A lot of artistry (though by that I mean quality, not quantity--the art is good but there's not actually that much of it) goes into getting you into the role of the cult leader, but then the game obligates you to make *strategic* decisions instead of *role-playing* decisions. You can easily be penalized for doing the thing that makes the most sense in-universe, which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. If the game set things up differently, and made it clearer that your grip on these families isn't so tight in the first place, I could more easily forgive it, but I didn't get that impression.It's also rather short--I had to try a few times before I got the hang of the game, but if you know what you're doing from the get-go you could probably finish this in less than half an hour."

You're juggling five different aspects of faith, as well as the approval of the five families, and the deity's approval. The problem is, taking the difficult route (in terms of finding traits) and just using one advisor per month may get your +10 to that aspect, and +5-15 to another aspect...but their sins take away 10-30. Using all 3 advisors can mean gaining 40 or so points between the various aspects, but losing as many as 90 points. And then you have one month to recover whatever was ruined, and you may end up with an advisor who takes away from the very aspect you're trying to recover.- Only one difficulty level. See above. While the challenge is fun, I've gone through 40-50 times without ever making it the full three years. There are too many balls in the air, and the downsides of each action are significantly more than the upsides.

But, I don't like playing it that way. I like to track down all the ""major sinners"". This is more challenging.The trick to this game is understanding what vices lead to what major sins. When you get the message from God he gives you a target, he also ramps up one of your virtues and forces you to keep that higher than the others. The trick to finding the target is knowing which base vice results in the sin he detests. Each citizen has a virtue and a vice. Some are minor, and some are major. The trick is to utilize the folks with major virtues and eliminate the ones with major vices as the God dictates. So you will want to inquire about the folks with those base vices (like unrepentent for example) and herd them up so you can uncover the major sinner that season. This is while balancing your virtues and making sure they don't get too low.There's plenty of strategy to be had in this simple little game for for those who like to do simple logic with resource management, it is a pretty fun game. Don't expect loads of weapons and units, it isn't that kind of game. But do expect some fun game play in this simple setting. If you just want to blow through and get to the end you can do that, but if you want to ferret out the sinners while you manage your resources you get a lot more fun out of this game."

It oozes atmosphere and has a very dry (and very dark) sense of humor. My only critique is that the game is fairly easy to win, and there's really only one strategy that the game rewards (i.e., try to keep everything in balance). Starting conditions from one playthrough to the next aren't really distinct enough to encourage you to try out different ways of playing, and the game is very forgiving of small tactical errors and mistakes in a way that makes winning feel less satisfying than if the game were a bit more strict. Still, it was a very enjoyable experience and I highly recommend it!"

Would definitley recommend, and hope for similair content in the future."

The game is an interstingly managment game where you have five traits and five houses to keep satisfied while sacrficing a villager.The inqury stage gives 0-2 inquries of virtiues and vices  or reveals of for each family dempending on their favor. Rebellious - 0 Dissatisified - 0 netural -1 satisfied -1 zealous -2If a family is rebellious and are not placiated be the next season they will kill you.The other traits are vaues of the town: Ignorance, fervor, discpline, pentince, and obdeience. These traits are affected by the various families though other charchters' vices and virtues affect them as well.After the inqury advisory selection,there is the task selection, it can be a balancing act of trying to discovery vices and virtues, while raising certain traits. The fewer tasks you assgin the greater the affect of family morale and the increase or decrease the traits.All of this comes together to quite a challegne to keep from losing in tweleve turns and when you lose you get the feeling like you know how to do better,so you play again.The music and art are also great.________________________________________I feel there could be some user interface improvements. I feel the bottom toolbar where the names of the houses are should be clickable to open the advisor selection/inqury window. It gets slightly teadious to close the window each time.Further, I would feel that it would be helpful if the that house was noted on that toolbar.Another thing I feel would be useful is that when selecting someone to inqury/choose as an advisory instead of having to click the inqury/ choose advisor button utialize the mouse an allow an option where make chose the advisor left click and inqury right click. It's a very small complaint, but having to move back and forth from the right of the screen getting."

It can take a little bit to get the hang of using your inquisitors to make inquiries to discover virtues/vices, but it's a nice little game with an eerie atmosphere and retro-looking (but well done) Gameboy graphics and color."

I easily lost hours playing this, repeating ""One more try, ONE MORE TRY!""  It can be frustrating when you can't get traits to reveal in time, or have a trait fail to stay in the positive.  Regardless, this is incredibly fun.  It took about 10 hours of gameplay before I finally hit ONE of the endings, and you'd better believe I'll keep playing to see the variables in the endings.Highly recommend"
