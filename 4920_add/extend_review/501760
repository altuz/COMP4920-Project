,Not Recommended,501760,24543721,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,CrazyCanuck,"OverviewThis is not a good game. (Quick video at end of overview)Franciscaseems like a very quick, very cheap attempt at the “walk around a small location and try to survive” genre. Unlike other games of its ilk, such asEmily Wants to PlayandBoogeyman, which have some sort of polish and gameplay, this has neither. The game runs in Unity Personal (because of course), and its window is named “Pet_Project”. Hopefully this was thrown together quickly as part of some school program.You play as a fourteen year old who has footsteps that sounds like he’s wearing heavy duty combat boots. Your parents have gone to Mexico, and you’re alone in the house. You decide to open a random present sitting on your porch, because obviously, which, also obviously, unleashes the ghost girl.Your goal is to survive seven nights by managing your fear meter, which seems to constantly go up but never actually drop on its own. The popup at the beginning that tells you how to play states that the farther she is from you, the more your fear goes up, which seems backwards. Shouldn’t you be more calm if she’s nowhere near you? Either way, since your fear skyrockets and it’s almost instant game over when she’s near you, it’s a bit confusing. You can close your eyes to lower your fear, and the game conveniently tells you that doing this will stop you from being able to see AND hear her. I’m pretty sure if I close my eyes, or even cover them with a blindfold, I’ll still be able to hear. Not sure what the developer was going for here.Setting up cameras and switching to their feeds to see where she is, and to try to avoid her, is an interesting but flawed mechanic. Your fear continues to rise, even though you know where she is in relation to you. Also, if you stand in front of a camera and switch to the feed, you’re invisible. There is nothing that shows up on the tablet. Perhaps there’s an ending where it turns out you’re a vampire. Would that explain how you suddenly lose your hearing when you can’t see?You may look at the screenshots and think the game looks pretty good for being one dollar, and you’d be right. It looks decent. However, it’s very choppy. Did you watch the trailer? That’s not the video that’s choppy, that’s the game. On a high-end system, it chugs along, and if you choose to bring out your tablet, it chugs even more. Downstairs in the kitchen, with the tablet open, looking through the camera also set up in the kitchen, Fraps showed me single-digit FPS. That’s just poor.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrmMdVAMC3cProsCheapHas trading cards, so you can make back a portion of the costLooks…not badConsBoring gameplayNot much variationPoorly optimizedTypical and expected jump scaresOdd design choices (closing eyes prevents hearing, further she is from you the more you are scared, etc.)SummaryFranciscais not a good game. If you’re a badge collector, you can’t really go wrong for the price, but otherwise, avoid it. There are many other games that will offer you far more value and enjoyment."

This game is a mixture of both good and bad. It has potential but it runs slow, gets repetitive and costs money when it's the equivalent of a free indie horror game. The concept of the game is simple but fun, however the game defies logic. Apparently when you close your eyes you can't hear anything. Mind blown. The game runs slow unless you have a PC with a decent processor but it downloads super fast. Mind re-blown and then blown again. Overall it's fun but lacks basic content/features and the system requirements for it are ridiculous."

,Not Recommended,501760,24629700,"Posted: 31 July, 2016",all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Francisca is one of the very few ""dollar"" horror games that've cropped up on Steam, being released in late July 2016 by publisher/developer BiscuitPlay. For such a low price, it's hard for a horror fiend such as myself to resist checking it out. The basic story is that you play as a 14 year old kid named Mike, whose parents have gone to Mexico for a week. Prior to this, Mike has been hearing strange noises around his new home.The gameplay is rather basic, you have four cameras on tripods that you set up around your house and then observe their feed through your tablet. Once you answer the knock at the front door and grab the present, Francisca is unleashed. She screams and begins sporadically popping in and out of rooms. The ultimate goal is to avoid her entirely to survive the night, which is about five minutes. When she is close to you,your fear meter rises and if your fear meter reaches 100, it's game over. Oh, and when you're too far away... the meter goes up as well, so don't think you can cheat and stay outside of the house the whole time. It's a ridiculous concept.Now, this game is an obvious rip-off of Five Night's at Freddy's; honestly, Steam, I thought we were over this garbage cropping up around the place... I guess not. There is a tiny, smidgen of difference, since instead of sitting in a stagnant spot you can actually move around. Overall, Francisca is a very boring experience and a poor excuse for a ""horror"" game. There is no horror, there's not even a lame jumpscare, and Francisca herself doesn't even look remotely scary; quite honestly, I laughed the first time I saw her and her block bobble-head.Did I mention that this game is brought to you by Unity: Personal Edition? Yeah, that's right, so expect AWFUL optimization. I have an i7 6700k + GTX 1080 rig, this game dipped into the 20 FPS for me; to put that in perspective, I can run The Witcher 3 at all max settings and still maintain 100+ FPS at all times. This is absolutely unacceptable, even for a dollar, show some pride in your work.I won't even comment on the terrible English translations in the game. Too long, didn't read? Francisca is a mostly Five Night's at Freddy's clone with minor additives that still manages to have incredibly boring gameplay. It doesn't deserve to be classified as a ""horror"" game since there are simply no horror elements included. The game has terrible optimization, and sees sub-30 FPS on THE current highest end graphics card. There are so many better games that you can get for a dollar, like Blood and Bacon. Avoid this completely and don't pay for someone's awful Year One project, you won't regret your decision. I honestly have no idea how this game has gotten 80+ positive reviews so far.Rating:0.5/5.0- Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"
76561198045824156,Not Recommended,501760,24736905,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,Senshu XD,"A tragic tale of poor 14 year old Mike left at home to fend for himself as his parents decided to leave him behind as they travel to Mexico. Little Mike is not alone however, as the neighborhood creeper girl Francisca insists on playing a terrifying game of hide-and-seek with him each and every night.As I load up the first night, I can see that Mike is clearly in distress as he stomps around the house in his Megatron boots which make enough noise to wake up everyone in a 10 mile radius. The poor boy has also left out not only the milk, but orange juice as well. The sudden shock of his parents straight up ditching him has caused trauma to a degree so great that he's forgotten to put these basic necessities back into the fridge. As I jounrey further into the house, I continue to see things that are clearly not right here. Poor Mike doesn't even have a bedroom of his own, which further raises the question....if his parents can afford not only a trip to Mexico, but 4 4k HD cameras for him to play with, why couldn't they afford a bedroom for him?Picking up the present left by the girl starts this terrifying life-or-death game of hide and seek, to which Mike only has one clear option, the closet. He jumps inside, shuts the doors, and closes his eyes. This stumps Francisca as she wanders all over the house, but never thinks once to open the closet Mike is in. This game goes on for 7 days, and on each day, Mike choses the same closet over and over, and by great delight, he triumphs over Francisca who is officially the worst hide and seek player in history, no wonder no one wanted to play with her.In conclusion, Francisca is a game with a great Slenderman-ish idea, but poor execution. The girl's AI is laughable at best and the 4 cameras you're given to ""track her"" are completely useless, as she can just seemingly teleport wherever she wants in the house. So please, save your dollar on another game. My biggest regret is going over the 2 hour limit, so I can't refund it myself.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99SuPIfjIo"
,Not Recommended,501760,24782334,"Posted: 8 August, 2016",all,DracoMalus,"Not sure I get what this game is about.  It says it's about spending 7 nights alone in a house with teh ghost of a little girl who likes to play hide and seek.  Well, she's VERY good at playing hide and seek because this games feel more like a ""spend 15 minutes setting up cameras aroudn your house then pick up the present at the dorr and then get a big game over screen"" because that's all it's been in the 4 times I've started this game.Set the cameras up, get the present and then...what is supposed to be done from there?  Three of the four times playing I get ""Game Over"" within moments of picking up the present and I have no clue what happened.   The 3rd time I actially saw the girl and got an immediate game over.   Apparently the girl is supposed to make some kind of noise, singing I think the text said, but haven't heard anything.Seeing as the learning curve for this game is trial and error but the penatly for failure is starting from scratch and having to spend time to set up cameras again there is nothing that compels me to even want to figure it out.Despite the latest patch mentioning performance improvements teh performance is still pretty off.  Don't these game engine websites have tutorials to teach people how to make their games run smoothly?As it is the graphics look decent enough and it seems neat that it takes less than 100mb of space.  And the camera to tablet feature cool, but having the tablet out severely impacts performance."

Basically its a game of hide and seek against the most laughable looking ghost I've ever seen in a 'horror' game. And just to make the game more irritating, if you get too far from the ghost that your hiding from, you die. If you get too close you die. There are cameras you can set up, but I never found any reason to bother - just find a closet to hide in and ride your right mouse button to win.So overall its slow and plodding, with average mechanics. Unless you really want a cheap time filler there are far better horror games available."

By closing your eyes, you can get the meter to go down. You can see where the ghost is by watching the cameras, but this will fill up your fear meter.Positioning the cameras does give an illusion of strategy, however the gameplay is just hiding in a closet and closing your eyes, waiting for the scary girl ghost monster to leave.Francisca - First Impression recorded at 60fpshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsqngDyxuWE0:00 Starting the game, instructions, and exploring the house.2:35 Setting the up the cameras for the first time.5:54 Ok, everything set up, now let's accept the present and call the ghost...6:38 Aaaaaand I died.12:15 Looking at the camera images for the girl, not realising my fear is increasing whether the girl is close or not ...18:51 Taking a look around outside, the garage, ...20:12 Hiding in the closet upstairs ...20:24 Jumpscare!As usual pics on my fb."

I guess she didn't realize what was up, because day 2 she came ready to play. We were laughing all the way through. Whether it was the terrible textures (the car seats, and wall lights in particular are amazingly terrible), or the fact you can die by being too far away from the ghost (ex. Standing out in the middle of the yard), or the fact the camera system does nothing for you since you have to constantly be rushing the ghost down in order to stay alive and tempt death at the same time; if you can't find something so bad to laugh at and enjoy then you're going about sub-dollar games in the wrong way.::TL:DR:: It's less than a dollar, and at least worth some laughs for how amusingly bad the game is.
