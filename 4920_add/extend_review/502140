,Not Recommended,502140,24418251,"Posted: 19 July, 2016",all,Frogge,"Edit: I mistook the developer with their shady publisher. I apologize for this and take full responsibility for my mistake. I have not edited the review yet as I still cannot be 100% sure that RPG video and Sir Dan are not the same person. I also apologize for being a little too extreme. Anyway, here's the review.Edit: Ok, pretty sure now. I have edited the review to give feedback. Again, apologies for my mistake and the best of luck to the real developer with updates.Every once in a while you see a game on steam that just makes you go ''why''. WHY. This, for me, is that game.You are thrown into the game without a single idea of what is going on. Apparently you were with your friend Dyart out fishing so your mum can make ''fish pie''(can anyone please tell me if that's even a real thing?). After that the game is a series of random events happening without a single explanation. Your mum asks you to pick apples. When you do find the apples though, they are not even apples. It's a box of corn. A BOX OF CORN. And somehow the game expects you to figure out that's apples and take it to your mum? And even this early, you can find a game breaking bug. If you interact with your mother in the wrong direction your character will become unable to move and you will have to restart the game. The dialogue is so poorly written to the point where it has zero punctation and has a lot of typos.There is only one good thing I can say about the game: I like the menu. The game tells you it has minigames, which sounds cool but then you realize they are just a bunch of pre-made scripts without the slightest bit of modification. The story is pretty much unexistant, and everything is just random. There are random encounters all around the place and they are always just the same (default rpg maker) enemies, with the exception of the ''slime'' monster. But it's not even a slime. It's a giant furry animal, not a ♥♥♥♥ing slime. You don't have any skills when you start the game, so the monsters are just defeated by mashing spacebar and using an item when needed. There is one town in the game which is another sample map, but using a pre-bought resource pack for rpg maker. Now, I have nothing against pre-bought packs. In fact, the one the developer used is a really nice looking pack. But the tiles are used SO INCORRECTLY and DON'T FIT WITH THE REST OF THE GAME'S STYLE, which kinda ruins it. You are given random quests without any explanation to why you should do them and the game is just so random that it stopped being funny after the first minute of gameplay. And in the same town, it is possible to walk over trees and fences.The game definetly needs to be updated before being properly playable, but in it's current state it's not exactly worth buying. I have spoken with the developer, and apparently they are planning to update the game to fix a lot of the bugs, so I'll be re-reviewing the game when that happens.10/10"
76561198061502929,Not Recommended,502140,29858584,Posted: 11 February,all,karinms,"The game has been updated and patched, sometime in March I think. Most of the annoying things seems to have been fixed but there are still aspects that could really do with a proper Beta-player (or several). It's once again playable, though I'm not changing my ""thumb down"" for this game. For a long while it was bugged right from the start (see my original review) but the various triggers seem to trigger now and I'm pretty sure there are no broken achievements.The good things mentioned in my original review are still good. But! You still don't have any idea what to do since there are very few clues in where to go and who to talk to (there's a video walkthrough for an earlier version without an ending but at least it's somewhat helpful). It's very easy to miss triggers that ""open"" up more of the game because at least one of them need you to walk over a certain area and another to read a sign. Yeah.-----------ORIGINAL REVIEWThis is a crappy, broken and most likely abandoned game. Unfortunately. I started playing it in July 2016 but took a break from it (luckily after getting the chicken achievement) because it was very clearly an Early Access game, despite being sold/advertised as a full/finished game. I wanted to wait until they had added features like NPCs, items, chests, quests etc. You know, normal things you should be able to experience in a game. I was also annoyed with all the design flaws like walking on trees and being blocked by grass. Some things are now fixed, but most are still badly designed with blocked off areas and invisible doors.Good thing: they've added NPCs, items, chests, quests and fixed some bad designs/layouts and unkillable monsters.Bad thing: they broke the game with the (probably) latest update/fix sometime late last year.If you're a new player starting a new game, you won't be leaving the first village because a main quest trigger won't be triggered in the first chapter's very beginning. Game Over. Result: 2/8 achievements.If you're like me, continuing a saved game from outside the first village in the first chapter will take you all the way to the second chapter's very beginning where, once again, a main quest trigger won't be triggered. Game Over. Result: 6/8 achievements or, if you got the Chicken Rancher achievement before the ""fix"", 7/8 achievements."

I'm laughing and I'm crying because the dev clearly put so much work into it, has a ton of ideas, with the minigames, but like...I just can't.  I got it for 90% off, and I still can't recommend it with the grammar, spelling, and...I don't even know, man. Just, the main characters, with their robust status menu entries, and then...nothing. Nothing. I don't even know what I'm playing.It'd probably be super funny to play stoned or drunk though, from the monsters if nothing else. Cats everywhere.Keep trying, dev, don't give up. I'll check it out later when you touch things up some more."
76561198083702738,Recommended,502140,24450668,"Posted: 21 July, 2016",all,Slip N' Dip,"I like RPGs a lot so this was a no brainer for me for its meager price on sale.  This RPG is decent enough but I can't recommend this game until it gets updated.  I think the combat system is fine but I wish the game would tell you the hit points of the enemy during combat.  Not knowing what you're up against makes it difficult to plan moves and strategies during combat.  I was fighting the Lamia in an abandoned town and I fought it for at least 5-10 minutes before it died.  I kept wondering whether it would be killed or not during every turn.  This doesn't bother me too much but it would be nice if added in.I also would like their to be a quest log or notes so you can remember what you have to do when you leave the game.  If there is one, I can't find it in the menu.  And you can't go back to the person who gave you the directions to read the quest again.  While this makes sense in terms of dialogue, it makes it difficult to complete the game.  I would just like a little bit more direction throughout the game and for the story to be more fleshed out than it is now.I saw that Sir Dan said that this was an Indonesian RPG so I understand why there are spelling and grammatical errors in the dialogue.  I would like to see some attempts to fix some errors here and there to make the game a little more appealing.Overall, I wouldn't say it is a bad game, but I don't think it has reached its potential.  I think if they fixed these things or just released some updates to flesh out the game more I could easily recommend it.I also appreciate that the developers are responding to feedback regularly and taking the time to fix errors and bugs. Therefore, I would not define the developers as ""lazy"".  I can forsee myself recommending the game in the future as long as they keep updating.Edit: In light of recent updates and continual support of the game by the developer, I have chosen to recommend this game as it continues to grow."

I liked how the game looked because its graphics reminded me of some of my old gameboy games. The problem is that I could not enter the blue house, which I found out was necessary to start main adventure of the game. I also could not leave the home town, so no side adventures. So, the game is bugged to where you cannot play the game. I did not read the other reviews and I regretted it. So, do not make the same mistake I did. If the game does get fixed to where I can play it then I will review it again and have the new review be based on the gameplay. If AVGN starts reviewing games on Steam he should do this game."

,Not Recommended,502140,30018629,Posted: 18 February,all,JJCobra,"Broken by the Devs and then apparently abandoned.  Appears to be the first attempt at making a game as there are mistakes galore.  First map is broken and non of the triggers work to advance the story.  Leaving any store in town brings you out the exit of the weapons shop.  Stilted text that in no way reflects how an actual human speaks.  And since I've been limited to the opening town there hasn't been a single interesting character or even anything interesting said by any of the NPCs.Random question that really bothers me.  Why don't any of the buildings or rooms have doors?  Even the room at the inn where the kids that's waiting in the lobby are messing about.  The door is non-existant, meaning I can watch this kids parents go at it.  Maybe they're swingers?  IF so, why can't I join in and run a train on the mom?"

And maybe because of this I can't recommend this game.The setting could be interesting...but the story is so generic.Searching for a lost city. Dungeons, chests, ship, airship...hurray. If there only was a little meat.I mean just seconds after I found the ship I got my airship...only....you  can travel sure but you can only enter most towns after playing through the story. And belive me finding the next part of the story is the hard thing. Example: for the ship you should talk to someone in the castle....now you would think its the king you must talk to..but no its a simple soldier (there is no king in the castle).And he tells you to talk to the captain. OK, there was someone looking like a captain in a casino.But no....the captain is also in the castle, only he looks like a common sailor.Getting the ship the only hint about what to do next is that ONE sentence your latest party member said...If there is a quest log I have not found it (oh and no map). But no problem, if you talk to every NPC you'll get a shovel and than.....dunno...talking again to everybody so maybe you'll get the next hint?  No, sorry but you must dig every space in this city to find a key?And than after a long walk through a dungeon.....I emerged just a few steps from where Ifound the airship....and the town I couldn't enter before is now open.......Maybe a joke was that during your stay at an Inn you had a one night stand with yourfemale party member...and surprise in the next dungeon she tells you that she is pregnant.And belive me that was the most anticlimactic romance scene I watched...ever!!!!No, sorry but there are more interesting RPGMaker games around,even if this is a cheap one its not worth spending more time."

Second, most of the content seems to be taken from RPGMaker ""as is"" which is fairly disappointing. There is apparently an update to the game that will amend this so I'll consider changing my recommendation on the game when that day comes. Finally, the story is fairly threadbare - JRPG after all, so crystals, demons, and saving the world.This is one of those times that I wish that Steam had a mid-way point between pass and fail. Sure it's probably good for some warm and familiar fun, and it's flaws can mostly be overlooked if you're aware of them going in.Pros+Fun and silly JRPG-inspired game+CheapCons+Odd and unevenly told story+Like really odd - it just incorporates other JRPG tropes in a weird manner+Unsure if done ironically+Game doesn't appear fully finished - please hire a proof-reader!"
