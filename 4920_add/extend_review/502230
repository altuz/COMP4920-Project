So glad that the remastered version was made available to the general public instead of being a Kickstarter only reward. Keep up the good work, can't wait for Godfall!You can find the full game for free on a number of different websites. I personally was happy to spend the $5 to support the developer and play in full screen."

Some of the text hasn't even been changed like with difficulty selection that still proposes one of the game modes is ""new"".  Overall I would recommend this game if the images interest you even though it is bare bones, however it is quite an enjoyable experience.  I am not sure it is worth the $5 price point considering you can still find practically the full game online for free though."
,Recommended,502230,24429949,"Posted: 20 July, 2016",all,Silverdraggin,For 5 bucks is a fun little dungeon crawl.  Each level gives you the opportunity to raise stats and choose a skill.  New more difficult creatures as you go down the rabbit hole.  The ability to sell your unwanted gear without going to the vendor is a great addition to the game vs. the free version.  I played the game all the time on Kongregate and happily support the dev and their continued contribution to the Monster's Den games.  Can't wait for the next one.
,Recommended,502230,30970599,Posted: 5 April,all,Luxbu | Game Gamut,"I absolutely love this game. Back in highschool when this was a web browser game, I would sign up for computer classes just to play this game secretly in a corner.What I love most about the remastered version of the game is that not a single thing changed. There is so much loot to be had, so many boss fights, and bad♥♥♥♥♥legendary monsters to hunt. To my knowledge, the game has no end. You can beat the campaign, but it lets you keep playing anyway for the sake of things.It's simple enough to play casually, but challenging enough to make you think. The most fun part is its Diablo 2 skill tree mechanics that you try some really unique parties.Truth be told and all things considered, I do think this game shot itself in the foot of offering the price at $5. It was a free web browser game back in the day. This game is an easy buy for any dungeon crawl or RPG fan at a less price.Seriously, this should be considered a classic in any dungeon crawl gamer's repitoire."

It's nothing special, but I appreciate the simplicity of it and the combat is enjoyable, plus I'm always a sucker for the classic Western CRPG style.  The roguelike elements will certainly lend itself well to repeated playthroughs.  Ultimately, it's just a relaxing game that I'll certainly sink many hours into.  If you're a dungeon junkie you can't go wrong at 5 bucks.  Looking forward to achievements and more games from this developer."

The inventory system is pretty awful - but I do really like the combat, even if it can be a bit tough and prone to the vaguaries of the RNG gods at times.I'd recommend it, but I'd also recommend waiting until it's on special."

I definitely recommend getting this game if you even in the littlist, enjoy dungeon crawling games, especially since this games' replayable makes this game much more than worth what it costs."
76561198257550542,Recommended,502230,31517067,Posted: 2 May,all,MetalTreads,"This is another game I first discovered as a browser game on Notdoppler.  It's an incredibly fun game.  You create a party of up to 4 heroes and enter a dungeon.  Once you beat the ""final"" boss (at level 10) you can then enter an endless dungeon mode, which is exactly what it sounds like: a neverending dungeon generator.  ""But MetalTreads, if it's a browser game, why wouldn't I just go play it for free there?"" you ask.  Weeeeell, for one this version is saved to steam, not browser history so you can never lose progress unless you delete it. As well, you can access it from any computer that has steam. For two, you can use custom portraits for your heroes.  For three, full screen + good quality graphics = what more do I need to say?  For four, it's only $4.99 so even if you don't like it you're not down that much.  I love it and highly recommend it to anyone who likes WoW-ish type stuff."

I'm not very leet and the game has difficulty settings that can give me a challenge without making me rage quit.I've tried about 3 games like this before and this one is the best I've played by far.  If you're looking for a dungeon crawl rogue-like (optional), that's friendly on the learning curve, yet still challenging, and fun.   This is a good investment of your gaming dollars.10/10 will continue to play this.  :)"
,Recommended,502230,30840546,Posted: 30 March,all,Lokaror,"I like many others played this game online first, and didnt mind dropping the money, because i knew i had already honestly gotten that much out of it in its free to play days (is it free to play if the game didnt sell you anything? I digress) and the game would be worth it in its entirety anyways. For soemone who just wants to relax with an arpg and doesnt want a sprawling epic tale at that moment i highly reccomend. Deep enough to be interesting, simple enough for a quick break. I reccomend."

I don't consider $4.50 on sale alot for a game, and developers after all need to eat.  Having said that, this is a great game.  It reminds me quite a bit of Might and Magic 6-8 without the ""pretty"" graphics.  Will probably be playing this one for a long time to come.  Will probably try Godfall when it comes out as well.9 / 10."

,Recommended,502230,24445197,"Posted: 21 July, 2016",all,corvek,"I played this game on Kongregate many years ago, so most of my time with it is on there.I really do wish there was a side-ways thumb on Steam, because I can't say that I 100% recommend this game. The reason I do, however, is that Monsters' Den is a pretty chill and enjoyable game. It's not super flashy or in depth or anything. It's very much just a point and click turn based strategy RPG. If you're going into this expecting Baldurs Gate level game design (Or whatever good RPG you've played recently) you're going to be very disappointed. It's just a fantastic time waster. Lots of loot. Infinite dungeon crawling. Bosses that can actually be challenging. Stuff like that.The reason I would have given this game a thumbs down is that there's very little in terms of upgrades from their flash version on other websites. Aside from increased resolution support, I don't really see anything different or real worth while that I would spend over $5 on.That being said, this game is only 5 bucks, and what did exist on other websites was a really enjoyable experience. I recommend giving it a try, purely because it's so cheap and can be pretty addicting if you're into games that aren't demanding of your time and energy."

Based on the Flash game, but now with fullscreen. Well worth the $5, though the procedurally generated floors can get repetitive-- it's better as something to dip into every now and then."

You can create your party, and you adventure through a 2-D map. You can find chests, orbs that revitalize you, and encounters. Encounters take place in a card style format.While I am unsure, it does seem to be sort-of a flash game port. That said it is fun. And if you get it on discount, even better."
