,Recommended,502280,32538953,Posted: 18 June,all,Zoa13Mirabilis,"This is a game for Berserk fans, if you're after a more filled out hack and slash game there are better options out there. I enjoyed myself playing this title but I'm an old Berserk fan. Like similar games in the genre it can get boring once you beat the story and try out the other modes just slashing apart humans & monsters repeatedly, the different play styles of characters and the various objectives do make it more interesting, and it is a great title like others in the genre to play while watching or listening to something on the side.Pros: Currently has the most accurate respresentation of the manga in animated form, shows many characters not yet seen or fleshed out in the anime/movies and the story is mostly well done. Combat is smooth and objectives don't have you running around aimlessly. Movesets across playable characters are accurate in my opinion but can be frustrating to play as certain characters sometimes (but they can't all be beasts in battle lIke Guts & Zodd).Cons: Objectives can be odd sometimes, base commanders on levels where it doesn't seem necessary to have them for example. Bosses can be annoying to fight due to their cheap moves and large size, they can trap you in a corner or block the camera, spam attacks you can't escape from causing your death.Few characters playable, I would have liked to play as other characters from the series and I was confused why some characters were even made playable in the first place. Also key story moments were altered due to censorship issues that non fans of the series will be greatly confused by, again censorship also had key story moments entirely omitted from this release due to how graphic they are (while I do understand it would be nice to have had them in as some kind of option or dlc).Summary: Truthfully this game may not be as interesting to people who are fans of other hack and slash games but aren't fans of the Berserk manga & even fans may get annoyed at the censorship, story omissions or lack of their favourite characters being playable. I do think the harsh reviews for the game aren't needed, it still holds it's own and it is great fun hacking away hordes of monsters with the dragonslayer. I do feel the game could have done with more content and not covering so many arcs in one game title as at times it did feel rushed as you go through the story. All in all I do recommend people to watch gameplay or give the game a try but not to buy the game at full price unless you are like me and are a sucker for the fact it is part of the Berserk universe."

,Recommended,502280,30085621,Posted: 21 February,all,Gazda,"Should i get Berserk and the Band of the Hawk?Do you like the ""Warriors"" games? Do you like the ""Berserk"" franchise? If you answered both with yes, then get this game. If you know or like only one of them, then you'll probably still want to try it.It runs at 60 FPS and a controller is heavily recommended. No english voices or audio.More details in the review below.I'm a big Berserk and Warriors/Musou fan, so this was a no-brainer for me.(Despite the strange name of the game. There is no one named ""Berserk"", the protagonist is actually named Guts.)Gameplay & StoryTo finally be able to slash through hordes of enemies as Guts is super satisfying and a lot of fun. The port is pretty good and runs flawlessly.I'm not sure if you could decapitate and cut apart enemies in the JP version of the game, but now it's certainly possible.The story is told during the missions and through anime cutscenes, taken straight out of the Golden Age movies. I'm not sure how the cutscenes will look after the ""Golden Age"" Arc.There are ingame-cutscenes after the missions, in which the characters talk to each other and progress the story further. You're able watch ""Events"" between missions, which develop/explain the relationships between characters in more detail.The music is phenomenal and makes slaying enemies even more fun. I think there are soundtracks taken out of the movies aswell and some original compositions. Obviously i didn't hear everything right now, but the first impression is very positive.English TranslationThere are no english voices or audio!All Characters talk in Japanese. Every text is translated, although with a few grammatical errors and typos sprinkled here and there. Nothing too bad, though.Since i'm the kind of person who plays his games with the original japanese voice-actors if possible, it doesn't bother me at all. But if you'd like to understand what people are saying without reading the subtitles, it will be a big no-no for you.How it runs on PCI'm playing with a 360 controller and had no problems. As with other Musou games on PC,a controller is heavily recommended.Graphic quality settings are pretty straight forward:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=869253658Graphics are pretty good for a Musou game and the character models look very detailed and are faithful to the source material. The game runs in 60fps and is super smooth.I'm playing on a 1080p monitor and the resolution option in the graphics setting won't let me go higher than 1080p. 1440p users beware! There is no ""Borderless Window"" option.I will update my review as i progress trough the game."

,Recommended,502280,32828429,Posted: 26 June,all,J'ai Moite,DISCLAMIER: If you plan on buying this game make sure you own a controller of some sort; mouse and keyboard will not work!I have to say that after playing through the entire story that I am very pleased with the game and it was even longer than I expected. There were a few parts of the game that I thought didnt work well such as the horse mechanics but overall the game was solid and a fun experience for the whole 11 to 12 hours of the main story mode. I feel that fans of the series will enjoy this game more than someone who has never read the comics or seen the show due to teh fact that they may get a bit confused due to the fact that the game doesn't tell the story exactly the way the comics and show does. My biggest complaint is the fact that I felt this game was too easy even on one of the harder modes; I only died once in my whole playthough on the seconed hardest difficulty but other than I enjoyed this game as a fan of the series and will eventually go back to 100% it!

No you can't do Guts' taxes, dress him up in my little ponie armor, take him on a spaceship to mine asteroids, or plant stuff in his garden. That's not the point:Big sword => a lot of skulls to crack...It can't be simpler, that's what we call a beat 'em up. In this sort of game, your character goes out on a quest beating up everyone they can find on their path. That is what this game does, and it does so awesomely. The graphics are top notch, the music keeps the pacing and the voice acting and effects are AAA all the way.Of course if you want to play an RPG, this isn't going to cut it. And also this game is about Guts; yes, you can choose other characters but they really don't matter, and are there for flavor only; your main is Guts and that's that.I love this game, I think they made a great work and I think that if you like beat em up games and would love to have glimpses of Berserks story while destroying everything in sight, you'll have a great time like I am. Don't expect top notch AI, multiplayer stuff, or pointless house building... If you feel like thinking, play something else, if you feel like beating everyone up to a pulp, this is great.I highly recommend this as a casual release valve for any work aggroAgain NOT AN RPG, NOT A WORLD BUILDER, AI DOESN""T KNOW HOW TO SOLVE A COMPLEX PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION ON THE SPOT  .. take that into consideration, and you'll have a blast like I amPS I love RPGs, they are probably my favorite genre, but what a boring thing to have all games be the same darn thing."

And I'm not nearly and anime Fan at all. But holy This Series is AMAZING! Clang!The Game is a Hack'n Slash type of Game like Dynasty Warriors. So if you're not a huge Fan of Dynasty Warriors at all, let me get this out of the way, that Game is nothing for you, when it comes to Gameplay.Storywise its top-knoch. Story is getting told via In the Anime Berserk from 1997–1998, but Cutscenes are out of the Movie.You're getting Equipments after every Mission and chests dropping Equipment as well.You can Upgrade your Stuff or Enhance it / Sell it and buy better stuff, like Accessoire's.The Game runs stable at 60 FPS, not Frame-Drops at all.My Specs:i7 4770k @ 3,50ghzGTX 1070 EVGA SC16gb DDR3 RAMKey Bindings are actually pretty decent, not like other Games...It feels so damn good to Slash into Horde's of Enemys with Guts, goddamnit.If you're a Fan of Berserk and you like Dynasty Warrior, GIVE IT A SHOT AND BUY IT!!!You won't regret it. :)And now let me continue to play this wonderful Hack'n Slash BERSERK GAME!!!!"

,Recommended,502280,30437450,Posted: 10 March,all,justAEA,"Before starting this review I want to say that I'm a huge fan of Berserk. I've watched every single anime adaptation and read the manga twice. Hell, I even bought the entire manga. In short, my love for Berserk is like a truck. So naturally I was very excited about this game. I thought Berserk and Warriors would be an excellent combination and I'm happy to say that I was right.For those of you who are not familiar with Warriors games, they are basically hack'n slash games with very simplistic gameplay. You kill hundreds of enemies in each mission. They're not so much about challenge, instead they're about making the player feel like a god. Now, be warned. These games are very divisive and some people find them very boring and repetitive. If you're the kind of person who gets bored quickly, this game may not be for you.So let's talk about this game. It's basically a Warriors clone with a Berserk skin. The story covers 32 volumes of the manga and it took me 20 hours to beat. So the length is very good. Even though the second half of the game feels a little rushed compared to the first half, it was still a lot of fun for me. Visually, game looks pretty good. I really like the cel-shaded graphics, and there are some very nice cgi cutscenes as well. It's a joy to finally see some post-golden age stuff animated (or at least animated well, cough 2016 anime cough). The game has a pretty enjoyable soundtrack as well. I mean it's no Susumu Hirasawa, but I found it enjoyable. Voice acting is good too. They use the same voice actors from the 2016 anime, so that's nice. Also, I must mention that the game has no English voice over, instead it's Japanese audio with English subtitles.There are a total of 8 playable characters in the game. Character selection is a little disappointing because of the number of playable characters and lack of some characters (Skull Knight anyone?). But at least all characters feel different enough, so you don't feel like they are the same characters with different looks. You can use these characters during Free Play mode or the Endless Eclipse mode. Endless Eclipse is kind of like a survival/horde mode, but it also has some roguelite elements in it. Basically you go through layers of Eclipse and try to complete series of missions. You get a checkpoint every 20 layers and if you die, you go back to the previous checkpoint. You unlock new equipment and costumes by beating this mode and It's fun enough to keep you playing for a few extra hours.Now let's talk about some negatives. First and the biggest one is the boss fights. I've been playing games for as long as I can remember but I've never seen more terrible boss fights. They are so bad, they made me question the logic of their inclusion. The game would've been infinitely better without them. Specially that Femto fight. I can write an essay on how broken and annoying that fight is but never mind (I had to beat him 8 ♥♥♥♥ing times!!). Awful hit boxes, bad camera, never ending stun locks, invinsibility frames on bosses (dafuq?) and so on. Apart from that, the game is not a very good port too. A controller is almost mandatory, and the performance is not stable (be sure to set environment quality to low for better performance).So overall, I think Berserk and the Band of the Hawk is a very enjoyable game. If you are a Berserk or Warriors fan, you'll definitely like this game. If you've never played a Warriors game but considering buying this game, check out some gameplay videos and keep in mind that the game tends to get a little repetitive at times. Be sure to check out the manga and thanks for reading my review :)"

It faithfully follows the source material and the gameplay is fast pace and brutal (also like the source material). The main drawback is that like most DW games, it can get repetitive BUT the game conveys, very well, that you are a powerful warrior. You FEEL powerful when playing which is how it is ment to be. When you finish Story Mode, check out Endless Eclipse. It is similar to Endless Tower from Mortal Kombat X in that you keep going for as long as you can and reap the rewards of how challenging it is.Is Berserk and the Band of the Hawk a perfect game? No, however it is definitely fun and I have no regrets getting it!"

76561197997046452,Not Recommended,502280,30745775,Posted: 26 March,all,BitVyper,"I LIKE this game, but it's about twenty dollars more expensive than what I'd say it's worth.Pretty fun early on, but the apostles are incredibly poorly realised.  Dynasy Warriors mechanics are not conducive to pitched boss fights with giant monsters.  They don't fit on the screen, they're so big they trap you in corners and screw up the camera, and their difficulty is purely a function of hitstun and knockback cheese.  Once you're past the golden age arc, a lot of the other Dynasty Warriors mechanics fall apart too; things like base captains and morale and Koei's literally patented unit-density-affects-attack-strength mechanic are all pointless in missions where you're just one guy against an endless horde.I'm not giving it any points for the cutscenes because they're just lifted directly from the anime.  The in-game cutscenes are... absolute garbage.  Problems from two console generations ago, like expressionless faces, and character models just rotating in place when characters turn.  Also frequent crashes and a lot of framerate issues.Here's the thing: It's pretty fun, but like other DW-extant games, the things you like about DW aren't represented nearly as well here as they are in DW.  THAT SAID, in a lot of ways, it does really feel like Berserk, and I had quite a bit of fun playing it.  It's just not worth the price tag."

,Recommended,502280,30188990,Posted: 25 February,all,Pikapool,"Berserk and Band of the Hawk is another IP based from the one of the best manga Berserk. I suggest you read the manga first if you arent familiar with the story, because the story is the strong point in Berserk. This game is a hack and slash like DW series, but with gore. So,you're going to have fun in killing, watching those body parts flying and blood splattered on the ground.Story:Not gonna comment on this one, its good. Read the manga or jump straight to play. I do recommend reading the manga first tho, to know what is what, who is who. Imo, Griffith is a d*ck.Graphic:Graphic is nice, but nothing spectacular, cause its PS4 port. Graphic option is very simple, similar to DW series.Gameplay:I am not gonna comment about the hack and slash part. But there is a frenzy system, which acts like a berserk mode, cause in the manga, whenever Guts angry, he is kinda like go into berserk mode, more powerful. When you are in frenzy mode, everytime you hit enemies, you will fill the deathblow gauge, this is basically the musou attack. Oh, the frenzy is bar is filled by hitting enemies too, the higher your combo goes, the faster it will be. Or you can use items.Items in this game is divided into two, consumables and sub-weapons. Each has its own charges, once it depleted, you have to wait for the cooldown. You can fasten it by getting enemy's drop which shortens the cooldown.Equipmens, equipments is basically accessories and horses, you will get this when you kill enemy general/officer/boss, or you cam buy it in the shop. In the later story, 2 options will be unlocked, Amalgamation and Enhance. Each accessories has its own stats(ATK, DEF, VIT, TECH, etc) and atributes, and one is locked, means it cannot be replaced.Enhance is strengthening one particular atribute using materials with the same color as the atribute. Example: to increase attack atribut, you need to use red material, for defense atribut you have to use brown materials, etc.Amalgamation, this is the real deal, you can combine two accessories to increase the base accessory's stats and atributes. This is the key to make Guts more powerful than he already is.Endless EclipseThis mode is the tower mode in DW. Instead of floors, its called layers. First time you enter this mode, you will have to select one of several desires to complete it, each desire will be completed in 5 layers, so you have to progress layer to layer to complete missions until you reach the 5th layer to complete 1 desire. Its a grindfest, but its fun one, I can see more blood and body parts. Perfect.Behelit:Behelit in the manga is an artifact or a thing used to summon the 4 Gods of hell/darkness. But in this game, behelith is like a sub mission in every stage on story mode, everytime you get one, a section of picture will be revealed in the gallery. Dont worry, they are easy to get, the requirements are straightforward, just play on easy.TLDR, here is a quick pro/con:Pros:- Story- Guts with Berserk Armor, this armor makes Lu Bu like a small kid with anger management. Wearing this armor makes Guts looks bad-fakin♥♥♥♥♥ faster, more powerful, AOE attack, epic deathblow attack, and ofc more blood and limbs scattered.- Skeleton Knight horse, I was hoping he is one of the playable character, but he isnt.At least we got his horse.- Gore, when Guts is in frenzy mode, almost every attack will tear enemy's limbs, charged attack is rekt guaranteed.Cons:- Very few playable characters- No Skeleton Knight- Content wise is not that much, its not worth the current price. Besides story mode and endless eclipse, there is no more things to do.- Camera, god damn the camera, when I fought against the large apostle, sometimes the camera can get too close, so close the only thing I can see is the apostle's body, I was being pummeled till death a few times because of this.- No FOV slider, after playing for 19 hours, its kinda annoying being too close to the character's back, if someone could make the fov slider mod like the one in dragon quest heroes, that would be greatGet this on sale if you are not a fan. If you're a fan, get it now or on sale, its up to you.Update 1: I dont recommend buying this until a patch comes out. The game keeps crashing in Endless Eclipse after finishing 1-2 desires, I tried borderless gaming, setting priority to high on the task manager, updating my driver to the newest one, reinstalling the game, after all those, still getting crash. I will try rolling back to the previous driver, I will update the review after i get the result. Dont buy it, wait for a patch.Update 2: I rolled to the old driver 376.33 to be exact, and the game stop crashing in endless eclipse mode, I just finished the 100th layers just now. So, if you have random crashes, try install the 376.33 driver from NVIDIA website"

Also, the review will most likely change when I completely finish the game.Specs: Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1060Intel Core i5-4690K16 GB RAMGameplay/StorySo first off, never played a Warriors game, but from what I've played so far the game is pretty fun if you enjoy a hack and slash game with hordes of enemies. Story wise, it's just Berserk and there's not much else to say. Though I will add that some things seem slightly edited when it comes to the cinematic footage they used from the films, also the cutscenes done in the game engine aren't really the same as before from what I've seen as of now (which is expected). Another feature that some may be disappointed to hear is missing is online co-op and local co-op.PerformanceFor me it runs at 60 fps with a few minor tweaks. However, some people have been experiencing fps from 45-60 with GTX 1080's. So in this case I'd advise you to maybe wait on a patch if you can't handle fps below 60.RatingPersonally - 10/10 for me, based on my enjoyment and experience thus farIn General - I'd say 9/10 because of the performance issues and 8/10 if you're not a fan of the gameplay.OverallIn the end, I hope this isn't the last Berserk game we'll be getting for a while. My reasons for purchasing it are obviously because it's Berserk, it supports the IP, and that a decent number of sales may hopefully result in more Berserk games in the future that are better in terms of quality (since this is pretty good, but I think we can all agree that Berserk deserves better games for the future).Also don't forget,Griffith did nothing wrong"

,Recommended,502280,30088406,Posted: 21 February,all,Gatsu,"GRIFFIIIIITH !This is a truly AMAZING Berserk game and the best Musou so far, it's also faithful to the anime/manga.Do you enjoy Musou games, like Dynasty Warriors? Then you most likely want to get this.I've been a huge Berserk fan for over 15 years and I had been waiting for a new game for a long time. Last one was from PS2 era. It made me so happy to know that there is a new game coming FINALLY and for Steam omg <(^_^)>!If someone wonders what Berserk is, well it's the most EPIC, emotional and dark stories ever told. An old manga made by Kentaro Miura, which still isn't finished. It tells the tragic journey of Guts, who is on a path of a bloody vengeance towards a character called Griffith. There is a very good reason for his hatred and it is shown to the player. I saw the original anime when I was younger and it was so ♥♥♥♥ing cool and made me read the manga, which is a masterpiece.  This is the thing that inspired my favorite games like Dark Souls for example and many other games/mangas with huge swords.The game runs flawlessly for me so the port is hella good. Pretty much only problem I had at start was that I couldn't get my Xbox1 controller to work, but it can be fixed. I played with keyboard and mouse, which I am not used to with these games, buuuut it works also quite well. There is only Japanese voice acting, which is better than English imo. Also for some reason launching it recommends you to play in WIndows 7 compatibility, which can be switched when you start playing.Story follows the anime/manga in a fantastic way and starts with the Golden Age Arc with younger Guts, showing later how he becomes the Black Swordsman. His character development is incredible. Parts of the story always give the feels... If you aren't familiar with the series at all, I think you can start with this. Because the game also uses a lot of parts from the quite new movie trilogy to progress the story, which is such a cool  thing to do so we can see certain scenes better when it mix like that.No FPS drops, there is awesome music (it's no Susumu Hirasawa quality though), multiple characters to play, equipments to get after completing missions and to upgrade, items to buy, lots of enemies flying around from hits, different combos, more characters unlocks the further you play and fighting can be a bit repetitive as you know from your typical Musou games. Still, this has a different feeling, 'cause it is badass, bloody and Berserk.It feels so cool to swing your sword and beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta of zillion enemies, especially with the Dragonslayer. I recommend this especially to fans. Also it seems that some people have slight problems with the game though, fps drops etc. So if you aren't sure that can you play it well, I guess you can wait for a price drop.I love playing this so much <3 and feels great to experience the journey again...

Clothes ""twitched"" or more like a flicking motion in almost every scene and seems like an easy fix with a patch or something.Story 10/5: Yes, that's right a ten out of five that's how good the story is. It pulls you in wondering what's going to happen next and you might think of what's going to happen but the plot twists and you're stuck there with your jaw dropped. I'm actually going to go into the anime and watch the rest of his story but so far this game alone has a very good story.Overall 9/10: I don't want to give it a full 10 because I feel like there could've been more effort into the animation and gameplay. I only played it on Normal but it felt kinda repetitive since it's the same style as Dynasty Warriors (Biggest difference is you get to slice people in half).

My fears were absolutely demolished, as this game went above and beyond all expectation for me. The fighting feels good, on every character, and the progression of unlocking feels natural and not grindy.When you get the chance to use subweapons, you quickly begin to drip them into your playstyle quite easily, meaning you don't have to worry about micro-managing things on timers all the time.Berserker armour fighting was so good it genuinely made me giggle with joy.The choice of characters was very nice, giving us the option to go back over the story mode with other characters is a very good added bonus, and allows good ""what if?"" scenarios, like what if Griffith wasn't an assbucket and was there to fight alongside guts all this time.All in all: this game is a delightful experience, and I would recommend it to any berserk fan, hell, any hack and slash fan.Enjoy ^-^"

,Recommended,502280,30153487,Posted: 24 February,all,Grand Skeleton Wizard Vincent,"**Spoilers for Berserk included in Review, Read at your own peril**Alright, this is a pretty fantastic game in all regards. I'm a pretty big fan of the Berserk Series and highly anticipated this game for many reasons, but I have some pretty realistic complaints, I like to think. We'll go through this logically, though.First, the positives;- Gameplay is very smooth and responsive - You feel pretty badass cutting through hoards of meatshields as most characters, but Guts especially.- The storyline is generally quite well represented, with the devs not skipping over various important details that Anime and Movie adaptations see fit to completely ignore, but there are still some problems.- Characters can be equipped with various items in a fairly detailed system that increases certain stats, so among the automatic leveling system you can specialize your characters to be superior in certain situations.- The characters that are included in the game are well-made and very well represent who they are in the series; Each character feels like an accurate portrayal in and out of the battlefield.Nitpicky issues / personal gripes- Several sections of the story are handled somewhat directly; For example, The Eclipse is a particularly large disappointment in my eyes, where you get small cutscenes interspiced between re-used assets of future bosses (such as the Snake and Slug apostles..) of fairly obnoxious gameplay where you have to cut down weaker demons before aforementioned apostles can kill you. Also - there's still not a scene of Zodd tossing guts his sword during the section where The Band of the Hawk sieges Doldrey. Somewhat disappointed by that because it's a very characteristic scene - but at least they didn't leave out the Black Hounds or some of the more endearing moments with the Band of the Hawk.- Though it makes sense, most missions in the story have to be played as Guts, but playing as other characters doesn't have a particularly impactful change to the story missions; Guts will be controlled as an NPC and the character you're playing as doesn't appear on the field if they belong there, but your objectives are exactly the same. Different characters served different purposes in the story, but I can understand not going the extra mile - even if there's only 8 total characters.Bold-Faced Negatives- There's only 8 characters. I'm sure you've heard this complaint already, but let me elaborate as to why this is a particularly large injustice. First of all, let's look at another popular Warriors / Musou game; Dynasty Warriors 8. That game features **82** characters; Literally ten times the amount we received in this game. Now, it's completely true that the Dynasty Warriors series has more recognizable characters than Berserk; But our total list is mostly pretty respectable; Guts (of course), Griffith, Casca, Judeau, Nosferatu Zodd, Serpico, and surprisingly, Femto. But wait. You all know what's coming, don't you? Wyald is a playable character in this game. Now; That would normally not be that large of an issue; Wyald plays a significant role as a dangerous antagonist in the series, and is the first Apostle Guts truly defeats, not counting Zodd's swordfight with Guts. BUT; My protests come from the fact that overall, Wyald holds very little impact to the series as a whole, as compared to characters like Skull Knight, Grunbeld, Rosine, Mozgus, and any number of Griffith's really ♥♥♥♥ing cool Apostle army; We get none of them, but we do receive WYALD.I wouldn't be so salty about this if there weren't lovingly rendered models for almost all of the c haracters I mentioned, and I'd be even less salty if Wyald wasn't so vigorously shoved in your face. In the story, you have to kill him somewhere around six times at minimum, which is fine because combo spamming makes other humanoid entities in this game a joke; But every ♥♥♥♥ing time he has a snide comment about his 'return' to really drive it in that Skull Knight or Mozgus isn't playable. ""By *popular demand*, I return!""So, to end; Yes, I absolutely reccomend this game. It's a well-made nod to the series of Berserk that had a lot of love and care into it, and it shows. But I can only pray for DLC characters so that I can have a TRUE Berserk game."

I can remember more than a couple of errors-very repetitive. not enough combos and moves in general. I'd like to see the combat more thoroughly fleshed out to make it take more skill-boss fights can range from tedious to outright frustrating. It can be a fight in itself to get over how boring they can end up. the eclipse fight with femto was expecially bad. slowing mechanics are not fun or interesting game design. I understand what they were going for but it falls flat. It's hard to design a fight based around something the protagonist in the source material had no chance of beating (at least at the time)-dlc skins. didn't bother myself-I've crashed 2 times in 8 hours. I guess that is okay. I had to repeat 2 missions though.I love Berserk. It's a shame that the new anime is going to turn off a lot of people.

There aren't any options to change this. This isn't something specific to this game, it's quite common among ports.  Sad.Goodstory/lore- it follows the manga/anime pretty well.  It does feel a bit padded out at times but all the characters are there, even the ones that anime missed.Skills system! - I really really liked the accessories-skills system.  You gradually get familiar with the accessories and stats, you're then taught the enhancement system, then the amalgamation and finally the skill transfer.  I thought it was a great way of progressing.  The buy/sell is simple and straightforward.Theanimation- the story covers the 1997 series  and the 2016 continuation, so you get a mix of 2D, 3D and what appear to be remastered scenes from the original anime.  Based on the reviews I thought the game would look fantastic,  but IMO the current anime looks better.  The game's animation itself is... alright.  Some of the facial expressions look a bit hilarious especially when someone is angry and they simply bare their teeth and hold it there for an eternity.Thegameplay- it's supposedly a hack-and-slash, sort of, but not really.  A lot of the enemies just tend to stand around waiting for you to hit them.  Some scenarios tend to be there for no reason and it can get quite repetitive at times.  If you're looking at this for a hack-and-slash, I suggest going somewhere else.  You can also play as some of the other characters (Casca and Zodd are pretty good) but it's mostly as free mode.

,Not Recommended,502280,34054424,Posted: 6 August,all,Carmony,"I love the Musou formula and even I think this game is shallow and repetitive.Look to Pirate Warriors or Hyrule Warriors to see how these fanservice crossovers should be done. Not here.This game boasts a whopping EIGHT CHARACTERS, and they are not well picked. If you're excited to play some cool secondary character that you like then give that up. If it's not Zodd, Wyald, Serpico or Schierke you're screwed. Did you expect Skull Knight (who is of course fully modeled in game) or Farnese or Isidro? Maybe some of the Neo Band of the Hawk? Judeau's in though.The combat revolves entirely around getting into your Musou Mode and then charging a second gauge for your big attack so you can mow through the same four kinds of enemies on the same few stages. Smattered in between there though are annoying fights with super armored large bosses where victory feels more like outgaming the system than overcoming an adversary. Story Mode allows you to play someone other than Guts maybe two to three times total so you better like the big slow heavy hitting types. I compared it to being only able to play Keiji Maeda in Sengoku.Dragon Quest Heroes was a better Musou game and it was actually a Tower Defense."
,Recommended,502280,33387201,Posted: 8 July,all,SotiCoto,"I'll start by saying I'd give this game a 6/10.That is just above average, so I'd still recommend playing it, but compared to other Koei-Tecmo games the gameplay is kinda lacking. Not many characters, and at least one character slot is wasted on Wyald, who doesn't deserve a character slot in any game.  The localised equivalent of the musou attack now has two layers to it for added nuisance factor, and necessitating more fiddly nonsense in order to get that lovely AoE attack of doom. Oh yeah, and expect to redo the Endless Eclipse all the way to the 100th level with EVERY character if you want those cheevos.Still... we don't get enough good Berserk games, and it does that reasonably well, even if it does skip the entire Lost Children of Misty Valley arc  (apparently the latest anime / CG adaptation skips it too though).  Apparently even if the children are mutated into little bug-fairy things, a lot of folks still don't approve of them being burnt, splatted, sliced apart and.... well, they kill and r4pe each other too, which is kinda funny. But no, we don't get those in the game. Instead we get playable Wyald, who has been made goofy. Remember him? The guy who was chasing down the Band of the Hawk with dismembered bodyparts of people who had helped them on spikes to provoke a reaction?  Serial r4pist, murderer, torturer, kills his own men... THAT Wyald. Has a very brief appearance in the manga just before the eclipse and is killed off by Zodd. Dude is nasty. So nasty even other demons hate him. This game treats him like a comedy character... but it still skips out the entire Lost Children of Misty Valley arc. Typical.READ THE MANGA, FOLKS.But anyway... yeah.  This game kinda disappointed me... but then it is still entertaining for a while. Good filler between other, better musou games maybe. Definitely better than wasting your time on all the Visual Novels Steam spams on a regular basis."

,Recommended,502280,30155237,Posted: 24 February,all,Theran,"I should start off by saying, if you haven't watched the anime, or read the Manga, you should do that first. The game is going to have massive spoilers you can't avoid. If you just want this style of gameplay, I'd suggest just going for another one of the Warriors games.TL;DR It's Berserk + Dynasty Warriors. What more could you want?I absolutely love this game, but that may be because I love Berserk. It's hands down one of my favorite Anime/Mangas. I'm not however very well versed in the Dynasty Warrior style games, the only one I've ever played was Hyrule Warriors on the Wii U. So far this one seems to be up to the par that one set!This is probably a half finished mess, but I'll try to explain some stuff.------------Story------------I haven't gotten far enough in the story yet to full judge this, but from what i've played so far, it follows the Golden Age Arc pretty faithfully, which is a huge plus. It's one of the more interesting and engaging stories I've seen before, and I don't at all mind playing through it, or watching it for the 100th time! Will probably update this part later.------------Mechanics------------The gameplay is solid, it follows almost all the same styles as hyrule warriors, you can dodge cancel out of heavy attacks to speed progress, you can cut down swathes of enemies with almost zero effort (the berserk way!), and the equipment system is very solid from what I've seen. While it seems like it's really simple, and you just hack your way through things, if you want to complete challenges you have to use time saving techniques and tricks.Horses were added to this as well, which allow for even faster movement throughout the battlefield, which is something I've wanted in Hyrule Warriors.The equipment system while not as robust as some of the one in hyrule warriors, which as weapons of varying degrees of power, I can see why they opted for an accessory system instead, it allows the characters to use their iconic weapons.------------Characters------------They're characters from berserk, they start off happy, and end up sad. Playing as some of my favorite characters though is great, I love Judeau and having the oppurtunity to play as him is great! I don't yet know how full the roster is going to be, but I'm really looking forward to playing them all.Each character I've played has really felt like them. Guts has large sweeping attacks and slow charge attacks, Shierke has ranged and AOE magic effects. They don't really feel the same, and that's great.------------Voice Acting------------Sad that they didn't get the English voice actors from the anime, I know I know dubs and all that, but they are iconic, and very well done for a dub. I think it would be a lot more enjoyable, and better for new people to the series to not have to deal with a langage barrier.------------Pretty Graphic Stuff------------If you are not a fan of♥♥♥♥♥♥portrayed in media, or the shear amount of blood an gore, stay away from this game, and probably the series.------------Cut Scenes------------I feel this might be one of the weaker parts, it feels like they just took  movie clips from the Golden Age Arc movies, which has a different style than the in game parts a lot of the time. It really breaks it. Other times it's a non 3d style, usually with close ups of just faces. It's a bit strange they chose to to that."

76561198071439298,Recommended,502280,30089744,Posted: 21 February,all,Okies,"I think this will be my first review of any game on Steam, or at least one of the very few I do.How to start... Since this game is released at the same time as the console counterparts, I don't think of this as a regular port, so the game mechanics seems to be working without any problems for me, just make sure you have a computer who can run it with decent specs.Right, that out of the way... First a few things.I am a Koei Temco fan since their first 3 Kingdoms games, Uncharted Waters series, and lastly their Dynasty series. And also I'm a HUGE Berserk fan. I read the manga even before it was made into an anime, and the fact that they use the original voice actors in the game is a nice nostalgic touch to me. And Koei DOES a good job in implementing their Dynasty engine within the Berserk story, also it seems the game follows the books and not the anime, for those who doesn't know the difference, the anime has certain elements cut off and made shorter, so seeing Puck at the loading screen filled me with a small grin to be honest.That aside.... I wish I could praise the game a whole lot more, however I may have had too much expectations for the game, but don't get me wrong, it's a good game by itself. However as stated earlier, this game follows the Dynasty hack and slash gameplay and level up system, which can be kinda repetative if you played a lot of their games sadly. But this shouldn't discourage any fans of the Dynasty series to not try it out, because it IS indeed worth it... if you like the Dynasty gameplay and am a Berserk fan, or even to those new tot he series.So why my overhyped expectations you may ask? Well some may not know this, but there was a previous Berserk game released on the PS2 years ago only in the Japanese market. I got an import copy of the game and I have to kinda say.... The game play in the ancient PS2 game... is infact better, and that was the system I had hope of being renewed.In this game I've just defeated Zodd to make sure they are different before makign this review, and yes it is vastly different. You can YouTube the gameplay for the PS2 to see the Zodd fight there.While this game you just need to hack away at the enemy while keeping an eye on your health and you'll be golden. While the PS2 game was.... how to say.... more 'dynamic'? During a fight in the PS2 version you could trigger certain combos not usually available for massive damage if you fullfilled certain requirements. Like with Zodd you'd both attack which would end up in a deadlock parry which I've not seen in the recent Dynasty games when I think of it. That aside, in the PS2 version, once in a deadlock, you could press a button to make Guts climb up on Zodd to fire his hand canon into Zodd's mouth mor massive damage. And this wasn't only on boss fights, but regular fights as well, and I just kinda miss that and half expected that to return as I haven't seen any other games like that come out of Japan.Also the leveling system in the PS2 was better. Here you just level up as in the Dynasty series, and while that isn't bad.... I just expected more. In the PS2 you got stat points you'd invest as in other RPG games that not only would increase various stats, but also Gut's swing speed which I haven't seen in this game, and also various power ups would change Gut's stance, walk speed, and attack speed. all which I thought was better in the old game, and don't get me started on the Berserker armor, but I'm not that far in the current game, so if things change, I might have to edit my current review.Bottom line... Great Dynasty style Berserk game, but if like me, you have played the older game, you might get a bit dissapointed. And I just wished that Koei actually took a few of their guys to play the old game before they started making this."

,Recommended,502280,30112290,Posted: 22 February,all,Vitamin ω «Expired Tomato»,"BERSERK and the Band of the Hawk is the latest incredible adaptation of the BERSERK manga. Based on the seminal side project of iDOLM@STER producer Kentaro Miura, which he works on during his spare time, BERSERK and the Band of the Hawk is a compilation of the three Golden Age Arc movies, as well as new material extending to the Falcon of the Millennium Empire arc. I'm perplexed by strange decisions made for this compilation, such as the decision to excise much of the character development of the Golden Age Arc movies while stiching them together, or the amusing interactive portions that this movie favors, where you can take control of Guts and a few other characters in key battles that were originally presented in animated format. It's an interesting decision to say the least, although the interactive portions are well put together, they can catch you unaware if you aren't prepared.The stiching togther of the three Golden Age Arc films can be a bit jarring, but overall the movie is solid, and this is the only place you can experience the other arcs on Steam. The full Golden Age Arc trilogy is also available on Steam for four bucks each, which makes this movie a great companion piece to the excellent trilogy. Just be prepared to take control every once in a while."

It looks and and feels good, but when it comes to the boss fights, the game makes me so mad that it ruins the whole game.I havent died to any of the bosses so its not the fact that im just bad. Its the fact that the boss fights are just thought out so poorly and are just terrible. The fact u cant stagger the bosses and in alot of cases they spam moves where they become invulnerable so u cant even deal damage to them is just disgusting. Add in the fact that when u dodge the moves still hit u just makes the whole meaning of having a dodge move pointless and blocking is just asking to get hit because your gaurd breaks straight away. the boss fights are just massive immovable meat slabs that u just having slowly wittle away at until it dies. the fact that its such a simple thing that could of been changed makes the game feel lazy and rushed and overall just a money grab from fans who have been long awaiting for something like this.TLDR: main gameplay fun, 'boss' fights ruin the whole experience."

Though I havent beaten the game yet I can with confidence say they've done the golden age arc so much justice in just the couple of hours I've played helping me build a bond with these characters all over again.

It's quite a must have for BERSERK fans, animations are nice, it captures the art style, combat is pretty fun and new attacks and abilities are unlocked down the line so you're not just pressing the same buttons over and over. Designed so it's not a 'Beat the Story and it's over game.' There's a lot of equipment, characters, horses, abilties and outfits to unlock while have a whole butload of Behelits to find to fill the gallery. Most of this stuff can be found in the 'Endless Eclipse' mode which should be played after you beat the story mode which as the title suggests infite missions as you go lower and lower down the abyss to floor 100 where a boss will await. By floor 100 you will have unlocked everything the character has left to unlock too. But you can still go further than floor 100 if you wish.My only complaint are bosses aren't well designed. They do not flinch so when you attack they can attack you and send you flying. There's about a half a second end-lag between moves so unless you use a special you can only get 2 hits in depending on which character you play before you have to run away from the enemies attack. And while being this awkward the enemies have multiple health bars so unless you ultilize your death gauge it will take 10 minutes to kill. AND THIS IS FOR EVERY APOSTLE IN THE GAME."

Для меня - эта игра , лишний раз вспомнить чем же так замечателен был берсерк в арке золотого века и пустить такую солененькую , крепкую мужскую слезу на её окончание с криком- "" Что ты ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ наделал , Гриффит!?"". Ну а тем кто достаточо терпелив или же просто пришлось по вкусу геймплей прямиком из Musou игр ( руби врагов пока у тебя припадочные состояния не начнутся или ты не выполнишь все задания на карте) , то вы ,мой друг, рискуете лицезреть игровую интерпретацию берсерка 2016 года, и тут, я удивился. Сюжет не такой стремительный как в аниме, но как в манге - все по полочкам. Насколько я понял, далее по сюжету идет арка ""Ястреб тысячелетней империи"" миную арку ""Возмездие"", а жаль. Лутовые поля и бесконечные залежи материалов здесь вам обеспечены, ибо в линейке Dynasty Warriors так модно, но не отчаивайтесь - шмотизм не так сильно влияет на процесс игры, в лучшем случае дает полезные пассивки, улучшающие тот или иной показатель персонажа. Ууу, а персонажей здесь , как по мне достаточно (9 играбельных) и все , разумеется, с разными способностями и костюмами. Самый важный минус для меня - это музыка.  Ost Susumi Hirasawa лежит где-то за бортом хорошей интерпретации по берсерку в игровой вселенной, и это очень меняет тон событий и самих битв. Могу ли я порекомендовать игру тем , кто не знаком с берсерком -  и да и нет, довольно много знаковых вещей , описывающих тех или иных персонажей и их мотивы упущены. Фанатам берсерка - и да и нет, геймплей данного рода игр не всем приходится по вкусу.9 GRIFFIIIIIITHS /10"

,Recommended,502280,30982391,Posted: 6 April,all,Gazellen,"The gameplay is fast, fun and a never ending stream of enemies to kill, pretty fitting as a Berserk game. The most annoying aspect of the gameplay is getting stunlocked by either spears or heavy and fast hitting bosses into a corner with no chance to act.The story is an alright adaptation of the manga and pretty much on point for the most part. Though they do skip several parts in the story they could have well adapted into the game, but I do think that's because there is nudity and controversy in those parts of the story. Why they thought it necessary to censor out those parts still dumbfound me. Because the people who buy and play this game is probably going to be Berserk fans, and with that they already have seen those scenes before, so to censor it only takes away from the experience. There is also some grammar errors here and there but nothing too distracting.The conecept of unlocking playable characters, skins and other items from the manga is also very fun and gives you a reason to continue playing even after you're done with the story mode. It can get repetitive but changing your character will keep the gameplay interesting enough if you enjoy the core gameplay, which is to hack, slash and smash hordes of enemies.On a low note, the game crashes, a lot. It is very frustrating when you have come a good bit in the ""Endless Abyss"" mode, basically a mode where you keep playing missions without being able to save the progress except on determined levels, and then the game crashing resulting in you losing all your progress.If they would come out with an update and fix the crashes it would greatly enhance the experience."

There are 8 characters in total to play as which is a small but good selection. My only gripe is why is Wyald a playable character? When they were making this game did they think; ""Hmmm; who will Berserk fans really want to play as? How about that giant r@pist dog guy Wyald?""

,Recommended,502280,30096880,Posted: 22 February,all,McLovinz ʕಠᴥಠʔ,"Some of the most fun I've had with a 'Warriors' title besides playing Dynasty Warriors 4 on the PS2 as a lil' boy. I say that because the only others i've touched were DW3, GW, and DW7.Story:Is awesome; it's ♥♥♥♥in' Berserk!It skips over quite a few subjectively minor details like Casca's period, Casca's♥♥♥♥♥♥ boobs, and even blotches out scenes like Corkus and Pippin dying. Not particularily integral scenes to the story, but I can see why people might get upset at the censorship (albeit they had to, to avoid AO rating on a niche game that probably wasn't going to do financially well anyway).Gameplay:The gameplay is actually really great. It's addicting to run into a crowd of 100 people with my rage-o-meter charged and just slice people to bits. The sound design and the visuals of doing so are just so right that it scratches an itch everytime. My only complaint is that you practically just spam a list of 5 combos and some offshoots of them for every single fight in the game (as guts at least; Zodd when I played him for a few minutes had some slightly different button combos). It gets tedious and tires your fingers a little, but that brings me to the next point.Costumes are a thing in this game, and they aren't just visual; they change your character's gameplay, albeit not too much. As you progress through the story as Guts, you get all of his armor, his gimps, and yes, even his badass weapons. The Dragonslayer is quite a bit different to use than the greatsword, and rightly so. It was such a refreshment to move on to the Conviction Arc with a bunch of new things to use. You also get Guts' handcannon and his crossbow; perfect for crowd control, and you eventually get to unlock the Berserker Armor, along with Berserker Rage, which is devastating compared to anything else in the game.Length-wise, i'm 6 hours in and at the start of the Black Swordsman Arc (or rather, right after the Golden Age Arc), and right before the Conviction Arc. That's pretty damn good, and as far as I am aware of, it goes all the way to the end of the Falcon of the Millenium Arc (yes, including the Berserker Armor). So if you want to play the game only to play strictly the story, it will last you roughly 12-15 hours. Might be too little for $60, but it also includes a 100 Layer Endless Eclipse Mode that you can play through as 8 different characters, all with different goals and special unlocks for beating it.Modes:There's two of 'em, and they are Free Play (which speaks for itself), and Endless Eclipse, a 100-Layer thick survival mode, where you go from level to level endlessly cutting down baddies and doing small sidequests, each layer harder than the last (even if slightly). I played through Zodd on my first 10 layers, and I must say it was rather fun if you want to mindlessly hack'n'slash in the Eclipse world.Actual Problems:The few problems worth noting are the lack of KB/M support (which I had absolutely no problem with, for I own a XBO controller and a Steam Controller; both working great on this), which I can see as being a deal breaker for some, and the lack of English Dub, which I can understand for the last half of the game, but I wouldn't mind if the first half had an optional ""Ayy you can listen to the most in-depth part of the story in English, but later on it swaps over to Japanese, you OK with this, or just want to stick with subtitles?"". It gets rather annoying looking down while fighting to see what the hell anyone is even saying.Overall, it's a solid 8/10 from me for sure.The TL;DR for ya':""A very satisfying game with large battles, yet ever so slightly repetitive hack-n-slash combat, with the two problems most common in Japanese games released in the West."""

,Not Recommended,502280,30621818,Posted: 19 March,all,AstartesRookie,"***Update as of 28 March 2017***I've since completed the game. My opinion has changed somewhat. I will add that I was pleasantly surprised by how much else there was that kept to the spirit of the manga. Including the fight before the infamous boat.That being said, being honest I enjoyed the game. They've achieved the task of making this a hack and slash with a story.  However, I implore those who do get into this, to absolutely read the manga and/or watch the OVAs. They are the only mediums that are as close to the original work (or are the original work) as possible.  Learning Japanese is probably the only way to avoid situations like this and many others.**Original Review**It's unfortunate that this game, besides it's efforts to avoid getting an AO rating, still managed to censor out some the more critical parts of the story.  For those that haven't played the game, this will have spoilers so**SPOILER ALERT**While an argument can be made that the story is still told in a way that moves it forward, there are memorable scenes among Berserk fans that give the story the impact. It's lke if your house is destroyed. You know the damage - it's destroyed, but you don't know exactly what hit it or the size. That's what it feels like. I'll touch up on the already spoken about examples.-Sexual censorshipAmong noticible examples such as the Eclipse scene and Casca's 'assult' as they put it. If you're not a Berserk fan, it's implied that he maybe touched her or had sex with her. He could have been like the facehugger in aliens and impregnated her that way. You still don't know. All you know is that she's now in shock. For Berserk fans, you absolutely know what happened there. It was♥♥♥♥♥♥ and for Guts there was no looking away. For Griffith, it was a show of dominance and a testament to Guts, his 'friend'. It was like he said 'You took everything from me when you left that day. You made me lose focus on my dream. Now I'll take away everything from you'. The look in his eyes through it all, Griffith knew. So now you're leading around a Casca that was mentally and physically damaged. Guts has also suffered shock through it all from this incident. His friends killed. Someone he grew very close to, taken advantage of in the worse way, and someone he thought was his best friend at the core of it all. Not to mention he loses an arm. You have to ask yourself, if you saw this, how would you feel? How would you have reacted? Well, go watch the blu-ray of the anime because that's the only way you'll see that. They basically took scenes from the anime and inserted them into this anyway.-Gore CensorshipAnother scene that loses it's impact is the fight between Guts as 'The Black Swordsman' and the 'snake' apostle. It's a memorable scene to Berserk fans because shows Guts absolute ruthlessness. He shows no humility in this fight and how far he's willing to go. In the original animation he gets overwhelmed by the apostle while fighting him, in what looks like genuine fear. Only to surprise the apostle with a literal hand cannon, damaging a good portion of his face. He then brings his sword across the snakes body, chopping him in half.  After this, he has his brief conversation with the apostle, then begins firing arrows into his face. Slowly. As it screams to it's death. Guts is a dark hero and he will do whatever is required to be strong. Even if it means sacrificing his humanity, in order to defeat Griffith.I hope to add more to this but many have already spoken about it, including those on Sankaku who will continue to say fans ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan about why the game was censored. It's not just about seeing♥♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥ There's purpose to each of these scenes and they give impact to the delivery of the story. Without those, it loses it's edge and what made it such a mature dark fantasy comic to begin with.It's also not without it's other mechanic issues such as unknown timeframes for missions. There are multiple stages where in order to obtain a behelit, you're required to complete a task within a certain time frame. Well, you're never given the specific timeframe. I'm not sure if I'm just new to the Dynasty Warrior type series, but it's hard to meet a deadline if you don't know what the deadline is. You just end up doing the stage multiple times, faster and faster until you get it - which can add increased difficulty if you have to deal with bosses on that stage. It's not like you can get the behilit and quit - you have to complete the stage to ensure completion.   I've run into this issue on the following stages so far:- The Golden Age- The Battle for Doldrey- Infiltrating Windham- The Eclipse- Vow of Retaliation- The Brand's GuidanceI'm sure there will be more before I finish the game.It's unfortunate that I wanted to support this game. I got this game very close to release in an effort to support the company and it's effort to get it over here in the west. However they single-handedly managed to upset both sides of the world, which in unfortunate because besides it's issues with missing information, it's a decent game overall. This isn't a complete critique of the game. It's a gripe. I'm a big fan of Miura's work in the original movie animations, the new animation (despite criticism of the CG), and the comics. It's a hard sell if left untouched to those that aren't fans of the work and they're trying to reach out to those who haven't watched the series. In turn, they alientate their current fans a bit to widen their audience to gain money. This will allow them to increase their efforts to churn more works out from their company.Well, to those who purchased the game and enjoyed it, good for you and I hope you continue to support the company and their cause.For those, like myself, who feel slighted that Miura's work was displayed in this manner and unable to experience the work in this medium the way you might have imagined, I'd suggest no longer showing your support. Write your letters to the company and coordinate with parent companies in Japan to express your disappointment.  Of course, they (among others) may feel that nothing of importance was lost because you're just a disappointed customer. Their goal was not you, it was your dollar and regardless of how you feel, they were paid.  There are those that are happy with the way the game came out and that shows in it's ""Very Positive"" rating on Steam as of 03/19/2017. So what's your point?I think it would have just been better to release an uncut and general audience version of the game. Pay a little more and experience the work the way it was meant - gore, sex and all. Enough of whatever this is."

,Recommended,502280,31808842,Posted: 17 May,all,Skjegget til Lars,"Berserk and the Band of the Hawk can be described as Dynasty Warriors with the setting, characters, and stories from Kentaro Miura's ""Berserk"" manga series. You run around open levels, bashing the living hell out of hordes of enemies, leveling up your character, collecting items, and gathering gold in order to buy items, all in order to increase your characters stats.In addition to the typical Musou/ Dynasty Warriors levels, where you run a round a somewhat open area beating up dudes, Berserk also boasts a mode called ""Endless Abyss"", where you fight your way through levels, completing challenges and gaining gold as you progress further down the abyss. The further down you get, the more difficult the fights become, but the rewards also become better, giving you more money and better items. This mode is giving a rogue-lite spin by integrating perma-death, meaning that if you die, you will have to go back to the start and try again (unless you have passed a threshold level, in wich case you can start from that level.)If you like Dynasty Warriors, you will probably enjoy this game. The gameplay is a bit mindless and button-mashy, but sometimes that's just fine in my opinion. If, like me, you love the source material, you will also find som enjoyment in playing as Guts, Griffith, Judeau, Scorpio, and a handfull of other characters from the Berserk universe. The characters feel distinct, and they fight like you'd imagine they'd fight (I.E, Guts is somewhat slow with his swings but hits like a truck, Griffith is lightning fast with his rapier, and so on). Fans may also find some enjoyment in the in-game glossary (giving some backround information about the universe of Berserk), gallery, cut-scenes from the movies, and the stories taken straight from the manga (specifically, it starts with The Black Swordsman arc, and ends with the infamous boat).If you don't like Dynasty Warriors or Berserk, you can safely stay away, however. This game will not change your mind on either. For the fans however, it is a pretty good time.Summary:+ Simple gameplay, easy to pick up and play+ The playable characters feel distinct and play like you would expect them to+ Follows the manga quite closely+ Decent, if not great, fan service+ Endless abyss mode puts a rogue-lite spin on the Dynasty Warriors formula, a welcome breath of fresh air in an otherwise repetetive game+ The best looking Musou/Dynasty Warriors game to date- The gameplay can be a little TOO simple, and the game is very easy on the default difficulty- As previously stated, the game gets a repetetive after a while- The optimization isn't great. It runs fine, but will dipp soewhat during the most extreme brawls- Would have liked to see more playable characters, like Skull Knight (you can ride his horse but not play as him?)"

(cough) adult content... in the berserk game but thats only a negative if your a fan of the series.the positives far out number the negatives as its a long game not 4 hours it took me a little over 10 hours to beat on the easy mode and its much harder and longer on higher difficultys (thou its mostly just repetivie but fun to overpower the bad guy missions) but the fun part comes when you get to the endless eclips game mode where you can fight waves of monsters with a optional objective to get better items where if you beat a certain number of waves it literaly rewards you with amazing things such as infinite berserk armor and more. as i said the missions are repetive but the reward is great and the story is done well. you can also play as most of the main charachters in the story and get alt costumes that make you look cool or just to laugh at.this game for me gets a 7/10 good game"

I only have two complaints - the ending will likely leave you somewhat unsatified, granted it catches up with the manga very well for a video game. Also I think there definitely needs to be more playable characters. The fact there is already DLC and it's kind of expensive doesn't sit well with me. All i'm saying is that i better not have to pay $15 to play as the Skeleton Knight. FR. Pls gaem mekers. Overall it's very fun and very addicting with those points aside. It runs easily on my 660 graphics card which is rare for new games and i feel like finally berserk was given a decent game!griffith did nothing wrong"

As someone who is a fan of the button masher kind of games like this I prepared for a degree of repedativeness. This I could not tollerate though. If you are just interested in experiencing the Berserk story then this is a great wat to experience it. Is it worth the price point, absolutely not. On 50 -75% off, sure. The lack of depth in the game play is what killed it for me. Everything you see happening in the game play videos; you do that, you do that the entire game, over and over."

I think a little more effort would've made this a perfect game, it has a strong base gameplay but it feels incomplete. The PS2 version has 2 hours worth of ingame cutscenes, while this has only 30 minutes. The rest was taken from the anime, but the anime only covers up until the eclipse, this game goes two arcs after that. Maybe they're waiting for the new anime to be finilized before they included it as a DLC? I would definitely pay for any DLC included in my Cons, so crossing my fingers. As is this game is a solid 7/10, it's still a fun game and worth owning, but I would wait for the price to drop. I don't think you need to be a Berserk fan to enjoy this game since most fans are spoiled (myself included), I think newcomers can enjoy this game all the same!"

Performance on a i7-4790/16gb/1tb-ssd/980-ti,  was great even with like 200 dudes on screen.Music and sound effects are amazing, plus it comes with pretty much a movie worth of the 2011 remake.I never felt that I was being unfairly punished and I earned each loss.

For an exemple: bonus stats on items are stated as ""strengh bonus lvl5"". Can't you just tell me how much strengh it gives?! I don't care about the bonus level, give me actual values!Despite interface issues, the gear part of the game is quite interesting though.And to conclude, beheliths (items you earn but completing special objectives during missions) only unlock pieces of artworks. It already felt disappointing to me that the reward is something that don't improve/change my game experience (and that i can have in 2 clicks on the internet), but even more frustrating, you need like 20 beheliths to unlock 1 full artwork and you can hardly earn 3 per mission, making the beheliths system totally worthless.In the end, i didn't felt like playing a really bad game, but more like playing a below-average game that i paid way, WAY too much for.15-20 would be the price it actually deserve imo"

But for Berserk, I was still getting stuttering and lag with the lowest settings and 600x400 resolution.In short, wait until this game is patched.

That being said, YOU NEED TO READ THE ♥♥♥♥ING MANGA IN ORDER TO FULLY ENJOY THE IN GAME STORY! I feel Omega Force greatly marginalized its audience by having one pf the biggest events in the series featured IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING OPENING CUTSCENE!Alright, onto the game: WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?!A little extreme, but come on!? THE MAX RESOLUTION IS 720p! I don't know if no one else has this issue, but my friend and I both bought it and we have this issue. Alongside this, the options are very, very simplistic and I've had the issue of having to make the game fullscreen by going through the in game menu, because if you set it to fullscreen in the out of client options menu it becomes borderless windowed in a 4:3 aspect ratio! Really!?The cutscenes for the entirety of the Golden Age arc are shamelessly stolen from the movies, which is annoying because when I pay $60 for a game I expect real effort to be put into it.And that really sums up my views on the game: it feels like there's a serious lack of effort. It looks like an Xbox 360 game from 2009, and feels like it too. I will say that the gameplay can be fun, because the Warriors series is definitely the best way to adapt Berserk into a game, and the berserk modes are really fun to use, especially since it gets stronger every time you use it, but I just expected more. I played some of Hyrule Warriors, and it left a really good impression, but this just left a bad taste in my mouth.I will say that this game has its moments, like your first encounter with Zodd's big♥♥♥♥♥apostle form really made me feel the same panic I imagine Guts did when he charged at me. I also appreciate that they tried to add in all the dialogues between characters, but that's about it.If Omega Force can give this game some proper resolutions and possibly add co-op then I'll happily return to this review and reccommend it, but as of now I'd reccommend a friend to spend their money on a better game, like For Honor."

For me, it was obvious that it wasn't for me in under 2 hours (thankfully).The problem with this game is that it doesn't even feel like yet another slightly-tweaked Warriors clone. Yes, you read that right. Because all I expected from this game was that it would turn out to be either an entirely reconsidered Warriors clone or one that was at least true to the Warriors concept. I mean I would be fine, if I could at least get the Warriors experience. As other people also noted, most mechanics (like base captains) seem to have been deconstructed and left that way. They are simply meaningless and incompatible.The really annoying fps issues are just the icing on the cake (or the feather on the manure pile, as one certain idiom says). I don't know if this was ever fixed or patched, as I got a refund, but it's unacceptable.And what is with all that loading? Every little event comes with a long loading sequence that is frankly enough to make you want to just throw that controller/mouse-keyboard away and do something else instead of wasting your time.Sure, it seems that Berserk fans are thrilled anyway, but not me. I am sorry Koei. I believe you failed with this one.Just remember, especially if you aren't an avid fan of the manga/anime and if you are expecting at least a decent Warriors clone, you are going to be disappointed. In case you still want to try despite that, I recommend waiting until it gets a discount (a hefty one hopefully).One final recommendation: Just skip all those cutscenes. As I mentioned before, the loading times are already unreasonably long. You wouldn't want to waste more of your 2-hour trial time with the cutscenes. Make sure you actually like what they did with the game and that you will keep it first. Then it's always possible for you to go back and see the cutscenes for your viewing pleasure."

The manga constantly go on hiatus, the newest anime is badly done, and one of the few games that they get of the franchise is not good. This game is not changing that anytime soon. The main problem with this game is that it doesn't capture the spirit of the franchise. The main points of Berserk is not the over the top action. The point is the following the continuing struggles of Guts and how he interacts with other characters. Berserk is a more somber series. So it's not a good thing that this game have little interaction between the characters and cut out major plot points. And what is really annoying for the begging half of the game they use scenes cut from the BERSERK: The Golden Age Arc movies. That is so lazy. But even if you ignore the series that the game is based on you will find that this game is a chore to get through. I guess I should have expected this with a Musou type game but this game seems more repetitive than a usual Musou. Each mission usually boiled down to kill the generals. Even though you can take over bases the game never expects you to do it. Even though their a multiple playable characters you will mostly chose berserk armor Guts as he is far more useful. This game just fails to be a good Berserk game. All fans of the series should avoid this game."

,Recommended,502280,30384650,Posted: 7 March,all,marv,"Berserk and the Band of the Hawk is a strange case of having enough moving parts to be a good game, but fail in being great at the exact genre its implementing, which is being a Musou. The simplest way I can explain how Berserk Warriors flows between passing and failing this bar to people who neither know Berserk nor those that enjoy Dynasty Warriors and its various incarnations is that there are three fundamental aspects of this game genre; good variety of enemy types which you will potentially butcher in the millions, good variety of locations and/or mission to kill them in and a lot of characters to play as. Well, as much as you can argue about whether this game succeeds in the first two, the third is one of this game's great failures with a paltry pick of just 8 characters -- even with the caveat that some of those characters have several costumes that can offer more powerful variations and transformations of said character. And this is all the more strange when many characters are not only in this game, but given their own specific move sets and specials!Pieces that, if you look in a certain way, could be laying foundation for a sequel musou that would improve vastly on the groundwork Band of the Hawk laid, which from what they released, may not be a gamble that pays off.However; even with this fatal crack in the blade, somehow, Berserk and the Awkward Name struggles on to somehow be entertaining and it is still puzzling trying to figure out objectively why this is for me personally. The attention to detail from both the perspective of the Golden Age Films and the actual original story of Berserk is all over the place. While the first part of the game tries its hardest to hit the same highlights that the trilogy went through, specifically because it uses footage directly from it; at the same time it gets a wild hair up its butt to introduce Wyald, the 8th and unexpected character within the roster that so far has not been used in any major Berserk media except this game to date. His inclusion is a no brainer because, it’s another Apostle and army to fight; however, for a fan of the franchise it’s a little weird to get most of the reason why he's in the story almost there, then drop the most important cause that his fight with the Band of the Hawk brings into effect (he knocks over Griffith, showing the state he's in to the rest of the mercs and that's why the Band of the Hawk is thinking about going their separate ways right before the Eclipse). This doesn't hinder the game for a player with no obsessive foreknowledge about minute details such as this, yet what is this game if not something for fans of Berserk?Outside of this, the story for the most parts follows the Golden Age, a condensed Black Swordsman with both Snake Baron and The Count, Conviction completely missing The Lost Children beginning, ending around the Falcon of the Millennium Empire right before that damned boat. Including a lot of content I honestly didn’t think they’d cover as succinctly as they did. And their overall attention to details, such as having different menus depending on where you were in the story progression, was genuinely impressive. What information they may not be able to convey in in-game blather, scenes or movie clips was for the most part allowed to be viewed in optional events. And even outside of Story Mode, in battles in Free or Endless Eclipse, there was genuine heart put into characters talking like they would talk even if they had been long since killed or going up against something they had no real chance to fight.But that in particular aspect of the game, seeing The Great Bazuso, thirty man slayer, mocking himself at every time I slaughtered a regular 1000 underlings, is where the short character selection comes back to bite the game in the♥♥♥♥♥ time and time again.  Because they have almost all the pieces that other Musos use, the reactions and interactions between every character in the game, the different types of fighting and strategies that each character brings with them. They are in the game. You can play against them in specific story parts. Yet, the player can’t play with all of the fully developed pieces in the game. It would be one thing if they just didn’t show up at all, like the mysterious disappearance of Azan. No, seriously KT, where is Azan? Get back to me on that, will ya?Where was I? Oh yeah, the pieces that are in the toy box, on full display, and arguably should be playable, LIKE FOR INSTANCE SAY A VERY PROMINENT AND AWSOME SKELETON KNIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE. Them being there, in game, taunting us with how close, yet so far we are from playing them, makes the short roster all the more painful. Especially if maybe they only come in the form of outrageously priced DLC or playable characters in an aforementioned potentially unlikely sequel.This is a niche within niche game. You don’t want to gimp any potential strength this game needs in order to build a fan base to generate further products! And I’m not even talking about the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that is later game Behelit goals, I’m talking basic things like music selection and increasing the odds of replayablity here! On that note, the soundtrack isn’t that bad, but with how much money this game costs as is, it’s very strange that there isn’t any movie, or more importantly, Susumu Hirasawa music. I’d even pay DLC money for it, but it’s all the stranger with its absolute absence in a Berserk game. The Dreamcast Sword of the Berserk: Gut’s Rage got Forces 2, Indra and an entire soundtrack. The unreleased outside of Japan PS2 game got Sign. Even the horrible 2016 anime got Oh Ashes. Yet this game gets no Hirasawa whatsoever? Are you even trying to get fans into this game or not?And then there’s the wonkiness of the PC port itself. I’m currently playing on a custom Intel i7 -6700K CPU with 4.00 Ghz with 32 GBs of RAM and I’ve crashed. Oh boy, have I crashed to desktop with this game so much. It’s controller only, to the point where it’s the only way to comfortably play the game at all. It can’t really run on Windows 10. It’s got problems. Hell, it might even be better to stay on a console, I’m not sure anyone has seriously done performance tests between both to really prove this one way or another, but I’m telling you, from my perspective, that this isn’t as good as it should be.But then we get to the real Blood and Guts -- and Guts and Blood, of this game: how it plays. And from every iteration of Guts to the self-aware every hungry brutality of Zodd, every character that you can access plays like you'd want them to. Every swing of Guts' giant slab of iron is heavy attacks, followed by even heavier attacks. With some rechargeable side actions like blowing a noticeably unimpressive cannon arm blast, to very useful concussive and damaging blasts from Miniature Bombs that prime enemies for some daze juggling, and completely useless arrows. Not every existing trick is worth it, but the real power comes from this game’s Frenzy Mode. With Frenzy comes Death Blows and Transformations, allowing you greater ways to decimate anything stupid enough to get into view.And yet, when it’s all said in done, I don’t hate this game. Hell, I wouldn’t be so negative about it if there wasn’t something I still like about the sum total of its parts! But because I actually care about it, I also know and will fully admit it can and should strive to do better than this!As it stands, I don’t really know if I could recommend its purchase to anyone. It’s not a bad game to try or play, however, I’m not sure it deserves a full $59.99. And knowing who owns this game, it will likely never will go lower than $29.99 in a sale, but even at that point, I’m not sure if I’d recommend a purchase of this version. But if you are still curious, and like me, are dumb enough to be a diehard in either Musou and Berserk, well, it’s your money."

The game plays very well and is everything you would expect from a Dynsasty Warriors style game with a Berserk skin. The story mode is really long. I'm about nine hours in and still haven't finished. There's also Endless Eclipse mode which is a pretty sweet gaunlet mode with some nice rewards.

If you have windows 10 it'll crash a lot infact the game will ask if you would like to switch to windows 7 or 8.1 just to avoid complications. It's nice to see that someone finally made another iteration of a really dark and gritty manga series as a video game.

It follows the story of Berserk as well as it can, taking small liberties here and there to help it fit the game as much as possible, as most anime sourced games tend to do. It covers all arcs fromThe Golden Age ArctoThe Hawk of the Millennium Arc. They even took the care to animate apparently over 2 hours of cutscenes. As you might expect, they look greatIt looks really good. It's rare to find anime-based games that look this good. And it sounds good too. The music isn't exactly what I'd call super memorable but that said it fits the game well enough. I do kinda wish that at least Guts' theme from the original adaption could have been used, as it's my favourite song from the series and the original music was just all around better. The voice acting is solid with many of them returning from both the movies and/or revived series.The gameplay is about what you'd expect fromDynastyat this point. Simple combo constuction, Tons of accessories and items to change your characters stats in a plethora of different ways and lots of enemies dying at the same time as you swing weapons like Guts' man-sized, sharpened slab of iron, Dragon Slayer. One addition I haven't seen before (mainly because I haven't bought any recentDynastygames) is the frenzy mode which turns you into an unstoppable killing machine that after you've hit enough enemies, allows you to pull off a special attack that simply annihilates everyone within the radius of the attack. It's fantastic as it turns everyone into a rain of blood and body parts at least in Guts' case, who so far is the only one I've played. Oh yeah, there are a fair few characters besides Guts to unlock, Zodd being my most anticipated one.I give the game 7.5/10. If you're a fan of Berserk, you'll love this game. I wouldn't have picked any other genre or series to build Berserk around. With this one, you can truly be the 100-Man Slayer."

With how well packed other Warriors games are  this is honestly a letdown.The big seller of this game is the story mode, which is very well handled here, you get about 90% of the manga covered in the game, and playing as different characters feels great since they each play slightly differently and have their own abilities.Overall it's good at a price drop for a fan of the manga who wants to experience the story in a more interactive way, don't expect any multiplayer or other modes."

,Recommended,502280,33466035,Posted: 11 July,all,Doctor Mosquito,"Covers every major plot point up to Fantasia, so if you're new to Berserk this is a good starting point, outside of watching the anime or reading the manga. The gameplay is standard Dynasty/Samurai Warriors fare, as per usual you're dropped into a battlefield with hundreds of grunts to slaughter. This is a bit different than previous games in the series though, as each character is unique and usually has unique specials and moves. Guts for example can get the Berserker Armor, whilst Griffith can become Femto, and Schierke can summon golems and such to fight. Some characters aren't up to snuff as these, like Casca and Judeau for example as they both feel like they were afterthoughts, and their gameplay isn't as exciting compared to the other characters. Speaking of which, the character list is a bit on the short side (no Skull Knight, really?) but all in all the roster is pretty decent.In conclusion, I do recommend this game but only if you're a fan of Dynasty Warriors, or if you're interested in Berserk."

The game itself is not so good.First - it is too easy, even in the hardest difficulty (Berserker mode), the game offers no challenge, just a bunch of paper enemies for you to mash buttons. The only nice battles are against the apostles.2nd - Too little strategy. Musou games should be about making smart choices in the battlefield, Berserk is just too simple (kill the general, help someone somewhere), and it is funny because it was the same studio that developed Dragon Quest Heroes, and DQH is sooooo much better musou game.3rd - Gameplay is fast, but too limited. You push X about five to six times, and its a combo, u push Y in the middle of the Xs spam, and gatts will do a variation, you can cancel attacks with dash, which is nice.To make it short, if you want to play a good musou game, go play something else.
