,Recommended,502370,29576683,Posted: 29 January,all,The Butcher's Nail,"I tried to get into tabletop WH40K. Good lord, did I try. But those buggers are expensive, they're time consuming, and it's almost impossible to find people to play with unless you're willing to crawl through the seedy underbelly of the comic-book-store-basement scene.So, instead, I consumed the novels, I bought every 40K game I could get, and I waited patiently for a virtual version of the tabletop game. I tasted hope back in the 90s with Chaos Gate, but it was a short lived pleasure. I felt bitter disappointment after disappointment with the bottom-tier offering from other publishers. I had, quite frankly, almost given up hope that I would ever find that perfect mix of strategy and lore that is WH40K - at least in game form.And then, out of the blue, without fanfare or spectacle, Sanctus Reach slipped onto the Steam New Release list.""Wait, what's this? A new 40K game? When did this happen?"" I wondered aloud.Then I saw the screenshots and the trailers, and I wasn't sure what to make of it. So I read the forum, and I started to smell something that seemed like hope. Hope that my old dream of a virtual WH40K tabletop would become a reality. So, purchase it, and install it I did.And, much to my most GLORIOUS pleasure, I found it. I finally found it! My white whale! That most elusive of dream became a reality, and it did so quitely - with dignity.Sactus Reach has done this thing, for us. For all of us lost souls, dreaming of a day when we could indulge our secret nerdy desire to pit superhuman space vikings against overgrown greenskin invaders in a TRUE tabletop representation.Buy this game. Support these developers. Keep this dream alive. Keep this ball rolling.Do it for the children of the future. They deserve this. And so do you."

The graphic style is clean and clear, though if it wasn't for the map I might sometimes miss gretchin hiding in the grass; the ability to highlight enemy units would be handy.The unit and firing animations are basic at best; the game weighs in at under 1GB so this is not surprising.  Still despite this I think the main focus of the game has gone into the gameplay and that's a far better place to spend your time!I'm only an hour in but just wanted to post positive feedback for those wanting to invest in a good 40k game but not be burnt...again."

If you are a veteran in PC gaming and Final Liberation and Chaos Gate were two of your favorite games, look no further!!! Your quest for finding a similar title has ended. Sanctus Reach is a squad/unit turn based strategy game, with basic objectives in every mission/map and with a linear campaign. But Sanctus Reach really shines in combat. Large variety of units for Space Wolves and Orks, cover tactics, fear/panic system when units suffer heavy damage and abilities that make units unique (terminators with stormshield/thunderhammer,teleport ability and iron mantle for extra toughness dominate the battlefield and can bring down ANY ork freak). Scout operations with landspeaders, wolfriders and other units, shock tactics with flamers and close combat specialists and many more strategies you can use in combat. The game can truly offer unique moments, like in mission 2 in first campaign where you have to transfer your units and some rhinos (space marines APC) on the other side of the cannyon through fire,rockets and endless ork reinforcements, i used a terminator unit as a rearguard inside a imperial structure carcass...in one turn they survived 10 attacks...they did buy enough time for the rest of the army, their sacrifice was not in vain. Although the campaigns ARE linear and the objectives are very, very simple/basic the combat system will reward you!!!As for the ""new"" gamers, you guys better try a demo before buying it. This game is a must buy for '80s and '90s gamers generations, but for the rest of the passionates, cannot recommend it...but better give it a try, you never know.Last notice, the game runs pretty smothly in low end laptops (i5, 2,5ghz, 8 GB ram and intelHD 4000) so have no worries."
,Recommended,502370,29393103,Posted: 21 January,all,thatguy17,"If you like turn based strategy games and WH40k, you will enjoy this game. It is a very good adaptation of the tabletop, and acts as a good substitute if you're like me and can't even dream of affording that stuff. They actually gave all the space wolves an accent, which was well done, and the campaign actually has a decent difficulty curve. Music is ok, albiet repetitive, and the sound effects are pretty good as well. Of note is the interesting mechanic, where if you are firing through other units from more than one tile away, you have a chance to hit the enemy/ally that is in the way. The other cool mechanic is the promotion system, where if your unit gets enough xp (earned by dealing the killing blow), they will receive a unique benefit in the form of a passive buff like special munitions/wolf amulets or an active ability, usually a grenade of sorts. This leads to some absurd combinations, like the thundernators that healed for 20hp every turn, had a wolf amulet forcefield, and a wolf charm(?) that gave them extra damage and hit chance, or the dreadnought that got a teleportation unit.The reason that this game is only pretty good and not amazing is the lack of polish. In my 28 hours(Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ TBF, I left the game running when I left for class.) I found at least 3-4 actual bugs, when a blood claw pack got the smoke grenade upgrade and used it, they got a mysterious 'bonus attack' complete with an unfinished texture. This attack could be repeated anywhere between 2-3 times, and when it stopped showing up, all you had to do was throw the now off cooldown smoke grenade. Other bugs include 100% to hit shots doing no damage,  and whirlwind missile impacts dealing no damage to hit units. Both of these last two are rather rare.To follow up with the bugs, the AI varies wildly to cunningly brutal, to brutally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. At some times orks will move up and swarm out of place marines, surround and cutoff transports, and properly use gretchin as proper tarpits. But in the next minute it has units of boyz disengaging from smashing a land speeder to run around in circles, or units of mega nobs doing laps around an exposed unit of blood claws. Of particular note, is the killa-kans relectance to fire their weapons or stab things with their claws in the majority of situations, the battlewagons forgetting that they have guns at all, and shooting attacks being directed through ranks upon ranks of their own men, doing more damage to themselves rather than me (although I think that one may be intended cause orkz).Despite all of this, it is still a very fun game. I hope that the bugs and AI deficiencies will be rounded out in the future, as they really hold the game back. Not a MUST GET AT ALL COSTS game, but if you like Turn based WH40K strategy games that handle the property right, and have the money, go for it.﻿Show less"
76561198154025830,Recommended,502370,32825260,Posted: 26 June,all,Mojo Amok,"I'm editing this review as I go along, but I've really enjoyed this so far. The mechanics are pretty simple, but you can have quite a lot of troops under your command, making it feel a nice balance with the amount of granularity.Positives- Very nice damage tracking with your fire teams; each individual model takes damage individually and the team's firepower degrades as they go down. Units are more vulnerable from the rear and there's even a physics system that tracks the shots and will hit intervening units (friend or foe).- Intuitive and elegant systems for morale and overwatch.- The capabilities of the unit's armor and weapons is well modeled with different weapons performing well or not depending on the appropriateness of the target that they're shooting at- Units level up as they gain kills and you then have a choice between two random abilities (often war gear). There seem to be quite al to of these.- Well crafted level design overall - There is also a random mission and map generator, which is fairly simplistic, but it does work and isn't buggy.- While it does rely on the random map generator for filler missions between the handcrafted ones, there's a pretty good bit of content here with the two campaigns. At 37 hours in, I finished the first campaign and am on the early stages of the second one (maybe that's longer than average and I'm a cautious player?).- The overall graphical fidelity isn't blow away, but the units themselves look pretty good and very much like miniatures on a table (some are actually identical to the current GW model - check the Painboy, for example). While a matter of opinion, the art direction overall is quite credible to my eyes.- Performance is exceptional, with my framerates far surpassing other turn based titles with what I would consider equivalent graphical fidelity.- Excellent support with ongoing patches and new content (we got a new Space Wolf hero for free as I'm writing this).Neutral-atives- Good replay value overall, but you might tire of the scenario objectives being driven by capturing control points each time (rectified in the Weirdly DLC for the Ork campaign to my understanding)- Lots and lots of missions with turn limits that mean you need to attack aggressively - this is probably a love or hate type proposition and I really like how they're done personally, but it's worth noting for people who hated that in XCOM 2. It's not like you're going to be permanently losing veteran units that don't make it to the extraction point or anything, but are often required to press the attack.- This is kinda a positive and a negative conjoined, but you've got a huge number of different unit types for both the Space Wolves and the Orgs, but with only those two factions. The unit variety and how they play is great with your tactical capabilities varying greatly based on what you decided to deploy. However, that's balanced against....only two factions.Negatives- Overall production values aren't great - this comes up with animations, sound effects and particle effects more than anything. All of those points are hit and miss.- The cover system is a bit counterintuitive with lots of LOS breaks cropping up when you aren't really expecting them.- Level design is good as noted, but not all of the missions are balanced as well as they should be. A few missions that I thought should have been highly climactic ended up being far too easy and I was thinking to myself hat I could have completed them with about half as many troops. There were a few where the inverse was true, but these were more related to the procedurally generated missions and outlier scenarios where assorted factors converged (ie. bad troop options and/or placement options for the terrain involved and so on).Overall I've had a lot of fun and its very similar to the now ancient 'Final Liberation: Warhammer Epic 40,000.' Not far off from moving miniatures around on the table either.I definitely see myself playing quite a lot of this one and it's easily worth the asking price for fans of this type gameplay. I really wish Total War: Warhammer had tactical battles that played like this."

76561198007157504,Recommended,502370,29777656,Posted: 8 February,all,Paladin,"I think I have enjoyed from Warhammer 40k since I was a child. Too bad that figures where so expensive that I had never a chance to buy those. When I grew up I had money, but then there weren't any one to play with. So figures were left in the store. Still I wished to play WH40K. I think it was a late 90 th. I found  a game called Final Liberation, a massive battle against green tides of orcs. It was a blast! Then came the Chaos Gate, Ultramarines chapter struggle against chaos forces. Those were epic experiences what I have been wanting to experience again. After that I have played probably all WH40K games found out at the pc. Most of them were major disappointments, so I wasn't expecting too much from Sanctus Reach either, but I gave it a try. Sanctus Reach was a blast! I think this is the best turn based WH40K game. This is the game I have been missing ever since Chaos Gate ended.Sanctus Reach captures tt. experience well. It feel that you actually have those tiny figures who are fighting against orcs. Rules are simple but still good. Hitting the opponent feels like one would be rolling dices. Learning curve is well done. It isn't too simple but not too hard. Units have have strengths and weaknesses, which adds more strategy to the game. In some games you can't have all the units you want, which means that one can't have the perfect army. It gives more variety to missions.Random map generation in a skirmish battles is nice, since you can't expect what happens in the battle. Skirmish battles are defensive, offensive or clash at the middle. Map chances give variation to that, but over all skirmish battles feel the same. I hope that in a future patches skirmish battles would feel more different. Maybe that defensive side would have less units and one would have to defend winning points. Or maybe even hold few points x many turns or escort unit to point x.Over all unit balance is well done. Units are interesting and every patch balances unit more. There are enough diversity in units and many of iconic units are included in both armies. Only real balance issue at current version is the (op) Battlewagon. But in future patches that will be fixed. Also in the first space marine campaign there could be more space marines with anti tank weapons. Game isn't really too hard, but in many missions it felt that I had too little ways to deal with armored units. Unit promotion is something player can't affect. I think it is a bad thing. Some times promotion is disadvantage, which isn't fun. But that happens rarely and usually promotion is a good one. I hope in a future player could choose upgrades.Graphics aren't perfect but not a bad either. While writing this I haven't tried to latest version, but according the patch notes animations should be smoother. I think it makes the game play better experience. I hope that in future there will be more landscapes and more armies.Even with the flaws this is a great game! Like I wrote earlier the best tt. based WH40K game. I hope all those who enjoy from turn-based WH40K games try this game. I hope that we get more games like this in future!"

76561198004686603,Recommended,502370,29461167,Posted: 24 January,all,Naaxelder Vane Senoj,"SR is a turn based wargame based on the Warhammer 40k Universe.  You take control of an army of either Orks or Space Wolf Space Marines and engage in turn based combat.The game comes with two campaigns which consist of a few story missions interspaced with random skirmish missions.  Other game modes include skirmish as well as a mission and campaign editor.Typically before a fight you will be able to choose your starting force.  You have force points and you pick your army, each unit costs X amount of points.  You can build you force until you have no more points to spend.  Your opponent does the same (Campaign missions are a bit different ).Missions typically involved battling over strategic points on the map and whoever controls the most by the end of the turn timer wins, although you can also win by wiping the opponent off the map.Gameplay wise units can move, shoot and perform special moves.  Each unit has separate move points, action points and special abilities (if unlocked).  So a unit can move and shoot and use a special action (like throw a grenade) in the same turn.  No action point counting.  This leads to nice fluid gameplay which is important considering the vast amount of units that can be in play.For Campaigns, units gain XP for kills and level up gaining new abilities, both passive and active which makes keeping these units around interesting.Graphically I like it, bit of a cartoony / modely feel but it works very well and it is very satisfying to see your bolters let loose and units explode into gore!  This looks closer to what the table top would than “realism” and works well.All units are also to scale and when you have loads of units from Bolter wielding space marines to hulking Imperial Knights you get a great sense of scale.Main disappointments is there is a lack of fluff for the campaigns, no real story per se, just a bit of text on the campaign missions (right now it is 1 campaign mission, 3 – 4 skirmishes, 1 campaign mission etc) so feels a bit disconnected (imo) and the maps can feel a bit bland at time (especially the random generated ones).  The fun gameplay makes up for these shortcomings however and I really feel this game can grow even better with the proper support!"

Aesthetically it is 100% tabletop - the units and terrain are faithful reproductions of the model kits.   Gameplay is very close to the tabletop experience but simplified in a way that suits solo PC play, and I can say from the first couple of scenarios I've played so far, it's quite simple to learn but actually has a reasonable level of difficulty.This is certainly worth the price, especially for tabletop players and people who have been waiting for years for something comparable to Chaos Gate or Final Liberation.  I have no complaints about this product, but do hope that future updates introduce further factions."

I have tabletop armies too (that I never have/will use) but love painting them and that seemed to draw me into just about everything WH40K. Sanctus Reach is clearly just the 1st installment of a much larger game. Its fun and has plenty of strategy. Well worth the money.
76561197989521605,Recommended,502370,29617562,Posted: 31 January,all,Hellkyte,"Bought this game last week and spent a good 20 hours or so on it this weekend, which is a good sign as is, but lets be fair any decent strat game can pull that out of me.  So, here's what I can say about it.I have spent the last decade or so pulling my hair out wondering why people don't just make the simple and almost always succesful tactical strategy games I remember from when I was younger.    Nothing too complex, just cover mechanics, AP, decent balance, etc.   So when one comes along I usually get pretty into it.Sanctus Reach IS a solid tactical strategy game in this sense.   Cover mechanics work well, units are well balanced and have a distinct feel and purpose.  The AP system is well implemented and enjoyable.  There are lots of choices to be made in terms of optimizing your loadout, rarely is one unit universally good.   For that reason I consider this game worth the purchase and I would recommend it.That said, Sanctus Reach is mostly a very good framework for a great game, as opposed to being a great game itself.  There is no overarching grand strategy of any importance.  Sure your guys level up as you go on, but unit death has limited effects and map progression is highly linear.   Further, while units are well balanced and logical, there really aren't a lot of them at the moment.  There are currently only 2 army types.Also, the missions are almost all the same.   But I need to emphasize that isn't as bad as it sounds.  While most missions are ""Capture the most victory points"" it's worth recognizing that you can still get a TON of variety in gameplay from that based on the map layout and your troop loadout.   This is why VP games are still the mainstay of 40k games after so many years.  There are a few more varied missions scattered about, but not that many.My hope is that DLC will be the thing that takes this from the Good category to the truly Great category.    Time will tell."
76561198013789779,Recommended,502370,29480308,Posted: 25 January,all,Level 1 Commoner,"Buying Warhammer games is like playing roulette due to GW's absolute lack of common sense (or their absolute lack of care as long as they get paid)  when selling video game licenses for their tabletop universes. Most of them are garbage, but some are awesome.Sanctus Reach is rock solid now and has the potential to be awesome with some patching and dlc content. It's a tactical turn-based wargame that succesfully transfers the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game to the pc. The rules are streamlined and a little less ""dicey"" than the boardgames rule set. But in my opinion it is still a very faithful adaptation of 40k and its lore that avoids the mistake of the 2013 Space Hulk game, that tried to be a literal board game to pc conversion and failed.The campaign missions themselves are divided into rather basic skirmish missions (which can mostly be solved by doing the lame XCOM:EW overwatch turtle tactic) with almost even odds and story missions where you have to fight giant orc hordes and achieve specific objectives that are much more challenging. The enemy AI is solid and relentlessly focusses your weakest units or high priority targets like artillery (although that can be used to lure them into traps ).The visuals are very nice and the unit models look great. The animations are good as well and especially the heavy weapons fire ""feels"" powerful. The voice acting is at least tolerable. I ran into no technical issues myself but others did.I really hope the devs implement some of the following propositions, which would elevate the game to XCOM or Silent Storm levels in my eyes:- immersive and flavorful combat briefings and debriefings- the ability to speed up movement and combat animations- faster AI turn calculation- warcrys are played while moving or shooting and not consecutively- more indepth levelup system (choosing the new abilities and traits and getting stat boosts for the units combat stats instead of only getting a random trait or ability for each level up)- full army builder- more factions and difficulty settings in coming DLC"

I was surprised completely regarding how addictive the gameplay was. Even though its turn based, it created more tension then any other RTS game I've played. The graphics are awesome especially in 4K. There's  a huge amount of strategic depth that permeates this title. You can become easily attached to certain units in your roster, especially since they earn experience after each successful engagement with the enemy.

There's a good variety of units to choose from, but no customization.

You have to use the terrain, both for cover as well as considering the different effects on your movement rate, use the different units in their specific roles, position yourself for reaction fire, scout and keep an eye on reinforcements.The missions require you to manouvre and constantly adapt and change where to concentrate your forces.Sure, it´s not perfect. In my laptop, it runs very slowly. Skirmishes become quite grindy and there are too few different types of skirmish missions. And in many missions you can´t choose your own initial deployment, which is perhaps my major complaint.Still, well worth it as a strategy game and a 40k game.

As should be obvious, I really like this game. Or did anyway. The first iteration of the game was amazing, and the update after that fixed a few problems and didn’t cause any. However, the latest update is horrible. The game now freezes my custom-built gaming computer when I try to exit, and continues to run in the background to the point that I have to cold boot to get the PC going again. Along with that, the new update seriously conflicts with some of the better virus security programs in use, such as Webroot Secure causing some really weird problems like deleting all the sound drivers. How about putting a little more effort into making sure the code doesn’t conflict? As for the actual updates to the game play, most are fine except for the ork reinforcements magically appearing at random points around the battlefield. They have created the same unplayability that has plagued Space Wolf; that is, you can’t take territory and move on to the next objective because the orks could appear anywhere on the board. The game was intended to be as much like the wonderful 40K tabletop game as possible, but the random of teleportations of large numbers of orks behind and around your lines is a real game killer. I hardly play anymore and won’t until they get their act together and fix things."

The developers managed to grasp this specific warhammer feel. If you ever played table top, this is the closest to it one can get in the market now.Campaigns are well thought out and very entertaining however if you are a seasoned strategy gamer and know a bit about Wh40k universe they may be a bit easy, the devs announced introducing difficulty levels soon tho.Multiplayer is also fun as hell, it's tougher to play as orks as they generally have weaker armour, less long ranged units and they are not the best snipers in the world but their heroes have many cool abilities that make up for it if you know how to use them smartly. Ork units are a bit too pricey for what they're worth but the nearest patch is said to fix it.Sanctus Reach has also skirmish editor which allows you practice playing against the computer AI as Space Marines or Orks + a full fledged map\mission editor allowing to create your own missions.The devs are very responsive, they pay close attention to what player base is saying and improve the game systematically, it has already been announced that Chaos daemons and Imperial Guard will be the next factions to follow.I have been waiting for a game like this since the legendary Chaos Gate, I am fully satisfied and want more. If you like Wh40k and strategy games Sanctus reach is definitely for you."

Well done!The game runs fine on my old laptop and comes as a quite small download.Yes, it does NOT look AAA, but it is very serviceable and the units are designed to look like the actual miniatures.Even more tabletop feel!So far, only the Space Wolves are playable, but the developers are already thinking about more different factions for the future. There is also already a mod/ option available and instructions in the forum on how you can ""repaint"" the units to fit your own Space Marine Chapter, someone has already converted the Wolves into Dark Angels.Since I was toying with the idea of starting a actual tabletop army of Space Puppies myself, I am actually quite happy to try them out in this game beforehand.All in all a great game for fans of the actual tabletop.This might NOT be for you if you do not like turn-based games, expect AAA graphics or are a little impatient- turns can take some time. This is NOT a fast game.There are a few hickups and minor bugs in the game (for me, from time to time enemy units were not displayed and just disappeared) but the developers seem to be very active and react very quickly. They are already working on some of the issues. So far great feedback from the developers.I also had no problems with crashes and also do not mind the UI which some people have complained about. Works fine for me.To the developers- thank you for the great game, good job! Keep it up!"
76561198032627477,Recommended,502370,29446984,Posted: 23 January,all,Epicrealm,"This is the best squad level turn-based grid game that I have played in the past few years. It really shines in the skirmish mode with a great amount of replayability.  I love the fact that you get quite a bit of options when setting up your skirmish battle.  To top that off you get to place your units in chosen tactical locations prior to the battle while in the deployment phase.  Random skirmish maps are really random.  I can use the exact same setting when setting up my skirmish, and the maps are still quite diverse.The terrain is destructible and many of the units have enough move points to move near the front lines and then back away again, to see enemy units that were covered by fog of war or terrain cover. This allows for numerous tactical and strategic plans.At first I thought this game was pretty hard, I was not used to the different aproach in how to control the units compared to other games of the same type.  After a few hours into the game I started to like it more and more.I highly recommend this game even for the full price, It's worth it!  I will be buying any DLC's that come out for this game. I like it that much! So have fun playing, I know you will!"
76561198019023654,Recommended,502370,32483165,Posted: 16 June,all,CavityCommunion,"Worth the full price.Pros:Very close to the table top, original, version of Epic 40k.Each model in a unit has its own hitpoints. When it dies it can't take an action, but your other models in the unit can. Action are things like shooting or throwing a grenade; movement is separate.Space Marines(Wolf faction) and Orks are well balanced.Many small details such as Infantry able to hide behind cover, but the hulking mech like units can't.Units gain experience and abilities. Though keep in mind this is not an RPG.Units look like their real world counterparts. Same for the terrain. Well if they were all painted by someone with high skill and talent. Have you ever tried to paint the original tiny models? Not easy.The maps for the two campaigns are well done.(Except Back From the Brink.)The devs really do listen to their players. Make changes accordingly. So rad.Cons:The units start on either side as in the table top original, but you either get to change them from the original set up or you get to go first depending on the map. It would be much better if players were allowed to choose for each map and another way to decided which side goes first. Having terminators(heavy, slow infantry) on one end of the starting position and your rhino/land raider(tranports) on the other side is irritating.If your units all start on the same side of the map I'm finding it doesn't matter if they're split to hint/encourage fighting on two fronts. It seems its always best to keep them all together.The animations for opposing units can not be sped up so a battle can take a long time while waiting for each animation to resolve. I end up playing in full windowed mode and doing something else while the AI takes its turn. I posted about this and a dev responded and said they're working on something for that issue. So yes, they listen.Again definitely worth full price. Easy to understand. The same depth as the table top. If not familiar with the table top original you'll be able to understand the game quite easily and enjoy it."

It has it's limitations, you can only choose from space wolves and orks and the campaign is only space wolves but I feel the price properly reflects that limitation. I do hope however that in the future they can expand on both the amount of factions and the amount of different units per faction you can choose from but as it stands this game gets my recomendation especially if your into 40k, X:com, or simply see it on sale and like turn based strategy games."

I have never played the tabletop game (sadly) but as a minor follower of Warhammer lore and an addict to watching battle reports online, I love this game. The first few hours are a bit rough, but once you do a few missions and start getting into the better units from the campaign the game is solid. I suppose one could argue that only having 2 factions is heresy and the price point might be a $5-$10 dollars too much, but I just spent 90 minutes on 1 campaign level moving support tanks, watching my terminators decimate a battalion of grimlins, and sending 2 units of space marines to their death just to buy time for my other units to escape. The poor souls went down bravely taking an Ork battle buggy with them. The Emperor would be proud.It doesn't have great polish, but what is present is enough for you to RP into the scenarios presented. I believe it is completely worthwhile to buy now knowing more patches are on the way. If more factions come in as DLC, I would be extremely happy (Astra Militarum please). Now I must go back to killing greenskins since i still haven't unlocked predator tanks or land raiders. THE EMPEROR PROTECTS!"

It has a lot of TT feels to it yet maintains a unique game play.  It isnt a move shoot assault by turn but more fluid and less cumbersome that the TT.Overall awesome game and really enjoy it. Recommended!Some likes:- Great graphics. Just like having a well painted army on the table- Great mechanics and animations for movement and weapons- Great balance so far, hope to see lots of new races.- Campaign is fun and challenging at times.- Experience system is fun and adds depth to what your units do.Some cons at this time:- No difficulty level in Campaign?- Cant enter buildings- Cant shoot or move through Ruins- No multi level Ruined buildings that you can move up to gain the advantage- You can shoot into melee without big penalties- You can shoot out of melee for some reason- Reaction shots seem to be at a very good accuracy- You cant start a game with units embarked on transports- You can assault with troops after dissembarking from a non-assault vehicle.- Currently lots of vehicles and upgrades not available, hoping for free DLC in time.- Is there Multiplayer for 3+ players?

76561198012346744,Recommended,502370,32599616,Posted: 20 June,all,Kazmund,"This game has really grown on me - there are two primary reasons.First, the sheer variety of units available.  It's been fun finding out the capabilities of each and how they best work together.  And once you're bored with the Wolves, you can always start fiddling with the Orks on random maps.Second, it's very well balanced.  I suppose they're capitlaizing on the experience of the table top games there.  Most scenarios are short, bloody affairs where you're trying to take control of a few victory points in a set number of turns (often less than 10 turns).  Early going, you'll probably roll the Ork forces, but later on in some of the better crafted missions, you'll have a few white-knuckle moments.  This also happens with random games, since the initial force composition may favor the enemy.At any rate, good game.  I recommend to anyone interested in TBS."

I'm not referring to translating the rules to PC but the look. The models are exquisitely detailed and the terrain map is like what you would find at a game at your local Games Workshop.I am not looking for a line by line translation of the tabletop game to PC, and this isn't it. What it is is a fun and engaging game that faithfully channels the feel of the 40K universe. It's like having my own professionally painted armies at the fraction of the time and cost!As for the game itself, I like it. It works. It's fun. Yes it's a bit sparse given the vastness of the 40K Universe.

It has awesome audio and voice work with inspiring epic war cries and agony filled death filled moans.Music is top notch excellence alive with ground thumping troop stomping tribalism encased in the armor of classical music as if coming from the very earth with eerie whispers and chant like rhythms.Graphics are euphoric to experience with incredible detail to units as if playing with tabletop minitures and blissful levels of visual carnage including bodily dismemberment capturing the extreme gore in all its grim ghastly heroic godliness like no other Warhammer game has since Chaos Gate. The user interfaces and different menu screens are all professionally done with stunning art work giving off the perfect mood of the game world's reality.Optimisation is on the money with everything working flawlessly. The stats and modifiers richness making for game balance which feels miraculous in its execution as i command huge numbers of troops who use morale, cover and terrain with different height levels keeping me smiling and wide eyed like the happiest kid in the world as i have a unit of Space Wolves take a flamethrower to green orky flesh.When am setting up a attack its very easy to see what the possible outcomes are with all the on screen information giving a very natural elegance and sense of what is going on. Game mechanics are in the style of BATTLE ACADEMY with plenty of morale checks reminding me of STEEL PANTHERS with all the mayhem and chaos going on in the battlefield. Using squares instead of hexes for movement does not feel odd actually feeling quite natural with a game mechanic where you can turn your units facing to focus its attention in a certain direction.When all my movement and action points are used the game lets me know with a bullet icon above the unit which is great for avoiding second guessing. There is also a button on the ui which takes you to the next available unit awaiting orders. For an ocean's worth of information there is a tactical mode which will reveal all sorts of info about what is going on in the field. Scale feels more personable so am assuming its squad based or in the same style of BATTLE ACADEMY.Gameplay is more tactical with morale, type of weapons and their range, different terrain types with many variables for cover all effecting situational awareness and combat outcomes. Terrain and certain types of cover can also be destroyed by weapons fire.Troops gain experience and eventually level up where they become more efficient and deadlier combatants. Between battles such as during deployment you can see how much more experience is needed to level up and if one is acquired the game will let you know so there is no searching huge numbers of your men to see who has leveled up. All armies including the enemy can suffer from friendly fire which can lead to some funny moments when a sure kill ends up taking out one of your own units as well.Unit characteristics are on the mark with everything feeling as powerfully epic as it should with Terminators kicking humongous tail and Gretchins getting some love being a threat and sinister distraction as cannonfodder.Sanctus Reach also reminds me alot of Final Liberation from the 1990s with its variety of troops and how many are on the battlefield at the same time including the massive ground cracking monolithic Dreadnoughts.Another cool thing about SANCTUS REACH is seeing individual men and orks die as the unit is worn down by long range and melee fire giving a sense of accomplishment with each shot or melee attack that hits.WARHAMMER 40,000 SANCTUS REACH feels like the spiritual successor to the 1990s classic FINAL LIBERATION while still being its own complete different animal a proud wolf bringing home the joy of tabletop gaming nirvana like no other Warhammer game before. I cant believe something this perfect is selling for such a low price.WARHAMMER 40,000 SANCTUS REACH, BUY IT! PLAY IT!

The rules have been condensed somewhat however, but it plays a bit like a slower X Com Enemy Unknown turn based gig. At present Sanctus reach offers Space Wolves V Orks, but in time i should imagine more factions will follow. A no-brainer for 40k enthusiasts and/ or turn based strategy guys."

Currently with 10 hours played i am only about to finish the first of the two campaigns.The unit veterancy mechanic works well, with units gaining abilities and or equipment such as krak grenades or inferno ammunition etc. which not only makes veterans something you treasure in your army roster but also something that adds quantifiable value to a veteran squad. A veteran dreadnought with void shields and extra armour held a choke point for the best part of 20+ turns against what must have been a solid 20-30 units of Orks with everything from Gretchint to Nobz and Killa Kanz etc.It has its weak points namely in presentation with a decent but not overly pretty graphical quality, and the voice work can be a bit hit or miss.

Terminator armour does not restrict you boarding a rhino2. Vehicles and walkers cannot fire all their weapons but have action pts just like all units3. Vehicles can move full distance and fire normally.4. Variances in units and weapons to the table top version all seem to make it a well rounded computer version of the neckbeard-loving game.Overall the feel of all the units and the tabletopiness(not a word) of it is perfect for me. I do worry I'll complete it before any update or DLC appear. There has been an update to fix some bugs which is great to see them improving it so swiftly.

The engine and interface seem to be based on Battle Academy 2 which I didn't particularly like but the 40k array of monsters, robots and vehicles help to bring this game alive and make it enjoyable to play. There are not many really good turn-based tabletop wargames on the PC (XCom 2 for me has too many layers and is overblown) and so this is a welcome addition to the genre. The essence of the game is moving your units around on the map and taking advantage of strategic points, cover and weaknesses of the enemy. The actual unit depiction is quite nice with huge robots striding across the map but the interface and game overlay is clunky although you do get used to it. The camera also has a habit of choppily zooming around from unit to unit and it isn't smooth - there are still a lot of rough edges to this game especially in terms of its representation.What is great fun is using your giant robots to blast the enemy to pieces and there is a large selection of units even though there are only two playable races at the moment. Unlike Battle Academy, there seems to be a far larger choice of units and this makes for exciting battles. There are also little added touches like being able to fire at an enemy unit with a friendly unit in your line of sight. The friendly unit will take a random amount of damage. Helicopters and bikes also cover a large amount of ground which can lead to good opportunities to snipe at the enemy and to successful flank attacks and surprise assaults.The multiplayer system is basically based on async play. You have to log in and set up games, move your pieces, and then wait for the opponent to take his turn which is usually the next day. I am actually enjoying my multiplayer matches and the game works well in this format although it does seem to harken back to PBEM systems of long ago. Slitherine could do with updating their multiplayer modes. Perhaps a proper, live skirmish mode with a small number of units would work akin to a game like Chaos Reborn.If the developers create new races, design more diverse maps, have a proper live skirmish mode, and smooth out the graphics I think this could be a huge game in the future. There just isn't much to match it on the PC right now. 8.5/10"

I personally think that, if they choose to release a sequel to this game, they should include:more races of characters,more units for each race,a longer campaign encompassing the new units,more of a connection to units (in the form of maybe a permanent death system where your leveled up units can die and then not be used again in future missions, furthering your connection to each individual unit),unit and hero customization (units gain abilities, traits, weapons, and items),different chapters of each race,"

Graphics are above average, but nothing special. I'd say sound effects are immersive. The UI choices are a bit of a turn off, completely functional, but they have this unfinished look to them that clashes with the rest of the game. My first two games seemed overwhelming at first in that the orcs seemed to keep coming, but hey that's what the horde does....  we were able to prevail by the skin of our teeth so it's all good right? For some of the missions the campaign game appears to be using procedural generated maps, so there  appears there would be some replay value. It also offers multiplayer and skirmishes in addition to the campaign missions,Edit 2017-01-23: Multiplayer is more of a play by email or play and wait style then your more modern live style. Basically you register and login to a server setup your turn and send it to your opponent. There is a dialogue system that accompanies the turn file, so you can still have a conversation but it's more play and wait. I was actually able to setup a hotseat game with myself so you are able to do that too. It's probably going to be more common to play the matches over a couple of days or week using a turn or two a day then it will be to do an entire match over an entire sitting. While there is a comment section (and mentioned dialogue), using this format it probably should have been better to have a section that has turn expectaions/time limits displayed more easily for users.Was able to confirm via manual that the campaign is setup in a way where you're playing a standard mission followed by some random generated missions, standard mission hen some random misisons followed by, standard mission etc etc."

Shut up and take my money!Long Version: It's a turn-based strategy game played on a grid, reminiscent of FFT and Disgea. The look and feel of the game is amazing at first, but after playing a few skirmishes, I quickly noticed the game has little depth. Units can level up, but you have no say in what bonuses they get for doing so, and there are no wargear options. It's easy to pick up and play, the mechanics are simple, and it's fairly entertaining. However, there are no RPG elements to this game. It plays more like a board game than anything resembling the tabletop game or a turn-based RPG like those previously mentioned. All that said, it's a good time, but wait for it to go on sale. It is not worth $30. Not by a long shot."

This is (likely) as close to the table-top on your computer as you'll ever get.  So I hope this is just the beginning, just a framework, for more DLC to come.  The 40k universe is rich with characters, alien races and units that could fit right in to this game.  Here's hoping.It's just after launch as I write this but it's surprisingly compete for a game these days.  The negatives I have are merely nitpicks about the learning curve for the interface and a few minor bugs.  (Such as my Whirlwind's hilarious -465% chance to hit a target and still manages to blast it to green confetti anyway.)I guess the biggest complaint is that the alien AI could use some work.  I've noticed that Killer Kans especially often wander around aimlessly like old folks lost at the shopping mall.  And Orkz only capture objectives if they happen to walk over it.  I know these are Orkz but they should at least put a little effort into winning.Finally, Orkz are more than happy to blow other Orkz to smithereens in order to shoot you.

This is one of the better Warhammer 40k games to come out in a while. As someone who has played the tabletop game this hits a good balance of complexity. The current AI is not a genius, but it is the orks. At least so far the devs seem to be commited to ongoing work on the game.  Sanctus Reach invites modding so I think that there will be plenty of good content going forward.

A few questions I would ask the developers is does the map take into account elevation? As having the high ground would place for more accurate shot,(by the way I do love the way bolter shots scatter the further you are away you are) It plays well with the short range of a bolter, Why dont the flamer units have reaction zone the Space marine flamers seem to do less damage than Orks and having a reaction zone at the cost of action point would balance it? and finaly is there any planned additional content? It would be quite fun to vary the tactic say between the swift stealthy but fragile tactics of the Eldar and the Brutal blitz of Chaos Undivided, Just but otherwise its perfect but it would be quite good to mix it up.

I had to lose hundreds of units until I really figured out how to best use each one.The only downside (hopefully, only for the moment) is that there is a lack of variation. I think they could easily write more 1 player campaignes (maybe some famous ones) and add more races. Also, the upgrades are great - but agian it would be good to be able to select particular abilities for each unit - some would cost more xp then others since some abilities suck and others are all-powerful.... at the moment its random, so a tough cookie like a terminator might get a girly auspex, and a weakling flamer unit might get genetic mutation or blood rage.... which is a bit useless for them.But hey, I am nit-picking becuase I think this could be so much better.... but its already v.v.good!"

You may hold hope that your machine of war might respond to the enemy harassment with mechanical fury, though your prayers would be in vain.  Your landspeeder could surely free your dreadnought from such a pit of tar, should he not be, himself, adjacent to an enemy.  Rejoice, however, for the same aspects that drive you to doubt the emperor are blessings of their own.  Not a single Kan of Killing shall harm you, so long as you place a Blood Claw adjacent.

(update - overwatch seems to be effective now, quite pleased in this)Seriously, fix this game so it can be the best WH40k simulator out there.  Personally, I recommend ICs and Walkers to ALWAYS return fire/melee.  The fact that models only attack back if they don't receive damage is cool and all for 4v4 melee, but with 4v1, that 1 is going to take damage, if even 1 point, to prevent him from striking back (glaring at you, Imperial Knight).  IC are junk, and walkers are crap in melee.

Randomly generated maps are good quality with decent tileset variety.Graphics look nice and performance is generally good.  Animations and sound effects are pretty poor.  Sometimes a voice line is triggered when attacking.  You are forced to wait for it to play in its entirety before the attack animation commences, unnecessarily lengthening the amount of time enemy turns (or your own) can take.  This is only an issue in large battles and the voice lines are random (thankfully).  It doesn't even seem to correspond to critical hits or high damage attacks.  I had a voice line triggered and thought, ""Oh, wow this will be good.""  Only hit for 20HP.Campaign is Space Wolves only, but there are two 20+ mission campaigns.  Unit progression through the campaign is nice and ranked up units receive additional abilities that make them more desirable and effective.  At the start of the next mission, however, it is not easy to see which units are the veterans.  The UI won't filter them from what I can tell, so you have to hunt for them.Gameplay is incredibly basic.  Cover is either light or heavy and depending on the tileset it is not easy to distinguish between the two unless a view mode is toggled.  Terrain that obstructs line of sight is also hard to distinguish depending on the tile set.  Enemy units will sometimes move through terrain that you don't initially think they should be able to move through.  Units can only move and shoot or enter melee.  Once in melee, units cannot disengage.  You cannot set units to overwatch or any defensive mode (that I could tell).  Units receive one free reaction shot per turn if an emey gets too close in the direction that unit is facing.EDIT:  Developers patched a lot of the issues I griped about.  Totally worth it now."

The shortest way to Victory isn't always going to end up the way you planned. Sacrifice some of your hard working soldiers to let another one win. Will often end out to your favor. This game can vary from great tactial manuvers instead of disasters where all of your troops gets massacred. Think what else you can do ways to complete the campaign. Falling the enemies in their bags will sometimes come a a total suprice to them. The shortest route isn't alwways the best. And don't just go to the closest battle. This field has many pieces.

On the other hand, I will write why I hesitate, since it shocked me:1 This game has most sloppy and boring campaign in all campaigns I played for very long time. One of the reasons is it's briefing before the battle is so poorly and carelessly presented that I couldn't think of anything worse than that. I can understand not all the projects have so many resources that people can make high quality cinametic in campaign to make the story so alive (such as Starcraft 2), but seriously guys? Two sentences telling me where my troops are and where orcs troops are are what we can call briefing in a campaign? I see only slopiness.2 Very boring victory condition in the campaign. I've only played 4 battles until now. All the goals are seeing who have most victory points. I did check on youtube of more battles and what I saw was it seems the only goal in the game. I could be wrong, since I haven't check each of every battle or stage. Campaign is nothing in this game. It's just a serie of random maps combining together for whatever reason and pretend it will work like a campaign and deliver the experience.Edit: I'm wrong, see one stage that needs to protect a unit. OK, it feels better now.3 I don't feel the difference between Space Marine and Orc. I jumped to this game after Armargeddon, so it may affect my judgement. However, what I feel in the game is I'm fighing against a Space Marine army who for whatever reason has orc skin. Enemies look like orc, but each individual squad is equally strong as Space Marine counterpart. Is it my impression of orc is wrong, or game desginers don't care of creating any difference? I don't know.Well, those are what shocked me when I started to play. Those shocked me to the point that I asked for refund, but too bad, I played for too long at the point already. Then, I guess I will keep playing it just as a casual whatsoever game, since at least the turn-based mechanism is enjoyable to me and no buggs is seen yet, both of which are values quite hard to find nowadays and the reason at end of the day I choose to recommend it."

This feels like a upgraded version of Armaggeddon which i have played through and all the DLC.  Dont buy into this thinking its a AAA game, presentation is lacking in some areas for example mission briefings.  Could do with a bit of gravitas, this is a galaxy at war after all.However despite the criticisims i would reccomend this.  Its a solid turn based stratergy game with plenty to keep a 40k fan happy.

If you go for fancy graphics or similar you're in the wrong place, though. This doesn't mean the graphics are bad, they are ok-ish but nothing top notch.However, Sanctus Reach in my opinion more or less IS the original tabletop: Pick your troops based on point limit, deploy as you wish and then charge to your objective more or less subtle. Unlike some other round-based games this won't go on forever since you only have a certain amount of rounds to play before you either win or lose. Did I mention this is very much the tabletop come to life?As of now you only have the Wolves of Fenris (in the campaign) and the orks (in multi-player) available as faction but I certainly hope they will continue this and add more factions, maybe even campaigns.10/10 would purge the Xenos again."

When I played, the orks had no idea what to do when armor was near them.  It seemed like they were trying to find a path into your rhino to get at your troops.The subsequent campaigns seem to be what big companies would sell as expansion packs - almost totally different.  I guess that's a positive, though I'd prefer the first campaign to be the same.  The difficulty was pretty right-on.  Though, having an overpowered dreadnought autocannon as your only anti-armor for the entire first campaign was lame.  The Predator was lame, a destructor that can't fire its sponson (heavy bolters) with its vastly inferior autocannon.I give it waste of time/10.

However, do not think that it is 40k in any terms of functionality. It looks 40k but that is about where it stops. I say that being a 30 yr vet of the table top.I also know that GW wouldn't let them mirror table top play exactly, that would detract from that cash cow of theirs right? But still, you would expect to atleast have some functions that mirror the core game it is based off. And they throw in some terms that are copied so it seems like they are going in the right flow, but the functionality is way off in the other direction and does not apply fairly to both sides.So I don't play MP - this is strictly based off my single player campaign experience.  Also my #'s are averages based on my 2nd camp play throu. I didn't track the Orcs.MoraleIt says once units enter negitive morale, they have restrictions - that applies to the Wolves, but does not apply to the Orc. They WILL advance towards you even thou broken or panic'd - the only thing I can see that morale does is allow you freedom of movement around them as their zone of control is broken.Also they do  not react ( fall back ) in your turn, but their turn, so naturally they gain a bit of morale back and rarely do they ever stay ""Broken"" because of this. I have even seen Nobs go from broken ""0 morale"" to ""51 morale"" on the flip of the turn. Yep that is some pretty amazing rally abilities - and no a leader wasn't anywhere near the unit.Weapon damage ranges -Wolves Flamers suck damage wise, only good for lowering morale, and vs Orc's that are traditionaly lightly armored. Wolf flamers or Hvy Flamers do 50pts of damage on average. Orc flamers are amazing and I have seen 90pt to 140pts to total kill - Combi/schorcha's are even  more so.Melta guns are good, but you always shoot 1 target and despite having 2 shots. This applies to most weapons that shoot twice - like the dreadnaughts - twin linked auto cannons =4 shots all at 1 target in the group - so it doesn't spread the damage out let alone spread out 2 cannon shots to the groups. Las Cannon infantry also has the same problem.The only weapon that doesn't apply for is the hvy bolter - which you would expect. And yes, that doesn't apply to the Orcs, they will mow down ever target in a group with any weapon.Bolters are of course under powered vs anything but grots - despite the hit animation they rarely do over 20pts of damage on avg and I've seen 1pt to many times even at optimal ranage.Bolt Pistol - desipte being the same Caliber of round as a Bolter - with just less range - is worthless - even IF you do hit with it you might do 5 to 10pts - if your lucky... You characters seem to have good Bolt Pistols though... dunno why the rest of the Wolves - namely the Blood Claws - got the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ kind.There are no assault cannon termi's ( something the wolves are famous for ).The Knight's melta cannon ( one of the most powerful weapons in the game  for the pts) can and often does 1 to 10 pts of damage vs vehicles - its better at anti infantry than anti armor - which is not what it is designed to do. The heavy stubber is meh so just use the melta cannon.Even Grot weapons will damage the heaviest armor - yes the blunderbust can be used to take on Landraiders! ( I had a 30pt hit on a LR  ).Orc artillery is AMAZING - the damage and AOE is just beyond words, Wolves Whirlwinds - not so much - infact they are slightly better than Frag Missles - I am willing to bet they share the same values or tables -  damage wise is meh, its better for breaking morale than AOE damage - it can crit/kill but not as often as the Orc artillery.Oh Whirlwinds do♥♥♥♥♥♥vs tanks ( as it should ) but Orc's arty can kill Vehicles - its just better all around. - Maybe that is be design but it sucks.Auto Cannons are under powered  on an avg both vs Armor and Infantry - again I think it is due to the damage tables not having a minimum value despite the strength of the weapon.Melee combatThe orcs will outpower you in melee in a 1 unit vs 1 unit everytime unless you are:1 A special character2 Temi's and Temi THammersBClaws and Jump Inf suck period despite being stronger and better armored traditionally. Bikers are a bit better but since you only get 2 they don't last long either.Over all I think the Chain Sword is the problem - despite the orcs light armor, their high HP's and the CSwords lower damage make it under powered. It is just a matter of numbers in that regard. The chain sword should be better than a stnd melee weapon but the Orcs melee weapons ( not choppa's) are better from what I have seen on avg.The power fist - though designed for armor elimination in mind, is under powered vs vehicles.The Knight's chain weapon is crap - your lucky if you 20pts on average. This is a high str weapon that does crap for damage even against grot killer cans which it should cut like butter. But Grot killer cans can do an amazing 45pts to 90pts vs your Knight.Vehicles shouldn't get ""stuck in"" in melee but they do - be prepared for melee to  stand next to your tanks/speeders so they cannot move... yep thats right, 1 unit of melee can completely imbolize your vehicles despite no WS.No tank shock either, yep you cannot roll over ANY enemy units. They are the best vehicle traps in the universe.TerrianOrcs can shoot you when you cannot shoot them, this applies to:Objects/terrian and height that should block LoSOrc's having Higher Ground - the reverse is not true for you as they can shoot up at you- Mostly on Fortress MapsExperince -Is not shared,  so you have to micro manage your units on who gets the killing blow to get the experience to advance. It would go a long way if the experience was split based on % of damage done. In a sense this limits the player on play style, certain units become usless ( like blood claws ) or just foder so you can level up units that actually have value and can kill.Once leveled you get no choice in what upgrades they get. This is kind of lame as why would I want an aspex on a Gray Hunter unit... Or a Frag on a biker unit that I mainly use for recon... or cerimite armor vs heat weapons that do not exsist. I mean you can go with that, but I think having player choice in that regard would be more pleasing and rewarding, since  you have to micro manage kills. After getting a unit to survie and level up, you get a reward you probably won't like.So in summary -Despite having better armor and equipment in the lore and table, and generally being stronger - they wolves are under powered in a lot of instances in an apple to orange comparison.I think the fault is how they generate their numbers or the spread of their numbers, I do not think there are any minimums so everything can do 1pt despite being a super hvy weapon or weapon with a str vaule of 5+. In this sense the game does a very poor job of reprresenting the Marines weapons.I am not sure how the mechanics work, but maybe its just a numbers things with the orcs, they tend to have more per unit, so they have better value thresholds. That is just a guess, it could be by design and my findings are averages from 1 campaign play through (my 2nd actually). And yes I didn't finish either one, I just couldn't take it anymore but ive logged 60+ hrs.So overall, if you are expecting a fair balanced Single player Campain, you will not find it here. If you LOVE Marines, you will be let down and frustrated in the end like I was.But if you go in with an open mind and do  not expect the game to mirror anything 40k other than looks, you will probably enjoy it but I cannot recommend it to 40k fans. So its uninstall for me - At this point I wish I could get a refund but after 60 hour + of trying to like this game that probably will not happen.Fingers crossed the next one will be better."

And if you like turn-based strategy on pc it brings you close to the experience of the board game.Personally, I’ve waited for such a game for a very long time.I find there’s room for improvement concerning the animation of unit-actions. Unit-actions are performed too slow in my opinion and additionally, actions are sometimes starting with unit-voice-sequences that stretches the whole thing even more.That weakness makes this fine game unnecessarily slow which might disappoint many players who do like a bit more swift gameplay.Altogether good job developers and I’m looking forward to what kind of improvements might come up in the near future!"

It has a ""just one more go"" addictive feel, and the graphics are a close rendition of the models.That said, it's grindingly slow sometimes, particularly in animations in big battles, which was surprising as I ran Dawn of War 2 on the same machine, which is RTS, yet that seemed faster.It could really do with the ability to customise squads like in the tabletop game - that would turn it from a good game into a great one.Still, if you're a 40K fan and/or a turn-based game fan, this is absolutely worth purchasing."

That's lots. And it's good.So, this is a review of the single player campaign as I have not played the game in multiplayer yet, just viewed some youtube battles.It's taken a while but the game has grabbed me by the doodads. In a nice way.You start with a map with a linear progression of battle after battle. There are some scripted well thought out battles interspersed with battles using the skirmish feature of the game. All taking you toward the final battle.Take your units through to the next battle and wait in anticipation to try out their new abilities they gained from the previous battle after levelling up.Its fun.It is not a AAA title. It doesn't have a AAA price tag. Its not how Slitherine does things. But it is cool as a single player comp stomp campaign. Not worth the price if that is solely what you want it for, at the moment.Maybe with new races IF they each have a campaign released with them too.There is a tutorial and the first few battles consist of quite basic army lists and units.But as the campaign prgresses you will swing Thunderhammers and fire off Whirlwinds.It does lack a bit of spit and polish though:There are no cut scenes, no voice-overs and no cinematic intros.There is limited unit customization, no re-naming you Terminators 'Nigel Farage' or 'Trump Hammer' if you are so inclined. Makes me sad...There's very little in the way of engaging backstory for each unit. No tech specs for guns or gun porn. Not even a tiny waaaagh! from the Gremlin units on their unit cards. So yeah, the atmosphere is kind of lacking.There definately needs to be more mention of experience gain and levelling up in game in the tutorial or at the start of the campaign even.There are no skill trees to drool over. Bang a great big GONG when your unit levels up in game. Make the +exp numbers fizz and sparkle! <ahem> I mean have a deep masculine disembodied voice announce how the Emperor is pleased with your efforts! Missed a trick here.The map editor is pretty good, if a little opaque at the moment. No doubt there will be guides coming out from people on steam, and there is reference to some help on the Slitherine webby. But its a pretty decent bit of kit. Can't find out how to make hills yet though.Anyway I would give this 7.5 out of 10.You would like this if you like TT 40K. But it definately needs fleshing out as a Warhammer experience. Great effort."

But, with the large single-player Campaigns plus Skirmish Mode Plus Multiplayer PLUS an editor built-in to be able to design your own scenarios and even campaigns, this game has an exceptional amount of replay value making this a must-own for fans of the genre.In short, a fantastic game and one that I found very easy to recommend!"

So why negative? It seems like people in slitherine don't get it that at least 50% of what makes WH40K so popular is the story (fluff). Here, like in armageddon, there is absolutely no story whatsoever (whell there is few lines of text here and there, but cmon), which ruins the experience quite a bit.

A very nice, turn-based version for one player, Sanctus Reach delivers when it comes to something close to Chaos Gate, except with not as good a sound track and with fewer customisation options. (In other words, not quite as good as the game from 1998, but almost...)So, if the single player version is ok, how about playing with your friends? Well, this is where the game really sucks. The multiplayer version is so bad it is not even funny. They've gone back to a play-by-mail system that completely defeats the point of playing this game with a friend. It might work if you're busy and you have multiple games going on at once. You make a move and then you forget about the game for a while. Who does that today, though? No one?

My issues with this game is the game play and mechanics. Armageddon is a tile based strategy game which was fun it was turn based and you know exactly what you're getting into. This game is trying to be an Xcom-ish 40k with the best of both tile based and squad based tactical combat but fails. I understand RNG in games like Xcom or Wasteland but this game's RNG wants you to punch your monitor.  For example anyone familiar with warhammer 40k knows what a Melta gun can do, Now imagine a melta hitting lets say a gretchin. This is the equivelent of using a flamthrower on an ant, however in this game at medium range the melta damage is listed as low against and gretchin unit in the open (Not in cover) and does little damage.Another issue I have with this game is the damage tables are all over the map. A stormbolter shouldn't be able to do more damage against a vehicle than a terminator with a powerfist. On the Melee topic the space marine units such as blood claws, Wolfguards (With frost weapons,Terminator armor or even a powerfist) when engaged in melee is like watching friday night sissy fights (I get it I've read over 100 warhammer books and played table top Orks are good in close combat however so are ""Hero"" units such as Wolfguard and Terminators) The Orks get reaction hits 100% of the time whereas your Wolfguard maybe gets a hit and for reaction hits you're better off putting a bolt pistol in your mouth and suck starting it. With how many ork units are on every map the damage output of every space marine unit needs to be upped by at least 50% ( A bolter fires an explosive armor piercing round from a semi-automatic or automatic open bolt rifle. Think a Mk-19 on steroids that is in a rifle form) A Melta is a anti everything weapon meant to be a mid ranged anti armor support weapon ( it melts armor and through the melted hole another jet of superheated gases melts everything on the inside hence Melta) Now lets talk about the dreadnaught. The wolf claw should be able to wreck anything it touches however in this game you may as well concede defeat if your dreadnaught gets into close combat (It's a walking mech with insane firepower and armor the only things that can take it out are anti armor weapons, Power weapons or another vehicle deff dread,tank ect.)Deployment is the last issue I have. there is no logic behind it, no wolf lord with intel would deploy a strong contingent of bloodclaws when the enemy army is fielding numerous fast attack or armor units. No he would have long fangs maybe a predator and some dreadnaughts to support the convoy of rhinos. ( I get that you are suppose to bumrush the exit with a rhino and hope he doesn't get swarmed)To the developers I don't know if you're either A Ork bias players or you just fail to grasp what warhammer 40k is about but I recommend you pick up a warhammer 40k rulebook and codex's for races you plan on using and try to implement the strengths and weakness of said races. For Example Orks are dumb but have a ton of numbers, They can jerry rig virtually anything and are super tough i.e they have messed up nerve endings and can't feel pain.  Space Marines are a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. The average space marine can take on up to 100 normal men in hand to hand combat add on the fact his primary weapon fires armor piercing exploding rounds that can literally pulp a person in 1 round or in a large orks case 3-4. Now you take the Space wolves (Think Vikings in space) Very diverse military tactics but also very scary in close combat (Anyone who has played against them or with them on tabletop knows what I'm talking about) The basic infantry is the bloodclaw (Throw away melee unit used in large packs to close with and destroy the enemy) and those that survive are tempered and are elevated to the core infantry the grey hunters (Tactical squads pretty much) Then you have specialized units such as Skyclaws ect I don't want to write the whole codex down.Please in future patches if what you're trying to do is make a tactical  turn based strategy than you need to balance this fast. In the current state I can't recommend this game to anyone who likes Warhammer 40k or turn based strategy games such as Xcom or Wasteland."

76561197970872713,Not Recommended,502370,29363972,Posted: 19 January,all,Ana,"Edit 2: Im 185hrs into the game and I'm not really interested in playing it anymore. The devs have done a marvellous job at addressing some bugs and play issues and most of the things in the negative reviews that players have complained about have been fixed, so the game is shaping up nicely. But if you look through the negative reviews of the game, there's a common complaint that has not been addressed, the lack of an Army Builder for choosing your units. And this one issue is what kills the re-playability of this game.Sanctus Reach randomly generates your force selection each time you play it. There's no way to really choose the units you want. Every game is about the same in terms of the units that are selected for you to choose from and therein lies the rub. It's true Sanctus Reach offers a lot of unit variety. There are a good number of tanks and special units they have put into the game and some campaign missions allow you to sample them. But beyond that, they wont show up in non-campaign Skirmish missions. Land Raiders, for example are so much fun to use. And the Orks need to have access to Warbikers to be competitive in multiplayer, but you'll really never see them listed in your force selection. In fact, in a 6000 point game (current max), you'll be lucky to see more than 2 tanks ever listed. So your force is always comprised of basic foot soldiers, and therefore you'll always be fighting a foot slogger battle which gets boring after a while. You'll never get to play a mechanized assault, or an armored spearhead. Or dabble around with what ifs using different force structure.I've wanted to setup a mission where I have but only 2000 points of Space Wolves vs. a horde of 6000 points of Orks and use mostly tanks for both sides... but Sanctus Reach wont let you. There are hardly any tanks in your list, and it's really sad that you cant customize the enemy army either. The devs have said to use the editor to make custom mechanized missions, And I've tried, but its not easy. I started to learn how to do it and the editor is very powerful, but getting o the end where you actually have a mission to play isnt something I have figured out yet.  I havent seen any tutorials or downloadable campaigns by anyone in the community either. It's one thing to have a quick skirmish mission that you can set up in seconds and entirely another when editing a mission takes countless hours.So the verdict for me is a no, I dont recommend this game because in the long run you're going to get bored of being forced to play every battle using the same exact troops and force structure. Its always a foot slogger ground troop battle each and every time and maybe one or two tanks, three if you get lucky. It becomes dull and repetitive and its not fun anymore. They have all these great units that are fun to play with but it blows my mind that the devs won't let you use them. It really ruins the fun.Edit: I wrote this review after playing it for several hours. You can still read that initial review below. Right now Im 35 hours into the game and its so much fun! Its nearly addictive the more you learn how to get the game to do what you want. This is an Indie title that was just very nicely put together. I'm learning how to make my own scenarios with the game editor with truly EPIC style armies facing off on both sides. This is some of the most fun I've had playing any 40k title in a great while. There's a couple minor issues like the UI and units being a tad clunky to use, but once you spend a few hours playing the game it's a non issue and it all works ok. The Force Organization doesnt spawn a unit list that allows you to field the kind of army you want, you get to be somewhat choosy but its random and flawed. Instead, you'll have to learn how to copy and edit an existing mission if you want the freedom to explore what it's like to have a completely mechanized force with Titans go up against a huge Ork horde. But the nice thing is the game allows you to do pretty much what you want once you start using the editor. Oh, and 35 hours into the game and not ONE single crash. Its coded very well and very stable.Original review:If you like the table top game, FINALLY Straylight Entertainment and Slitherine Ltd. have made a 40k game that gives us just that. This is a table top like experience. It's not like other 40k games. There's a good number of fair to poor 40k games on Steam right now, and this isn't one of those lousy titles. For example, I remember playing Space Marine when it came out and my shoulders slumped when I saw the way you got health was by killing an enemy. What? WTF? Somehow the life essence of a dead ork heals your wounds? Stupid! And then when a jump pack marine lands, every enemy around you gets knocked off their feet in commical fashion. WTF! Stupid and over the top! And then Dawn of War, Oh God where do I start at how ridiculous it was. So If I had a Marine squad in the field that was depleted, I'd just click on reinforce and ""grow"" a new marine next to the other ones. LOL! So Dumb! There isnt any of that silly crap in this game, thank the Emperor!What you get with this game is something that you can sink your tactical and strategic fangs into. But first you'll need to open the game folder and find the MAPVIEW.TXT file and change the 'Pitchlimit' to 35 from 10. That way you can get a models eye level view of the battlefield in addition to free camera rotation, pitch and zoom. That's nice. It sucked before I found that file and changed it. I also noticed there's a lot of text files that seem to make this game quite moddable. Thats good. I'm guessing as is typical GW fashion, there will be expansions for this for all the various armies GW sells. And I bet customizing some new armies might be able to be done with mods.Skirmish mode offers a lot of customization. You can even go into an editor and make your own campaigns or missions. I browsed this a bit and all the tools are there to setup whatever kind of battlefield you can imagine, but I didnt see water tiles... I also couldnt figure out how to raise the map height, but CTRL+Clicking lowered it to create depressions and trenches. That will be fun. As it is, you have about 7 or so different maps and you can pick some more variations of those, customize the weather, unit choices and victory conditions and force points. The last part is pretty exciting for me. The first skirmish I played, I was surprised at how the AI managed to hang on to the VC objectives and even flank me and take one where I wasnt paying attention, but I stomped the AI pretty good. So being able to give the AI more force points allows it to have more units. Or you can setup reinforcements to come in at a certain time. It seems very cool. I cant wait to setup a massive Ork horde and fight them all to the death heroic style.I havent tried the campaign yet, but being able to carry over unit experience will be interesting. What it does I dont know yet, nor how long the campaign is. But seeing that you can create your own campaign leads me to believe that you'll be able to DL other players campaigns and that will be cool if that can be done. There should soon be an enormous replay value. And when other army DLC's come out, oh wow... But for $29.99, I think this game is a STEAL. Its a fun tactical game that plays smart, looks slick, has great terrain and model details, and the units are varied and behave very specifically depending on type. It is much like table top chess with stuff that shoots guns, rockets and flame throwers, with skimmers, jump troops, and mini-Titans! I'm loving it so far. I've read there is also a hotseat mode whereby you can have a friend over and fight an entire battle from one computer. I'll update this review later, but I'm off to play this game, over and over and over... you cant do that on a table top game. Takes too long. In thirty minutes, I can get a 2000 point game over and done with. Awesome!"

,Not Recommended,502370,29364570,Posted: 19 January,all,Lord_Eol,"Update: Keeping original though new review as I gave the game a second try after the recent patches:Still can't bring myself to recommend the game after the recent patches but the game has went from unplayable clean it with fire to meh, OK and decent eye candy but really don't expect much and would really only recommend on a 50% off steam sale.So first off I completed the game, took about 11 hours and zero replayability.  The lack of story (as others have complianed) makes it feel more like a tabletop simulator than a single player game and the non-story missions are a waste of time, they are simply time wasting fluff.  Basically it goes ""story mission 3/4 generic missions, repeat"" until end of game.  They fixed some of the UI problems (though things like ""left handed"" or ""left/right handed"" option still confusing, like I still don't know WTF is the active option when I have it selected) but other UI items are still broke mostly at the tactical level, i.e. LOS is still impossible to figure out especially around cover and for that matter, how cover even works is a complete blackbox. And don't say the ""information"" map button, that is useless, the colors mean nothing I can discern and that doesn't help with planning future movement.  Also the selection mechanism is still kludgy and can often lead to misorders.On the mission level I find mandatory limit discrimination annoying. I can understand mission progression unlocking units (I don't like it but it's a video game trope so I can't complain) but I am annoying after I unlock them I can't take any unit in my army into the battle (limited by force selection points OFC).  Also the game suffers from the lack of unit permadeath (or if you want to be nicer, unit damage).  There simply is no reason to give a ♥♥♥♥ about your units as they can only progress, death doesn't cause removal from the game or even a significant (injury lets say) downsize in future missions.On units the lack of variety is bothersome, there really isn't a lot of meaningful difference among like units (i.e. all vehicles are basically interchangable as are all infantry), the lack of options which the real game has (when leveling or even weapon selection on certain units) is annoying, and the hero's are pretty underwelming.The game has improved but now it's basically just a boring grind and you are basically playing the identical mission every time, simply no reaosn to every play more than mission one outside getting new units at the very end.  And don't say multiplayer saves it, it doens't.  The game lacks the depth the tabletop has for multiplayer.--------------OLD REVIEW----------------Edit: For typo, no content changedBought, played, requested refund.  No complaints on the graphics but the UI is attrocious to the point it's unplayable.  You can't filter out units with no actions left, you have no idea on actual ranges (i.e. range 4, well how far is that actually on the game map), line of sight, and the entire overwatch system makes absolutely any sense from a spacemarine combat perspective, ditto the  melee combat system.  For that matters rules are light everywhere from flamers to moral (breakpoints) etc.  Plus you run into issues that game development has solved over a decade ago such as ambigioius option menu selection ""If it says screenshake disable does that mean it disabled NOW or click it to disable it, oh wait it changed and now says enable, etc .. what is the current damn state!!"" to the abilty to configure mouse wheel zoom speed (currently insanely slow).  Also not sure why they limit the tactical map zoom out as I know the it's an artificial limit (as the unit placemenet/selection screen has inifinte zoom out), makes no damn sense.What I was promised and expected (from the youtube and reviews on here) was a half decent tabletop 40K recreation and what I got was a game that has absolutely no relationship to the actual rules and mechanics of the real game as far as I can tell that looks OK.  Basically all I was hoping for was a a higher quality better looking more tactical scale Armageddon (i.e. Panzer General reskinned it turns out) but I get I'm not quite sure what, something that reminds of half♥♥♥♥♥Warhammer: Rites of War.Game has potentional but right now I would still call it a early beta and I""m not funding your ""possible"" future/continued development.  Release a finished product and patch or you can just wait a year or two before I take a second look at you.  Fix your damn UI while your at it, that would at least make it palatible."

It feels like a waste of dev time and of mine, and it seems clear the pretty 40k skin is the only thing that kept me going for more than an hour. What I'm particularly bitter about is that this *should* be a game I love : I'm a 40k fan, played TT, love turn based strategy, and generally don't care much about shiny looks. But even with that, I can't bring myself to like this game.Pros- 40k license- sound basis (turn based, deployment choices, damage system)Cons- one of the worst UIs in recent memory. I can work with ugly, but this is so far from user friendly it's down right user hating. Something as trivial as selecting unit is terribly terribly implemented. Very obviously necessary information is nowhere to be seen (LoS previews ?). Some displayed information seems flat out wrong.- The campaign barely merits being called that. It's an endless string of brainless ""have more capture points after x turns"", with said points not mattering because just click your units at theirs and they die (yay difficulty). The story is effectively non existent.- Technically feels 2005-ish. Everything is ugly, low res, post processing may or may not exist at all."

It is basically a mobile game and feels like it was designed to be played with a touch screen. It's also seemingly quite buggy, as in enemies spawn right behind and beside you and in areas that you can see. The AI seems off, they have no concept of cover, and they will do something almost completely random if you load a save repeatedly. A broken squad of boys yelled ""RUN!"" and then proceeded to capture my objective on their turn. It's a bad copycat of XCOM style combat.Everything about this game just feels cheap and like little to no effort was put into it. People are saying that this feels like the tabletop, and its the 40k game that we needed, but this is yet to be shown to me. I am a dedicated 40k fan, video games and tabletop, and this game REALLY feels like another steaming pile taking advantage of that. It is not like the tabletop, forget about AP or any semblance of armour because health bars are what you will be dealing with. Weapon/ballistic skill, toughness, and strength values are all missing. Somehow a unit of boys are tougher than your space marines in power armour...I cannot stress enough that you should not pay full price for this. It's cheap and shoddy, but would have made a fine game on a phone. I don't understand the positive reviews for this, it's like i am playing a different game."

Yeah, it's decent, but it's dissapointing because it's a run of the mill turn based game that is a waste of the liscense. There is nothing in this game that hasn't been done to death before, and don't expect a faithful recreation of the tabletop game, because it isn't. It's another game milking the liscense by exploiting 40k fans. It works, you can enjoy it, but it's one of the most bland, uninspired, ""ok"" games I've ever played. Take the most standard turn based formula you can think of and apply a 40k aesthetic to it, and you get this. Sure, you don't need to innovate to make a good game, but you could at least apply more stylistic flair to make it stand out, but it doesn't even do that. I wouldn't  call it shovelware, but it's just so... underwhelming.  It's an ok game but it doesn't get any better than that. It's the most basic turn based combat formula you can think of, with the difficulty coming from A.I that is hard, not because it's actually good, but because they throw a bunch of Orkz at you. Sure Orkz come in hordes, but I'm pretty sure it's an excuse to not program good enemies.  Just one more fine example of GW whoring their IP to any video game developer that wants to cash in on it. Go do yourself a favor and get either Dawn of War or Space Marine instead,they aren'treally comparable but both are competent uses of the liscense.Dawn of War is cheaper and Space Marine goes on sale often, both are much, much, MUCH better games, and they are excellent games,  not just good by 40k video game standards. Or absolutely wait for this to go on sale, it isn't worth $30 when there are better games around that price or cheaper."

There is a decent level of complexity in the combat system with line of sight, morale, zones of control, armour and armour penetration all being taken account, and a large number of melee/ranged weapons, units and vehicles for the two base game factions (Space Marines and Orks).
