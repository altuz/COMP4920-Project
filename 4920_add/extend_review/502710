,Recommended,502710,24696380,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,Wavefunction,"Pros:- Polished, decent graphics, great atmosphere, great sound.- Setting is top notch. Very cinematic.- Runs great on my VR-entry level system (i5 2500k + GTX 980).- Quite immersive.- Quite challenging.- Fills a niche quite admirably.Cons:- Weapon mechanics are simple/lacklustre.- The AI is very simplistic, based on the two missions I played. The enemies follow a set path and shoot at you from set points along that path. It gets repetitive quickly so it's good the missions don't drag on.Overall it's worth the $10 and better than the vast majority of short VR games on Steam. It does need a bit of work though, or else more discerning VR users with more games under their belt will come back and will have a lot of not so nice things to say about it in a year. I hope the developer continues to improve upon the AI and gameplay mechanics.**EDIT 2016/08/10**: The most recent update improved the AI dramatically."

,Recommended,502710,24694972,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,Fakedawg,"If you like The Nest, chances are you will like this one as well. It is a fun little sniper style game, but with 4 different settings, 2 as a sniper, one as a MG gunner  and one as a dual wielding sub machine gunner. Graphics look nice, and it makes good use of roomscale.It does have some room for improvements though, gun angle and scope custimization like in The Nest would be great for those of us using homemade rifle adapters (angle is quite a bit off if you use a stock like I do), and I think something is a bit weird with the ballistics/hit system, I got 105 % hits even though I don't think i hit several enemies with the same bullets. I also find it a bit hit and miss wether I actuallty hit or not, it seems to me as if I register a hit in the enemy model, but they keep on going just the same, even at very short ranges.Given a little more dev love in the upcoming weeks this is a game that is well worth the price. It runs very smoothly on my 980ti and I would reccomend it if you would like to shoot something that is not of zombie, alien or robot origin (and neon colored) for a change."

There's only about an hour of content, but the scene where you have to jump out of a plane into anti-aircraft flak shocks the conscience when you know 13,000 people actually did that. Then there's the beach at Normandy, too. It fulfilled the developer's stated description of wanting to take you there. Making the player play the axis side at Normandy was an interesting choice, I wonder why we aren't playing both sides of Normandy and the paradrop. On one level, wielding dual SMGs is fun a fun break from the historical accuracy."

The experience one can have playing through this game is so incredible, that I feel that it would be a shame to not add this title to your library. For anyone with a VR headset that can run this (just VIVE?) must give this a go. There are three different game modes, 5 maps and I believe the game is under constant development. It is worth the price hands down and if you are unsure whether or not to buy it, ask yourself this: do I want to have just about the most incredible VR WWII Experience possible?

That jump was actually quite good and I almost fell on my butt IRL when I landed on the house.Only problem is that the AI gets repetitive (within the same level) and each time I try to look through the scope, the screen blurs, hence making it hard for me to shoot soldiers from a far.

,Not Recommended,502710,33872986,Posted: 28 July,all,bwc153,"Cool concept, but falls short.    There's too little content - I've played the entire game through with my meagre playtime, including 10 minutes or so of getting the game to work correctly (This was my fault, I'm still new to VR stuff and hadn't set my SteamVR up correctly).     Handling the sniper rifle is awkward and unrealistic, and several weapons have rate of fire bugs, such as the MG42 and the suppressed pistol used in the final level, that prevent you from firing as fast as you should be able to.    Additionally it's possible to ""jam"" the sniper rifle and shotgun where it looks like it's been bolted/pumped but requires pumping or bolting it again for it to function.Enemy AI is very basic, and seems to follow pre-set paths and makes little opportunity to flank you beyond their scripted paths.  Enemy variety is also lacking,  either you run into enemy soldiers using SMGs (or MG42s in the last level) or riflemen who act as rapid-fire snipers. Additionally, the enemy does not attempt more ""complex"" behavior such as closing the distance to melee you, or throwing grenades.Unfortunately, it appears the game is dead as the developer is working on Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator.   Refunding, but if they add more content I'll probably purchase it again."

I had reservations when I bought it because it looked like it might not be too great.  All I can say is I'm glad I only paid 5 bucks for it, because that's really about all it's worth.The graphics are great and the guns are easy to control but that's where it all ends.  The AI is very basic, the gameplay is basic and runs poorly.  Enemies don't care about incoming fire and will run at you regardless if it's into a hail of bullets.  The gameplay is incredibly linear as enemies take a standard approach towards you.  It was a very weak experience, with very few missions and I got bored of it very quickly.This game follows the standard VR game right now, a wave shooter that isn't polished very well.  This is a game you would expect back in the 90's except in VR, and the market is FLOODED with games like that right now and it is not doing the VR market any favors."

Yes it's light in the pants... most of these things are as developers are chucking together whatever they can with whatever SDK templates they use in order to capitalize from sales.However, this very succinct title is the first time I felt in awe of war while playing a game about it. Sure it's not the most detailed of games or the most deep, but when you are in a broken building, looking down over a German occupied street, and you see the automaton severly basic UI, you think meh... but when it adds in the other touches such as the planes flying over top and bombing the area you are in, it gives you the opportunity to at least experience a glimpse of the 3D experience war might give.It's worth it to experience the war aspect....I just wish it was a full fledged game, rather than 4 little shooting gallery experiences.Either way... I want a WW2 game now. I don't care if you can't run around. If you were able to have interactive paths to go to the sniper portions, I'm fine with that. Tailgunner, naval gunner, helicopter gunner, and whatever else you can shoe horn in there, would make it like a tour or all the terrible♥♥♥♥♥♥our relatives had to go through.Firing a machine gun down at the beaches as the Americans storm, only to get to your encampment and enter your pillbox... you fumble to shoot them with your hand gun...it's a frightening experience.

,Recommended,502710,24767474,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,TheUltimateHuman,"I wasn't expecting much going in but this game was surprisingly great. The developer logo scene was really cool, despite how stupid that sounds. There's some room for improvement, most notably with the enemies and their ai. It is very simple, they move from pre-destined point to point, and then come to the flanking position behind you if they make it all the way through without you killing them (with the exception of the last level, where they just come in waves to the same few locations and then move closer if not killed in a timely manner). Even without a massive upgrade to ai, a few more routes at least for them to take would make things a bit more interesting. The one thing that I feel is a big spot to improve is enemy reactivity to damage. It just doesn't feel good to land a chest shot and have the enemy not even flinch until the second one kills them. Wounding mechanics would be great, but at the very least I would like it if on the ""real life""  mode you and the enemies were one shot kills, instead of what seems to just be another standard difficulty level. Enemies dying quickly to bullets would greatly enhance this experience imo. I also think they are a little bit too accurate on the third mission, Omaha,but that might just be me.  A smaller issue I had was with the text in the menu, it seems to be completely bugged, displaying nonsensical results like 0% accuracy in the first mission but everything else the same. After I played the first mission for the first time, they claimed I had over 4,000 total shots fired, which seems unlikely to me. Also, the text seems to always be on top, which was disorienting and confusing as it appears to be far away, but when you move your hands to where they should be in front of it, it moves in front of them.Despite those issues, this is a good buy at $10, and a good experience,   and I would be excited to see any updated content."

,Not Recommended,502710,28910519,Posted: 1 January,all,Rakon,"Sadly this VR minigame wasn't worth my time.I was excited by the opening level, where you have to jump out of an airplane, with flak guns shooting all around you as you descend to the ground. But it was all downhill from there. The shooting  mechanics are awful; you have to hold the sniper rifle more than a foot in front of your face since you can't really see clearly through the scope if you hold it too close, and there's no way to stabilize the gun, apart from putting your physical arm underneath the gun hand, which doesn't look or behave naturally in-game. It would at least be better if the secondary hand could stick to the front of the rifle for some stabilization. It would be even better if the rifle wouldn't ghost through the building/windows, allowing the building itself to stabalize the weapon. (The Omaha beach level had this only because the gun was a permanent fixture.)For guns that you have to reload, the reloading mechanic is just dump. You squeeze the grips and a new magazine just floats in front of you and you have to line it up with the gun... reloading mechanics can be tricky because of the shape of the controllers, but this is definitely not the way to do it.I could forgive all of the above though if the levels were even remotely difficult or interesting. The AI is worthless and uninteresting; you just shoot them for a few minutes and the level is over. That's the whole (mini)game -- at least until you get to the last level, which was added recently. The Eagle's Nest level seems to be an attempt at a more traditional FPS game adapted for VR, where you actually have to move around to infiltrate a building to kill Nazis in the mountains. Sadly it uses an extremely clunky teleportation mechanic to do this, and for the early part of it you just teleport right behind each Nazi, who is always conveniently facing away from you, and shoot them point blank. Once you get inside the building it gets... ""better"", but not good, and it's over very quickly.VR is still in its infancy but there are already much better shooters you can play."

Reach over the gun with my left hand? Wow. Really realistic, guys.Not only is the weapon unusable, but the game is terrible on top of it. For a game that claims to give you the experience of fighting in World War II, it is more like an arcade shooting galery. No immersive sound, braindead ai, poor level graphics/design. I'm returning this post haste. Do not buy."

It doesn't work like this, neither in game nor in real life. Hard to aim and feel very strange.The machineguns have terrible accuracy. It is supposed to create a feeling of realistic shooting but having a spread of 5 meter at 100 meter distance is over the top. Seriously one can do much better than that in reallife archery. If the gun is that crap D-Day would be a cake walk but history says no."

Nazis yes the third thing that is OK to kill in real life and in VR, Just when I thought that the only fodder I would ever kill in my Vive HMD would be already dead or never alive along comes this game. Thank Adolph for that!What I liked:Well killing Nazis for one who doesn't like the chance to put it up em' as a famous WW2 Home Guard Sergeant would say.The parachuting out of the plane another idea that I thought I would of seen sooner incorporated into VR games.Reminding me what it was like when I first played the original MOH or CODThe Fun of being able to be what we all want to be, long range killer.Throwing a rock at a Nazi and smashing his square head in.What could be improved:The AI maybe a little smarterSome of the weapons could be a little better.Overall a very good game by 1 Dev that puts to shame some of the other games released for the Vive by studios with many Devs.I give this 4♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out of 5"

It gets super repetetive with shallow gameplay. You just look and shoot and there is no sense of danger. When the novelty of the tech catches up one is forced to look at games for what they are and this is boring. This is a cash grab for $10 if you ask me, when I played the game I was stunned that it was over? Its the first WTF moment I have had since joiningh steam and if I had learned about the refund policy when buying then I would have used it. Put this game out for $2.99 and my review would be different...slightly."

76561198026539571,Not Recommended,502710,25561872,"Posted: 17 September, 2016",all,Spanks Masterson,"This is a WW2 shooting game where--in at least one mission--you play as a Nazi. And it's not as if there's a morally-ambiguous buffer for your emotions: you are in a well-protected concrete bunker overlooking a French beach and mowing down incoming Allied troops with a machine gun. You're not misreading this. You are literally one of the guys in a pillbox shredding Allied troops by the dozens as they try to liberate France on D-Day.In terms of sheer tastelessness, the developer would be hard-pressed to have come up with a worse scenario. The only ""mission"" more tasteless would be if you played as a Nazi at a concentration camp. It's a time management mission where you see how many minorities you can gas before the Allies get there! What fun!I'm fine with playing on the side of the historical ""bad guys"" in a video game as long as the game maker chooses the scenario well. This particular implementation was not chosen well. Then again, I'm aware that not everyone playing this had family who bled out on a Normandy beach. As such, there probably should be two game paths to go down: one for Allied and one for Axis, thus if someone had an issue with the Axis games they could simply choose to ignore them. Or at the very least, they could ""sample"" them at leisure as opposed to the current setup where you are forced to participate as a Nazi to progress.ALL THAT SAID, and despite my negative rating, the rest of the game is quite fun. The parachuting was probably the most entertaining. Relatively good stuff all around. In fact, if it weren't for the butchering-of-US/UK/Canadian-troops-by-the-boatload part of the game, this review would be very different! The developer produced an excellent game and if you can overlook the poor choice of mission selection which I've already described, then you might wish to consider this game.Addendum: After posting this review and experiencing responses from a developer who is color blind to different perspectives, pushed me to change my review, and then when I wouldn't change it, put me on the receiving end of his orchestrated attempt to negatively manipulate my review with mass downvotes all ultimately boils down to: I cannot and will not ever support this gentleman again.

Also, the last and final level is a huge disappointment. The level seems like it had good ideas behind it, but was poorly excecuted and just ends up being frustrating to play through dozens of times to beat.
