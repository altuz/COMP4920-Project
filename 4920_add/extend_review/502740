,Not Recommended,502740,32494422,Posted: 16 June,all,Cliffy,"This starts with an interesting concept, a time limited strategy game, in a rather minimalist style. However, that concept is marred by several design flaws that prevent this from being a truly fun experience.While it is nice the game has different nations, religious bonuses, units, and building types, the simple fact is that nothing is balanced. At least two of the nations are unplayable except for those gamers looking for an excessive challenge. Two of the religions unlocked via play are 'must have', while the others can be safely ignored without impeding your enjoyment or effectiveness. The cost of buildings, expecially the higher level ones, are far too expensive for the comparative minimal benefits they grant.The balance between the various units is better, although still lacking, especially considering the wholly random nature of attacks launched against you. This randomness also works against the game, as there is no true curve to the difficulty as the game progresses; it's simply a series of peaks and valleys. It is both annoying and frustrating to go from two millitiamen in one battle, to twenty knights and archers in the next. Since the game ends as soon as all of your units are defeated, and since you cannot predict, or even guess, what will be attacking you at any given time, you cannot stop focusing on developing your army, which, at mid to late game, limits what you are really able to do, where in most games with any type of upgrades, your options are more open and meaningful as you progress.That said, I have put a decent amount of time into the game, and will likely play it for a few minutes here and there. I believe this is the best way to play this game, in small chunks, with plenty of time between sessions, when you have nothing else to do. As such, I will not fully recommend this game, since I assume the vast majority of gamers would rather play something that will hold their attention longer, or at least have slightly more long-term potential."

You try to survive waves of attacks for 50 years which is equal to 50 rounds. The further the game goes on the bigger the waves of enemies there are. The art is very nice to look at and one of the things I most enjoyed about this game. The battles were cool to watch especially when there were waves of soldiers of different types. You can choose from different races to play as, different skill branches to upgrade on, and different strategies to play by. When it's on sale it's definitely worth it.

Generally, you have to effectively manage your budget to purchase buildings (which have various passive effects) and units (who will face enemy units at the end of the turn).Replayability is right there - you can choose between ~10 factions, plus the games offers  achievements  and difficulty levels.  Even though it's Early Access, I haven't run into any unbalanced things or crashes.Very cozy coffeebreak strategy game with great potential. You should give it a chance!"

For example, once you've learned the games core mechanics, which isn't difficult, you can get three Achievements per victory, one for winning with the faction, the other for playing it on hard, and the third for banishing/ignoring the Devil.  As for ""Special Games"" they can all be done on very easy mode for the Achievements.  After that there's only a dozen or so specific Achievements which aren't really that difficult, stuff like recruit a certain unit or acquire a certain blessing, all pretty easy and straightforward.This isn't a game where you can expect endless hours of fun, there is finite level of fun to be had here and it's measured in hours."

Each game takes around a half hour, but different approaches are encouraged and give a different gameplay experience. The various difficulties are well-balanced; the easiest is entertaining but not challenging, normal mode takes a little practice, and I have yet to try the most difficult. The art is beautiful, it's an aesthetically excellent game.While this is an early release, it's 100% playable, and feels like a final release.

I'm so glad to see this fun little game made with such beautiful graphics. It definately has a lot of replay value as a quick 10-15 minute game (or 5 minutes if you don't do so well) The major pro and con to this game is the same: It's short. You get a full game out of it, but each game really is short. Thankfully, the developers decided to put in custom battles which I have yet to try, but it is a new feature that looks like it adds more life to the game. Definately worth $5 and I'm glad to support an indie developer!"
76561197995669628,Recommended,502740,28436897,"Posted: 17 December, 2016",all,Sorokonojka,"50 years is addicting resource management game.Every few turns get attacked so you have to find a balance between building economy and military. There are several different modes but no endless at the time of this review. Considering that I like this game it really sucks that you can only play for 50 turns.At the start of the game, you can choose between several nations that give starting bonuses. Some are better than other but you can always make it harder on yourself and pick a weaker one ( there are achievement for playing each nation )Combat is automatic and has some luck attached to it because units hit random targets. I am not sure if its a good or bad thing but it least you can't 100% predict what happens. When playing on very hard it is very important to find right army composition and it will challenge you.There are 3 different late game units that rely on different resources. You can commit to a specific unit type or find a balance between them. You can also go on random quests that may give units or buildings as a reward .Skill tree has 25 perks. Last skill in each route requires 4 skills before it. You can either choose to commit to a specific skill path or find a balance between them.Music is relaxing and does not distract from thinking. There is no much animation but in this genre, I look for decision making and not good looks.Score : 7/10 . Very simple but enjoyable resource management game that can be played in different ways. Every wrong choice can snowball your loss so there is a good amount of decision making  .It took me about 4 hours to figure out how to beat very hard difficulty so I really wish there was endless mode and maybe leaderboards."
,Recommended,502740,30377211,Posted: 7 March,all,Kaminari-sama,"I'll keep it short. 50 years is exactly how the description describes it, it's a simple little strategy game with game sessions than can easily be completed under an hour within titled 50 years(turns). Despite its simplistic design it offers enough depth to warrant several playthroughs, there are several fractions that offer different bonuses, few special mods and  4 religions(basically tech trees), combining these makes for many several effective strategies to succeed and thus reason to keep playing for hours.Art is easy on eyes and as you see from screenshots pretty, it's nice looks are complemented by calm relaxing music which perfectly suits recreational purpose of this game.The Game is also good for achievement hunting if you're interesting in this type of thing, they are easy to get. This bring me to the difficulty. The learning curve is short and after few playthroughs you will know how things work and even the hardest difficulty will pose not much of a challenge. So if you're looking for a hard strategy game this is not the game you want but if you just want to relax in evenings but still put your braincells to work a little it's worth the price."

You are the leader of a nation who decides what to do as long as you have the resources.What you can do in this game is;Choose your nationBuild structures and hire soldiersGet bonuses from religions and cavesMain point of this game is that this is a fast-paced strategy game which may be finished in less than 30 minutes. I like this alternative. Although gameplay feels repetitive, you can increase the difficulty for a challenge. Overall, this is a fine game."

One playthrough takes about forty-five mintes, max. Gameplay is deceivingly simple, with complicated balances and resource scarcity making even the easier modes a challenge. Combat is hands-off, but executed well, so no complaints on that. Balancing still needs some work, but not much. There is little instruction on how to start, but there's not much to figure out, and as many playstyles as you can imagine are available due to the flexibility of the system. For a little casual game, this hits it out of the park. 10/10, and that's not a compliment I give lightly."

,Recommended,502740,32287069,Posted: 9 June,all,bad_rain,"A pleasant surprise.You don't really expect much from a 5$ game, but 50 Years is pretty enjoyable.This quick, ""coffee-break"" strategy game is more like FTL than Civilization. In span of 50 turns you're tasked with a simple mission - build up your kingdom and raise an army to tackle various enemies. All mechanics are rather shallow, but this was not meant to be a complicated game. This said, basic management of resources is needed and a bit of thinking ahead.50 Years suffers from a couple of annoyances - 4:3 resolution, no save option (minor gripe, sessions last for 20 minutes, but it should be implemented nevertheless). Still, technical issues are not major.I won't be too harsh on minimal graphics or sounds, but the art style is decent enough. You won't be really spending hours in this game, but for whats it worth .... it's quite good.TL;DR :Nice twist on strategy genre, with a rougelite influence. Good in short bursts."

Initial simplicity continues to allow depth and finesse as you guide your chosen culture through the trials of the 50 years the title promises. Simple decisions turn to fiendish puzzles...and I still cannot quite fathom why I care so much! And the pièce de résistance - each game is over in half an hour or probably less!If you spend a few moments playing this you will not regret it...and if you love it as much as me you'd happily sell it your soul.

,Recommended,502740,34192835,Posted: 12 August,all,IFIYGD,"Overall Rating 8.5/10Interesting little, short time war strategy game. ""Short time"" meaning you can complete a campaign in a hour or two, no weeks-months needed to win or lose a game. Not terribly complex, but not too simple. Some attention and thinking is needed, but not so much that the game isn't suitable for more casual gamers, looking for an enjoyable time-killer, that requires enough thought to keep you engaged for the hour or 2 you are playing it. For more hardcore war/battle strategy players... no, it's not going to be like any of the CIV or Total War games. But might be just the time killer you want if you are a single genre addict.Pros:Easier difficulty settings are great for more casual players or newbies to war/battle strategy games. The higher difficulty levels do require good strategy and planning, making them good for more hardcore players looking for something to play and complete quickly.Old school style gaming, no overly complex mechanics, graphics or systems you need to learn. Easy to learn, a bit challenging to master (I'm still working on that... lol!)Runs great on toasters, really old, crispy-fried toasters. basic laptops and office machines could run this just fine. (Don't tell your boss I recommended it to you, if they catch you playing it instead of working...)Pleasant, if somewhat boring music, crisp and clean  graphics, if you like simple and  ""old school"" (no grand animations, splashing blood and gore... think simplfied Monty Python's Flying Circus style line art with limited colors...).Cons:Price- maybe a bit much at full price for what you get, though $5 USD isn't terrible either. I recommend waiting for a sale.Starts off a bit too simply, feels uninspired on the first campaigh (Americans). Don't toss it aside though- the different cultures and their limitations and ""buffs"" (no xxx can be hired, or no xxx resources produced, but + xxx gold, faith or free units) and the choices in belief systems andThe Devil Chickenchoices make it get more interesting as you go.TL;DRFun, little time killer, just complex enough to make it easy to learn but hard to master. DEVIL CHICKEN and Zombie Chicken minions, Unicorns, Hydras, Minotaurs, Angels, Exorcists and your own Zombie Chickens fighting in your army!  It's fun, not too easy, not too complex.  I am enjoying it, 6.5 hours in at the time of ths review. I know I will be playing many more short campaigns in the future. Trading Cards and Achievements as well, so it's a win for me.

,Recommended,502740,25585807,"Posted: 19 September, 2016",all,MooCows,"A simple, but entertaining, little time-waster.50 Years comprises of trying to keep your village alive for 50 turns against progressively larger AI armies that attack randomly. You'll recruit peasants to earn gold, build barracks to recruit more swordsmen, logging cabins to get lumber for recruiting archers, stables to get knights, etc.When a battle occurs you have the option to use a scroll (a consumable that typically debuffs the enemy in some fashion), or draft any number of your peasants to fight as militia (each peasant drafted will not produce any income for that turn, however). After you click to start the battle your involvement ends, and you watch helplessly as events play out and your preparations either prove sufficient, or woefully inadequate.A single playthrough takes about 20-30 minutes at most. However, the game has several different factions, each with their own unique perk (some more useful than others), as well as several Faith/skill trees to experiment with and multiple difficulty settings to give the game a decent measure of replayability.50 Years is best suited to being played in brief spurts when you have a little bit of time to kill, but not enough to dive into a more prolonged experience. To that end, I would like to see the devs add a Save & Resume function if possible, so you can stop and pick up where you left off even more easily. The game also seems well suited to mobile platforms - it could be the perfect thing for killing a little time on your phone while in the waiting room at the doctor's office."

Some pieces are worthless, try to find some value for them. Same goes for nationalities, come up with deeper, more unique characteristics. Take out the part that skips battles.

On the positive side, that means you can find an optimum build strategy for whatever kingdom or variant you're playing, hence the puzzle-like nature. On the negative, once you've beaten it with a particularly kingdom there isn't much point in doing it again.For $5, it's hard to go wrong.
