My elementary school friends and I would work together to solve the games' puzzles and understand the intricacies of the game mechanics. Whenever a new entry into the series came out, we'd each stay up really late, if not all night, playing it, so that when we met up at school later we could share our experiences.  Man, those were the days.I got a real hit of nostalgia when I loaded up Quest for Glory 1 just now and saw the classic Sierra logo pop up along with its theme song.  I don't think I can express how much I'm looking forward to playing through these games again."
,Recommended,502750,25251588,"Posted: 30 August, 2016",all,JayEatsBrains,"I remember this game like my oldest, dearest friend. I'd come home, and my friend will be there waiting for me. There'd be tales of great adventurers, none quite like the other; the warrior and his mighty sword and strength; the wizard's cunning and secret society hidden among the swirling sands of Shapier; and the thief whose shadow is all that is seen. These are tales long since forgotten, and it's good to see them back again.This game does one thing that I've not seen be mainstream or ever (or at lest very seldomly) done. You can save your endgame character (with all the buffed up stats) from the first game and import that character to the sequel. You can begin your new adventure with a familiar character and be a thief/warrior/magic user in a new world with new stuff to do and learn. You don't just play an adventurer. You ARE the adventurer.I can't recommend this game enough. If Steam had an icon for two thumbs up, I'd click. Then, I'd ask for another button that has 20,000 thumbs up and it still wouldn't be enough. It's only $10. Buy it. Play it with the wonder of being brought to a new world. You'll love it.UPDATE: November 10, 2016I see a lot of people are having trouble with importing characters. Here's how to do it:In order to import characters, save the imported character file to the ""C:\"" drive. Now, it won't actually be in your real C: drive. However, saving to the game's C:\ drive places it in the same folder as the game.For example, if you beat QFG1 and save your imported character to C:\, the import file should be located in your \steamapps\ folder in the QFG1 folder.Now, to load an imported character, you copy and paste the import file to the main folder of the next game. In other words, save your QFG1 import file in the QFG2 folder. Then, when you're importing a character, look for the file in QFG2's ""C:\"" drive."

(QfG 1 is the earliest example I know that is loosely non-linear; you still have to achieve the same things, and usually in a specific order, but there are almost always multiple solutions to each step.)The stories are all loosely set in the same universe, and based around a particular cultures mythology. The writing, dialogue and characters put most modern titles to shame; QfG has every drop of charm and wit you see in series like King's Quest, but also has humor in buckets.QfG take the very best of point-and-click (masterful story-telling, characters, clever puzzles) and early ARPGS (stat based & free-form character development) then mashes them together into something amazing. From memory, it was a husband and wife team that did the bulk of the work on these games (at least the first four?) and it shows. The games (even the EGA version of 1 and 2) all feel hand-crafted. I don't know how else to explain it. They're a work of art.At this price, it's almost criminal; if you're into story driven RPGs, there is literally hundreds of hours of entertainment to be had here. Buy. Buy now."

After 20 years of playing the series, I still start each game with the same sense of fun I started with.  This series is well told, with an entire world, lore, characters, magic and strategies to learn.  It would not be an exaggeration to say that this diverse story and characters taught me to not only enjoy reading and storytelling, but learning about the entire cornucopia of mythologies and legends the Coles pulled from when designing this brilliant series.And you aren't limited in your playing style, and once is far from over!  Play as a Fighter who can cast spells.  Or next time, a Magic-User who can pick locks!  And when you are finished the first game, take your character with you to the next game in the series, and continue the story.  Then do it again with games 3, 4 and 5.  This feature adds layers upon layers to the replayability of not just one game, but multiple games!And if anyone loves speedrunning... try this game.  There are multiple classes, and avenues, and methods.  :)  I recommend it to everyone."

If you've never experienced it before and are thinking about picking this game set up, you cannot/will not find a better deal.These games will last and be on your steam favorites.You can choose between a fighter, wizard, or thief, and after the second game, if your fighter has done enough honorable deeds, you can become a paladin.I have so many memories of these games that I could go on and on and on. My favorite thing about them is that you can play your character through ALL five games. If you beat the first one, you can save your character and import him into the second, if you beat the second you can import him into the third, and so on and so forth. There is only one weak game in the series, in my opinion, which is the fifth, but it's still a great game. MUST BUY.Highly recommended."

The only game where i've replayed it countless times and never got bored of it.It has the typical classes to choose from - Fighter, Magic user, Thief and later in the series, Paladin. The QFG series took the story telling genre to a whole new level - character development and masterful storytelling, coupled with a great soundtrack.If you want a series that centers around you as a HERO that saves everyone from a disaster and reccuring characters who accompany you through the series, you should look no further. Thank You and ♥♥♥♥ you Sierra for developing/ending this wonderful series and forever grateful to Lori Ann Cole for your incredible grasp on storytelling."

These games have a strong narrative that pulls you along, interesting NPC's, humor, fighting, options for each class to resolve problems, forces you to explore and figure things out on your own, upgrades to your character and gear.

If you've never played these games then trust me YOU WANT TO BUY THIS. 10 dollars is a steal for the amount of enjoyment you can get from these games.The games are beautiful (both in music and art style), humurous, dramatic, sometimes even a bit scary, everything you could ever ask for in a fantasy adventure and then some.Even better they have a lot of replay value with different classes, the ability to multi-class (be several classes at once) and various ways to complete every task in each game depending on your class. The ending of each game could be dramatically different depending on what class you pick and how you play the game as you go. Picked magic user but feeling a bit poor? Give yourself points in lock picking and join the thieves guild. A fighter with magic and want to use it in combat? Easy...just drop your shield, now you have a long sword and a free hand to cast spells.You can even save your characters at the end of each game to be used in the next game as these games were the first of their kind to begin using this method to draw you more into the story, giving each play through a personal feel as you take your hero through his journey from start to finish.I could go on and on and it would never be enough to explain exactly how good these games are. You just need to play them and see for yourself.The only thing bad about this game is the fact it ends."

I can now play all of the games in one of my favorite RPGs of all time, without having to jump through the hoops of getting DOS to run on a modern computer.  If you were a fan of the series, it is worth getting again.  Just getting to load it up and hear the music to Shadows of Darkness was nearly worth the sale price.  So far, all of them have loaded up just fine, and seem to have no problems.  If you are not familiar with the series, it is a point and click adventure, with rpg stats and combat.  The games follow the adventures of the PC as you go from hero wannabe to recognized hero.  This story is told through narrative and humor that have stood up well, and graphics that, while clearly aged, show the care with which they were crafted."

I bought the game to go through part 4 which was always notoriously buggy.. like, you can't even beat the game because of bugs.After buying this and installing it, steam installed DOSBOX and the game loads seamlessly from my Steam account. I've also noticed many of bugs seem to have disappeared. The game says its still version 1.0, but other than the occassional crash I haven't experienced any of the bugs that plagued the game back in the day.I'm very pleased to go down memory lane and pleasantly surprised at how well part 4 is running.I'd recommend downloading the QFG 2 remake as the original one is kinda hard on the eyes and aged pretty hard. The remake was made by fans with permission of Sierra and was pretty enjoyable even though the combat was a bit odd.Also, if you're like, 'where is my save file for quest for glory?' - the game will say that it saved your imported character to the c:\, but really its in the directory where your Quest For Glory game is. or just do a search for ""glory*.sav"" and then take that save file and put that in the root directory of the Quest for Glory game you're wanting to import it to.Example: I couldn't find qfg2.sav when trying to import him to part 3, so I had to get my save file and put it inC:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quest for Glory Collection\QG3before QFG3 would see it - even though it said it was looking in the c:\"
