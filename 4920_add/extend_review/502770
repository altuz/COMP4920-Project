,Recommended,502770,32287393,Posted: 9 June,all,RipWitch,"Did that bat take a beehive?!?Ready to tend to your lush farmland? Welcome to the swamp your hut sits on as it is ripe to grow plants to harvest. But, you don't exactly sell what you harvest. Armed with a few recipes, the various critter parts, fruits, leaves, and so on can be combined to make various voodoo items to sell.Armed with only a few plants, you work up your way up to getting more access to different plants and recipes with each level up. Three lanes are available to plant, the top for trees, middle for bushes, and the bottom for herbs. The beginning plants cost a decent amount but the more advanced ones will cost a lot, with the upgrades increasing the price. But these do contain ingredients for products that sell for  higher price than what you start out with. As you get more and more plants you can plant, you will eventually lose space in front of your hut so it will be time to expand. Of course the price will increase with every expansion, but more space equals more cash. I do recommend putting ghosts on the expansions, as you will need to scroll to the side at this point, but I do believe bats only bother plants on your current screen.Various animals will walk through your garden as they can also provide some ingredients. Of course, more variety will pass through as you level up as even lizards and dragonflies will eventually visit. But be careful of the bats! They will have no mercy to steal from yur garden! I believe the bats will link up to your spirits, as they will not take the mushrooms and bogroots until the spirits can. These will most likely be the ingredients you will be short of the most, including the beehives bees will leave behind. Luckily, there are ways to get more to spawn in forms of totems. Each totem having their own design to correspond to what they will attract when lit. Sadly these come way too apart. Snakes will be one of the earliest animals you need a lot of, but the totem for them don't become available till to 20s levels.An inventory is available, with limitations set. You have a set amount of each you can take in, with an upgrade increasing it, and once you try to harvest past it, those will be sold for one coin. Giving you a hint that you shouldn't buy anymore of those plants if you keep with having more than you can carry.But hey, you will not be the only one that can harvest. You can buy animals, starting with a rabbit before you unlock more by leveling up, that you can fatten up by feeding them their prefered food. But if this is going to take resources away from you, why do it? Permitting that you have available spots, you will get a prompt to sacrifice the animal once it is fully fattened up to turn them into a spirit. Forever slaved to your garden as they have to pick the various plants for you. This excludes the mushrooms and bogroots until you get the upgrade. If you place them by the plants they ate, they will also get a boost in growth speed. With the upgrades going to their plucking speeds.So later game brings you to only needing to scare off bats and picking animal parts once the spirits come in to help. What else can there be? It will occasionally rain, making spirits disappear and animals stop coming around. Even the totems will be put out due to the rain, nullifying their affects. Making you pluck everything yourself on a moment's notice to spice it up a bit. Before you know it, the rain will stop and everything will come back.Voodoo Garden leaves you to your own devices without a tutorial or what anything does. I do wish it gave some indication of the different aspects, especially when your plants (and those who will be planted there) can diminish in production. It only took a while that bees planted a beehive there and noticed that bees are your savior, where previously I kinda freaked out thinking it would forever block the space as there were no recipes calling for beehives at that time.Now this is not an idle game. While it does have idle aspects, Voodoo Garden is very much a clicker game and will only continue collecting and growing if it is running. With spirits helping out, you only need to click the bats and the animals walking by the plants, and even than there are recipes that do only require plant items.Overall+ Great visuals+ Music+ Simple- Can get old, as there is no motivations other than to continueFor a game that I bought just because I liked Viridi, it really grew on me. It really is a great game to just zone out for a while and look at their colorful visuals and hear the music. If you're an achievement hunter, they will be easy to get by just playing through once. I hope you make a prosperous garden."
,Not Recommended,502770,32425401,Posted: 14 June,all,Kazooie,"When I first got this game I really enjoyed it. It has good music, it's cute, and I liked having my own little garden and spirits to help around. After a few hours, I felt done with the game, but I couldn't really leave it with achievements unfinished. It took me 33 hours to finally get all of them. While this game has some good points, I don't find them good enough to really recommend this game to others.The good aspects are as I said, good music, cute game, as well as what I suppose is generally a decent concept. It's a good game for achievment hunters because if you're dedicated, you could finish them all in less time than what I took considering I wasn't paying attention 100% of the time. It helps that your spirits can help pick things like mushrooms up, so the 6666 mushrooms achievement isn't as intimidating as it seems. You can also play this game while not completely paying attention to it, allowing this game to be a good side thing if say you're doing something else or waiting for another thing to finish, you can just do some clicking around on this game in the meantime without worrying about saving progress or anything of the sort.The not so good parts of this game include all of the clicking (one of the achievements including clicking 2000 dragonflies). A chunk of the ingredients needed to make certain recipes in order to get coins requires you to click the creatures that run/fly/etc across your screen. The coins are of importance, as they allow you to buy more plants, expand your garden, etc. which all help you level up in the long run. I also found that this game became a little tedious after a few hours and I didn't really want to continue it. I sort of reluctantly did finish it (on the side of doing other things, as I don't believe this game is one that you could just sit and completely focus your attention on without getting bored) for the part of me that needed this game to be completed before given up on. Lastly, the biggest down side to this game is that I feel like it doesn't have that much replay value. Other games you can playthrough again for different experiences or to try different styles of play, etc. With this game though, I feel like once you play through it once, if you play through again it's just the same old thing.Honestly, I don't believe that this game is worth what it costs. I've played better games for much cheaper. I'm glad I got to experience it, but if I were given another opportunity to purchase a game like this for the price that it's at, I wouldn't do it again."

Crafting works on a priority basis, a priority that the player decides. Crafted items are worth significantly more than the produce itself. So in addition to growing the garden you can also strategize on how best to invest your income- plant upgrades, totems to encourage specific garden visitors that can contribute to your resource pool, more garden space (more plants), more storage space for your produce (so that it will eventually be crafted into something, rather than just sold cheap) or helper upgrades etc."
,Not Recommended,502770,24737737,"Posted: 6 August, 2016",all,Atarun,"DescriptionAt first glance, Voodoo Garden is a re-skin of Plantera, an idle game where you grow a garden indefinitely (or until you get all the achievements).However, in its curent state,Voodoo Garden is NOT an idle game. It is certainly a clicker, but since the game does not progress at all when it is shut down, I think it does not fit the definition of idle games. Indeed, all other idle games I know, except for some weird browser experiments, will welcome you back with a message saying how much you earned while you were away and this does not (and does not award you anything).Like Plantera, you own a garden with a variety of plant types and animals. The garden grows slowly before your eyes and you can either let your minions harvest slowly or speed them up by clicking.Unlike Plantera, you start with no minion (you have to feed animals then sacrifice them to get a spirit minion), there is no way to automatically defend your crops (at least at lower levels) and you will earn money not by selling your harvest directly but by using them in voodoo recipes.All in all, the one difference that will probably matter the most when comparing this game to Plantera is that prices never go down... In Plantera, whenever you buy something, its price rises, but when you sell it back, the price goes back down. This encourages experimentation: you can upgrade your plants and animals, knowing that you will be able to re-buy the lower level things later on. Here, the prices only go up, which makes the idea of selling anything kind of insane (except for getting the achievement). It seems the creator is considering removing this ""feature"" (imo, a bug) in a future update, but as it stands right now, Voodoo Garden will punish rather than reward experimentation. Which seems silly in a game where everything (recipes and spirit effects, not just the plants and animals) is revealed progressively, so you simply cannot plan in advance and MUST experiment, even though it is actively discouraged by the game design.ProsGorgeous 2D graphicsGreat diversity of mechanics and interactionsOriginal theme (and the cutest voodoo stuff ever)ConsBroken game design (prices should go down when you sell a plant or free a spirit, otherwise there is no point)No progress while awayNo stats of any kind (have fun counting everything)No way to tell how many slots there are for anything before trying to place one (so you don't know whether you're working up to buy something you could actually use or not, especially annoying with animalssince they take a good while before sacrifice and then you discover there is no available slot)When exactly does this game save??Minions are practically useless at lower levels, meaning the game is much more of a clickfest than Plantera or even Cookie Clicker and Clicker Heroes...VerdictVoodoo Garden has awesome graphics and a good concept but it is riddled with baffling game design issues... Those could be fixed rather easily.IMO, for this game to be worth anyone's time, the dev needs to do 7 things:Calculate prices based on currently owned items, not previously owned onesAward some money while away, based on current game state (like actual idle games)Buff up the minions and give you one at the start so that waiting will be an alternative to clicking like a maniac (as in actual idle games)Put stats in the gameSomehow highlight the difference between items you can buy but cannot place (because there are no available slots) and those you can buy and placeCreate a button to show all available slots or at least show the number of slots used / total number of slots for each category of itemCreate some way to automatically ward off bats (or make it accessible at lower levels, in case there is such a way I haven't unlocked yet)Until all 7 things are done, I cannot recommend this game, no matter how pretty it is (and it really is).Try Plantera instead."

Nothing ground-breaking, but it flows very nicely and is very aesthetically pleasing.- Pretty straight-forward. Nothing super-complicated.- Kinda fun.- Good sound quality and background music.- Interesting concept and idea.- Like some Facebook games without the annoying real-time harvests and constant begging for money.Cons:- No tutorial. Which would have been nice for a few things. There are a couple directions, but nothing explaining how things work in-depth.- Somewhat shallow.- Clicking. Oh god, the clicking.You have a garden. Every 10/15/20 seconds, whatever each particular plant is, they produce a fruit/flower/mushroom etc. You click to harvest. You harvest the right combo, you make a potion. Potion is sold. Use the money to buy more plants.Now, remember: Each plant has 2-5 fruits.You. Are. Constantly. Clicking. Grass, flowers, trees, animals, grass, flowers, trees, animals, ad nauseum. Click so you can buy more plants and click more so you can buy more plants and click more so you can buy more plants and click more so you can buy more plants and click more so you can buy more plants and click more so you can buy more plants and click more so you can buy more plants and click more so you can buy more plants...Do you see the problem? On and on and on.And there's no clear explanation on how the production priority works, so I think I'm utitlizing the most profitable prioritization, but who knows?It's a chill little game, but it doesn't take long to see exactly where this circle is going..."

I'm not sure what game they're playing: but this is definitly an idle game.I go afk, I come back, I spend my money, collect some special snail shells and dragonfly wings and leave. Refresh. Sure, there is no spirits to kill enemies, thus not getting me frog legs and such. But that's just an incentive to click a little bit: and don't all clickers make us click just a little?The only negative thing, is if you let it run all night and come back: the entire game will be laagy and requires a refresh. But that's just a small annoyance.Adorable! Worth the few coins it cost <3"
,Recommended,502770,30851628,Posted: 31 March,all,(💕) Pink Lily,"The game was worth the $$ and time investment. I recommend the game for casual gamers, 100% achievement hunters and people who are just looking for a fun clicker game. It was really difficult for me to drop so I played it nonstop until I completed it. I loved the music, graphics and how simple the game eventually becomes. You can leave the game idle and depending on the build would require some clicking and effort.You are building a Voodoo Garden and the items you need in order to craft items must be ""farmed"" Some of the required items are critters that you must click on like lizards that spawn. You can increase the rate by applying upgrades that become available as you level up.If you have played or heard of the game PLANTERA it is similar."
,Recommended,502770,24796460,"Posted: 9 August, 2016",all,Ananoriel,"An adorable clicker game where you have to care for your own swamp garden.The gameplay is pretty simple. You need to gather fruits, leaves, flowers and critters in order to make potions to sell. You can feed animals, sacrifice them if they are big enough, so they can help you as a spirit. So long you level up, you unlock more stuff to make potions. It worked out very relaxing for me, and it kept me busy for a while.I love the look of the game. The style of everything and the colour palette are super cute and comfy to look at. The soundtrack reminded me somehow of Age of Empires, with those drum sound effects. Perhaps I would have liked a more extensive tutorial at the beginning because not all things were clear to me. Besides that I don't have any negative points.I would recommend this game for people who like to play a simple relaxing game for not too much money.My rating for this game: 7/10."
,Recommended,502770,29105376,Posted: 7 January,all,Lady Dawn (NeedtoKnow Gaming),"Voodoo Garden is a stylized casual clicker game where you grow a garden, harvest plants and reagents from the critters who scuttle by, and make potions from them. It has a rather interesting take on the helper system and enough unlockable plants and upgrades to keep you occupied for a good while.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6XCrTrIjGk.Gameplay.*Click, click, click*Typical of the clicker genre, the majority of Voodoo Garden is played via clicking with your mouse. You can also use WASD or the directional keys to pan the camera, but you can use your mouse for that if you simply move it to the edge of the screen.You’ll gather ingredients yourself by clicking. If your inventory fills up, don’t worry! Every ingredient over your ingredient threshold adds one gold coin to your coffers. Ingredients can be gathered from most every creature that scurries through your garden—except for bats. These crafty little buggers will swoop down and fly away with ingredients unless you click them to shoo them away.Crocodiles and Skulls will occasionally float in the river along the bottom of the screen. There will be an audio cue—a watery sound—every time one surfaces and clicking on it will reward you with an amount of gold that increases every time you click a new one.You can access the plants available to you by pressing the coin icon in the top right corner. Select your greenery and plant it by clicking one of the green circles in your garden. There are three categories of plant: herb, shrub, and tree. Each can only be planted in their corresponding row (herbs in the front most row, shrubs in the middle, and trees in the furthest row).You can also purchase upgrades for your plants once their planted by clicking the window beneath the plant in the store. Each upgrade increases the rate at which the plant grows.The store also offers animals, totems, and upgrades for your utilities. I’ll break them down below.Animals: Each animal eats a specific plant that grows in your garden. Once it’s fat enough, you can sacrifice it to create a spirit that will help you harvest plants. They also cause the plants they ate while alive to flourish. Spirits can only be placed in specific spots between columns formed by herb, shrub, and tree and will only harvest from the columns closest to them.Like plants, these can be upgraded to work more efficiently.Totems: Totems attract specific critters to your garden in greater number. These are invaluable for the faster creatures like lizards, which will stop and stare at the totem, allowing you to click them and gather their tails.They can also be upgraded to increase their effectiveness.Utilities: These include upgrades to what your spirits can pick up and how many ingredients you can carry. They’re quite costly, but well worth the investment.Spirits will gather ingredients for you as long as it’s not raining. When it is raining, your spirits disappear and additional critters won’t dart about amongst your plants. Creatures that are already in your garden before the weather changes will remain. There’s a quiet ambiance when it rains, which is nice.Ingredients are used to produce potions, which are sold for gold and net you experience. You can set priority for what is created by assigning numbers to each recipe via the menu accessed by clicking your level in the top left corner. The little hut at the center of your garden will continue to churn out potions as long as you have enough ingredients.Your level increases once you have enough experience and increasing it gives you a greater variety of plants, animals, upgrades, and potion recipes..Atmosphere.The music in Voodoo Garden is serene and peaceful. It features a lot of wind instruments and a drum, which fit nicely into the theme. The music continues on an infinite loop, but it’s so charming that you don’t even notice.The graphics are bright and cutesy, stylized in such a way that they look hand-painted..Longevity.I've been achievement hunting, so I'm already 12 hours in. I forsee another couple of hours before I get all of them. For those who aren't as dedicated to getting achievements, longevity depends highly on your willingness to keep on clicking..Pros.Quick and easy to pick up.Appealing graphical style.Crafting potions adds a layer of strategic thinking when choosing plants.A peaceful, relaxing way to pass the time..Cons.Gameplay is too simple for lengthy play sessions.It’s too easy to click on something you don’t mean to. While collecting fruits and the like, I often found myself accidentally selecting one of my spirits or shifting a totem.The game does not continue on its own for a while after you leave like others in the genre do.No reason to play after you finish unlocking everything..Bottom Line.Voodoo Garden is an inexpensive and relaxing way to pass the time. If you’re a completionist, you’ll be able to collect the achievements simply by playing the game. If you enjoy casual clicker games like Plantera, you’ll be right at home here.Either way, the game will definitely be something you’ll turn to when you’re tired of slaying and struggling to survive in the other titles in your library.If this review helped you, please give it a thumbs-up.

76561198064106555,Recommended,502770,25050132,"Posted: 21 August, 2016",all,mrorange,"More a real clicker game than a classical idle game which can be finished in a decent amount of time - very addictive and highly recommended not only for fans of the genreMy first idle / clicker game was Adventure Capitalist; I loved the art style, the simple idea and the multiplication of numbers. I wanted to achieve 100 %, almost did, but then developers decided to implement more and more different maps, new achievements, etc. So I kind of stopped playing Adventure Capitalist, just randomly take a look once in a while. Other clickers followed, very addictive in the beginning, but mostly I stopped them before I got 100 % of the achievements.What does this all have to do with VOODOO GARDEN? Actually directly nothing, except the fact that VOODOO GARDEN gets the clicker genre right. You actually have to click in the game; you cannot just use some clicker fake programme and rely on the automatic idle mode. You need to be in the game to proceed further, that means you can't just start the game once in a while, like most idle games that count time offline. But of course you can easily play it in the background without losing anything (not like Fallout Shelter with its monster attacks).What is the game about?You are the owner of a swamp land. You plant bushes and trees in order to collect (click) fruits and vegetables, mushrooms and many more. With those ingredients the game automatically produces different forms of products (from poisonous potions to the Voodoo puppet). Production finished, you receive money you can spend on better and more vegetation. In the beginning you have to click on the vegetation yourself to collect the ingredients, then later you can buy animals (chicken to goats), which you feed until they are fat enough to be harvested. The spirits of the dead animals help you to collect the ingredients automatically, that means you don't have to click on them yourself (idle aspect of the game).The game is based on an experience points and level up system which allows you to unlock different vegetation or stronger animals on higher levels.Most potions or products require pieces of wild animals / insects in order to be created. Those automatically run into your garden. The spirits do not collect them automatically, which means you have to click on them yourself (real clicker).You cannot collect indefinite numbers of ingredients, at a certain point the counter stops and gives you a coin instead.The production line can be prioritized, which leads to a certain amount of tactical planning. Especially when it comes to the achievements which for example are “collect 2000 dragon flies”. The collection of the dragon is not counted if your stock is full, so you need to first produce something with dragon flies in order to empty your stock and before you click on the dragon fly.Besides of this simple but tactical mechanic you can build totems to attract a specific kind of animal / insect. You can level up every form of bushes, trees you plant or other products.Following what I liked and what I did not like, knowing that I highly recommend the game, even to people that have never played an idle or clicker game before.What I likedgame is addicting; you want to finish it which is possible in a decent waywell balanced play time; I needed 33 hours for the 33 achievements (100%)great dark atmosphere, with cute devilish art style and dark jungle soundsthere is a lot going on in your garden, it is fun to watch and fun to clickprioritization of products you produce – good tactical mechanismprogression system works good without going through values of coins no one ever heard of beforeexperience points and level up mechanic is motivatingthe fact that you actually have to click the animals / insects in order to collect them = no idle modus for animalsfair price (2.99 EUR)Steam cards and Steam achievements where 100 % achievements is possibleWhat I did not likethere are some performance problems; I had crashes from time to time and after a while the game starts stuttering; you need to start it again in order to refresheven that I liked the fact that I have to click on the insects; I expected at a higher level a spirit that helps collecting them for meproducts need to be more balanced when it comes to the ingredients; I had the impression that I was mostly producing the same stuff and needed therefore more of the same bushes and treesaccidentally clicking on the spirits or totems is annoying if you just want to collect ingredients in a fast way (you need to unclick with the right mouse button)Steam achievements need some sort of counter that you know how many you have to collect or some in game statisticsConclusionsA great reprensative of the clicker genre, which is simple and achievable. A game for the whole family. Warning! it is also addictive. Recommended!"

Game gets more interesting around level 15 onwards.It's not the best of clicker games, you can't collect anything while the game isn't launched for example - and you must manually click on animals to collect those items. It could do with a little tweeking in this area IMO, but it's one of the best games of this type i've played.An easy game to approach casually, relaxing to play.Worth the price forsome hours of distraction."

,Recommended,502770,29791103,Posted: 8 February,all,GiraffeMystic,"Its a clicker with a cute appearance, but without the usefulness that is idling (there is a way to idle but its not really an idle game). The game can only idle if you leave it running with enough spirits and plants going, but if the rainstorm happens then the spirits disapear until the storm ends. This means that you must frantically click everything, and I mean EVERYTHING just to still collect alchemy regents and earn gold.Pros:~Art and art style are cute~Fairly easy to understand even without a tutorial~More than just a clicker, has an alchemy gimick~Rainstorms boost plant growth rates and are frequent, but scare away spirit helpers.Cons:~Achievements must be obtained through painful grinding and waiting~The achievements don't even track properly or like most other games do on the achieve list.~Unlike Plantera, this game although looks like it should be a clicker-idle but is not. It is only a clicker.~Trying to idle is not worth it as you miss out on achievement related clickables (skulls and crocs)~Rainstorms boost plant growth rates and are frequent, but scare away spirit helpers.I feel like saying recomend, but I also feel as though the game is a tad bit decieving.  Its a small game that is fairly cheap in terms of pricing."

It just lacks the fun.I got many hours in, but I was more idle, than activly doing something.Pros:+ music is pretty chill+ artstyle is okCons:- very little and minor things to upgrade- first you need to buy animal ghosts to even being able to go idle, since only the ghosts farm stuff- the ghosts can never harvest the bugs and animals, only fruit and veggies- the only Voodoo themed element seems to be the products you are producing to get money and maybe the totems- it immensly lacks fun, it doesnt matter what you do basically- theres not much to unlock and once you have erything maxed out, there is no need to play it, for me that was after 20 hours, you may think thats very long, but since I left this on while I was gone, it took me less than a full day.....I was just looking for something that I can leave on, while Im at the store or cooking in the kitchen. At first it worked and was good, but it lost its fun factor so quick, since the game is so painfully restricted and short.

Many cannot be achieved by idling and require quite a bit of attentive clicking.Pros/Cons:+ Cute art+ Nice music/sound effects+ Upgrade system/unlockables+ Decent time killer+ It's cheap- There's not much in terms of a tutorial.  While there was some tool tips every so often, it would've been nice to have been given a little more info on what to do in the beginning.- Gold/XP can only be earned while the game is running.- Unlike many clickers, not every process can be automated.  The player must remain active to collect many of the game's ingredients.- Gets quite boring after awhile-- while new plants/upgrades are gradually added, none of them really add anything interesting.Overall:It's hard to say quite how I feel about Voodoo Garden.  While I was charmed by its aesthetics, the whole experience was ultimately lackluster.  To me, the best part of a clicker(especially a more creative clicker like this) is getting more and more efficient to the point where all processes are automatic except for overall management.  I found Voodoo Garden disappointing in the fact that the user's job never really gets much easier.  From the beginning to the end, the player is madly clicking the screen to collect ingredients that their helpers cannot collect.  It gets to be a tedious process.Ultimately, unless you're a huge fan of mindless clickers, I'd pass this game up."

That is, until you begin filling the swamp with plants, herbs, trees, spirits, and more, to create an ecosystem that contends with pests who are out to steal your harvest.The mechanics are simple to learn after playing for several minutes. The game caters to both the casual and more ""hardcore"" gamer, by this I mean you can either leave the game open in a window while playing a separate game and still gain some passive income, or you can get the full experience by combining the passive harvesting abilities of the spirits (they help you collect fruit, leaves, herbs, etc) with an active excercise of intensive clicking. There are even tricks one may learn to harvest more quickly and efficiently, but I will not spoil that for you here.

Well, it's a great game and it's actually pretty fun. Now, it's missing a 1 because it can be a little annoying. I left it on for about 4-5 hours while I went somewhere. Now, by that time I had the 7th potion and was level 12-13. Only problem is I could only have two made because of two things. The spirits can't pluck grass or get animals. Now, I would love if the ability that lets spirits pick mushrooms let them pluck grass, and if there was an ability that let them get animals. Or even if just the pig spirit could pluck grass and mushrooms. Next to that, as I've said many times, overall a great game with a nice little voodoo twist that I got for under a dollar during the Summer Sale.See you all, in other reviews, because I do those suddenly for some reason."

HACKERS ARE EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!! i try to farm flower, grass and tree but hacker come take my crops and i cant progress so i must restart but this game is good because it has very good graphics and it is chill to play and talk with friends while playing and this is good because of that even if there is cheater in this game on every corner and front of the game.....I will keep on playing but i recommend you to fix the hacker ifnestation to attract more players to your game, if hacker is out, more people in. It is easy 1+1 maths so today i learned that this game has good graphic and crops and management, but ahcker destroy this game when i am a simple farmer to get money for upgrades and maybe i can afford the cat on roof.And now to the PVP part of the game.this game has a pvp part where you fend of other hackers trying to attack your farm and crops byt steal and thief the crops you farm and now i tell you one thing: i owned one hacker and he dropped the crop back to me and i could use that crop to progress further. Pvp is fine but still there is hacker problem here as well.Summary is that this game is strong in graphics, crops, farm, money, management and of course you can boss and kill and feed animals till they die buy the food you feed them from crops and you sue the spirit to do slave labour for you. It may be a suble racist thing in here, but i will not talk much about that. SO overall i recommend this game if you like graphics and management, but i need to say this one mroe time: this game has a BIG, and i wrote BIG with capital letters because itis very BIG problem with hackers. If hackers will get vacbanned like in csgo, this game is perfect and perhaps even the bst gmae on my list.Before i close this review totally, i jsut need to add that i sold my AK-FIRE SERPENT in order to afford it.

,Recommended,502770,25026105,"Posted: 19 August, 2016",all,Lizzylar,"I had spent a lot of time on Plantera and was looking for another really cute clicker. Compared to Plantera... Voodoo Garden is a lot less relaxing and takes a bit more strategy since you're trying to grow ingredients for potions to make money. Also, you have to do some fast clicking to keep those bats from stealing from your garden. I have found the controls somewhat annoying. Scrolling horizontally is a pain once your garden becomes large enough and sometimes you'll accidentally pick up things you don't want to while you're clicking (Which seems like a huge oversite for a CLICKER game, they should patch it so you have to enable some sort of mode if you want to move/delete things in your garden.)All in all. It has a really cute style and I would reccommend it to fans of the genre."

You don't have to click all around if you're tired or just lazy, feed and sacrifice those animals, their spirits will collect stuff for you. Want to progress faster, start clicking. For the price, I don't think you'll cry even if this game is not what you expected."

Lots of personality and the graphics/sound create a cohesive and immersive environment. I would love to see an even slower-paced ""zen mode"" as the game does ramp up a bit after awhile, but AFAICT there's no real way to ""lose"" and you can just make peace with the bats eating some of the fruits in your garden (the only antagonist)."

(Typical cat. Go swat the bats, will ya? Freeloader!)-The purchasing of things seems to be held back, not just by money but by level as well.-There is no ""walk away and let it do it's thing, reap the rewards later"" (a la Plantera). Really would like to see that put in.Other;-Needs a way to stop making certain items/ be able to set priority 0 so it wont make those things.Overall, I like it. It just needs a tweak here and there, that's all."

You just harvest your stuff, feed your chicken, click on the baddies and make them go away, and chill. There's absolutely no stress. I like the concept of having a little voodoo garden, but I wish there were more complex mechanics that went into the game sometimes, like maybe you mix the potions yourself? It's good for a little stress relief but it gets kind of boring after a while. I like the colorful graphics and your little voodoo chicken friend, though."

,Recommended,502770,29972169,Posted: 16 February,all,Zushakon,"Voodoo Garden ReviewWho should spend time playing this?If you enjoy clicker style games.If you’re looking for something to play in the background of a movie or show.How much Money Should I spend?$2 or LessWhat’s it about?A simple game about building up a garden via expansions and upgrades.The end goal, though the game doesn’t necessarily have one, would involve maximizing the size of the garden and quality of your plants and spirits.What is the Gameplay?The goal is to click on objects as they grow within your garden which gathers materials you will automatically use to make potions.The potions generate money for you to upgrade the garden to access additional trees, shrubs, and herb.You can eventually automate gathering with the help of “Spirits”.Unlike most clicker games, clicking on objects in this game is not only beneficial but in some particular cases required.Graphics/VisualsBright and Colorful ArtworkThe animations are average.A great vibrant art style that gives the garden a varied tone and is aesthetically pleasing.Sound/MusicSound effects are very basicThe music is decent, nothing spectacular.Overall, nothing stellar here to talk about, sound wise everything is just OK.What does it compare to?Adventure CapitalistClicker HeroesSoda DungeonAchievementsMost of the achievements are reasonable and can be earned through a single play though.One specifically requires you to restart your game, which isn’t an issue since you’ll do this one last.The “Skull” Achievement can be rather time consuming if you weren’t actively playing i.e. letting the game run automatically similar to a clicker game.What are my overall thoughts?I bought this game to play alongside several other clicker games.It does require you to be more engaged then most other games of this variety though you can still reach the point where you “Set it and forget it”.It’s bright and colorful and the theme is very relaxing and soothing to the eyes.I didn’t play with the music or SFX on but the amount I did hear sounded decent.I would only pay a few bucks for the game and only if you’ve played one of the FtP Clicker games and know you enjoy them."
