,Recommended,502800,32367827,Posted: 12 June,all,Tomahawk Dunk,"WARNING: This game is surprisingly fun, play at your own risk.Senran Kagura Estival Versus (EV) follows in the footsteps of its predecessor Shinovi Versus (SV) in subverting the anime tiddy game trope. Exactly like SV, EV looks like a shallow fanservice game at first glance but if you manage to look past the surface of EV, the game is so much more than that.EV is a sort of a weird amalgamation of gameplay, blending elements of fighting games together with elements of musou games to create its own unique style. On top of that it is a much more extensive game compared to SV and in general succeeds in providing everything a good sequel should. It looks better, it plays better, it has a bigger story, a bigger character roster, more enemy variety and even more extensive customization options.Yes, you can play waifu dress-up with even more meticulous detail this time around!Overall, Estival Versus is a shining example of how to get a sequel right. While SV can be finished in a day or two of dedicated play, expect to put much more time into EV. I'm sitting at a 100 hours and I've only just beat the main story and the Shinobi Girl's Heart stories. I have yet to max level all my favourite characters or A-rank most missions on the hard difficulty... Though admittedly, a fair few of these 100 hours have been spent in the dressing room posing characters for dioramas. (It's an addiction, please send help)."

If not then just get this one.Then again, it's up to you.- ""I have SV, should I get this one?""Well, why not?

What about the other DLCs? well, it's kinda obvious.Costume DLCs if you like to customize the character's outfit.Mission DLCs if you're looking for more challenges.BGM DLC if you're a BGM lover or just simply like the BGM from SV.- ""I'm new to the series, is this game for me?""Do you like Hack&Slash?

The game has KEYBINDINGS CUSTOMIZATION so no worries.When you started/run the game however, the keybindings doesn't seem to work (yes, a bug).In order to get it to work -> pause the game -> go to the settings -> you'll see that your keybindings are 'saved' -> you just need to re-assign the keybind the same as the one you've saved before (just one is enough) -> save settings -> resume the game -> enjoy.Dunno about the mouse since I play the game with keyboard only. The 'bug' probably affects custom mouse control too.They've fixed the bug!And. . .that's it.Hope it helps.Extra :- ""The characters on this game are all underage girls! This game is for pedophiles!""Hmm, Sure they're young but they're no-Wait, could it be- You don't like young girls, so that means you're into older women?!Good for you! there's a playable 81 years old grandma in this game! :)Hahaha found you a treasure eh?-""Ew I'm not into ugly grandmas!""Hey now, you sir are being rude.Respect your elders.- ""This ****** weeb game shouldn't exist""Well, too bad it exist.

,Recommended,502800,30739330,Posted: 25 March,all,Akka,"Girls, Girls, Girls!Senran Kagura Estival Versus is a musou game starring dozens of top-heavy young ninja ladies. Punch everyone until their clothes fall off, but don't get stripped naked yourself!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=891400333GameplayCombat is simple to input and repetitive. You use the same x, x, x, y combo for every string of attacks and other than holding y to charge your alternate attack the characters all play similar to one another.Nearly every level has you facing down hundreds of rank and file mooks, typically capped off by one of the characters. The strategy is always the same. Enter frenzy mode to buff your damage while crippling your defense. One decently placed special attack (ninja art) will level you up, refilling both your hp and special bar. You can clear out entire levels by baiting hoards of enemies into the radius of your next special attack.Levels will typically contain destructible platforms for you to find and crush. These can annoyingly be planted behind arbitrary invisible walls. Side missions are locked until you can destroy a specific number of platforms (a different number for each character) but if you're only interested in the main storyline then you can safely ignore them.The dressing room gives you an overwhelming variety of outfits and options for you to customize the characters. Each outfit and hairstyle has five alternate colors (up from two in the prequels). You can even place and pose up to five of your favorite ladies in a diorama! Here's a little something I made.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=888708930VisualThe game runs at 60fps even at 4k. It's well optimized enough to run decently on cards as weak as a gtx 450, while including those luscious options for higher resolutions with more current gpus. This is no cheap vita port--even small textures are rendered with astoningly high resolution. This port was optimized above and beyond my expectations, outclassing the previous SK game on steam by miles.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=888580892SoundA handful of decent songs, with the option to use music tracks from the previous game. The scenes in between missions are fully voiced in Japanese.PlotThe game introduces several plot arches that go completely unresolved, likely saved for the sequel. Having assumed you played the previous game, there's almost no effort to explain the events from the earlier titles.A couple heartfelt moments might resonate with you towards the end. Themes of tragedy and loss can be weakened when the characters are offering their farewells to loved ones while half naked.After you finish the main storyline, the game frees you to play side missions. Each character has five and you're encouraged to play with your favorite characters.SpectacleFanservice is the name of the game. This game is as sexually gratifying as Mortal Kombat is violent. There's even 50+ finishers that you can trigger by crushing an enemy in a specific part of the level! Knock someone into the hot dog stand and you'll bathe her in tubes of meat!Clothing is worn down and torn in progressively more revealing spots. Nearly everyone can transform, giving themselves a brand new outfit for you to tear up!DifficultyYou can safely cheese the game by abusing the frenzy mode. This won't work in versus against real people, but it's a convenient tactic for safely clearing out the hundreds of copy paste goons cluttering you. Missions always default to the easy difficulty, and personally I don't see any reason to make it harder on yourself here. This is one of the few games I enjoy for the spectacle over the satisfying gameplay so feel free to take it easy here and relax as the game segues into more delicious, lucious fanservice.Four out of Five StarsIf there's one game that can satisfy your libido for cute anime ladies then it's right here. There are vivid weaknesses stemming from the repeititve gameplay and the serious, often somber tone of the plot often clashes against the half naked women. Despite these shortcomings, I adore this series for its magnificently crafted fanservice that permeates every fiber of this game."

For many reasons..."
,Recommended,502800,31336478,Posted: 24 April,all,Trash Tier Player,"Senran Kagura Estival Versus is a hack and slash game, which is the sequel of Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus. Basically in this game, you use a character and beat your way among tons and tons of nameless mooks until you met your objectives, be it defeat a boss character, complete within a certain period of time, or just beat up everything on the screen. As you beat mobs up, when they take enough damage their clothes will tear apart, inflicting more damage will cause most of it to tear off, unless you use a finisher move, which if they are in their undies, it will completely be torn apart, leaving them naked. Hence the term used in Doom, rip and tear.Combat in this game is similar to Shinovi Versus, where there are light and heavy attacks, Breach Arts, Burst, Aerial Raves and Ninja Arts or Ninpos. Each character have their own set of chain combos and Ninpo. As in Shinovi Versus, your character have 3 forms; default form, transformed form or Shinobi Transformation and Frantic form. Depending on how long you stay in whichever form, whenever you finish the mission or not, it will fill up a meter based on that form you stayed in, which is Flash for default outfit, Yang for Shinobi Transformation and Yin for Frantic.While in Shinovi Versus, the storyline for each schools is quite jumbled up, in Estival Versus, the storyline for all schools is the same. Regardless of faction, they just have a single story line in this game. Each character have their own story lines as well, which are only unlocked after you destroyed a certain number of towers scattered in certain missions. The mobs here, are pretty much similar to the ones in Shinovi Versus, with the addition of some new mobs with different traits, like the monkey mob, ram mob and crane mob.Combat-wise, in addition to the basic attacks, Aerial Raves, burst and Breach Arts, there are few more moves being added in this game. Wake up attacks basically gives you and option for those people who loves rushing you down even when you are down, whether its an attack or a backstep dodge. Another new thing added is wall run, where you can jump and run on the walls and it allows the wall ambush attack, where when running on the wall, you can press any attack button and they will launch themselves onto the enemies, resulting in a free Aerial Rave if it connects. Ultimate Ninja Arts, which costs 5 scrolls, are no longer limited to being used at 20% HP, now it can be used whenever you have 5 scrolls available and after level 11 onwards.In Shinovi Versus, the game is really fast paced, so everything feels very fast. In Estival Versus, they rebalanced things, such as the consecutive guard have a significant delay now, about 2 seconds. You cannot spam guard anymore, praying for a parry. Also dash cancelling is nerfed in a way that you cannot dash cancel out of many moves now, only certain moves. You can still jump cancel out of them though. Mobs now attack slightly more than usual, even on easy difficulty, so if you play only on offense, you will take a lot of damage. In short, this game encourages slightly more defensive plays, instead of going balls deep all the way. With the slow down in pace, character speed in chaining moves are also changed as well.I have to say, firstly, the graphics in this game is way better than Shinovi Versus. Other than that customization in this game is way more advanced than that in Shinovi Versus. Want a different colour hair for Hikage? Want to use transformed outfit as the default one? Want to use a hat only for Shinovi Transformation? Sure thing, you can do any of those. You have way more flexibility here than in Shinovi Versus in terms of pimping out your character. In fact, they even added a diorama mode for people who just like to pose their character. You can put up to 5 characters in a background, doing whatever poses that you want! If you think Shinovi Versus had a big roster of 22 characters, then this game have an insane roster number of 30 characters! There are additional 5 characters that are DLC only, but they don't add anything to the story. However, you get to used characters that you loved in Ikki Tousen and Dead or Alive here!Fan service, oh boy this game have plenty. Firstly mobs also now experiences clothing damage when they are heavily damaged, thus you can see mobs wear their undies when they take heavy damage. Also with enough clothing damage done, if you finish the boss of with a Ninpo, their clothes will tear completely. Previously in Shinovi Versus, full nudity can only be achieved if an Ultimate Ninja Art is used on a lingerie clad boss only. Certain maps also add features know as Climax Finish, where if you beat the boss characters at designated locations, all of their clothings will tear completely, and they will interact with the environment in an embarassing manner. Yay for more fanservice!Despite all this nice things, alas there are few things to gripe on. The main thing I really feels need addressing is the AI and the amount of perks it gets. Sure the AI here is not good (from running into a wall or running all the way into an AOE Ninpo), however the among of perks it gets are insane! In addition to the hyper armor in their transformed mode for all moves, firstly they spam waaaaaaaaaaaaay too much I-frame moves. If you have a character whose chain combos knock them down slightly, prepare to see them retaliate with a wake up attack which waste time or launches you instead. They will do this EVERY SINGLE TIME they are knocked down. Also, they can transform while in a juggle state (Why? Isn't a transformation + Burst effect on the ground enough?) and start with a lot of scrolls available, so they tend to spam tons and tons of Ninpos (Why?!), which is an extreme time waster. In short, boss battles in this game is practically the same as in Shinovi Versus: Ninpo spamming the bosses to oblivion before they transform.At lower levels, mobs may be quite docile, however at higher difficulty, they become more spammy with their attacks. The Turtle mobs here is another special mention, like in Shinovi Versus. Not only they guard so much at higher difficulties, however, their wake up attack makes them INVINCIBLE on wake up. WHY?! This mob is already one of the most frustrating mobs for charaters with crappy Breach Arts or Ninpos, but making them being not able to defeated fast really cranks the annoyance to another level. And they run away all the damn time! Did I mentioned pretty much many maps hare are quite open spaced? Good luck chasing them. And parries, oh my god, what have they done? Why does boss character able to escape from MY parries?! Why does parry makes you take damage when another attack squeeze into it?! Parry is supposed to be rewarding, why am I being punished for it? It's not easy especially with the anti-guard spam in service.In spite of the massive customization, you can't really change the colour of the undies. Also character stories are locked until you cleared a certain number of towers, as mentioned, then again, the character stories may contain spoilers. It's kinda annoying to go into a 3 on 1 map with a character that you have barely any idea on using though, until you are forced to do so. I didn't played the PvP portion of the game, but from what I heard, even with the rebalancing attempts, its still not balanced. Daidonji here is still top tier, Yagyu, Asuka and Mirai spamming still exists and runaways still are there.Overall, I am satisfied with this game. Sure I am more used to the faster paced Shinovi Versus, as I spent many hours levelling everyone there, but this is still a fun game. I would recommend getting it, though coming from Shinovi Versus, it would take time to get used to it. Again, don't play it when your family members are around you pervert. Get it while its on sale as well if possible.A 6.2/10 from me."

,Recommended,502800,34470009,Posted: 24 August,all,Nathan,"TL;DR:Senran Kagura is a series that is beloved by fans for good reason. The gameplay has always been enjoyable; the story entertaining, and the Waifu meter is off the charts. Estival Versus is no exception.Estival Versus is by far the best looking Senran Kagura game to date. The gameplay is very smooth and refined too. As far as the story; it's not the best in the series; but it's by no means bad. There are over 20 of playable characters and several DLC additions The game is focused less around building on the central story of the franchise in this game and more on character progression. I'd reccomend watching the Anime and the OVA to get a sense of the backstory to the game.If you haven't played a Senran Kagura game before; it's a beat-em up style game with a hearty helping of anime girls. I'd reccomend a controller for any of the games in this series.Pros:~ Plenty of 'Plot' with some story on the side~ Well over 20 Playable characters~ Gameplay is very well done; very smooth~ Looks amazing; graphics are top notch~ Dank 'Uncensor' mods exist for those looking for a bitmoreCons:~ The game doesn't explain the backstory at all; so new players may gonna be confused~ Story starts off a little slow~ The plot twist is visable a from space to long time fans; but it is welcome none the less~ The DLC is pricy; but still worth getting."

Ever.If you arent though and can tell the difference between porn and a video game, Grab this title as i did for a game with substantial content and half decent combat. It runs at a perfect 60fps at 1080i on my underwhelming gaming laptop so other proper setups will not have an issue. I cannot comment on 4k compatibility as I dont have a monitor that supports said range.The game is Japanese with english subtitles which is great because in all honesty english voice actors just arent the same. So beware if you hate reading and the soundtrack is absolutely perfect.I also grabbed the DLC because holy crap i like this kind of thing and dont want the world to get censored. . Long short - Get it."

,Recommended,502800,33613918,Posted: 17 July,all,LightsJusticeZ,"Bought this game for the boobs - and the mods to show them boobs. After the initial thrill wore off, the game definitely is still fun and kept playing it all the way through.Story 7/10: Compared to the more serious tone of SHINOVI VERSUS, the story in this game is a bit more laid back and more fun, though it can get serious when it needs to, so it's all just laughs and a good time.Gameplay 8/10: While each character is pretty much Mash/Hold Attack + Launcher + Aerial Attacks + Specials; they have their own unique feel to them which gives a health variety. They all have 3 unique specials that also feel different between the shinobis. Most of the missions involve fighting mass waves of enemies then fighting characters 1v1, 1v2, and 1v3. Using their specials against mass waves of enemies just has a statisfying feel. Think of it like Dynasty Warriors.Sound/Music 8/10: It's all in Japanese with English subs, but even then, it's translated well and the dialogue will definitely have you laughing and but also remind you that there is a serious story overall. The music is catchy, probably what you'd expect from most Anime. Nothing sounds awful or terrible - loved it all. And compared to the first game, it's a big improvement with the music!Graphics 9/10: While most of the budget probably went to boob physics, the game's overall look is crisp and clean. Going from the previous game to this game, you can see a huge improvement in just about everything: models, textures, animations, camera...it's all been improved in every area and really brings it all together. The best is during combat, that's where all the animations shine the most. But in the story mode, when telling scenes between battles, it looks a bit bland with each character using a few poses that are reused over and over. The weird thing is, they also did this in the previous game, but even that was improved in this game.Overall 7/10 - It's a pretty average game with an average story and average combat. The biggest selling point is obviously the fan service, but once you get past that, it just shows the game is average. It's shown ALOT of improvement from SHINOVI VERSUS and this series could definitely blossom to become more than just a fan service game, as it is apparently becoming more popular with more spin-offs coming soon."

,Recommended,502800,33771263,Posted: 24 July,all,Clockwork Ultimate Peon,"After playing Shinovi Versus, I was excited to see this finally coming to Steam. Not only is it a sequel to Shinovi Versus, but it greatly improves upon the original game in almost every way. Improved graphics, More characters, more customization, more missions, a more cohesive story, improved characters, updated features, brand new features, and more! As I big fan of Shinovi Versus, Estival Versus does not disappoint at all, and actually blows away many of my expectations. While not perfect, like the original, it greatly improves upon the formula and makes it an even more enjoyable experience.Pros-Many characters. Before DLC, there's well over 25+ different characters, and the DLC characters are well worth it, especially Ayame, Naraku, and Kagura.-Greatly improved combat. Combat is far less repetitive than in Shinovi Versus, with improved combos and combat flow, ""bombshells"", stronger character growth, and more.-Even better customization. Multiple color options for clothing and accessories, expanded options (such as making accessories form specific), more accessory slots, being able to use both normal outfits and shinobi outfits universally, etc. There is also a diorama feature if you want to take humorous screenshots of characters.-New visuals and features, such as ""creative finishers"", more dynamic cutscenes, and better animations overall.-Larger, more interesting maps. They are much larger, and have more paths available.-Even more to unlock. Expanded Library offers new visuals, such as the creative finishers and character-specific animations. Shinobi Heart missions return, and there are now additional side missions to complete!-More missions. 50+ Story missions, and over 120 Shinobi Heart Missions (all of which are available to all characters after completion). There are additional DLC missions as well.Cons-While starting fairly weak already in Shinovi Versus, Characters start out even weaker in Estival Versus, and levelling is overall slower (although much more gradual) than before. You can also level mid-mission, and make use of unlocked combos and abilities in the moment, so this is not too bad.-Bosses are significantly tankier, especially in later missions. This means some missions may drag on.-Some characters (no spoilers) only have a Shinobi form, meaning they have no access to Yin or Flash, limiting how far you can really level them. This also means they lack the full-heal transforming provides.Misc-Similar to Shinovi Versus, it still requires several menus to switch characters for customization.-Lingerie Lottery is back with more lingerie....but the animation is now slower.-While there is far more DLC than with Shinovi Versus, none of it is truly necessary. The game is perfectly fine with none, and the only ones I would say are necessary are Character DLC's. Naraku, Kagura, Ayame, Ikki Tosen, and Dead or Alive Ayane.-Shopkeeper Girl is a (DLC) Playable Character!Overall, a very strong step-up from Shinovi Versus, fixing many of the flaws and providing much more interesting content that further improves on the formula, and that means more interesting combat and fan service both! While Shinovi Versus is a fantastic introduction to the characters, Estival Versus is definitely the superior version.9/10"

,Recommended,502800,30698088,Posted: 23 March,all,Blue Klaw,"It's fine for what it is. Not amazing, but fine. While reminiscent of Musou games like Dynasty Warriors, it's missing a lot of features those games have - features that hurt this game for their exclusion. For example: Special attacks have a long startup but do not freeze your opponents in place in front of you before activation (as in Musou titles). This makes many special moves impractical and hard to land. Their long startup makes them impossible to use straight out of a combo unless you've stunned your opponent. Some characters, like Hanabi, are a chore to play because they don't have any level of super armor when they attack. This hurts Hanabi harder than anybody else, and not just in that it makes her impossible to play online. Higher level mooks that attack you will stagger you: This kills most of the fun I had playing Hanabi. The roll that you can use out of knockdown isn't particularly effective, either. Against certain characters like Ryoubi or when fighting more than one character at a time, you may find yourself struggling to stand back up. The AI isn't all that smart or fun to play against either. Long special attack animations tied with the fact that characters are completely invincible while using special attacks (even ones that miss) means you'll be doing quite a bit of waiting around for your next chance to deal damage.What this gamereallyis is a waifu dress-up simulator. You like buxom women? You'll get a lot out of this game. You like jiggle physics? You'llreallyget a lot out of this game. You looking for solid combat? Look somewhere else. While it's great that the on-screen enemy count has improved since Shinovi Versus, dealing with special mooks as some playable characters is a bore in some cases and a chore in most others. There's one special mook in particular that you can only attack after a parry or with special attacks. This slows down combat, and I don't think that's good for a Hack-n'-Slash title like SKEV.I don't know exactly why, but I remember enjoying my time with Shinovi Versus on Vita a lot more. Maybe it's just because I played it nearly 4 years ago and don't remember much. Estival Versus definitely upgrades the fanservice, graphics, and the enemy count. All great plusses. What it fails to do it make combat any more interesting or less frustrating than it was in Shinovi Versus. I'd still recommend this game, but there's a lot about it that I simply do not like."

It came out on PC! 10/10 Senran Kagura Estival offers a ton more content than it's predecesor Shinovi Versus. Very much more tactical then Shinovi as well. No more endless dash cancels and using what you have to overcome obstacles.  I really recommend it to anyone who loves Dynasty Warriors type games. With Fanservice. Yes. Pantsu, Nudity and Yes, Breasts!  If you can get past all the fanservice, this game is really well done. Try out Multiplayer, It has changed since SV.  More multiplayer options to play with your friends and see who comes out on top.  The only thing up to this point is the PS4 Version had  true 1 v 1 matches in online play. It hasn't been released on PC yet, However, they should fix that fairly soon.  Anyone who picks this game up, I look forward to PvP with you.  Long Live Senran Kagura!"

I recommend getting SKSV first if you care about story, but if you only care about gameplay, SKEV is better.for comparison with SKSV, combats feels more fluid and balanced, no one feel overpowered (except for some DLC char). now support up to 10 person multiplayer (haven't checked how smooth). it also feels optimized with constant 60 fps for my PC. you better have controller to play this game though, seriously, get one for action game like this.Story is begin after the events of the special OVA (watch it on youtube or somewhere, recommended, but not required as it's only mentioned on prologue of the story). the girls is now summoned to attend special shinobi ceremony. yes, that's the plot, story progress might be a bit weaker now, but instead we got alot more in depth info of each characters in senran kagura.Pros :+ Good Quick hack and slash action+ alot of girls to choose from+ Bouncy Fanservice+ Other features like Photo mode for more ""intimate"" time to your favorit characters+ ""Creative"" Finish+ Multiplayer up to 10 person+ Ryofu (for me)Cons :- Story is a bit weaker than SKSV- can quickly get repetitive, as there only a little variation in single player modeto Summarize :- You like hack and slash and anime graphic? : get it- You like hack and slash with good story? : consider other title first, try SKSV- You like bouncy anime boobs? : ♥♥♥♥ING GET IT!- You like Ikkitousen : JUST GET IT! not like that many game you can play as one of Ikkitousen characters."

As combat is more slower and technical compared to the faster pace of the previous title.I haven't actually finished the story yet, so I'll comment on that another time, but expect the same kind of story you'd get from Shinovi Versus (probably), except this time it revolves around a Festival.And as it seems, the developers are working as much as possible to iron out the bugs of the release since there are still a few as of this post date (3/28/2017).So if you liked Senran Kagura, should probably also grab it for PC."

So im not necessarily calling this came good because of my friends or reviewers comments, im calling it good because aside the over use of boobs on this game it is an actual good game.

Yet the makers have put an incredible ammount of effort into exactly those areas. All of the clevages on the screen have very fun and endearing things to say and some stories can be surprisingly emotional. Be it one holding her pain in just long enough for her mother to die in peace, another realizing that joy in the now is fleeting nd can't last forever or another finally accepting that groping women's boobs is only  statisfying for so long and that there are also butts, legs and bellies to grope (haven't we all been there?)Personally, I can't wait for someone to make a tool to lower the jiggling a bit and maybe adjust the bust sizes to make the characters more distinct as with the last entry.Still, this is a shamefully fun game with a lot of humor, quirk and fanservice."

I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the waifus would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging waifu coming over and taking a sh¡t on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some hentai on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some takoyaki. My waifus preferred octopus takoyaki but healthier waifus might have a taste for green onion or maybe even pickled ginger. Fat, unhealthy waifus are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your minister mori out and scatter takoyaki out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cµm. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the waifus to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to desu gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cµm on your waifu. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of mastµrbation is very frightening to the waifus, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cµmming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the waifu and catch her right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those waifus reel around covered in cµm and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven't done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a crowd of waifus, neckbeard itching and waiting for them to come close to me.TL;DR Buy this game if you get turned on by censored cartoon boobs"

It is in no way worth the price tag.It's a fun little brawler with some fun characters, mired in sloppy design choices.  Pointless barriers constantly get in your way even though you can and must walk right around them.  You're constantly in a situation of not being able to just walk down an open street, but instead having to scour the perimeter for the one rooftop the devs decided you could leap over to access the other side of the street.The AI just outright does not appear to have pathing at all; AI opponents attempt to move in a straight line toward wherever the player is, and jump if they encounter obstacles.  This means they constantly get  hung up on the aforementioned pointless barriers.  How do you make a game with so many obstacles and not give the AI any kind of pathing ability? It's pathetic.The single player mode is one of those ones that force you to play a little bit of every character, which means you will constantly find yourself playing characters you don't like or who have aggravating playstyles.  The online multiplayer is not very active, so you won't get a lot of play out of it unless you have a friend to play with.It's fun, but it's not worth the full price.  And frankly, it is insultingly sloppy in its design."

,Recommended,502800,34727207,Posted: 3 September,all,MicFrequency,"Who would've thought that a combination of a high quality hack n slash and big breasted anime girls would compliment eachother so much? I certainly didn't and went in skeptical and ended up having quite a bit of fun. While the story is shakey and pretty much 80% sex and boobs and 20% actual plot, if you really just don't care about that, there is fun to be had with this game. Now this is actually one of the best hack n slashes I have played since Devil May Cry when it comes to the fighting mechanics, combos, and the fluid controls. BTW I play with a Steam controller so I have no idea how the game plays out on a keyboard and mouse but with the contoller, I was pulling off hard hitting moves with a breeze.The game looks fantastic as well with its colorful enviroments, smooth anime character design, and 60fps capable animations. Speaking of characters, you have 25+ playable characters all with unique fighting styles and weapons. Also you can customize all those characters with many different outfits and accesories that you can unlock by completing the missions.So my final thought is this is a solid game with cute anime girls that beat eachother senseless until their clothes are ripped off from their bodies. That's what it's all about and if you are going in wanting exactly that, this game is perfect for you. I rate it 8/10 and would reccomend it to fans of anime/manga and fast pasted fighting games."

There is a gratuitous amount of boooby shots and panties (theres quite a few outfits were their panties are revealed when they run) but I would generally describe it as being more cute and lewd than erotic.It's attention grabbing feature is the shamelessness, but it's actually a fun game on top of that, and it's not porno either. It's something that you'll actually want to play. It's like Dynasty Warriors with anime girls, except it's a lot better than the Dynasty Warriors game I played (the gundam one).  Theres a lot of different characters and they do vary in attack styles, and it can take a few missions to find a girl that you like. The first one especially is initially painful to play as.  You unlock more attack combos and level stats for a character as you use them.  If you want a simple beat 'em up with busty ladies, this is your game. And yes, there is an uncensor mod in the community guides.Pros:A lot of different characters to use.Reasonbly high amount of content. 57 ""main"" missions plus special missions for each girl, and another set of missions.Character customization through clothing customization, you can dress them in whatever way you think is cutest.Beautiful boobiesWorld class physics systemAsuka best waifuI will never be flaccid again.Cons:Lot of missions but they are very short, and the levels seem to recycle arenas quite a bit, and all the missions ar either ""Defeat waves of Grunts"", ""Defeat a Shinobi"" or combinations of bothCould use more boobsCould use bigger boobs.That moment you you realize you are a pervert.I do not regret this purchase. I recommend this to anyone who has an appreciation for the more round and robust things in life (boobs).But seriously, it is a decent, if average game."

76561198106239384,Recommended,502800,34235815,Posted: 14 August,all,Lunar,"A step up from its already-good predecessor in literally every way: better singleplayer, better character balance, more distinct character playstyles, better multiplayer (though, not on PC, since it's practically dead (and rife with hackers, apparently)), a neat diorama feature, actually-threatening mob enemies, and a nice parrying mechanic that I'm not even sure was in the previous game; character customization is also much improved, outfits being able to be worn in both pre-transformation and post-transformation in any combination, letting you wear transformation outfits in your normal form and vice versa. The roster only got bigger in this game - no characters removed, only added, which is great. Although the multiplayer is mostly dead, there are organized places to find people to play with, such as Discord servers. The addition of teammates in the singleplayer is warranted by the new fusion aerial rave and aerial rave interception mechanics, making team fights more interesting in multiplayer as well. I'm also glad you no longer have to be at 20% HP to use your Ultimate Secret Ninja Art - you just need the five scrolls. The crossover/guest characters are interesting in that they don't have transformations, and can use Secret Ninja Arts right away, although with the stipulation of not being able to use the full-health restoration tactic."

,Recommended,502800,34247184,Posted: 14 August,all,amiavamp,"The words of this series' producer will forever echo in eternity: <Plots> are life, <backstory> is hometown.It's Senran Kagura.  You know, that series about big balloons.  You might think you know exactly what you're getting into by buying this.  Beneath the fanservice, though, there is actually a game, believe it or not.Pros:+ Gameplay is a solid musou/beat-em-up/fighting game hybrid.  Most levels consist of fighting large waves of enemies, followed by a boss fight.  Movelists are simple and easy to memorize, but each character feels distinct, and they have some tricks up their sleeves that the game doesn't explicitly tell you about.  Attacks have weight to them, and you'll need to learn the timings for block/dodge cancelling out of moves to keep afloat on higher difficulties, along with being able to read the opponent’s moves.  (Yomi’s not called Yomi for nothin’.)+ Lots and lots andlotsof waifus to pick from.  Every character from Shinovi Versus makes a return, along with some new additions, including an ornery old grandmama, and a girl who is the living embodiment ofHYPE.+ Dressing room and diorama modes allow for plenty ofdoll dress-upcharacter customization and silly shenanigans as you please.+ Very good port, running at a steady 60 FPS with no issues and supporting most sane and some insane resolutions.  Even a relatively weak computer should be able to handle this game with no issue.+ Lots of polish put into the game's visuals, especially in the animation department.  The first time you hit that Shinobi Transformation button, you'll see where most of the budget went.  Special moves (called Ninja Arts) and even some basic attacks have their own special camera cutaways to make them that much cooler.  That kind of thing, along with some fun attention to detail (Yumi's iceboarding ""sprint”, for instance) really adds to the eye candy.+ The soundtrack isexceptionallygood, consisting mainly of instrumental J-rock along with some unusual pieces, like Haruka's theme, which is a saucy blend of traditional Spanish and French music, and the themes for the Gessen Academy girls, which are all remixes of classical pieces.  Every character and every stage has its own theme, and most of the Shinobi Transformations are designed so the animation syncs up with the music for that extraoomph.+ Ninja Arts are no longer extremely overpowered, as most of them have a long startup and can be avoided if you aren’t caught in the middle of something.  Also, Ultimate Ninja Arts are now easier to use, no longer having a requirement of being low on health.+ Mods exist for those whose perversion quota is still not satisfied, or who find that the girls are tooT H I C Cfor their tastes.+ An extra plus for Daidouji, AKA that character who will cause you to think ""one of these is not like the others."" Another half-plus for Kagura, which would be a full-plus if she was not DLC.Neutral:+/- The combat is overall a lot slower and weightier than Shinovi Versus.  Some people might prefer it, while others might find they prefer playing at the hyper-speed of Shinovi Versus.+/- Japanese-only voiceacting, but it’s high quality, and there’s subtitles for English, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese.+/- The story is mainly focused on comedy, as opposed to Shinovi Versus, which was mostly serious in tone.  It’s typical self-aware ecchi anime writing, but if that’s your thing, then it’s more than satisfactory.  The more serious elements that do exist in the story are quite dark, and it’s almost upsetting that there isn’t yet a Toukiden-style Senran Kagura game that involves fighting yoma.+/- Gameplay is repetitive and doesn’t have great variety, but the amount of characters and their various quirks will keep it interesting to the end.+/- Multiplayer exists, but is not very active.  Recommend getting some friends together if you want some competitive action (assuming you can convince them that this isn’t just Boobs: The Game).Cons:- Plays poorly on mouse and keyboard, but that is the status quo for Japanese PC ports right now, especially action games like this one.  Get a controller adapter and you’ll have a much better time.- Noticeable aliasing, even when downsampling from a higher resolution.  It’s a shame, considering Shinovi Versus is aliasing-free when downsampled.- Weirdly low resolution on some textures, like the characters’ faces.  It’s minor, but considering how often the camera zooms close to the characters, it’s very noticeable.- Combat can feel clunky at times, especially with slower characters.  Turn radius is a little too slow, and dodging can be fickle.  Trades can get weird, too, since light attacks have little to no hitstun, but they do have a chance to cause an actual stun state.  Against large groups of enemies (or when fighting multiple bosses), it’s very easy to get stunlocked, which can be frustrating.- There’s a minor RPG mechanic where characters level up, but this mainly has the effect of locking away moves and making you under/overpowered for the missions.  If a mission seems way too hard, it’s probably because you need to level up the character in use.- Dammit, Yumi, you are not the main character!Overall:Buy it if you like what you see, and/or if you like fun action games that aren’t too stressfully complicated to jump into.  Don’t buy it if boobs and/or anime offend you and murdered your dog."
