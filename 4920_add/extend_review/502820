The first scene told me this was going to be an awesome experience.  The graphics are amazing.   The VR controller integration felt spot on.  The trip down to the batcave to suit up...great...we are going to kick some aZZ!!  Looked at myself in the mirror and I AM BATMAN!! The character animation followed me perfectly.  The head movement and arm gestures lined up right on the money.   The devs nailed it!   OK....suited up now lets get going.   Eh...the excitement dwindled in the batcave.   I got to toggle some buttons and pick up some things.  Learn my mission from Alfred and headed to the batmobile.   It seems the developers had an ambitious plan for this game.  But it quickly turned into a barely interactive short movie.   I picked the batwing to head off for trouble but the screen went black...the audio was working - I thought my VR visor lost connection - nope -  not even a cut scene showing me drive/fly  -  I plopped onto a building and well....the very very short story unfolded very quickly with very little interaction.    It felt like I was on a ride at Universal Studios or something.   This hardly meets the description of a game.   I am very dissappointed with this as it has so much potentional but just turned into another VR demo experience.     I'm starting to get discouraged that VR is going to have any real content.  At least it isn't a wave shooter but, if I knew this was going to be a short, kind of interactive movie I wouldnt' have paid $20.   this is worth about $1.99 -  but only if they would pay me the $1.99 for using up my hard drive space.     Pro's:  top notch graphics and optimization.   The ""game"" ran smooth and for the most part seemed polished.  Voice acting and character animation are well done.  Con's - no action - no gameplay - press a few buttons and watch the script run.    I was not batman....."

The second it feels like things are really picking up, it just ends.As the other reviewers said, it's more like a demo. An expensive demo.Wait until it's on sale."

It is a must have for any Batman fan and any owner of a Virtual reality, I will list the main features of the game:• One hour storyline that acts as prequel to Arkham Knight• Unreal Engine 4 graphics provide life like character model and environments• One of the most polished and immersive games on the Virtual Reality• Two investigation scenes with a couple of puzzles which utilize the gadgets of Batman• Additional content includes Batarang target practice and Riddler ChallengesIf you are expecting the same content as full length Rocksteady Arkham game, you will be disappointed. If you are approaching the game as a cinematic experience with high quality production values for around the same cost as a 3D cinema ticket, you will not be disappointed with Arkham VR."
76561198024603195,Not Recommended,502820,31363109,Posted: 25 April,all,dosburritos,"I get that this was released a year ago for PSVR and ported to PC, and if the Developers are wondering if there's interest for a full Batman VR game, there is. But I don't think there's gonna be much interest in spending $20 for an hour a year into the current vr market.Edit: the following was too long to add to the comments in this thread, so I added it to the review.If I spend $20 on a game, I expect it to take me past the 2 hour mark at the very least. I'm all for supporting a dev that's trying to put out good content, and I'm willing to spend money doing it. In many cases I spend my money on a game knowing that I'm going to get a fairly short experience, and the hope is that the immersion and mechanics make it fun enough to add replay value. I've felt satisifed with most of these shorter games knowing that I can pop it on and enjoy a few rounds of it, along with having the knowledge that I've made a purchase that contributes to the future of the VR gaming market.This game didn't feel like that at all, it felt like a dev that's clearly capable of putting out a full game that would blow us all away grabbing as much cash as possible with a demo. I'm really hopeful for the future of VR gaming, and I'll support it with my hard earned cash, but I also want to feel like I'm getting more out of it than just supporting a developer.This idea that we should throw money at devs just so they know we'll throw money at them seems foolish. We spent the money to make sure our gaming rigs could run VR, and then $600-800 on an Oculus/Vive. Many of us have spent a year throwing money at devs knowing we were paying to support the future of Vr by buying games and experiences that are a proof of concept, or a test of certain mechanics for movement and combat, and hoped that the game would be fun enough to have some replay value. I think we've proven that we will pay AAA money for AAA content.The VR market needs developers capable of making AAA content to make actual AAA content that will draw in more players as much or more than it needs the hardware creators to find a pricepoint that will appeal to more people.I rate this game 1/5 crusty beans."

The scenes are beautiful, but you can't freely explore them like you can in other VR games.  You travel from scene to scene by pointing a grapling gun at clearly marked locations.  When you pull the trigger you're immediatly teleported to the location.  There's no swinging through the air or experience to be had.  Once in a scene you are guided by batmans vocal contience or alfred on exactly what to do.  There's little exploration and the options that you have are few.  There's a few bad guys but you can't even fight them.   This experience is not worth $20.  It is not replayable.  You're better off spending a few more dollars on something like Raw Data where you'll spend hours apon hours in play fighting droids.And to Warner Bros and DC Comics.

,Recommended,502820,35015199,Posted: 16 September,all,Craig1287,"I'm a big fan of the Arkham series, with Arkham City and Knight being two of my most favorite games of all time. So when Arkham VR finally came to PC, I jumped straight into it after avoiding spoilers of it from the PSVR crowd.Just like the 2D flat games, this game is quite the looker. Fantastic visuals all around. Where this one differs from the previous Arkham games is the gameplay. Arkham VR is more of a puzzle or detective game, which makes sense with him supposed to be a detective. Its a bummer that they didn't go for some combat using all of Batman's gadgets and such, but still getting to use the gadgets that we do in this is really cool and fun. Once you 'beat' the game, there's still a lot of content here. Normally I don't hunt down things in games and try to 100% complete them, but in this I made an exception due to how fun tracking these Riddler puzzles were.Is this game worth it for you, I can't say. If you're only coming to this for combat or action, then stay away. If you just want to fun adventure and puzzles with great visuals, then jump on in. It's not the longest game in VR with a ton of content, but what's here is super polished and high quality.8.5/10"

To be honest, even for huge Batman fans like myself $20 is too much, I'd be comfortable with $10 - $15.Pros:- Graphics, soundtrack, script, and voice acting are all phenomenal- Story is clever, engaging, and will keep you guessing- You get to BE BATMAN, what more is their to say?- Replay value (can't say why cause I don't want to spoil anything, but it is there)Cons:- Price vs length of gameplay, if you can pick this up on sale like I did then I would say it's definitely worth it"

The voice acting is good. It's beautiful in VR. It plays great. But it ends when it's just getting started and you're left just wanting so much more. Buy it on sale, then encourage Rocksteady and Warner Brothers to make a full version of this game with more to do - I'd pay 50 bucks for this if it was this well done over a series of like 10  2 hour mysteries.But it's not worth 20 dollars and should have at least 30 more minutes of gameplay/story to make the ending (which I liked) a bit more intense. It feels like a (great) midpoint until you realize you've just solved the mystery.So yeah, please make more of these but make them much longer. It's a great adventure game cut short."
,Recommended,502820,35392526,Posted: 1 October,all,Steppenwolf,"Simple question: Is this VR title worth its current full price of 20 bucks?Simple answer: Yes. Definitve yes, if you are a Batman fan.Long answer:As many VR 'games' this one is a short experience. Around 1 hour is needed to play the story and additional 2 hours is needed finish the game again with additional Riddler riddles. Yes, this is short, but in comparison with other AAA single player games which charge 60 bucks for around 12 hours, the price is a bit high, but still ok in terms of playtime for money.But beside this shortness this title is very well polished and offer a very good VR and Batman (as Detective) experience.Only real critic I have is for the transisitions between the levels. You hear the sound of the driving or flying batvehicle, but the screen offers only the typical Steam VR loading screen. Would have been cool to have a short driving sequence, even a non interactive one."

,Recommended,502820,32118252,Posted: 1 June,all,VicBStard,"PC virtual-reality fans can now experience a much more refined version of the previously PlayStation VR-only Batman Arkham VR.Now available for both HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, Batman Arkham VR, developed by Rocksteady, the same outfit that brought us all the Arkham games- bar the lack-luster Origins, invites us to become the Batman.After a rather harrowing sequence, where the game casts you as a young Bruce Wayne witnessing the unfortunate event that inspired him to dress up as a bat, you get to don the cape and cowl.For years, I’ve been playing the wonderful Batman Arkham games, walking in the shoes of Batman as he subjects the unsavory denizens of his beloved Gotham City. But it is only playing as the Dark Knight in Batman Arkham VR that I felt like the Batman.After the introduction, a characteristically unamused Alfred suggest that you sleep in a bed rather than on the piano that find yourself awaking on. Your hapless butler suggest that you meet him “downstairs”. Oh yes, to the BATCAVE!Fitting the Batsuit is pretty awesome. And the developers know it is. They provide you with a mirror for you to pose in, the reflection perfectly matching the movement of your head and the Vive controllers in your hands. I could have spent an hour posing menacingly in that virtual mirror.From there it’s on to the amazing Batcave, complete with a waterfall. You can also see Batman’s huge dinosaur and coin trophies, a tip of the hat to his 1940s adventures in the comics. There’s also a working Batcomputer and Batman’s forensic lab.A trip in either the Batmobile or the Batwing (which is, sadly, only a method of fast travel- you don’t actual fly or drive anywhere), finds you at a crime scene. Like in the main Arkham games, this VR outing acknowledges part of the Batman mythos often overlooked by Hollywood- that Batman is the world’s greatest detective. Setting up a crime scene works so well in VR as we witness the crime projected over a deserted alleyway.The clues take us on a trip around Gotham meeting many of its colourful occupants.The visuals really show what happens when a AAA studio get hold of VR kit. The graphics are incredible totally immersing you into the world of the Batman. Looking at the fine detail of the Peguins face as I looked at it up close was like a trip to a virtual Madam Tussard’s wax museum. It was like he was really there, swinging upside-down in front of me.Batman Arkham VR makes use of some advanced VR rendering methods:  Fixed Foveated or Nvidia MultRes Shading. Both methods result in the same outcome, with the game rendering the centre of image at a higher resolution as the outside, matching the natural differences in which we see images in front of use compared to those in a peripheral vision. In graphical processing terms, this optimizes the display, resulting in a better framerate, and thus a better VR experience.Batman Arkham VR basically amounts to an hour-long interactive prequel episode of the Batman: Arkham Knight. But it is one of the most entertaining hour of VR that you can experience right now."
,Recommended,502820,34360592,Posted: 19 August,all,catnip,"TL;DR: Good, but very short. It's only worth buying if it's on sale.Batman: Arkham VR is set between Arkham City and Arkham Knight. Technically it really good: graphics, music, voiceovers are exactly like in other Rocksteady games, you can feel the Arkham atmosphere right away. However it's not really a game, it's more of a VR experience.You're Batman and you need to figure out disapperance of Nightwing and Robin. You need to visit find and follow clues to visit several areas, check facts and restore past events using your bat-technology. The story, while fairly simple, fits perfectly the one known from the main trilogy. Unfortunately you don't get to fight nor drive and instead the screen goes black and you only hear the relevant sound effects. It's a shame really, because you can unlock several famous batmobile models known from movies and tv shows (e.g. 1960s, 1989, Nolan Trilogy, Batman v Superman etc.) and while looking at them in full 3D, you just want to hop in and drive through Gotham.The main problem with this product is its length. The story can be finished in less than an hour and really leaves you wanting more, way more. If you're a completioninst, you'll be able to play longer hunting for Riddler puzzles. They're rather easy and lacking of any challenge though and the main difficulty is locating them rather than solving.BAVR is however incredibly immersive. You really do feel like you're Batman, you really do feel the dark atmosphere of Gotham. This, to me, is enough to recommend this product, however only at a deep discount."

It was so rich and alive.  The detail of the world was unmatched in any other VR experience.  I have been playing VR almost exclusively for the last year and never realized how good it could look.-Characters.  There are characters that feel more alive than any Digital Character I've seen in VR.  The acting and the facial animations were captivating.  I found myself just staring deeply into Alfred's dreamy eyes.-The Opening Scene!  I think I experienced a fear I had forgotten about.-Graphics.  I'm on a 980.  I had 180% supersampling and the performance was flawless.  The foveated rendering is done well, and was unnoticeable.  Really shows how wasted all the rendering is on the far edges of your view.  Awesome stuff.Cons:Overall, the biggest issue is that I want to be Batman, and this game only satisfies the detective side.-You don't get to drive or fly your vehicles.-Not a full game.-No combat.-Left me wanting.I don't consider the length to be a negative.

If you have played all of the Arkham games, you're probably kidding yourself if you think you want another 20-40 hours of the same gameplay they've done in 4 games now. This game is stripped down to the elements that still make the franchise worth returning to.A) The storyB) Feel like Batman (Now more than ever)C) Mark Hamill's JokerSo back to the price. Experiencing being batman in VR is easily worth $10. If you're a big fan, it's priceless. As a complete package, this AAA quality game is the equivalent of $10 DLC mission by today's standards, but it's VR. And let's also not kid ourselves, we all hoped for full-length AAA games for VR by now... but the reality is they aren't coming until Bethesda ports old games this fall and onwards. So if you're reading this still, ""lower your standards"", buy it and enjoy it OR put your headset in the closet for a loooong time."

I really think they need to lower the price on this game to like 5 - 10 dollars or even free. granted there might be DLC's or something that might release down the road but as it is its not worth the 19.99 i paid to play this game. i will get a refund and wait for it to go on sale to buy it again"

,Not Recommended,502820,33487442,Posted: 12 July,all,"Hussar, The Winged","This is the first VR game I did not enjoy. Interaction with the environment is limited to the boring objects around you. Whenever you get to an interesting part (combat, for example) your vision goes black and youre left to listen to a bunch of sound effects to tell you how cool everything that you can't see going on is. Your utility belt is visible, but relies on your headset for alignment, so if you turn your head to the right and look down to get something off of your belt, you'll realize the game exects you to turn your entire body instead of you head (which kind of defeats the entire purpose of motion-tracking headsets...) You spend a long time looking into a mirror, your model has that wierd perma-flex stance that Arkham Batman has, but is also tracks your movements so you see shoulders popping out of sockets and other oddities as the game tries to make sense of it all. Youre forced to watch yet another scene of Thomas and Martha being murdered, but this time as little Bruce looking up at his parents. It may have just been me, but I felt like Martha's model was disproportionate and really creepy. Luckly that nice man Joe Chill came around the corner and shot those horrible big-headed monsters before they could eat me.I think my biggest complaint was how little I actually got to do. Its a Batman game, let me punch something! Superhot did it... Why didn't you Arkham VR?"

The content is fairly well done, but it feels like they barely touched on the surface of what the game could have been.  There are cheaper VR games that are much better for content, so it's a bit surprising to see this from a AAA studio at this price.You do get some cool, ""Wow, I'm Batman"" moments, but without spoiling it the story quickly feels very non-canon, so there's something lost there.As a VR experience, I'd say it's only worth the full $20 if you have friends you can share it with, but even then there's some caveats.  One of the main draws of the game are some of the surprises, so if you have a group of friends over you really need to tell everyone who hasn't played it to leave the room so they don't spoil it for themselves.  It's also rather dark in an adult way, so it's not an appropriate VR game for young kids, and also dark enough that I wouldn't have my parents try it.If you find it on sale for $10 or less I'd say it's worth it as a ""VR experience"" style theme park ride.

While I can see a great amount of polish in what's here, I think 20 bucks is 10 dollars too much for something like this.  I knew what I was getting into when I bought this- a port of a relatively short experience that was on PSVR a year ago.  But being eager for good content for my Oculus and having played through previous Arkham games, I knew this was a day one purchase for me.  If you're one of the few that are asking for this to be ported to 2D so you can experience this without having a VR headset, don't- you're really not missing anything here.  What occurs here storyline-wise is inbetween Arkham Knight and Arkham City but even then it's not canon, so you aren't missing anything.  The main draw of this experience is to ""Be the Batman"" and to feel the scale of the Arkham world first-hand, if you're looking for a substantial game- you won't find one here.  If you're eager for VR content and are a fan of the Arkham games or even Batman in general and don't mind paying 20 bucks for something that should have been 10 (if this is on sale for that much, this is a no-brainer), then you'll be happy with this."

All beautifully done, with fantastic graphics, music and atmosphere.The gameplay is mostly puzzle oriented and takes alot from the detective/analyze sections from the Arkham games, and i'll tell you..it's really cool to actually play this in VR style. There are also a ton of riddler goodies to find, as per usual. The only negative about this is the short length (1 hour for campaign, more if you want to get all the riddler goodies etc).

Check out my first Batman Arkham VR gameplay video on HTC Vive:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EC5rF_S6E0As far as I know, the storyline may only be an hour or twpoop hours long, but belive me if I say that this VR experience is a real blast! I never tried the PSVR version, but this PC releases really shines. The graphics are just amazing, its hard to describe how realistic, polished and detailed everything looks. This is probably how VR games will look like in a few years I guess.As for the gameplay, well yes this is a linear storyline and you are interacting in a sequential story-based VR experience that takes you to the Virtual reality version of the Gotham City. This is not a real ""game"", as most of the things happening are pre-rendered and you only slightly interact but cannot really change much of the outcome. But the VR immersion and sence of presence is outstanding and as a movie based VR-experience, this is definitely the best one out there so far!Give it a try, you will get amazed. If you dont think its worth it, you could always do a refund - but Im sure you will get satisfied!"

The main story campaign took me about an hour and 20 mins to complete, but is other side content that unlocks at the end so I will have more to play.People will moan about the price for the length, but the quality is superb and for me was easily worth the cost.Big thumbs up from me...and I'm Batman!"

It's super immersive being in the batman world... and the devs have been very thoughtful about crafting the experience. For 20 bucks... I wouldn't expect a full-game... and I think the price point is just right!1. The graphics are just amazing.2. I've had VR for over 2 years now... this experience has invoked new emotions of awe!3. This has proven and raised the bar for what a batman franchise can do from a VR gaming perspective4. The thoughtful sound design in this game are amazing. (Pick up the phone in the living room, and see what I mean!)Overall, I really loved the experience. People say it's short... but I really don't think I could go beyond the 1 hour mark on this one. I think the duration is just perfect! There's actually additional content after completing the main storyline... so there is actually some additional playable content that pushes it past the 1 hour mark I'm sure! (Most probably don't bother exploring further... and then give it a negative review which is kinda sad!)Hope this review helps... and please give this a chance, support the devs and give this a try! I personally like it a lot... a must buy experience if you've already invested in VR... don't pass it up!"

In each scene, take a moment to look around, let yourself experience the immersion of being inside the Batman universe, not just watching it through a window.This VR experience is about an hour or so depending how quickly you solve the puzzles or fiddle with the extras. It's actually hard to wear a VR headset for more than an hour at a time so the duration is just right. Replaying the game will give you the same experience, there are those that say this means there's no replay value, but I disagree, obviously there's replay value on a ride at Disneyland or Universal Studios. This isn't gameplay so much as it is an experience that's meant to thrill you, if you like being thrilled and engrossed in an awesome Batman tale then there's replay value.Bottom Line: Is it worth the price? The production values in this title are awesome, this is a perfect game to showcase VR to friends or anyone considering purchasing one. The requirements are light, the experience is awesome, if you're a Batman fanatic then $19.99 for what you get is a deal, I'd strongly recommend owning this title before showcasing your VR to anyone, but you can wait for a sale if that isn't going to happen any time soon."

The experience is by far the worst I have experienced in VR for the price!! This is not a 29.99 game more like a 9.99 game. The entire game can be experienced in less then 1 hour as a matter of fact I think I completed it in like 50 minutes! If I spend 29.99 dollars I expect to get at least 29 hours of game play. Another thing is the fact that there is no Batman experience what so ever you have a few gadgets you point and click on things but other than there there is no combat or challenge to the game what so ever. This game is a big fat whopping turd of turds for games. Do not waste your money.

Familairity with those games improves the experience, but the Case Files section can get you up to speed on the other games if you haven't played them. Don't expect any combat going into this; gameplay is almost entirely puzzle solving.

It was so great seeing yourself as Batman and me flexing my muscles in the mirror in-game. If you want to experience being the Dark Knight, then you have to purchase this. I just hope the developers will add the Batmobile riding experience where I just don't see black screen and just hear audio, WE want to experience being in the Batmobile as well, we don't have to drive it, but let us experience that we are riding them or the Batwing. But this is a great example of what the future gaming would be. I was just thinking and imagining how would the fighting would be like. I would love to have some action in the future."

With that said  at this point in time for VR they have done a great job. the content is short unless you make the most of it. It exceeds expectations in the cinematic story in which unfolds in front of you as  The Batman. The graphics are pristine. Though you are immersed in the world it really doesn't have a strong gameplay element. Not to be much of a spoiler but they use a very innovative story control method that I haven't seen since the vr game Quanero for a fight scene. All in all I would say purchase the game support the devs in setting a new par for vr tittles. And hopefully if they start to make new Batman games in The Tell-Tale fashion the next Batman will have a little bit more content and be a little more in depth with some of the ideas they sratch the surface with."

There is some extra stuff that adds replayabilty that I haven't touched yet.  Not exactly sure how much extra gameplay that will ad.  As it stands right now I'd probably say hold off until it's 10$.  What Is did play was well done and it's definitely one of the better looking vr games.  I like the graphics options as well.  Runs great on my 1070.

My favourite part was looking in mirrors (amazing!)But - its way way too short. Ok, to do all the riddler puzzles at the end would stretch it out - but I finished the game in an hour - and I wasnt even trying. And I had to repeat the lab section, because I was interupted (had to pick up my son from the train station).The story is pretty good, but its very much on rails. I actually found parts boring. The final bit (no spoilers) was clever, and I liked that - but sadly I just didnt like the game. Some (easy) puzzles, but no fighting. I did like the batterang target game (the riddler version). But once you get over the initial ""wow"" factor (and this game has that in spades) - its like a very basic ""where's wally"" game, albeit in 3D. Dressed as Batman.And thats a real shame - VR needs games like this. Just they need to go for a lot longer. And be more fun."

From other reviews I was surprised at how many game aspects were included, such as the scanning and batarangs, but it is still very much an experience. The game looks beautiful with hands down the best character models I've seen in VR. Most likely they got away with this because there's no way to interact with the character models.The motion controls don't require precise movements and it seems this was to work with PSVR tracking but it still feels really good.

(Decending into the Batcave and seeing the Giant TRex & Penny is a nice touch)Like a lot of tech demos, the gameplay amounts to going to different locations, scanning stuff & solving very light puzzles - and while the effects for each gadeget and tool are impressive - it's just hiding some pretty basic stuff. Don't go into this thinking you'll be doing any fighting.Highlights have to be experiencing Batmans origins from young Bruce Waynes perspective & a sequence involving cages.Make no mistake though, calling this a game is pushing it & asking full price at £15 is a stretch.

The gameplay however, is non-existent. Ocassionally you get to press a button or teleport to a strict designated location. There's no locomotion or movement whatsoever. The interactive items within the game are very, very limited. But, the worst part is, they tease you with the cool bat vehicles that you dont get to use at all. The entire experience is over in less than an hour. Its great that you get to see yourself as Batman, but that really is the best part.

The graphics are top notch and close if not the best ive seen so far ( april 2017)The gadgets are cool and the bat cave is awesome. I cant wait for a full arkham release on VIVE!!!As for all the negative reviews____ They are a bunch of trolls who beg for AAA content then complain when it doesnt deliver on their impossible ""standards"" I think this was more of an experiment to see how the content is accepted... im dissapointed in the vr community honestly.. The more AAA games the more vives sell AKA more and better games for us early adopters!!!"

Yes it's way to short but this is quality over quantity and if you can take your time and appreciate the environments I belive you will leave satisfied at this glimps into what a full batman VR game could be
,Recommended,502820,31383791,Posted: 26 April,all,Yangyin,"While very short, what's there is pretty good, though it feels like there are a lot of missed oppurtunities, the most noted example of which is where the game presents you with the option to either take the batwing or the batmobile to your destination, and then, instead of giving you a bit where it shows you hurtling through gotham, just fades out to your destination, with only a variation in sound effect used. Why give me the choice in that case? While some things like that feel like there's oppurtunity unexploited, the actual game has few real flaws within itself. This is more of a detective style mystery story, and there isn't any fighting to be had, the aforementioned detective work is really good. Seeing holographic fight scene reconstructions and scanning corpses in the morgue is well done, and while there's not much to be had, what there is, is pretty solid. I just hope this isn't Batman's last foray into VR."
,Recommended,502820,31383657,Posted: 26 April,all,The NoobZMaster,"This review is written after completing the FIRST CHAPTER OF NINE (Origins), just like most reviewers that say there's too little content.Graphics: very good, Unreal Engine's muscle really shows hereStoryline: kinda meh, mostly problem with Batman being a narrator to himself (talking to himself in a loud, declamatoric voice, why? A slight mumble or whisper would do much better job)VR immersion: look at yourself in mirror when you have the suit and flex your muscles. You will be amazed.Controls (VIve): touchpad underused, grip buttons overused. Expect to work with touchpad only to go forward somewhere, and grip to grab any object you might grab. Triggers are not used for object manipulation, which is sad.Overall the experience is quite cinematic and some cutscenes are reminiscent of ""A Chair in a Room"", with lots of play with player's limited field of view.In conclusion, you should buy it. It's a nice game for your everyday VR adventures, there's enough content and a bit of replayability, the graphics and immersion are really nice, and hopefully with next iterations the storywriting will get better."
,Recommended,502820,31383037,Posted: 26 April,all,LeChuck,"The game looks completely spectacular and is fun, but I still wish it had been more interactive, having you flying or fighting.I can't wait for a game like Arkham Asylum in VR where you can move around freely and have cool environments to explore, and has good acting and animation like this one."
76561198303109265,Recommended,502820,31383475,Posted: 26 April,all,VRT,Too short but displays the true potential of VR. It's like being in a movie.  I wish you actually had a script to speak while you were playing to make it even more real. Unfortunately it'll be about another year or so before something that fully engages this technology drops. Until then I'll keep waiting.P.S.Maybe wait for this to go on sale. It's a bit pricey for what you get.

Although i wish it was longer for the price, it was an interesting experience i just wish there was replay value here but sadly there isn't any at all.  So would i recommend this game? Yes and no wait for a sale. Right now it's not worth it. It's basically like TheBlu but more expensive. There isn't much gameplay other than it being like a VR movie."

The graphics look very good and the mechanics work nice.Tok me about 1h in the first playthrough but the secrets make you want to spend more time there.No fighting though.Definetly pick it up on sale.
,Recommended,502820,31364453,Posted: 25 April,all,[RIP] SpaceBaldy,"I'm torn.......wait a minute... I'm Batman!  No seriously, I'm torn.On one hand this is a graphically and audiably amazing experience.  On the other hand it is short (at about an hour) and lacking in content.The set pieces and interaction within the Batcave are amazing and this is how I expected VR to be when I first booted up my Vive over a year ago. There is not a great deal to do but what is there is undertaken with polish and style just like the Rocksteady Batman games (after Arkham Knight was patched!)At times it feels like an interactive movie as it is extremely linear and I can't see much replayabilty other than for achievement hunters or hardend Batman fans.Movement is via 'teleporting' using the Batclaw or a single press on the tumbpad to fixed points within each scene. I really wanted to explore the scenes especially the Batcave and drive the Batmobile but you are limited to ""look don't touch""If you are looking for a experience to showcase VR graphics or just want to be The Batman this is it.But......on reflection worth it for the 'I'm Batman' moment alone during the suit up with extra value from the Origin scene.No longer torn.  Recommended."

,Recommended,502820,31377868,Posted: 26 April,all,TheMattShaw,"Okay... I played this for 45 minutes and finished it. I could technically refund it because let's be honest - the price is a joke. I feel like that is cheating the system though because those 45 minutes were entertaining. It was good to be The Batman, the graphics are polished and the experience immersive. Can't really call it a game though, it is a VR demo showing what is capable in the VR world. Hopefully the developers will take this idea and turn it into something more as that I would play all day long.There is no motion sickness. You more or less stand still, occasionally reaching for something or taking a few steps forward to look down the side of a skyscraper. The world around you feels crisp and polished. You basically go from scene to scene with a few (simple) puzzles to solve and this element of the ""game"" reminds me of an old xbox game that, for the life of me, I can't name. You have tools, you look around the crime scene, you put things together - that's it.I won't remove this game from my library, it is a good introduction for people into the VR world who want to see the potential available. The only sticking point is the price. £15 for a game that is a good few months old, a straight port and done in 45 minutes... That's not steep - it's vertical.That being said I can't NOT recommend it based on the price. The price is high, you have a choice as to whether you want to pay £15 for a potential hour long experience. Up to you."

,Recommended,502820,31593587,Posted: 6 May,all,Agent Smashing,"Played through this twice, it's a great tech demo and the graphics are beautiful.  Also I feel the horror tag would be appropriate for this game, there are definitely sections that are scary. At only about an hour even if you take your time, this is just barely worth the 20$, it doesn't make you really feel like batman as the arkham games normally do, more like a disembodied pair of hands solving easy puzzles.Overall I'd recommend it to die hard fans of the arkham games or those who want a great piece to show off their Vive."

I really liked the Idea of having multiple tools at the belt. Furthermore, the movement by teleport or grapplehook allows a nice heigh difference.They can easily improve this in the final version. I did not play the Batman games before but the VR version in my Vive is great, dark and realistic. The role switch to a child is also a cool idea with the lower camery perspektive. Combined with the mirror in some parts of the demo, it really improves the immersion effect on the character. One of the few demos that are worth their money ! okok, lets call it a ""short game"", not a demo :)"
,Not Recommended,502820,34263268,Posted: 15 August,all,johnmakuta://checkmate,"DO NOT BUY!!!!!I was extremely excited to play this port of the PSVR launch title but I was extremely dissapointed. This excuse for a batman game has worse graphics than any ""Arkham"" game I've ever scene. It barely strikes me as something that had any level of developement put into it. The story I was hoping would raise this title above the rest of SteamVR shovelwear but it instead is the equivalent of the most basic cashgrab-Shonen-anime that is sold by it's IP. Even at the discounted price of 15.99 I can't feel that I got my money's worth."
