,Recommended,502940,25467161,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,CAJJI,"Great game with a very fun base concept. If you enjoy multi-tasking and physics-based mechanics games, I'm sure Calm Down, Stalin.HOWEVER, the game often times feels rushed. Once you reach a point where your desk is completely filled with items, you question how often the gameplay was tested. I sincerely like this game, but there are some simple ""bugs"" that are nearly game breaking.Currently I think this game would be hugely benefitted by:-Restraining the objects from passing a certain points on the desk's axis.If I throw an object too far down the table, I may not be able to reach that object for the remainder of the round. If I knock my phone out of my hand with my other hand (that's another bug by the way), it can also fall BELOW the table. Why not restrain it if it's never supposed to be there?-Fixing the phone's recall leap.It landed on the button 4 times in a row when I was starting off. Other times it just gets stuck. In this case I'd consider removing the physics aspect of this and just making it dash back into receiver if it can't be fixed otherwise.-Creating more space for objects.Unless the grabbing can be tweaked to work more precisely, it's too frustrating trying to grab objects that are cluttered in the small space you have. The punching bag for example, introduces another task without it DIRECTLY getting in the way of others, which is good. The small space also makes it much easier to accidentally knock objects out of reach. Maybe throw in a shelf?"

,Recommended,502940,29693313,Posted: 4 February,all,A very hot piece of Kek™,"A without a doubt interesting little game.Calm down, Stalin takes place during the cold war, and you play as. Who else? Stalin, who fends off an enemy invasion simply by menancingly holding his finger above the large red button which will launch an attack on the rest of the world. The game progressively gets harder, as you are given more and more chores to tend to, such as answering your phone, hitting your poorly working office lamp and later on assassinating people.At first i thought this game was just a simple time waster, and to some degree it is, however there's more too it than meets the eye.For example:-You need to maintain the integrity of your country, which slowly but surely worsen with each 'story' mission you do, abruptly ending calls, or not answering them at all will decrease the country integrity after you've unlocked the phone-You get stressed by things around you, smoking your pipe is a way of relieving stress but you can't do both that and hold your hand near the button so you will need to spend every second you get very wisely to avoid getting invaded, having your country colapse or accidentally launching an attack.You shouldn't expect to get thousands of hours worth of gameplay out of this, but it is a entertaining game to boot up now and then, and it's nice seeing a game with a silly premise get released these days but actually have a bit more to it than ""Lel gaiz, looks it's so random xDDD"""

,Recommended,502940,33158811,Posted: 2 July,all,RoberTime,"Calm Down, Stalin is a simulation game starring, of course, Stalin. This is a simple game involving doing specific things at your desk such as working and reducing stress, all within a span of time to proceed. Your main focus is the Red Button and a timer on the wall to show how much of a threat your enemy is to invading the state. You cannot have the timer reach the top nor can you push the button in each level.Going deeper into gameplay, there are several options of levels to play after finishing the first introductory one. You can choose to proceed to work on the two factors you should worry about, that change between levels based on the one you've selected, as well as your performance. First there is Tiredness, which worsens the ""Stress"" gained in each level, and Stress, which gradually goes higher, can make managing tasks controllable. Tiredness can have major changes by several optional levels. And then there is Integrity which is the respect you have to the state. This can be tweaked if doing tasks correctly or incorrectly. And just like Tiredness, it can be changed significanly through optional levels. As you progress through the story, you unlock more objects and tasks to use later on.Now for my experience playing the game, it was a bit hard to control and getting to know the mouse controls at first. You can pick up objects with the left button, drop with the middle, and right-click to change hands. The game also has controller support but I don't recommend it. As for main gameplay, it was an interesting experience playing through and surviving for a small period of time. But it was also a bit stressful for me considering all the micromanagement you have to do in the later levels. But I love how the music tends to fit the mood of panic. This game's structuring reminds me of others like Five Nights at Freddy's for the element of survival.However, the game can be buggy at times. For example, when you try shooting targets or stamping papers, sometimes it won't confirm the event or I just suck at targets that it's precise. Also sometimes thrown objects can hit the button causing me to reset. The game tries its best to make sure objects don't trigger the button that it doesn't register as a push of it when it lightly touches it, but in unfortunate situations of me playing the final level, I had a few objects get tossed and hit the button. I even had one being tossed high off the screen, and falling directly on the button :CAnyway, aside from Tetris, this is my other favorite Russian-style game. Quite the thrill playing it. Again, sometimes stressful, but it's still a good game if you like political satire. I give Calm Down, Stalin a 7/10"

But still, it's playable.Two thing that I would suggest the developers do is add a cooldown to the vodka (so there is a timer that shows when vodka is available, instead of just limiting players to one vodka per level.) As well as this, I feel that a visible 'stress' meter (or some visual cue to stress instead of just the shaky hands, such as the screen getting darker) would also help players (as they can recognize more easily how stressed Stalin is, when Stalin is getting more/less stressed, and recognize when Stalin is calm enough to dangle his finger next to the nuclear button).Also the revolver culd be improved by adding a visible thing showing what it is aiming at."

,Not Recommended,502940,30505400,Posted: 14 March,all,Kurs'd Arriator,"Strangest waste of my money I've ever had.Sure, the idea of the game is fun. The game itself is fun too (if you look past the fact that middle click is used to drop items, and left click is used for only ONE out of hell, I dunno, 13 or so items). But it gets too frustrating too fast due to awkward physics boundaries leading to items getting permanently stuck out of your reach, the fact that the GDMN phone won't stop ringing, and you can for some reason only bend your arms just far enough past your torso to be able to hug yourself.With one arm.Because unless you're holding the constantly-ringing phone, switching hands will automatically lower your other arm. You were hoping to smoke The Pipe and threaten The Button at once? Fat chance....please, fix these, and I might just give the game another try."
,Not Recommended,502940,31886760,Posted: 21 May,all,Centenia,"This game, is not the best. Granted, I have an old laptop for gaming but the graphics aren't the best on the high settings. I had to put all of the graphics setting to their lowest just so I didn't get lag.On top of the that the game isn't very balanced in terms of story progression, in my opinion you should  add a way to decrease fatigue or increase nation respect (or whatever it is) every level. I would get pretty low in fatigue and the only two side options avalible are just ways to raise nation respect. On top of that the story map can be a bit confusing, at least add a text box or even just a help button that give a short explination. It's an okay game, if you have a bit of money to burn and are extremly bored you can buy it, I just don't recommend it."

I have a small gaming channel on YouTube called JrinceGaming!I recently did a playthrough of Calm Down Stalin and my first episode is on my channel now. If you want to see gameplay of this frustratingly hilarious game.https://youtu.be/7fNBlsZnjMYCalm Down Stalin very much reminds me of a surgeon simulator spin of a game. It is a really fun idea and the gameplay albeit simple it is really fun to do. The power to launch missiles with a big red button is fantastic. You have no idea how many times I accidentally smack that button or the flying phone flips into the air and lands on it ending the entire world.The goal of the game control the arms of Stalin, threaten to launch nukes to keep your enemies at bay, answer phone calls, manage stress by smoking and drinking Pure Russian vodka. This game is cheap and you will easily get your money back from the addictive gameplay.Hope you guys check out my channel!

Restarted several times. Nothing (and let's not even get into how the supposed solution requires digging through random discussions until you find one with the answer). The screen flashes a few times, the Unity window shows up in the task manager, and the icon shows on the task bar, but if I try to switch to the window it goes into seizure mode with the flashing and throws me back to the desktop."

After a few levels they start adding more things to make it harder. Now you're going to say ""Whats wrong with that?"" to which I would answer. The game is very VERY easy, I could play this game blind folded, an easy game isn't really a game. I find this game to be overpriced ""You can't afford $5"" you will say, There are much better and interesting games by indie devs for that price, all you did was download unity ""guessing"" and make a very very simple game. I'm no expert when it comes to making games but I do know to and have made games. This game should be worth maybe $1-2. But of course people will pay for it because it's a stupid game with no replay value.. which is funny because the entire game relies on replay value."

You take control of the arms of Joseph Stalin to complete the tasks of the nation by answering phone calls, stamping documents, and threatening enemies of the state by means of nuclear warfare with your finger on the button (not figuratively in the least). A plethora of distractions stand in your way in the form of a flickering lamp, political dissidents that need to be shot, and good ol' fashion stress (remedied with vodka and pipe smoke). The controls and coordination take some getting used to, but after you figure it out, it is not really that bad at all. There are enough stages and achievements (which personally, I found the names of the achievements to be particularly funny) to keep you occupied for hours. All in all, the game is worthwhile if you just want to kill some time in a silly manner or just to live out your fantasy of being a dictator in charge of a nation."

For example, some items keep on making a lot of noise when placed on the table, as if they were constantly hitting something, even though they are at rest. Also, I am sometimes unable to pick up items.In my opinion, this game should therefore still be in early access. Had it been still in early access, then I would have given the game a thumbs-up. However, since the developer and/or publisher has decided to declare the game as finished and release it in its current state, I will give the game a thumbs-down, at least until these issues are resolved."

The game helps ease you into each of the mechanics, giving you a level where you only have to deal with the new mechanic and nothing else (other than the button). Each of the mechanics have a little""things""  to it, like a phone that rings, if you fail to pick up or hang up, you lose integrity, or punching bag that helps keep away stress, it was always an enjoyable when I find out I get a new toy to play with, and then tear my eyes out when its fully encorporated.Then there are the frustrating parts.The button is placed right next to the phone and if you accidently move to get the phone too low, you press the button and its game over for you, which happend to me about 3 seconds away from victory :(. It also gets a bit too hectic, you have to multi task... as far as I recall 9 different items, which, if you are bad at paying attention, will screw you over  in the endAnd thats my very speedly made review, in the end, its a quick game for an okay price, I would like to see it dropped a bit, it will make you rage, it will make you weap tears of joy when you beat the insanely long final level, and, there are quite a few youtubers you could watch to get a feel for the game and see if its your cup of tea, thats how i found it, anyways thanks for sitting through this, have a good day :D"
