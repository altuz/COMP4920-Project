It is fun for while it lasts, but I would suggest waiting for the developer to release additional levels. I have played for two hours with my girlfriend, and it appears we are 80% complete. There are 12-ish levels.The trailer is basically the entire game. One player navigates for the player that is wearing the headset. The navigator views a map of the level from a top down perspective. It is akin to the old map views in the original Doom. The navigator can view the entire level, enemies and all. This view allows the navigator to direct the player wearing the headset. Occasionally, the navigator can imput commands, or hacks, to assist - like disabling a patroling enemy. However, we have barely used them to complete the levels. The levels thus far have all been single floor - one floor with no stairs or elevator or ledges to a second or third floor.The player in the headset can sneak, walk or run throughout the level. He or she has no weapons or items to really interact with inside the game. You can collect keys by walking into them to unlock doors. You will also relay passcodes and observations to the navigator.Visuals get the job done but are very bare bone. Again, reminiscent of first person shooter gamers. Basic visuals ensured that I had a stutter free experience with a 980ti and i5-4570.The concept is unique but would have liked more depth. One of the store page screenshots depicts a console that states ""trustno1"". I hoped that tied into the actual game somehow - some sort of story that might make the person in the headset question whether the navigator was actually on his or her side and/or motives. A meta that disrupted whether the players were aligned together - akin your assistant in the beginning of System Shock II. Alas, that was me reading far too much into that screenshot. There is no story, explanation or anything. Although ... looking back, I am fairly certain my Girlfriend deliberately lead me to my doom on a handful of occassions.That said - Black Hat is one of the more polished VR games that I have played thus far ... just kind of shallow. It shows the potential for these type of VR games with a player at the desktop computer and a player in the headset. Remains to be seen whether we will ever get there. If Team Future Games released a game ... in the future (heh heh) ... where the roles are flipped - the navigator tries to stop the headset player, and the headset player can hack and defend himself - I would totally be into that game.On the topic of motion sickness. With my Girlfriend, I played in the headset the entire time and never experienced any sickness. The initial session lasted an hour. First time in a game with locomotion that I did not experience motion sickness. War Thunder in a plane made me ultra dizzy. The free Wizard VR game made me sick. Black Hat was a welcome relief. Pushed it to the limit too - sprinting, moving backwards, moving slowly. No motion sickess, so that was a nice change of pace. Regrettably, the Girlfriend cannot say the same. She put the goggles, moved a step in game, swooned in her chair, said ""whoa"" and then immediately took them off. Refuses to put them back on. Take that for what you will, but I think if she was willing to give it another try, she would adjust.** Edited for clarity."

It's helping him with his left and rights, map reading and other skills. He really enjoyed playing it because 'we got up to level 3 in two days'.That's not to say that it's only good for kids, or even that it's made for them. Indeed, I expect it will get too hard for him as we progress through the levels, and I'll need to get my wife to help. Still, It is fun to play VR games with local co-op.A couple of requests: please add some antialising options because jaggies in VR are horrible, and keep on developing other locomotion options - I prefer the first person perspective over the third person, but it needs some tweaking."

76561198390344875,Recommended,503100,32907857,Posted: 27 June,all,worlds.edge.llc,This game is always a hit when I have people over.  I also started a VR business and the publisher was very responsive and easy to work with so I could provide this game to my customers.  The assymetrical gameplay engages everyone in the room and makes it  solid game.  It definitely shows how unique VR can be if you add a bit of creativity.
,Not Recommended,503100,30255685,Posted: 28 February,all,Cabby,"I really like the concept of this game.  I hope other games will follow in its footsteps.  However, this particular title was not made very well for the Vive.Head tilting is not registed in the game, and room scale is available but not really useful.  You move around with the thumb pads, but your character moves very fast.  This game will easily make you nauseous; in fact, the first time my friend entered the headset to play as the spy, he couldnt last 10 minutes of gameplay.  I drove him home and he immediatly threw up when walking to his front door.This honestly feels like it was originally an Oculous Rift game that wasn't properly ported over.  I don't know if that is the case, but at any rate, its unacceptable in its current condition.  I have a really high tolerance for this kind of stuff.  I once used Google Cardboard to play a ghetto SteamVR at an abysmal refresh rate.  I've used various styles of 3D glasses/monitors.  I've never gotten sick to my stomach like this game has done.  Again, great concept, literally unplayable as it is now.  Requested a refund."

I first thought I'd get motion sickness from using a controller and moving without moving but I didn't.  I really really hope they come out with more levels and even a level editor to create your own.  Would pay for map packs for this game and even new traps and such.  It's a great team building and couch coop game.  Highly recommend it.  I saw in the menus that is supports both controller and vive controllers, I played with a wireless xbox one controller for PC and it was great.  The other person on the couch just needs a keyboard.  Hacking the guards and doing a freeze or blind on them is definitely great as well.  It's fun for both players.  Please make more levels!I'd like to also say it's not about the graphics, I've seen some negative reviews saying the graphics are not great, it's 100% all about the gameplay and puzzles the graphics are fine and don't require to be any different."

,Recommended,503100,32000811,Posted: 27 May,all,RaggityMan,Awesome game! I'm loving these vr games with local multiplayer. It's a bummer that there are so many people giving bad reviews for the movement. Just don't use the right controller to turn. Instead turn your body and you should be fine.

,Not Recommended,503100,35034681,Posted: 17 September,all,Tamrae,"Poor game. Developers are deceitful. It is listed as multiplayer so me and my friend in another state bought it to play together but it is only local multiplayer. Devs need to remove multiplayer from the list and note that it can only be played locally. If you do not plan to play with a friend in the same room, do not buy. Unfortunately we bought it during the summer sale before trying it today so it is too late to get a refund."

I would say there is definitely a good amount of content and replay value for ten dollars.Overall, I had a great time playing it and would recommend it highly."

Totally worth the price, my only complaint is that it's so cool I wish there were more levels. So many of these VR games are so pathetically short, it's frustrating. Still, this is great while it lasts and is totally worth buying if you have a friend to play it with. (You NEED two players for this game.)"

,Recommended,503100,24646314,"Posted: 31 July, 2016",all,Forsakenmike3000,"very very sickening. amazing concept but cant play in vr. Ive been able to play windlands and such no problem. But its not just me here. I had a room full of friends try this out and as fun as the game is and the concept of it the movement within the Vive is just not right. If you were to play this game on two back to back monitors or something its badass! Just the type of game id love to in VR if maybe we could figure out a way to make it less sickening.The movement is VERY touchy on the trackpad also.Recommend game? Yes,absolutely.Recommend game in VR? No."

I threw this up here as a community service - you wanna drop 10 bucks on something thats broken? Be my guest. Otherwise, you are welcome for the warning.The game is broken in more ways than one (as of 7/30/16). Don't buy this until its clearly fixed.People want to know how the game was broken for AMD users as of 7/2016?1. It crashed most times in the starting menu2. It crashed everytime when loading into the game (when we got past the starting menu)EDIT: I have not revisited this game since, and have refunded.I don't even care to waste time in explaining the ways it is broken - needless to say we never actually got to experience game play.I highly encourage you to browse the forums to review potential problems you may run into."
,Recommended,503100,24735792,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,2SPOOPY4U,HEADS UP BEFORE YOU BUY.There is a very good reason why a lot VR Games do the teleportation thing and this lets you move freely.However that dosnt sound as nice as it turned out to be incridebly sickening. Almost with in 5 min of playing I really felt the need to hurl as you are moving and your body does not feel it so its not tricked like with the teleporting.Concept seems awesome however if you are prone to motion sickness then stay the hell away. Shame too because it seems really rad.UPDATE: Dispite that the game still should be given a shot. But if you are sensitive like then you may wanna try the alternatives but thankfully its not something that holds the game back!
