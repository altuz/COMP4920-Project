,Not Recommended,503210,28878153,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,Mister Kipper,"Sentry Knight Tactics is a brutal game.But it seems to happen more by carelessness, lack of QA and balancing - than by design.This seems to be further supported by the about 6 freezes as well as minor bugs found during the playthrough.After a few hours, you will find yourself controlling 4 separate characters, each with 3-4 abilities. You have to select and command and move them individually throughout the fights - although you can issue an ""attack with all"" order, you cannot select multiple units or move more than one at a time.This is troublesome, as the fights in the game are either slugfests, where you easily dispatch the same groups of enemies repeatedly for up to 30 minutes, or plagued with combinations that will kill one of your 4 units in under 2 seconds if you're not paying close attention, which usually chain-reacts into defeat.Although the game seems visually attractive and polished at first glance, a closer look makes the rushed parts stand out:Terrible controls for microing 4 characters; problematic hitboxes, both in and out of combat; 2 of the 8 available characters are 80% copies of another, with different skill names; lack of real party diversity (there's only one tank - and one healer for 75% of the game);  bosses that can 1-hit non-tank characters and change targets randomly after casting certain skills; loot dwindles as monsters become bullet-sponges and shop prices quadruplicate; ""unique"" effects on legendary items are most of the times completely useless even though items are not procedural; skill trees are laughable, with negligible values and effects all over the place (5% chance to avoid 50% damage! 10% healing on a skill with 30s cooldown!); consumables activate automatically and the vast majority of them are absolutely useless (single use: when you use your 30s skill, reduce its cooldown by 3!).The more you play, the more you find - questionable design decisions are lurking around every corner - spoiling what could've easily been an amazing experience.Perhaps you'd like to push forward, tredge through these issues to follow the adorable characters and their story to the end. Well, that's what I did - and yet here we are."

Units taking attacked in the back take no extra damage.Speaking of formations, it gets tedious to unravel your party when they are piled on top of each other.Characters will WASTE TIME goin around an enemy to attack on the other side instead of just killing them.Feels like you can max out equipment too easy or soon.You are limited to 4 characters while the enemy can have as many as 12 units on screen.This is a baby sitters game, you have to baby sit your inventory, you have to baby sit your characters in battle.  If you like this style of arcade click festing your units then this is the game for you.  I hate games where you win or lose based on how fast you can click and issue orders.Some people genuinely like this type of game, but if you are looking for somethign with more depth... look elsewear."

76561198091295265,Recommended,503210,25887623,"Posted: 6 October, 2016",all,stewnwt,"Ok only 7 hours in - but great music, suprisingly challenging combat with multiple classes of characters, simple but variant weapon and armor crafting system. Skill progression very similar to the old Wow skill trees in Cata expansion era. Numerous side quests, hidden goodies. Art style for me enjoyable, but not for everyone,  very very similar to Castle Crashers.Make no mistake, I'm playing this game on regular mode and it is keeping me on my toes (and I have 40/40 achieves on Hammerwatch, including Hard mode Survival, I'm no slouch). Each battle plays like a mini MMORPG battle, sort of like the trash mobs in WoW raid instances. Mechanics must be respected and there are a reasonable number of types of enemies that like to hurt you in different ways, and if you don't pick up aggro, position/re-position your characters responsively, manage your abilities and cooldowns (particularly the Priesttess' heals), characters WILL die and you WILL get overwhelmed by mobs.The writing isn't Tolkien but it's light, funny and the plot ticks along at a reasonable pace. Hard mode I anticipate would be damn challenging.Characters obtained so far: Knight, Priesttess, Hunter (starting trio), plus Rogue, Witch, Archer.I have to say I bought this title thinking it had potential and it has delivered. Can't promise it will blow you away but a very solid and highly enjoyable title. It doesn't look like there'd be a ton of replay value but extrapolating from my skill tree progression and the fact I just started Act II, I'm guessing there's about 25-35 hours of game in here. Definitely have no hestiations recommending it. Really look forward to more titles from this developer. Sentry Knight Tactics displays a highlevel of polish and the meat of the combat is very enjoyable.Pros: Colourful and accessible graphical style.Combat is easy to learn but tough to master,Good degree of challenge on normal difficulty.Decent length, mutiple party members and can customize party.Quality music, though number of tracks is limited.For me so far, completley bug free.Cons: Overall a little simple in most regards. Pillars of Eternity this is not.Can be a bit grindy (though personally found it balanced).Customizabillity of party limited by Knight and Priestess being pretty much indispensible.Overall = 9.0/10***Update- 16 hours in. Got the Warlock and the Shaman. The shaman is more demanding for positional requirements to keep your team in range of her totems and use of her cooldowns but if you have the skill she's superior to Priestess as she can attack and heal simultaneously. And yes combinging her and the priestess (the poor priestess needs a damaging holy spell or two) for boss fights makes them a lot easier.I have to admit the shammy surprised as I was expecting another plate wearer - instead there is one plate, 3 leather and 4 cloth wearers. I feel the witch suffers a bit in terms of balance compared with the much preferable warlock. Eg. Why does the witch's talent tree have her cooldowns decreasing only 1.5 per second compared with 2 per second for the warlock? The shaman is really a surprise because she plays so differently compared with those 4. Plus her talent tree is beautifully illustrated - lots of colour.The knight, priestess, rogue and shaman are the most different classes requring the most individual skill, mechanics and management to play ie. they play differently whereas all four of the witch, warlock, marksman and archer you pretty much play them exactly the same way all 4 of them - straight up ranged pewpew. It's really a matter of taste which you go with (if you pick any of them at all).If you guys ever do an expansion (yes please), I would suggest dark knight (plate, slightly more risky tank), and maybe something totally different like a minstrel. Oh, and a la Final Fantasy VI's Pheonix Cave and Kefka's Tower, the 8 party members are BEGGING to be put on a storyline quest that splits the group into two parties that battle separately. Also, the warlock and archer need lines - realize they aren't main storyline characters but they are well voiced would be nice to give them some personality along with the other characters and involvement in the story.Oh btw, one change that would REALLY help is if you can see all 8 party members from the equip screen - please look at changing that in a patch, the inability to do so makes inventory management a bit of a pain at present."

It has an almost identical playstyle, but I would say is slightly more difficult:1) cooldowns are longer, so can't always be used recklessly.2) more environmental damage to dodge (fire on ground, etc)3) characters only auto attack if they take damage or are given a command (slightly more micromanaging, but fortunately there is an attack-all keybinding)4) even on Normal, must sometimes kite enemies to succeed (Again, Knight always takes aggro)5) like Battleheart, must prioritize targets and focus fire, or you'll die.I've been waiting about 6 years for exactly this type of game to come out (Battleheart 2 changed the original style and completely♥♥♥♥♥♥the bed), so my perception of the game is biased. I love the game, and have put about 10hrs in and I'm probably a little more than 1/2 way through. Fun, worth the $9, and totally satisfies my nostalgia.There are 8 characters btw (Knight, Priestess, Rogue, Hunter, Archer, Mage, Warlock, and Shaman), and you get 4 in your party."

The option is still there for anyone who desires it, but theres now also the choice to use a more common rts style of having selected characters and clicking to do actions such as moving/attacking.The gameplay itself is fun and challenging enough that even in the early stage of the game im at, it's keeping me at least slightly on my toes. The abilities are fun to use and plentiful with their relatively low cooldowns and the number of them you will have available to you over the course of the game. Having a fair amount of simple exploring to do in the overworld is nice, it's certainly not going to keep you searching for long, but I think it's a nicer choice that just selecting the next battle/area to attack. Here you can avoid combat if you like, or go looking for it in the form of monsters seen in the overworld, and it brings you to a combat area where you will engage whatever it is you ran into.The loot system is simple and easy to use, and it's enjoyable to gradually upgrade all your characters gear along with finding more interesting pieces. If anything I feel like the gear comes a little too easy? But I've not yet played long enough to really understand just how powerful the early game legendaries are.If you've heard of Battleheart for mobile, then you'll feel right at home with this. Fun to play, and the story so far, albiet a little generic, is engaging enough to keep me reading. The different difficulty levels are a nice feature to encompass all gamers, and I believe if you like the sound of a party based rts game, this is enjoyable on several levels.Lastly but not least, the developers for this are very vocal, friendly and seem geuninly careing about the furthering of their game; great to see."

There is no UI, so you cannot get any information about what is happening on-screen, once it is filled with stuff.You got AOE and attack effects all over the screen, you got enemies and heros all over eachother in layers, making seeing HP bars very hard.As a player, I cannot select the hero I want because I cannot see or click properly onto thier sprite.Aslo, there is some kind of creeping UI mouse lag, that gets progressively worse in longer battles, making fast mouse selections and movement clicks either lag, or just simply not happen.Its a good concept, but poorly presented, with some really annoying, play-impeeding UI bugs.Cannot reccomend at this time, unless these issues are fixed."

Your characters only do something if they are attacked or if you tell them to do something. Your first healer does nothing if attacked. She will just stand there and die if you do not notice her being attacked. I have played MANY party management games because I enjoy them so much and all of them have some sort of party AI to an extent,  but this one has none. No one thinks for themselves. You have to think for the whole group. Thankfully you can now hit keys to switch between characters which helps some, but when you have nine monsters on the screen, it is a nitemare.When you start out, it is pretty easy to get ""Legendary"" items, but after a while, those ""Legendary"" items are not so ""Legendary"". When I got my second extra party memeber, I found a weapon that is almost twice the damage of my other charactes weapons that was for this new party member. I have yet to find a weapon for my other party members that is in the same damage bracket. A better variety of weapons would be nice. Could be that I just have not gotten far enough yet.At first you gain levels pretty easy, but the grind is for real. Also, don't expect to not die. Dying seems to be just apart of the game.This is a fun game and I like a challenge, but it really needs some balancing and AI mechanics for party members.  Maybe even an AI that you can set up where If character A is > 30% health focus heals on them. Balancing might not even be needed if some sort of AI for your characters is worked in."

I really like these kinds of games on mobile platforms so perhaps I'm a bit biased to start off, but this game stands out from the typical mobile platform games by being much more in depth, visually appealing, and actaully contains an existant story with random other little scenes which are both actually pretty entertaining.Being able to use a keyboard and mouse to contol characters is quick and accurate. Which makes the game even more fun and less frustrating. I've always hated fumbling about and dragging my dumb finger around a touch screen.Neat mix and match from multiple heroes to use in your active party along with proper skill trees and equipment stats adds some nice strategy and rpg elements. Also has a very actively involved developer on top fixing any new bugs/issues to keep the game at its best."

There's also a fair amount of inventory management, with you keeping track of items for each member of your party as well as breaking down junk to upgrade your gear.There's also a bit of party management with different characters to swap in and out of your party when the situation calls for it. On top of that each seperate character has their own unique abilities and skill trees to upgrade, allowing for different styles of play.The art and animation are very well done and add to the cute and goofy humor of the game.For 10 bucks it's a solid casual indie RTS that you can't go wrong with."

BUT the developer commented on this saying that they are testing a new control set (click and click) right now! Can't be more happy with this developer!If you like how the game looks I would suggest to give it a try. I did not know what to expect but really like the game so far. You'll receive quests from ''peasants'' as the knight calls them which is nice. Other than that you will be batteling a lot of enemies, leveling up, choosing perks, following the main story to safe the King and the land and meeting new heroes. You can have a party of 4 but there are I believe 8 heroes in total. You start with the Knight, Priestess and Huntsman after which you will be joined by another hero (no spoilers). So it is up to you who you want to join the party. I have not seen much of the main story yet, but so far it is interesting.For some the battle system may get repetitive, but I don't really mind.
