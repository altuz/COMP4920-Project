,Recommended,503300,25939706,"Posted: 8 October, 2016",all,jiamdead,"Super Star is a light hearted and simple time management sim (with partial vn themes) where you ""raise"" a would be idol to excel in several areas: singing, acting, modeling, etc. It does take a few playthroughs to get full achievements/cg's. The dev also released a full uncensor patch for the game through Steam. There are no ""hentai"" scenes, but are some mild nudity scenes now, but nothing too extreme. To see what I mean, and unless they're taken down, just check out Steam's screenshots section of the game.I enjoyed playing this game. I also understood most of the cultural references and even though poorly translated, I understood 99% of the dialogue in the game. I do wish the translation was better, but due to the recent price reduction, I doubt the translation will be any better than it is. Really, if not for the translation, I see no reason to give this game a negative review. If you at least TRY to understand the dialogue, it does get pretty interesting towards the end. There are even some funny and amusing moments in the game. The dialogue reads as if you listening to an Asian speaking English, who learned it from a textbook.Overall, and especially now for the price, the art and gameplay are pretty good. If you play the game with an open mind, you're more likely to be amused by the dialogue rather than overly critical of it.One last thing, the Dev was pretty involved with this game and seemed really friendly to me. It shows a Dev cares about their product and customers when they go out of the way to offer partial refunds or even extra keys to those who paid full price, after the price drop."

,Recommended,503300,25456143,"Posted: 10 September, 2016",all,IAmKEVIN,"I understand why people would rate it down and say it's just hentai and nudity. It's all due to the extremely poor translation.Because of the terrible translation, people generally can not understand any bit of story, especially when developer use the movie name, songs, TV shows and artist reference from forign countries.I, happen to understand the original language of this game, so I 100% understand and love the story line, also the main girl is very attractive to me (Maybe this kind of girl is exactly my type). So I absolutely willing to spend 10 hours on this game, to get all the achievement, all the endings (2) and unlock all the CGs (I SS all the CGs and store them in the folder).Even though this game really copy lots of stuff, for example the main girl's design, but hey, to put all the good stuff and make a better stuff is also some sort of creative, eh?You generally absolutely need at least 3 play through to complete the whole game, but most people take 4, because even though you will have all the permanent buff on the 3rd play through, you will not know how to effectively manage your time, you will almost always end up wasting days on something un-relate to achievement, CGs or progess, and so make you not able to get everything before the 3 years end.So for whoever read this, if you want to complete the game as soon as possible, be careful on your time management. (2 tips, you will need or I should say ""only need"" around 9000 on all stats, you will not able to improve your stats through learning after you reach 8500, so it is better to buy the items from the shop to boost the stats after you reach that learning limit.)To sum up, this game has a decent story, good amount of achievement and good relationship development (even though you have no way to interact with the main girl or any of the characters) to keep you entertain. I will totally recommand this to whoever likes to play visual novel type of game."

Learn to type Braz zers or something else into google.So I thought this would be just a cheap VN game with a little skin. And it is. But it’s actually a half decent (and half crap) career sim game.  You have to decide what path (if any) your going to take.  There is a limited amount of time (game days) you can play and then it’s over.  So plan the achieves or relax and see where you end up.On my 1st pass I was trying to become an actor … and getting sidetracked constantly.  I did OK but mostly sucked.  The next two passes I did better and better as I realized what I could focus on and what I could hold off on.The skill (career) path is capped, so plan on the add-ons and other factors to try to get those last high end jobs.  I’ve had a couple of over 10k skills but it isn’t easy to get over 8,500. You’ll understand if your trying to get the top career path achieves.After each game you get “diamonds” or whatever you want to call them.  These are used as permanent boosts for the next play though.  Use them, it makes it much easier to get further into the game.There is also in game money to buy skill boosts (clothing).  A lot of time this is cheaper and quicker than training. And when you’re getting down to the last few days, grab as much as you can afford to do to max out the post-game diamond count.You’re looking at 2 – 4 hours per game depending on boosts and your choices. You’ll probably learn everything you need to know after 2 or 3 games, but the achieves will take at least 5 passes to get (or more if you want to see the games and get all the photos.At $2.19 CDN not on sale, it’s cheap enough to pick up for the 10+ hours you may get out of it.  Just don’t expect to see a lot of skin in the game.So what’s the down side? Translation is sub-par, it does get repetitive and the paths to the achieves are not always obvious. Oh and the few topless scenes will only ever come up when somebody else is looking at your screen :-)1¢ ReviewPro:CheapLow system specsNot actually a bad sim game (not Civ but not bad)A few PG13 scenesAchieves & cardsCon:TranslationRepetitiveNon-obvious tasks to optimize careersPush:MacOSOverall: 5/10 +1 price, +1 different career sim, +1 not bad art, -1 translation = 7/10"

Buy a nukige instead or something.It's a VN with gameplay / management elements and i like those. It's a good kind of game to play like, before going to bed or something.Also i find it funny how the girl looks exactly like that girl from the one story where an asian dude married his DS.If you didn't hear about that story, he basically married a girl called Anegasaki Nene (The lookalike) from the DS game called ""Love Plus"", which is actually a fun game, but i digress. I'm just impressed by how little of a heck you'd have to give to actually marry your waifu. I bet that man exists in the anime dimension by now.But i joke, i joke. The creator seems like a cool guy, offering to personally give people refunds on Paypal if they're not happy.Makes me wonder why people who make porn games are usually chill, like Akabur for example.Must be a higher state of being."

,Recommended,503300,28710253,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,the_rock0123,"I picked this up for 79p in the winter sale and the trading cards I got are worth 41p – that’s what I call a bargain.  It just so helps that the cards for this game are really attractive and some of the best I’ve seen on Steam, so I’ll certainly be collecting the badges.To start off by reviewing what everyone is interested in, the ‘star’ of this game is the girl seen in all of the advertising, and, as far as I know, she’s the only girl that will become your girlfriend and be seen in some over-exposed pictures.  So if you like her you do, if you don’t you don’t.  Other games like HuniePop offer a greater variety of women, and even more risqué photos and better excitement (but you do see a lot in this game too).  As you progress the game your photo album will build up so you can refer back to photos at your *ahem* leisure, if it takes your fancy.Aside from this, despite the fact there is little by the way of tutorial so you only really understand the game (it's strategy) at the end of a few gameplay years, the gameplay is actually very interesting and more challenging than it initially seems. You have to build up your star in a variety of talents using point and click learning, jobs, tasks, etc. Talents include singing, acting, modelling and you can make CD’s, go on talent shows, participate as a TV host, make films.  A key is to specialise to aim for achievements quicker.Each game is time limited and lasts 3 in game years. The end result is how well you perform at jobs and how well your skills develop.  A full game of 3 years lasts approximately 3 hours and you would need to do at least 3+ games to get all the achievements, probably more, so 9+ hours of gameplay (more likely ~20 hours) for 79p is cheap as chips.A good bonus is there is a nice selection of achievements to strive for, 100% completion appears to be possible if you’re willing to put in many hours to this (at least 9 in my view, depending on how quickly you read or skip text).*Strategy Spoiler* - A tip on strategy is to be aware of how to spend your gold as learning, like jobs, increases your skills the more of an unbroken chain you can complete, so be wise and spend gold only to keep long chains running, as you will run out of gold eventually. And always use gold for key events like singing competitions, else you won’t win them.My ratings:Risque Content 5/10Gameplay/Sound/Graphics 8/10Price 10/10Trading Cards 10/10Overall Rating : 82.5% - a Must Buy, especially on sale, if you’re interested in casual management games, point and click or anime.  The full price is worth it too.  I don’t think casual gamers will regret this buy, it’s a welcome break from deeper games, and this game holds up well against poorly made AAA titles that don’t offer gaming value or are poorly made – this is well put together.  Congratulations to the developer for a wonderful game and for being so fair to gamers with your pricing."

It's easy to understand though and the art is pretty nice, the girl has tons of costumes. I'm pretty sure there's only one track so I quickly muted it and put on my own music.Overall it is a decent experience.

Through the course of these 3 years you have to build the girl up so she is the most popular female in the world through movies, music, and modeling. You build up her talent to take on some tasks which takes 1 day or sometimes 2. As you go through the game the story actual gets somewhat good and has lots of characters and funny celebrity camoes. The only issues with this game is it has the same music playing throughout the whole game which has like 2 or 3 pieces of music. Also the some of the art looks blurry in some pictures or it might just be my monitor since it renders the game at a high-resolution but just a minor complaint.Overall this is a good game to pass some time while your watching a movie, podcasts, or even YouTube videos with how simple it is.

The whole game feels like a sort of virtual fruit machine without any real prizes. The art is fine... and then I saved after 90 minutes of play and found that my save game was broken on return... there's no way on earth, I'm going through that nonsense twice. So, I'm out.Pros: Strangely fun, trading cards are worth a lot so if you get this on sale -you effectively pay 25 cents for the game (which is about what it's worth), boobsNegatives: Game play makes no sense, translation is pitiful, didn't go any further than boobs...I'd like to put a neutral rating on this but as it doesn't exist.

76561198369459568,Recommended,503300,32131217,Posted: 2 June,all,ryanjoshuamaliwat,"The game has a very compelling motivation.The game begins by making a point to show that you own a new company that's doing poorly. Immediately after that exposition, the game introduces you to the game girl that you may name. Obviously, she's very beautiful. She tells you that she stays with you for only 3 years and she will leave when your time with her is up. You two decide to work together and build your company from the ground up...however as the player what TRULY motivates you is not the company's progress, but the progress of your relationship with the girl. The player is hooked to play because there's a 3 year time limit. The player is motivated to find out what happens, how it happens, and, most especially, if there is some possible way to make the girl stay indefinitely after 3 years.Although the game is labelled with ""sexual content"" and ""nudity"" tags there is minimal actual sexual content in the game. However, the game's artistic content more than makes up for this in my opinion and the motivation the game gives the player is sufficient enough to hook the player in this simple point and click resource-management game."

,Recommended,503300,31124560,Posted: 13 April,all,Bearboots,"I picked up Super Star because it was on sale, I like visual novels, simulations, micromanagement and you probably won't believe me but these oversexualised games I find pretty entertaining because of how ridiculous they can be but also how in some cases, they have excellent stories or gameplay hidden beneath those first impressions. I spent nearly 10 hours with the game and even wrote a completion guide for it (there wasn't one strangely enough?).Is this game worth buying, yes if this is your type of game. You can see some solid effort went into it. Some of the art is quite good, story develops, clever little missions that you complete, the stats system works, clever gem system that makes future playthroughs easier, cameo appearances (Bruce Lee is in it? And Sheldon from Big Bang Theory... it's weird but fun) nice gallery and costumes etc. However, there are some glaring issues. To the devs, I know this is an indie game so I say this with love because you should keep making games but fine tune future releases.1. The English translation for this game is not good. You can understand what they mean but there were times where I literally had to reread a sentence a few times because of it being lost in translation.2. There were several instances where there were clear bugs. For example, there was a critical moment where you tell her you love her and it said 'I love you [name}' come on man devs! Was that intentional?3. The storyline is actually pretty clever but lacks depth. A story about the girl in your videogame coming to life? That is actually a great idea and I would have loved it if you expanded on the actual story. There is a decent visual novel in here if you have the time to write it.4. No male or female swap option. Most games in this genre will allow you to select at the beginning if you are male or female. It's not that much effort to put in and makes your game more accessible to people with different sexual preferences.5. The artstyle is inconsitent. There were a few drawings of her in different movie roles where I was literally blown away by how well done it was but this standard wasn't maintained. Same goes for the cute drawings when she is doing different movie jobs, the Mario one was so cute, why wasn't this carried over to other jobs at that level of detail? Hit and miss for me.6. The music. It's not bad, but it's not good enough for a game that has no other sound in it other than the menu selection sounds.7. Where the heck is the OPTIONS MENU!? I can't change settings!?!?!?8. The completion bonus is not that great. I was expecting more for something I had to play through 3 times.So yes.. buy the game. It's silly, made me laugh and will keep you entertained for an afternoon.Or you can just look at her ♥♥♥♥ it's your life. You be you."

All the adult scenes or pictures are very soft indeed.Well now for the game itself, what to say... ther'es not a lot to say actually : the graphics are cute, the dialogs are funny, the story is cool and the whole thing is no brain and kind of a nice breeze. The main problem is the english translation which is really poor but enough so you can correct yourself most of the sentence and get the right meaning.So why do I recommend the thing ? It's cheap, and it's quite of surprising in some ways : the game has a LOT of references to the geek world. It is a gentle game, not anything really perverse here. Really, it's a childish game except for the ecchi features. And it's a good kindhearted game, even more because it costs almost nothing. It fullfill its ambition, and I approve the work done. Really, nice work here, you've lighted my heart a little during something like three days."

I'm a tad embarrased that I bought this title, however, I will forge on and try to be a gentleman about it. Okay, I did purchase the game because I wanted to see her ...sorry.This game is very sweet and adorable, and cute. Our hero wakes up one morning and finds he has a very shy and beautiful, and sassy, young girl in his bed. It turns out she wants him to make her a star. In turn she will ...reward our hero (and the player), with a glimpse of what we all desire.The story progresses, and we learn what it takes to create talent. It's fun and a great way to pass a few minutes for only 2 bucks, in my world that is an unbeatable bargain!This game is to be enjoyed :) There is no violence."
,Recommended,503300,29637829,Posted: 1 February,all,Belmont ™,"Bought this on a dare. Surprisingly, it doesnt have strong adult content, and it does have some interesting achievements to accomplish. This is more of a point-click-complete task game with a timer where each task, class, and event lasts a couple of days on your timer. Your goal is not to have intercourse and not to be a pig, but to help assist a one-night-stand into becoming famous, which will be determined on your outcome of supplying classes, training of singing/dancing/charm/atheletics/ect, and picking which branch of work you'd suggest them to accomplish.Overall, it was interesting and a little captivating, but in the end, you can find much better games (and adult content) elsewhere online.... Easy 10.00 for a bet."

I have no desire or intention of trash talking the game developer or writer/s.As evident, Super Star is a visual novel, meaning the entire game experience involves reading text, but the developer and/or writer speaks English rather poorly -an assumption made based off the in-game text- with poorly constructed sentences and misplaced words, it gave me a headache rather quickly trying to arrange the text into a legible order.I -sadly, because I wanted to try this game- only played less than 10 minutes as I just could not read the text without groaning. Like I said above, I have no intention of trashing the dev/s or writer/s this is just a heads up to anyone who may be like me and find it hard to read bad English.For its price though I cannot consider the game a waste, it is really cheap and if you have the dollar to spend, have at it at the very least hopefully it will help the Dev to whom I wish luck in his/her future endeavors."

It's basically a clicker when you're trying to complete the tasks and events.pros:cute story lineeasy tasks which means easy achievementsbrain dead game (?) - this can be a pro or a con, It would depend on your game stylecons:too easy lolthe art isn't really that greatI can't really think of other cons, I truly enjoyed the game, I love the time and money management features whileI was leveling up the MC.ps: I'd suggest you to do the events that gives you more money as rewards, as your attributes gets higher you are going to need more $$$$, each events will require you a certain attribute level to access them so you need to stack up your money & Make sure to read the guides too as they are very helpful!I played the game without the nude patch which is okay with me, but if you want some extra dough feel free to download the patch ¯\_༼ຈل͜ຈ༽_/¯"

It needs someone to go through with an actual english translater and clean up the language in a BIG way.  Otherwise - the game is simplistic and easy to pick up and play. Easy to learn. It is tagged for nudity but there is not any and it does not really need it.Plot? Interestingly there is one buried in all the other elements. And a very interesting love story there too. This would make for an interesting visual novel instead of the kind of dating sim management game that it is.Is it a great game? No.  But it is a great timewaster when you have a bit of time to kill and you want something to do that does not require a  whole lot of attention.I enjoyed it for what it is.

But then again, it isn't complicated per se. I assume there are no hidden skillsets needed, since a game that is going to program elaborate skill mechanisms would (at least I hope) have hired a high-school translator?Even at $1, a part of me feels I overpaid. I'm going to give it a ""No Recommend brown step taste"", will change it if (by some super happy space joy beam miracle) things improve."

Here’s an image of her:http://imgur.com/trHHmaC— even the art style is similar, especially the eyes.- Speaking of art style, there’s an inconsistence of it; our idol girl is drawn on a certain style, and all the other characters are drawn on various other art styles, which doesn’t make sense at all.- Actual people/characters show up on this game. Like Sheldon, from The Big Bang Theory. (you wish I was joking, right. But here’s the screenshot:http://imgur.com/H7wF14T)- The English translation is horrible. I read certain scenes again and again, and I couldn’t understand what they were talking about. It made no sense.- The gameplay is actually… Not so bad. Status raising games can get annoying, but for some reason I found this one… okay? There’s no choices to make, you only do “quests” to raise your status/money/fame.That’s it, that’s the game. It’s too expensive for what it’s offering, and it gets boring after a while since it’s ALL about status raising, you basically don’t interact with the girl.I only recommend this if you like to play weird/bad games like me, if you’re a fan of ecchi (even so I don’t think it’s worth the money), and if you just want to laugh at the absurd that is this VN. Or you can gift this to a friend to torture them too.3/10.Also the ending sucks lol"

Typos, mistranslations on every scene. On one point, it makes you run laps in vain ('The Ex' event, where you have to build up charm instead of acting skills).- The story isn't anything particular, and becomes boring easily.- With the diamond system, after a playthrough, it becomes super easy.- Gold never runs out. With a bit of micromanagement skills, it will never drop below 500 (or in my second case playthrough 1000) at all.- You can't buy much with money and you can't donate money to help your cause with sheer numbers. At the end of my playthrough, 2+ billion cash piled up.- I can't really get what does 'charm' have to do with cooking skills. Pretty much nothing, that's for sure.- Nothing requires 10k+ fame points as requirement, yet, you can build it up to 18k+.- High fame point doesn't affect sale numbers retrospectively on songs, movies and ads.So there's a lot to improve on this game."

You basically click trough it.it got a little weird at times, to the point it was just sad.I would rather recommend the game ""Catherine"", it also has some weird japanish situations but actually has a story and playable puzzle content."

I can tell the guy that created it put a lot of passion into it, and despite there being a lot of badly-translated ""Engrish"", I think that makes the game more humorous (even if it is unintentional). Not to mention, from what I've seen in the creator's update history, he just seems like such a sweet guy in general. This is only a $2 game, so I'm more than glad to throw a little bit of money this guy's way."

It's a bit strange, and the translations get a bit wonky at times to where you get the general idea of something but your specific goals could be unclear. Not a bad game by any means, and it goes by quickly. At the end you get special gem currency, so replaying is encouraged. Easy achievements and it does have trading cards."
