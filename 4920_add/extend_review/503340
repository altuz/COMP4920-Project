76561197992525604,Recommended,503340,24932548,"Posted: 15 August, 2016",all,Vulpeculus,"I first was like -meh-The motion system is weird, there are not a lot of environnements, only one game mode, ... I tried the tutorial and already thought about a refund.But then I started a multiplayer game, and I had one of the funniest time with my Vive to this date. I literally laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off at some times.The game is straight forward, totally no-brainer.You scan the area to locate players and weapons, then dig your way to them by moving and punching cubes.You die a lot and frag a lot.PROs :- Easy to play, games are fast paced, it's instant fun.- Lots of (funny) weapons,- Environnements are fully destructible. They are just filled cubes made of smaller cubes, and you shape your playground with fists, bullets and explosions.- lots of masks to unlock (I don't know how yet, though).CONs:- There doesn't seem to need a lot of strategy nor skill... But that means that anyone can have fun, no Munchkin nor powergaming.- The motion system is weird (you move ""step by step"" forward or backward with no transition), but at least it prevents from motion sickness. I don't understand why you're not allowed to move laterally, though.- Everything is destructible, even covers, so roomscale covering and ducking do not seem to be that useful (you die too fast anyway).- The immersion is not the best I've seen (everything goes fast and moves are jerky, dodging and ducking seems useless -see above-, that does not helps make you really feel like ""you are there"") but the fun and clarity are there.Some moments to help you better understand why I recommend this game:- Stealing the weapon from the hand of your enemy while he is using it, and frantically punching him in the face while he desperately tries to steal it back (seriously, this should be a norm in all shooters this is hilarious).- Dodging bullets with a frying pan, and repeatedly knocking your adversary on the top of the head with it... And winning...- Throwing a grenade right in front of an enemy who hasn't noticed you, observing him watching it, freaking out, trying to flee then exploding. One Tex-Avery moment.- Targeting an enemy with a scan through the wall with a rocket launcher, that digs a tunnel right to the target who never saw it coming."
,Recommended,503340,29734472,Posted: 5 February,all,Baphomet,"Engage in free-floating first person multiplayer combat in minecraft-style environments in Dig 4 Destruction, a room scale VR game for the HTC Vive (and possibly also the oculus touch). In each level, you fly around digging your way through walls to get to items, weapons, or just to get a better vantage point on your opponents. The sonar feature allows for all players to quickly and easily find each other making combat really fast and crazy.The only downside to this game is twofold: It’s a VR game, which means the community for it is very small AND the developers unfortunately made it so that you can do 4 player matches OR bot matches but not 2 players and 2 bots or any variation thereof. So try and get some friends to pick up this title at the same time as you if you want to get the full multiplayer experience. That being said, his game has a surprising amount of spit and polish for a VR title and is actually quite fun to play, even with bots."
,Recommended,503340,25044648,"Posted: 20 August, 2016",all,Solar,"This is a fun game when I can find people online to play with. Alot of times when I try to find a match no one is online, but hopefully this will change as more people buy the game.It has a unique movement system where you move forward in small increments while pressing the touchpad, which I prefer over VR games where you move forward continuously.It's fun to dig around and find all the different weapons, theres lots of fun ones including a frying pan than deflects bullets. I also love how if you can get close to someone you can grab their weapon out of their hand and shoot them with it.This game is lots of fun and is definitely worth it, especially since the price for it is so low compared to other VR games."
,Not Recommended,503340,26469397,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,OmegaLevelGaming,"I know it hasn't much to do with the game play, but there is never anyone on. The multiplayer was a mess when there were people on. People will go afk and take up the only available room and you can never start it or kick them."
,Recommended,503340,25102193,"Posted: 23 August, 2016",all,Batty Skengeting,"An incredible game with competitive potential, but limited by the lack of developer interaction.If this were an indie title, with the promise of growing into a game with more content and competitive matchmaking, it would be the Vive's killer app.But there's no reason to expect updates beyond the game's current state, or any reason to believe the developers would listen to any community that could grow from it. COLOPL is an interesting company with legitimately good VR games, but their releases have been treated as one-offs, likely sponsored for development by HTC, and others by Oculus. We’re looking at the finished product: it’s doubtful there’s a contract to develop the game further (but perhaps paid DLC should the game become popular?). This game is so close to filling the competitive multiplayer VR FPS void, but it ultimately falls short without official forums and the promise of more content.That said, D4D is an insanely fun deathmatch shooter that takes place in destructible arenas littered with guns. The main locomotion is done by short teleports in the direction of the headset, which means if you want to run from a fight, you have to lose sight of your opponent. I wish all competitive, arena style games (Battle Dome) forced teleporting in the direction of the headset like this. With a teleport mechanic that uses the direction of a controller, it's way easier to dodge, and player movement becomes less predictable, and much more random. But in D4D, you can’t teleport far, and you can’t strafe, so you’re forced to engage and fight when you finally find an enemy with your scanner, or turn and run.As a finished product, it’s totally worth the price. There are tons of unlocks, and the lobbies (if you can find one) are pure chaos. A game like this, with active developers, would be huge for the Vive."

,Recommended,503340,24925260,"Posted: 14 August, 2016",all,explodes,"This game is good arcade fun, with lots of polished and exciting elements.PROS- collisions work well- fun weapons- challenging, exciting, and engages my attentionCONS- head-directed movement is awkward but only at firstThere is a thing that happens when you blow up an enemy and yourself it says ""GOOD!"" With a message in your face labelled ""suicide"""
76561198001912111,Recommended,503340,25239789,"Posted: 29 August, 2016",all,superfierce,I'm really enjoying this game when people are on.  Love the concept.  There are a few minor things which I'd love to see changed/fixed.1) I don't like having to keep tapping the touchpad really fast to move at top speed.  I'd rather just hold it down.2) Sometimes the touch pad randomly stops registering taps and I can't move.3) Is digging when both hands have weapons allowed or not.  It sort of works but sometimes you don't move forward.  It just feel buggy.

Devs plz put a mode with no sonar and no homing missiles. (or make them very rare)"

You use your sonar to scan for weapons and enemies. It's very straightforward and easy to pickup for anyone.  Even if you are the best player ever you will die plenty and even if you are the worst...well you will probably get kills because that damn rocket launcher is so op if you get to it's spawn.In all seriousness this game will be a very fun game to pick up and play a few games at a time and then put down and come back later. There is loads of replayability in this game.The game feels like it could be a lot like rec room in regards to the social environment. The waiting area puts all the players qued up for the match in the same room where you can play chess, light fireworks, break ceiling fans (oops I mean shoot basketball), look in the mirror at yourself, and loads more.There is in game voice chat so that you don't have to rely on gestures. I feel that in a game like this both social and competitive voice chat is something that is greatly needed. Without it you can't hear the person laughing on the other end which in turn makes you laugh and then everyones laughing at something that had there been no voice chat wouldn't have even been that great.As you complete achievements you unlock new masks to put on your head, esentially it's your in game avatar.When you jump into a game you spawn in seperate corners and you start digging towards weapons. You can take your opponnents weapons from them if you're close enough as well! The whole game is so energetic and funny that it just works! There are several different weapons to use and try out, my personal favorite being the frying pan!I can't wait for more updates and players online!In case you want to see the game in action linked below is my gameplay commentary of Dig 4 Destruction.

,Recommended,503340,25170343,"Posted: 26 August, 2016",all,Shadow,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sFkGRgpBHkFun little areana shooter. Definitely a game to play with your friends. Well polished and intuitive.Worth the price if arena shooters are your thing but doesn't appear to be too populated yet as I never saw a joinable match. Plenty of achievements/ribbons to unlock but aside from that I could personally see the content getting repetitive quick.

Only like one other Person made it into a game of mine , we played chess for like 40 minutes and nobody joined.Im not sure if its due to living in Germnany and the Time difference but playing vs Bots .. which is the only other thing possible except Multiplayer is horrible.. they suck and usually walk out of the map and thats it.Also Performance drops are pretty intense right at the start when blocks are beeing destroyed..I have an i5 4790k @ 5Ghz & an GTX 980 OCed << this SHOULD NOT be happening.Please make a drop in drop out Multiplayer mode where one could host and it gets filled with bots at first and ppl join one at a time.Cant recommend as of now."

We had such intense fun, I wish I could show you my colleagues b**ch-slapping each other and stealing their guns from each other!I'll keep playing it to unlock some more masks, but the main fun is the fast paced multiplayer with guns.For the edevelopers, as constructive criticism, I agree this game should have a sideways movement... And also, maybe the way you drop the gun should be a bit different, for example dropping the gun over your shoulder, instead of the current fast shake? (I have dropped my gun accidentally a few times).But again, I really recommend it, so buy it, the more we are the better!"

I dont like the movement system at all. You have to look in the direction you want to move its annoying and breaks the vr for me. I dont want to steer with my head. You move at what looks like one frame at time. Its a nice looking game, reminds of dreamcast sonic game in look and feel. I think the game really breaks for me is the easy rocket launcher kills. Once someone has it your screwed. You have to dig while holding the move button but the rocket just streams through it like butter mixed with the wallhack vision in the game. Its not like the rocket is the one gun in the center everyone races for,  there spread every where so your best option is to ignore all the other guns and keep digging for the rocket launcher."
