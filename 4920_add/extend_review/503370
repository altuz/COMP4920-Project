76561198050260304,Recommended,503370,31096343,Posted: 12 April,all,Blue_Bug,"Many people know the game Theme Hospital. This is the (more) serious version of it. Although not all treatments would be advisable in real live, but it is close enough.In this game you are in charge of a hospital as managing physician.One of the nice things in this game is that you can choose your own level of micro management. You can choose just to focus on the general needs and leave the little details to your staff. So you can focus on growth and building.On the other hand you can micro-manage almost every decision your staff has to make. If you want more or less examination for a particular patient, just adjust their dossier.  You can assign patient to particular staff.  You can decide if treatments and examination must happen quickly or more precise and safe (but takes more time).Even if you are building a large hospital you can take some time to follow the treatments and examination. Although it would be impossible to  follow all patients in a large or medium sized hospital. But in principle you decide your level of micro management and can pay more or less attention to it , whenever you feel to it.At the moment the state of the game is reasonable. Please keep in mind this is still a game in development. At the moment you will notice that the game will become a bit  boring after you spend aprox. 25 hours to it. But the developer has big plans with it. So I expect that to change in future.I have the impresion that the last months the developer focused mainly on bug -fixing.The number of bugs has been reduced significantly the last months.  The pathfinder has improved a lot.  Now most bugs are out of the game the developer can focus more on new content (as happened with the last big update).For now it is already a very nice game to kill some time with it. It is a great basis for the future game. For the current price it is a great game with great potential in future.If you want to play it, please keep in mind that future patches can kill your current builds."

Development has all but stopped until very recently, and each ""fixed"" bug seems to reveal new and even more game-breaking bugs. Definitely has potential but I would NOT recommend it in its current state. Check back again in a year or two.Update 6 months later:Huge improvement. The game is even sometimes fun. There are still a lot of unforgivable bugs, including an often unresponsive UI and some really heinous spelling errors. There are a lot of objects that seemed to be purely decoration, or if they served a purpose I was unable to find it. There's still no good way to figure out what you need more of, so the game is like 50% clicking randomly on patients to see what they're waiting for and then sifting through a dozen interface menus trying to figure out why. The scheduling UI is completely useless without sorting and filtering options and sometimes isn't up-to-date anyways.The game still needs a lot of work, but at least it's heading in the right direction."

As someone who works in an EMS setting for a small hospital it is fun to see some of the stuff I see in the day to day real life being shown here with some liberties in making it a game that is fun.  This is a fun little tycoon game that let's you go as big or small and at your pace.  Being in early aces it still fun with the occasional bug. But I would get this game if you like tycoon games.

,Recommended,503370,34831730,Posted: 9 September,all,mirta000,"While the game still has a way to go, it has definitely improved! I could not even play it in May due to broken pathfinding!cons:- currently a little bit too easy. I do not actually know how to make a practice that would loose money, though I am enjoying seeing my clinic become an actual huge hospital.- too easy to quit out of the tutorial. I navigated into the wrong place, tutorial thought that I navigated into the right place, so it did not let me press any buttons until I would do a thing on a menu that I was not on and therefore could no longer get to it. Thankfully I could just quit the tutorial and figure everything out on my own (the game is not hard to figure out!)- currently (on the 9th of September) goals and emails are very split on progression. My current goal still has me locked out of placing hospital wards, however my current email is reprimanding me for not being able to keep the patients overnight and not building hospital wards.- one of my doctors got stuck after I turned half of his office into a bathroom. I cancelled his current activity, collected all the furniture from the room and put everything back in. That fixed it!pros:+ you can build and run your own hospital!+ unlock goal system gently guides you in what you need to get so you don't get overwhelmed.+ unlike other games of this type, this game offers constant contracts - you send one of your workers to help out a different hospital for a few hours, they bring back money and improve their skills. Meaning, I was never stuck for too long being unable to build and expand my hospital (getting stuck being unable to expand my prison would constantly happen to me in Prison Architect)Overall 1 year in the game is finally in a propper playable state. I can actually recommend it now!"
76561198394436569,Not Recommended,503370,34197847,Posted: 12 August,all,XDelphi,"This game shows potential for a fun game in the FUTURE, but having recently purchased it and played around for a while, I can already tell there's a long way to go and that sadly I havent taken to it like I have many similar games. Yes, I was hoping for a more modernised 90s Theme Hospital type game, and was excited that this game seemed to offer a more realistic (no bloaty head syndrome - actual routine and critical conditions that you get to aid in the diagnostic process!) take on that old classic. Regrettably, I can't see it developing into something remotely as entertaining as that any time soon. Given that it's almost a year since release, I would have expected to see a more established game with far fewer negatives.My primary initial thoughts on this game were:- Very basic interface in some ways, then other text-rich features that make jumping into the game quite complex/more so than it needs to be. WAY too easy to quit out of the game accidentally when you're just starting and cant navigate the controls/buttons.- Frustrating user controls, edge scrolling/zoom features unsophisticated and laggy.- For me, the graphics are just a little bit too unrefined. Not entirely down to the devs, obviously I had screenshots/previews prior to purchasing so I was aware of the style but in action it just lacked... the charm of traditional modern era pixel type games. A bit 'bleh' in terms of graphics quality and appeal as it's neither old-school cheery little pixel people, or edgy stylish characters. Additionaly the building process, staff actions and overall feel to the game is just rather slapdash. I dislike the building structure, the walls are hugely thick, obscure a lot of the visibility and don't make me feel like I'm building a hospital but a blocky square featuring a few bits of crammed furniture.- DELETING things! Confusing, long and drawn out, menus all over the place clogging up my screen and my mind with their unwanted presence. Too much clicking...- Sandbox?? I belived this was a sandbox game but either thats not an established feature or its way too hard to find. Either way, as soon as something requires me to follow (somewhat glitchy) tutorials, be reliant on before I've even started money, and unable to create as my heart desires, points are immediately deducted. As a lover of Theme Hospital, or virtually every tycoon game, a sandbox mode or money cheat is a vital part of my gameplaying experience. Without it, exploring is too much of a chore until I am ready to go campaign mode.- £11.99 was not really worth my expense for what hasn't turned out to be endless hours of fun as I had hoped.Don't mistake my criticism for idle dismissal of what is clearly a promising WIP from the developers and it is clearly satisfactory to some, or those who are willing to hang around for the gradual improvement, however I shall not be returning to playing this game for some time/if at all. Knowing that my review has been largely critical I do want to commend the following feature:- YAY for some realistic medical things! Proper conditions, symptoms, diagnoses and diagnostic protocols. Having some realism should make for interesting gameplay for those who arent bothered by my other concerns or who can overlook them. I especially love the features such as an emergency room, a vital feature of a hospital that distinguishes it from what otherwise might be a glorified doctors surgery. Its great to see games acknowledge the tiers of medicine can range from routine to life-threatening and offer facilities to accomodate those needs. It shows real depth of thought into the challenges associated with healthcare and I hope the Devs continue to expand on the ERs role and use within the game.- There are other features that ought to be credited given that this isnt exactly a huge developer franchise that we expect a loooot from, they've done a good job with many aspects, unfortunately its just not for me. Which is fine.I hope for those who continue to play, the updates continue to be consistent and beneficial, and that the improvement results in a successful and well-rounded game. My final statement on it will just be that if you've got high expectations, expect the diversity and freedom of something like Theme hospital, want to go big or go home, maybe this isnt for you."

My only complaint is that I completely beat the game on my first play. There simply isn't enough depth or content to challenge an experienced simulation player. I've checked out the Trello board, and the roadmap for the game is interesting.I like the concept behind the game, and will definitely play more in the future. But I'm disappointed that the game I'd like to binge on is so easy. Definitely needs more depth and difficulty settings."

,Not Recommended,503370,32397417,Posted: 13 June,all,PPanther92,"Well, back in those days, I loved to play Theme Hospital. So I find this game very intriguing.You start with almost nothing, ca 48,000 Euros (or the currency you prefer; set in a exchange rate to dollars) a handful caretakers, two cleaner ladies and vast land full of bushes and trees.Step by step you build your own hospital, buying new stuff and expand your team. And it's very funny and unlike the original Theme Hospital there are realistic diseases. Appointing your crew to overseas missions, you can get extra cash and EXP.Unfortunately, there are many bugs as this game is currently just in a very early alpha stadium. It gets a little frustrating to olad previous savegames because of freezing bugs: When there is some kind of error, patients and your stuff get stuck doing nothing.I would recommend this game in its current state only to simulation fans who can live with some freezing. It happens so often that you can't get a flow and just enjoy this game for hours and hours. I find this very disturbing.But the developers are quite active and busy, making this game more stable and adding new interesting content, so allthough I wouldn't recommend this game yet, I am sure, with the next patches and fixes it will get much much better. ;)"

I like the fact you can arrange your rooms however you want and that you can see what requirement is missing to upgrade it.The rest is generaly sending your patients through this cycle:- Consultation- Specific medical tests- run this loop around if your doctor is not efficient- Treat- Hospitalise if requiredSometimes, you will have to intervene to stop useless diagnostic on your patients if you feel having a soul of a doctor.So yeah, really, everything is there so why not recommending the game ?bugs bugs bugs, clunkiness and coAs much as I would have loved playing the game further, the user experience was disappointing- 3d aspect that sometimes confuses me for the placement of items- Windows that open in the middle of your screen at most clicks and requiring a manual closing- Random bugs like people running almost endlessly between rooms to see that there is no room, missions being stuck,Other features that will need some improvement in the future:- Staff idling like they're bugged, would be nice if they could show some sign of life- Patients could stay in the same office for general discussions then diagnostic if it is in the same room- See the history of patient that left the hospital- missions that make you earn way too much money- missions or levels with a learning curve (the game is too straightforward)- better notifications of what is happening or how long people are queuing- construction is too long, not sure what is the point of that part but kinda realistic.A few improvements for the playability of the game recently but still a lot of work to be done.The developper seems to be productive.So, I wish the developper best of luck for finishing this game, I will definitely play that again but it's WAY too early now.See you in a few months or years"

This game has potential but is too bug-ridden to be given a full thumbs up just yet.  The game needs to explain how things work better beyond the initial 30 second tutorial.. and urgently fix huge bugs like staff tending to stop dead indefinitely because they can't seem to be able to locate an empty toilet (even though there are 4 nearby in rooms set to 'WC' - etc stuff like that.. firing staff doesn't work either so trying to fix the problem that way is moot.  The game is also a bit too slow to progress and there isnt enough gameplay or items to use/purchase/rooms etc to warrant the full price just yet... but one hopes there is yet far more to add in the near future.  The devs are apparently pretty good and listen to fans.The game should make it more obvious when things are working and you are doing things correctly.  It would be great if all members of the same profession werent the same gender and looked exactly the same - some variety here would make a great difference.It seems like all there is to the game at the moment is waiting to accumulate the money to purchase the new rooms and new equipment to do the same until shortly you have everything.  Hence gameplay seems lacking and unexciting.  Objectives need to be more varied and more curveballs thrown at the player.All this aside, the game gets a positive review for now because I think it has the potential to be the best hospital creator/management sim out to date if the developers get on top of the bugs, add more gameplay, variety and excitement to the game!

The problem comes with bugs and balancing that is a bit of a game breaker.Right now there is only 2 skins of the patients. 1 Male skin and 1 female skin. A variety of characters would be nice to see as well as more medical issues to diagnose. It's a bit too much of the same.There is also no way to take out loans, so when you first start out a lot of patients require surgery or diagnosis from equipment you cannot afford any time soon. The game should progress as you move forward instead of giving you heart attack patients and appendicitis patients right off the bat that you can't even provide proper treatement.The only way I can seem to solve this issue at this point is telling a patient, ""you have appendicitis"" and then proceed discharge them like an a****leThankfully the game has an autosave. Sometimes the AI just doesn't move or they get stuck inside the walls. But usually loading an autosave or just saving and reloading will get them moving.The last thing I'd like to mention is the game is riddled with spelling errors. A mild concern and not game breaking but annoying non the less.This is the type of game I have been looking for, it just needs a lot of work and polish but it has potential. But at this point it's only worth the price tag in an effort to support future developement."

Then all my saved files vanished. It's really not worth it for the money paid.Staff and guests get stuck doing nothing. No matter what I try this happens in each game. Refund requested.

In Hospitalize you have to manage a hospital and make sure you make profit. In order to make sure the hospital is running smoothly you need to look at the pasients need but also make sure you have enough staff to handle the workload.  Decoration and a clean hospital is also important. While playing you can choose what kind of management aspect you want to focus on...You have different layers of management, you can choose to take the role of your doctors and make sure the pasient are getting the best possible treatment or your staff/- docs are doing the pasient manageing work. What you always have to do is making sure the hospital have what it need, expand the hospital in order to manage the workflow will be one of many thing you`ll meet in this game. However, since this is an early access game you will find bugs.  the developer updates the game every 1-2 weeks.For management game-friends i can recommend this game."

I can barely play for an hour and then everything stops again. the only feedback from the game at this time is ""Person XY cant reach their target"". But even with enough freespace, checking for hallways, doors and much more this always happen. i cant recommend the game at this state anymore, sadly...Update on January 2017;Yes, it was updated with good updates but the bug that stops people working isnt fixed. It doesnt make any fun when after a few ingame hours your hospital can be closed. Only recommended when you have patience.--------------------------I like the realism. This is a part who has missed in Theme Hospital for me.Hospitalize has already a good base and can build up on this.Yes, there are bugs at the moment. Yes, it lacks in longterm gameplay.But it is Early Access and the Developer is active in the forum.I think this game can be something pleasant and content-rich in the future.And i will update this review from time to time to represent the current gamestate."

76561198181661581,Recommended,503370,35316259,Posted: 29 September,all,Pico 22,"I finished the game (only for now, I hope), meaning that no further advancement is possible and I also have a few rooms (research laboratory, emergency, mortuary) that are not used by anybody.I encountered no bugs worth mentioning, but I had another probkem. This is basically a game that plays itself; most of the time you just sit there and wait for the prescribed number of procedures (examinations, operations) to happen. You can speed things up, of course, but here the realism (the game is obviously being made by people who have good understanding of medicine and hospital procedures) comes in: some things you can do are just plainly wrong and it's clear you should not do them. Except when you totally loose patience, which I did a few times, I am afraid.Basically, this is a decent hospital primer but not such a great game. After emergency, etc., will be activated, things will probably change and a much needed urgency and suspense will be added - hopefully, along with some (the more the better) badly needed graphs.So, I can recommend the game  (though certainly not to the shooter crowd) but so far, I can't give it more than 7/10."
