,Recommended,503400,33316237,Posted: 6 July,all,♣ Coraline Castell ♣,"Four Last Things is one of those games that when I glanced at I thought ""aha! Finally someone has made a game for ME."" I'm awfully fond of Hieronymus Bosch, Monty Python, Point & Clicks, medieval anythings, classical music and sinning. It still seems absurd to me that someone tied all these things together and made it into a game! The sheer absurdity of the mere concept of it should be enough to stop anyone from trying. And yet, here we are.I guess most of Four Last Thing's merit comes, in my view, from simply existing. The rest of its merit comes from the fact that I love all of the core things which make it up.Writing reviews based off of recommending or not can be though in situations like these, because this game is far too short for most people I know to spend a penny with and I only love it so much because I love theideaof it. But how many others will find the concept as attractive as me? How many will be able to ignore its briefness in favor of its artistic value? It's difficult to answer.In ShortI do recommend Four Last Things, but only if you are overall attracted to the majority of elements that form it. Otherwise, get it with a discount. Above of all, if a game being short is a huge issue to you or if you hold ""money to playtime ratio"" as one of your sacred beliefs, don't buy it. It'll be over before you can answer what is the capital of Assyria."
76561197970623833,Recommended,503400,30122189,Posted: 23 February,all,The G Man,"I discovered this game when I met the developer at the PC Gamer Weekender in February 2017. I was immediately taken with the renaissance artwork and minimal interface on display. More so, I was impressed that this game was designed and created, from the ground up, by a single developer. He clearly had a passion for Point and Click adventure games and, having been raised on games like Monkey Island, Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (basically anything by LucasArts), I was keen to try the game.I played the game for about 30 minutes and, while this is not enough to give a full review on the day it is released, it gave me enough information to help you, the steam community, decide if you want to purchase the game. Firstly, you will love the graphical style. As soon as you see your character walk in the opening scene, you will smile and maybe chuckle. This is a game with a sense of humour and this was a theme throughout my play through.The writing / story is what makes a point and click adventure game, and in this respect, it does not disappoint. I will not spoil the story - I feel it is up to you to discover it and it will be a sin for me to divulge - but I will say this: I enjoyed it immensely.The game itself is not long. Speaking to the developer, it will take anywhere from 2 to 6 hours to complete, depending on your point and click experience. However, this is not a bad length for this type of game. Some adventure games wear out their welcome. This one does not.The lowdown is this, exceptional visual style combined with good writing and a nice audio track makes this little gem a must buy. Also, you get to commit the seven deadly sins. Sin away..."
,Recommended,503400,31872903,Posted: 20 May,all,nerdfury,"A point and click adventure game, set in medieval times, and has dry/somewhat dark humor? A trifecta of things that interest me? IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?I can’t say enough good things about the gameplay of Four Last Things. The puzzles are just the right difficulty (tricky and requires some thinking outside of the box, although not frustratingly difficult and illogical), the dialogue and commentary by the protagonist is exceptional, and the classical music soundtrack was a delight to listen to.One annoyance that I would like the creator, Joe Richardson, to consider for his future games: the game only saves if you perform certain actions. There is no auto-save. This is annoying if you have added some items to your inventory, but then have to log off (due to real life stuff). As I didn’t perform a “milestone” action, none of my recent progress has saved, so next time I have to go back and collect those inventory items again.I generally follow a cost efficiency rule where I want to get at least 1 hour of gameplay for every dollar I spend. Obviously, this didn’t happen here (2 hours for $7.99), but that’s quite alright, as Four Last Things is a gem of a point and click adventure game. A tiny gem, yes, but still a gem."
,Recommended,503400,35020713,Posted: 17 September,all,IFIYGD,"First things first- this game is NOT for everyone.You will either ""get it"" and enjoy it, or you won't.Personal Rating: 10/10This is what it was for me.Your Mileage May Vary. Widely.(For those who are easily triggered by religious references, and having religion poked fun at... you can stop now, and just walk away from the Store page. This game pokes fun at religious beliefs and practices. Big time. And I LOVE the dev for it!)No list of Pros and Cons this time. I am just going to try and give a *hopefully* brief description of the game and why it was so good for me. I did say *hopefully*. Remember that later...The art is fantastic. You are playing in a wonderfully weird amalgamation of paintings done by the Dutch Masters during the Renaissance period. Many images from one painting added to another, with somne subtle, and some not-so-subtle changes to the snippets. Weird. Wonderful. Artfully done.The animation style and much of the humor is very Pythonesque. Not so much the movies (although I seemed to notice nods to The Life Of Brian and The Holy Grail... but that could just be my imagination and obsession with Monty Python...), but more the feel and look of the old Monty Python's Flying Circus.Much Meta. Old style dialogues with modern, overly meta thrown in. Again, weird. Wonderful. As tastefully done as possible. Without being prudish. No other way to describe it for me.The puzzles were clever. Who and what you needed to interact with, in what order, and in what time. Yes, you need to use your brain. None were terribly difficult to figure out, but some took more time than others. A few were wonderfully simple and silly. So simple it was too easy to overthink how to work it out. Which made me chuckle. Going through a very difficult time in my real life right now, and having a game that is very clever and intelligent, with silliness and simplicity mixed in, and all sorts of philosophical and existential ""standards"" being poked fun at... I needed this.My experience with this game. I adore it. It was just what I needed to lift some very dark clouds. But for those looking for ""deep"" gameplay, quick and easy puzzles and achievements, or handholding and brainless completion... move along. This won't be for you. The 4.5 hours of gameplay shown at the time of this review was ALL gameplay, no idling for Trading Cards, no artificial inflation of time played. But... I walked through the game, I did not run. I allowed myself to explore all interactions I could, and look at every little detail I could. And I know I missed some. So I will play it again. Just to see what I may have missed.Thank you Joe Richardson! You did a good thing here, and made this middle aged lady smile. Big. :)"

(punchline after a brief review!)Utterly silly, splendid little adventure game.Lovely animated renaissance art (such as works of Italian Guy and Jan van der Person), classical music soundtrack by... ""The Who"", I guess?The pointing'n'clicking itself is fairly easy, full playthrough took me about two hours. But then, I'm a genius, so it'll probably be around nine years for an average person.The plot, without spoiling anything, revolves around seven deadly sins that you'll have to commit (it's probably still faster to commit them in real life, so if you're just here for the sinning, go outside and sin away! Off you go, then!).Overall, a joyous experience for connoisseurs of fine nonsense, well worth the price....and now, lo and behold,the punchline:alright, I bluffed, I don't have the punchline ready!

76561198067683541,Recommended,503400,30124878,Posted: 23 February,all,koneda_64,"A short, but sweet point and click adventure where you take on the role of a sinner, forced to repeat his sins for absolution. The first thing I should mention is the clever use of art throughout the game. Every scene is a piece of renaissance art brought to life in a crude but very humorous way with some laugh-out-loud moments. The characters are vulgar but very funny with their dialogue and the game as a whole doesn't take itself too seriously at all. I'd reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys point-and-click adventures and wants a short, mild challenge with lots of comic relief.8/10"

My biggest complaint is how short it is. 1.5 hours of gameplay for 7.99 feels fairly disproportionate. It was also a tiny bit buggy, I had to restart the game a couple times because I lost the ability to click on things & move areas but I assume that'll be fixed soon."

,Recommended,503400,34092581,Posted: 7 August,all,Kain Klarden,"Four Last Things is an amazing, but very short, point and click adventure game, built almost exclusively out of the renaissance art pieces. It's reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's art-based animations in Monty Python productions, but at the same time feels completely unique in it's approach. It is also a very silly, but engrossing little tale of a person who wanted to confess his sins, but couldn't due to the church bureaucracy. So now he has to do all 7 again to get a chance to confess them.And it's a truly great game, which reminded me a lot of the great Monty Python & the Quest for the Holy Grail from 7th Level, a usually forgotten silly little point and click adventure game based on the movie. Except, if that old game was often (intentionally) frustrating and annoying with its mini-games and puzzles, Four Last Things plays like a straight and really well made point and click adventure from start to finish. There's only one puzzle that is a bit obscure and one intractable object that is a bit less obvious, than it could be. Especially if you're playing on a bigger than 1080p monitor, since the game doesn't work that nicely on them, sadly, due to the engine choice. But damn, this game is very much worth the time and I cannot recommend it enough."

I'm a sucker for the cinquecento art while there was also that stoned painter Jeroen Bosch in the far north; my favourite era. The guy who made the game has a stronge aesthetic appreciation for that precise era combined with cleverness and my kind of humour. Off course I wasn't clever enough to figure it out myself but well. Never bought a game that endured roughly for three hours and thought it was worth every penny /eurocent."

It really benefits from super-high-res scans of the artworks, it just looks gorgeous on the big screen. The music selection fits perfectly. Of course, a voice track would have really brought out the humour but it's understandable that that's hard to achieve on a small budget. Loved this and I'm hoping for a sequel!"

It's a point and click adventure game with a pretty unique style, and it was nice to play something a bit different from the norm.It's probably not for everyone though:- For one thing it's fairly short - you'll likely do everything there is to do comfortably within two hours.- There's no voiced dialogue, but the ambient classical music in every area is really soothing.- If you leave a controller plugged into your pc on your desk you may get a surprise in the opening scene."

76561198027023164,Recommended,503400,30186590,Posted: 25 February,all,Golden Odium,"I beat the game in 2 hours, but that can be done faster if you follow some rules (mild spoilers below):1. A lot of the characters are just distractions. Just ignore every muscian and dancer, except the one next to the metal-smith, and don't bother talking or interacting with anyone in the art room. Also, the sinners outside of the church have no involvement with the puzzles. Finally, the smoking guy contributes nothing but conversation, and the cheering people by the statue do nothing at all. Oh, and the fishermen contribute nothing, as do the street-fighters.2. There's an open area situated high in the sky, in which you can't do anything, so don't bother visiting it twice. This game does not drop any new items or characters into places as the story progresses, so basically, if it's empty once then it's empty forever.3. One quest involves solving a riddle. The trick is that this one isn't really a riddle--that is, the phrases should be treated literally and not figuratively.4. Some of the quests involve paying attention to the art and elements of the background. So, if you're trying to be creative about solving a puzzle but you keep being told that your permutations are not allowable, then you have to find an in-game analogue to make your design choices.5. Some items are hard to notice, especially since they don't look any different from the rest of the background textures. Here's some important locations:---A jug by the landowners.---A hammer and chisle at the lower right-hand corner of the town center.---A musical instrument on the windowsill of the cheering family's house.---A fish by the fishermen. Although I'm not sure if that was ever used for anything.If you want to get all of the achievements, then remember these rules:1. Drink booze.2. Give the poor man near the end everything of value. Even fish and pie, if you are carrying them.3. Do something involving art. I think that you have to analyze a particular painting.Otherwise, I think that the achievements can be obtained via normal story progression.Ultimately, I love it. The art style is amazing and employed in startlingly creative ways. I was chuckling because of the humor throughout. And it could be easily solved without a walkthrough; it's not like the game world is huge, even if you count all of the extraneous characters, so wandering back and forth aimlessly will eventually yield progression in short time."

Second thing: I have to play this!After playing for a little while now, I don't think about Monty Python anymore, but am astounded to have stumbled across such a brillant gem!The artwork is one of the greatest I've ever experienced in a point-and-click-adventure. The humour is one of its own kind and so is the gameplay; of course you have to solve some riddles, but something that happens only in the best games, you loose yourself completely in the setting, in the dialogues etc. You want to solve the riddles, but also you just want to play and discover places, go through all possibilites.So, if the art of the trailer gets through to you, try it, cause the game is much, much better!Sadly, it's very short; but nonetheless more fun and more worth the money than many games I've played over the last months.

There are several locations but you can visit them all right at the beginning, which means you wander around looking for possible things to do, then you wander around remembering what you had seen, then you wander around looking for the objects you miss and then you wander around to tie the loose ends. But there are no new characters or locations. In the beginning it feels like too much, in the end like too little.The locations are great and very vivid, but they've not been put to good use. There are very little people or objects to interact with in each location, the dialogues are great but short and there are very few new dialogue lines available with progression. Also it was way too short, concidering the pricing of other indie adventures.Still! The uniqueness of it all and the wacky humour made the ride very enjoyable."
