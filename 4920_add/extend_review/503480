,Recommended,503480,24411732,"Posted: 19 July, 2016",all,Cohen The Barbarian,"A neat platform game from a Turkish developer.PROS+ Animations: Most of the time they're fluid and easy on the eye.+ Sound design: Nothing superb is there, but it sounds cool enough. Theres no annoyance on sound assets or melody loops.+ Fun factor: Follows in the footsteps of classic Amiga-C64-Nintendo platform gaming.+ Controls: Controls are all set.+ Cheap.Neutral+ Gfx: Even its easy on the eye, still looks uninspired at parts. While playing a huge feeling covers the player that: theres room for more improvement.+ Play value: Its out of your system after playing it for 3 hours max. But this is not a bad thing. Not everyone have massive amounts of time to spend on gaming and not every game has to be 24+ hours long.Cons+ Story: Monomythical, simple, hero vs villain story. No engagement for modern fiction there. Even using Turkish words like ""Mahluk"" or ""Kindar"" is not making it any more exotic. (Btw what the hell developer was thinking pronouncing Turkish words falsely, like trying to read it if its in English? Just read it as it should sound :) )+ Some minor technical issues: At 1920x1080 fullscreen resolution mouse pointer is a bit out of place.+ No rebinding to keys.Price/fun/gaming-time and quality are all relevant and in place. Fun for few hours, if you feel like playing a platform game reminiscent of its retro classics, give it a shot.7.5/10"

Remember the charmingly bare-bones mechanics, the simple-yet-enjoyable gameplay, the relentless side-scrolling from left to right, with just a wee bit of up and down? Yep, he fondly remembers all that too!Remember the way that you only had so many ""lives"", and if you died, you went all the way back to the beginning of a level? Remember the punishing difficulty, from practically the word ""go"", where you have that one tricky jump which takes two minutes to get back to, even if you're starting to speed-run the ♥♥♥♥ing level and ignore all the juicy collectables along the way, just so you can get back and try/die in that one spot yet, yet, yet again?! Yup. The developer of Mahluk: Dark Demon remembers that like it was only yesterday. Shame he had to be such an unforgiving♥♥♥♥♥♥and follow that old-school formula to the absolute ♥♥♥♥ing letter.Since the advent of semi-frequent checkpoints and permanent saves, I really don't need games to be this unforgiving any more. If I want unforgiving, I can get a job, or receive marks back from my university lecturers. I still want games to be a teeny, tiny bit of FUN, goshdarnit. And doing the same few minutes of a level over and over and over again is no longer my idea of fun. It ain't the 80s any more.Trust me, there's a lot of recent gaming trends which I dislike as much as anyone - hell, seemingly more than just about EVERYONE - like ""open world"" games where you grind for eighty hours and buy houses to put ""wives"" into and pick up and buy and sell stuff 'til the friggin' cows come home. And I don't mind the odd bit of primitive graphics, sound and gameplay as a bit of an antidote to the mega-uber production values we're all so accustomed to these days. But the ""spirit"" of old-school gaming doesn't need to mean implementing every single limitation of those old games which I thought we'd gratefully left behind DECADES ago. Give me a sword-and-sorcery version of Limbo any day.I'm certainly not going to give this game a thumbs-down, as it has a nice sense of ""style"" and certainly does what it sets out to achieve. And what it sets out to achieve is admirable enough, it's just sadly not quite my ""thing"". Maybe it'll be YOUR thing?I think I've told you all you need to know. Suffice it to say, only stubbornly stone-age era (aka ""hardcore"") gamers need apply. Wusses like yours truly should probably just stick to games which - while they don't necessarily ""hold our hands"" - at least give us a leg-up every once in a while.Serkan Bakar, you are one truly ruthless mother-♥♥♥♥er. Congrats on the game, one way or another.Verdict: 6.5/10.(PS ""Our old retro style addicting game will be now one of your top favorite free adventure games."" Last time I checked, $1.19 USD on sale wasn't anyone's definition of ""free"". You may want to remove this from the Store page description before the ♥♥♥♥♥ing hordes come out to play in the forums, my friend, hahaha...)"
,Recommended,503480,24423825,"Posted: 20 July, 2016",all,Vasehead,"It's an okay game for a low price.The art direction is interesting and I like the pixelated style.The gameplay is a bit basic with up, down, and side-to-side movement as well as attack and interact.Story, as far as I'm concerned is a kind of throw-away since you're only given a basic view on what happened in that world and the character who you're playing as; a nameless warrior amongst anguish who is in search of retribution.Overall, it's worth the shot if you're into this type of game and style. And for the current price of 95p, can't really go wrong c:"

76561197970281251,Not Recommended,503480,24420012,"Posted: 19 July, 2016",all,jmzero,"Game looks OK and controls alright, but difficulty is wildly variant.  The enemies tend to be trivial, but the game has awkward jumping sections where you get to contend with fiddly hit-boxes, jerky platform motion, and instakill spikey bits.  The game doesn't follow normal platform game conventions for visuals - so while the elements are all plain-old platformer things, you're often surprised by how things behave.  That was a disappearing platform?  Really?  I've played tons of platformers, and most follow visual conventions to tell things to players while still keeping a unique style.  Eg. I just played ""You have to win"", and while it's a tough game, it quickly communicated to me what I needed to know to play.And it's not just visual, it's ""gameplay contract"" stuff.  Sometimes you have to blind jump.  Sometimes blind jumps kill you.  The enemies move erratically, like the frogs don't finish their jumps they just kind of come down when they want.  Sometimes something is a functional graphic, sometimes it's just background (ie. you won't know what ""spikey stuff"" will kill you until it kills you).Most frustrating is that it has a ""lives"" mechanic - so you can restart from a level checkpoint until you're out of lives.  I understand this is how games used to work, but there's a reason games don't work this way anymore - it's frustrating and boring.  It's not like the game is trying to get my quarters or something;  all this does is encourage the player to kill themselves until ""game over"" if they're at the start of the level with men down - because you don't want to work your way to a checkpoint if you've only got one guy left.  Suiciding is boring.Also, the power ups are lame (and, again, feel irrelevant since the challenges in the game seem to be mostly environment).  Like, the ice projectile thing freezes an enemy, but you can't go hit it while it's frozen.  That's lame.  There's no joy to the combat.  You don't feel like you're chopping at dark demon monsters, you're just kind of waving your sword hitbox around and dealing damage.Anyway, enough complaints.  The game seems to basically work, and I'm sure most players will get their $1 worth of entertainment here.  But I thought I'd give some feedback that's hopefully helpful either to the developer or potential players."

The enemies are inconsequential, the hard part of the game is the platforming.  It's listed as ""retro style addicting gameplay"", but I found the gameplay to have the opposite effect.  It wasn't addicting at all, it just made me quit after falling down the same pits a few times in a row due to the limited controls.  I like the artistic style, so I wanted to like this game.  Came back to try to play it a few more times and just gave up on it.  There's really nothing there to grab your interest and keep pushing forward.  I suppose you get what you pay for."

Not even mildly entertaining."
,Recommended,503480,24417283,"Posted: 19 July, 2016",all,Jowie,This game is actually pretty good. I bought it because it was cheap and I'm poor. However I would definitely pay more for this game. Just beware that this is pretty challenging.
,Recommended,503480,24414419,"Posted: 19 July, 2016",all,wshand,"Mahluk is a surprising platformer, especially considering it's price point. A diverse set of levels and enemies populate this game, in it you will find many shadowy creatures to destroy. The levels are well designed and present a fair but fun challenge. Be careful so you can get your revenge against that evil god dude.Overall 10/10 would buy again! <3 :D <3"

76561198173606567,Recommended,503480,25963465,"Posted: 10 October, 2016",all,KeinSchiesse,"Simple 2D platformer with good, chunky pixelated graphics and varied enough gameplay and platforming so as to remain fresh. Not simply another ""Limbo"" / Silhouette knockoff, it leans more toward something resembling a medieval, creepy, Tim Burton / Alice-In-Wonderland esque setting. The gameplay is simple but you also have a double-jump, spells to throw, and a basic attack. Haven't played enough to know much whether there are bosses or not. Not many cutscenes at all. Straight forward and to the point but well-made."

The visual and musical themes of the game are also done quite well. If you likew dark/gothic themed action platformers you will be at home with this one. Of course the most important aspect of any action-platformer game is the control and this one delivers with tight, simple controls.Only one issue really:The store page describes the game as having FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT. At this time it does not. Not a big deal since all of the gameplay controls are available on the controller except for ""switch weapon"" which is bound to the keyboard with no menu option to bind it to a controller button. Also, the only way to access the in game pause menu is by pressing ESC on the keyboard as the START and SELECT buttons (XBOX 360 controller) have no functionality in the game at all. So just be warned that the store page is not accurate in this regard."
76561198244451710,Recommended,503480,24511009,"Posted: 24 July, 2016",all,ThunderClap220,This is a great retro style platformer. Some of the jumping and crouching mechanics are hit or miss and feel a bit clunky. The story is meh (but who is going to play it for the narrative?). Soundtrack is pretty good though it does loop.The art is also really nice.All in all a great little game that I have enjoyed plus its dirt cheap.
,Recommended,503480,28999535,Posted: 3 January,all,Arecyn,"I bought the steam version, after i finished the game on Android. As a platformer that immitate their 80s-90s forefathers, it has a little bit story that adds some depth to the game and sense to the action. Even if the existence of a story isn't a big thing for the genre, it is a significant pro for some old timers like me. The art direction has some flaws. Difficulty curve often feels like it's random. But the game has all the familiar features of 80's best seller platformers. The pixel art and animation quality is also not bad. Mahluk is a very good game for its price."

,Recommended,503480,30905941,Posted: 2 April,all,Undead,"Got this on sale 50% off so $1.00. When i typed this up I had 3 hours in the game and only 2 levels left. I so far have played this game at $0.34 an hour ($0.65 at full game price).Pros+Decent Platforming for the most part, some of the later levels had jumps that where a tad annoying (A ceiling above you that would cause you to easily mess up a jump and fall to your death)+Rather easy combat, some enemies can be more challenging but most die in 1 to 2 hits with the normal sword.+I enjoyed the art style.+I quite enjoyed the soundtrack.Neutral~Has a few upgrades, the health one seems like the best value as it adds 2 health.~You get a double jump but only if you jumped yourself, you only get one jump if you fall off a ledge.~Short game (This is in the neutral category because it's a very cheap game.)Cons-Boss's seemd very easy.-Some very precise jumps-Terrible use of waypoints. Best example being one level was extremely easy start then you hit the waypoint and its just a gauntlent of hard jumps and enemies places in spots to specifically cause you to lose health.-Inconsistent terrain damage. My favourite here is the rolling rocks, no matter where you touch them they where an instant death (even if you jumped and landed on top). Various spikes would be instant deaths or a tick of health. I did notice that it was more wall/ceiling spikes where instant death and ground where just ticks of health, regarldess was a bit frustrating.-The volume options didn't work in game.Overall I feel like this game was enjoyable and would reccomend giving it a go."

They can be configure in a screen before opening the game, and in another one in the game. Both are incomplete (no ""Revert to default button""???), and they're not even working together. As a result, they're doing everything except what I want to in the menus and while I play the game. I wrote to support, they replied they've tested three controllers, nothing else that could help. I replied and I never heard about them since then. It's a pity, 'cause I really wanted to finish this game. Now, I'm just going to uninstall it and forget about it."
