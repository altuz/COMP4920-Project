,Recommended,503580,35007983,Posted: 16 September,all,Xzanos,"OverviewI was initially having trouble pinpointing what this game actually is? What do you do in it? Plenty of things are shown in the trailer but I left the trailer feeling very confused.So here's the large and short of it. The main meat of the game is a video game that you play as a 1980's kid called ""Duck Season"". This game puts you into the VR play space of the classic game ""Duck Hunt"".You shoot ducks out of the sky with a rifle and a silly dog collects them and dances around. The quality of everything in this game, and I cannot emphasize this enough, is amazing. The ""Duck Season"" game itself is large amounts of fun despite being so simple. This game also has a rather dark storyline that happens in between successful ""Duck Season"" play sessions. Every time you jump into the game, time advances and the story progresses a little farther but I'll get to that later. All this being said it is something that might be best for people who show VR off a lot. There is some replay value but for 20$ you're getting something that can be completed in about an hour.Duck Season ItselfAs mentioned previously the meat of this game is the ""Duck Season"" game within the actual game. Starting this game up literally inserts you into the TV where you shoot at ducks for points. You gain more points the more ducks you hit in a row. The shooting feels nice and does something that I've yet to see any game, VR or not, do. This is to say that your ammunition is visible as an outline when you look at your gun, it visually shows you how much ammo you have by outlining the shells in your gun which I absolutely adore as a way to show ammo in VR. When you shoot you have to pump to ready another shell and eventually grab ammo to put into your gun, again all of this feels great.My main criticism is to say that beyond shooting at some ducks there isn't much more to the ""Duck Season"" game. I don't think there really is anything they could have added but if this is the meat of the game then I'm a bit disappointed. I have plenty of shooting sims already in my library and I'm conflicted as to whether or not I'd actually come back to this one over others. It's as if I've ordered the best ribs I've ever had and I get one solid bite before I'm done. Still, I have to say the quality here is without question one of, if not thee, best vr experiences I've had!The Rest of the GameOutside of Duck Season itself you play as a 7-9 year old boy who is spending a summer evening in front of the telly. The game takes place over several in game hours. As you play Duck Season, VHS's, video games, toys, magazines and snacks will pile up around you. It can be kind of fun to screw around in front of the television with all this stuff. I personally made it a game to see how many things I could chuck at my mom in the kitchen before she might take notice to her son.After the succulent hit her in the eye, and she didn't react, I gave up.The other ""Kingbit system's"" games are all played with a virtual controller gun. You shoot at the options on the TV to pick them and none stood out as something I'd do more than once. Some are pretty silly even just as a title but it's pretty clear that they aren't meant to be done more than once or twice.The VHS's you find are mostly meme's of one sort or another and all fit into the 1980's theme rather well. Some of these look to have been made just for this game and none of them are short on entertainment. My friends and I got a really good laugh at a few that were up and even recognized some old youtube videos that were neat to see in game.All in all there isn't a whole bunch to do here, just some fiddling around in between ""Duck Season"" sessions.The Story and WorldSpoiler FreeThe story is quite simple and short once you see and understand it but holds several surprises that I don't want to spoil. Bottom line, was it enjoyable? Yes! It quite certainly is. The 1980's atmosphere set up is great and the game had me looking over my shoulder nervously multiple times. Each session of ""Duck Season."" Advances time outside of the game by an hour. Around 4 o'clock, odd things start happening. It's no secret if you look at any of the trailers or tags but this is in fact classified as a horror game. Much to my own delight though it at no point says or lets that fact on. So if you have friends that come over to play VR, or maybe family, you could just throw them in and see how they react.It's not a terribly long story and we were able to finish it in about 1 hour although there was a lot of screwing around and we also had to retry one of the ""Duck Season"" sessions once as well as retrying the ending. Speaking of the ending there are seven of them. I've found two, the sort of ""bad ending"" and the ""canonical ending"". I scratch my head as to how you might be able to get the other 5 though. I'm sure some replay value can be found there as well as the ""New Game+"" option that opened up but that I did not try.VerdictA clear work of love this game shines but not for long enough. 1 Hour of gameplay for 20$ just isn't what I want for my money""Duck Season"" is one of the highest quality VR experiences that you'll find. It lacks quantity, variety and length but makes up for it all with the sheer amount of love put into each idea and piece of the game. The game is by and large shooting at ducks but it breaks this up often enough that it doesn't become monotonous. I think after the first playthrough you'll probably want to stop but I can't tell you how much fun that short experience is. I've said it previously and it's kind of my verdict here but I recommend this game for a sale. If you think people will play again or if you're dying for a ""shooting at things simulator"" then I can certainly understand a desire to buy it. That being said I wouldn't recommend a let's play if you're bound to pick this up at some point. The surprises just wouldn't be the same without VR there.Based on a score from -5 to 5a 0 is ""okay"" or ""non noticeable""a 3 is ""quite good""a -3 is ""quite bad""CategoryScoreGraphics3Gameplay4Story3Music1Sound2Replayability-2Legnth1 HourBuyWait for SaleWatchAvoidNever Touch"

It does have some replayability but not a massive amount, at least for me.  I am a massive wuss when it comes to horror in VR and found parts of the game scary, others I have no doubt will consider it very PG.Would be a no brainer at $10 if you find it in the sale in the future, $20 is fair for the quality and effort put into making this game although its abit on the high side for how much I feel I will get out of itUltimately it was a fun and memorable experience, hence I recommend it"

It blows my mind that there is so much going on in what is, fundamentally, a pretty simple game.This is probably one of the few times VR's made me straighten up and go, 'That thing?

It really took me back to the 80s when I played on my NES until late at night, and then had to fight for my life as the Duck Hunt dog tried to murder me. Those were truly the good old days. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants an immersive anf fun experience."
,Recommended,503580,34956333,Posted: 14 September,all,Bourgeoisie Bakewell,"Solid game, great performance, great graphics and really great gameplay! Intuitive shotgun controls, the best gun handling in any VR game to date! I've done one of the 7 endings and I'm hooked, only stopped because my controllers ran out of battery. The atmosphere is really well done."
,Recommended,503580,34988718,Posted: 15 September,all,DannyPikmin,"As someone who religiously avoids horror films and games (just watched my first horror flick, The Shining, the other day to hype myself up for this) and is even scared of the Minecraft mobs, this game is still absolutely worth experiencing the scares. Just the fact that this game dragged me in regardless should speak volumes.Pros:- Beautifully crafted environments all around. Attention to detail glows in this game, from the wonderfully constructed cartridges & game boxes to being able to steal your mother's sandwich and eat it while she stares at you. These little actions go a long way in VR- Homages to the 80's help to sell the time period- Aiming the gun feels consistently fair- Minigames and VHS's that unlock between rounds keep the game fresh. Minigames make good use of the lightgun system so you don't feel like you're- 7 different endings- Game plays at your own pace. It only progresses when you choose to- You can grab just about any grabbable object no matter the distance. Just reach out towards it and use the force to pull it to your hands. Game cartridges and VHS's can be thrown or tossed into their players if they're out of reach -- overall, the game is extremely friendly to users with small play spaces.Cons:- Compatability with Oculus Rift/AMD is a little sketchy. Constant crashing and artifacts at launch, but reaching out helped bring out a near perfect fix. Turned async and interleaved projections off and added ""-noaq"" as a launch option to the game - now it works as intended, but a few crashes still occur every now and then. Playable, but they're still there.- (SPOILER)Devs have stated that the dog only attacks you if you shoot him first. In my ""pacifist"" playthrough, I was still put through the horror segments when I absolutely least expected them. I did shoot the dog in a practice room, but I don't believe that should carry over to the main attraction. Possibly a bug.- (SPOILER)The solution to the big dog boss didn't feel like it was communicated well enough. It makes sense in hindsight, but in the heat of the moment I had no clue where to begin shooting until I accidentally found the weak spot. Could've sworn that area would be invulnerable- The shooting mechanics, as good as they may feel when you get used to using them, feel really awkward to use. Aiming is pivoted to your dominant hand as opposed to the hand on the pump, so in order to aim with both hands you need to lead with the hand closest to you as opposed to the other way around. It does force your hands to stay in the general areas they would be if you were really holding the shotgun, but it feels extremely unnatural.Overall, mostly due to the nature of the shotgun mechanics and how crashing still is a (slight) problem after troublehsooting, I believe this game deserves a strong 8/10. If the crashes are addressed in the future, make that a 9/10.I would like to thank the devs I talked to for being patient with me throughout the troubleshooting process. I usually don't reach out like this, but I'm glad I decided to this time.My specs:- AMD FX-6300 3.5 GHz- 16 GB DDR3 RAM- AMD RX 480 8 GB"

Ive only had a few hours last night, and already massively impressed. Just wanted to leave a recommendation before I start playing it again tonight.The aim is spot on. I've shot clay pigeons quite a bit over the years, and if you line up your controllers as if you had a real shotgun in your hands... its perfect sights. I've only used shotguns in other games a cpl of times, but they didn't feel natural, yet this one feels perfect.The graphics are lovely, feel well polished, and give a good sense of depth. The rest of the game... its superbly nostalgic! But it's creepy. And I mean really creepy. The devs got right what they set out to do. I've managed 2 endings after a cpl of fun filled, yet slightly disturbing hours, and im hoping to discover a cpl more tonight. With 7 endings, lots of mini games and easter eggs to find, there's a lot of replayability.Really recommend this game to all. Over the years as a gamer on all platforms, the times I've wasted £30-40 on games that were crap, I really couldnt count. So £15 for this seems totally justified, and money well spent."
,Recommended,503580,34958183,Posted: 14 September,all,CoolHandDuke,"This really blew me away. I saw a teaser trailer for it a week or two ago and thought it would be interesting, but I had no idea it would be like this. First and foremost the atmosphere is so well done. It totally looks like an 80s household. You can grab most things in the environment and interact with a lot of them. I accidentally found out that you can play other games on the TV and I found myself like a 9 year old sitting on my floor staring at this virtual TV playing spoof games. It was so endearing and fun. Also my family thinks I'm insane.The shooting game itself is very fun and satisfying. You could replay easily and enjoy it. Maybe try all the different difficulty settings. Graphics are really good as well and ran flawlessly with SS at 2.0.As for the horror aspect, it's definitely creepy in parts but not too bad. I was expecting a lot worse. However I don't really like horror games so I was pleased that they didn't go to overboard with jump scares and whatnot. As far as the mature rating, I think there's some questionable language on some of the VHS tapes (which you can also play) and some gore. I wouldn't let a kid play through the story.The story is pretty short, but can be replayed and enjoyed. Also would be fun to break out with a crowd.I finally got to shoot that dog..."
,Recommended,503580,34961252,Posted: 14 September,all,AirRaidMaterial,I've only played 38 minutes and I had to write a review.I'm an 80's baby and this game brought back some serious nostalgia. Being in the living room playing video games with my brothers on a CRT TV while mom is in the kitchen cooking. This game put me in that atmosphere again. What an amazing feeling. The environment in the living room and in the game is very very polished. Graphics are great.Everything about this game feels super retro. They captured this era very well.One of my favorite things about this game is the commercials that come on the TV. What a great touch. It's all the small things that really create great immersion and this game does it well.Well worth the $20.

Yes.It's an artpiece.It takes about 1 hour to make it to the end of the day and find ""a"" ending. It takes about 2-3 hours to unlock all 7 main endings. Replaying the shooting segments is literally the only low point of this title.It actually does take anywhere from 3-6 hours to explore the remaining bonus content and find the ""true"" ending. All of which is, frankly, a hell of a ride.I can't recommend the game enough. Grab it."

I got the Fiesta Ending, but since I was over near the table the entire game I can't tell you if you can play other games. Still, it was great fun shooting the ducks, and the annoying dog. And there is a mild horror factor as the day goes on, but nothing too intense. Not sure why it is rated mature. Shooting ducks?EDIT: Did a second playthrough, the more you shoot the dog, well, that dog has issues. I won't give away the ending, but yes, blood and violnce. And now I'm scared of the dog. Also, if you reset your position using Steam it fixes your in-game positioning."

Blowing on the cartridges, VHS tapes, juice boxes, toys!I'm a 28 yr old man who actually decided to sit down in this fake living room and play with the fake toys in front of me like I was a kid again hahahaha.The shooting mechanics were awesome. I really enjoyed firing the shotgun, a couple hiccups here and there with racking and reloading, but nothing that detracts from the game. The horror part of the game is TINY, I wouldn't warn anyone with a low tolerance of fear to stay away. Yeah, I really liked the game and I really recommend it for any 90's kids out there who want a huge nostalgia boost."
,Recommended,503580,35056909,Posted: 18 September,all,HotdogOctopus,TLDR : Decent but overpriced. Buy when it's on sale.A decent enough romp for a couple hours. A little overpriced even with all the secrets and such. Would be a little better if it was a rail shooter when you are 'in the game'. Needs more depth for the $20 price tag.
76561197988928976,Recommended,503580,34960109,Posted: 14 September,all,Hatecraft,"As of this review, I've only finished one of the seven endings, but this game is probably worth checking out at this price.  It's a limited experience, but it has enough charming, bizarre, and often funny touches that I think anybody who grew up in the late 70s through mid80s will love.  It's very Adult Swim in its approach and presentation, and it's done well enough that it feels well crafted rather than a cheap ripoff.I do wish the environment was more explorable.  It would be really interesting if you could explore the whole house instead of being bolted in front of your tv.  It's a small criticism though because a lot of what makes this game work is its singular focus on making sure your relationship to the dog is strange and scary.  Once the antagonist was established, even if I was sure I was safe, I felt uneasy about what was going to happen to me.To top it all off, the shooting gallery game feels pretty good.  Although, I did have some odd moments where my tracking (oculus 3-sensor setup mounted about 7.5 ft in the corners of my room) had difficulty sensing that I was trying to rack the shotgun.  While this portion of the game isn't the most unqiue, the stock stabilization mechanic does work well, and I hope to see similar implementations in future games featuring guns with stocks.I'm looking forward to playing through this game a few more times.  I'm a little worried that there's just not enough of the side content to keep me engaged long enough to see all the endings, but I suppose that's not such a big deal.  It's a fun, trippy, and well-crafted VR experience, and that alone makes it better than 70% of the VR stuff I've experienced so far.  If you don't mind that it's not a game in the tradtional sense then I highly recommend this game to you.  For most other people, I still think it's worth checking out if you have the money.  8.5/10 so far."

But the truth is the only thing I didnt like about it is that it seemed short... but is it actually short when it has several different endings?!? I finished it in about an hour but apparently there are several ending and obviously I only saw one. I am not sure if I will want to go back and play through it again to see a different ending. But I will probably watch friends/familly play and see the different endings.My One huge but small nit pick is that one of the things that I distinctively remember from the original duck hunt was the dog's laugh. I am disappointed that they did not include that simple detail. Or maybe I didnt miss enough targets for him to laugh at me?!?Bottom line is that this game is pretty much Duck Hunt in VR, nostalgic, creepy, unique, and slightly innovative."

It's the first time in awhile that I didn't even realize an hour had gone by in VR because everything just works well together. I'm a big baby when it comes to being spooked in VR games but the atmosphere is interesting and the mechanics are fun so I pushed through the first ending... and I couldn't wait to jump right back in and try something else to see another conclusion. My wife is also easily scared by (most anything) and she had a good time playing through once too! I'd also like to highlight the spot-on controls. Shooting the gun feels excellent.The price is good if you're interested in replaying the game to see multiple endings otherwise you will be happier waiting for a sale.

If you love innovative and unique experiences in VR, stop reading now and get this. You won't be disappointed.______________________This is a step in the right direction for VR. The future of VR is in its story-telling and its ability to transport you into another world. This may seem like ""Duck Hunt in VR"" but its a lot more. This is a rare kind of game where you actually want to rush through the gameplay to get to the next scene.Don't get me wrong. The duck hunt mini-game itself is pretty fun and gets pretty challenging, but Duck Season shines in its ability to make you feel something. Its somewhere in-between nostalgia and fear.Lots of little easter eggs here and there along with some other interesting/funny mini-game cartidges that are actually playable. Without giving away any spoilers, a single play-through lasted me an hour and I felt that hour was worth the price, given how refreshing it was. Even then, the game claims it was only one of seven endings.In the future, when VR is a lot more established we'll laugh at the idea of paying $20 for something this short, but right now, there's very little like it out there and compared to the other mediocre experiences I've spent money on, this justifies its cost."
,Recommended,503580,35034708,Posted: 17 September,all,Fenrisfil,"Played through once, took about an hour and I got the canon ending (one of seven possible). It's hard to judge value for money with VR games as they tend to be a lot shorter than standard games, but the value often comes in how well they use the VR environment both for atmosphere and playability. With that in mind:Atmosphere: This is where the game excells. From the 80s childhood home to, to the manifestation of the ""Duck Season"" game world to the awesomely creepy end game. All are excellent. The game even managed to come up with a great original way to tell the epilgoue/end credits. There seems to be no end of bonus content/Easter Eggs too. I haven't even played all the mini games or VHS tapes yet. Definite win.Interaction: This could be better to be honest. The ""Duck Season"" main game is a little awkward to control and I admit I resorted to Easy mode to save the hassle of reloading and re-arming the shotgun. Even then it felt awkward the way I had to hold and aim the shotgun. In the real world while there is a lot to interact with, most of it doesn't do anything. I couldn't for example find  away to eat the choclate bars or open the game boxes. Nothing major, but it seemed like a bit more interaction wouldn't have been difficult. It would also have been nice to have a game pad option for the mini games rather than playing them with the gun. Ultimately the only bit that I see as a problem is the awkward shotgun use.Content: VR Games don't tend to be content heavy and this isn't really an exceptions. You spend the vast majority of your time playing the core ""Duck Season"" game and while it is a very cool upgrade from the classic Duck Hunt game it does start to get boring a fair bit before the creepy stuff kicks in. Playing through seven times to achieve all endings is going to take about seven hours with about six hours of that just shooting at ducks. In the ""real"" world there are several videos and mini-games that you can play. The games are all pretty baisc and not sure I feel the need to ""Beat"" them all. The videos are fun though but don't require you to do anything but put them in the VHS. So on one hand there actually is a lot of hours worth of content here but on the other hand the really good stuff, the stuff you likely purchased the game for is about 70 minutes (10 per play through). Yes, you will have to shoot an awful lot of ducks.Bugs: After quitting and returning to the game I was hit with a bug that seemed to switch my left and right hands every time I switched between the ""real"" world and ""game"" world, so I constatly had to bring up the options menu to correct it.VR Rating System-------------------------Atmosphere = 5/5 - One of the best I've playedInteraction = 3/5 - Could be betterContent = 2/5 - Too much time is filled with just shooting ducksReplay = 2/5 - Love that there are seven endings, hate how many ducks you have to shoot to get to them!Total 3/5Overall I'd say this compares reasonably with other VR games in it's price range and is worth picking up now providing that like me you ultimately play VR for atmosphere more than anything else. If however you want something with greater playability or simply can't stand the idea of playing 45 minutes of Duck Hunt to get to the cool stuff then wait for a sale."

I played until I got to one of the endings, but I found it pretty easy and straight forawrd.You won't get that rush from dodging lasers in Space Pirates, or punching someone out in Thrill of the Fight, but you won't get tired as quickly either.I played this for under 2 hours and have had little inclination to play anymore as shooting the ducks out of the sky got a little boring, but I enjoyed having the dog as a sympathetic character."

Played through duck season just now, and I can say... its a pretty good game.Pretty good graphics for VR.Very interactive world.Interesting gameplay (for the most part)Potentially decent time/dollar.The game has a pretty interesting story line but the first ending can be achieved in around an hour.Once you beat the game, it tells you that you have unlocked 1/7 endings.You dont have to play the game through all the way to get the other endings, but I didnt bother doing more than one and got an hour play time out of it. For a game thats 20 dollars, its pretty good and has a decent amount of content.Theres only the story mode, really and there isnt much to explore, but if you want to get all 7 endings there could be some decent playtime here.My only gripe is that the main storyline is too short. I would say 15 minutes of it is interesting stuff and the other 45 min is regular old duck hunting. There are some cool mini-games you can play by interacting with the other snes cartridges but they simple, like you would expect a snes game to be. I'm sure there are a lot of hidden easter eggs and unlockable secrets in this game but its really not for me. I like a straight-forward game so I won't be playing this in the futer.TLDR;This game has 7 endings, the one I saw was pretty good. One hour playtime for first ending.This game is for you if you are into unlocking all the endings, not so much if you want something more straight-forward."

The Duck Hunt remake is very well done, but also very repetitive, and  you have to play it a lot if you want to discover the twists and the other elements of the experience.The thriller/horror twists disappointed me, because they are very short and anecdotic, there is not much gameplay around this (they are more like short and quite rare events).After seeing a first ending (and getting spoiled a few others), I didn't really wanted to go through other hours of tedious duck shooting to unlock and discover other endings.The shooting sessions are quite long and not very interesting past the 10 first rounds (left alone 100 rounds), and after a first full playthrough, Easter eggs and achievements were not enough for me to justify going on playing Duck Hunt in VR for hours, there already are a few 5 bucks games offering this experience.Same for the nostalgic effect, although I played Duck Hunt at its time at the age of the protagonist, and probably got the same haircut, I didn't felt like having to grind the same Duck Shooting game again with no variation just to discover a new 10 second clip, minigame or event.I would have paid 60-70 Schmeckles for the same game with real horror/thriller gameplay mechanics, where I could roam the house being chased by the dog, with more 80's Zapper VR remakes than Duck Hunt (like Wild Gunman or Bayou Billy), where the angry dog would also chase you,but for 20 Schmeckles, I didn't really had that much fun on this one, and at some times grinding Duck Hunt became more of a pain than a pleasure.It's cool this games exists, though, but I feel it would be more fun speaking about it than actually playing it.And that's why I feel this game is more like art than a game."

The duck game was not that bad, but I got bored with it, didn't have much time anyway and quit the game.  Afterwards, I wasn't so sure about buying this game.But today I've played it for an hour or so and I finished (the first ending) including checking out the mini-games, magazines, toy, etc, and I love this game!!!  Nevertheless, I still think it's not cheap, but maybe more content will be added at some point? Magazines/comicss you can actually read would be cool. Some more funny trailers and mini-games. More 80s toys.  But I can imagine the amount of work that goes into creating this, but.... it paid off...because this is an original and fun game with lots of atmosphere and you can find perfection in even the smallest details. The way the tv reflects the living room, how realistic the VHS videos look, how the light changes in the living room throughout the day, the different sounds when you hit a box or a vhs tape... pretty awesome work guys!

After watching the trailers, reading the description, and other reviews, I thought I had a sense for what this would be.  And I suppose in some ways, that sense was correct.  What I didn't know it would be was, what feels like hours, of shooting the same two ducks in the same patterns over and over.After an agonizingly long time, which turns out just to be 4 rounds of shooting the same two ducks over and over, the game starts to drop you into its story, which is interesting, but you're quickly back to...oh yes...shooting the same two ducks again.The novelty was gone very quickly.There may be 7 endings, but holy hell, I don't wanna bore myself to death finding them.  If you want to shoot stuff in VR, there are a plethora of better games to do so.  If you want a bizarre and slightly twisted story line, there are games that deliver better without making you plod through underdeveloped levels of the same crap.Pros -A flashback to the past that is entertaining in small dosesMildly humorous videosCons -Incredibly repetative game play.  If you don't want to shoot two ducks over and over with little variation in their flight path, this is your game.The mildly humorous videos aren't worth the admission. I wondered why they just didn't make a youtube channel and spare us the 20 dollars.  I feel like this game is a wrapper to watch terrible videos.The controls can be very wonky at times.  Reaching out to grab a game cartridge results in grabbing a cup or a magazine from 5 feet away.  Not that it matters as grabbing is moot and you will be back to shooting the same two ducks over and over and over and over and over...Admittedly, I have not played through the whole game.  There may be something that makes this game worth the 20 bucks I feel I wasted on it, however, it's so tedious and uninteresting so far, that I really don't care if there is more.  I'd rather do anything else than play more of ""Shoot Two Ducks Over and Over Again Season""."

All you need is just shoot ducks again and again. After 7th level you need to sweat to kill waves of 4 ducks. But that is all. I like style of this game, graphics, atmosphere of 1980s when you could rent games for your NES. But if you don't inerested in completing all 7 endings and getting all achievements, you will get bored.There are lots stuff to take, eat and some classic style games you can play on your TV. You are literally play games while you are in the game. That's funny, but not for a long.

I would be lying when I say I was thrown right back to when I was a kid with the VHS tapes, Game Magazines, and action figures in the overworld. I sat there on the floor reading them and messing around for a good while. The small attention to detail is very well done and I find it to be very nice.The gameplay is quite simple, load the shotgun and shoot the ducks. It has a similar reload and firing system to other VR games, so it is easy to get use to. Only problem I had was seeing the reload shell, when I had a spent shell in the chamber. This did kind of mess me up a few times.As a person who is not a huge fan of horror VR game (Fear of breaking my headset if something makes me flip the hell out), I found this one not as difficult to play for some reason. There is some slight jumpscares, but nothing for someone who is a hardened horror video game veteran to handle. But if you cannot handle stuff like that then I would steer clear of this game.Overall, this game is by far my favorite VR game so far. Yes, it is another shooter VR game; but It has a good story. Something most VR games lack due to people trying to pust them out for easy cash. I look forward to beating the multiple endings this game has to offer and actually figuring out more of the storyline."

The weapon feels great unlike most shot-guns in VR. Plus, even if a little short the Battle Bros game alone is worth the money hehe.  It doesn't take itself too seriously while being a great experience at the same time.  I recommend it, plus it gets creepy if you want it."

Now be warned this ISN’T your remake of a classic, but a spin on the classic, meaning the game has shooting ducks, it is only a small portion of the game.   Another thing to mention is this game isn’t just meant to be played through.  It’s to be experienced, embrace your 80’s surroundings, the VHS tapes (these were how many watched movies before DVD’s and steaming).  The developers really put a lot of effort into making all the extra content you have into feeling like you were a kid in the 80’s.  The VHS videos alone were both ‘WTF’ moments and ‘MEH’ moments, but just like the collection I had as a kid, there were good ones and bad movies (those were from my parents).The way they start the game is very impressive, telling a story via stage props.  The overall artistic, you must give credit where it’s due.  This isn’t just a simple shooting game, but an artistic envision of the 80’s culture and how these games, just like today were just as addictive.PROS:Lots of content to exploreYou get to shoot ducksWell put together gameVHS videosAdditional games included (ah pizzaboy, or AKA paperboy).CONS:Although duck season you go get to shoot ducks, it is not very difficult.  Since this isn’t the main point of the game, still would have been nice to have a part where you can just play this (I know there is the practice), changing difficulties, number of ducks, etc.The one thing I would have loved was the dog making sounds, laughing at you if you missed, just like the original…That would have really brought it closer to what I remembered.Not Replay able.  I played it in portions, to really enjoy it.  I figured from the price point it wouldn’t be a long game.   I may play this again later, but more for just the shooting of the ducks.A little repetitive.OVERALL:If you are looking for a shooter game, like duck hunt, then this isn’t for you.  The developers took this classic and wrapped an interesting world around the game.   If you were a fan of that era, you will enjoy this game.  I more enjoyed the game when not playing Duck Season because there was so much more to explore.  For the price point, seriously people for $20, there is a lot of content for what you get, just not a lot of gameplay.  If it was $30, no it would not have been worth it since at the end this is a game."

The first 30 minutes of the playthrough are really repetative and only saved by the little nods to the 80s and the funny vhs tapes, but after those first few levels the game gets intreresting and once it ends you just want to go back and play again to see how the endings differ. My only main gripe is that the duck hunt part of the game is super repetative and gets old quick, and once the second half of the game kicks off you just wish the game was like that portion for the whole game as it is way more immersive and engaging. Try not to watch any playthroughs and just buy this game it is one of the most intriguing narrative games on vr as of right now."

I bought and almost immediately refunded Hover Junkers when It originally came out so I didn't go into this purchase very confident, but I do feel that for the most part the devs have delivered a genuinely enjoyable experience.  The visual quality it top notch but some things feel kind of weak, such as turning around to see a human boy through the tv poorly mimicking your movements.  Shooting ducks is repetitive but fun and could use a few more elements to keep it fun enough to want to peruse the alternate endings.  There needs to be a sticky grip option similar to Onward so I'm not stumbling around just trying keep a hold on my gun.  I'm also not a fan of Corridor Digital or really any youtubers and its clear the Devs are but that probably wont detract from your experience as it did for me.  Overall I'd say it's worth the buy."

This is really a game where you can sink in more time by exploring your surroundings more closely, trying to find out the puzzles and hints hidden in the living room and trying to find all possible endings.The ""vanilla"" ending got me sweaty palms and I almost didn't want to continue. Great atmosphere, great graphics and excellent sound design together make this a worthile experience.One nitpick I'd have is the shooting part: while it's fun on its own, when you want to explore the game for its story elements, I wish there would be a skip button to experiment with the outside stuff more. It does become repetitive after a while.And I haven't gotten all endings yet and already got almost 5 hours into this game."
,Recommended,503580,34989322,Posted: 15 September,all,Spookthos,"I bought this game because I wanted a vr game that would let me SIT. However, I found myself more than once rolling my eyes and tried shooting the gun with one hand, which isn't as hard as they wanted it to be. You time it, and you can kill every duck like it's nothing, even with it swaying. I wish It wasn't a yes or no question, me recomending this game, because it's not a BAD game, it's just not worth the price from what I can tell. I will edit this as I play it more."

Myself being a 80's child simply loves every aspect of this game. Love the Spielbergian setting! Great storytelling!I should say that I don't know if 2/7 endings count but it got a bit repetitive and I quit. Will probably play though the rest.
,Recommended,503580,35072330,Posted: 19 September,all,Mamajamas in Pajamas,"Really polished, extremely creative and hilarious, and a ton of fun. If you are craving a serious horror experience, this will probably let you down. If however you are more wary of horror vr games as I am, this will provide you with just the right amount of creepiness and jumps. The whole experience will last you about 40 minutes (though there are plenty of Easter eggs and alternate endings for replay).My one big complaint is that for as much of the gameplay as the duck hunt portions take up, not much is done to keep them fresh. The duck hunt games eventually become a bit of a monotonous chore after a while.This game makes up for that complaint in many other areas though. If you're down for a game that's hilarious, a little creepy, and really out there, definitely check this out. This is acactly the kind of game that VR should be all about."

There's a lot of nastalgia in this game which younger players might not appreciate, but production value was excellent and the attention to details in the various shows and little games was incredible, hats off to the development team.Yes it is shortish for an initial play through of under 2hours, but there will be some value on playing through again. Regardless, I look forward to having my friends play at least the practice mode to see if they can beat my high score, starts getting pretty difficult around level 13."

What did it do?  It recaptured exactly how I felt as a child playing Duck Hunt on Nintendo.What's amazing about Duck Season though is that it reinvents this classic concept for VR and adds an unsettling backstory checkered with the comforting toys, magazines and home life from my childhood.  In essence, Duck Season reinvents the 80s childhood familiarity with a tingling notion that something is very wrong.  It's the type of theme you commonly see in classic 80s cinema.I love the perspective of being inside the TV and looking back at my childhood self.  I love the clunky 8-bit parody games on the game console.  I love my ""Mom"" busy in the background.  The controls are glorious - basically point and grab to avoid having locomotion around the whole scene (sometimes I just want to stand or sit on the carpet and not work much).I have not finished the game, but I am on Level 5 of the in-game Duck Season game.  The clock is ticking and I can tell♥♥♥♥♥♥is about to go very wrong - mainly because I've been shooting the dog.  I got a feeling that was not smart.  ""Honey, have you seen the knife?""No Mom!  I haven't seen the knife.  Do you need a knife to make me some tots?  I'm about to commit to a marathon session of killing ducks and I need some food.GREAT GAME.  Cheap at $20."

TONS of secrets and easter eggs, and a fun collection of bizarre short films and mini games for when you want to take a break from hunting ducks.  Also, if you grew up in the 80's/90's you may be overwhelmed with nostalgia.I recommend going into this game knowing as little about it as possible, and just enjoying the head trip.  A single playthrough will only take you about 1.5 hrs, but you won't have seen a fraction of the content and will definitely want to make multiple playthroughs, taking time to explore.Edit: I've completed all 7 endings, and discovered all secrets.
