Just some suggestions.Wish for more content like quest, or daily challenges where you can earn more gold and rewards.More maps, monsters and items.Or maybe skill sets where we can choose to build, like ice skills to slow or freee enemies. Player can either play fire or ice or even hybrid.Imagine If we can grab the thrown axes landed on the wooden pillars and throw it back at them, that would be very cool. Or shoot the incoming axe with our arrow."

,Recommended,503770,25460069,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,The Beautiful,"Update: Many people are trying to say this game ripped off QuiVR, however development of this game started BEFORE the QuiVR demo was released for SteamVR, and the only thing that makes the game similar is the use of a bow, and having Orcs as an enemy (which is canon for fantasy anyways). I personally like this game more than QuiVR and dodging incoming attacks is not a part of QuiVR, however both games are great - there doesn't have to be just one archery fantasy game. Also, it seems a tad unfair to me that half of these reviews are from players with 5-8 minutes or less played.Original review:I don't often write reviews but I felt compelled to write one tonight after playing this game because I'm glad to support it!This game is a pure bow game, with excellent pullback mechanics. The bow responds well, aims well, and just feels nice. Less like Holopoint and more like the tower defense from The Lab (both great games).It's also worth mentioning it can be a bit of a workout when you have to start dodging axes, luckily it didn't take me too long to learn and somehow I squeezed out the number three spot on the leaderboards (for now) haha.If you're on the fence, pick it up, it's easily as fun as Holopoint and right now on this sale it's almost just a third of the price. You won't be disappointed!I did not receive this game for free, it was just a random pickup when searching for games via the ""release date"" option on the steam store."

Lets combo it with sword mechanics eventually with an area to teleport to for melee and the experience will be even better. So stoked to see where this goes.

The orcs fling axes at you that you must evade. The THUNK after they whiz past you really seems like it could remove  your head!The level design is more closed in which means enemies progress quicker than in Quivr and in greater numbers which speeds up the game play.

The gameplay is simple but addictive. The game also gets very hard, so I would highly recommend playing with people online. The orcs throw axes at you, which you have to dodge by squatting or jumping out of the way, which gets really exhausting but adds a lot of challenge and fun (By the end of my play session, my thighs, forearms, and butt were very sore haha).I can't recommend this game for the singleplayer experience, because you can die by one axe to the face, instead of just your outpost being destroyed (which kills the fun for me personally).Multiplayer however, is a blast and I highly recommend it!

The artwork is great, I like the concept of the Orcs going through the buildings, and the different colors used to signify who (in multiplayer) hit is a great idea.  It's really close to being a great game, but the bow physics just killed it for me and I ended up refunding.It's an archery shooting game.  No matter how pretty and cool the wrapping is, if shooting the bow doesn't feel good, it's a waste of money.  And unfortunately the aim is maddening in this.

,Recommended,503770,28506315,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,Introitus,"This game has been simply great. When I first purchased my Vive I was immediately drawn into the longbow mini game included in the 'The Lab'. I searched Steam for similar content and stumbled into this gem. In the Elven Assassin you play as an archer trying to protect a fortress from orcs invaders. It's a wave based shooter, with the aim to to survive as long as possible. The game also includes a co-op multiplayer option, which I have  found the most enjoyable part of the game.The bow mechanics are similar to those in 'The Lab', but a lot more refined. That being said it still needs some work, in particular with making aiming feel more natural. The game also gives you the ability to defend different areas of the fortress using a cleverly implemented teleport function, which requires the player to shoot the bow in the direction of the desired location.In future updates I would love to see improved animations and audio. All the orcs seem to have the same unnatural 'plop' to the ground as they die. A little variation would go a long way. Also, the 'They're breaking in!' voice over could do with some nice voice acting, and perhaps some dramatic music.All-in-all this game was a great experience, and definitely worth the cost compared to other Vive games. I look forward to seeing how this game develops with time."

Ping rates for closest servers are shown - nice idea.The biggest issue i had with was with the bow dynamics - it just didn't feel right and was hard to aim. That improved with practice but maybe the people of Elf town should do a deal with Quivr village and buy their bows from them. Don't trade the elven helmets for them tho' cos those things are useless. Maybe it's optimistic to think they'd stop an axe thrown by a 400lb Orc but perhaps they could do a deal with the fairies so you could get health hits every time you're whacked in the back of the head. One hit to the head and you're out of the game and it's hard to watch every sneaky Orc ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The American accented alert 'Theyre breaking in' was handy but maybe a European accent with helpful stuff like 'They are making rear entry'or 'Orcs coming down the back passage' would be better.This is a nice addition to the genre and a fun game for the price."

It is basically a tower defense game where you play the tower. The enemies follow a pretty simple path and you have to kill them before they get to a certain point. Once in a while they will throw an axe at you that you have to dodge or it kills you with one hit. There are a few things you get like fire arrows, but the mechanic for using them is kind of awkward. Overall it feels like you've seen all the game has to offer in just a few rounds of gameplay. The bow and arrow mechanics themselves do work well and feel good though.

The graphics look nice but the way the guys move and die just seems... off... Maybe they just don't move enough as they walk, or their animations are too slow for the distance, or the animations are meant for faster speeds or something. I really don't know.Apart from that clunkiness that I can't properly express, dodging the axes takes too much time. They move too slow and take import time away that I could be shooting. I have to dodge all too far out of the way to dodge them as well. Maybe make them throw vertical rather than horizontal and perhaps a bit faster with sound so we know it's coming?It's also just ""another wave shooter"" without a unique dynamic to set it apart. QuiVR has us chasing down gates to close and healing them with skill-based shooting. I felt no rewards from killing guys apart from making it to another round and saying ""yeah, I got to wave XX."" And then if I want to beat my score, I have to sit through another 30 minutes of waves 1 through XX. QuiVR has dynamic difficulty so it increases with your skill so you don't have to wait forever to get your challenge on.I also didn't feel the need to move from place to place. The center seemed like the best spot with no great advantage in other locations yet it still had blind places where I couldn't shoot at the guys and had to simply wait.I also could not hear the guys coming from behind me. So while I'm busy shooting guys, I have no idea there's like 10 behind me. Unless, after every shoot, I look back. Perhaps I'd get used to it, but I want to involve more senses.The uniqueness, mainly, is in the graphics of orcs and locale. Make it something more than a wave shooter and it could be great. I like elves, I like elven-looking territories, I like shooting a bow, but it's not enough to make me feel the presence.Lastly, I just didn't feel like the aiming was right. It always seemed to shoot far more to the right than where I was aiming. Again, this could be just that I'm used to QuiVR, but from The Lab to QuiVR I didn't get that same feeling. I have shot a bow in real life and I imagine that there should be a ""correct"" way to shoot in VR that matches exactly to real-life shooting. I didn't get that strange ""not where I aimed"" feeling with the other two games, and I really didn't want to retrain my brain with another bow in fear that it might mess up my aiming in QuiVR :-)."

I love it when they throw there axes as you have to duck out the way.Also having enermies come from your blind spot may be a great idea on paper but it gets old fast.The bow mechanics feel clunky compared to Valves own efforts. THis has alot with how you hold the controller as you cannot keep it upright all the time, you should be able to hold it at a more nature 45 degree angle in your hand.I hope the developer fleshes it out abit so its more fun, using a bow in VR is a great idea when done right."

When I spent the money, I didn't realize that I was buying a gym membership too, dodging flying axes while shooting arrows definably got the blood pumping. Playing on co-op is the way to go, there are just too many orcs to head shot at the higher levels. It is also very satisfying to get past 15 + waves without the town being damaged while playing with 3 other people online. I have heard that there are some lag issues when not the host, but I have only been the host so far therefore I can’t confirm if this is still an issue or if just poor internet on the other players part. I will have to say my biggest complaint is that the few hours I have spent on so far there was only a few people online playing.

And in my opinion, Elven Assassin is among the very best.This was the first game that both my Dad and I purchased after we each bought our Vive’s over a year ago. Mostly for the multiplayer co-op play. And after all that time this is still the game we come back to over and over to play together.The gameplay is fundamentally simple. Waves of Orcs, Trolls, and Dragons try to infiltrate the gate you're defending.Some orcs throw axes which you need to duck and dodge, and the giant Dragon will breath fire on your team if you don't kill it in time.The arrow mechanics are second to none. Any subtle way that you hold the bow or the arrow will influence the trajectory of where you shoot. You don't feel inhibited by the shooting mechanics at all.There’s currently three maps to play in: Elven Town, Human Village, and Human Castle.The castle is multiplayer only, but it features unique weapons like a catapult.As you play more you will rank up and earn experience points which you can use to buy magical spells. After you buy spells you can summon them whenever you draw an arrow and use your bow hand thumb pad to select to spell you want (for me it’s the left hand), then the arrow you fire will create the spell. The spells are really handy for taking out large groups of orcs.I find this game enjoyable in both single player and multiplayer. And like I said before this is one of those games my Dad and I keep playing together over and over again. I highly recommend it."
