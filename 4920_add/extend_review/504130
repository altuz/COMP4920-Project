,Recommended,504130,26061240,"Posted: 15 October, 2016",all,ElusiveOne,"Manual Samuelmanages to be both hilarious and frustrating as it introduces a new form of ""tedious fun"" to the virtual theatre of the absurd.Ludicrous humour is unmistakably its centerpiece, complemented with perfect narration and soundtrack, inspired 70's cartoon style, measured hashtags and attitude, and a fully original premise without equal. Every character is a marvel of ingenuity, from the gangsta-wannabe Death to the overly polite Hell police.The game has an excessively generous count of the word 'feces' but otherwise it constantly serves puns and antics worthy of the best absurd and carefree comedies.The whole concept revolves around the one idea of using ridiculously uncomfortable controls to perform the simplest tasks. Its originality makes it an instant classic but the novelty also wears off surprisingly quickly, leaving the player with annoying limitations and a repetitiveness that would merit a negative review under any other circumstance.Every section of the game offers something unique and most of them introduce their new ideas smoothly, perhaps with the exception of combat sequences. The final boss fight in particular is a trial and error of nonsense in a sequence that must essentially be memorized and executed perfectly.You don't so much fail as simply not succeed, so the game lets you easily retry until you get it right, without having to reload a checkpoint. Most sections are highly enjoyable and easy enough to be completed on the first try; only a few tenuous ones can be irritating.The game is also very short but its length is perfect for what's on offer. Manual Samuel is worth your time for its boldness and cleverness but it is as much fun as it becomes a strain to play (figuratively and literally). By the time it was over, I felt relieved, but also quite satisfied at having played and enjoyed one of the most unique games in existence.A game controller is highly recommended along with some level of dexterity and patience. Sense of humour not optional."
,Recommended,504130,33001727,Posted: 29 June,all,Sog,"Samuel dies, but is allowed to go back to life on one condition: that he must perform every single function on his body manually for 24 hours. He has to breathe manually and blink consciously. Walking is not intuitive to him, and he can barely talk; when he does, he sounds like a complete idiot.I almost refunded this game because I already experience these things every single day in real life. Why should I have to endure it during leisure time? But in the end—spoiler alert, I guess—at least the 24 hour period ends and you go back to normal. So thank you, Manual Samuel, for letting me know what it feels like to be normal again.The sardonic British narrator is a nice touch too. My life isn't narrated by a British gentleman, but rather by some sort of ape? I'm not sure, I've never seen him, but he sounds incoherent and makes it difficult for me to fall asleep. Overall this game is a perfect 10/10. It made me laugh so hard that my sphincter almost left my body along with its contents."

We've been laughing and giggling non-stop, struggling with the basics of every-day survival breathing and blinking while managing to brush our teeth or to put some clothes on without dying.Of course the core gameplay only consists of pushing some buttons, preferedly in the right order to make the main character progress. But the game is so much more. It's more like a modern interpretation of slapstick, along with some dry humor and outstanding writing and narration. The only downside is the short duration (about 2 hours).I started watching some gameplay yesterday and almost decided not to buy the game, because it looked like an interactive film where it doesn't really matter if you push the buttons yourself or just watch. Ohh boy was I wrong. The main fun comes from the struggle to perfom a basic task like brushing teeth or peeing IN the toilet (not all over the place) and in the process forgetting the basic bodily functions like in- and exhaling, standing up straight or blinking. But don't worry, the narrator will remind you of it. If you can, try to play it in coop to increase the fun.A simple but great idea put together flawlessly. Thanks to the developers for the laughs and hats off to the narrator!"

,Recommended,504130,35030746,Posted: 17 September,all,Pennycook,"Manual Samuelis built around a simple mechanic: each button on your controller maps to a different part of Sam's body (right arm, left arm, right leg, left leg) or bodily function (breathe in, breathe out, blink), and you must guide him through a number of simple tasks by following on-screen prompts.  In co-op, it's more complicated: half of Sam's body is assigned to each player, and even simple tasks like walking require close coordination to pull off.The game itself is quite funny -- its take on the personification of Death particularly so -- but a lot of the laugh-out-loud moments in the early levels stem from mistimed button presses and lack of familiarity with the controls.  Such failures become less funny and more frustrating as the game progresses, but never enough so that we wanted to stop playing.Manual Samuel's controller support is great, and worthy of an honourable mention.  My wife and I played with one Steam controller and one PS4 controller, and the game was smart enough to show the correct button prompts from different controllers for different players.  This small touch was very much appreciated, and something that I wish more developers took the time to do properly."

,Recommended,504130,26100702,"Posted: 18 October, 2016",all,RipWitch,"How would life be if you had to do everything manually? If suddenly, you had to think about breathing and blinking? ""Manual Samuel"" uses this premise as the game's focus point. Play Samuel, a rich kid that did not have to anything to this point, suddently having to do everything manually after a deal with Death.Manual Samuel's focus point is that simple tasks being really difficult once you have to think about actions you unconciously do, and Manual Samuel runs with this idea. Each section is unique, bringing new tasks while advancing in this story. The humour is something, and is usually not what you often see anymore. The narrator accompanies you the whole way, providing most of the humour through their dialogue, especially when you skip cutscenes and at the end. However, it does not outshine the other characters in the game, as they each provide their own humour. The voice acting is surperb throughout, and only made the game better as you progressed.There is no failing in Manual Samuel, only not succeeding as the game will let you try again. To compensate for this, the enemies also heal while you recover so you can go through with trial and error instead of relying on being knocked down to progress. This is important as combat becomes important towards bosses, and as you move onto completing the time trials the game unlocks.While it is short, it is important to know that doing everything manually may become taxing on the player. The only negatives is that controls may not respond the first time (which can be annoying especially when trying to do time trials) and Sam's spine.Manual Samual does have local co-op, so you and someone else can take control of half of Sam's functions and try to work together. It is also recommended to play with a controller than with a keyboard. Overall, Manual Samual is a fun little game with great humour and voice acting."

Even getting stuck for what felt like 15 minutes on one part of the last boss, this game took me and my gf 2.3 hours to beat.  And while the first 2/3 of the game is funny, goofy, and charming, the final area is kind of a sloppy chore."
,Not Recommended,504130,29053863,Posted: 5 January,all,Jo Black,"I would like to recommend this game, really, but the final act totally ruins the experience, bringing everything to a grinding halt for what is otherwise a humor and story driven game.It's got fair-to-ok humor, lots of jokes that reminded me of the old Diskworld games, especially with the narrator interactions. However the humor is clearly targeting men, as the jokes are mostly physical humor, denigration and toilet laughs. Samuel literally pisses all over himself, and repeatedly vomits as a function of the game, which often comes across as lazy humor.As you go through the tasks, you'll find that each act gives you the intro controls to a task before you have to perform. You'll have the chance to fail without consequence, before being put to the task. There are several mini-bosses, whom defeating is a task of memorization of attack sequences, and appropriate responses, however most bosses are only two or three stage ordeals, which the stage prepared you for by teaching the skills needed; like how to use a shield or a weapon. Generally the acts move along at a good clip, without getting bogged down in too many repetitive tasks, or punishments for awkward controls.But then there's the final boss, where it really falls apart.In no uncertain terms, the final boss is an absolute mess. You have to contend with a timed button pressing slider, utilized only a handful time times previously in the game, which seems to lag to respond as I could not get a reliable 'sweet spot' on the slider button press. Plus I was expecting more than 'memorize this' as the final boss fight, which was dissapointing and frustrating.However the biggest sin of the final boss fight is how dull and boring it is. Even in the immediately previous minion fight there was quips and some attempt at humor to break up the repetition of the manual actions of combat. However the final boss fight is void of humor, narration, or anything to break up the 'try, try, try again' design of the fight.The game is entertaining for the most part. It  does a good job of being forgiving and providing a ramped up learning curve as the game progresses. The grannies in the car stage was one of the funniest moments for me. But you will run into a wall on the final boss, and you will bang your head against that wall.In the end the level of frustration the game presented was, for me, not equal to the level of enjoyment. This is certainly going into my 'done with' category, and I would recommend it only to those who enjoy this kind of humor, and are willing to bull through the controls on the final boss. If you don't like the humor, or controls, in the first fifteen minutes, then you will not like this game."

The art is crisp, the narration is funny and the animations are sometimes plain hilarious. It's also chock full of original, clever ideas vaguely resembling the ""Octodad"" style of gameplay.All these things make it definitely worth checking out.Less praiseworthy however is the length. It's a fair price if  you see how much work went into this charming game, but I was done with it in just a smidge over 2 hours. A good half an hour of which was spent on a terribly frustrating end boss. Where the rest of the game is a masterclass of good design, the final fight is pretty much the exact opposite of that. Frustrating, unforgiving, and most importantly, lacking proper distinguishable feedback.After finishing the single- or local coop campaign you will have the option of trying again in a time attack mode. Personally, that doesn't interest me much because I bought it for the novelty, the story and the experience.So would I recommend this? Yes. Would I say I got my money's worth?

First level is you walking, second level is you driving, third level is you walking, fourth level is you walking, fifth level is you walking. Final boss throws everything out of the window and has you remember his attacks in basically a QTE.Also there's no fail state. Even in levels where you have a health bar it just gets filled back up when it runs out. If there's no challenge in a game like this it's just a trudge against bad controls.Writing pretty clearly isn't English as a first language.Not worth it's current price."

Well done creator. Although the game was a bit hard to do hence ""manual"" in the name, I do not wanna reccomend this game because it has a lot of issues in it. But I will give Pros and Cons of the game :)Pros:- The animation of the game is beautiful and the art style is okay-okay- The storyline was cute, Love the ending by the wayI didn't actually finish the game because I was still having the keyboard issue problem at the end of the game so I decided to watch the end of the game myself on youtube because I earned it from going so far into the game- It makes your hands active and lets you have a free mind other than pure rage, You don't have to do at leasteverythingmanually at least ;)Cons:- The game doesn't really have many options to do, Wishing there was more than at least 3-4 hours of playtime for it. Maybe if the creator adds more story in the *Next?* game he/she makes then it would be more interesting to me- The controls for the Keyboard side are extremely wacky, they need to be fixed, If you maybe use the left and right sides of the mouse instead of Z and C for walking it would make the game a little more easier for the keyboards that don't support 3 keys down at the same time- Having more characters to interact with in the game would be fantastic making the game a bit more harder to do certain tasks in the gameSorry for not reccomending the game, But if you want to really buy it I suggest you MAJORLY use a controller rather than using Keyboard, if you can't or you don't have a controller, don't buy it because the game would be literally impossible to complete with the keyboard because of all the issues and bugs for it"

You need a controller for this game, it makes it a hell´a lot more fun!]Japanese studios like Platinum games often get praised for having an excellent control over the character you command, like in Bayonetta, Nier-A-tomato or any other of their games they´ve made. At least if you´d ask one of my friends (who´s totally not a FAN BOY! #sarcasm)In this game you have none.Or in some regards you have to control ALL of Samuel´s otherwise autonomus bodily functions. Breath in, breath out. Blink your eyes, speak, grip, drink, swallow etc, etc.However, it isnot that hardin this game as in ""Octodad"" or ""Surgeon simulator"" since this is done in a 2d setting, the ""FUN FACTOR"" stays through the entire game, almost.Some of the later levels are a bit frustrating to play. But not too frustrating mind you!So the verdict?I´d recommend this game to everyone! Hell it´s a short game, but I got some real laughs from it!Pros:+ Great control over Samuel.+ Super great graphics! Really love the aesthetics!+ Phenomenally (is that a word?) funny!+ Slapstick.Cons:- Some parts are hard as ballz.- You are the games reason it is hard! Or rather, your multi-tasking capacity is."

The graphic is 2D but it is carefully crafted and the msuic for the game is just awesome! But the controls of it sometimes will not accept input as smoothly as some of the other games, but that is totally fine, because as I follows the tutorial and had that deep learning curve (or I should rather say the falt but hard learning curve) of the controls, no key spamming was needed. The game is short, it only took 2.3 hours to complete it. The one thing that this game needs more is hints (if you enables them), we need more of those. Afterall 10/10, no matter how the THUMBS-DOWNS criticise the game, I reccommend everyone to just buy and try it, the style will just make you love the game.BTW, the music is although electrical synthesised, the quality of it could be compared with classical pieces played by the finest ochestras, and so the feeling it creates adds more grandness to the hard earned progress and achievements(cus the game made me smarsh my computer five times when I was stuck on the final boss battle."

At times it wasn't entirely clear what you had to do, but some testing and trying made that not too much of a problem. A few hints here and there couldn't hurt, at least if you fail something ten times in a row (boss battle for example).To the people saying you can't finish this game on PC: You need a proper keyboard. It's a known issue since forever, GTA San Andreas has the same problem, you couldn't drive donuts on some keyboards because you had to press WSD at the same time, most keyboards are made for typing and not for gaming. Never had that problem as I buy Logitech G-series keyboards, but read about it way back. A gaming keyboard is smarter about the way it sends signals to your PC and will support a lot of keystrokes at the same time.I played with the Steam controller, and it was a lot of fun. I kind of doubt it would be as much fun on a keyboard, honestly. But I haven't tried. It felt a bit like Surgeon Simulator, the awkward ""I should know what I'm doing but it's not working"" kind of thing that makes you rethink how you even do stuff. Story was silly with fun humor. Lovable characters.Nothing too special, but I have no regrets buying this game. If it's on sale and you liked Surgeon Simulator, probably buy it?
