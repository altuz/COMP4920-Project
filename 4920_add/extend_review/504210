,Not Recommended,504210,25938646,"Posted: 8 October, 2016",all,Erroneous Bosch,"This is one of those cases where I really wish there was a more neutral option for recommendations, as it pains me to bring down the score of a Zachtronics game, and for people who already know how to code this is a game I would 100% recommend. Personally I found it overwhelming in the extreme, because the way in which the manual is written assumes you already have a base level of competence with programming, and there is absolutely no effort made within the game to familiarise you with practical implementations of the functions the manual describes. If you're after a game that might teach you a bit about programming, this is not it.Spacechem is my favourite game of all time, and Infinifactory is not far behind, but if Zach intends to make his future projects as unwelcoming and opaquely explained as TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O, this is simply a path down which I cannot follow him. I very much hope that his next game might cut neophytes like myself some slack, otherwise I guess I'm done with my favourite developer.Edit: I deliberately kept my playtime low to keep the possibility of a refund open (one I've since taken up), however I spent at least an hour poring over the manual before even booting the game up, and closed and restarted the game many times after consulting the manual to try and come up with a solution. I gave it much more than 30 minutes of my time, but it just didn't click with me.And before giving this a thumbs down, please keep in mind that 'Did you find this helpful?' is not synonymous with 'Do you share this person's assessment of the product and find that the level of enjoyment they derived from it closely matches your own?'Edit 2: This review has attracted way more attention than I had anticipated. It was written quickly on a first-and-last-impressions sort of basis, so I didn't go into much detail. At this stage I feel I have a duty to provide more context about myself and how this affects my enjoyment of the game.An argument could be made that I was stupid for buying this after having difficulty with TIS-100. I bought SHENZHEN I/O because it was made clear that TIS-100 was a side project created for a very niche audience, and the visually dreary interface itself reinforced this. From the trailer, SHENZHEN I/O seemed like it would have much broader appeal - an attractive interface that made use of the mouse, the usual great Zachtronics music, actual promotion in the lead-up to its release. I thought that, while employing similar concepts to TIS-100, it would make them more accessible. I was wrong. And it's possible that assembly programming mightn't ever be something I find accessible.Personally, I suck with numbers. I hate them. As it turns out, assembly programming deals with almost nothing but numbers. I didn't go into this blind, however - I had a quick look at what assembly programming looked like, and, true to my username, I made an erroneous assumption: I assumed that the numbers were not used in the sense ofvaluebut, rather, purely assymbol. For example, in a sudoku puzzle, the numeral 9 doesn't actually represent a quantity of nine units, it's just a symbol interchangeable with any other character which simply represents a guarantee that there are certain other places in the grid within which it cannot appear. In the context of assembly, I assumed it would work on the basis of 0 representing an off position and 1 representing an on, and similarly simple functions. Numberscanfunction in this way, however they also often need to be used in a quantitative context, functioning within complex, infinitely repeating algorithms. If this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, don't bother with SHENZHEN I/O, or assembly programming in general.I got along with Spacechem and Infinifactory because their circuits used sensors which worked on the basis of 'if x = true then do y'. Simple stuff, with which you can make extremely complex devices. Assembly works more on the basis of 'if x = more than n squared divided by acc then do y, else do z'. Complex stuff, with which you can make even more complex devices. I'm sure that someone more experienced could give a far better explanation than that, but I think I at least have the nuts and bolts correct. SHENZHEN I/O requires not just the purely visual logic of Infini/chem (i.e. how do I combine and transport these ready-made products) but numeric logic as well (i.e. how do I make these ready-made products function differently by playing with the digits within them). One works with objects, while the other works with concepts.I have to reiterate, there is no problem with the game - its standard of presentation is right up there with any other commercial release from Zachtronics and it plays just fine. That said, there is a portion of the Zachtronics audience to whom this game will not appeal, and for whom this game was not made, so I've written this for their benefit. I put it into the 'not recommended' category, not to disparage it, but because I truly would not recommend the game to a person with my tastes. My abilities with programming and numbers in general are not of such a standard that I could write a 'recommended' review which would offer anything more than uselessly facile, vague praise, directed towards an audience I'm unfamiliar with. I instead put it into the category where I could offer honest opinions of my own."

To be honest, the sentiment is well reasoned. However, what I think these people miss is how much better of a programmer doing puzzles can make you.The key to developing your ability to think algorithmically is to approach familiar problems in new ways. The easiest way to do this is to give yourself arbitrary constraints, such as limiting the data types you allow yourself to use, etc. Putting yourself in tight constraints forces you to think creatively and that skill will put you miles ahead of where you would be if you always took the easy route. A great analogy is the skill guitar players are encouraged by their teachers to develop from day one: learn where all the notes are on each string. When you start out you might not understand how important this skill is, but then one day you watch the video of Jimi Hendrix playing Red House at Woodstock and, after his high-E string snaps, plays one of the most legendary solos of all time with only five strings.Shenzhen I/O is a game that will help you become a better programmer in the same way that learning every note position on the guitar will help you be a better musician. The game, due to its sparse and creatively constrained assembly language, will force you to think outside of the high-level programming box. For example, what is the optimal way to create an AND condition with only IF conditionals and instruction jumps? These types of ""arbitrary"" constraints are difficult to force yourself into in practice, but the environment of a puzzle game helps alleviate the sense of arbitrariness.Shenzhen I/O, like TIS-100, uses a made up programming language. However, as any third year CS student will tell you, all Turning complete programming languages allow you to compute the same exact things. The real world skills you develop from playing this game are not that of learning a powerful, new language that will make every program you write in the future trivially easy. The skills you gain are the same stated above: an increased ability to think algorithmically. Realizing that CS is a giant tapestry of computable functions and there's more than one way to compute a function is the first step towards becoming a good programmer. Increasing your ability to creatively implement algorithms will help you in the long run more so than sticking with one language and implementation scheme could ever do."

,Recommended,504210,26686409,"Posted: 18 November, 2016",all,Goldkin,"SHENZHEN I/O is a game that will make you a better engineer. If this appeals to you, read further.Unlike SpaceChem and Infinifactory, which focus on spatial reasoning, SHENZHEN (and its predecessor, TIS-100) dive into coding in assembly. What this loses in presentation, it makes up for in depth: the puzzles generally have more compact solutions, requiring more planning, and almost always require a divide-and-conquer approach to succeed.If this is not your thing, stick to other Zachtronics titles or other puzzle games. If this _is_ your thing and you have yet to play TIS-100, play that first. Puzzles in SHENZHEN will build on the principles of sorting, searching, and solving that you'll learn there.TIS-100 can thus be considered the 100 level course to SHENZHEN's 200 and 300 level courses. Since many of the puzzles in both games are inspired by real algorithms and computer architecture principles, you'll learn a thing or two about how professional software engineering works, too.The biggest improvement over TIS-100 is story and scope. The story is _fantastic_, easily exceeding the writing quality of SpaceChem and Infinifactory (and providing depth and heart that would be too spoilery to describe). The language and modules give you far more freedom than any other Zachtronics title to date, even allowing you to design your own (TI Calculator-like) games within the game. Seriously, check the forums, those games are amazing.The primary drawback to SHENZHEN I/O is its difficulty and its reliance on the manual (by design). SHENZHEN is unashamedly not a casual puzzle game -- it is a game that requires investment, paying that investment back in triplicate.If you're a puzzle game affectionado or a programmer looking to expand the limits of what you thought yourself capable of, pick this up. If you made it through TIS-100 and hunger for more, pick this up. Otherwise, sincerely do not buy this unless you are prepared for the challenge."

,Recommended,504210,26187683,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,SeaJay,"TL;DR:Shenzhen is a worthy Zachtronics game about assembly programming. If you like Zachtronics games and/or you're a filthy nerd like me, don't hesitate to pick this one up.OverviewShenzhen I/O is a game where you play a budding young engineer who moves to China to pursue an engineering job at Longteng Electronics. Your tasks consist of constructing and programming simple gadgets out of microcontrollers, logic gates, memory units, and so on. Also in your job description is fighting badly-translated datasheets, scribbling down undocumented behavior, exploiting the hidden assumptions within the automated testcases, and turning a convenient blind eye to the increasingly suspicious entities that Longteng takes contracts from...So... is it fun?If assembly programming and RTFM is your kind of thing, then yes! Definitely print out the manual on paper and bind it for extra authenticity.The learning curve is well-balanced. The early puzzles are straightforward, and the increase in difficulty is fairly gradual, but the eventual difficulty ceiling is very high. A hallmark of Zachtronics games is that they're not overly hard to beat per se, but they are incredibly difficult to master. Any solution is good enough for you to progress as long as it's correct, so you might not have trouble scrapping together apassablesolution to a problem, but beware! The game will show you histograms of how your solution compares to players around the world. If you're anything like me, this will drive you to improve every solution to be at least above average, so you're not that shmuck on the bottom end of that bell curve.If you're the tinkering and experimenting type, iterating (heh) over your past designs hugely extends Shenzhen's potential gameplay time. The histograms display yourbestdesign cost and yourbestdesign power, so you can make a dedicated design for each metric. Over time, you will accrue more knowledge about the hardware you're working with, you'll have access to more hardware choices and little programming tricks, and this will make you want to go back and see how many yuan/watts you can shave off your old designs. Hell, you will more than likely find yourself going back to thevery first tutorial puzzleto optimise it with your new-found knowledge. I know I did.I've already played TIS-100, how does Shenzhen compare to that?TIS-100 is a more rigidly structured, purer programming game with a heavier emphasis on speed and parallelism. Data comes in as fast as your design can accept it. One of my best TIS-100 programs used 7 processors pipelined together to process data in huge batches.Shenzhen is different in that the structure is much more freeform, and the emphasis is on cost and power, meaning the lowest amount of effort required to meet the specification. Your layout and component choice is just as important as your programming ability. There's no real notion of 'speed' since your microcontrollers are infinitely fast and you sleep to advance to the next game tick, so there's rarely incentive to parallelise.The assembly language itself is also different. Rather than the conditional jumps which formed the basis of control flow in TIS-100, you set ARM-style comparison flags using test instructions and then conditionally executeanykind of instruction, allowing for an appreciably different programming style.I'm a complete newcomer to programming. Will I struggle?I would say that Shenzhen is approachable enough for non-programmers (as long as you put in some effort), but a challenging game for even seasoned assembly programmers to finish in its entirety. If you want a more gentle (but probably less interesting) introduction, try Human Resource Machine instead.How useful is knowing Chinese?Not very. You will mostly glean a bit more backstory.Why not just do some real programming?That's like saying ""why play FIFA when you could go out and play real football."" It's just not the same experience. If it was, there wouldn't be so many people playing Shenzhen after arriving home from the programming they get paid to do.Besides, you do develop the same kind of skills, so it's not like your time is wasted, far from it.Why should I not buy this game?Don't buy this game if you don't like (or think that you would like) programming. ~20% of the game is high-level (routing and placement and whatnot), and the remaining ~80% is hardcore assembly programming. If you know that that's not your jam, then neither is this game.Don't buy this game if you're impatient or don't like feeling dumb sometimes. The later puzzles are devilishly difficult and will have the smartest among us kneading their temples. It's not something you can pick up and succeed at without some head-scratching and careful thought."

The only other Zachtronics game that I have played is TIS-100 and that will be my benchmark in this review (since Zachtronics games are quite different from other types of games).~ Gameplay ~By far the most intimidating thing about Shenzhen I/O is the 40+-paged manual. However it was a pleasant surprise to discover that most of the pages are just ""filler."" The only pages that we need to read to begin playing are those in the Language Reference and Parts Datasheets sections.Compared to TIS-100, Shenzhen I/O is actually enjoyable! The problems that we solve serve a clear purpose, and sometimes we can even see our programs in action! For example, when we are asked to create a program for a gardening robot, we can actually SEE our program in action as the robot executes our code.In the early game, most of my gameplay involved tinkering with the components and code, trying to understand the nuances of the game. Towards the end, I found myself spending most of my time away from the code and thinking about the problems instead.~ Story ~We play the role of a young enginner in the near future (around 2024) who is forced to move to China to find work. Despite the initial culture shock of a dystopian society, we quickly find ourselves surrounded by a dynamic cast of coworkers, including other expats facing the same circumstances.Over the course of the campaign, we discover the nuances of their characters, including their hidden insecurities and grandest ambitions.In my opinion, cast of Shenzhen I/O feel just as alive, if not more so, than even some characters from story-based games!~ Visuals/Music/Ambiance ~The interface is mind-blowingly good, especially for a puzzle game (or perhaps I've simply been traumatized by TIS-100).

I have evolved to the point where I simply look at the Zachtronics name and the thumbnail and buy the game.

Although I have not read many, I am sure several of the reviews at this point posit this is not a game for everyone. They are right. The accompanying manual is not recommended it is required and the learning curve may be more of a cliff at times. If you have played TIS-100, which I wholeheartedly recommend, the language will be slightly different and yet familiar. That being said, if you stick it out (and I hope you do) you will find one of the most powerful and interesting logic puzzle games I have ever seen. It can sometimes be frustrating, but seeing one of your designs fly through the testing phase is supremely satisfying on the verge of pure joy. I cannot recommend this game enough.

Rather, I left the game open idling on my desktop, and personally got up from my desk and started painstakingly searching my house for a proper 3-ring binder and other menial office supplies to store the game's 40+ page instruction manual, a manual that is pretty much mandatory to even start playing the game.And you know what? I loved every minute of it.This game's way of world building through something as simple as a printable instruction manual is something I've never seen a game do before (at least, not in the past decade or so). The way the individual pages look like they were hastingly printed from random pre-Web 2.0 webpages, or the way you're highly encouraged to build the equivalent of a portfolio just for this game alone, is all really incredible. It makes the game feel less like a video game, and more like an elusive second job.I could also go on about how much I love the actual, like, ""game"" part of SHENZHEN as well, but I have a feeling that's been long talked about by others. Basically, it's computer programming in its sheerest form: pure problem solving and quantitative logistics, without any of the ""aimless probing through 10+ year old internet forums to figure out why a certain function just isn't working,"" a familiar staple to actual programming. It's highly dependant on whether that sort of stuff sounds appealing to you, but even if it doesn't, I recommend checking it out simply because of how innovative the game's approach to freeform logic puzzling is.I should also mention as a sidenote how much I love the game's visual aesthetic/presentation. I've always been a fan of neofuturist-Asian settings, and this game's attempt at it fits it perfectly. It even complements the very gameplay of it as well: your job in the game is to create ultra-cheap microcontrollers for a near-future Shenzhen electronic market, so your goal isn't so much to make super fancy designs or something that's even relatively reliable, but rather to create something that just works and is cheap enough to ship without angering upper management."

HARD, but fantastic. :)As a real-life programmer, most of the time the code you are writing is easy, boring even. Sanitize user input and send it to the database. Made a dialog box appear when the user presses a button. There are fiddly bits for sure, but exciting problems tend to be pretty rare, because most of them are handled already by libraries written by someone else.And then you have Shenzhen, which is entirely interesting problems (except for the first couple of puzzles). Most of them seem straightforward until you start building the solution and... oh, I don't have enough ""simple"" outputs on one chip. Or just as often, you have a brilliant 15 line program, except you're only allowed 14 lines. Working within these constraints makes every challenge interesting.It's the sort of game where you will be eating breakfast the next day and suddenly have the solution to a problem that had stumped you. Or that a puzzle you had solved in a convoluted way can be solved simply with fewer components.Of course, you're not DONE when you have a solution. You have the Zachtronis histograms to compare how well you did with all other players, and especially your Steam friends. Discovering new techniques and then going back and applying them to past puzzles to try and beat your friends adds a lot to it, and is a nice break when you feel stuck on a later challenge.It's humorous and weird in the way Zachtronics games always are.

Shenzhen I/O is that game brought into a slight abstraction, a sort of coding putt-putt-golf.Reviewing this is a bit different from other games I might have played.Controls:There are no abstracted controls to praise or belittle.  You type.  You drag and drop.  If you are having trouble controlling the game, you're probably having hardware issues with your actual computer.Story:The story is minimal, but it's not really the point of the game.  It's a puzzle game.  If the goal were to tell a story, making the task so fiendishly difficult would be counterproductive.Music:The music is simple and fairly pleasant, but doesn't really impact the experience of the game heavily, as it might with a more story oriented game.  You can listen to it and enjoy it, or mute it and play your own.  It won't ruin your experience either way.Basically, if you like the idea of a puzzle game abstracting the life of a coder (in the same way a seek and find game is an abstraction of detective work) give it a go.

One task requests you to animate a neon sign, another to design a laser tag handler, and so on. You work on a board with a series of wires and microprocessors that tie into other devices like LEDS, Random Access Storage and so on, interconnected witih wires. To make some of the microprocessors work you have to use a programming language very similar to Assembler language which uses registers and accumulators in op code mneumomics. Completing these tasks advance a story of some sort, which is basically work life at a microelectronics company in China.Simple, yes?Not quite as simple as you may think. The board has limited space to work on and the pieces can only ""click"" in certain areas. You can't rotate them freely except maybe as a flip, and some pieces like a wire bridge do not rotate at all.  You can't overlap wires, though (as I just learned in the discussion area) you could run a wire UNDER a component.  When you complete the task, you get some feedback from the associated people and access to more functions (like the sandbox where you have a VERY generous work area to work on) and pieces become available.There's no tutorial, but you do not need it if you read the manual that is supplied. You don't need programming or microelectronic expertise, since you can ""dope"" out through experimentation on what the programming language and hardware does and how important it is to get all the pieces of your work to talk to each other within a ""tick"" or interval of time that passes. Timing really is important especially since you need to move data from one part to another, otherwise you may miss an event or worse lock the entire board up.This is a good game to play, and I highly recommend it for several reasons.The first is the sandbox itself once it unlocks. Once you unlock it, you can take a break from the tasks that advance the storyline and go play in the sandbox and make some pretty cool things that make noise, light up stuff, or display on a screen. Making a simple game with limited I/O interaction is not out of the question and can be fun.There's also that sense of accomplishment that you got a task solved and it gives your brain a workout. At 52 years old I'm looking for things that keep my middle aged grey matter active so I don't go senile. This game will definately do it but your head is going to hurt at times. Really. This is not some random shoot'm up game. You will need to use your brain but that does not mean it can't be fun.The one thing -- and I've mentioned this in the discussion forum ---- is that there should be no set limit on the size of the workspace. You should have a generous amount of room to come up with any solution and setting the size of the board to something that, in my opinion, limits the alternatives to finding a solution, especially since the tasks will get progressively harder and demand more pieces and wires. That one thing could be something that could put you off continuing with the game progression because it's going to pXss you off when you run out of room. I can come up with any solution but I need the space to do it. It's like trying to build a space shuttle in a closet.Again, do get the game, for the sandbox feature alone. It is pretty cool and you can do some neat stuff with it."

Many of the puzzles have animations tied to your output, so you can see how the machine that you are creating works while developing it. If I had any advice I would say read! the manual is part of the gaming experience, similar to the manual in tis-100 except way better done.

Shenzhen I/O tasks you with plonking down components on a board, connecting these using hand-drawn wires, and then writing the code for those components that function like mini-computers.In each level, you are given any number of inputs and outputs, and your tasks is to combine any number of components and your own code to produce the expected output, for example producing an alarm that turns on and off for as long as a trigger is active. Each of these levels are delivered in the form of email chains, in which your employers and collages at Shenzhen I/O tasks you with producing various components for the company, some serious (factory machine components) and some less so (controllers for a patriotic sandwich machine). The theme of the game is further helped by the manual included with the game, which is written entirely in-universe (excepting assembly in), and which is worthwhile to print and keep at your side as you play the game. The closely interwoven story-line is a nice improvement over the previous Zachtronic games, in which the story is typically much more light-weight.Similar to TIS-100, it appears that you do not have to solve all tasks to progress, though the exactly how this works is not clear from the game itself, and solving tasks is also associated with unlocking new components for you to use. I will also note that space is much more of a premium than in previous Zachtronic games, which greatly limits the kind of solutions you can create, and in some way, Shenzhen I/O feels more constrained than TIS-100.There is, however, little to actually complain about in Shenzhen I/O: Firstly, the unlock system used in this game means that I am not sure that I cannot reach some solutions because I'm not smart enough (the more likely answer), or because I need a part that I do not currently have. And secondly, the maximum simulation speed is much too slow, and results in unnecessary down-time, especially when trying out small incremental changes to improve performance. The game already allows you to place break-points and step through the simulation, so it is only rarely useful to watch the results in real time.All in all, Shenzhen I/O is a highly recommended, though it may take some commitment if you do not have previous programming experience."

,Recommended,504210,30967359,Posted: 5 April,all,HalfBurntToast,"In short, this is a great game, but probably not a game for everybody.I'm a huge fan of Zachtronics games. SpaceChem, TIS-100, and Infinifactory are some of my most favorite puzzle games of all time. That said, if you've never played a Zachtronics game, they are infamous for one thing: they are hard puzzle games. And I mean, REALLY hard. The kind of puzzles that make your brain feel like it's turning to mush. The kind of puzzles that stick around in the back of your mind for hours or even days when you're not playing, keeping you wondering “what am I missing” or “how else could I solve this.” And then, even after you've solved them, you want to go back and refine it as much as you can to make the most efficient solution.As with TIS-100, you're writing pseudo-assembly for fictional microcontrollers. But, instead of having a static 'game board' of microcontrollers, you're now free to arrange your own system using a variety of microcontrollers and other components. I'd say this is a pretty even exchange to TIS-100 in the sense that you're not restricted to a static board and you have freedom to move parts around which can reduce complexity and frustration. But, the catch is, now there are an innumerable number of ways to configure the board which can simultaneously add to the complexity of solving the puzzle.As with TIS-100, you're going to be programming at a fairly low level. Background knowledge of the general concepts of assembly language (regardless of architecture) will help, but only to a point. Those who haven't programmed before may very well feel overwhelmed and lost (though, it does start slow and offer a very detailed, yet blunt manual). That said, even people with programming experience will still need to review the manual and keep it handy to complete the missions. If that sounds like too much, I'd suggest going with Spacechem or Infinifactory (both are equally as difficult, but are more user friendly to non-progammers).But, if you're a programmer, engineer, computer science student, or anything related to that, and you enjoy the idea of solving brutal programming puzzles using a classic-looking opertaing manual, you'll love this game."

76561197964760822,Recommended,504210,34063523,Posted: 6 August,all,Roast,"Shenzhen I/O is a puzzle game that requires programming (a mock version of assembly language) to solve each level, with a level mechanic near identical to game developer Zachtronics's previous game, TIS-100. Shenzhen however is a more shiney, soulful version of its predecessor, which was based on a computer you discovered from the 1980s of which you unravell the previous (now mysteriously dead) owner's story. This game's situation is quite different in that your tasks are simply just your job. Shenzhen places you as a tech engineer who has moved to China, for some reason, working for a company called Shenzhen, where you log into a mock operating system with an e-mail inbox, with levels presented in the form of e-mail chains containing specifications to build circuits for. Amongst these e-mail chains are colleague banter which I can't say is particularly interesting or entertaining and would rather it was just 1 e-mail to get to the point, or better yet, no e-mails at all and just a task listing instead. The feel of an office environment for a puzzle game actually makes the goal of each task motivation seem as simply 'the company wants to make it' not 'you're solving a problem/puzzle'. The products you're building circuit boards for can be completely uninteresting, such as a sandwich maker and a fake haunted doll audio mechanism. These levels can take many hours, sometimes days to solve, and with the more dreary products at the end of it, it can be hard to press on.That being said, the puzzle solving itself is challenging, though requires a lot of patience. There's no hand-holding here, you're pretty much on your own. I find myself pacing around the room thinking of ways to approach things and some levels can go on for several days in my case. I can't say I have this amount of patience for any other game. It feels very rewarding when you complete a level successfully, that is until you are presented with an online score comparison at the end of each level. I hated this in TIS-100. To spend so long cracking a puzzle and to be shown that you've made a comparably inefficient product compared to the rest of the world can be annoyingly anti-climatic. How many of these players simply Googled the best method anyway? We'll never know but the score board doesn't care and there are the numbers right in your face every time. If you're a competitive person however, then you should be alright with this.Like TIS-100, there is a PDF manual to lay out all the syntax and special in-game devices that you need to know about. The syntax itself is very similar to TIS-100, however a couple of handy commands were removed, such as SWP, though a couple of new ones have been introduced. That being said the very basic language syntax made sense in TIS-100, which was based in the 80s, feels remarkably out of date for a game meant for the present day. You cannot enstate everyday programming features such as variables, methods, functions, proper looping techniques and arrays. The code often becomes spaghetti code with 'GOTO' style (JMP) commands that no programmer would even dream of using today, and 'IF' (TEQ etc.) style conditions that intertwine with each other due to a simple proceeding + or - that could actually be triggered by more than 1 conditional line. Things are quite limited, too, such as just 1 or 2 integer storage module per circuit to work with, limited lines of code available, limited room for circuits and wires on the panel, can all cause frustration and reduce creativity. In fairness however the developers can be appreciated that some limitations are necessary, or the puzzles would be too easy, but I feel that relying on language oddities to make the coding run more efficiently is all slightly unnerving.All in all the game is worth it if you're up for a challenge. This is not a fast-paced game and you have only your own brain to rely on. Much of your hair will be pulled, but can all be very rewarding once you crack a level. The player situation of a person simply doing their job is rather unappealing but can be overlooked to access a great experience. I'm 40 hours in and suspect I have at least 40 hours more until I reach (if ever) the end! This is definitely worth a go."

I did enjoy the game, but I simply cannot recommend it to anyone except the most hardcore fans of Zachtronics' other games. And Shenzhen I/O is the only Zachtronics game which I've had no desire to replay.My biggest complaint is the size of the boards. They are unfairly small.In Zach's other games, constantly adding and testing parts is how I would work my way through the logic of the puzzle, step by step. You could make a big messy solution at first, and then worry about optimizing it later. But Shenzhen I/O actively discourages you from playing this way, especially after the first campaign is over. There is simply not enough room on the later boards to reasonably work with.It's extremely frustrating when you have an idea for how to solve a puzzle, but you're too busy playing tetris with the chip pieces to implement it.I would spend so much time screwing around with chip and wire placements that I would lose my train of thought, and be unable to solve the puzzles within the game. I would have to turn the game off and go meticulously draw out a board plan on paper before even attempting to solve it again. This is just too much like real work to be fun.Another complaint I have is that compared to TIS-100, the instruction set for sending commands between chips is much less robust. TIS-100 had a ""Jump Relative Offset"" instruction, which meant all you had to do was tell the other chip what line to jump to in the code and it would run it. In Shenzhen I/O you can't do this. So you end up using much more code to accomplish the same thing, which quickly fills up the limited space within the chips, forcing you to add more and more chips, exacerbating the problem of the small board sizes.I feel Shenzhen I/O would be a much better game if the board sizes were bigger, or the chips smaller. Zach's other games had restrictions on solution sizes, sure. But not like this. Shenzhen I/O takes it too far. It's claustrophobic.Infinifactory and TIS-100 are two of my favorite games of all time. Infinifactory in particular I could recommend to anyone. But I can't recommend this unless you've already played TIS-100 to 100% completion and are aching for more."

You're tasked to make a bunch of small devices by hooking up a bunch of little microchips that can each only hold a few lines of assembly code, using a small non-standard instruction set. The way that you can tell specific lines of code whether or not to execute based on the result of the last comparison is a fun puzzley way to have to think about code, and it kinda reminds me of checking the status flags and branching appropriately when programming for the 6502 processor in oldschool machines like the NES and C64. It's not the same thing at all, but it really captures the puzzle-like feeling of trying to make things work on old hardware or tiny embedded systems and trying to optimize every last cycle. I wish this game was around when I was learning to program!"
,Recommended,504210,25955163,"Posted: 9 October, 2016",all,Frozen Ray,"tl;dr: 10/10 if you are a perfectionist who enjoys programming. Basically, a modern and shiny TIS-100, minus lonely/creepy part, plus the ""corporate atmosphere"" part.Basic gameplay: you get puzzles, you solve them, then you see some metrics for your solution, then you spend an hour trying to optimize stuff to beat everyone else.You can skip this part and just rush forward, but it's amazingly satisfying to find the solution that is better than your friend's solution.What makes this game unique compared to many other puzzle games (even the nerdy ones) is the anmosphere. You don't get a tutorial, you get a 40-page-long manual. Wild, unreliable, with some marketing BS (not the real one, it's just for the flavor) and the part of it is in Chinese (10/10 for realism), and you need to dig into it to solve your problems. You don't just get normal levels: you get emails that contain a lot more than just your task. You don't get just ""scores"" for the solution, you get the cost and energy consumption metrics that you are trying to minimize.Remember that time when programming was fun for you? If you do, try this game, it's totally worth it even in the current EA state. If you don't (or if you don't get it why some people go ecstatic after making their program 2% more optimal), than this game may not be for you, unfortunately. But you are totally encouraged to try: there are no ""frustrating"" parts that can make this game unaccessible if you are not familiar with programming.Game helps you everywhere it can (Ctrl+Z totally works, you can clone you solutions to fiddle with them without any risk of destroying the original, etc.), and it's unlikely that you will hit a brick wall that you can't overcome no matter what you do. It's always possible to make a ""terrible"" solution (slow and expensive), and revisit it later, when you'll get better (or unlock new elements). Yes, there is a progression system that unlocks new stuff as you go. You won't get immediately overhelmed with all these micro-controllers that you see on screenshots. Game has a very comfortable learning curve (at least so far, I haven't finished the EA version yet), and it's a lot more novice-friendly than TIS-100, for example. It doesn't mean that this game is ""shallow"" though. While I think that TIS-100 had a lot more room for optimizations (so you could spend more time on finding the best possible solution), these optimizations sometimese where quite exhausting if you was trying to minimize the runtime (you had to write a lot of code to make it marginally faster). Here the game uses different metrics that encourage you to write compact code, and this just feels nice. Best solutions don't feel ""bulky"". They feel ""clever"".The only complaint I have right now is that the information about other players' solutions is very unprecise (it's just a clunky histogram). I mean, the whole game is about optimizations, why can't I see if I found the best known solution or not? You do have precise metrics for your friends' solutions, though, which is nice."

The puzzles start off with medium difficulty, and requires the player to RTFM to get things to work. The assembly code that you write to allow your machines to function is fairly realistic and I love that the code is limited by the size of the module being used.  I found myself going back to earlier puzzles to try to achieve better performance of my designs as I got more familiar with the code.As a student studying CS at a university, this game mimics some of the course work I have done in the past, but in a far more enjoyable way. If you like puzzle games, coding or problem solving this game is well worth the $15 price tag."

It might look like a game at least partially about electronic engineering but it's really not. Yes you place down parts and connect them with wires but that's not where the challenge of this game comes from. Designing the circuit is easy because the space restricitions are very loose. The hard part is chosing the right parts and programming them with the fake assembly language the game provides.That being said, the game is really good at this. The level design is amazing and the difficulty curve is almost always just right. Except if you have no experience in programming whatsoever. In that case you will hit a crazy brick wall just in the first level. Instead of a tutorial, the game provides a manual which is written in-lore. While this is super charming and a very interesting challenge for experienced software developers, I feel this will be a nightmare to anyone without any experience in programming. That the manual is not doing a great job at explaining the assembly language at all, doesn't help obviously.Overall the game is really good and feels like a more polished version of TIS-100 while being different enough to not just feel like more of the same. While learning TIS-100 might be easier than learning SHENZHEN I/O, the difficulty curve is way more friendly in the latter.Overall it's great fun if you into this kind of stuff and I highly recommend it.A word on Early Access: The developer Zachtronics has an amazing track record on Early Access with Infinifactory and TIS-100. As the other two SHENZHEN I/O enters Eearly Access in a close-to-finished state already and if it follows its two predecessors, it will fully release in a couple of months with a little bit more polish and a bunch of extra content.If you want an even more in depth opinion and an introduction to the games mechanics, you can watch my video here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOa9Lq11F1k"

For people coming from TIS-100, here are the main differences:- A time unit lasts until you tell a controller to sleep. You must explicitly sleep. If you do not, you are sad and will not go to space today.- New flow control logic: Prefix instructions with + or - to have them enabled/disabled based on the last evaluated test.- Data can be transmitted in blocking digital form or as an analog signal (XBus or Simple I/O). Different chips work with different kinds of data transmissions.- Micro controllers come in two sizes, with specialized circuits (RAM, ROM, Multiplexer, Logic Gates, etc) unlocking later. You get to lay them all out on the board, and the cost of the components you use is one of the optimizable leaderboard options you can compete with your friends over.All in all: 10/10, will burn a hundred hours on this I'm sure."

I understand this is a concious decision on Zachtronics part, it'd be interesting to have different CPU architectures with more instructions (or even just more shorthand instructions like GEN).Overall, this game is an amazing follow up to TIS-100 and I can't wait to see what's to come!"

TIS-100 holds a special place for me as one of the best puzzle games ever, and if you can find a group of nerds to get competitive with the high score table then you can be prepared for a lot of late nights pouring over the technical manual.This is the natural evolution of TIS-100, you can now place a variety of modules, from the standard 9 line MC4000 to the opulent MC6000 (14 lines should be enough for everybody). The way the chips communicate now via the sleep cycles seems a bit clearer than it was in TIS-100. Solving the puzzles via the input/output plots is also fairly satisfying and provides a good interface to set breakpoints and visualize what is going on.The UI is very well polished and the game-within-a-game future-solitaire is even pretty good."

You get specifications in your inbox, and you generate designs, optimizing for different criteria as you see fit. As you would expect from a Zachtronics game, there's a histogram for each task showing where your solution sits vs the rest of the community.. plus a leaderboard showing where you sit vs your friends.So yeah, you place the parts and write the microcode. You match the test output. There's a way to step through and debug. The game is about what you'd expect if you've already played TIS-100. Same as there, optimizing your microcode is a little different from real-life parts.. In this game, for example, one mul by 4 is cheaper power-wise than using two adds. So real life experience doesn't always transfer to your ability in the game. (It's still going to appeal more to people who like assembly code, though. You really can't get around the need to be able to program.)This game requires a binder. You should have access to a printer to print out the pages to fill that binder (comes in a pdf).

If you like TIS-100 I would say this is worth picking up. If you weren't interested in TIS-100 or liked Infinifactory it's not similar enough to be worth purchasing. Infinifactory was very enjoyable to me as a puzzle game due to the visual aspect of building an end product and being able to see how the parts worked together in a 3D space. SHENZHEN just reminds me too much of work. I was hoping the interface being more visual in both output and design than TIS-100 would sway me but it just doesn't grab me as much as the Infinifactory puzzles. They click a lot better for me than the programming style puzzles do and I also find them much more rewarding to accomplish, something I didn't feel while playing SHENZHEN. SHENZHEN is a great Zachtronics product, but it isn't enough of a puzzle game to me as opposed to a work simulator to continue playing. I'm just not driven to keep solving puzzles like I was while playing Infinifactory. The soundtrack is amazing as always and deserves special mention as another excellent entry for this style of music."

Charging documents and video recordings released to the press indicate Cool Dad was instead arrested after a copy of Shenzhen Solitaire was discovered in his luggage.""It is important that we correct erroneous reports,"" stated Shigeru Miyazaki, Ministry of Justice spokesperson. The initial press release two days ago was the result of ""a regrettable translation error"" of a phrase more accurately translated as ""something far worse than amphetamines."" ""Amphetamine dependency is a treatable condition. Had Cool Dad only been in possession of amphetamines, he could have sought treatment,"" Miyazaki said, ""As this was not the case, it is important his fans understand the severity and danger of his crime.""Cool Dad's fans and detractors alike have been actively discussing the arrest on social media. Miyazaki presented as examples of rumors necessitating the press conference LikePics expressing bewilderment that the singer/songplayer was arrested and held without bail and TweetPosts alleging he was actually arrested for a conspiracy involving the murder of a music blogger.Shenzhen Solitaire is believed to have been first synthesized in Shenzhen, China and quickly spread worldwide over digital distribution platforms. Security experts are unsure whether it was created by organized crime or an enthusiastic amateur, but all agree its impact has been dramatic. Estimates place economic damages and lost productivity in the billions, with similarly dire health tolls. Electronics manufacturers are particularly badly affected, with tens of thousands of engineers ""completely unable to function"" according to the latest World Health Organization report. Over a dozen countries, including Japan, have outlawed the software outright in an attempt to curb its spread.There was no official statement on why the clarification was not issued sooner, but some legal experts believe it may have been due to pressure from Cool Dad's lawyers. ""Cool Dad is simply too Cool to be caught up in something like this,"" stated Hans ""OnlineLawyer"" Lawyermann, one of his on-retainer lawyers, ""It is unfortunate they can't keep their story straight. We're already writing songs sure to convince any jury.""Some foreign policy experts, however, argue the delay was due to a mild crisis involving Japan's relations with the newly formed nuclear power, the Meth States of America. Since it split from the United States of America three years ago, multiple diplomatic tensions have evolved over MSA's reactions to real and imagined slights, the most recent of which included a British MP's comments about the MSA's state motto, ""Tweaking so hard right now.""

It's more difficult than playing a 'normal' game, but the learning curve is quite good and (for me anyway) it's got a nice line where I'm on the edge of getting frustrated but then solve it, giving me a great sense of achievement! The only negative point I would say is that despite reading the manual there are some components that aren't explained there, and I think that if you're going to go to the trouble of writing a manual then you need to ensure it's complete.

I'd prefer proper conditional jumps and working with labels to having + and - prefixes for conditional executing of instructions (honestly is there any CPU that supports inline conditional execution?)Also the problems seem a bit more complex to begin with than in TIS100, which is nice.

I don't understand why they're using decimal instead of hex, for instance, or how the designer expects us to fit entire programs in 14 lines at the MOST.It's dumb.Where is the binary? Where are the basic operations such as shl/idiv? Seriously, you can't even divide values in this game. And since there's no floating point values (which makes sense in this case), you can't multiply by the inverse either.

It focuses more on practical applications of your skills over abstract algorithms, making gadgets and gizmos out of basic engineering building blocks like microcontrollers, multiplexers etc...  but at its core is the same sperge kryponite of obsessing over two metrics and how.. just HOW are my friends able to beat me by so much? WHAT IS GOING ON??!!One of the biggest changes over TIS-100 is the way that you gradually acquire new types of components as you complete various objectives. This allows you to go back to earlier puzzles and radically drop the power and cost of your solutions. This has the effect of driving you forward through the puzzles where in TIS-100 you might sit and obsess over one particular puzzle to try to match the par score or your friends' scores. There's no point until you've unlocked all the stuff. Move on. Get it working, then get it good.Brutally hard but this makes beating a puzzle all the sweeter."

It's all about writing very short assembly programs in a novel assembly language, on little processors which have wires to communicate with each other. The more you can optimize the code, the fewer processors you have to use (and often you need the space), so the game becomes much more of a puzzle than simply writing code.The game has a good level of difficulty, such that it's a reasonably difficult puzzle to complete each level without worrying about efficiency, but as your scores for number of parts and number of instructions executed are shared to the world and compared with the rest of the players, there's a drive to make your solutions as efficient as possible, which adds worlds more difficulty. If you're into that, you can spend half an hour just figuring out how to make part of your code one line shorter so that it fits into the memory of a single processor. Or you can give up and decide merely finishing the levels is enough for you.If you like programming puzzles or open-ended puzzle games with countless ways to reach a solution, this is one of the best such games I've played."

You develop random electronic gadgets and program the microcontrollers therein. For every puzzle only the specification and a limited playground is given. How and with which parts to solve the assignment is entirely your choice. And even if it might not be the best solution. You still can finish it. The real struggle comes with getting every last bit of performance out of your design. A thing you can spend hours on.If you ever are tired of solving puzzles or just want to do something else.

However, in this case the hardware is also designed by you by placing and linking components together. In this respect some aspects of SpaceChem are also brought into play here.Like almost Zachtronics games, there are a series of histogram benchmarks that you can use to rate your solutions against others. If you're into the competitive spirit, this adds a lot of replay value as you try to best or match your friends; it can also cause premature balding as you try to figure out how someone managed to accomplish a task with fewer instructions.Basically, if you're a fan of the genre (i.e. you're a fan of Zachtronic games) you're probably going to love the hell out of this thing.

And it looks like it's going to be replayable as well, considering that on some of the puzzles I went for a ""let's get this working and worry about getting a cheaper board next"".On top of that, the story, in-game emails and characters were pretty entertaining to follow, and having to refer to the documentation was surprisingly fun and immersive.The only drawback, I guess, is that it expects the player to either know (a very basic subset of) assembler or be ready to learn it -quickly, too, because it soon jumps into not-that-straightforward solutions.I'm definitely going to check the rest of these guys' games now.

Another part that makes this game so awesome is internal mails. The storyline in this game is about engineer from Europe who relocates to China and joins company that develop circuits. You receive new puzzles as emails within conversations with your colleagues and these email threads are super funny and awesome! Special thanks to occasional emails that give some insights about China and Shenzhen, I personally find them super interesting and very natural in this storyline.Here is some suggestions for improvements that came to my mind after some time playing.1. please make comments as part of the workplace, not as a separate module. I use this extensively for code drafts and snippets during problem solving and the fact that it is limited in space and consume space on the circuit is really frustrating. I believe that ordinary text field without any limitations and adjustable in visual size (so you can make it bigger or smaller depending on your needs) is much more natural and just make things more convenient without affecting gameplay2. I was really surprised that some pretty basic (in my opinion) modules are missing: like scale signal (multiply by constant), shift (add constant) or inverse (like 100-value) are missed. Yes, they make some of the first puzzles a little bit easier, but from my perspective these are very good basic primitives on top of which you can create some very interesting challenges.Anyway, thanks for a great game, really enjoying playing it! Hope to see more and more puzzles, new modules and may be even multi-circuit projects with interfaces between them!"

I've spent several hours staring at circuit boards before finally having an idea that actually works.All so a little bar moves to a part of a par graph- that I have a lot of confusion when reading- moves a bit more to the left.But a couple of my designs are the ""best possible solution"" as far as I can tell, so it was worth it.Though there's a couple that seem to say someone finished it with spare parts they had laying around, and spent almost nothing to produce the board. I don't know how those people did it.All in all, if you like puzzles, and spending a while thinking ""How can I make this thing be better than other people's things?"", it's the game for you.My favorite part so far was when I figured out I can actually write AND and OR statements."

When the game tells you 'Part not recommended' it's often 'lying' - if you know what you're doing you can often make a much cheaper and better design using the LC7 parts which burn no power.  Also, think really hard about what the + - test stuff can do.It's much more powerful than it appearsThis is basically a cross between TIS-100 and SpaceChem.  If you don't know those, then you're playing the part of a firmware engineer for a Chinese firm.  You get little projects and it's up to you to do board layout and programming of the microcontrollers (UC, tiny CPUs with I/O).  Challenge comes in because the board space is limited, the UCs are ridiculously limited, and you've got a metagame of minimizing your parts cost and power usage.The projects are fun - do an advertising display, do a drinking game scorer, do a fraudulent audiophile sound 'optimizer'.   They're doable chunks. And once you've got one working then you can copy it and try to improve it - the game doesn't require it, but you WANT to.The funny thing is that this is my day job as a firmware / board engineer and I still enjoy it because they're little bite sized fun things you can do and then you're done with them.  I also feel that if you're decent at this 'game' you would stand a decent shot at being a firmware engineer.  The most important thing is the problem solving mindset and a firm grasp of 'if (and only if) this,  then that' which most people don't have and will never learn.There is also a wickedly evil game for FreeCell, just because."

I believe it to be the best game of its type. There's a sandbox feature that can be unlocked and then you can make your own little inventions. It's very exciting when you figure out a puzzle.  Some of them are quite difficult and some (even later puzzles) aren't really that hard. The puzzles all have some practical application and a story behind them and I really appreciate that. That aspect was lacking from TIS-100.There is a leaderboard where you are compared to everyone else who has solved the puzzle. This brings up an interesting point - too many people seem to all have solved the puzzles in the same (usually very efficient) way. It's pretty obvious that a whole lot of people are cheating and looking up the answers. If you want to cheat maybe find another game. Cheating takes the whole point out of a programming game.The only really bad thing I could say about the game is that I think they tried too hard to make the game hard via making the electronics in the game really, really bad and the processors have very low memory. That's all kind of artificial but I suppose the alternative would have been to make the programming more difficult through harder algorithms and maybe people would complain about that too. I just wish it were possible to put more lines of code on each processor and/or use more processors and other components on a single design. That would be especially handy for the sandbox levels where you have no objective but to have fun."

I like the concept. I am looking for the same idea for topology, algebra and lambda calculus with the same way of material introduction. An interesting aspect from the teaching point of view, that either of these fields mentioned above is easy to comprehend and requires no special knowledge and prerequisites. For example, there is Rubik's cube and there is associated group, which defines the solution approach. It more like show the essence of the process, without evolving of formalisms and syntax. Introduction of more evolved theoremes would also be great to see in this application or in any other."

The difficult parts of this game is how to write the code within given line limits and how to optimize the cost and power. I give it a negative review at this moment simply because it always crashes for no reason on win10 os. Will change it to positive as long as the developers fix the bug.EDIT: It might be my laptop's issue, but if anyone has the same problem and knows how to fix it please tell me :)"

It's to TIS-100 what Infinifactory was to SpaceChem:vaguely similar, but more visual andfun. Overall this has grabbed me more than previous Zachtronics games have."

Shenzhen IO is quite simple to interact with (as long as you RTFM) but extremely hard to master, but once you master it the things that you could do become limitless, much like the rest of his puzzle games. Basically this game is TIS-100 but at it's full potentail.Pros:+Limitless potential to create+Light in terms of system requirements+Difficult and engauging puzzules+Interesting story+Best 100 games of solitaire I've ever playedCons:-A lot of reading-Inability to document your code in game-Loss of sanity when you can't solve a problem"
