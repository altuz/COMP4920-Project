I guess I need to practice to improve my skillsgets quite challenging. I love the fact that it has a score board and you can compete against your friends.only issue with that is that you have to wait until level 20 something to be able to participate.good board game nevertheless, great time waster :DLike it a lot I'm new 2 playing this but so far so good. I enjoy playing"

As you can see I have over 182 hours play time......There are a lot of good things about it and a lot of bad.Pros:Fun to playGreat time wasterBuilds up your clicking musclesOverall attraction is great when you first start outCons:-The game has a lot of bugs - i.e.  glitchy where I can't move food around - it just sticks there(The developers DID answer my query however want a screen shot or video which I can't give since the glitches are sporadic) - Update -- so far with the last update this hasn't happened anymore - this continues to be true -- only minor glitches on some of the missions)-Ratio of getting 3 stars is about impossible (stupid me  and I continue to be stupid - I keep playing the levels over and over again but just can't get 3 stars on levels past 30 on the 3rd, 4th and 5th restaurant)  Don't get me wrong I love a challenge however when it is unattainable it is just down right frustrating.Update:  Still an issue -- for me it is impossible to get 3 stars on the following:  I don't think it is possible in any combination -- to get beyone these....playing perfect games there isn't enough revenue to earn the 3 stars -- and on some of them only 1 star....the percentage above the goal needs to be lowered so that you can at least finish the game.Italian - last 3 levelsBakery - last 3 levelsJapanese - can not get 3 stars past level 24 -- and stuck on level 29 not even able to obtain 1 star-Achievements are broken:  Update -- (These have been fixed)  I have all but 2 achievements now:  This remains the same -- however I will more than likely never get the spinning wheel one since I detest that wheel, the sound is awful and it takes a full 30 seconds or more to complete one round...it just isn't fun or worthwhile....Played 1 hour straight - NO achievementUpgraded 5 restaurants completely - NO achievementGet 3 stars on 2nd Restaurant - NO achievement-The wait time is too short -- you burn a lot of food or have people just leave so you lose points -- no where to store food for later -- (it just goes in the bin and so does your score and putting them to sleep only lasts a very short time so you don't have time to catch up on the food) - Still an issue - wish there was a waste plate to sit food so you could give it out later without burning.-Spinning the wheel and trying to get diamonds -- the odds are stacked against you (this is also very boring...and long) - there is an achievement ""spin the wheel 15 times and lose""  everytime I get to 14 and then I win 1K or 2K. What's up with that when there are only 4 spaces in which you can actually win something.  Update:  they fixed this issue by unlocking the restaurants -- however if you run low on desserts you are going to have to spin the wheel.-There isn't enough ways to earn or buy diamonds which are the source of what you need (i,e, right now I have over 3 million in my bank and 43 diamonds) -- you have to grind away to earn XP for 1 lousy diamond or you can grind away at trying to better your score on the ""impossible"" levelsContinues to be valid on this update:  (This one has pretty much been resolved - hoever I do feel cheated in having to spend uneeded time in gathering diamonds to unlock resturants now that they are all unlocked from the get go).- Items are too small to see especially in the Chinese and Pizza Restaurants -- I haven't made it to the 6th one yet so I will let you know. (Finally made it to the 6th restaurant -- impossible to get even 2 stars even on the first mission) -- Requires too many diamonds to level up your items so that you can get better bonuses.  Not sure if I can hold out to get to the last restaurant but will let you know.  (Update:  the diamond issue has been resolved however the items are very small and there are way to many steps in preparing some of the dishes before you burn items or the customer leaves).Again I will continue to reserve positive and/or negative to see if the other  items get fixed....so for now I remain neutral (with this edit I will continue to remain neutral until I get a little further and see if any fixes come around)....A game like this should be fun to play -- not frustrating and impossible to reach goals having to grind away at the same levels trying to succeed.If you are a glutton for punishment as I am -- I can say that I have gotten my money's worth out of this game -- however the bills to the shrink for not being able to finish it will cost more...lolIn the interim I am going to continue to punish myself...."
,Not Recommended,504310,30064872,Posted: 20 February,all,JeanJeanJean,"This was originally a mobile game and was poorly ported to PC. It uses Diamonds as a currency which would work in a mobile version as IAPs. However in the premium PC version, after a few hours there are no ways to get extra Diamonds without some very hard grinding. You need diamonds to unlock new restaurants so you can't progress without them. There's also a daily reward for opening the game which makes no sense at all in a premium game. I paid my 10 euro and I expect to be able to play the entire game, not be drip fed it.I actually really enjoyed the gameplay and I was looking forward to unlocking the different restaurants, so I was extremely disappointed when I realised this awful design flaw. I requested a refund after 4 hours of playing, but if the developer fixes this issue I'd be happy to buy and play it again."

The gameplay is quite addictive, especially the multiplayer part where you compete with others for highest scores, which is called ""Chef on the go"". It has many restaurants with different cuisines, i am still at the first restaurant atm - the fast food restaurant.Decorating and upgrading the restaurants is very fun and helps you increase your leaderboards scores."

It seems like a good game but I'm just started to play the game.I will come back with more details soon.There's a reason the reviews are so positive and that this little indie game is so popular.

Offers a wide variety of dishes and you can actually learn a recipe or two from this. I can see this game becoming very popular with both women and boys since its educational but also a casual game that tests reflexes and stimulates high scores. becomes very addictive after a while. Will try to finish it and i will get back with me opinion after i play all 6 restaurants

76561198060574930,Not Recommended,504310,28909067,Posted: 1 January,all,pm006e7032,"Having bought this on sale, I would say that at that price it was fair value for money. It is a campaign based game - no free play - that requires movement through each mission stage to obtain cash, diamonds and XP, then eventual levelling up. After about level 17/18 in each restaurant, customers arrive thick and fast and it takes lots of concentration to achieve mission successes thereafter. This increases difficulty to such a degree that it easier to give up. This is the barrier to further enjoyment. It's cost me about 30p (UK) per hour (so cheap) but I won't be spending any more time on it. If you are very fast with your mouse and can multi-task, then go for it. Given the short playabilty time, I can't recommend it, but at the sale price, you could give it a go and not waste a fortune."

I've played over an hour straight and that achievement yet to unlock.  Plus its designed so later on you can't get 3 starts as you run out of customers.Besides these downfalls its not a bad game.  Unfortunatly the dev has stopped caring so I won't ever get those achievements which makes me one sad Gamey :(
