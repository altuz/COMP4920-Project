76561198112536267,Recommended,504370,25677877,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,Cloudwalker,"Just adding my Recommendation to the already overwhelmingly positive rating. I've played a lot of MOBA's out there, and this game eliminates everything I have ever thought frustrating about them. Instead of farming and item building and ganking and getting raged at, this game comes down to two things: You, and your ability to open a can of whoop♥♥♥♥♥THE COMMUNITYAs of now, this game also has an incredible community. Sure I've gotten literally 3 (I've been counting) ragers so far, but in almost 30 hours of play at 6-15min game times? That's pretty incredible. For the most part ""gg, wp, my bad, Hey duders let's try this strat, and NICE ONE MAN!"" are the only things you're going to see in chat, so if the toxic communities of MOBA's deters you, please do not hesitate to check this out. If I had to venture a guess as to why most people aren't jerks here it's probably a few things.1.) It's new. Simple.2.) It's pretty darn easy to see how you just got outplayed and lost and as long as you're trying to improve you'll notice.3.) It's entirely possible to 1v2 or even 1v3 if you've got dem mad skillzTHE GAMEPLAYDon't let the naysayers fool you, this game is very balanced. You DO have to change strats depending upon whom it is you're facing. I've had moments where I was like ""what the heck, Pearl can outheal 2 dps? Cooomon."" But then you take a look at the Battlerites you pick prior to the games startup. Do you need some extra damage? There's a battlerite for that to combat the boosted heal battlerite they just picked. Do you need some extra mobility to keep yourself alive while being hunted by their dps and tank? There's a battlerite for that. Do you need some extra Utility for the tossup? There's a<App>Battlerite for that. Matches are also much shorter than your typical MOBA. Think Rocket League for MOBA's. Pick it up, play a match for 10min and put it back down.....before you'd get through champ select in League.THE PRESENTATION/GRAPHICSLook I'll be real here, it's new, so it's not going to be as flashy as say DOTA 2 or LoL or HoTS. However, the Graphics are solid. (As I'm sure you can see, think WoW.) The character customization is also more extensive than most other mobas and is not hidden behind a paywall. (Think the reward system of Overwatch.) The only negative thing I will say here is that the music is nothing to write home about. It is pretty bland and generic, but then again I've never had the inclination to jam out to any other MOBA or Overwatch for that matter. Open up that Spotify account. Problem solved.THE ODEUM:(Credit to Ansvar for reminding me.)Battlerite features a sort of replay compendium called The Odeum which allows you to edit, view and post to the Battlerite community any awesome replay footage you might have or wish to see. You can search by user or browse a long list of upvoted plays. You can also view your own matches from a long list. This is especially helpful to those who wish to improve, as it allows you to critique yourself. It's also a nifty tool in case you want to prove you really did just 1v3 with that can of whoop♥♥♥♥♥mentioned earlier.OVERALL:I hope this game becomes the next big thing. The next League or CS: GO. It deserves it. It's worth the asking price just to support the devs who listen to their community and just genuinely care about their game. This game eliminates all the gripes I've ever had about MOBA's and then some. Some I didn't even realize I had before playing this. Supporting the devs or no, give this is a look at least when it's f2p and I'll see you in the stadium.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION:Please check out the comment section of this review as I answer some of the questions asked by the community!"

If you like MOBAs but don't like the last hitting, slow early game, and lane pushing, you will love this game. It's basically a constant team fight, 2v2s or 3v3s. I find that 2v2s is where the game really shines. Very tactical, high skill ceiling, and the variety of champs/heros is great (although there are only 15 at the moment). Looking forward to future updates. The next one should is dropping at the end of October. The game differs from most MOBAs in that it has WASD controls with mouse aiming.The game will eventually be free to play, adopting a similar strategy to League of Legends (selling cosmetic items and unlocking champs with earned in-game currency.) But if you buy now, all future champs will be unlocked right away. You can unlock cosmetic items right now through chest drops you can earn via the in-game currency by playing. There aren't and will be no pay to win elements.For an early acess game it is very stable. I have had no issues with lag, bugs, or anything similar."

The spiritual successor to ""Bloodline Champions"" with more polish and accessibility, Battlerite is ""a combination of top-down shooter and fast paced fighting game played with WASD movement and cursor based aiming. Battlerite is all about skillshots, teamplay and fast reactions"".Games are usually 7-12m long, and jump right into fast paced, skill based 2v2 and 3v3 arena combat. There are no pay to win elements, lots of unique champions with different playstyles, and deep and rewarding combat. My only warning is that you will find yourself saying ""One more game"" until the sun comes up, as the intense and skill based combat keeps you constantly craving for more."
,Recommended,504370,25634194,"Posted: 22 September, 2016",all,ModestLunatic,"So, this game is by Stunlock Studios, the folks behind Bloodline Champions. BLC is (was, I suppose) one of my favorite games of all time. It's one of the only online multiplayer games to actually get me to compete so intensely, to really desire to improve.BLC was a powerful combination of absolute skill based aiming, (even for melee attacks) fast paced gameplay, varied and pretty well balanced champions to play, and a heaping helping of SKILL CAP. The best BLC players were insanely better than even a pretty good player, but the magic was that they were using the same toolkit as somebody that had just started playing. That last bit wasn't true near the end of BLCs life, but I try to forget those times.Sorry, this isn't entirely on topic. Battlerite is not BLC, but Battlerite is the spiritual sequel to BLC, and it's my current hope that Battlerite gets popular enough to raise it to heights BLC never reached.Battlerite continues the charm of Stunlock's weird tribal art, absolute skill based aiming for every attack, and potentially blisteringly fast combat.They're attempting innovation with the ""Battlerite"" system, the ability to choose an enhancement for your champion after each round, up to 5 enhancements with 1 out of 3 per turn.How they balance their new Battlerite system will likely be key to if this game can usurp the glory days of BLC, but rest assured, I'll be there for this games future.Thanks for reading my disorganized rant! I'm bad at reviews. This game's future is important to me, so even if my writing is scattered, I want to voice my positivity for this game. It really is good, blind nostagia aside. It's extremely polished and fun for an Early Access game, and has managed to scratch that  BLC itch of mine that has been plaguing me for ages.Oh, and if you play and enjoy the game, please remember to give them feedback, as it is a beta, and remember to spread the word about the game as well. Battlerite is quite unique, so it shouldn't be too hard to sell some people on it."
76561197990807422,Recommended,504370,25726471,"Posted: 27 September, 2016",all,𝓦eedzy,"Weedzy's Stoned ReviewsBattlerite succeeded in capturing my attention through its meticulously crafted visuals, gameplay and graphics, not to mention the lovely soundtracks that you hear during the fights.First, I was skeptical about buying the game due to the fact that I've never actually played this kind of genre: fast paced MOBA arena style game without turrets? Sounds kind of scary to purchase such a product but you shouldn't be afraid because it can only offer you tons of fun and it will surely satisfy your gaming needs especially if you decide to get out of your DOTA/LOL comfort zone and try something new.The first moment I ran the game I was surprised by the looks of the UI and the menu of the game, for an early access game, I thought it would look bad, fortunately the devs nailed it with this as well. The game is easy to learn if you step through the tutorial first, in which you can see some good voice-acting and cute mini-cutscenes. After you finish the tutorial, the game will reward you from there on with other daily quests and I can state that it really has a well thought rewarding system for the player. It also contains chests that you can unlock by completing quests or by leveling up your favourite heroes, those chests offer you common, rare or epic skins for your fighter and his weapons, I almost forgot about this: you can also get skins for MOUNTS ! Mounts?! amiright?!In terms of performance, it works great on maximum settings for my barely high-end PC and I don't really see anyone complaining about performance or buggs in-game.To be honest, I didn't want to buy this game because I knew the developers would release it as a F2P game, and this is a reason why I was skeptical at first and maybe many others are because of this, however, this game really succeded to amaze me by how good it was developed, from any point of view. If you purchase the game in the EA state, you help the developers to continue to add more features by having more funds for this beautiful product and they also reward you by giving you all the present and future heroes that will be added in the game for free,FOREVER, even the heroes added after the game leaves Early Access, without having to unlock them through gameplay or by in-game currency.I truly recommend this game for all kind of audience, even if you don't like this kind of genre, it will sure get to you and eventually you will F***ing love it!"

,Recommended,504370,25681903,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,PrimaGoosa,"*** Long Review, apologies in advance.  TL;DR - I'm so happy it's back and in good form.  ***When I saw they were releasing a BLC clone, I was skeptical at first.  I already had to watch one of my favorite games die once, and I really didn't want to watch it happen again.After playing a slew of matches today, I'm incredibly impressed with how they improved (in my opinion) on the formula.* All champions unlocked.  I feel like this is crucial for new MOBAs these days, and I feel like going with a Hearthstone-esque implementation of reward is really going to help.  It sucks being limited to 4 of 16 champions and feeling gated behind a paywall.  Now you have everything available, and you can dump money into chests for cosmetics if you want.  Now cosmetics are random, but I feel like that's OK.EDIT - I'm not 100% sure this is how the game will be when it's F2P, and if it is, I hope they have a paid package that is just the same roughly $20 for all champions unlocked forever.  I really don't like champion gating, though I also come from DOTA, so it's a foreign and unwanted concept.* Daily quests for chests.  I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I love this sort of thing on queued games.  It gives you a reason to experiment with other champions, giving you something to work toward and play the game without fussing over only rating, or some stat-based progression.* The Battlerites.  Even though I seem to always choose the same ones, that's probably just because I have a specific playstyle.  I love the little flavor these add to the game.* Simplified Roles:  Support, Melee, Ranged.  No more tank, no more healer.  Support has a heal, but it's on a cooldown instead of being spammable.  In my opinion, this means they have to be more clutch, less spam.* You face where your mouse points, not where you are WASDing.  I don't know if there's back attack modifiers in this game, but this just feels a lot cleaner.  Maybe it made the game more professional before, but I like this change.* Arena design.  Maybe I'm forgetting, but I feel like old BLC arenas were mostly open area, with maybe a couple LoS opportunities in one or two of them on the sides.  Battlerite feels, by and large, like a smaller central area with more juking potential, which is good because you often want to be interacting with that environment.  Which brings me to* Environment interaction.  Receiving additional benefits when capitalizing on positioning feels really good, and I think adds to the flow of the game.* Cracking the energy ball to receive the boost.  I like the strategy this adds to a fight, since you don't just run in and get free energy.  You can make big plays off of a team you know is going to huddle as soon as it pops (which might not be the best players on the team, but you won't always be in top tier gaming).* Health/energy pickups around the arena.  I haven't programmed myself to look for these yet, but with the reduced amount of spammed healing available, these really help you sustain if you pay attention.  Gives it a bit more of an FPS arena feel, and I really like that.* Performance.  This game runs smoothly (on low, mind you) on my 4 year old gaming laptop.  It can't run most games these days, but it can run Battlerite, and that makes me incredibly happy.Cons?  I hate only showering a game with praise, but I haven't seen any balance issues of yet.  Part of that is because I don't fully know all of the new nuances of each champion, and I'm not going to jump to conclusions.  Everything has felt manageable so far as long as I don't waste my toolset.  If I die, I often did something dumb.  If I'm out of position, again, I misplayed.It's almost exactly what I wanted out of a BLC reboot.  Plays incredibly smoothly, feels great, insanely fun.  And *somehow*, I have yet to run into a poor attitude. Everyone has been nice so far.  Maybe it's the thrill of having this sort of game back in the mix, but I've made some doozie mistakes, and still when I'm like ""Sorry about that"", it's ""np"".  And if you don't want to hear a tirade, you can completely disable chat.I thought of a con:* No scenarios.  I lived for BLC scenarios back when people queued for them.  The additional objectives made it feel more engaging for me than just an arena brawler, but I understand that they are refining their focus this time around.  If Scenarios are released in the future, I'm going to scream like a school girl at a One Direction concert.  If not, this game is still incredible.If you loved BLC, pick up this game right now.If you stopped playing BLC because of the progression garbage added to the game and the money grab that is champion pool availability lottery, pick up this game because there is none of that (and I hope that stays, even for newly released champions).If you have no idea what BLC is but you are hesitant because of DOTA and LoL, keep an eye on this game.  Watch some videos, read more reviews, and understand that it is not those games.  No 60 minutes slow downhill farming loss.  No intense vitriol for minutes on end because everyone is stuck in a losing scenario and can't get out.  You play games that are often just 5+ minutes long, and if there's frustration, odds are you won't see that person again anyway.Great game.  Love that it's back."

,Recommended,504370,32859280,Posted: 27 June,all,NEQSIS,"What is Battlerite?Battlerite is a hybrid somewhere between Dota 2 and World of Warcraft style Battlegrounds - you take on opponents in 2v2 and 3v3 arena-style skirmishes and try to be the last team standing (after a best of 5 match).  From Dota 2 it borrows maticulous hero balance, movement/camera mechanics, and a handful of thought-out abilities for each playable character.  From WoW Battlegrounds it borrows a focus on pure PvP; there are no objectives here other than defeat your opponent.  What is unique to Battlerite is the major importance of movement; I've found quick reaction time and mobility to be one of the most necessary skills to succeed here in order to dodge enemy attacks, zone enemy teams/players, and land powerful abilities.GameplayGameplay is fast, fluid, and has an incredibly high skill ceiling that rewards practice, hero/ability knowledge, and mechanical ability.  The devs are constantly tweaking, balancing, and updating this game which has consistently received excellent support.Dev Support / Early AccessBattlerite is currently (as of June 27, 2017) an Early Access title, but don't let that deter you. Battlerite is one of the most well-developed and supported games I've ever played in early access and I'm often highly critical of the early access model.  Note that, while the game is available for purchase during early access, it will be free when it hits release.  You hear ""free-to-play"" and immediately have fears of ""pay-to-win""? You (probably) don't. While the exact model of the F2P release are somewhat unclear, at worst, it will function like League of Legends; starting with a limited pool of champions requiring you to either play (or pay) to unlock more, and any other purchases being cosmetics. Note that any Early Access purchasers will have all current and future champions unlocked.Verdict:Idefinitely recommend, 7.5/10anyone with interest in this game (or players of Dota 2 or WoW Battlegrounds) to pick it up when it goes free upon release.  If the game seems like something you're particularly interested in, it's worth the $20 non-sale price; but on sale (or when free to play) its an even better buy.  My only major concern with the title, in addition to some questions about the F2P model, is the small player-base. While you won't have trouble finding games quickly you'll an average 3,000 players online at a time and see repeat players often.  Hopefully more will be playing when it goes free!"

While it has its pros and cons, Battlerite overall is a great game that is well on the way towards its ideal ""perfect"" state for its Free-To-Play launch. Please keep in mind that this review is based off of my opinions, and my views on the state of the game as a high diamond player.Pros:-Amazing gameplay-Intuitive mechanics-High skill cap-Effective counterplay for most scenarios-Polished game, no-low FPS lag-Clean and easy to distinguish what is happening-Large and continuously expanding character roster-Few cheaters/hackers-Cool cosmetics-Decently frequent updates-Extremely absorbing and addicting-Easy-to-enter tournaments-No snowballing (Always room for comeback)-100% skill and strategy, if you lose, you got outplayed. Maybe a matchup was unfavorable, but you personally could have played better.-Huge update coming soon (new gamemodes woot)-Odeum (playback games and post big plays, like an in-game instagram for sick outplays)-Very few bugs/glitchesCons:-Some characters are sometimes a bit too strong/meta-Small player base (Perhaps the biggest con, while the playerbase is good, matchmaking can sometimes feel way too long for a short 2v2 brawl.)-Ranking system (Recently got a change, and is a bit better, but still has tons of room for improvement)-Dev focus (Sometimes, it seems that the Devs are more excited to push out new cosmetics than improve balance or matchmaking)-Matchmaking (I still dont understand why I play with a bronzie against 2 Champions every now and then)These are most of the pros/cons I can think of off the top of my head, but overall this game is very fun and well made. Do keep in mind that Battlerite is still in early access, meaning not everything is perfect yet, but hopefully will be by the time of its full release. For $20, you get to play this awesome game many months earlier than the people waiting for F2P, as well as unlocking the full character cast (which means you dont have to grind up to buy characters). I highly reccomend this game to anyone who is at least a bit interested in it/anyone who enjoys MOBAs (Ex: LOL, Dota 2, HOTS, Smite), and give it my rating of 9/10. The Devs have room for improvement, but have already succeeded in making a kickass game for us to enjoy.See you in the arena. -Nevasha"

It means that theres a lot things to make the game even better- I watched the second video in the store page, was hoping to see it in-game, but no. Ok so i think that ""Highlight"" should be replacing ""Pose"" each rounds, and ""Pose"" should be only at the end of the match- BE CAREFUL with 2v2 and 3v3 matchmaking, its RANKED game- The 3v3 matchmaking is not good right now, the MMR system is not balance, at least for me- Game got heroes that are too OP. For me its Jade. She got invis, dodge, silent, stun. Crazy damage. What.- Expensive skin is not worth buying. I think that kind of price is not worth for just a colour customized skin.

There are no lanes, there is no farming, there are no items, there is no 50 minutes of positioning and planning, revolving around the occasional burst of action.Instead, this game is strictly those action parts. You slide down a gigantic suspended platform, the gates drop, and you burst into a small arena with a few walls and it's just you, your ally, two enemies, and you all want each other dead. It's snappy, everything feels responsive, and you have to land skillshots and make rapid decisions in a best of 5.This doesn't have the gigantic learning curve of DotA, where you're stuck wondering how to build your hero and select items and where to farm and how to cover the map. It's more like learning Smash Brothers: There's some combos you could learn, there's plenty of tech to learn so you feel yourself improving over time, and it's more about (quickly) learning how your and other champions behave. The meat of the gameplay comes down to coordinating with your teammates: there's huge rewards for proper positioning, cc chains, etc.All the core gameplay components have been laid out perfectly, and Stunlock's already laid out hints and teasers at plenty of new maps and heroes in the pipeline. As long as it can get some extra support in the form of tournaments and a better UI, I think this game has a bright and healthy future. Highly recommend trying it out, triply so if you've got a friend to play it with you!"

Whether or not there are issues with these features and if they are important or not is up to each player to decide. Let's therefore put them aside for now.Battlerite's gameplay is very appealing. It's fairly fast, reactions from your character are almost immediate and there is no luck involved in the damage your attacks will do. Ultimately, what will decide the outcome of combat is your mastery of every facet of Battlerite's gameplay compared to your opponents. However, although the above both sounds and plays well for what might be a long time, it is eventually replaced by something hollow.Truth be told, Battlerite is a very unrewarding experience. You play your best and attempt to master the avenues for skill that the game provides you with. But those avenues are not deep enough. More importantly, they are not very satisfying to improve at. Many (but not all) issues stem from the central gameplay tenet of cooldown management. Every character has one attack ability with no cooldown alongside 8 other abilities that either do have a cooldown or are restricted in their use by a limited resource. This means that choosing when to use these gated abilities becomes of utmost importance in order to win a match.What tends to happen is a game of cooldown skill trading. I use an ability to either escape, do damage or control my opponent somehow. In response, the enemy player will do the same. We now both lack an ability, but because we both desire to gain an advantage we will use another pair of abilities. And another. This exchange keeps going until both players have exhausted all options but to hit each other with their non-cooldown based attacks. As a gated ability once again becomes available, the chain of skill trading resumes.There is indeed a good amount of things for the player to learn in this area. Managing to gain a small edge over your opponent due to better choice of abilities to use or coordinating with your ally to avoid enemy abilities without having to use one of your own are two examples. But it is not very gratifying. It is not enough to keep a firm grip of your interest. The reasons for this are several, but the most egregious one is that the game does not easily allow you to play better than your opponent without the use of cooldown restricted abilities. A combination of not easily being able to evade your opponents attacks and being unable to deal meaningful damage lies behind this.Due to space restrictions I have only been able to cover one aspect of gameplay in this review, but it is perhaps the most important one to consider. Battlerite does indeed require skill and intelligence to play well, but the reward you recieve in exchange for the time you spend is not fulfilling. The things the game ask of you are not satisfying enough to master - playing around them is not as enjoyable as it should be."

My history is DOTA, HoN, BLC, LoL, DOTA 2, SMITE, HOTS, Dawngate (RIP you will never be forgotten). Now, the important thing to note here is that throughout my time of playing MOBA's there was one game that I always went back to and it was Bloodline Champions. That game single handedly delivered everything you wanted from a MOBA. It had unique character designs and fun skills. It rewarded you for being good at the game and not for being lucky, it removed the tedious work of having to go into lanes and farming in order to gain an advantage (which has its own benefits I'm not discrediting it as a game mechanic) and if you're anything like me, you want an action packed game that delivers intense, challenging, and rewarding gameplay immediately. Stunlock Studios accomplished this with Bloodline Champions—AND SOMEHOW THEY MADE IT BETTER IN BATTLERITE!!! This game is challenging, intense, and fun. It has small nuances that make it strategic and rewarding if you're good at the game.Also, it's easy to pick up, but difficult to master, play it with friends, play it a lot, lets make this game into something incredible by giving it a sustainable player base, because I assure you all, if youi love esports, this game will be so unbeilevably hype further down the lines its going to be awesome.

,Recommended,504370,31203119,Posted: 17 April,all,Cambin,"*Update Edit* - A lot of negative reviews about 'stale development'. While it's been slow, it's Early Access so patience is required. Just today they announced the roadmap and F2P launch of 11/8. Please go read the ""Battlerite New Era"" news / update. Big things are coming for this game over the next few months, finally!The spiritual successor to Bloodline Champions, this game is a MOBA but not like League of Legends or SMITE. In Battlerite, you're pitted in an arena in a 2v2 or 3v3 setting and you battle it out until the last team, or person is standing. First team to win 3 takes the cake.The heroes are fun and many are challenging to learn and master. I can safely say that this is my favorite style of MOBA since there is no slow period of gameplay. You don't farm minions or lanes or gold. Your objective is to kill Poloma as fast as possible.I'm not the most skilled player in the world, but hitting skill shots feels extremely satisfying, especially when it's an Ultimate that results in a double kill or a clutch game 7 win. For $20 (was $14 during earlier EA) as an all-in price (includes all heroes, forever), there is no additional cost unless you want cosmetic items via the annoying trend of loot box roulette. You do earn plenty of chests via daily quests, leveling, etc... though so don't fret.As long as the playerbase holds up (my only real concern anymore), this game should stay relevant and fun. The studio is great at communicating updates and changes, which goes a long way with an ""Early Access"" tag. Though I would safely say this game doesn't feel like it is in EA anymore, so don't let that tag scare you.TLDR; Do you like MOBA's but don't care to farm minions? Do you enjoy team fights or duels? Do you enjoy having a good selection of heroes that feel unique and challenging? If yes to any of that, then give Battlerite a couple hours of effort.P.S. Shift key = EX ability modifier.8/10 - Very satisfying."

I'm so happy I bought it during early access for all the new characters I'll be getting permanently once the game launches and goes free-to-play, and I'm so happy I supported the developer.I live in India, and have around 150-250 ping to EU and NA. The developers have got a server in India, and a few more in Asia, which allows me to play with low ping and have a great time. The game is very well crafted and smooth, especially for an early-access title. It feels like it's already fully released.The gameplay is super fun, despite being difficult, I absolutely love it.

This game takes a lot of skill and knowledge to be competitive at a top level. Anyone can jump in and enjoy themselves. Don't get discouraged if you get owned for a day or two until you learn your champion and learn the other champions. Stick with it and find some people around your grade to play with.The only con I can think of is there is no unranked game mode. Which I totally understand. They don't want the player base to be split between several Qs. So if you get ranked anxiety like I do.. Just have to go in with the mindset that you WILL get better and will climb the ranks in time.

There is a very high skill cap.There are many champions, all having very unique abilities and roles. The champions are well balanced against each other.Between each round you can pick battlerites, which are bonuses for your hero’s abilities.

A lot has already been updated and added in the few months this game has been out.  Thus even if the game was released right now (Decemner'16), it will feel and play like a full release game.Since the classic MOBAs (Dota2&LoL) hit the gaming scene, I was really hooked by the action based team-fights, I loved the skill-shots and the dodging, but really disliked everything else, Battlerite satisfies this hunger for epic team-fights and indepth combat. Those are achieved by picking one of  over 17 unique characters, which you bring to a small arena in a 2v2 or 3v3 death match. In a best of 5, lasting between 5 to 12 minutes, thereby removing the long time commitment and with it a lot of frustration.Exactly like the classic MOBAs, this game is played top-down and uses the fog of war really well, thus giving you, the player a lot of vision (more than dota2), to easily hit your abilities. Every character has a set of skills, but this game has more skills, in fact 9 skills per character. Usually one of these skills is a dodge skill, creating a lot of epic moments in 1v2 or 1v3 combacks. Although there are four powerful skills, that require energy, which is gained by using abilities and collecting energy on the map. One of skills often referred to as the Ultimate ability requires 100% energy, while the other skills requires only 25% of the energy, so a player always has to think about whether they want to wait for the Ultimate or if they rather use a skill now to get an advantage over the enemy.What I really like about the abilities is that the majority of them have some kind of debuff effect on the enemy or buff effect on you, by that giving every player great utility winning 1v2 fights. This utility can be further enhanced by the Battlerite upgrades you gain at the beginning of every round, but there are also some heal and damage options.So in conclusion the game is great. If the game is more fleshed out. I think this game will be worth playing once it's out as a Free-To-Play game. Or if you really want to try out the great gameplay and want to play with non-free-to-players, just get it now, the gameplay is already so good and satisfying.Note -> The game costs $US20 right now which giving access to all current and future characters, but will go free to play in the future."

Battlerite builds upon its spiritual ancestor, Bloodline Champions, by introducing a wider variety of characters, ranked matchmaking modes, and a more polished gameplay experience.This game is aimed towards the competitive gamer with both its high skill floor and ceiling. Many have compared this game to WoW arenas due to the fact that hardcore PvP is at the heart of Battlerite. However, the true crux of this game is closely coordinating with your teammates; as such, enjoying this game to its maximum potential relies on having friends to play with over comms. Unfortunately, there is no voice chat in-game and the matches are much too quick to attempt to coordinate over text.Nevertheless, Battlerite is action-packed and highly satisfying, with a great amount of replayability. At the modest price of $20, the game is well worth it considering that early adopters will never have locked future content when the game goes free-to-play, set for sometime next spring.

No bushes. No level ups. Just straight Multiplayer Online Battle Arena.The game features Casual/Ranked 2v2/3v3, Private Matches with a few custom options, Play vs AIs for your Daily Quests needs when you're lazy and a Playground where you can go test the skills and battlerites of any Champions. The Playground is very important and everyone that plays this game should visit this place every so often, especially the newer players, so they can get a quick feeling of everyone's skills. As for ranked, ranks are split between solo and the different teams you play with. That means that you could be Gold 2 solo, but Diamond 5 with Bob, and Platinum 6 with Bob and Martin.Matches are best 3 of out 5 rounds(around 8 to 12 minutes per match). Each round, the game gives you 3 pre-determined Battlerites, depending on the current round, to choose from(2 on round 5, for your ultimate). Battlerites slightly alter one of your skills. While certain choices look very strong on paper, it doesn't mean it will be your best option agaisnt your current opponents.The game currently features 21 Champions split through 3 categories: 7 Melees, 7 Rangeds, 7 Supports. While some Champions share similar skill mechanics, they feel different to play due to the rest of their skill kits.Recently, they added Campaign, which is just an extended Tutorial. The name chosen aside, it does a great job at explaining everything you need to know before you start playing agaisnt humans. Now players that go through the Campaign will know what EX-Skills are.The game is meant to go Free to Play later on, but if you buy it right now, you will gain access to all Champions and future released Champions.The game also has a DLC that isn't listed on the store page. While the value of the Ultimate Fan Pack is often argued about, if you have spare money and want to support Stunlock Studio further, you can get some exclusive things. Buying the Ultimate Fan Pack gives you the Battle Wolf mount, the Goblin Throne mount and Permanent 10% EXP gain for the price of 30$ USD/33$ CDN. Personally, I value the Ultimate Fan Pack more than buying Gold Chests, because over time, assuming you play the game, you will be able to get a lot of the cosmetics through Silver Chests and weekly Gold Chests."

My friends and I came to this after playing league of legends seriously for over 3 years; it takes all of the mundane parts of LoL out of the equation, like csing, leveling up, warding, but keeps the best parts of team fighting and objective control. Games are significantly shorter, more action packed, and more fulfilling. And with shorter games come shorter queue times. I bought the game after playing just a few hours.Battlerite just needs a bit more traction to grow its player base. Join with your friends.The rotating game mode is a great idea.

Unfortunately, in most MOBAs, that makes up only about 20% of the actual game. The rest is frustrating slog.Battlerite basically distills down the best parts of MOBAs and cuts away all the fat. Just super fast-paced, skill-based teamfights that don't take forever.As someone who plays a lot of games simultaneously, it's also refreshingly easy to come back to. It doesn't have weird, obscure skills that require constant upkeep (like last-hitting in many MOBAs) or require an up-to-date encyclopedic knowlege of items or character builds. Most of the characters in Battlerite seem to follow a relatively similar formula for the way their abilities are set up, as well. I don't feel like I've forgotten how to play when I pick it up after a lengthy absense.I highly recommend it if you're someone who loves the memorable moments that come from awesome plays in MOBAs, but you find most MOBAs to be convoluted slogs that take too long and fill you with frustration."

They continue to monotize skins and other pointless trash while listening to the absolute WORST section of the player base on balance issues.  The game is continuously being balanced around the premise that the players that have the least amount of skill should be granted the loudest voice.  Thus far this has ruined more than one character in the name of ""balancing"" the game so that people that have barely dipped their toes into gold ELO are dictating which characters should and shouldn't be viable.The game has a solid framework but it has a serious healer problem (i.e. healers are absurdly strong relative to the majority of the roster). Couple that with the fact that it was supposed to go FTP literally months ago you have a nearly dead player base while the remaining bottom half of those left act like a bunch of petulant children that whine about things they can't figure out counters to and so SLS nerfs them into non-viability.The cherry on the s*** sunday is the fact that the game has ZERO anti-cheating measure implemented.  It's fun watching Jumong and Varesh blind-poke over walls all day when you change direction five times and they still catch you in the center of every AoE ability they throw.So much wasted potential in this title.  Save your money, go play another MOBA.  If they can't figure out how to balance a roster this small without nerfing anything that makes scrubs salty then this game is doomed."

I've played various MOBAS such as HoN/LoL and DOTA 2 but they never managed to keep my interest for very long? The reasons? Extended time of farming required before the real action starts, an early mess-up can turn the match into a complete stomp just a few minutes into the match if you died at the hands of a strong hero and horribly long matchtimes to name a few.That is why Battlerite feels like the perfect MOBA to me, even though it's technically not a MOBA but whatever. The fact that you do not need to farm or purchase items was what caught my interest at first and I decided to try it out. The controls are vastly different from your regular MOBA since your character is controlled as if you were playing a top-down shooter, like Crimsonland for example. But it works and makes for some interesting movement mechanics! I'm also a huge fan of the fact that your damage relies on consistently hitting skillshots and that there's no RNG involved (no crits or other BS like that). Matches are usually about 5-10 minutes long, making it the perfect lenght for me. The game isn't played in a traditional 5vs5 format either, you can play either 2vs2 or 3vs3, making it a lot easier to find enough friends to play with.Battlerite to me is the essence of what makes a MOBA fun. It's easy to learn, hard to master and packed to the brim with action that rewards skill over reliance on items or a particular skill-build. In short, all the good parts of a MOBA compressed into a visually appealing package that is sure to keep me entertained for a long time!"

Instead you fight.This game is kind of in it's own genre along with it's precursor Bloodline Champions. It's a top down view fighting game where near every ability is a skillshot, and man is it fun. Everyone is on an equal level. There are no talent trees or runes. You pick a hero and play a best of 5 in 2v2 or 3v3 against an enemy team. That's not to say there's no customization. Every round you get to choose a ""Battlerite"". Battlerites are bonuses or modifiers to your abilities. Getting focused a lot in an early round? Take some defensive battlerites and counter the enemy. Everyone can see what Battlerites were chosen so it's all clearly communicated.If you're looking at this game and thinking ""Oh, I already have hundrers of dollars in DotA or LoL skins, I don't want to play *another* MOBA"" plese consider my words.

Scoop out all of the early-game detritus of a MOBA and add those sweet, sweet teamfights that you farm and level for but in a more concentrated form. No levelling or farming required here, you start as the best you can possibly be and so do your enemy. Battlerites alter abilities but their general use remains similar. If you lose, it is because your team lacked the skill to win.Hard to throw blame in circumstances like these.Positioning is crucial. Did you use that large jump move to enter combat? Well now it is on cooldown and you're without an escape mechanism if the proverbial hits the fan. Are you being too cautious? Well now you are too far from the fight to effectively deal damage or support your allies.Reflexes are crucial. Do you activate your counter in the hopes an enemy will clumsily attack you? Are you that enemy, and will you clumsily attack or see the counter animation and cancel your movement? Are you the healer watching the scenario unfold, and can you effectively shield/heal as required when the event resolves?Hand-eye coordination is crucial. Can you hit an opponent consistently at various distances and speeds with differing projectiles and aoe vectors?

With that being said I believe the controls in Battlerite are perfect. WASD for movement and QERF and space for your abilities while aiming with your mouse can't be faulted in my opinion.Learning curve |This tiled me early but it's a childish approach ""to hard ♥♥♥♥ this"" when I am always wanting a game that doesn't really help you but punches you in the face and tells you to man up. Each champions skills are well suited and the variety between the champs is good. Learning what each of them do comes with time but once you grasp the basics its awesome.Quick Tip #1 |Play the game for 2 hours! I feel that around this point you will be at a point where you can smash some noobs and really get a handle of the game using the champ that you have focused on first. Try and find a champ you like quickly and keep using him/her. Only downside to doing this is you will be going over the refund timer so you decide.Note for Aussies! - There are Australian servers!Early Access... is it buggy and unfinished?It's not finished but it has a very solid foundation that can be expanded upon as time goes on. I personally haven't experienced any issues bar the odd disconnect 1 in 100 launches however quite a few people have complained about various issues I'd still go for it and hope for the best if u experience un nerving issues refund it.I watched a video of gameplay and it looks ok...Classic response that most people have who haven't tried it out. You really need to get in and play it is the most satisfying game I have played in a very long time. It's skill based, strategic, unforgiving, exciting, stressful, imersive and just the sickest thing when you pull off some awesome plays.

After all, teamfights are what makes a MOBA match memorable, yet they are rare. Moreover, the Players are even discouraged from ""fighting over nothing"", while fighting is just what Battlerite is about.Don't think that the game does not require strategy: there are many layers to manage and master.

It's a great arena brawler that is easy to learn but incredibly hard to master. In my humble opinion this game has much harder pvp than Dota 2 or LoL. There are no target skills, you have to land everything manually, which means pure skill. You have 2 currencies gold with which you buy chests, or get them by lvl up or doing daily quests. The loot system in this game is pretty much the same as overwatch. You get chests and each has three items.  If you get a duplicate, then it gets cashed out in crystals which is second currency. With crystals you can buy anything right now (All skins). That pretty much sums it up.People say game will come out as f2p title in 2017, but if you buy now you get all characters for free even future ones. One more thing to mention is every character is effective even on very high elo, game is very balanced in my opinion no ""useless characters"". Definitely would recommend this game."

But IF you played a lot of those games and you jump into this one, chances are, you will be a God while playing this.No items/laning/farming means more time to focus on what really matters...winning team fights. And believe me, there's a lot of it. Bullet time effects means you can plan your next move carefully while evading/hitting the enemy champ. And Battlerites shake things up, meaning you can play the same champ differently everytime if you chose to.Overall, this game feels like it belongs up there with the MOBA greats.

Yes it takes some time to get used to, but if you've played MOBAs before you should have no problem getting the hang of it. I would also recommend this game to new comers of the genre because it is a simple team fighting ""simulator"" without objectives and the castle to destroy across the map. I feel as if each character has a unique fighting style and the gameplay changes based on who you pick. There are some large matchmaking system problems where you'll get rekt because of someone who has practiced waaaay more than you have, but I believe the matchmaking would fix itself once enough players come along. I like the rank system because you cant lose rank, (unless you leave?) for me that means even more competitiveness and JOLLY COOPERATION.

If i could i would write names of IGN of people who are total flamers but i'm gonna keep my mouth shut cus i don't wanna get those flamers in trouble (even though they will probably get stunlock's attention) but anyways what happends more often here is that people seem to be toxic if you don't do this or do that or play badly because you are trying a new champion out or having a bad time playing him.And that is what stops from battlerite being the best game ever. The community needs to learn how to behave and needs to learn how to shut their mouths when PEOPLE ARE TALKING and giving them advices but instead they say ""huh i don't care about your opinion cus you suck so much huh"" but yeah phrases like that. but yeah this game in general is amazing in general but the community just makes me laugh and cry at the same time.One more thing those people who buy the game right now will get all champions and future imagine this like an smite god pack for some people who know it if you want to support the game.For those who can't get the game will be free around january 2017!So yeah that's basically it the community needs to learn some manners and stop being so offensive over something that's stupid."

However, I would recommend this to you only if you have a friend to play with. Playing 2v2 alone is like asking to get flamed.People will flame you when you miss your spells.People will flame you when you fail to win 1v2.People will flame you when they rush into the enemy team and die.People will ragequit after first death.People will flame you when you tell them what they do wrong.You can still find some nice people tho but that is rare since the player base is small.PROS: -graphics-fun heroes-fast matches-loot chest system with nice cosmetic items-mounts-brawl game mode-daily and weekly quests+achievements with rewardsCONS: -small playerbase but I hope f2p will fix it-overpowered team comps-ranked in high gold+ is a toxic craphole8/10"

If you are willing to learn this game is awesome but there will be times when you hate yourself and this game. So it's not for everyone. But is awesome for compititve players who want fast-paced game where react and good aim makes big difference.So is game worth of 20 euros? Core features are working fine right now. Game have not crashed for me but have crashed few times for my friend. Normally at start of the match. There is reconnect feature which lets you connect back to server if your game crashes. If you dont reconnect at start of the match fast enough match will never start and therefore you loose nothing.Character skills are mainly from Bloodline Champions but is slightly modified but core mechanics are in most of cases same. I liked BLC characters and I like these even more.Combat feels more smooth and so does game in general. BLC best feature wasn't graphics. Battlerite have better graphics but it's nothing amazing in my opinion. I like art direction though. Sounds are better and game includes character greetings to each other and insulting dead opponent(s).So generally I say that after playing this game over 30 hours + beta I really love this game. I love the fact that matches are really fast and dont last long since I don't have whole day to play of games because of personal life. This is competitive game which suits me best.I recommend game to everyone who like BLC because this gives everything what it did but just more smoothly and with better marketing (currently all heroes for 20 euros when it in BLC costed 100 euros or huge amount of grinding).If you think games like Dota 2 matches take too long and want pure skill shot competitive game, this is for you!Game will be free upon release if you don't want to spend 20 euros right now."

There is versatility, but it can get repetitive when you`ve played all of them since there still aren`t many of them.There are a few maps (not only 1) so you don`t get bored with them probably? I do like that aspect, because it doesn`t always throw you in the same environment like alot of other games.Overall, it`s a heavily skill based arena game(which is a BIG + for all players seeking a challenge) and it is looking like it will just be getting better with new content added regularly."

But if you're a fan of competitive action, this is one of the most rewarding experiences you will have.For many of us, this game is a continuation of an old title. As a fan of its predecessor, Bloodline: Champions, I will tell you that they've successfully captured the spirit of the old game and have only improved on its formula. This is the Smash Bros: Melee to the Orginal Super Smash Brothers. Plenty of familiar characters, lots of new scenery and eventually new characters as well.As an Early Access title it plays like a finished game. Even if they never released another update, this would be perfectly playable and just as fun.

So far this game is showing absolutely tons of amazing love and work into it. The visuals on each abilities are beautiful to look at.The movements are very smooth and the gameplay as intense and will always be intense the moment those walls go right down to the fight. The rewards in playing the game vary on weapon skins, mounts, personal skins and icons for your profile. I pretty healthy amount of reward system but do wish they add much more fun things to get later on.I will say a few downsides. The game needs to show more help on showing abilities for each character, like a little video showing on what their abilities do and how it works. When I started out I had no clue what each ability a character did even when reading the description, and lastly a lack of game modes though I'm pretty sure will change much later on since this game is still in early access.The best side about this game? The community so far is more positive then negative. Very few I come across dirtbags telling me to git gud in rude manners even when I was first starting out. some people even gaved me pointers on how to play a certain character, even when they themselves hardly played the character.So in other words, If you want a nice intense game that gives nothing but fights and action?

I'll tell you one thing Stunlock Studios did that was right... and that was leaving FunCom, never looking back at that travesty of a game publisher, and going back to their roots. They're a brilliant team of game developers, they do a damn good job at PvP. They've got years and years under their belts, and I'm so happy they managed to recooperate from the stranglehold Funcom had on them for a while. Not many other game developers are so lucky.Well enough about the studio, now to look at the game.Polished.That's one word I would use to describe the overall feel of the game. It's absolutely, very well made and you can tell that this was made by a very passionate team.This game was being developedfor a much longer than most people know. A lot of people will come to it without knowing the rich history behind Battlerite, and how a game like this could spring up out of nowhere. Without absolutely no bugs this game runs perfectly, it has impressive graphics and physix beating games like LoL and DoTA2 in that department as well.Gameplay:Fast-paced(at times calling it fast-paced is an understatement),addictive,  andexhilarating.There are a lot of factors that come to play when trying to explain why this game is so addictive, but it really just dwindles down to the fact that it's incredibly satisfying, and it's pulse-pounding fun. Meaning you're gonna get into some matches and by the end of it you'll be sweatin', you'll be shakin, but you're still gonna be shootin! and you're still gonna be gettin those KO's, you're adrenaline kicks in and your visual acuity sharpens, you reactions times enhance and you're on fire! and  you feel that fire and once you're outta the match you wanna hop in for another go at it. It's hard to stop at times.Best part being that you don't need to dredge through 20 minutes of building up and dealing with terrible team mates or toxic people arguing for those 20 minutes and then ANOTHER 20 minutes while you either win or lose and leave the game feelin' like you wasted tons of time, unsatisfied. Somehow that appeals to a large amount of people I guess, but this is the game for people who want to be spared the tedium once and for all and place a PVP game that's everything they've always wanted. This is REAL Arena combat.There's a rewarding ""Grade"" system as you progress you grade higher and you faces better players who are also that high. Think of it like a ratings system. It works fine by me, the people at the top are definitely, INCREDIBLY good players, in a league of their own for sure.Speaking of rewards, there are a lot of cosmetic items in this game and those are the only thing that you can buy with money. But the cool thing is that you can also earn them through chests that you earn through completeing quests which are long th lines of ""Win 6 Games"", I think you get the idea. I like this because those people who can't afford it can still customize and feel like they're earning new stuff. I'm sure they'll add exclusive items for those who spend the money but that's fair, they need to support themselves somehow.Community:So far I haven't encountered any toxicity in this game besides Croak and Lucie (ehh ehh, get it?! cuz they use poisons! hahaha...anyway) - It's all been pleasant thus far, helpful players, sharing tips, grouping up after matches and playing together, adding one another to friends, although I'm a generally friendly guy in games like these nowadays so I usually spark up small chat and if they're good players and we're on the same par skill wise I'll add them for future play or playing right then and there.Battlerite also has an automatic recording feature that lets you go to past games you've played, replay them and even edit and publish them for everyone else to see. They let you go pretty dang far back which is really impressive.  I wish every other pvp game out there had a system like this (talkin bout you SMITE!) but they don't. Just another way SLS is steppin it up. I know other games do this but not for all matches and nowhere near as far in the past. I did leave some feedback for them talking about cool features to add to it so maybe they'll do it.Overall:Stunlock Studios has really nailed it when it comes to the Arena PVP formula. They've got it down to a science, they know how to make it satisfying on many different levels, the combat, the mechanics, the physics/graphics, the rewards, the social aspects. They've done it! And they're not done yet! I know for sure we've all got a lot of cool stuff on the way. SLS won't let us down now that they've taken the reins again!Anyway -- It's time for me to crash since It's 1AM and I was tryin to go to bed by 11...but I got stuck on Battlerite... lol this is something I should probly get used to soon."

Community seems pretty decent, only get one or two people that get upset if you don't do too well everyone else pretty much GG's at the end of a match.  It's a game where you pick a hero with set abilities, you have all abilities at the beginning of the match so the entire time it's all about skill shots, timed counters and really careful gameplay.  I like it a lot, it's extremely enjoyable and you are automatically scored with a rating as you play the more you win the higher it goes (When you loose there is a bit of a pad to prevent you from loosing huge score in case you are paired with someone not so good.. I personally suggest premades if you wish to get consistant wins.)  It's 2v2 or 3v3 and you can practice on AI if you wanna try new heros or strategies.  Game really brings out your competitive edge and the balance is amazing(imo) even a well played support character can do incredible damage.  I've literally seen people so good with a character they can 2v1 people by chaining abilities, using situational awareness and the usage of orbs.  My hats off to this game.. it is remarkably meaty for it's price, no pay to win everything you buy is cosmetic and you can unlock EVERYTHING providing you play long enough.

,Recommended,504370,25670216,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,Suttles,"Pick a hero and fight in an arena against other players.  That's the main premise of Battlerite, and while that might not sound that exciting the game's core mechanics and balance is well done.You pick a hero (15 total at the moment), choose 3v3 or 2v2, and jump almost instantly into a game.  At the start of each round you pick a Battlerite (which is a buff for your abilities that lasts in each concurrent round).  You spawn on the left side of the arena and head straight to the middle and fight over middle control. Each game is a bo5, and each round doesn't last too long.  Games are quick so it's easy to fix and understand your mistakes.The mechanics of Battlerite are neat, and play like a fighting game. You have energy and health, and as you get hit you lose some of your max health.  Poking is very important in Battlerite.  In the middle of the arena is an orb which when burst open gives energy and some lost max health back. Energy is used for your ultimate (which cost 100%), and a lesser ability that is pretty strong (which cost 25%).  Each hero also has two EX abilities, similar to a fighting game.   These 2 upgraded abilities cost a varying amount of energy and make a skill stronger. Each hero also has a mount + mount speedbost.  The mount has a small channel time, so you can use it to get around the arena and get straight into the action at the start of each round.Overall, Battlerite feels and plays like a completed game.  The game's future looks bright, and I'd gladly recommend it to anyone who enjoys PVP battles.  Even if you are casual as hell, the game offers a lot of fun and is easy to understand.   With only more content to come, it's a great purchase."

,Recommended,504370,26074840,"Posted: 16 October, 2016",all,"Gorechili, The Most Shameful","Battlerite fills a niche that has been arguably glossed over or poorly executed since a Westwood Classic: Nox.Nox, similar to Battlerite, was a top down, fast paced, practically entirely aimed/skill based action game. The only burdens on a player were a mixture of knowledge, planning, and reflex. No errands to be done to obtain power (Gold, leveling), no lengthy time commitments (Games rarely extend longer than ten minutes), and a variety of ways to play (Multiple characters offering varied playstyles).I'm a filthy 30 something, dusty ancient without the time I once had. Battlerite lets me have the intense combat I crave, where WoW PvP, League, HOTS, and various others have strayed from due to design choice or burden of time investment. The no nonsense ""Jump in and crack skulls"" attitude is perfect for me.Plus, even though I cannot play as much as I would like, I can still tell the difference between skill levels in players fairly clearly. The gulf between a new player and an experienced one with just a single character is fantastic. Whenever I am obliterated in a game I can think ""Hey, I can do that. I wonder how he did that. Was it aiming? Skill use? Positioning? Battlerites?""The cosmetics leave a bit to be desired and don't particularly feel properly... weighted? A recolor costs a ton of the in game currency. Regardless, the Overwatch style of loot accumulation still feels great. The avatars given are a varied, quality bunch.For something that is in early access, I have hope for the game. There are plenty of characters not yet transitioned over from Bloodline Champions and I'm sure some will be completely redesigned alongside brand new characters, which gives me hope for overall diversity and freshness in the game. Plus, the built in tournament system hinted at being intergrated (similar to its presence in BLC) will be a fantastic hand up over other competitive multiplayer games currently in the market.If you want something that is new and doesn't ask you to sit down for 20+ minutes minimum while also giving you a sense of skill growth, give Battlerite a spin."

Battlerite is highly competitve, yet easy to learn if you put time into it. In addition, the vast majority of the community is amazing, aside from the ocassional troll. The only complaint I have is that there could be more champions, but for an early access game, that is highly forgivable (there are currently 19 champions, plenty to choose from).If you enjoy intense pvp action where you'll always be on your toes, Battlerite is the game for you.  10/10"

Lots of games are stressful: playing league or dota is a big time investment towards an experience that might be entirely too long and entirely too frustrating, but this game gives me the same satisfaction of having played better than my opponents without tilting me out the side of a tall building when I lose.

The WASD controls are very tight and imo, what sets this game apart from other top-down titles that rely on point-and-click interfaces. It feels much more involved and visceral this way. The developers are exactly right when they say the skill-based gameplay makes for engaging and challenging matches, it's very well executed.There are some relatively minor issues that I hope get addressed at some point. First is that there is no true fullscreen support. Running multiple monitors, I sometimes find my mouse has accidentally drifted onto my second monitor, preventing my control inputs. Second is that I hope the matchmaking becomes a bit more robust in that, after a match has completed, users can choose to continue into the next match with the same teammates. As it stands right now, users have to add those people to their friendslist, form a party, and then re-search for matches. I suspect this current implementation is a way to avoid having a lobby period prior to the matches, where users can select new heroes, etc, but nonetheless, it would be a welcome addition until (if?) an online lobby period is introduced."

Instead of the traditional three lanes and jungle set up this game has an enclosed arena enviroment.

It's never ending teamfights. It's like skipping to the 40 minute mark of league where everyone is full build and you're actually starting to have fun because you're playing at full power. I also recommend this game because it's very fast paced and matches don't take long at all due to a sudden death mechanic which makes the arena create a shrinking death zone which does high amounts of damage over time.For me this game is a10/10, it's absolutly perfect for me."

,Recommended,504370,25692303,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,Sequitur,"For those that remember the ill-fated Bloodline Champions, Battlerite should already be a familiar name.From the same creators as BLC, Battlerite is a skill based (player skill, that is) arena combat game. The emphasis here is on skill shots, awareness and decision making. Presently there are 15 characters available, including ranged, support and melee classes. Each feels completely unique and comes with his own perks and weaknesses. The true beauty in this game is that no single composition feels broken, and each character is viable if played correctly.Battlerite, like BLC before it, caps maximum character health after damage has been done to them, so fights don't get drawn out endlessly - and it works marvelously. The result is powerul but not overpowered healers, that have to embrace a hybrid role by also dealing damage and crowd controlling.Before each round in a match, players get a choice of one of three battlerites - skill modifiers for character abilities. This can change the dynamic of the match significantly, as several choices alter the way a character should be played. A consequence, of course, is that no match plays exactly the same.Presently leveling up characters and completing daily quests earns you chests, which contain vanity items, such as new weapon skins, outfits and avatar portraits. I suspect this will be the main source of monetization once Battlerite goes free to play. If they follow a similar model as BLC, all characters will be able to be unlocked with in game currency.What is ultimately left is an addictive, just-one-more-match competitive PvP game that is, in its present form, already well worth the price of admission. Very highly recommended!"

(OKAY, a HUGE anger problem with them..) BUT, Battlerite's gameplay is so much fun I don't even feel mad when I lose. Only when I make mistakes is when I get a little upset but hey it's part of the gameplay.Pretty much imagine team fighting without all the buildup, imagine a GvG situation in an MMO, the feeling of seeing your opponents and the suspence of who will make the first move.. ALL OF THAT wrapped up in a small arena.The only cons I can think of are obvious ones:-Learning Curve: There is one. How steep it is depends on your playstyle. If you only play one champion, you'll have to learn what others do through battle and that can be a bit rough, the higher your rank gets. If you play all the champions(which you should because there are daily quests which give rewards for playing certain ones), you'll learn every champions moveset through experience and knowing is half the battle.. LITERALLY. Knowing what every champion can do is THE MOST IMPORTANT skill in Battlerite to learn. One I current am very ignorant of. But it's not a huge learning curve, there's even AI matches and training arenas to help if you just want to test champions out, so.. yeah!-Matchmaking: It's not perfect. No games Matchmaking can be perfect. However, in the future I imagine this will be ironed out. This is Early Access anyway. When it goes F2P I imagine this will help with a surge of new players to have more close games. But I feel the game's matchmaking is pretty decent.TL;DR: Team Fights. 2v2/3v3. Fun.PLAY THIS GAME NOW.

The maps are small, however they allow you to out-maneuver opponents with the fog of war (which in my opinion is done very well). This lets the game not feel overbearing if you're ever in a melee vs. ranged situation.The battlerite system is super satisfying. It gives you a good sense of growth and intensity when you get access to better rites later into the game. The best of 5 format is the best format that I would imagine for the game. Getting a reverse sweep is beautiful.Rather than talking about cons, I would like to remind you that while I definitely advise people to purchase this game if they're a fan of the teamfighting aspect of MOBA's, that it is in early access, so bugs and minor balance issues are to be expected. I'll likely come back to discuss the cons and what can be improved with more playtime.I really like this game and would like to see it grow, so give it a shot if you love all-out brawls.*There needs to be more options for customising your game experience.*The in-game ability descriptions should tell you whether an ability is a line skillshot or an area ability, just because it makes it easier to understand.I* would personally like a clear distinction between what can and cannot go over walls in the game.*The center orb could use a visual indicator when its about to explode (or if there is already one, make it more obvious. I haven't seen it.)*The ability to browse through the client while in queue would be nice. You can't really do anything but look at your own characters abilities. Being able to look at other champs and open chests would be great.*Area-cast abilities could use a max cast range indicator.*Further steam integration (inviting, adding) would be nice*Spectating friends could be cool.

Currently it is still in early access but if you get the current bundle you unlock every character released in a similar vein to smite so well worth it while its there. However this means there are some downsides from being early slightly long queue times and a bit of lag. Also they made the fat guy from bloodlines not fat so i guess its literally unplayable.

The main reason for that is the game mechanics. The way the game works is quite unique and if you are into competitive pvp I coulnd't reccomend it more. You move around with ASDW and orient the camera with your mouse, meaning you have to aim not only every skillshots but melee and ranged attacks as well. Definitely something hard to master but at the same time intuitive and fun to watch.The only downside I can think of is character design. It's just an alpha but I'm pretty sure most of the champions aesthetic is not gonna be reworked any time soon (sadly), and imho there is not even one champ pleasing to the eye. The concept art in most cases is good, the idea and background are fine too, but it is just poorly realized.Still, matches are really worth playing, the developers' mission statement is worth reading, and overall the game is worth writing a positive review."

,Recommended,504370,29553915,Posted: 28 January,all,Kuuhaku,"Battlerite is often described as a MOBA without the creeps/jungle/towers/items, and that's relatively accurate. But I think the better description would be a top-down version of World of Warcraft arena. It certainly reminds me more of the latter than the former, mostly because of the pacing (Battlerite matches aren't quite as quick as the typical MOBA teamfight), but also because each character has more abilities than your typical MOBA character.This game is all about positioning, teamwork, skillshot aim, and timing. It's extremely satisfying, and there's a ton of opportunity to outplay your opponents. When it's working right, there's almost zero danger of the typical MOBA ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t occurring. What I'm referring to are things like being perma-CC'd, or taken from 100%-0% health inside of a single stun, or having battles that go on forever because the healers are just able to keep everyone topped off. The game's systems work in such a way as to discourage or outright prevent all of that, and that's really refreshing.Definitely worth the purchase if you're sick of any of the stuff I just described, or you're bored of WoW arenas."

It has different characters, the similarity pretty much stops there.What Battlerite is, is a 2v2/3v3 fast paced arena brawler. The games takes about 10 minutes or less to finish, and the match mostly consists of map control and fighting to the death. If you die, your out. No respawning. Every move, ability and damage point matters. First to three wins, walks out of the game as champions.You move with WASD, and you have 7+2 abilities. And they are all skill shots. Yes, you can NOT click on an enemy and attack, you gotta aim every single attack and ability, all while positioning your self properly.Safe to say, it was a bit confusing at first. But once I got the hang of it, it was so fun and rewarding to land shots, space out abilities to kite perfectly and positioning my self so I don't just die every time.But even still, I feel like I'm only scratching the surface of mastering this game.Yes, I recommend this title. But with the consideration that it is in fact Early Access, it has some big flaws like balancing, poor matchmaking and questionable hitboxes. But with some more work, and a bigger player base, I can definitely see this become one of the big competitive ""easy to learn, but hard to master"" games out there.And with that said, I'm gonna play some more right now!"

Realy love the new design of characters, which now can be distinguished each form another, yet still are quite in one style, which is a rare sight in games.The game is balanced. To some it would seem that some characters are IMBA - don't forget, that they are so only when ods are in their favor. Every character has strong sides and quite serious flaws. Maps also are super-well made, though I'm not sure, why almost all games I played from the left side. (Only like 3 times from right).One thing to notice - people with bigger screen resolution can see farther. There are small red triangles on your character, showing the direction of the enemy he can see. But it's not enough to gues their positioning, IMO.Optimized really well, can play on toster laptop (Please, add option to turn off volumetric clouds. It was big issue in BC, and still persists in Battlerite. It doesn't cook PC in battles, but when on platforms - it's seriously laggy.)Can't wait for drunken master and archer. (From BC)Though, there's a big issue I don't like. In BC character outfits changed look quite noticeably, preserving overall style. In Battlerite, it's only reskinned, which is boring and absolutely not worth challenge for. I paid in BC for skins, cuz they were interesting to change to. Here - I don't want to pay for a recolor. I know, it's optimization issue, but still - please, consider to change outfit options. (Can't even imagine happiness, if some styling would be tied up to steam workshop... ah, those sweet dreams.)"

I am in love with this game! It's such a good way to waste time and i mean that in a good way. I'll do my best to list the pro's and con's:Pros:-The art style seems really fresh and vibrant.-Short rounds allow you to squeeze in a game real quick, especially if you're good and roll another team ;)-Although some characters may remind you of other games, they are not the same. They are all unique and very fun!-Multiple maps gives you different ways to play each game.-No ""pay to win,"" just crates for skins (literally just like overwatch.)-Can be played casually or competitively.-Each round is a level playing field. No levels, items, getting fed, etc.-The community, for the most part, is very great and i suggest you visit the subreddit!Cons:-Small character pool (of course it's early and that will be fixed.)-Personally not a fan of shift abilities.-The skins are just recolors. Not exactly unique but again, it's early access.Basically any con can be attributed to early access and most complaints are things that will be fixed. With this game, you get the shortness of a quick game like Hearthstone, the look of a MOBA, but the WASD movement gives it a completely different feel as well as the closed in arena. It's a perfect blend in my personal opinion and i cannot wait to see where this game goes. It is most definitely worth the money and i bought the ultimate fan pack just to support the Devs for doing such a great job for such an unfinished game."

So it really rewards players with a high skill level. From what I've played so far, there's no champion that's completely OP and how strong some champions are can really differ from player to player based on their level of skill.If you like a hero brawler that's about instant action and feels pretty much balanced, this is the game for you. Note that it'll go free-to-play someday, so you don't necessarily have to buy it."

Of course, I would say that, given Bloodline Champions was my favorite game, ever. If you want a fast-paced multiplayer battling game, Battlerite is for you. Tired of forty-minute-long matches that are decided at the twenty minute mark? Tired of last-hitting minions for ten minutes? Tired of squabbling over farm and kills with your teammates? Well, Battlerite's for you. This game is played in short rounds. (1-2 minutes.) You will play best of five rounds. So even a whole match is much shorter than a game of your favorite MOBA. Also, the two game formats are 2v2 and 3v3, so it's easy to put together a team. Because the game is divided into rounds, if your team makes horrible mistakes, instead of sitting there for twenty minutes suffering, you can just figure out what you did wrong, then go and win the next round. Also, instead of an overall slow pace but with moments that are almost too fast to follow, Battlerite has a relenetlessly quick pace.Really, though, the reason to like Bloodline Champions is how the core gameplay works. You move with WASD and aim all your abilities. Because of this, there are a lot of mind games. You have to guess where your opponent will be a fraction of a second from now. Also, there are lots of counter moves, intensifying the need to predict your opponents. In this game, you can't just get in range and land guaranteed damage. It's much more fighting game-like than those games where you right click your opponent. If you want a game that's really action-y, this game is for you. If you just want to battle, this game is for you. If you want a game full of depth and subtlety and room to grow as a player, this game is for you."

I looked at the reviews and decided to buy it and have been very glad of the decision I have made. At first the button layout seems odd if you come from playing other mobas but its easy to transition to, and gets more comfortable to move with WASD traditionally then clicking with a mouse. Its very focused on skill and decision of going in or not and you wont win just by having a ""better"" champion than the other players. If you play someone really well youre guaranteed to have sucess with them. Ive played about 20 hours of solo queue and to be honest its not that bad. I havent experienced extreme toxic behavior, no flamers other than the casual ""What were you thinking xD?"". Theres a very nice balance between champions and you will definetely be able to find the champion that fits your play style. All in all its a incredibly fun $20 pick up that I will never regret getting, and the game devs just want to see their community grow and expand as time goes on. More champions will be added (I assume) and that will just add more depth to the excellent playing field that is Battlerite."

Not many games manage to achieve that especialy seeing as this game is in early access.

Already in early acces it's a balanced and competitive experience.The gameplay is fast and rewarding, there is no RNG wich means that if you are better than your opponent you can and  will kick their♥♥♥♥♥ The 2v2 format is perfect for a ""solo que"" system as it makes teamplay possible whilst minimizing the chanses for afks or trolls. It also gives your actions much more meaning and bigger consequences. If you play bad in Battlerite you are going to lose because you're half your team whilst in a game like LoL or DOTA 2 where there are 5 players in each team you can still get carried if you play bad and you can still lose even if you play good.The characters are designed in a way that allowes for outplays to happen. There are no fixed abillities (other than shields) and everything can be dodged. Majority of caracters also have ways of becoming ""imaterial"" or ignoring all effects for a small period of time.There are many ""trances"" or counters that make your caracter enter a state where if you get hit by a projectile or melee strike you get a benefite. This allows for great moments and mindgames as you try to trick your opponent into using their trance and get them to trigger yours. All this and more makes winning feel rewarding as you can clearly tell how you played better than your opponent.I have personally felt in love with this game after spending the last 6 years playing League of Legends. This game has been really refreshing for me because of how little time you spend waiting for things. Playing a game of league takes so long and is filled with so much nothing. In battlerite farming is replaced with fighting, walking form lane to lane is replaced with trying to get the last hit of the middle orb befor the enemy, watching your allies carry you for 20 minutes after a lost laningphase never happens because there is no laningphase or snowballing as that would ruin the competitivness, instead of getting smashed to pieces by a vayne your bot lane fed you are picking the right battlerite for the next round after you lost the last because of a stupid misstake your never going to do again. All there is is fighting. Positioning, outsmarting, maximising damage and settign up cc combos with your friend is all you do. And it never gets old.The negatives for me have been the lack of progression. You have a level on each caracter that you can level up to ten but the rewards haven't been to intriguing. There is no way of showing of these levels either and the time it takes to get a caracter to level ten isn't to long. A simple fix would be to take away the cap of the levels and let you brag about it in some way. Otherwise there is really nothign but the ranking system to progress through. As far as I know there have been no talk about a progression system either unfortunatly.What keeps me playing is the rewarding feeling of playing better than the other guy.Over all I hope you give this game a try when it is released and becomes free to play in early 2017."

Game runs smoothly, and haven't had any crashes or problems playing. You start right into the fighting when you start a game. Games don't last extremely long either so it's easy to play games here and there. Has a high learning curve which takes time, but worth learning. Playing any character well allows you to not have any hard counters. Every character has an escape and a counter/invisible with some ranged skill. There are supports, tanks, dps to pick from so you can always be playing someone different.Only cons I have is that matchmaking is complete garbage, no reason for two rank 11s to be facing a rank 12 and 13 in solo queue. Also a majority of the community rages all day, but that is expected in every game ever. No casual play, every game you play is matchmaking and affects elo.For being in ea it's a great game. Sure there aren't that many characters, but in time they will be released and already have 2 planned.

Most of the reviews on steam already talk about what a fantastic game Battlerite is, and this will be no different. While the game has things that need to be tweaked here and there, my overall experience with the game has been absurdly positive.It's early access done right. The devs give us very frequent content updates along with even more frequent balance updates. They've listened to the community throughout the entire period of early access and I think given time, Battlerite could indeed become a huge game. If you're a fan of arena combat, this game is a must have and even if you're on the fence about getting it, ask a few friends about it!I've recommend the game to 4 people after having it recommended to myself, and I'm absolutely in love with it, along with the 4 people whom I've pulled into my addiction. 9.5/10. 10/10 with rice."

Some of them will fit better in a 3v3 situation when others will fit better in a 2v2 situation, but in the end it only comes to you knowing what are your weaknesses and what are your strenghts, and eventually playing around them.In addition to that, there is no advantage in winning a round, it actually only means being closer from the win. You will always be able to come back from a 0-2 if you find out what were your mistakes, or how to counter the ennemies' strategy. Also, the game has been designed so that you will still stand a chance of winning the round while being the last man alive in your team. Dead allies will drop their energy that will be available to pick up for the other members of the team, allowing you to throw two ultimates in less than 10 seconds.Quick games, small teams, Battlerite is the perfect game to play with some friends to enhance the teamwork and win more often =)"

The overall experience is clean as ♥♥♥♥ . NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG. All skill and CD based combat. All the champions feel unique and alive. The core gameplay doesn't have any glaring issues that are noteworthy. The only gameplay issue to date is that the skill shot notifications aren't the most erucate. Hard to read sometimes if you are going to get hit. But given these Devs this will be fixed eventually.The champion pool is under three categories. All the champions are rather unique but some of the ideas carry over to other champions such as counters. The first being ranged. Ranged champions as you would think are just champions that their main auto attack is a range ability. They have different mechanics such as a bow that shoots slower but hits harder and a shotgun that does spread damage and damage per bullet.  I would recommend playing Jade to understand the mechanics down for most ranged champions (again personal opinion). The second category is melee. This is as you would think their auto attacks are within melee range. This does not mean they have no ranged abilities. Also their ranged weapons have different ranges based on the champion.The last category is Support. This is mostly based on the fact they have a heal built into their main abilities.I will not go huge into mechanics of this game because this is a review and I just wanted to give you a snapshot.CONTENTThe game currently only has 14 champions last time I counted. They are adding new ones at the moment at least 1 or 2 every month which is pretty damn good for this type of arena game.There are loot boxes similar to other games. They each drop 3 items. The first type is the silver chest which you can only acquire by playing the game(quests, playing a champion repeatedly, etc). This chest is pretty easy to come by and will give you a base start but can drop some sweet stuff. The second chest is the gold chest which costs in game currency of 500 gold which can take a few hours to get. These chests can also be purchased with real money in bulk amounts.  The last chest is the Legendary chest which is only able to get by leveling up a champions(you get levels by playing them). There are certain events that might throw one in there as a bundle like they did for the last champ that came out.FINAL SCORE9.5 / 10Overall one of the best games I have played hands down. Great to pick up at any point and just play a couple of games then head out for the day. Devs are clear on their intentions which doesnt happen often. Buy this game and don't look back. I am by no means a pro at this game but hit me up if you want to play sometime!Thanks for reading!"

You get a TOTALLY skill based dynamic top-down arena with a very interesting and fast gameplay. It literally take about 6-8 minutes to finish  a match. The heroes are very different and versatile due to the battlerites, no hero is similar to another. If u picked a carry and your team has no support or tank you can build that hero serve this roles using battlerites, isn't that awesome? I don't know if this a pro or con but you do a blind choice when selecting a hero. Beside these imense good qualities there are still some problems: 1) Weak customization - you can only change weapons, clothes and victory poses. I really wish to change the haircut or boots for some heroes. 2) Still some troubles with servers - sometimes you are just stuck at the loading and proposed to reconect or leave, the reconect doesn't always get you back to the game and you are forced to leave glad you are not losing MMR for this. 3) Maybe this is not a problem but silence works weird there, if you are silenced you can't do your regular M1 attacks it's not an issue but it's just not logic.CONCLUSION: This is definitelly the best way to spent your 7$."

But I can assure anyone doubting, that if you played any moba, and want some shorter action with fast paced combat, this is the one for you.Also here is a ravioli recipe.Ravioli Dough:-2 cups all-purpose flour-1 pinch salt-1 teaspoon olive oil-2 eggs-1 1/2 tablespoons waterRavioli Filling:-1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese-1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened-1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese-1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded-1 egg-1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsleyPesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce:-2 tablespoons olive oil-2 cloves garlic, crushed-3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce-2 cups heavy cream-1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese-1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauceEgg Wash:-1 egg-1 tablespoon waterDirectionsPrep: 45 mCook: 15 mReady In: 2 hMound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce."

Battlerite is essentially an updated version of the same, but beautifully focused on quick 2v2 and 3v3 matches, AND has the added benefit of not being managed by Funcom.From what I understand the game will be F2P upon release, but honestly WELL worth the asking price even now in early access. I haven't had this much fun with a new game in so long. Some of the social features and the UI could use some work, but haven't taken away from my experience thus far.Pros-Customization (Both Cosmetics and from in-game Battlerites that effect combat)-Quick and Exciting Matches-Replay System with functionality to edit and share-PvP and PvE (Including Private matches where you invite your friendsCons-Early Access (There are a few bugs here and there, but none have been game-breaking)-Audio Issues (Possibly just an early access problem, but once in a while everything will get really distorted)-Skin Customization is a little thin at the moment-UI needs improvementI HIGHLY recommend this game as I have been depriving myself of sleep for days on end now just to play it.Please don't ruin your life like I have."

It's not easy, and at the moment there isn't much to do besides wrecking your opponents. But do we really need all that fluff? Sure, there are skins to earn to customize your favorites champs and there is  a leveling system that rewards you with currency, chests, and Avatars, but other than that there isn't a whole lot.Turns out you don't need a whole lot when the gameplay is smooth and polished, the graphics and sound are good, and the core gameplay makes you want to play that ""One final round"" before heading off to bed.It's not perfect, but it's early access so that is kind of expected. That doesn't mean it's ridled with problems. It's actually quite the opposite. Everything just feels so good that the minor bugs and lack of skins (don't worry, they are adding more!) don't really matter when the gameplay feels as good as it does.I've been looking for a game that fill this niche since BLC. I'm just glad that the creators of BLC were the ones to do it. I don't need to grind lanes for 45 minutes with 5 second team fights speckled in. I don't need hundreds of items to memorize.

No no no, it's more than that. It's some of the fastest most entertaining combat I've ever encountered (Besides Bloodline Champions of course which is the game this is based off of) The skill ceiling of this game is ridiculously high to the point where no two matches feel the same. The cast of characters is somewhat small as of now, yes but the devs are working to add more and it's exciting. To all of my friends or anyone who is thinking about buying into the early access, I'd say go for it. It was more than worth my money(Especially seeing as how the value of the early access pack is really high since you get all characters current and future.)Edit: I normally don't write huge reviews but for this game I kind of have to so here we go.This game is fantastic there's nothing else to really say that does it glory. The idea of the game is magnificent in the fact that it shows potential to be a great esport after some balance patches and etc. There's a reason the game wasn't released to the public as of yet. The game does need some polish. There's some strange bugs a not that great ranking system, no normal games and a whole slew of things that would turn so many people off right away. But don't let that stop you. The devs are constantly working and constantly listening to the complaints of the community to make a great game for everyone. The content seems boring at first sight (According to some people I've tried to show it to.) But it's quite interesting since the game never feels like the same game. After one round is completed you have a set of options that allow you to play the game with as much freedom as you want. The whole idea is to give players options that are all good and all useful. Plus the skill ceiling makes it all the better. You can play the game and constantly improve. Grasping the basics WILL be a little tough. You WILL hit into every counter. You WILL miss a lot. There's no saying you'll pick up this game and be a god at it instantly. But there's so much more to the game. Push through the frustration of sucking and a whole world is opened to you.

That's it. That's all there is.You start the client, pick a champ, hop into an arena, beat 2 or 3 peasants a few times and let the cycle begin anew.They have announced that it will become Free 2 Play with micro-transactions for cosmetic upgrades because, and I'm probably quoting the sales executive on the board meeting in which this decision took place, ""it worked for League of Legends"". The cosmetics are also unlockable through an ingame currency which you earn by playing.The game also tries really hard to be an E-sport, so we should judge it as one.First of all, there is a suprising mechanical depth behind the brawling, which makes watching a match as a player really engaging as well. The battles are tightly action-packed with enough overview to have an idea of what's going on. On top of that, the titular perks, that upgrade one of your abilities, chosen as a new round starts make for an interesting strategic draft.The immediate downside is that this very depth also makes the game hard to explain to anyone who hasn't played it before without crashing their brainserver with ridiculous amounts of onunderstandable gibberish. It's the computergame equivalent of talking soccer with your wife.That being said, I really like playing the game. The mechanics and maps are balanced enough to always have a way to outplay your opponents and I've always liked skirmishing over macro-wavecontrol anyway.

Go back and watch your replays to improve and address mistakes, or make a clip of that sick play and post it in-game for others to watch!- Ability to disable chat if that one idiot won't stfu about how bad you are.Cons:- Matchmaking system can be questionable at times, grinding for MMR can be frustrating. Hopefully they address this soon.- UI needs some work.- Friends list needs some work.- No ability to change in-game name.- No unranked mode as of now for practicing other champions, and bot matches are ridiculously easy.Being that the game is in EA, there are some kinks that need addressed, but at $20, I still think it's worth a buy. Plus, if you buy before it goes F2P and is officially released, you get Founder status and get all champions free forever."

,Recommended,504370,25810882,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,GROSSLY INCANDESCENT,"This game is amazing. Now I may be biased because I love moba style combat, but in truth this game isn't even a moba. Or maybe it's just a moba in its purest form? Battlerite cuts EVERY single ounce of fat from the genre. If you love fast, skill based pvp in an arena/fantasy setting this is just as good as it gets. Every game is different from the last, every death can be learned from, every hero intricate and fun. As of now the community is extremely positive from my experience, I think its mostly due to the fact that a single game is so short (5-8mins) getting upset or raging over it is pointless. Now this is an early access title which should (rightly so) bring some worry. But considering the developers wonderful support of their last title, in which this is a spiritual successor, I'm not concerned in the least. The game being in such a good state of balance and variance this early in development speaks volumes to their experience and love for it. I think Battlerite has nowhere to go but up, and I'm so happy I stumbled upon it.If you're even slightly interested in this, buy it. You won't be disappointed."

76561198073904210,Recommended,504370,26289090,"Posted: 29 October, 2016",all,Naalith,"I've never been so quick to jump to recommending a game. I've played nearly every MOBA on the market, have over 8000 games on LoL and still play it every day, play Smite, play HotS, played Awesomenauts, played DotA. On top of that I am super into team based games like Overwatch and Paladins. Maybe it's my experience from so many other games in the genre but I've never been so pleasantly surprised by a game right from the beginning. Firstly, this isn't like any other MOBA. Some might argue that it isn't even a MOBA. Items, minion farming, draft pick, and currency systems have all been stripped from the game. Don't let that scare you off like it did me for a few weeks, because this game has refined short, punchy combat to perfection.Firstly, the map is extremely small and the center has healing orbs and things that charge your ult (ults charge similarly to Overwatch and Paladins, hitting enemies and healing allies charges it faster, or use the orbs in the middle of the map.) This means that if a team gets pushed from the center, they are at a disadvantage and can fall behind, leading to a sense of urgency to fight in the center of the map.Secondly, the games are short. While many people, myself included, may find other MOBAs to be a more epic and full experience with tons of intricacies, the low end for a time investment in those games is 20 minutes. In League and DotA, games can stretch upwards of an hour and even go over at times. This game is perfect for if you want to jump out and into games super quickly. Victory is achieved by one team winning 3 rounds by eliminating all other players. Each round after 2 minutes, the sides of the Arena become dark and begin to close in. Soon only the center of the map remains, and people outside the center of the map will take massage damage per second until they die. This means each round will only go, at most, two and a half minutes. However, this doesn't cheapen the experience at all. The rounds are adrenaline filled and super punchy and surreal. A single person can outplay the other team with an ult and crazy wins and comebacks can happen like when the opposing team has two rounds won, and you need to win all three to win the whole match.Thirdly, the combat is just fantastic. Each character feels full of intricacy and is difficult to master to the full extent of their power, like any good competetive game. Each character has a defensive ability, ultimate, and what I called charged abilities. Charged abilities use a quarter of your ult's charge to do a more powerful attack on a standard ability, or you can use a quarter ult charge to use an extra spell that isn't normally available. This means you have to carefully manage your energy. Are you the last man on your team alive in a 1v2? Are you sure in that situation you can charge your full ult? Are you sure your full ult will even be more beneficial to you winning than four charged abilities with extra effects? At the start of each round, each character also gets to choose a Battlerite, which enchants an aspect of your character. For example, a character I play has an extremely high slow for 1.5 seconds, but on round one I like to take a Battlerite that turns the slow into a root. This means instead of people weaseling their way out by walking or using a movement ability, they are stuck in place and my team can better jump on them and kill them. With up to 5 rounds in each game and 3 Battlerites chosen per round, you can adapt your character to what you need in each game depending on who you are up against. These decisions have to be made quickly, on the fly, and a mess up could cost you your like.Finally, speaking of a mess up costing you your life, that is perhaps the greatest strength of this game. Winning is based entirely upon your skill as a player and your skill as a team. With no items, no leveling, and no hidden runes or masteries outside the game like in many other MOBAs, the game is completely balanced unless you choose the wrong Battlerite for the situation (still your fault) or make a mistake in the course of a fight. Death is permanent each round, die and you are out until the next round comes around. Dive too hard and you might get stunned and killed instantly. Stay back too long while your team goes in and they might die 2v3 without you. Miss an ult or use a charged attack at the wrong time, making you unable to use your ult, you know the drill. One of the first games a friend and I played in a 2v2 matchup we were playing against people who had chosen the same characters at us, and we ended up going to round 5 with two wins on each team. The last round was extremely intense, but we coordinated our attacks on our opponents and barely beat them with one of us dead and the other about two hits from dying. It may literally have been one of the biggest adrenaline rush I've ever felt in a game, and that's saying a lot after having played so many other competetive games. Individual skill matters here, the only objective is to kill the other team and there won't be ""fed"" enemies coming and killing you with a three item lead like in other games. It sounds simplistic, but the combat is so intricate that it never feels that way in the heat of the short rounds. Leveling characteres and completing quests give you access to purely cosmetic items, similar to Overwatch, and every character is unlocked from the start so there is no pay to win.Overall, the game is just great, and if you love competitive games like me you will be hard pressed to find a better $20 purchase to feed your addiction. If you are one to avoid early access I can understand that, but just know this isn't your Rust or DayZ that need patches to feel fun after years of being on the market, this game is already worth it in its current state. The game feels complete and I'm sure they'll continue to add new skins, characters, and maps up to and after launch. Get some friends to buy it with you and the experience is even better, but even solo the game is fantastic. If you are still on the fence, this game has quite the following on Twitch and you can check out the gameplay for yourself. For short, adrenaline filled competitive matches it doesn't get much better than this.Update, I've played about 30 hours since this review, and it is still awesome."

Though there are some items that will show up differently. I'd rather have it DOTA-like (Where you get parts, not the whole set), but that's just my preferrence.Sound- Meh. Too generic. I don't mind though.Visuals- Closest to DOTA imo. Looks great actually.Community- No idea. I like the option to disable chat so that I can't see them bashing me. Though based on other feedback, community's great.PERFECT for guys like me who doesnt have time for a 30-60 minute match.Will be buying the other DLC. I suggest you buy this now instead of waitng for it to be F2P. You know, the herculian task of unlocking each heroes. If you wanna support the Devs then purchase the DLC. With Goblin slaves to carry you as your mount included.Suggestions:I don't like being queued when I already picked my character. Since you play as a group, I think it's important to have synergy (at least with the characters you pick) with your teammates. I think the queue would be faster as well. Or have an option for selecting a character first or queueing first.I also find the chest rewards lacking. Though I'm sure that It'll be better in the future. Honestly, I don't care about the icons.

You can't fall behind because you're terrible at farming and you can't feel like someone has an OP champion because every champion is already unlocked for you! The rounds are best of 5s which a max limit of 2 minutes per a round so your games will only be 10 minutes maximum. The combat mechanics are quite interesting as there is no real burst aside from ults and even those wont obliterate you so you dont have to worry about getting insta-killed as there is always going to be enough headroom to react to a situation. Overall I would highly recommend this game and I would write more to this review if I wasnt so darn lazy."

,Recommended,504370,31328465,Posted: 23 April,all,AsCii_exe,"Normally I don't like MOBAs that don't have long matches like LoL or DOTA because when the match ends I always feel like it was too short or that it ends just when the fun part begins but I never got that feeling with this game because every match is more like playing intense mid-game teamfights but your allies and enemies get switched every 15 minutes and  there's really no thing like ""early"" and ""late"" game, even though you still have a match progress, at the start of each round you choose a ""Battlerite"" that's basically a perk that upgrades something for some of your skills like ""now this also silences on hit"" or ""this will heal more"" but also very oftenly things that add an entire new layer of depth to a skill.When I had a few hours in I started to soloQ ranked only and the community is fantastic, well... silver and low gold are swarmed with flamers, specially low gold-high silver (bronzes were pretty chill though), I really recommend you to disable the chat until you reach plat which is actually really easy because until you dont reach high-gold a win gives you 3 times more points than what a lose takes away and when you reach gold 2/higher everyone is really really nice, I never saw a flamer in any game ever since I got into plat, at max someone a bit salty about me failing sometimes but never more than thatAll champs are in general fun to play with and balanced, as in any other MOBA there are a few ones that are very annoying to go against like Pearl and Croak but Pearl is known as the strongest healer in the entire game and Croak is you traditional mobile assassin but I dont think neither of them is broken. One general thing that I would say about the champion pool is that 90% of them are insanely mobile no matter their role every single one of them with 1 to 4 movement skills like dashes, jumps, movespeed buffs, etc and I can cound with one hand the number of champs with only one movement skill, ironically enough I think almost all of them are the weakest champs atm.The only con I could see is the fact that it's an early access so there's not a lot of champions and the game can get kind of repetitive if you don't enjoy being a One Trick Pony, not my case though and the fact that the game has 14 perks per champ + 8 skills make all of them quite deep and mechanically intensive so you'll always have something to improve or a new build to try with your mainIn general I would recommend buying it, specially if you have some friend to duoQ with but if you are not really into MOBAs or don't have so much that one trick pony spirit I would wait for it to get out of early access or for some good sale to come up."

,Recommended,504370,27042658,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,Skiru,"Definitely worth buying, it's a fantastic game that feels extremely smooth and well crafted. I have never experienced a bug even though the game is in Early Access. Though I believe the game needs a bit more social media attention to reach a higher player base where it is currently lacking. Other than that, I find the game to be extremely fun and skill-based. Hopefully it can turn into something big after Early Access launch like others of its genre.I have a few suggestions for mere quality-of-life in the world of Battlerite that will improve the game as a whole and bring new faces as well as funds to Stunlock Studios. Now let's dig right into it.Steam Trading Cards:Adding Steam trading cards would be an excellent way to get the name ""Battlerite"" out there to others, also bringing new faces into our community. Steam trading cards have been booming ever since the implementation and has proved success for many titles toward the fact that player's will buy and trade the cards to others, giving the company a percentage of the price.Steam Achievements:Steam achievements would also get the name ""Battlerite"" out there to others, and give players the opportunity to work towards something that would be displayed on their profile for bragging rights and more. (We all know an achievement hunter)In-Game Friend Requests:Currently you either need to remember your teammates name, or write it down simply to add them. You should be able to add them at the end of the match in the score board with ease like most games.Steam Profile Viewing:You should be able to view a player's Steam profile by right-clicking it and directing you to the user's profile for Steam friend-request purposes.Global Chat:The ability to communicate with fellow Battlerite players would be extremely helpful for newer players to simply ask whatever questions they may have in chat for others to answer. A report system specifically for global chat would also be helpful if this becomes an addition to the game, as with any game community, their will be negative players. [Submission by: OTA]Favorited Champions:The ability to right-click a champion and mark it as a favorite is merely a QoL suggestion, though many MOBA and MOBA-like games have done it. It seems to be a way to quickly choose your most-played champions in a hurry, though I'd like it simply to have all of my favorite champions next to eachother.League Abandonment Penalty:I've had many teammates that had disconnected or straight up left the match, even when in the lead. Quitters need some sort of penalization for leaving League matches to deter away from these type of things.More Advanced Tutorial:In the current tutorial, I didn't see anything about cast-cancelling (Pressing ""C"" while casting), which is an extremely important mechanic that new players should be aware of.Everything I haven't covered is either already known, or Stunlock Studios has announced is being worked on. Though if you have any suggestions please let me know and I will add to this list with your name next to your suggestion, thanks!"

As it says in its description, ""a team arena brawler"".Each hero has lots of abilities, and even though there are classes, every hero has escape, disable, defense and offense abilities without exception.There are no lanes or creeps, no towers or buildings, no core, you win by killing enemy players.Like a fighting game, there is a energy meter which you can use to augment your abilities and cast ultimate. There are also pickups on the map like healing orbs, energy orbs and a shared power up in the middle of the arena.There are multiple arenas but they feel very similar. Right now there is standart mode and a weekly or monthly brawl mode, that's all.Almost every ability is a skillshot, so this game is definitley a skill based brawler. Like I said, it feels like a fighting game.There are also cosmetics and chests, similar to Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm model where you don't need a key to open the chests.The controls are very responsive, the netcode is really good and hero/ability designs are unique and fun. Game is desing around the fact that it is a fast paced brawler.Graphics and overall visuals are top quality.

While the community isn't usually all that toxic, being able to communicate with someone and coordinate team setups and plays is much more satisfying than going solo and risking some not so ideal nonsense occuring.This game can be leagues more fun if you're playing with someone you can communicate with. Solo, it's a gamble, but you'll likely still get some fun out of it either way just because of how well-executed the core team-based gameplay is.The gameplay is basically WoW arenas with MOBA-like champions. However, basically all abilities are skill shots to some extent, and hitting stuff and scoring sweet kills is insanely satisfying. The gameplay at its core is fairly simple, but in that simplicity is a great deal of depth. Depth in mechanical skill, team compositions, execution, and so on.This game, honestly, is incredible at what it sets out to do. But again, playing with a friend is the way to go.Plus, buying the game nets you all current heroes and future heroes, and considering the relatively cheap price, one can consider that a pretty decent deal."

If you take a look at the ""tier"" list of champions, there are some champions that are overall 'really good' but there aren't any champions that are 'really bad'. For example, in the C-tier you have Jumong but I've seen Jumongs out-play many a Varesh, who is in the S-tier.The community is generally pretty good. Sometimes, if you're playing a champion from a 'higher tier', you'll get BMers saying, ""Oh, you're just playing a broken champion,"" or, ""X is just the same as Y from LoL."" Sorry? I think this is the caustic mentality that comes from Dota2 and LoL, and I don't think it's bad at all in Battlerite.

76561198000799183,Recommended,504370,31223640,Posted: 18 April,all,ArmoredBras,"Battlerite is what you get when you keep only the good PvP parts from a mmorpg or a moba, is fast paced action with the right balance of skill, precision and strategy.[ GAMEPLAY ]It's not the easiest competitive game to jump in at first, each character have 6 unique abilities (+ basic attack) which might not seem a lot, but when put in battle for the first times is easy to forget which one does what and it often result in spamming your way through the first maches (which is fun nontheless).  It doesn't take long though to get a grip on a character and on the general way you should play the game. In any case is clear that the skill ceiling for this game is very high which is a good thing.At the moment there are 20 different characters and they are in my opinion all beatifully crafted, there isn't one that is boring or shallow, some of them are more easier at first but all of them are pretty hard to master to perfection. Also, the twist of this game is that any match is composed of 3-5 rounds and at the start of each of them you get to chose 1 of 3 pre-determined upgrades for your abilities (called ""Battlerites""), this allows you to craft a slightly different strategy or playstyle for each match depending on your needs (damage, surivability, mobility, etc). This upgrade system is well though and increases the gameplay depth by a good amount. Another intresting choice is the use of the fog of war for both enemies and allies, I really wasn't expecting it but I find it very refreshing.So, the gameplay (in my opinion) is on point, maybe it will not suit your taste, but it seems clear what the devs wanted to achieve with this game and I personally think they did it.The only thing I can really complain about is the lack of an ingame signal system like ""go there"", ""danger in that spot"" or ""kill that guy"". It's not essential but sometimes I feel the need to comunicate this way (maybe because I'm used to play Lol).[ GAME BALANCE ]In regards of the game balance it seemed to me at first that some characters were more powerfull than others, but after many more hours of play I'm not sure anymore which is supposedly stronger, every match is clear that the ability of the player to use it trumps everything else by a long shot. Some character are for sure (at least a bit) stronger than others because balancing this kind of games is very tricky, but I think this can really show only when top players are competing.[ MATCH MAKING ]The matchaking system is fine, the wait times are pretty short (a couple of minutes usually) for both 2v2 and 3v3, I never had connection or lag problems and is rare to find toxic people. Even when good and bad players get paired together is unusual to witness strong verbal abuse.The thing I would like to be changed though is the fact that you cna't queue as 2 for the 3v3 ranked games.Another thing (which is not a real problem now, but seems it will be when the game meta starts settling in) is the lack of a pick and ban system for matches. Queuing as your favourite champ is fun but in ranked matches I think that picks and counter picks will start to play a major role in hte future, otherwise it's just luck being paired with an enemy character you counter (or vice-versa). Maybe a traditional pick and ban system is not suitable for this game and they will probably have to come up with something. In the meantime the meta isn't yet established and there is no need for it, it's everybody's game and experimenting is the norm.[ GRAPHICS ]I didn't really like Wow and Torchlight's art style that much, but I think Stunlock Studio pulled it off very well.I really like the character design, color palette, animations and textures, nothing stands outs too much but in a good way. For me the aestethics of the game are well executed and they suit with the overall spirit of the game.The interface is not confusing but I don't really have any major praise for it, it just works. The one complain I have is that there is too much space from your character to your abilities at the bottom of your screen, therefore looking at your cooldowns is often a problem. I would like for this reason to have maybe little icons ontop or under your character to show which abilities are recharging.-- CONCLUSIONS --In my opinion Battlerite is a really good game for a specific audience of competitive players and hits the spot in almost every aspect. I will have to see if it will keep being fun even after hundreds of hours like other major competitive games, but for what I have seen so far it has all the cards to do so.8.5 / 10"

,Recommended,504370,26707768,"Posted: 19 November, 2016",all,MGGAR:A I Dr. Robo Jesus P.hD,"If you’ve ever enjoyed a teamfight in a MOBA, I can guarantee you’ll get a kick out of Battlerite. That’s a bold opening statement, but Battlerite distills those clashes into tense, 10 – 15 minute matches where knowledge and reaction speeds are equally vital. Even if you wouldn’t touch a MOBA with a ten foot barge pole, this might still be for you.Battlerite is Stunlock Studios’ follow up to Bloodline Champions, with the same basic structure – and the essence of many of the heroes – ported over. That means it’s a topdown game in which you fight in teams using abilities triggered via a skill bar. The game’s played either 2v2 or 3v3, with a best of 5 round structure. Each of the 15 heroes has 6 unique abilities, including an ‘ultimate’ that’s especially powerful but requires an energy pool to be filled first by using other abilities. There are also two additional EX moves that use that same energy pool, which are usually alternate versions of normal abilities with souped up damage and/or added effects, though some of them are entirely new. It’s an idea borrowed from fighting games like Street Fighter, and it fits perfectly. On top of that, at the start of each round you get to pick one of three battlerites, each of which enhances an ability (or provides some other buff) that tailors your champion to a certain playstyle over the course of the game.There’s no denying things are overwhelming at first, even for veterans of Dota/League/Smite or WoW’s Arena. It’s a strange feeling, being catapulted back to the equivalent period of my Dota career where every hero and spell was a complete unknown. There’s a tutorial that does a decent job of showing you the ropes for one champion, but you’ll need at least a basic idea of what all of them do before you can start to excel. You’ll lose your first few matches, and likely keep losing every time you try a new champion. I wouldn’t have it any other way.For a start, losing is fun! Unlike with Dota’s hour long slogs, Battlerite’s brevity makes facing up against a much better team far less demoralising. In 10 minutes you’ll be in another game, and this time you’re going to remember to use that ability you keep forgetting about. There’s no XP or items to worry about either, meaning you’re just as powerful as your opponents from start to finish. The level playing field means there’s always the possibility that a great play can turn the tide, imbuing every match with a tension that’s sometimes lacking from the game’s inspirations.The fact that practically every ability (and every default attack) is a skill shot makes those game-changing plays far more prevalent, too. Of course, every hero has at least one mobility spell as well, meaning skilful dodges are a possibility as well as skilful attacks. Spectating from beyond the grave as two experienced players dance around each other is a treat to watch, as they anticipate and counter their opponent’s moves. It’s testament to Battlerite’s future as an esport, which the devs have said they’re keen on pursuing once they’ve grown a big enough community. I’ve no doubt that there’s enough depth here to sustain a competitive scene. Beginners might struggle, but that’s part and parcel of any game with a skill ceiling as high as Battlerite’s appears to be.Let’s talk about the champions themselves. It’s a diverse line-up, as you’d hope: stealthy murder frogs fight alongside time owls, spirits, gunslingers, trolls and more. Impressively, I’m yet to find one I haven’t enjoyed – which is remarkable considering I only play about 5 heroes in Dota. Despite my usual preference for agile damage dealers, I’ve found tanky characters and support focussed ones are just as much fun to play. That’s partly because every character is an agile damage dealer to some extent, and they’re all capable of holding their own when it comes down to a 1v1. Also, healing allies is challenging and engaging for exactly the same reasons that damaging enemies is, since you need to accurately aim your healing abilities.There’s good design baked into the core of the game, and battlerites are the icing on the cake. Choosing just one of the three available to you at the start of each round is an interesting strategic decision in itself. Do you want Croak’s poison spit to heal you for twice as much, or do you want to move 15% faster while stealthed? Do you want to increase your healing by 15%, or do 20% more damage to low health enemies? Many champions have particularly powerful synergies between different battlerites, which are a thrill to discover for yourself. I’ve just begun shaping my choices around which champions the other team has picked – there’s no drafting phase, unlike most MOBAs – introducing yet another layer of skill to the game.The good design decisions don’t stop there. All of the damage numbers are kept low, so it’s easy to keep track of how powerful each ability is and the impact that taking certain battlerites has on them. The champions’ health pools are all at that sweet spot between ‘boringly large’ and ‘liable to explode in 1 hit’, preventing slow wars of attrition while allowing abilities to feel impactful. The arenas are small, but not too small, with an orb that periodically spawns in the centre that grants a bonus to the team who destroys it. It’s a neat way of focussing the action, with many decisive plays revolving around a well timed ‘last hit’ on the orb.So, what could be improved? For a game that’s only just opened up for public early access, there are remarkably few obvious issues. I’ve a minor quibble with how small the arrows are that indicate where off screen players are – I didn’t even notice they were there until a friend pointed them out to me, several hours in. A more detailed tutorial would be welcome, to explain how the orb mechanic works as well as highlighting the synergy between each champion’s abilities: knowing how to combo certain skills together can make a massive difference. I’d also like to see the tooltips for each ability update as you pick battlerites. Oh, and the 2 games I played with the chat enabled were downright toxic. You’ll probably want to leave it off, and ideally find some more amiable friends to play with. None of that holds the experience back significantly – it’s mostly a case of making the game more accessible to players that don’t have a history with MOBAs. Even then, a couple of hours should be more than enough to learn the basics.As with Dota, Battlerite’s already starting to feel like a different beast as I rack up hours in it. Improving at one element of the game frees up another to focus on, allowing me to incorporate more and more information into the decisions I’m making at every second. I’m not sure how deep this rabbit hole goes, but I’m hoping I’ll still be exploring it for many months to come.Edit 1: Still in love with this"

For anyone that enjoyed the WoW arena format and wants a more engaging combat system, this is the go-to game.There are 20 champions in the game currently, with each having a unique playstyle. Battlerites, which are the perks that you choose before each round, are a bit lacking, but the Devs have managed to make quite a few characters have more than one viable build.The playerbase is small, although that is visible only in the ranks of Diamond/Champion/Grand Champion.That is all not too surprising because the game is in early access and behind a paywall. The price is well worth it, especially on sale,  because it includes all current and future champions. This is crucial for people who like to play on and off without the burden of being left behind with locked content.Cosmetics are still not that diverse, but that is not to say that they aren't working on that too. They just did a graphical update for a champion as well as a gorgeous legendary skin.The recent addition of Bakko Brawl confirms that they are exploring new fun game modes which is always nice. This particular one promotes the use of cast cancel, an integral game mechanic for higher levels of play.The community has its gatherings on Reddit and Discord and so do some of the Devs. They answer questions, take feedback, post Devblogs weekly and even stream sometimes.

I bought 2 copies of the game thinking I can gift it to a friend from NA but rip that. The region block messed things up for us and I ended giving it to a local friend. I've played this game, yes. Enjoyed the game, yes. Im not a hardcore​ player, so doing pvp in a simple yet challenging way Is too fun for me. Also if you're tired of MOBAs, then you might enjoy this as well. It gives you the same vibe but with a different gameplay. I'm still hoping that there will be more content to be released in the future. Because tbh, each battle have 3 rounds and more likely, itll only last for 15-20 mins max per battle. But if the battle gets intense, 20 mins is sometimes not enough. Dx THANKS FOR THE LITE KEYS, I CAN FINNALY PLAY IT WITH​ A FRIEND. I'm sure the devs are working thoroughly into​ transitioning it to f2p for more player base.

,Recommended,504370,33323446,Posted: 6 July,all,lenkek,"Very unique, competitive, and fun game. WASD movement, skills are really skillshots, and fast rounds.It's an Arena Brawler, not like LoL, DotA, and HotS where it has 3 lanes that has creeps and towers. It's like a colosseum, no towers or creeps, an open area with thats is pretty suitable for this type of gameplay with skillshots, WASD movement, and fast rounds.For casuals, this game is great, you have daily and weekly quests, and alongside to new players, there's achievements that they can unlock. All of these daily quests, weekly quests, and achievements, you will gain rewards such as cosmetic chests and ingame currency.Everyone has an equal playing field, no runes or masteries that give you a head start in the game, also no buying items. Instead, at the beginning of each round everybody has an option to chose 1 out of the 3 ""battlerites"" given to them for their character which allow you to customize your abilities and playstyle.Combat is really fluid, thanks to WASD and skillshots, every character's kit seems to fit well with the gamestyle. The game is easy to grasp, but hard and rewarding to master.Every champion is viable, just certain team compositions are not good against other compositions. This game's balance is okay, no character is broken since every character can be countered. Characters are more balanced in 3v3s than in 2v2s, since you have more variety of champions to play with and against. If you're looking for the most balanced game mode, it's going to be 3v3s, but not much people play 3v3s.Battlerite's playerbase is okay, nothing you need to worry about, there's 2.5k people playing each day, its not going to decline, it's in Early Access, its completely fine.Nothing wrong with ranked matchmaking during this stage of the game. Only 2.5k players playing the game each day during peak times, you can expect going against the same people a couple times. Yes you will be matched with others higher than you, but if you dont win against them, then you dont deserve to get up to that rank, so don't complain. If you dont want to go against people higher than you, you use ""Strict Matchmaking"" which sets you to play with others are your rank, but you'll have to compensate for the time to search for players at your rank.For only $20, for all the champions (including all the future ones), and for 400+ hours I have on it, this game is worth the money. More features are to come, watching this game develop since October, 2016, its a very promising game. I have fun each day playing it."

I was a huge fan of BLC and sadly the fanbase died due to lack of publicity etc. But the rebirth, Battlerite is just so polished, so much more accessible and so well done. This is a 100% skill based game, literally zero RNG (not even crit chance) no grinding for anything, you just pick who you'd like to play and you queue. If you lose, it's because you got outplayed, if you win -- it's because you played better than the other team. There's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t here, it's all 100% skill.You decide the outcome of every single match and it's so incredibly addicting. Especially because, even if you are in a 1v2/1v3 situation. You know there's a chance you can win if you play it right. You have to try this game, it's face paced, intense, top-down arena action and quite honestly, the best game I've played in a long time. There's no hidden OP characters, everything can be countered, everyone can be outplayed and you are only limited by your own skill cieling.Let alone the community is amazing, the community in BLC was never toxic and as of now, it's the same here. If someone in BLC disconnected during the match, everyone would simply wait for them to reconnect, or just decide on a 2v2 match up. It's amazing and so rare to find nowadays.10/10 -- I see nothing wrong here."

If you have any experience at all with any MOBA or even MMOs, you should be able to pick up this game instantly.Although the game will be launched for free in 2017, buying the early access gives you all future champions for free without the need to unlock them. Ever. This makes purchasing the EA extremely worthy. In the case the game blows up in 2017, which I bet it will, you'll have a huge advantage for not having to grind or buy in game currencies to unlock any champions. This $20 is a no brainer."

(lots of people quitting, losing quite a bit of friends to play with, and almost capping out individually therefore, losing incentive to keep on playing)game is not completely finished but as far as early access games go this is as polished as it gets. There are inevitable flaws with the matchmaking system but it's a work in progress, or so I've heard.**there is a STEEP learning curve**If you're completely new to the moba type of games (for the lack of the better term), you will have to put hours and hours to learn how to play.For those with previous experience it will provide a great challenge and fun finding suiting hero and honing your skills with him.Hero specializations are a very real thing in this game and is almost required if you aim to reach the top. Even tho there are certain ""roles"" you can find yourself in, choosing and maining a hero is almost inevitable and you'll more likely than not find yourself in such a position.The gameplay is there, teamwork is very real, cosmetics are also top notch and they are being built upon (with various holiday themes and what have you). Hero pool is being increased (albeit at a very slow pace, because balance is a key thing in this game)Bang for buck is definitely there, hardly gonna find better product at this price range.For the doubters f2p is scheduled somewhere mid year and I have a hard time believing someone will refuse to give it a go.Is there a chance you'll might start to lose interest like I did after you put 800h in, quite possibly.

If you play for 15 minutes you get 14 minutes of action and fun.-Some really cool mechanics. Ive played mobas for over 20k hours, and there are some mechanics that are even fresh to me.-This game works beautifully as a competitive game.-Access replays of the previous games, edit them with an in game tool and share it with the community, really well done system.-All heroes unlocked from the start. %100 playable.-Great price tag.Cons:-The community is possibly the worst one out there. Including league of legends, dota 2 and cs:go.-Rarely gets updates, really hurts the balance and the replayability of the game.-Toxic players dont get banned. They only review bizarre cases, like a player getting report 100 times a week for being racist etc. People who throw games or flame never get banned, I mean NEVER. They simply wont review every case until the games full release.-Some heroes have somewhat unpolished visuals.-Some annoying glitches, which become an actual con because of the rare update case.Bonus:-Microtransactions (cosmetics only).-You cant listen to music while playing versus Jade (people who play the game will get this :^)).If you can afford to spend money on any game you like, definitely buy and try it out.

,Not Recommended,504370,31272062,Posted: 21 April,all,punished,"TL;DR - Although playable, I can't recommend it in it's current state.Okay gameplay, nice graphics, well optimized enough that it can run on low end computers, customizations (although limited) are goodBad matchmaking, bad ranking system, bad community, unoptimized/bad mechanics, noticeable balance problems, more luck based than skill based, player base is dying.LONG READ:I regret paying for this game after seeing what it looks like in it's current state.As simple and fun as the gameplay might be, most of the mechanicss are still as broken as my hand after hitting the desk in anger and frustration because of the♥♥♥♥♥♥happening in it.Ranking system is a complete mess; you're not ranking up based on how well you play or how many points you made in the entire match, no, ranking is basically win based. You get an empty bar, you win a match, bar fills with a tiny orange-red chunk of predetermined static value that is always the same for every win; what happens if you lose a match, same thing but in reverse, you have your bar sucked back down to where you started from.Games are more luck based than skill based and the matchmaking is just bad. You can easily get matched with a bad team and no matter how well you play, you'll end up violated because your team either has badly matched champions or the enemy team has a pair of champions that are next to impossible to beat when they're put together. Then there are also those who lose on purpouse to get deranked so they can troll lower ranked players.Ranking is frustrating as you waste an entire day playing, growing in rank, then the next day it's all back to where you started from because you're matched up with bad teams, derankers or ragequitters; leaving you with no choice but to either continue playing and lose or just forfeit the match; either way it's a rank loss.Balance problems are visible as well; one of them being the fact that you can match up 2 champions in the same team which are next to impossible to beat together, or champions who have easily abusable invincibility frames and you can close to spam their abilities which get you a few frames of invincibility during castingThe community isn't exactly the best either as most are going to write in chat ''easy xD'' ''gg'' ''git gud'' ''ez'' whenever they win a round or the entire match but when they lose, they're going to swear and insult you; also there are quite a bunch of ragequitters who leave the match after they're killed once.Unless you enjoy being constantly angry and frustrated, don't buy the game. Best you can do is just wait it out until the early access is over and the game gets released as a F2P title or play it when it get a free weekend pass."

Balance changes are quite often questionable, although the playing field remains pretty even. A much needed update to the menu and UI has been in the works for months. It should NOT take this long to push an update like this. Every update moving forward seems to be bringing remodels to current champions, which I'd argue from my outside perspective are not worth the time/talent investment. New champions are incredibly rare. Becoming invested in this game is punishing due to constantly being let down.Insanely toxic community if you queue with randoms. Play with friends or disable chat. Why does it have to come down to disabling chat? There is no penalty for leaving unranked games. There is no sevre penalty for leaving ranked games. I have not heard of anyone getting banned. I have seen people say terrible, terrible things and nothing has been done about it despite reports.The game would thrive from strong ties to the esports scene, but is struggling to say the least. Efforts are made to encourage these ties, but it feels like a losing battle.As for the ""playerbase"" issue, I don't feel that's much of a problem. It's never a struggle to find games, unless you're queuing at 4am and your idea of a struggle is a three minute wait at that hour. Going F2P will boost the playerbase, but will do little to solve the retention problem. This game gets repetitive faster than an average MOBA, but has a fraction of the rate of change through updates. People are noticing this and losing interest."

But it isn't, there's no item to buy in game, no farming, this can be boring for some people, but if you're looking for a light face paced gameplay, then this is the best, since you don't have to farm until 30-40 mins into the game.Of course as a MOBA player myself, I do find farming gameplay missing, if there's a gamemode where you can get golds for each kill or rounds won where you can spend them on items, that would be interesting, but then it will remove the ""fairness"" after each round.For now there's only a handful of heroes that you can play sadly, but it will take some time for you to learn them all, similar to Dota 2 heroes.Short conclusion:Get this game if you want to have short games where a match would only last around 10 mins.In overall I would recommend this game."

It also includes very unique characters, abilities, and classes similar to ones you would see in moba games.  Athough this game does not include towers, minions, objectives, items and all that jazz so do not confuse it with the moba genre of games like league of legends or Dota.  It is a simple concept yet the execution of it brings you some intense and complex gameplay.

I've put in a few hours and already ran in to a few really competent players, and the combat feels so polished and deep. Listen to what people are saying. It's great.Turn DOTA2 or LoL into a top down shooter and remove all the MOBA junk. No need to worry about farming or item builds or any strange mastery/rune/whatever system outside of the game. It's fast paced arena combat.As someone looking for an alternative to Overwatch because I haven't been enjoying shooters lately and DOTA2/LoL because I don't have the time for long games, this really scratched my itch. Matches are 10-15 minutes depending on how close the fights are. It's freeing to not have to sit down and dedicate an hour to what might end up being a totally unenjoyable stomp.At this point, after a few hours, the heroes feel balanced. They each have a very similar set of skills in function but in practice they play very differently. It makes it easier to pick up and learn a new hero but it's definitely going to take time to really master.If you're looking for a fast paced game that's accessible but incredibly deep in terms of mechanics and micro, pick this up. I can't wait to see what new content they put out in the near future. Get in on the ground floor of this one, because I can see people getting extremely good extremely fast."

By this I mean, it is a spiritual successor to Bloodline Champions. Because of this, the goal of the game is very much more focused in the developers eyes (I believe) and this is helpful because instead of being an aimless project that will only get bigger with no true goal, this is aiming to become one of the most fast-paced e-sports of the next few years.

,Recommended,504370,25711622,"Posted: 26 September, 2016",all,Khnok,"VIDEO VERSION:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDHXhEjvvQMINTRO:From Stunlock, the creators of Bloodline Champions, one of my teenagehood games next to League of Legends and World Of Warcraft, comes an Arena based PvP game with fast-paced combat, well-designed champions and a mix of what we most love of the best games out today.Battlerite comes as a new promise that has already conquered passionate fans among all kinds of communities. From comparing it to World Of Warcraft’s famous Arena system, it has already hooked many that were looking for a similar experience. But does it really pay off as such? Let’s take a look first.CHARACTERS:From being an Early Access game, BattleRite initiates with a quite big variety of characters. 15 different champions divided in 3 different roles: Melee, Ranged and Support. These champions can be EVEN separated by its own mechanics, Ranged characters can go from Archers to Casters, Melee from Tanks to Assassins and Supports can go even further, from Melee, Archers and Casters! Which means that mastering a role, isn’t going to pay off for all heroes! AMAZING!.. What? It’s not something new to you?Oh, so what if you add into this mix a Talent Tree system for each round of the match? That means that countering an opponent is not just picking the right composition but also choosing wisely the buffs that you want to apply on your own abilities! Talents, or what they call “Battlerites”, will appear in front of you every round, right at the beginning. Champions can choose up to 3 talents and every round is a different talent, similar to Heroes Of The Storm talents system, but instead of in-match leveling it is earned every round. The first round talents will differ from the second, and up until fifth round, where you choose up to 2 talents to power up your ultimate ability. Overall, characters can be built into more aggressive, defensive or even mobility depending on each encounter you face.OH, and LET ME TELL YOU about these encounters!GAMEPLAY:I agree that comparing Battlerite’s Arena to World Of Warcraft is not a bad thing, but I believe it went beyond that point! As an experienced retired WoW player… cof cof- I know, I’m old. I’ve played on a daily basis it’s arena and it feels very nostalgic to play a game that reminds me of that, but it goes beyond my expectations when it brings talents into the middle of the match!It’s also important to mention it’s MoBA camera, what we could call over the top point of view. Clearly for moba players it is easier to play that way, but it also affects how the combat works. Even though some WoW players were used to drag their camera away in a similar way, watching the whole battleground from above and being unable to see what is out of your line of sight, “fog of war”, changes the whole game, you have no option but to get used to it and appreciate this new way of battling.Another interesting change for Moba and WAW players is the Aiming and Movement system. Basic Attacks, some abilities and ultimates are cast where your cursor is, like a OverTheTop-Shooter game. Which means that pointing and clicking won’t work if you are used to that like me! You might struggle, but it feels so well balanced with the pace of the combat that you will easily master in 2 to 3 AI matches. Considering the movement system, as a MoBA-like game, it might blow your mind. It follows FPS PC logic, you move your character with WASD keys! We all know it’s not something new, but it is a MUST for this fast-paced arena game. For some players, another mechanic to adjust.JESSICA: BUT KHNOK WHAT IF THE ENEMY TEAM PICKS 2 HEALERS AND WE CAN’T FINISH THEM OFF! IS IT AN ENDLESS BATTLE?Don’t be afraid little Jessica, BattleRite has everything planned with their Suddendeath system! Back when I played WoW, some arena matches could go up to 40 minutes! NO KIDDING, some compositions consisted of 2 tanks who could self-heal too much, 2 healers or even kiters who would kill you of boredom! But here, after 2 minutes of combat the arena enters a Suddendeath mode where a circular fog engulfs the whole arena! DELIGHTFUL!SKINS, CHESTS & CURRENCY:As expected from most games since the OUTSTANDING FEVER OF TEAM FORTRESS 2 HATS, this game has skins for every character and brings also special skins for their weapons. The best way to obtain those are by leveling your account, champions and doing quests. Wait… for those familiar with Overwatch and Heroes Of The Storm, Chests and Quests to earn something are their territory of BUSINESS! HOW DARE YOU, STUNLOCK! It’s fine! They implemented both systems in a way that only benefits it’s players. From doing quests you earn chests and from chests you get skins, weapons, poses and icons! The chests goes from Silver to Gold. Silver guarantees a Rare item out of it, and Gold guarantees a Epic drop.Also, some people might ask if there are microtransactions on this game, and the answer is yes, but it works the same way as Overwatch, you can buy packs of Gold Chests. So, NO PAY 2 WIN strats here!Battle Coins and Tokens can be earned by winning sequences of matches and getting duplicate items, also, like Heroes Of The Storm, you get bonuses from leveling your specific champion, which rewards you on mastering it.CONCLUSION:**Considering that I played this game for something close to 5 hours, and that I will definitely play hundreds of hours more with 1 to 2 friends. The 25 dollars equivalent of the time spent, is totally worth  compared to Battlerite’s 20 dollars price. **In my opinion, Battlerite became a must on my steam the moment Stunlock recreated such beloved style of arena game and, by evolving it into its own original piece, they showed the world that a smaller studio, great ideas combined and an accessible price can ALSO develop a STEAM HIT!Lifehack Artilhe TIME x MONEY:http://lifehacker.com/calculating-the-value-of-time-how-much-is-your-time-re-1749954358"

,Recommended,504370,33946698,Posted: 1 August,all,dollar scratchers,"This game puts you right into the action of what seems to play like your typical top down MOBA. There are a decent variety of champions to choose from and each having their own strengths and weaknesses as well as having counter picks. The ability to choose ""Battlerites"" between each round to adapt to your match up allows a deeper level of play each round.The only downswing to this game is that there is unfortunately a small community and the matchmaking system is not particularly balanced. There is a strict matchmaking selection for you but clicking that while queueing almost makes it impossible to find a game once you're around Platinum to Diamond level.Overall, I think this is an incredibly fun game to play whenever you need something else to play that is fast paced and right into the action."

Which items do I buy? All of this to prepare for one or two teamfights that decide the game...In Battlerite, you won't be spending 20-40 minutes mindlessly farming to get gear so that you can teamfight; instead you spawn in, you fight, you live or die, and you repeat. That's right, balance and strategic 2v2 and 3v3 teamfights where every ability down to your basic attacks are skillshots. Your mechanical prowess will carry you through every situation in this game. Instead of snowballing them with gold, snowball them with your skills.Pros:-Control scheme is fantastic... better than any moba.-Fast-paced skill-based non-stop action.-Variety of character types to choose from; there is someone for everyone.-Solo Queue is separate from Ranked 2v2s and Ranked 3v3s.-Ranked Teams are automatically created for each unique party.-Very welcoming community with lots of great times to be had together.-Active tournament scene.Cons:-You don't own it yet.Can't wait to see you in the Arena!

You constantly get matched against better people, and they will dominate you, I can guarantee.Ranked mode could be a solution, but not in terms of team ranked, since the matchmaking only takes the teams rank into consideration, so most of the time your team will not be facing equally skilled opponents.Of course, at the moment the playerbase is small, which makes matchmaking harder, but thats why I recommend that you wait until the game is out, and more people will play it. When you are facing equal opponents, the game is already a lot of fun. Its just the stomping that I hate. At the moment I have a whopping 20 (!!!) percent win rate, which feels horrible."

The controls are great, killing players and winning feels rewarding. I'll certainly be playing this game as it's very easy to pick up and play a few games with some friends.A couple issues I had with it, they are minor and this is really me just nit picking.- The camera lerping when you move the mouse is disorienting, however, there's a way to disable it in the settings (thank you so much for that)- I wish the characters' abilities had more creativity to them especially the ultimates.- No controller support (This seems like the perfect game for a controller, no?)- Balancing issues (I've picked a few characters that felt woefully underpowered.)"

Imagine a MOBA, but without the tedious gold/experience farming and the item-based systems that lend themselves to snowballing. Imagine a MOBA where every autoattack required aim to hit with, an entirely skill-based MOBA where, even if down to rounds to one, you can still come back by changing your own strategy and gameplay. Battlerite, the spiritual successor to Bloodline Champions, is easily the best MOBA I've ever played, indeed it is the only redeeming title in a largely stagnant genre. Great yet simple gameplay, action that gets your heart pounding, and the best thing is that even if losing badly, three rounds only take a maximum of 6 minutes. Short and sweet, and for those of us who already grind for money 8 hours a day, it represents a needed and welcome change to the MOBA genre, filled with titles where you farm for a minimum of 20 minutes before the teamfights actually start. This is the MOBA genre's saving grace."
,Not Recommended,504370,31145584,Posted: 14 April,all,PhoenixRhapsody,"The core mechanics in the game are solid, it's engaging to play, but the balance of the heroes is hilariously imbalanced. There are still 3 OP characters that win 90% of the time in a skilled player's hands.The way the game is set up there are a few major things to consider per character to decide their strength. First is damage output. A lot of characters, like Ashka, Jade, and Iva all have absurd burst. They can also kite. They are strong for those reasons alone, but then you add in decent projectile speeds, high AoE, or CC and you have a very strong character.Secondly is healing. Burst healing is infinitely better than delayed healing, meaning that unless you're dealing with someone that can't aim or outmaneuver you, your slow heals aren't going to give you much chance. Certain healers have massive healing potential, like Poloma, and she can even prevent damage, but it is fast and strong healing. She's absurdly overpowered for that reason.Lastly is attack speed. A few of the characters do not attack fast. Among these there are some that also have weak attack. While that isn't always a limiter, in the cases of slow attacks and weak ones, there needs to be some over-coming factor. Ashka attacks slow, but he hits hard. Croak attacks fast, but has weaker attacks and toxin DoT. Something that separates them from Varesh is that he only gets effective usefulness if he can successfully combo his abilities, relying on heavy synergy to be effective. This stacks against him with his slow attacks speed, which makes him woefully weak overall.Without a more effective look at balancing the characters to provide either burst or sustained DPS/utility, most of the characters in this game are not going to be competitive or even casually playable."

A week later I tried to log in and there was no one on.I jumped over to DoTA2, but the matches were entirely too long and not quite what I was looking for as far as combat.From there I played League of Legends, though a bit more fast-paced and containing other game modes for more intimate matches - nothing came close to those couple dozen hours I played on Bloodline Champions.In mumble one day, I describe Bloodline Champions and someone tells me about its successor, Battlerite.Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ thank god this game exists.  I don't have the fortitude to sit through long MOBA matches and the high-octane pace of this game suits me perfectly.  I may not have the fortitude for MOBA matches, but I can bang out games in Battlerite for -hours-.The differences between 2v2 and 3v3 matches are vast enough that changing between can refresh your experience for a few hours a clip.Although I am glad I paid for this game, I truly hope it goes free so we can get more folks playing.  This game is competetive enough to stand beside other free-to-play competetive games.The only feedback I have regarding this game is the presentation, which I see they are vigorously working on.Since this is arena-style gameplay, I feel the game can be presented with a little more punch.  When I lock into a queue with my desired hero, why not a little voice clip announcing their name?  The same goes for round transitions, why not announce it like a fighting game?A lot of Smash Clones take this from the Smash Bros. formula, but I feel it's an integral part of getting you interested in the characters.  Constantly reinforcing the character's names helps new players learn the names of your cast, and reminds the forgetful players.  Their names are also missing from the scoreboards as well.  As these are new characters to all of us, having their name present or accessible at all times is important to that reinforcement.I'd also like character-specific bindings if possible.Aside from my lengthy nitpick, this game is absolutely wonderful and fills in a huge disparity  between MOBA's and Fighters.  It can act as a bridge, or a middle ground.  This game feels balanced well, new heroes are steadily coming in - the designs are great and devs seem to have their ear to the players.10/10.5"

You get to play the game before.These 2 reason are why you should buy the game before it goes F2P, but these are my own personal opinions. Now the reason I like this game in general is that it reminds me of other games I used to play, ex. Torchlight 2, Diablo, League of Legends, Smite, and quite a few more. I love this game because of the mobility in champions, the fighting style and the fact you can get new gear and mounts, of course they are only for visual effects, but its still a very nice feeling of getting one of the nice items and bragging to friends.This game does have a few downfalls and that, for me atleast this game sometimes does freeze in the middle of the game  but it isnt frequent and also sometimes you can feel the need to rage at this game. (Atleast I do)This game has Quick Match and League play so Normal games and Ranked Matches you can do 2v2s or 3v3s with friends or not, From my experience everyone in this game has been very friendly to me or my peers, I even made a few new friends along the way.

If you are familiar with BLC, you will see the core gameplay is the same. The game play is slowed down a tad, perspective changed slightly from BLC, but overall makes it feel like a better game and more accessable. I was only a casual BLC player, but I can already tell playing Battlerite was much easier to get into.To summerize the gameplay, it feels like the core meta game of Arena inWorld of Warcraft, with action twin-stick shooter mechanics. Everything is a skill shot and there are many cooldowns to manage. With counters, shields, teleports, CC, etc.  It makes the game very skill based with lots of room to grow and improve just by landing the shots alone, nevermind cooldown management and timings.One major feature changed from BLC was the new ""Battlerite"" system. Each match is a best of 5. At the begining of each round you choose a ""Battlerite"". Which is essentially a talent that will buff or add effects to your abilities. Much like leveling up in ""Heroes of the Storm."" It adds a little sense of progression and just ramps up the action.You play these matches in a 2v2 or 3v3 format. Overall it becomes a very satisfying experience. One round you can get totally destroyed, and turn it all around the next by playing better and smarter. There is great satisfaction to taking a round away from an opposing team who was obviously dominating the first two.While some BLC fanatics might be off put by some of the changes they made, I feel the overall experience is better for players new to this style of game, and BLC fans will just be happy to have it back in some form or another.Currently it is in Early Access, but definitely feels like a complete game. Just missing some of the social features and game modes from their orignal game, Bloodline Champions. Early Access will pretty much be mostly for getting these missing features ready, more champions to add, and of course balance feedback. It will launch with what we are assuming a traditional F2P model, with free champion rotations that you have to unlock with money or ingame currency.  Buying into Early Access now essentially gives you a MASSIVE pre-order bonus. All Champions free, forever! Pretty sweet deal for having faith in Stunlock studios.

76561198040266490,Recommended,504370,30349684,Posted: 5 March,all,RazorAce,"Essentially the bane of my gaming commitment.After many years of playing BLC since Launch (Bloodline Champions, the purported prequel to Battlerite - which is not completely off the mark), one would be able to realise just how good or bad you are at the game and how much potential one has left to exploit - which is not a lot since I am not all naturally gifted at twitch-based games.Experiencing all the frustration of toxic players, tilting on ranked ladder, low player-base, lack of work being done to the game - somehow I can't help myself clicking on that icon time and time again (more true for BLC than Battlerite, but both applies).So I ask myself, why? Why do I keep coming back when I might have found, objectively, far more enjoyment from watchinglolcats.comupdate in real time?I believe the answer lies in the immediate enjoyment players are able to obtain from the game unique to the MOBA-Esque gameplay Battlerite provides and the unique depth as well as impartial ""fairness"" of the gameplay.It has the advantage of shorter games, less teamwork reliance (more possibility for carrying at a lower skill level) and twitch-based gameplay mechanics over traditional MOBAs like LoL or DOTA. When 4 or 5 players are feeding on your team, your chances of success is much lower than just 2 or even 1 player in your team being a gorilla. A part of the twitch-based gameplay mechanics means that those with good natural reflexes will largely have an advantage over those who don't, which can be justified as something to feel good about due to Darwin's theory of natural selection. This is where one would simply conclude that teamwork is really less enjoyable than playing solo, and thus the lack of reliance on teamwork before players start to become mechanically sound is a huge bonus to those frustrated being stuck with players with poor mechanics that utterly detracts from the enjoyment of the game in a competitive sense.However, I believe this game faces a huge hurdle in the time to come as it needs to one way or another increase player retention. The lack of sensible content update relative to the infrastructure BLC already has built up for Battlerite certianly does not aid their plight as typical menu content such as match history, player database (for ladder or just in general), general chat channels, detailed player stats, interactive in-game menu and various other extended features such as live observer mode are either seemingly not worked on or developed very slowly since CBT, which has been over half a year since.Which brings to the final point I'd like to address - the depth of gameplay. I came across an interesting perspective which suggested that the lack of player retention rate is due to the lack of improvement players are able to make through learning strategic information such as champion skills or map distance etc etc. I can confidently say that this is most certainly not true for the majority of the playerbase. Most players suffer from the misconception that Battlerite is by-in-large an extension of team-fights from traditional MOBAs, which to an extent, is not wrong. However, the know-how to fighting a team-fight to the absolute best of ability is completely different. In a typical lane-pushing MOBA, you have an alternative choice - to push the lane, kill minions and win the game, the ultimate goal one could objectively declare is not to kill your opponents. However, Battlerite is different, you are essentially forced to fight - either kill or be killed.Now, once players realise that, the way they play changes greatly and a lot of psychology is involved. Total health of the team becomes a thing and a huge number of instantaneous but nevertheless, well-informed decisions are required in order to obtain victory. This is where most players fall down or trip up in; they try and do things outside of their role in order to ""carry"" the game and typically would produce counter-productive results against a team with a better read on the personality or intentions than yourself and in the end, punished one way or another for doing so. An example often seen due to the ""scoreboard"" nature of the game is healers trying to deal damage. What they don't realise is, typically for every time they try to deal damage, they are missing out on a chance to heal or cc, and due to game balancing, their damage or reach are generally tweaked so that one would have to completely mechanically out-play the damage dealer in order to come out positive in trades. Not to mention that as healers take damage, they would be eventually forced into a reactive position as one would have to heal him/herself just to stay alive and consistent in total combat output (if one person dies, total output of damage and healing tilts and typically leads to loss especially if a team chooses to soft-reset). However, intuitively, players aren't easily able to accept that not all games are winnable and generally the concept that ""I have to carry the game by doing the job of two players or more"" has been thoroughly ingrained into them by that point. This only leads to a vicious cycle until some miraculous enlightenment or being taught the hard way through repetitive losses.Therefore, many players can enjoy the game for what it appears as, but subjectively looking at the player population that has tried Battlerite as a whole, not many had reached the level where they could appreciate the true depth of the game and the enjoyment derived from that.Thus, I believe it is not the depth of gameplay that needs work on by tweaking gameplay mechanics (as suggested by some players), but rather the solution lies in helping players discover the heart of the competitive gameplay which Battlerite already offers.TL;DR? - Find a better way for intermediate players to progress.Finally, despite the fact that I would recommend the game itself, I cannot, however, recommend the act of purchasing the  as SLS simply cannot convincingly justify the costs for the content they have provided so far - which is not a lot, and the ever increasingly obvious money-grabbing with mounts and cosmetics is becoming alarming when the basis of the game hinges on competitive gameplay rather than the ""casual players"" population."
,Recommended,504370,29639187,Posted: 1 February,all,Rosath,"This game is refreshing and has a good concept.I truly loved the hours I put in so far. Combats are quite balanced, fluid and fun. I love the fact that it's like a MOBA with only the fighting. I guess 1v1 would be fun to see, but 2v2 and 3v3 are there and easier to balance. There's a few champions that are stronger, overall, but it's nothing bad IMO and can be worked with with time.Game will become f2p eventually, so I hesitated before buying it. I don't regret my choice as it's quite fun and I'll have every future champs they get out for free.Leveling is engaging and makes you want to try all the characters to unlock skins. No power attached to them.Downside? There's a lot of complaints about how the devs are not communicating enough, and how the game now seems to be progressing slowly. I'm not a part of the community since long enough to comment on this yet. But it seems important to mention.If you feel like you'd like the game, I recommend you buy it!"

If you pay for this game at this stage you get the entire ~12ish roster of champions (might be a few more or less), and you get to just have fun playing.I wouldn't be surprised if this game ended up free to play, personally I'm not a fan of Micro Transactions inside a game I paid to play, cosmetic or not if I'm paying for a product I'm buying the content not a portion of it. Fights are intense, matches last about 10 minutes depending on how even the sides are, 1 round takes at worst 2.5 minutes, if at worse case you play 5 rounds (first to 3 wins) thats 2.5*5 = 12.5 minutes.TL;DR:Pros:Good game, fun, very skill based,Matches are Short but intense (Avg 7-12minutes)Game ""feels"" balanced (Your character could be statistically under-powered but you can easily outplay your opponent)Art is pretty (Almost Torchlight-esque)Cons:Network issues (Early Access)MicroTransactions in a game you purchased (It's cosmetic currently as you can only buy chests, similar to OverWatch, but it could apply to other content down the pipeline)Fun game, would recommend to people if they're on the fence, but I'll pass on it until it goes Free to Play, or they've stabilized their servers more (rubber banding in a PvP game is no bueno)."

Fighting-game-style zoning.  I find the zoning game incredibly obnoxious.  This is mainly why I don't play fighting games.  When the zoning game is too real, I end up just running in because my patience runs out.2.  Redundant skills.  I know it's probably difficult to design 20 heros with completely unique skill sets with many skills, but that's the problem... I don't feel like each character is unique enough to interest me.3.  Floaty gameplay and lack of skill feedback.  If my skills arn't properly relaying info, I begin to feel like im either missing everything or not having an impact on the match.  I'm OFTEN surprised how much damage I did in the post game stats window.. because you know.. I really didnt think any of my hits were landing.4.  Boring arena.  I'm not an mmo pvp player, therefore the arena maps with no side objectives feel boring to me.  I like to play mind games and strategy, and zoning/relying on pure mechanical skill to win are not the ways I like to win.  I know people say there are mind games in this game, but FOR ME, I feel that as long as the other person tests my patience enough, im going to end up giving htem the win just to get the match over with.5.  Graphics.  I can't pinpoint what it is as I don't really know the names of all the different styles of video game art, but It almost reminds me of diablo 3, and that is one of my all-time most hated games.  I think it ties in to the floaty gameplay, where everything looks and feels too smooth for its own good.I'm still going to recommend the game despite its subjective flaws.  I know there is a market for this type of arena game, and who am I to dissuade them from trying it out. Most people will know immediately if this game appeals to them or not. I hope that I will have a reason to revisit this game in the future as I do feel like it has potential."

,Recommended,504370,25659140,"Posted: 23 September, 2016",all,Xanabanana,"If you're the type of dude who plays overwatch or LoL and love the high of making the occasional 1v3 play I would check this out. This game is pure unadulterated PvP action. I would not call it a moba as it has no npc's nor objectives- if anything I would compare it to Arena PvP in World of Warcraft, but with an Isometric view- also note its way faster paced, and I would say more skill based as there are very few auto-targeted abilities in this game, almost everything is a ""skillshot"" using Moba Terminology.I want to repeat, if you love making those ""Did you see that!?"" plays definitely try this game out. The game does not have a ""play of the game"" system like overwatch, but every game is recorded and allows you to cut a recording (so say you only show the part of the match where you 1v3'd) and then post it on your profile to share with friends and other players.Now, a quick mention that this is essentially an overhaul of Stunlock Studio's Previous Game, Bloodline Champions. Now that game was phenomenal, but it had several underlying issues (cough funcom cough)- this game however has addressed many of them while making it more accessable without hurting the depth of the game. I talk about these toward the bottom in the ""differences between this and BLC"" part of the review.Lets talk about how long it takes to play a match. A match plays in a best of 5 round system, with a timer at the start of the match counting down to an ""overtime"" where a painful fog circles the map to make sure slippery characters can't just stall the match out for too long- it creeps up into a small circle toward the center of the map and ~30 seconds after that it will just begin closing onto the whole map. With that being said you will usually finish a match within 10 minutes, with 20 minutes being an extreme outlier. So this pairs up against Overwatch's time to play pretty well and beats out hard Moba's for sure.The player population has only gone up since it launched, starting at 5k concurrent players on launch day and is almost at 10k concurrent players- considering how niche of a game this is thats awesome as matchmaking is actually pretty solid now that they've made sure that players in placement games aren't getting put into high rated matches. Finding a match is pretty quick- I usually get into a game within ~15 seconds and haven't waited more than 2 minutes yet.For those who have played BLC and are curious about the changes, here they are.1) Battlerites- instead of the medallion system to customize your character we have a non-grind based system that works more like Heroes of the Storm talents- at the start of each round you pick one out of three perks to add to your character- some characters have more ""clearly best/worst"" options, but for some it works very well, for example I love Bakko (Vanguard) round 1 choices are a) next auto attack deals double damage after using his leap, b) bulwark can be cancelled early to melee an opponent and apply a weaken (-50% damage/healing output) on them, or c) his short dash now Incapitates a target if they get knocked into a wall. All 3 are pretty solid options although I usually lean toward the third.2) Characters are actually talkitive- this was something I always brought up as a downside to Bloodline Champions- the characters didn't have much character outside of their appearance, in this day and age characters need to be talkative to appeal to more casual players, and hell, even as a guy who likes playing games very seriously/competitively I notice that a game that isn't very talkative doesn't seem to have the same grab on me. The voice lines are pretty limited, but its still far better than BLC was.3) Changes to general kit layout- tanks are no longer an archtype, you definitely have more beefy characters in the archtype, but tanks are no longer a full on archtype, the old tanks have been retooled to be supportive damage dealers (more emphasis on damage dealer) than in BLC. For example Rook (Glutton in BLC) lost his rock shield, eat (its now an exe ability) and his dust cloud. He instead gained a trance move that procs his attack speed buff. Also worth noting is that characters have a third ex only ability now- they changed the R button to be a move that is only useable with Ex energy (25% usually) For example Shifu's(Spearmaster) Incapitate swipe is an ex ability- although a third round perk causes it to refund its cost.What this change overall means is that its easier for new players to hop in as there's one less regular ability to keep track of its cooldown, without really removing skill cap as it means experienced players now have more options on how to use their ex energy.4) Smaller MapsThis is a big one, the maps are smaller and this helps out tremendously with keeping the game feeling fast paced. They're not ""tiny"" but the scale is definitely a bit smaller (I'd say ~20%) and there is no Bridges map, thank god.Also, for those wondering what characters are currently in, 13 of the 15 characters in game are ""ports"" of the original 16 characters in bloodlines minus Harbinger, Herald of Insight, and Thorns. I use Port lightly as they've been tweaked to fit the new battlerite system, removal of tank archtype, and addition of an ex only move. The two ""new"" characters are Pearl and Oldur, who are both supports- I don't think Herald will be coming back as Oldur is a heavily reworked Herald- but if you watched the trailer you probably noticed Seeker/Harbinger are in a mostly complete state and will probably be added soon enough.Either way, this got a bit disorganized/ranty but I would highly recommend the game, Definitely more approachable than Bloodline champions and I feel it has much more longetivity. Stunlock Studios has definitely learned from Bloodline Champions and has made a superior product."

Feels like you are punished for not queing with a friend or someone of your own skill level. Currently the matchmaking is terrible and you can be grade 11+ and still get a partner who does not even understand the basic fundamentals of the game....This is not fun for anyone, not the team dominating or the the team getting walked. currently the aggressive elo style either needs to settled or reworked. A player in placement should not be placed with all grade 11+ this will 9 out of 10 times not end well. Of course if you always que with a friend then you can completely disregard my review.Friends of mine have told me they will stop playing for a few weeks and maybe it will stabilize. When your partner finishes the match with less than 100 points total...this is just not fun. rank feels pointless when I am losing rating thanks to a partner that doesnt understand how to play and falls over immediatly. I am all for the true skill rating system and understand new players need to be coddled but good players need to be somewhat isolated from playing people that are potentially way below their level.I did not even mention Ragequitters and team mates that are just plain toxic.... i.e standing in spawn for the lose....something needs to be done. I wanted this game to take off just as much as anyone else but currently I cannot play more than 2-3 games unless I am queing with a friend as I just get extremely frustrated"

Everytime I die I know what happened, why it was fault, and how I can outplay that champ/combo in the future."
,Recommended,504370,34842279,Posted: 9 September,all,daVid // PSN: Waveshaper__,"What are you looknig for?Sick of MOBAs? Sick of being locked together with unreliable teammates who are stubborn, clearly not experienced but still refusing to listen and causing you problems on top of problems? Sick of all of it when after a day of work you get home to get just 3 of these in a row in 3 matches, each lasting at least 15-20 minutes or even up to an hour depending on which game you play? You don't want to feel like you are a burden to your team because you don't have hundreds of hours in the game yet to know what to do / not to do, when, what items to get etc.?This game is inventented FOR YOU then.Despite it's looks on the videos: this is not a MOBA. The control scheme is a far more action oriented twin-stick shooter with WASD/QE/SPACE + Mouse. The whole match is one instant, giant teamfight in a 2v2 or 3v3, latter being obviously the more balanced and competitive mode. A round lasts about 2 minutes tops, first to 3 rounds won wins the match, making Battlerite an excellent game if you want to enjoy the team based action RPG elements of a MOBA, just in a far more action packed version.Playerbase, Free to Play, Early AcccessOne important thing to consider when you buy into a game like this on the current market is the playerbase. A multiplayer game can be great, but if you don't find people to play with it's worthless (see the sad case of Warhammer End Times: Vermintide). It is important to know that game is going to befree to play on launchafter Early Access, with a similar champion unlocking system League of Legends has. Being an Early Access backer grants you all the characters now and in the future for free, and a permanent exp bonus you'll share with your random teammates. Even the EA version consistently finds players real fast, so I wouldn't worry about the downtime after launch.CustomizationIt's a 1:1 copy of Overwatch with skins, weapons, victory poses and with the addition of mounts that you ride for approx. 3 seconds from the starting ring to the battle arena when a round starts. There are lootboxes, there are microtransactions for lootboxes, and 3 different currencies: one to buy champions, one to buy skins, victory poses and mounts, and one to buy the mentioned boxes that include everything above, there are no micropay only items.How does it feel?It's really good. All the animations, the controls, the pacing of the match, the clarity of knowing what's happening and who's doing what is extremely well polished, easy and fast to learn. The characters are well designed and have disctinct abilities both visually and mechanically: a one hit parry shield of a meele hero can do a lot different things on different heroes: it may trigger a berserk mode, store you a self healing charge, mirror back a projectile or allow you to dash away and heal your allies in the process. Currently there are 21 heroes with a few more expected to come for release, and while this number may seem low if you come from traditional MOBAs with their large maps and minions, itemization and whatever, this number is already very high for a simple arena game with each and every one of them earning their spot with their uniqueness, so less is more here, definitely.Is it worth the price?I have to say, no. 20 euros for this game is way too high. 15? Ehh, maybe? But around 10-12 as it has been on various sales several times, it's a fantastic deal. If you want to wait for free to play - be my guest, but that 10 bucks is worth the unlock of all content and future content."

The OG game that did this was Mario 64.This game is what I like to call, ""the melee of mobas"".You have total control over your character. You move with WASD, you turn aim with your mouse. Everything is manual aiming (no click on target and auto hit). This game at its highest level is a pure demonstration of individual skill, reading your opponent, reacting to your opponnent, and teammwork (2v2 and 3v3).You'll get stomped, you'll almost get a sick 2v1 comeback and make a stupid mistake costing your team the game, and yet it still feels good.Its arena goodness without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of gear.

,Recommended,504370,31697546,Posted: 12 May,all,Colo,"Very exciting team-based gameplay. Major emphasis on action/reaction. It's a good brawler, with lots of outplay potential, a very high skill ceiling, and a moderate skill floor. I have a lot of fun with it. There are a multitude of playstyles that are enhanced through Battlerites, and the development team have been actively balancing and rebalancing as required. There are ranked and unranked modes, and the developers have been toying with secondary game modes, such as the Easter event of Bakko's Egg Brawl.Battlerites are modifications to your abilities, three choices presented per round; these can be as simple as making an ability do a little more damage, or adding a new mechanic to one of your existing skills, or introducing a debuff to another ability. Some Battlerites are a bit underwhelming on their respective tiers, but are overall well balanced to allow the player to make dynamic choices on a round-by-round basis. Sometimes you need control, sometimes you need utility, and sometimes you can do it with a bit more damage.As the game is in Early Access, the balance sometimes shifts in directions that I don't personally agree with, but overall, it's a fun, competitive game. You can most certainly play it alone or with friends, and I enjoy playing it fairly casually (in the Casual queue).It is a MOBA in the truest sense; Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. It's not a Dotalike."

The characters have similar skills in terms of having an escape and an ability to knock enemies away, but everything else from basic attacks to ults are unique to the character. There's no latency issues (as someone playing from Australia that's a big deal) to finding matches extremely quick.A review wouldn't be complete without some criticism. There's a problem with people to communicate, I'm not sure if this is due to people generally not wanting to or the chat is too cluttered. This is a game with very high teamwork required, if there's not voice chat which would help tremendously then the chat needs to be clear and active, also some extre time between rounds to give each team time to strategize. Also a system to help allies quickly and effectively communicate during combat and if they die is sorely needed, a ping system like League of Legends would work fantastic, you could ping to tell an ally to heal up, to back off or to engage, teamwork is essential in an arena game and typing out ""Group up"" isn't always viable.Being in early access the gripes are easily fixed before release and considering how much fun it is now to play I'd say the team over at Stunlock are making something special."

Most games are one-sided due to a broken rating system and a queue that prioritizes speed over balance.Examples include:Everyone in a game has 250+ games played but for one person, who has 40.  His rating is roughly equivalent but his inexperience is immediately obvious.   His team lost 0-3.Everyone in a game has ~3000 rating but for one person, who has ~2000.  His team lost 0-3.Win or lose, these games are not fun.Queues are fast - no more than 30 seconds - so there's no excuse of lack of players.Apparently there is a fix in the works - I'll change this review when things are improved.

,Not Recommended,504370,30075484,Posted: 21 February,all,Chief,"Battlerite - Early Access ReviewIf you are currently interested in buying the game, here are some useful points about the game that may convince you (or not) to buy it. I personallywouldn'tbuy it again, mainly because of the balance and matchmaking issues, but that's me. This review was written on February 21st and everything written below is subject to change, due to the game being in Early Access.PRICE:If you buy the game now for 20€, you will get all heroes upon release. After the game is out, you'll probably have to spend more money to get them all or grind. Just for comparison, though: ARK: Survival Evolved costs about the same, so keep that in mind when you're paying for a MOBA that is actually quite shallow.You can also upgrade the 20€ game and get some cool cosmetics if you're into that. 30€ with no game copy, but I guess people still buy it for some reason. I don't think this will be available post-release. Not my cup of tea, but yeah, just so you know.GAMEPLAY, BALANCE, MATCHMAKINGThis is not a skill-based game, no matter how much people are going to try to convince you that it is. It has skill shots, but at the moment there are several issues that don't really make it based entirely on skill.Matchmaking is still in a pretty bad state, especially in 3v3 League. One example: If you play as either Ruh Kaan, Freya, Rook or Bakko (that is, if you are playing as a bit tougher melee hero), the game will far too often queue you with two damage dealers, when the enemy team will have a proper team (with a support). Still winnable, but in the current meta, supports have advantage. Thing is, the matchmaking - when there are not many people playing - starts considering you as a quasi-support, because you may have some shields or disables. Not good.In casual matchmaking you will still get queued will people in League, meaning that you're either getting stomped, especially if you're simply trying out a new champ. This may be frustrating for both ways. I personally never enjoy playing vs people who play casual, because you're literally ruining their experience by tryharding to get the rank, while all they're trying to do is relax and maybe grab a win or two versus people with the same mentality as them.Heroes are imbalanced and meta cannot be countered in any way. There areno bans, youdon't see what opponents pick so that you can react- you pick you hero and you are matched with players. Lower ranks will be fine, but on top you can be sure that more and more people will start following the meta and there's nothing you can do about it. If you will want to have fun and play with a certain hero that is not really strong, you are basically screwed. Sure, you may prove to be a better player than the guy who is playing some imbalanced trash, but he will still have advantage over you. Not saying you can't win against them, but their strength may eventually start to make you think about sacrificing fun for league progress. Also, ranged heroes rule the world.Premade league (that is, playing with teams) is in a poor state because of that. Upon reaching late plat, early diamond, people only play certain compositions in order to win. It is not a question of skill, it is a question of which heroes you pick. Want to counter them? Just play the same comp and beat them at their own game. Deep, isn't it?Competitive scene is very poor at the moment - Stunlock is trying, but meta is meta. All teams pretty much play the same in terms of how they approach the game. It's all about Varesh/Poloma/X, Croak/Jade/Lucie, Croak/Ashka/X and from time to time you may encounter Freya, Rook or Taya. There are some top players who play for fun and stick away from this, but they're a minority.3v3 was made a ""main mode"" because 30 """"""""""top players"""""""""" wrote some quasi-arguments about how much better it is - well, IT IS, imo. But do remember Stunlock listened to them because of their status, as it might happen again and you might not like it. These are largely the same people who abuse the current meta. And yes, I say abused, because that's exactly what it is if this is a skill-based game.Gameplay is really not unique and actually gets stale rather quickly. If you are a casual player, you might get bored with it rather quickly.Several heroes have very similar skills that do very similar things. At the same time, you may find it to be awesome, because there are matches where your heart will be beating like hell and the satisfaction you'll get for some of the plays may just be epic. Depends on what kind of combat you enjoy, though.Tutorial for beginners is horrible. It is one of the worst tutorials I've ever seen.Playing vs AI (also something where you may be able to test heroes and learn) mode is very bad as well. They will never challenge you in any way, and you will learn nothing.EVERYTHING ELSE (Maps, Heroes, Music, Cosmetics, Devs)Cosmetic items are bad and generic, but there's plenty. So cosmetic progression is there, but it's not a very quality progression. Again, if that is your cup of tea.Hero design is pretty generic. Nothing much to say here. A guy that looks like Death and carries a scythe, a black dude from the ""east"" that calls upon the power of the Sun, a warrior with an axe and shield, a blood-thirsty berserker, an Aussie with a boomerang, an Asian with an over-the-top sword and the typical anime haircut, a tiny evil ""thing"" that enjoys murdering stuff, a tiny kid that knows magic, a tiny person that has an obsession with fire, a sniper, a guy that goes invis, a dwarf(-looking) technician with a gun. We've seen it all before.The characters, character-wise, are not ""good"". They're stale, one-dimensional, have no history and lore. There is little-to-no story behind any of them, but for some reason, all of them originate from either South, West, East and North. Relating to them yet?Map design is generic and not really good if I'm honest. Little to no strategic gameplay. You get some from walls to run around, but not much, and getting the mid ball is all about burst, so nothing much there, really.The game has no soul apart from sometimes satisfactory gameplay. Connecting that with the points I made about heroes, there is no atmosphere. You are fighting in the arena, yet there is nothing happening. No announcer, no crowds, no cheers, no boos, nothing. Atleast there are voice actors for the heroes.Music is plain bad. It doesn't fit the high-octane action this game often delivers. It's some calm crap that makes you sleepy. Listen to Conan the Barbarian Main Theme if you'd like to see what kind of music would better suit this game:ClickMarketing and marketing decisions are poor and simply lacking, but as the same time it is wise to save the marketing money for release.The game is still in early access and has a long way to go in order to be come a good game. That being said, it is easily one of the most polished early access games currently available on Steam. Most of that is because it is so simple, but that doesn't change anything.Developers have relatively poor communication with the community, but have recently tried to improve it (and they have)Monetization is very fair at the moment, but expect it to get (a bit?/a lot?) more intrusive as the game becomes free-to-play.You can't communicate with the community while in game. Reddit is pretty much the global chat.My opinion on whether you should buy the game or not: compared to the♥♥♥♥♥♥we're facing nowadays and judging from the fact that Battlerite is still in EA, you may as well buy it. Devs' heart is on the right place, I guess. They try, but they're a long way from making a great product. Gameplay, at the moment, is fine, but that's without the frustrating imbalance and poor matchmaking."

I really wish I could but it is the most infuriating experience I've had in quite some time. Clunky controls and odd character design choices completely ruin the game for me, which is a real shame.The game is supposed to be fast paced with precise timing but the delay on certain abilities mixed with clunky controls and stupid amounts of CC on some characters completely ruin the flow of the game. This game is about outplaying people and having 2s stuns and CC chains that with just 2 people can go over 5s is outrageous.The fact that the F2P release was delayed until the end of 2017 really isn't doing the game any favors as the player count is dropping. The game IS fun, had it worked the way it should. Perhaps it'd be more fun if you had friends to play with but as the F2P is delayed by essentially a year I don't see that happening any time soon.Absolutely not a terrible game, just really disappointing."

It is a very fast paced game that requieres a lot of skill and very good timing, which can be hard to get used to.3.

You'll love having a competent, non-berating teammate.  You'll be bored because your enemies just weren't good enough for you.  You'll question hitboxes.If you lose you'll blame the flavor of the month champion.  You'll hate having an incompetent, berating teammate.  You'll be bored and frustrated wondering why you aren't playing something fun.The gameplay is not fun.  If the fun you can have with a game is determined by those two statements above (and it is) you cannot have fun.  Its simply not possible.  Sure you might get a rush out of killing your opponent out of a tough 1v1.  More often than not you're wondering why X skill's hitbox is so big or how Y skill has zero windup to react to it.Characters play different only insofar that their pacing is different.  Ashka for example is slow but hard hitting with ranged attacks.  Ezmo is quick but soft hitting with ranged attacks.  There's very little differentiation between the characters compared to Bloodline Champions.  Try to think of some defining feature of each character and you really can't.  Sure you can point to a skill that nobody has (like Ezmo's straight line heal) but it exists in other paced forms.  Ashka can heal as well but again more slowly and bursty.There's no satisfactory variety.  There's no fun that isn't determined by everything you can't influence.  The gameplay itself is not actually fun regardless of that.  You move and shoot out similar abilities against humans who do similar things ad nausem.  Its the same tedium as all other MOBAs with the fat trimmed out but the meat is rotten because MOBAs inherently are not fun.That's why these games have grinding systems in place.  Skinner boxes are ""fun"" for humans.  But would they really be necessary if the game itself was fun.  Probably not."

Simply a shameless and absurd practice by the devs.======================================================================I really wish I could give a neutral Review score , but since I can't , I'll go with negative until the game is improved.It's a really fun game , it really takes the pressure If you been playing MOBA like me for years , it may look like MOBA , but it's just really a Deathmatch game between heroes , simple as that.The game is a really good though , pure skill based , you fight in matches 2x2 or 3x3 , the matches fast paced and it won't take too much of your time , yet it make your heart pump fast.The controls are really good and the graphics are nice as well.The community is not very toxic , YET , but you always find people taking gaming too serious...But we have to remember it's a Early Access game, and that is where the problem lies , I normally don't buy EA games , but I was in need of a good game after abandoning League of Legends after playing it for years.Battlerite fit the ""empty space"" , but with some flaws...First , there aren't enough Heroes to keep you interested for countless hours. ( yet , hopefully )After spending more than 120 hours I got to say I'm a bit tired of the same heroes.Second and the biggest failure in my opinion is the matchmaking.Matchmaking it's buggy and unbalanced at the moment.Ranking is divided by Grades , being Grade 15 the top , where only the best players are at.The ranked battles ( where most people are ) function as the same as any ranked game  , you win a match you get points ,you lost a match you lose points , and if you get enough points you climb a Grade.Currently I'm at Grade 12 and it's getting really impossible to climb right now , because for some reason IF there isn't enough players of your grade online the system put you against or with players of grades below / above , but here is the catch:IF you get into a match against players of LOWER grade , even if you win , you end up losing points. ( like it's my fault)So the game end up punishing you because the lack of players / bad matchmaking system.IF you get into a match against players of grades ABOVE yours and you lose ( because obviously they are better than you , so odds are against you ) you also lose points.So in essence , you got to hope that the matchmaking put you with teammates of the SAME grade against people of the SAME grade , or you're done.And third , the report system is a joke.It doesn't happen often , but I've already seem people being racist , people raging and insulting and rage quit as well.I've reported people like that , sometimes the same toxic person , and nothing is done.I believe the punishment should be faster and more severe , so the game community does not turn into another LoL , but I guess the devs are really not worried since the money is coming.As for now I'll stop playing the game for a while until some updates are done , probably going to move on to another game.The value is not bad  , since I've more than 120 hours I believe my money was worth it , and taking into account that if one day I return all heroes will be unlocked. ( ASSUMING the game does not die )But I would recommend waiting for a sale discount to get this one."
,Not Recommended,504370,28258682,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,LunatikLucy,"First off, I love this game. It's a blast to play, the characters are fairly balanced, and the matches are short enough to where I can fit them into my busy schedule. So why don't I recommend it?Online is fairly dead in the NA servers. It takes me about 5 minutes to find a match in Standard. I don't even bother with Ranked any more, because it can take up to fifteen minutes to find a match during peak hours. This wouldn't be too bad if the matches lasted longer, but when games are over in 10 minutes, it's kind of pointless. My rank's not even that good, and I've heard the wait times worsen the better your ELO is.Now, normally I wouldn't blame the developers, but the servers will get an influx of people once it goes F2P. For some reason, the devs are delaying officially releasing Battlerite as F2P until the end of 2017. This game's not going to survive until then. I can't understand their reasoning behind this. For a game marked as Early Access, Battlerite is quite complete. Tweaks are needed here and there, but literally every PVP game these days has patches. I'm not a developer, so I may be missing something, but the game's going to die unless it goes F2P."

However after hours of playing the game many of the flaws started to show themselves and became more and more apparent.BUY IT OR NOT:Don't buy it, get it for free when it becomes free-to-play early/mid Q1 2017Pros:-No RNG on the damage, everything has a set damage values so you won't randomly get killed by a lucky crit.-Just about everything is a skillshot (no clicking on an enemy and having your character auto-attack, you need to aim everything)-Lots of characters to choose from, and some still being added.-Balance between the characters feels good for the most part.-No talent trees or ""gemming""-Matches don't last very long, so if you end up with an inexperienced team mate, you don't need to wait long before a new game.-Community is slightly better than other MOBA's (I don't think it will last)-Developers seem to still be vested in the development of the game, however I don't think many of them play their own game very often.Cons:-Matches don't last very long, not much excitement from winning a 5-10 minute game.-The report player system is a complete joke, purely placebo at the moment-Many character abilities seem to not work as intended, such as invincibility not blocking silence/root. Being feared into the circle of death does not break fear. (incapacitate/petrify is broken by it)-Community is relatively small, you could queue against a team, wait 4-6 minutes so you don't fight the same people, and still get queued into the same team.-Community feels as if it's getting more and more toxic.-While individual characters feel balanced against each other, some team compositions certainly don't feel balanced.-Double healer in 2v2 queue is viable against any other team comp, and in some cases overpowered.-Ranked play is currently not worth the grind. You get 0-15 points for beating a team, most often you gain 1-7 points. Ranking up takes 500 points, I believe the max rank is 15 or 20.-No ranked tokens to spend on cool ranked skins/titles/weapons."

I had fun playing the tutorial and against AI, thought I made the right purchase. As soon as I start playing PvP, the nightmare started. I have expected a steep learning curve but losing 20 games in streak without even winning a single round is not fun at all. I was queuing with my friend and we were both new to the game and in the bronze league, there are only about 2 or 3 teams constantly being matched as our opponents, which all have players in the platium leageue who are weigh above our skill group.Then my friend and I decide to solo queue, thinking it might help the matchmaking mechanism with a small player base (and the fact that we are in Australia makes it worse). Then we met another two players who also solo queued. One of the player is a twitch streamer with 600+ hrs experience of that champion and another player also played 160+ hrs. Guess how the matchmaking team up players? Yes, my friend and I who both only played 5 hours are put in one team against the other two. Can the matchmaking of this game be more hilarious? For a game of 600hrs+5hrs players vs 160hrs+5hrs players, it is not balance but you can use the excuse of player base is too small. For a game of 600hrs+160hrs players vs 5hrs+5hrs players, you got to love the matchmaking algorithm.If you buy this game, be prepared that you will be the only new player in this game for a very long long time, and everyone else will just steamroll you for your first a hundred games if you are in a remote location like Australia and want to play alongside with your friend."

The latter had an open beta in 2010 and was officially released in January of 2011. However, this was around the same time League of Legends' popularity skyrocketed. Lol's burgeoning popularity meant that Bloodline Champions was quietly swept under the rug and never heard from again.Years later, Battlerite is attempting to rekindle the good elements its predecessor had, but its future seems tenuous at best.Let's start off with the gameplay. It has a top-down, eagle-eye perspective like most MOBAs. Characters have Q, W, F, R hotkey abilities, like almost every other MOBA.Games are comprised of 2v2 and 3v3 matches. You kill the other team and get a point. After each round, you get to choose one of three ""Battlerites"" that will buff a certain ability. First team to 3 points wins.That's it. That's literally it. As of the day I type this, those are the only two game types. In Bloodline Champions, there was a deathmatch mode, a capture the flag mode, and a conquest mode where you capture certain parts of the map to win.Combat is swing and miss. You control your character with the W, A, S and D keys, and you aim with your mouse. Left mouse is your primary attack ability, and right mouse is a channeled attack. As previously mentioned, Q, E, R and F serve as your characters other abilities.Balance seems to be the biggest challenge. One patch, a character will be considered the highest tier character in the game, and the next patch they'll be nerfed into near uselessness. Some characters like Poloma and Croak are almost always used while others like Bakko and Rook are seldom seen.The game seems to have a particularly high learning curve. It's not helped by the fact that Battlerite is already hosting a notoriously toxic playerbase. It makes Dota 2 look like a tea party. (And yeah, I'm aware that every multiplayer game has angry, obnoxious manchildren. Yeah, I'm aware that you need thick skin on the Internet to endure whatever crap comes your way.) The game allows you the option to turn off chat features, but communication seems woefully vital for a game like Battlerite.Finally, you can unlock cosmetic appearances, weapons, profile pictures, mounts and victory poses; it's almost exactly like Overwatch's method. You can buy chests with gold you receive via leveling and daily quests. Alternatively, you can use real money to buy tokens which, in my opinion, cost far too much.In conclusion, I can't say that I ""hate"" the game. I think the Battlerite team is doing well for what they've made so far. But unless they want to see the fate of Bloodline Champions a second time, I think they seriously need to start looking into ways to make the game more robust. A game with nothing but 2's and 3's matches will lose its novelty quickly."

The game had an amazing amount of hype, and a great community following off the bat. However, after a year of having a soon to be F2P game cost $20 it just hasn't been able to pick up the traffic and community it needs. They hardly ever come out with a new character, and seem to put their priorities into the wrong area. They should focus on getting the game complete, and pushing out the F2P version it needs, and then focus on character reworks, etc.If you're looking into getting the game because it looks cool by all means do so, it's a great game. However, keep in mind you probably won't see too many changes, updates, characters, etc. come out. It's pretty stale when it comes to new content like that."

Sucks to be a support.Sadly, it would be really easy to fix too if they would just put your ranking on a per champion basis. Then, you know you wouldn't be playing with a plat who decided to try ashka for the first time and do it in ranked instead of casual. I enjoyed the game at first because the matchups on a whole felt better, but now it's just super frustrating and not worth the price, hardly worth being free.(On a side note, per champion rating would fix a lot of competitive games in all likelyhood.

The developers of this game do not care about anyone other than the top playerbase. I.e. Grand Champion's and maybe Champions. I have climbed to Champion rank because of in depth knowledge of BLC and its likeness to this game having been the critically aclaimed predecessor to BLC but I can tell you it is not fun. Currently there are around 1-2k max players at peak times across all regions. There are 16 champions to choose from and that is fine all with their unique abilities but the problem lies in the foundation of all mobas in my opinion which makes this game unplayable.1. Matchmaking - you will find yourself as a Champion 8 player going against 2 Diamonds and land yourself a nice average at best plat player or gold or silver, good luck climbing. THEN, you can get put without a support and as anyone with a brain can tell you , when someone has heals vs a team without it makes it totally improbable from the get go that you will win, this is very very common to see. THEN you can get double melee vs double ranged.. OR WORSE Double counter vs team without counters. The game is just trash in terms of mm and it is absolutely pointless to try and climb because MM will throw you back down the ladder as fast as possible getting new player team mates.2. NO PICKS OR BANS... well you may have seen this one coming, the secondary reason i stated above which ruins mm. THe developers could integrate a simple picks and bans phase and the game would be playable again.. NOPE THEY RATHER ADD A NEW CHAMP.3. Raigon, unblockable stun, granted you can run away but why should you have to waste a cd for that - terrible idea to give him that as a battlerite.4. AFK's - 0 punishment you can just afk and be fine when game ends.5. NO TOURNAMENT SYSTEM - yep you guessed it, no tournament system, instead you have to go to a ropey website that offers pros only a chance to win mounts and cash with no chance for any upcoming teams to win. Doesnt even sort by grade, you can join yes but you face 3 Grand Champions who are PROFFESSIONALS . Absolute joke.6.Battlerite lite keys before god damn free to play increased only smurf numbers, congrats you destroy any actual new players climbing, yes devs you are dumb.7.Varesh m1>m2ex>m1 absolutely ridiculous , needs nerfed .Dont buy this game, wait for free to play and wait for ALL of the above to be fixed , if it hasnt been continue with another moba because it is in a trash state with a really really low player count you will be waiting 30 mins on a queue only for all of the above♥♥♥♥♥♥to happen."

It used to be good a year ago when it came out but now ever since the biggest patch (the M1 changes) it's a wacky clusterfuk.Game used to be harder, a bit slower but ballanced it was good and fit the style. Now they buffed ranged dmg, movement speed(where you can literally stack 2 speed buffs and end up in the other corner of the map in just 2 seconds, just anoying), made hit and run a thing, lower the skill cap of the game by alot.Incredible poor and awfull game management!-Bad ballancing of the little pool of heroes they have! Ranged champions having the advantage.-Bad ranked  system. You can basically play with bronze players untill the very end till diamond tier (the decent players start around Diamond 3); Why em I saying this?? Because of the lack of players base and of their bad or lazy methods of promoting and fueling the game with more players, they introduced a bonus wining streak (4), and besides that you don't get punished anymore for sucking or losing until diamond. When back in they days when I was plat 1 and struggle-ing to get into diamond, I used to have to win 2-3 times to back up a loss.Now, it's the other way around.-They release content or a champion once in every 3 months or so. Instead every month they pretent to ballance things but end up being worse!-I had no problems with this game, until the m1 changes. But now, I'm starting to regret the time and effort i've put into this game.And there is alot more but I don't want to put time into this game anymore in any way right now. I hope they would smack some sense into them and on release they would make things right. Otherwise, it's Bloodlinechampions ( the predecesor of battlerite) all over again. RIP BLC"

But it shouldnt be neccessary to turn the chat off, just to be able to enjoy a game with only 2v2 or 3v3.Overall, im very disappointed by how elitist the players are turning this game, and i admit, this affects my review negatively."

Most of these problems correlate with the game being too fast paced. But I also find that there is a certain lack of heroes as well, a lot of them seeming to be very similar mechanically. Too many characters who can jump, heal and damage with a basic attack/ability, and having the ability to silence/stun/root. Itreallydidn't feel like any champions specialize in one particular thing, weaknesses or counters. Which I find boring and evident of lacking ideas. I also dislike how you can only level up your abilities in this much similar to Heroes of the Storm. Not because ""OMG YOU'RE RIPPING OFF HOTS"" but because it's ♥♥♥♥ing boring in the first place, because it limits the amount of good builds available in this game, taking awayeven morestrategy and complexity. Even though this eliminates the idea of farming altogether (which is a bit boring) I don't think a MOBA can survive without it. I mean you need to farm in Heroes of the Storm as well! Awarding players for losing in the last round is stupid, even though it makes the game slightly unfair to take that away now (for it being a core aspect of the gameAnd honestly I don't think you can fairly count this as a MOBA. Mostly because it lacks in almost every aspect of being, well... a MOBA. Almost zero diversity, no punishing players for losing in duels, no farming, no chance to try and grab the competitive edge, except the (smash) ball in the middle, and there's almost no diversity among the whole cast.However, there are some little good aspects about this game. Mostly because this game is at least trying to be different. I mean they're almost trying to reinvent the whole genre, and I will respect them for doing that. But it just doesn't feel like they're doing it correctly.Also not worth $20 bucks while in Early Access. (Or $15 when on winter sale). Not enough content.I think I have probably played too little to completely judge this game, but my friends who've played it in the past tend to agree that these past points are true.However, there are still glimmers of hope left for it is only in early access."

I recently quit league of legends because i thought the company attitude towards the people who played it sucked but this game has convinced me one thing.... league wasn't so bad after all, at least in league you have a period of 1 vs 1 and chance of outplay in this game if you are matched with someone with slow reactions or the slightest bit of hesistation you lose.

,Not Recommended,504370,28293797,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,"Pete, King of the Detectives","Battlerite falls into the same trap as many of its class-based brethren, where an initial period of excitement soon gives way to disappointment after the shiny new paint begins to peel away. The fundamental problem here is in the game's treatment of its support classes. The mere existence of a class that can heal other characters has serious implications for game balance: if the character is even somewhat viable they become a requirement for any team to succeed. Anyone who's played League will tell you about the problems that Soraka has caused, and in class-based shooters such as TF2 and Overwatch if someone doesn't man up and take on healing duty you can kiss your chances of winning goodbye. Often the problem is that these characters aren't very fun to play due to a lack of things to do other than healing, but Battlerite has the opposite problem: the healing characters are simply able to do everything. 90% of the time the person with the highest score is going to be the team's support, not only because of their healing but also because they were able to do comparable damage to the dps characters, and maybe put out the most disables too. There's simply no drawback; you don't sacrifice anything by picking a support class since they can all easily 1v1 any of the other characters in the game. It's like if the Medic had the athleticism of the Scout and the Soldier's rocket launcher, but could also airblast people just because. To give an example, here's Lucie, who has:- a middling autoattack (12 damage when the low is around 8 or 10 and the high I believe is 16)- possibly the best heal in the game (instant heal + heal over time + potential damage boost)- a massive shield (roughly 1/4th to 1/5th of a character's max health)- a knockback that also removes buffs and debuffs (and can heal)- a 3s panic (which makes you run in the opposite direction until you take a certain amount of damage AND doubles as a petrify which is similar)- a delayed poison that does two autos worth of damage- a combat roll in case she ever gets into any sort of dangerMany of the non-support characters are able to fill small niches that the supports cannot, but it never feels like you need, say, a ranged character and a tank character along with your support to win.Perhaps in a game where matches are so short including these healing classes was a mistake. I can tell you that the most fun I've had is when neither team has had a support and we can just go full retard at each other without getting constantly panicked and turned to stone. Battlerite certainly has its fair share of other balance issues, but this is the one that seems like the most off-putting to me. Obviously I got my money's worth, but I don't know how long this game is going to last if such a fundamental and obvious problem exists.(As a sidenote, Battlerite probably has the worst matchmaking in any game that I've seen; maybe it's just due to the small playerbase? It's pretty common to get rematched against the same team 2-4 times in a row, and if either team is clearly better than the other then it just isn't fun. Hopefully this gets changed somehow with the next patch, which is supposed to overhaul the entire matchmaking system.)Taster's score: C-"

Well made characters, voice acting, sound effects and the combat has great feedback, no floaty nonsense. Yet, I just can't seem to enjoy playing it.This is a general issue I find in many MOBA games, and that is that there's always the feeling that I lost because there was nothing I could have done, not because I was worse than my opponent. This mostly comes from the arbitrary cooldowns each ability has, making you basically useless for a few seconds after using them. Technically speaking, that does make me worse, but I don't find it enjoyable enough to start learning the game and become better.While this is not an actual MOBA (no creep, no bases, just team vs team), they use a similar combat setup in a twin-stick environment. Therefore, downsides that come along with it are present.If you are in to top-down multiplayer arena games you will probably enjoy this, it's a solid work. However, if like me you already dislike the usual MOBA combat then you probably won't find enjoyment here either."

It's uninspired and boring and leads to very little variety.The dialogue is *very* cringe-y and tough to listen to. They weren't going for creative points in this category either. Then you get these cringe-y heroes that keep repeating the same terrible lines and you just want to unplug your speakers.This doesn't bug everyone, but I didn't like how they copied so many of the heroes from League of Legends. It's pretty obvious and they're definitely worse off with the terrible voice acting. In a way, it's like how Paladins totally ripped off Overwatch, at least when it comes to hero design.All of this combined made for a disappointing experience.

I am a former challenger semi-Professional League of Legends player so I have a good amount of experience in moba balancing. I have to say that although this game is very fun, as soon as you run into any kind of players who play to win (they play meta picks only) all fun stops almost immediately. You learn the combos of your character quite quickly and begin to question the classes quite quickly as well for they make no sense. You have the same 2-4 characters that run and dominate most of the game especially in 2v2. I have tried playing against the meta picks and have to say despite the very clear distinction of performance it doesn't matter for they win because they are just meta. If you enjoy playing the same 1-2 champions over and over and over and over then by all means it is a great game for you. On the other side of the coin though if you seek an enriched game that is not so narrow in character gameplay then this game is horrible. I do not reccomend this overall if you actually enjoy quality games. This game is poorly created and has horrible balancing issues. The few champions who are meta do everything better than everyone else and it is quite annoying to be polite. You learn who those characters are quite quickly after playing. Don't waste your time on this if you expect to enjoy a quality game."

You throw a circle that heals your allies. Almost everyone has about the same dps with not enough meaningful mechanical differences. They all have just about the same mobility and same defensive capabilities with superficial differences. A lot of people recognize this, but seem to think it is required to have balance.

And its good while we are talking about 1 v 1 fights.But developer has no any respect to players who come in Battlerite for fair and challenging matches. And they have never responded on feedback about bugs and exploits in matchmaking system. I wrote more than 20 reports overall (not just reports to toxic or bad player or smth. No, I wrote about totally unchallenging matchmaking system and about ways to fix it. As I said, NO ANY respond. Developer inst interested in wide player base, so no respect to players who want to play chellenging matches. They face new players with 2 month + experienced players. And u just randomly get 1 or 2 of such players in every match. If u dont believe me, just try night Q, when it becomes totally crap. I am totally ok if my Q will take 10+ minutes or 20+ minutes - but I gonna play balanced matches. There is no reason to try it 1 v 2 or 2 v 1 every 5 minutes.... there isnt intersting at all.I still have pretty good stat for a casual player about 63% winrate, but I quit play this game, cuz of matchmaking became impossible to handle... Last 20 matches, I played I got about 5-7 plyers who were trolls, who doesnt care about win, about anything on their screen. It was just 2 v 3 or 1 v 3 matches. And they come in a row. I got same guys (I have just already reported) again and again. Other matches was tilted by Grade system. 8+8+10 vs 10+10+10, 9+10+10 vs 8+9+9 and so on... So the result was clear since begining. Yes I won some of the matches, but there wasnt any fun in the end.... It was just rolls of roulete of Matchamaking.Overall. Good game with awesome mechanics and skill-based gameplay, ruined by 'nevercare' developer, troll community and broken matchmaking.I never played BC, but heard much good responds about that game.

This game is so badly balanced that it makes old seasons of leage look like the zenith of balance. They have no idea about what the game should be balanced around 3v3 or 2v2. Games arent even close most of the time. Matchmaking is broken and doesnt put you against appropriately skilled players. Also there are not enough champions in the game. Yes this is pre release and early access and stuff but i expected so much more from this game. Do not buy this game untill they solve the issues unless its like 75% sale or something.

Many champions are pretty bad with limited range.  No items no customization in 2v2.   Most of casual matchmaking feels unbalanced but that is probably due to population.

It has a lot of good Ideas and the other people here have named them all.BUT there is a HUGE problem with this game and that is matchmaking. You pick your Champ before you enter the matchmaking and you have no control over the selcetion process. This means that it is pretty much completely random what allies you get. I for example play Tanks and I pretty much always get supports. But I dont need a support. I want a dps or Brawler. That means that it is very hard for me to win against a lot of enemy combos because we lack damge.And the ranking system is especially at the beging not very good because it is not really based on skill at the start. Everybody starts at the same level and you need a lot of Points to get to the next Stage. This can be very fustrating.Change the Matchmaking and the ranking and I will recomend this game to everybody.

Those people are probably accustomed to this sort of thing. For people who aren't used to having control ripped out of their hands a good portion of the time, it's not a very pleasant experience.Lastly, screw the matchmaking system.

I'm still trying to get used to it because I've never played a top down game like this before. I'm not gonna lie, I suck at this game and I'm not having the best time playing it.I'm noticing that underneath my name it says, ""Placement"" while others say, ""Founder"" and ""Contender."" I'm also noticing that while I'm solo I'm being paired against people who are in groups. You can tell who's in a group by the way they play. We get split up. They stay together.My problem is the fact that I'm a solo/new player playing with randoms getting paired against premades with experience. We're at a disadvantage because we're not communicating as well as they are and we didn't pick our characters to coincide with one another. They almost always have a healer, we don't. Also, why are people who are new and still learning like myself being paired against people with more experience? Once again, we're at a disadvantage because I'm still learning. I can understand if there's not enough people playing to put premades against premades but there should be enough people in the same category to keep ""placement"" people with their own skill level.I also feel the characters are unbalanced. Some characters are far more powerful than others. For instance, while playing the frog guy I noticed that I spend the entire match trying to catch up to the healer with the pet. I feel like this is not how it's supposed to be because the frog's kit is full mobility.When you first start playing you don't notice the toxic community but once you enable chat the toxicity begins. Because I'm new and I'm still learning I get harassed a lot. This is a buzz kill because I'm still trying to get the hang of things. I don't need to be told the obvious like, ""God you're bad."" I already know that. You telling me is just killing my vibe. So if you're a new player keep the chat disabled. Trust me. You'll have more fun.At the end of the day I think this isn't the game for me. I'm not enjoying it. I find it very difficult for me to get used to the camera angle. I don't like any of the characters they have available (I've tried them all). I wouldn't recommend this unless you're used to playing games like Dota 2 or League of Legends and want something more fast pace. I also wouldn't recommend this if you play alone a lot like I do."

You get 50 gold every 3 wins and you can buy a gold chest that have at least one epic and 2 other random items for 500 gold. There are also daily quests (those are the typical win 4 games with support/healer/melee you have seen in other games) that gives you a silver chest that have 3 random items while one of them being a rare or better. If you get a duplicates you get Tokens that allows you to buy any item you want. Also as you can guess you can buy gold chests with real money (2 chests cost 3 euro while if you buy in bulk you can buy 45 chests for 46 euro)Cons:Battlerite system (also known as talents or perks in other games) where you pick a battlerite every round before the game starts. Most of the time one talent is way better than the other 2 such as with Bakko where Adrenaline Rush is better than the other 2 and Mobile Defence being a trash talent compared to Bravery and Battle Lust. I can continue to do that with other heroes but i will stop here. There are one more flaw about this system as well. In BLC the game flows well after a round the game quickly after a 3 sec cooldown starts the next round while in Battlerite it can take 30 seconds (sometimes even more) before everyone picked their battlerites and the 3 second cooldown for the next match startsOnly 15 heroes. I know it is EA and everything and i also know it is harder for SLS to create a hero in this game compared to LoL/Dota but 15 are still very low. BLC in beta had more heroes for what i rememberOnly 2 real gamemodes (2vs2 and 3vs3) no Capture the Artifact or Conquest to be found hereHealers can outheal dps while still having ok damage themself while not having much lower hp than other heroes. They need a nerf on how much they can heal or on their HP so it is easier to focus themBland music. The soundtrack in Battlerite is not bad but it is very mediocre and forgettable. That is sad as the music in Bloodline Champions are great if you dont believe me listen for yourselfhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLzidDxmjdYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_2SfP7xpgIhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPhd362eEcUthat get you pumped up for a fight while the music in BR might as well not be thereNo ingame voice chat. BLC have one HoN have one Dota 2 have one Overwatch have one why dont Battlerite have one? This is one of these games where in game voice chat would be super useful as it is a team based game that needs teamwork (and the fast paced action means that you cant type in the middle of a round like you can with standard mobas/ARTS/AoS games) and from all the Overwatch games i played i did not have one flaming me in voice chat. I hope a ingame voice chat will come soonEnd comment. This game can be fun but they need to add a lot more to the game as i do think it can be a great game if they add more content and balances it a bit.

If you just have a few minutes to play and solo q, you basically lose every game.  Also every game is a ""ranked"" game.  IF you happen to be colorblind, you can forget about keeping track of your crosshairs and hitting skillshots effectively (1 in 12 men are colorblind.) IDC how basic in conception a game is, putting similar colors on similar colors and is pretty stupid considering the numbers.  There's TONS of issues to fix to make this game more forgiving to casual players and those new to the genre.  I'm not a game designer, but this game has a lot of potential, there just needs to be some type of variety in types of champions to play, and solo q people should perhaps only q against other solo q people to help with matchmaking issues as a start.  There really needs to be a pure tank class that just puts out CC but little damage also, that'd be a lot of fun to play, and would set up dps well.  That's my 2 cents.Edit: In the process of asking Steam for a refund on this game, let's hope they come through for me.

The cracks in the game started to show:Pros:- High skill ceiling.- Nice  music.- The game features the ability to create private games where you can fight AI. You can tailor the intelligence level of each character on the team, which is a cool feature.Miscellaneous:- Essentially a MOBA without the tedium / complexity of towers, minions and farming. An arena game similar, yet not as good as ""Forge"".Cons:- Unbalanced characters. Current tier list ( I don't agree with some of the placments but you can get a rough feel for the game here ):https://www.tentonhammer.com/articles/battlerite-tier-listUnbalanced characters eventually made it boring to play the mandated, handful of overpowered characters, in the very limited 15 character roster.- Heavy handed nerfs from the developers. Poloma was an overpowered support character that had her range nerfed, turning her into gank-bait by ranged DPS. I think that she mostly spends her time running from one side of the map to the other now. The obvious balance change would have been to simply reduce her DPS, 1 point at a time, to each skill and see how it played out. That would have been an example of intelligent micro-management.- The match-making system is god awful. You could be paired up with someone who just installed the game 15 minutes ago. 3v3 often devolves into, ""Whichever team has the new player, loses"". The queue times are very fast but at the expense of balanced teams. I'm predicting that between now and the game going Free-to-Play in Q1 2017, the player base will drop even further ( it went from 13,160 to 8,220 within two weeks ):http://steamcharts.com/app/504370#All- The match-making system uses the Trueskill system, so if you are familiar with the game SMITE and the daily complaints and inevitable threadlocks, regarding match-making, you will be familiar with Battlerite:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkillhttp://forums.smitegame.com/forumdisplay.php?167-General-SMITE-DiscussionRealistically, there's no way to analyze a battle and assign a numeral that represents how well someone did, you'd need a next-generation IBM Watson with Deep Learning / Google AlphaGo  supercomputer to do that. One thing that games can stop doing is putting new players with ranked players ( new players should be paired with new players and go from there ). Queue times would be longer but the question is, would you rather wait a few minutes, to get an evenly matched game, or have a fast, yet meaningless landslide in either direction ( which I consider a terrific waste of time ).- The rewards system consists of giving a handful of points for a win but heavily penalizing a loss. Eventually, I noticed that I had spent an entire day losing the minimal gains that I had eeked out. Since every game is a ranked game, you are basically screwed in solo queue and the only way to play the game is with a pre-made. The rewards system gets funny when you are awarded +1 or +0 for a win, especially if you overcame higher ranked oponents. The only way to receive the maximum reward is to win 3-0 and even then, there's no guarentee that you will receive a decent reward. The game fails to recognize miraculous comebacks. In one game we ended up winning 3-2 with me being a grade 8 Croak ( assassin ) and solo killing a Grade 9 Croak and a Grade 10 Sirius ( Healer-DPS ) in a ""last man standing scenario"". My team consisted of Grade 7's, so they got destroyed quickly. My reward: +1 point. It's a slap in the face. It gets even worse though - someone randomly disconnects or AFKs on your team and you receive -20 or -30 points.This is a review for the Early Access version of the game that currently costs $21.99 Canadian dollars. Between now and the game being officially released in Q1 2017, the game will be patched multiple times, have new characters added and become Free-to-Play, at which point this review will become obsolete.Although I don't think that this game is worth $20, there's never any reason not to take a look at a Free-to-Play game. I'm predicting that toxicity in the game will go through the roof when it goes Free-to-Play though..."

,Not Recommended,504370,25697518,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,Boone,"This is the first time in which I've wished I could leave just an ""OK"" review. This game does not deserve an overwhelmingly positive score, but I do not think I'd necassarily say the game isbad. I think it lies just in the middle. The game is and isn't a MOBA. By definition a MOBA is a MULTIPLAYER ONLINE BATTLE ARENA, which sums up what this game is to a tee. However, this game is more of a compilation of DotA, LoL, and HotS with many apsects of thoseFREEgames stripped away.The game very blatantly takes things from the afforementioned games, but reuses those things in a new and unique, easy-to-learn way. But perhaps the things stripped away to make this game was just too much. I feel like I'm playing just another MOBA but it's way too simple. You just go into a circle and cast abilities on each other. There is no real learning curve, no skill builds, no items... It's just learn what your characters do, and go lay the smackdown on some fools.And that's fun the first few times, but gets old really fast, especially since all of the characters are kind of just rebrands of each other. Your left mouse click is an attack. Your right click is a stronger attack that might have some casting time. Your Q is a counter attack. Your space bar is for mobilty or a shield depending on if you're playing a support or core role. Your E is generally the most diverse and unique ability. And that's that. Each of the heroes has that kind of general foundation.One thing I didn't mention though about part of the abilties is the way they handle ultimates, they give you a strong abilty and a stronger ability. Each of the abilities uses up some energy that you gain over time from either hitting things or picking stuff up around the map and you get to make the choice of whether to use your strong ability to get an advantage over the enemy, or wait for your stronger ability and win the fight that way.You might notice that I give this game points for being unique every time they do it, because I think being unique is good, but this game just isn't that unique. Like I said before, this game copies. This game even copies the bad♥♥♥♥♥♥that doesn't need to be in the game, such as loot crates. Hearthstone really started some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and I have had enough of it. It works for a goddamn digital card game, but now the loot crate system is in literally every ♥♥♥♥ing game and it needs to stop. IT'S TIME TO STOP. I don't need having microtransactions in your game be the norm. I don't need that to be the gimmick that keeps a game afloat. I want a game's content to be what keeps it going, not its ♥♥♥♥ing skins and that false sense of luck when you open something LEGENDARY. The♥♥♥♥♥♥is worthless and has no place being in the game. And especially not in this game in which all of the skins look exactly the same except legendaries have an epileptic glow. To me, it really feels like this game has skins just to have skins, which is exactly the thing I knew would happen right when I saw Todd Howard present his new Fallout game for iOS featuring loot crates with the same exact rarity rating from WoW.Somehow this game managed to diversify itself by adding a pricetag, putting itself on a pedastal to look down on MOBA's and say ""I'm not like you."" No, this game is just like those games, but for people looking to get the bare minimum of the MOBA experience. If this game was free, I'd probably be more inclined to give it a positive review, because it would be just another MOBA clone, but with a unique twist just unique enough to be refreshing yet nostalgic. But if this game was free, it likely would not have any recognition. It's like that old wondorous age-old question. Would you rather have Harambe live, but be forgotten, or have him killed only to be the most famous gorilla of all time?"

For other people purchasing this game for the same reason, I would highly suggest trying Heroes of the Sotrm first instead. Yes, it does have minions and towers, but there is no farming, and the game focuses on fast-paced, team-based combat.Battlerite just offers this combat style in a lesser extent. The size of the arena only goes up to 3v3, and the combat can feel quite sluggish, despite what the trailers show.

,Recommended,504370,30405496,Posted: 9 March,all,strato,"Battlerite has been called by many a moba, and while I certainly understand how it could be identified as such, I shall proceed to reject any such notion. For many gamers, the word moba brings to mind league of legends, or dota 2. It creates a vision of one sitting in a lane against an enemy, last hitting creeps, accumulating gold, and in general, a long and monotonous experience. Battlerite, on the other hand, flings players face first into the action. It's like that girl you asked out who tells you she wants to focus on school, in contrast with the girl who tells you no because you're ugly as hell. Battlerite delivers pure, eccentric, and strategic combat. It gets to the damn point with none of that last hitting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for 20 minutes followed by walking around until some idiot gets caught out. Battlerite, at it's essence, is a tavern brawl you find yourself embroiled in minutes after grabbing a drink, whilst moba's are a pointless war you (probably will) end up in because some idiot decided to run for president. With experienced devs, a mostly welcome community, and amazing core gameplay, I simply have nothing but praise for this game."

,Recommended,504370,30111940,Posted: 22 February,all,nEmo,"TLDR: Game is incredibly fast paced and well polished. Has easily become one of my favourite games on the market. Low player base is unsettling however it is still early access and will go F2P in quarter 1 of 2017 so it should pick up shortly. If you have the cash it's worth the buy however at the time of this review F2P isnt far off so it may be worth the wait.This game has it's ups and downs with me but I still find myself having a good time playing it from time to time. My first experience with this game was a little upsetting as I thought the game wasnt balanced very well until I later realized that I was simply trash and that the tutorial skips out on some key aspects of gameplay. If you are a new player venturing into this game I would definitely recommend looking up some guides to further understand how the dynamics of this game work and patch the knowledge gaps the tutorial leaves you with.Personally I recommend using this youtube video I found that is both informative and genuinly enjoyable to watch as well.{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP1Az5kpS98}After learning some of the key elements to the game from outside sources you will notice that this information has allowed you to identify where and when you should be a little bit better. It's also around this time that you begin to realize that there is a fairly large learning curve associated with this game. I myself struggled with this moment and I found that playing with others [Friends, helpful individuals]  who are able to give constructive feedback not only helps improve your game but provides that morale boost to keep on grinding. Eventually you will come to a point where you are no longer enjoying the ease of the ""Casual"" mode and you will move into the competitive scene where the difficulty ratchets and your ego deflates. The matches at this point become incredibly intense and in my mind this is where the heart of the game is. The competitive though a little wonky in its initial placement rankings is so mind bogglingly fun. It has been a good while since I have had a game bring my heart rate to a blazing fast speed but I genuinely feel this when I get down to the end of a match.Though I could likely rant about my personal experience and enjoyment in this game for months I am going to bring it on down to a pro's and con's list.Pro:-Fast Paced Combat-Quick Matches-Decent Hero Selection-Attentive Developers-Visually Appealing-Intense Competitive Format-Interesting Game MechanicsCon:-Uninformative Tutorial-Steep Learning Curve [Not too much of a con here, however some people may see it that way]-Early Access Small Player Base-Pre-Match Hero Selection [Again not too huge of an issue here especially if you are with a group who can build from lobby but this game does not matchmake according to selected roles... It just throws people together]"

The champions are fun to play, queue times are short and games are action-packed and fast. Its true about the skill based combat which I enjoy!All things you can buy with real money are also cosmetic which means no pay to win.Im from Australia so theres an Asia server with 80ping which is real nice.I would reccomend this game!

The gameplay is just fantastic: Fast paced combat without any random factors or items which makes it skillbased and competitive. Before each round you can chose from a battlerite which enhances one of your skillmoves, making you think about the composition you are facing and which battlerite is the best to get. Keep in mind, that EarlyAccess gives you all champions coming out in the future, forever, which is just a great deal in my opinion. I encourage everyone reading this to try it out and if not now, at least when the Game launches. After about 40 hours of playing it seems very stable to me. I hope the playerbase will grow and stay at a comfortable number of players."

You'll also see one dude stomp 2 guys by outplaying them very well and that kind of action. The action is easy to read after a little while and more characters are on their way. I really like that unlike LoL/DotA type of MOBAs you're not stuck for half an hour to over an hour (depending on your game length) as one game tend to be pretty quick (not sure how long my longest games where but I'd say slightly over 10min?) anyways my point is it let you manage your time better because if you have 2 hours you can play a lot of successive ones, but if you have half an hour then you can play like 3 and be sure not to miss your bus or be late at work unless DotA where you never know what to expect time-wise.So far I don't have CONS, I feel like the game has a descent learning curve and that the skill cap is pretty high, I love the action and as I mentionned the very tight games with back and forth and great plays, which tend to happens quite often.So glad they made a sequel to BLC cause I missed that kind of top down brawler gameplay A LOT."

Buy the game.There are a few problems with this game, but should be fixed with features to come.1. IMO this game is great, but after a little bit gets stale even after switching from 2v2 to 3v3.2. Unlike some games, this game has overwhelmingly problems with countering characters. If you thought league was bad with counters well imagine that times 100.Yes the gameplay is fast paced, and based mostly on skill. The problem with just 1 character being able to counter an entire team should never happen.Once that is fixed the game will be 100x better, and I will probably 100x my playing hours lol.Anyways im a big time league player, and if you liked league, but hated the grind.

This game makes you feel like you're in control of a cool action sequence from a high budget fantasy film every 10 minutes, and the wide array of characters means your matches will contain a significant amount of variety.My only criticism is that of the planned free to play model.  I can understand the appeal of f2p - I played League for years and did not mind the unlock grind, but having moved to Overwatch in recent months I have come to really respect allowing players to have all of the characters for free while providing fun cosmetics to unlock and/or buy for cash.  It feels good to buy a game and know you have everything available from the get go, and I wish Battlerite would consider a similar model instead.  I would even be willing to pay for expansion packs or something, because it shows that developers respect my time and money enough to let me focus on playing the full game without suffering from grinding for new characters and dealing with the flood of free champions every week that became tedious in League of Legends after a while.  If they do a good job supporting the game with cool content updates, skins, mounts, voicelines, etc I am sure people will throw a few bucks their way to support the developers and access the fun cosmetics."

76561198050263083,Recommended,504370,25703957,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,THE PWNER,"This game is a fast paced bullet/slashing hell. In Battlerite you play as a champion (either a melee, support, or ranged champion) and either do 2v2 or 3v3 against AI or other players. There is a ranking system that palces you against other players of equal level as you which allows players to compete against other players with equal skill. Champions can be leveled up and as a result the player may recieve coin, gems, or chests (coins and gems are used to edit the champion while chests give random outfits and such). The chamion ranking stops at level 10 and sorta forces you to take on a new champion which is a bit of a bummer. Now the gameplay itself is fun, fast, and overall well made. You will find yourself in close situations where it is only you and one other players as the arena shrinks around the two of you. Then you either clutch it and rain victorious or get rekt and begin to cry a little bit. The game has little bugs, yet needs some improvments such as more champions, more new diverse maps, and finally a larger level up range for champions (maybe a small bonus or special outfit/weapon to show off). Overall, I reccomend the game to anyone who wants a fast paced exciting game. I give Battlerite 9/10 Croaks"

Expect to get stomped for a few hours but it's worth the time to learn, once you get it combat is very satisfying.If you're not a fan of League or similar MOBA titles then give it a go anyways.

,Recommended,504370,25775959,"Posted: 29 September, 2016",all,Cent,"Battlerite condenses MOBAs down to teamfights. This can be great, like a rocket league version of dota. You jump in, casual or competitive, play quick rounds with all action and no frills, no items to memorize, no hundred+ heroes to recognize. There's no RNG, no gimmicks, just the same team fights, over and over and over.Which leads to the one potential downside: It's JUST teamfights. Like a movie, even a 5 minute one, it cannot be ALL climax. There must be some build up, otherwise even the best moment lacks memorability. In the same way that losses are merely fleeting pinpricks on your ego, wins are as well.I still think Battlerite is fantastic. It accomplishes what it sets out to do with AAA polish, even in early access. I worry though, that despite having gameplay depth, it will have trouble having lasting appeal without resorting to adding new heroes every month like every other MOBA. This however, is a troublesome flaw with their design, not their execution, which is more than I can say for many games today."

I know it's just adding to the hype train, but if any game deserves to by hyped it's this one. The advertising it right when it says ""it's the best teamfight you've ever had, over and over again."" It's surprisingly balanced for early access (though some heroes are certainly being played more than others) and it's a great time fighting even, quick, and exhilarating battles. It's truly a great time.One bad thing I will say is that it's fallen prey to the fault of being an early access game with microtransactions already functioning in it. That said, there are very few problems with the game as it is, and it feels pretty much finished, aside from the addition and balancing of more champions. The microtransactions themselves also aren't too painful, as at the moment they are purely cosmetic, Overwatch style. However, in the future after this game comes out of early access and goes free to play, it seems that they'll be using a classic hero rotation system for those who didn't buy in now, so you'll have to deal with that as well.All in all though this game is truly fantastic and I hope it continues to enjoy a good community and a large playerbase.

Could of course use a simplified chat system (or at least more direction in that area) and some voice chat support, but that's a very minor complaint, the heroes are well designed and thought out, though some of them can feel a bit more similar than i'd want, still enough there to make interesting teams and strategies.Really the determining factor in a game like this is longevity, how long can one play it in one sit before it gets dull? How often will new content be added and how satisfying will that content be? With games like this with a strong competitive aim, that will be what determines the scale to which this game really blows up, in my opinion.Overall i'd give it an 8/10.Amazing so far, but could use a few minor tweaks, and in the long run, has to keep building upon a great framework to reach the level it has potential for."

The matches in this game don't conist of farming for part of the game. And hour long matches. This game is simply the combat. And the combat is great.

Learning one champion's ins-and-outs will take about 3 or 4 hours; then several dozens of hours to masters to be certain but figuring out what everyone doing at a glance should only take a day or so; as the champ pool grows this will become a problem for newer players.The tutorial is mediocre; it will teach you the basics but leave out a LOT of very important information including but not limited to: Status effects, how to use a few of your own skills, and items/powerups useage and importance.The community is friendly (for now) and thankfully everyone's chat starts DISABLED.I haven't played  too much but just from the last two days I think I can confidently say that this game has potential to become one of the better E-sports."

Some are on cooldown, some consume charge generated by using other abilities.Beware if your internet isn't great, or you live in a remote area - since even small amounts of latency will cost you matches. (Rejoice Australians, there are AUS servers!)Progression:Since combat is skill-based, there's a high skill ceiling to each character, with use of skills and positioning being crucial to success.In early access, no characters are unlocked over time, but cosmetic items are earned by leveling characters and completing daily missions (to use characters from certain pools).There's no gear treadmill to grind here.Story:Nearly non-existant, giving only short backstories on characters, no single player campaign.Graphics:A high fantasy art style, combat animations are clear in purpose.The top down shooter view means you rarely get a close look at the models, but they are good enough.Sound:Music is enough to get the point across without being distracting, and the sound design doesn't have any jarring misses."

The game is fast paced and the 3v3 combat (so far my prefered out the modes availble) . Kinda already one-tricking Poloma so it means the game must be doing something right.....battlerite that is, and I'll show myself out."
