,Not Recommended,504390,26083542,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,Valore,"This is a review purely to list issues with this game, for those who are considering a purchase.To be absolutely clear, the game itself is perfectly decent. It has great art, and a decent story. Not the best VN I've read, but it is clearly a labour of love which focuses on having a decent unique story with good art.However, there are some issues with it which may put off some people, myself included, which I hope will help in any purchase decision.Firstly, for those who are accustomed to playing VNs, luxuries in terms of interface and navigation are completely absent from this game. Examples include:1. No ability to speed up text for those of us who read quickly, or who want to text skip to see the results of other options2. Very few customisation options, for even things like SOUND in the options menu3. Zero ability to go back and select another option, because the game forces you into an autosave feature, without any options for manual saving.I know number 3 is a controversial one, but I'm of the belief that different people have different ways they want to enjoy the game. To intentionally grief them by not having a load system to pick different choices is stupid. Please don't do it.This is further compounded by the fact the game has the very common flaw of having vague choice descriptions, which often lead to the protagonist taking actions and producing outcomes completely unforseeable from the choices you made.Overall, go ahead and buy the game, but it has very clear and annoying flaws I hope the developer will take a note of and fix, or change for any future releases they make."

,Recommended,504390,26031166,"Posted: 14 October, 2016",all,catgov,"Foreword:A few hours ago a friend of mine logged to tell me about this visual novel. I checked the game title, I never heard of it. I checked the development company, I never heard of them. I looked at the trailer, and the art style intrigued me enough to try it out.Along the Edge is a visual novel that tells the story of a Ph.D. student that due to certain circumstances is forced to give up on her research and move from the city to a town. It is a fairly interesting story of self-discovery, of family grudges - possible ways to solve them (Stabby! Stabby! Or other more boring venues of conflict resolution...) and between scientific reasoning and the occult.Aesthetics:Along the Edge has an interesting aesthetic to it. The graphics are very good for its genre. They fit the story and do not disturb the reader. The choice to use pastel paintings as the imagery and the piano notes that play as we are reading help cement the rustic feel of the setting and enforce the idea that we are in a small town.The characters portrayed fit their environment and act in a logical manner fitting their constructed personality, depending on your choices their reaction to the reader will change in a believable manner (events do not feel forced upon the reader) and depending on your choices the character's appearance will change to fit the reader's decisions (a nice touch for immersion).The characters are not voiced (some might find this a plus for immersion – imagining character voices or a minus, I have no stance on this).Functionality:The game has a well thought out alignment system that helps define the character using four symbols: the sun, the moon, the globe and the star. You gain points in a certain alignment depending on your decisions.Points are granted per choice. The alignment is bidimensional, it affects your attitude (sun or moon) and beliefs (globe or star). The consequences of those choices are visible and change the way your character looks and how she acts in certain scenes (the changes are noticed are just in small segments of text but affect the overall feel of the story). If you are positive to people and conciliatory you gain sun alignment points (no numerical value is given - they are lit after making a decision, I use the term points because it is easier for me to explain the system); if you are direct and focus on your views, even if they hurt the interlocutor or damage your social position, you gain moon points; if you are rational, a sceptic and follow the scientific method you gain globe points and if you believe in the immaterial and occult or have an inclination towards intuition and instinct rather than the concise you gain star points.I did not encounter any game breaking technical issues (I encountered issues with steam overlay getting stuck while in fullscreen mode and using the F12 key to take screenshots only worked after alt+tabbing from the game and alt+tabbing back - 16.10.2016) or glaring spelling mistakes while playing.The game does not have a skip functionality, it might be a bit tedious for some after multiple playthroughs.The game's options are very limited. You can choose between sound or no sound and the display settings are either fullscreen or windowed mode.Achievements are granted after finishing a route.Enjoyment:I found myself taking it very lightly while reading and before I knew it... it was over. Before I knew it a good hour has passed and I was very satisfied. The developers tell a concise and well-written story.Conclusion:The pricing on this game is adequate for its genre and for what it has to offer (finishing a route is 1 hour – 1.5 hours, judging from the achievements there are at least four routes). It is not a monumental work like G-Senjou no Maou, Steins;Gate, Muv-Luv etc... but it has its place. It is a very good western visual novel and I think most of the fans of this genre would find it very enjoyable.Other notes:Adding this mention after reading an article on Rock Paper Shotgun written by Brittany Vincent where she mentions that: ""there are 60 different endings"". I thought I should mention this as my claim that ""there are at least four endings"" might be a bit of injustice to the game's replayability, I played a few more playthroughs and I can confirm that there are a lot more than four variations to the endings based on the choices made (to not spoil the story I will just say that people either are alive or dead, you are either with Mr. X, Mr. Y or single etc.)."
76561198158309410,Recommended,504390,32952004,Posted: 28 June,all,Lady Chaos,"""Along the Edge"" was a great experience for me. I've played it twice already and I will surely play again in the future, just to see more of the possible outcomes. The game itself is short - one playthrough takes about 2 hours, but in my opinion, it's well worth the price. Writing is solid, protagonist is interesting, choices are not obvious (no morally good or bad decisions) and lead to various consequences (including protagonist's personality, responses and looks). Every character has something redeemable about them, everyone has some sort of motive and goal. I love the art style - there are so many various CGs, that this itself, should justify the price. Also, music is absolutely stunning and adds to the atmosphere.My only complaint would be lack of skip option - replaying the game would be much more enjoyable experience if I could skip seen text.Other than that - I strongly recommend it."

I love these types of games, which was what drew me to this game.You play Daphne who has just inherited her grandmothers house and is leaving her old life behind to try and start again. However her family name causes a stir in the town and leads to interesting developments. You then have to try and figure out your families mysterious past all at the same time as trying to save your home from those who want to take it from you. The choices you make will change Daphne and the way others look at you. This includes her personallity and appearance.Your choices effect Daphne are split into categories such as The Globe, The Moon, The Star and The Sun. One or two of these will be influenced by your choices. The game states that there are no good or bad choices they just effect how people and you look at yourself.The artwork in the game is stunning some of it looks like painting that I would gladly hang up.I would recommend this to anyone who loves visual novels and choice based games."

,Recommended,504390,28673223,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Treetion,"This game gives me the same hollow feeling I had after finishing Life is Strange, the feeling where you wish the story is real.  I kind of hope the game develops its own universe and sequel/prequel and stuff, since you can get through one story line in about 2 hours it leaves me desired for more.  Wish to see what the developers come up with next."
,Not Recommended,504390,26311891,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,sekti,"When I read that the game is set in an “adult universe” I took this to mean that it features a deep storyline told with multifaceted, original characters, touching on important existential problems.What I got was a promising setting with an interesting protagonist and beautiful art, but mediocre writing, a story circling around an old feud that I failed to feel invested in, somewhat jumpy responses to my choices, and an ending that leaves me with many open questions. Another playthrough may have answered some of these questions but I have little confidence it would do so convincingly enough to warrant starting another playthrough from scratch. Note that manual saves that would allow reassessing some key moments are not possible.I will discuss some of my concerns in more detail below, with only minor spoilers, unless otherwise noted.The ArtIt's beautiful, it conveys the mood, and there is lots of it. Just look at the trailer: The vibrant colours, the composition, the lighting. It all fits.The LanguageSadly my French is not good enough, so I had to make due with the English version. It seems the translation was not done by a native speaker, or at least not a native writer. The different characters all have a similar manner of speaking and little is conveyed through choice of vocabulary, for instance. In a few places the wording sounded questionable in my ears, and with the exception of the poetic retelling of Daphné's dreams, descriptions remain purely functional.Variation vs ConsistencyThe game responds to your choices. However, there is not always a logical causal relationship between the choice and the consequence (1) and some sequences of choices sum up to an overall implausible dialogue (2).(1) Choosing certain dialog options influences Daphné's alignment in a two-dimensional personality space. Between rationalism (globe) and mysticism (star) on one hand and empathy (sun) and self-centredness (moon) on the other. This alignment, in turn, affects the events of the game (as well as Daphné's fashion choices).This sounds alright on paper but in practice this means that advertising a particular metaphysical opinion in one part of the game (e.g. witchcraft may exist) makes you be fail at some other challenge (e.g. teach at the local school) with no direct causal link. The indirect causal link via the personality wheel was not apparent to me at the time making such consequences feel oddly dissociated from the plot.(2) [Spoilers ahead!] I had one conversation with one of the possible “romance options” that went from breakup talk “You've changed, Daphné. I don't recognize you anymore.” over “Things will have to change, and change drastically” to “Daphné Delatour, will you marry me?” in one conversation of hardly a minute. I assume this almost bipolar mood swing is a consequence of the dialogue having more ways of playing out than the developers had the resources to polish.I would have preferred a more linear plot line with the freed resources invested in making each possible variation more consistent.The CharactersThe premise of the story is promising. It may sound unoriginal that we get to know yet another protagonist that leaves everything behind to make a fresh start after a personal crisis, but the game managed to find a way to convey the peculiar mixture between anxiety and hope in Daphné's situation and got me genuinely interested in her. The other characters where occasionally quirky but not over the top. Not particularly original but (mostly) no walking tropes either. They would have made for an adequate canvas to tell a rich story.The Story[I'll try to keep it abstract, but there are vague spoilers ahead.]Unless my play through omitted theGrand Conclusion That Explains It All, it's about a rich and powerful evil guy doing evil things to obtain more power (and no ulterior motive). To this end he needs access to the mysterious MacGuffin-location in the possession of the protagonist. With the power of kindness the protagonist manages to unite the people against the evildoer (who they were too afraid to confront alone) and even his close associates realise in the end, that they were deceived.While there were some hints to suggest that the evil guy is, in fact, only part-evil, that there is more than meets the eye, or that he may be willing to settle the conflict, these aspects remained largely abstract. I failed to see any real ethical dilemma or a serious conflict of interest so if it wasn't for the guy being evil for no reason, everyone could just have been on their merry ways.This shallowness is, in my eyes, the biggest weakness of the game. There just was nothing it had tosay.Final VerdictI'm not a big visual novel player, and if you are, we may not share the same opinion on what makes a great game.What I can say with confidence is that, if you are just looking for a casual game with a good story regardless of genre, there is much better stuff out there (“To the Moon“ and “Life is Strange“ to name two popular ones). And if you are interested in a visual novel featuring rich and meaningful character customisation options, then “Long Live the Queen“ does a much better job at it.This game did neither of the two convincingly which left me with little but pretty pictures to look at."

Your choices influence how your story develops keeping you curious how it goes on.It has a nice style and it's impressing how much efford they put into the rough but effective graphics.Unfortunately the writing is a little rough, too. While the story is top-notch, the main character shows little personality (except when she's being silly in situations where the player has no control.)Taking my time, enjoying the art style and story, it took me around 3.5 hours to play through it once. So if you enjoy this type of game it's highly recommended."

I can see many paths / options that I could have taken that would change the story path nicely.I like the multiple ending/variation that's given, as that increases the replayability of the game. Unlike some visual novels, the path is quite fixed, so you dont feel like going for multiple tries.All in all impressive. Looking forward for the next playthrough choice and for the next project by this company."

DEFINITELY worth a try, even if you don't typically play interactive visual novels. It will delight you with its gentle, nuanced atmosphere and romantic conception of village life.What attracted me to this game initially was the seemingly great opportunity to change the protagonist's highly variable appearance through gameplay & decision-making. This is redeemably fun and rewarding in your first, or any other, playthrough.There is A LOT of replayability because of the many different endings for: 1 - the personality of your character/their appearance; 2 - the overall plot; 3 - relationships with family/friends/romantic npc's; 4 - all the other minor conditions/achievements. Of course, your unique playthrough ending will be a combination of all of these factors.This is definitely NOT an animé dating sim or some other quasi-pornographic garbage like that (those types of games seem to infect the steam store's homepage, don't they?). Look and listen to the quality artworks/music of the trailer. You get nothing but that in the full game. All the elements here combine to create an atmosphere that feels rural-European and timeless.This game is a pleasure and I'm glad I added it to my steam library. I eagerly see myself revisiting it during winters spent in the countryside, having made a fire to keep warm, playing it through with my girlfriend or something. Hopefully I can shape up my French and play the original language of the game, too. Cheers"

The story is lovely and interesting and the outcomes super varied.
,Recommended,504390,26572578,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,Green&purple2015,"Pros:+ A nice setting, set in a rural town.+ Has an intriguing and emotional plot that for me is not too dramatic and has a mix of supernatural and mystery.+ You get to see the impact of your choices. There is no bad or good choice and there is certainly no 'useless' choice in the game. Makes it a plus in replayability.+Characters are well written, realistic and likable (most of them) in their own right. Even Yves and Clothilde shows kinder sides to them if you are able to see it (How you shape Daphne's personality in the game)+Artwork is very beautiful. It has lots of different illustrations and the sprites are nicely drawn. You can tell how much work they have done with their art.Cons:I only have one major con for this game. Now just to inform you unlike most Visual Novel this game does not allow you to backtrack in your game play. Meaning once you choose a choice or move forward in the game, you cannot go back, you cannot save any part of the game and go back and choose another option, what you choose, you'll have to stick with it through the end. If you want to get another ending or outcome you'll need to play from scratch. Now this itself can be annoying but The developers did say that this is done to add weight to your decision, Make you think harder on what options to pick. I can accept this argument. The story itself is not so long that it will be a burden to replay from the beginning to get all the endings.What makes this a problem though is that there is no skip button. Now if you are required to play the game from scratch multiple times to complete the game it would be nice to give this game a skip button. Since it is incredibly annoying to force us to continuously click multiple times or press the space key to move forward. And if we make a mistake/accidentally press the wrong option the back to the beginning and more clicking or space spamming. I don't think it will ruin the immersion for giving us the option to skip read text after all we wont be reading the read text when we are continuously clicking or pressing the space bar.Overall I'd recommend this game. Daphne regardless of how you shape her up in the end is a charming MC and the artwork is really lovely with a nice and moving story to boot."

And all the ""me's"" I could have been if I went another way. It made me think about all that stuff I don't want to think about. What keeps me awake so many nights. And beside all the ""what if's"", I realised one important thing after finishing this game: Sometimes you don't get a second chance."

It was neat that you could be several paths for the character based on text choices and how the character's clothing changes by the choices you make. Either you embrace your light side on the 'magic' portion. As indicated by a sun for light, moon for magic related issues. Or your dark side as listed by a moon icon. The world icon at the top seems to represent rationality and a scientific mind (meaning you don't draw conclusions about magic). On my run through I got light magic. It might be interesting to go for a purely scientific ending (but perhaps a little more boring, or to try for a more 'gothic' approach. I did think the price was a little steep for something not reviewed much, but the story line was still worth it just for the amount of effort put into the story. I like that there is a real depth to these characters, and how things fill in as you go along, keeping the story fresh (this idea would translate well into a real gaming experience, if you ask me, but I'm sure you don't have plans for that at this time. Or maybe don't have the ability to make that happen, but I know a good story when I read/experience one). All the dream sequences were pretty neat too, many artistic shots for screensavers. I do find it highly amusing that you can do a play through where you marry 'blondie' but it seems like a sad option really. Frank makes the most sense, but it's nice that there's different options. Worth a 2nd playthrough at least. This is a visual novel, but do I recommend it, yes it has more story than some others out there, but it's not overly complicated either. It makes you think about life in general and relationships."

The characters keep reacting with the same face for instance.In this game the art style and character design manages to stay fresh and pretty for the full duration of the game.+ The Gameplay / Personality SystemWith other choice-centric games that change the character like Mass Effect, I often find myself looking at how I want to become. Then I gun for one way. The choices are basically pre-defined.This game made the personality system ambiguous enough so that I couldn't do that! By the time I figured out how it worked, the game was already over and a full fledged character formed under my own choices.It was quite satisfying to watch Daphne grow.- The Game lengthIt took me 2,5 hours to finish the game. As I got to the end, I felt as if a chapter was missing. Even the ending felt rushed, as if a whole scene was left out and I only fully comprehended what had happened in the Epilogue.~ The RomanceThe choices are mister nice & funny or snobby loser.I chose single."

The only bad thing is that it's a bit short and that it's just not deep enough like they intentionally keep parts of the story untold. I'd give it more points otherwise. My first playthrough was enjoyable, it may have a good replay value.Overall, awesome game, buy only at dicounted price"

,Recommended,504390,35435487,Posted: 2 October,all,Palpz,"This is a great game.A visual novel telling the story of Daphne Delatour, who finds herself embroiled in the middle of a supernaturally fuelled age old family feud, after inheriting her estranged grandmother's castle.It's a good length to tell a decent and compelling story, without ever feeling like it's dragging on too much. No filler material.The story has several twists and branches, with the choices that you make being rather important for the outcomes that occur. I've played it through enough to get almost all that could be seen (just missing two achievements).I think they do it well in making the choices less about you the playing picking what happens, and more so you making choices that reveal the type of personality that Daphne has, and letting the plot progress from there. You're not choosing what she does, you're choosing who she is. I really like that from a VN.The art direction does a wonderful job of setting the tone of the game, truly making you feel immersed in a surreal experience. The soundtrack is simple, but likewise helps set the mood.This is a game that makes no effort whatsoever to adhere to the typical anime tropes that always seem to drag down most visual novels out there, and for that I absolutely applaud it. We need to see more of this."
