While there are many games out there, especially mobile games, that do exactly the same, Optika seems to be the only one (correct me if I'm wrong) approaching it with single photons forming a beam of light, which gets closer to the particle-wave characteristic of light than just a solid beam. Then again, it lets you change the speed of light, so the real physics stop as fast as they started.Pros:- Lasers- epic colors (you can take some really nice screenshots)- frequency conversion (it's even cooler in reality)- LasersCons:- the magnetic fields make you go crazy and their amount of influence on the photons is unrealistic- changing the speed of light gives away the realism(changing the speed of the photons is only required because of the magnetic fields, removing the first would solve the latter)TL:DRAs an engineer developing lasers, I rate this 8/10 (not 10 yet because of unrealistic mechanics)"

76561198025494700,Not Recommended,504400,25239460,"Posted: 29 August, 2016",all,Wrothmonk,The level design in this game is extremely poor. Several of the levels seem completely out of order in terms of difficulty. I've come across levels into the third chapter where only one parameter on an object had to be changed to solve it. I've also come across a level that was in a solved state to begin with.

Since the photons are already flowing while you're playing and you get the exact assortment of necessary items (lenses, mirrors etc.) beforehand, all you do is move/align the given items and fine-tune until the beam hits the targets. Planning ahead and logic falls flat, you don't build your own solution, you just tune a given setup. It's too easy, too limited, totally one-dimensional and boring.Could be good for kids, but isn't because of inaccurate, laughable physics (""photon accelerator"") and spelling errors.Design, Controls:Beam movement, colors etc. look unphysical and unrealistic. The item design is ugly and bland (just abstract, white symbols) and lacks clarity, so that the real ""difficulty"" is not finding the solution, but rather trying to recognize the items and what their function is. Because of poor mouse control (which cannot be adjusted), getting the desired angles is another frustrating ""difficulty"" that shouldn't exist.The whole design looks cheap and loveless with a minimal interface and menu options, as if the game was put together on a single weekend.Conclusion:Amateurish, a total failure. It's an insult to charge money for this, since there are much better flash physics games for your browser out there which are actually FUN to play and FREE of charge."

Would recommend to someone that doesn't care about beating all the levels and wants to relax for a while. Soundtrack's good though. 6/10

The both steampunk characters only appear in the tutorial.It's a bit sad, because they looked interesting.GameplaySolid mechanics like white light will be splitted into red, green and blue in different anglesBUT(big but) its a bit fiddly to hit every thing correct so you have to adjust it pixel perfect to finish the level.Only skipped 2 levels because I lost patience with them. I hit every thing but not with the correct amount of particles for the threshold to end the level. There is a little waiting time to finish it so the randomnes of the particle stream don't allow me the correct amount of perticle for the whole time. Still good game."

Seems to be produced for tablets (giant fonts, no keyb controls). But most of all, the game is not physically correct! (e.g. ""photon accelerators"" isnt something that exists, and to curve photon paths, not gravity is used but magnetic fields). So if your kid plays this, (s)he might get some wrong ideas about the physics of light."
,Recommended,504400,25271702,"Posted: 31 August, 2016",all,Maeda,"Optika is a casual physics-based puzzle game that's fun and colorful throughout. The gameplay mechanics are interesting, albeit not well explained by the tutorial. There's a lot of levels here, but the game is unfortunately easy and the game doesn't demand that you understand its mechanics completely in order to complete the puzzles. In this way, the game encourages experimentation that makes it easy to see everything Optika has to offer; on the other hand, it makes solving the puzzles less satisfying in places.Still, for $5, Optika is worth your time and money. The soundtrack is fantastic and the vibe of the game is both soothing and cheerful. Would recommend.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaN-hDW5Lzg"

Other than that it's fairly easy to play. The physics aren't realistic but I could have gotten past that if it weren't for the other problems.

You complete the 160 levels by redirecting light in various creative ways to activate receivers. This isn't really a new concept, but the beauty of the game and the interesting elements you get to use make this game unique and quite enjoyable, though, sadly, not very challenging.Perhaps I'm a genius (I'm not - I'm lethargic and kind of A.D.D. when I game), or perhaps this game was designed for children...but most of the levels here are really quite easy. Some levels feel very similar in their design. Thankfully there is a handful of levels that require real thought and planning, but they are scattered across the different ""level packs"" - there's no difficulty curve here. There also isn't a sense of gradually learning to use new elements - the same tools are used across all the different level packs, seemingly at random.I would love to have a level editor and workshop support for this game, so the community can come up with more proper puzzles.All in all, Optika is a very enjoyable experience and worth the price. It's the kind of game I would play for 15 minutes from time to time, just to relax and have some fun. If you're looking for a proper puzzler, though, look elsewhere."

The characters telling the story on the other hand feel a bit like an afterthought thrown over a good base.  For the price this is a great puzzle game with just a few rough edges."

Still fun to pick up for a couple of bucks.The details:I'll start off with the bad part of the game: level/puzzle designs. There are maybe a dozen of puzzles that will really make you think. But the rest are either just try/tweak some stuff until you manage to hit the target(s), or just plain so simple you only need to change a few things around to beat it. In one instance (about 3/4 of the game) there's actually a level where you needn't do anything, and it just solves itself (and I don't believe that to be by design!). The levels are grouped together in several packs, but there isn't any theme going on and the difficulty is all over the place.The controls are also a bit wonky, but not so bad that it is ever really frustrating, although your mileage may vary. The sound effects can be a bit annoying, but there is an option in the menu to change the volume.As for the good stuff, I'm a sucker for the bright neon lighting effects which makes the game in my opinion absolutely gorgeous. The music is really good too, although it can get a bit repetitive in the long run. There are some very fun puzzles to solve. My favorites were the ones with attractors and/or repulsors where you can create intricate patters. The lenses are fun too to fill your screen with bright colors!I still recommend it because it's quite fun and relaxing. Especially if you have kids this may be a great game for them to play with since most puzzles are quite easy. I got it for a couple of bucks and even tho I finished it in about 3 hours, I feel it was worth my money."
