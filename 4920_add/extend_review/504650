Ref Mesh Hold Function3. Space hold function4. What files should I put in Documents \ MasterpieceVR \ Lighting(ex.HDR?)

I tried Oculus Medium with the Vive, and it was horrific, there were so many issues that caused. So I tried this, and this software  is just as powerful, and is actually built for the Vive, (as well as the Rift,) so it works flawlessly, without issue.My biggest, and one of my only problems, was the poly count. I blasted it up to the highest resolution, which is ""8x,"" and i still found small adjustments very hard to do. Micro-details are literally impossible, which is rather sad. I don't mind doing adjustments my desktop, but I want the option to be able to do micro-details in VRMy other problem was the smooth tool, even at 0% strength, smoothed small details out too much. A small, jagged crease became non-existent when I touched it with the smooth brush, when I just wanted it smoother, because it was jagged. But I think that goes back to the low(ish) polygon count. If the polygon count was higher, the smooth brush wouldn't affect the polygons as much because there are more to affect.Other than that it was really good. Quickly learned the tools and got sculpting right away, and I was able to create a rather high-quality sculpt.(Besides detailing like I said.) Bit I do think they will improve."
76561198050487685,Recommended,504650,35166173,Posted: 23 September,all,Ollimator,"I just created my first design in VR. I always expected a design process in Vr somewhat different, since you see the object in full size directly in front of you, and i was not disappointed. It is definitely something that is worth exploring.Masterpiece VR is an astonishingly usable program. It is stable and it's featureset is already good. The thing I missed most is symmetry on select/copy/paste, but I guess that is in development.And I missed something like the Clay Brush and trim dynamic in ZBrush to even out larger surfaces.But of course I know these are the early days of VR modelling and I was surprised to find out that after just 2 hours I could already produce something usable and that the tools are already usable to a certain degree of detail. The FBX export works without flaws, and the generated mesh, though of course relatively heavy, is nice to use as a base for reduction or retopology.Right now I see the main strength of the app in designing, not in producing a finished model. Since Vr gives you a nice feeling of space and dimension I think the designs done in Vr will have a different twist then in 3D on a screen.I often noticed that when modelling for VR I would later, when loading the model into Unity, have the feeling that although modelled to real world dimensions the objects were not 100% there. I hope to be able to design stuff that better fits in the VR world with the help of software like Masterpiece.This is definitely an application I will explore further and I am looking forward how this will develop.On my wishlist, apart from the select/copy/paste symmetrie would be to be able to load existing models into Masterpiece and convert them into voxels to play around with hem.Also Deformers that affect larger areas of the object would be very welcome, and a snapping system or magnetic grid."

76561197977369022,Recommended,504650,29707291,Posted: 4 February,all,Adrian,"Great free program.  The closest thing we have to ZBrush sculpting in VR on the HTC Vive. It basically has two modes of creation, TiltBrush strip painting and ZBrush scuplting, that you can combine in your creations.I'm not into the strip painting thing, but I've been yearning for a good scuplting program for the HTC Vive.  This is a good start, but be aware, in it's present state, the mesh won't provide enough geometry for scuplting detailed facial features.  I hope this is something the devs plan to fix in a future update. I'd gladly pay for that.  If not, their intuituve interface and controls have shown the way."
,Recommended,504650,29510758,Posted: 26 January,all,Syrsly,"For a freebie, this is pretty good so far!MasterpieceVR isn't quite ready for primetime, but when it's done, it's bound to be a masterpiece.  As of this review, it's a pretty nice sculpting experience, similar in function to Blender's dynamic topology or ZBrush's tools.  It does not yet have export nor import options.  However, you can save and load models, and there are 4 examples at the bottom of the save/load menu.  I hope the textures are saved to the exported models when that feature is done.  I also hope the multiplayer experience is somewhat lag-free.  For now, it's free and it works well.  Have fun sculpting."

I like the brightly lit gallery environment with the wood floors, windows, etc, which is just a pleasant atmosphere to work in.I would definitely like to have export of the 3D sculpted objects, e.g. for 3D printing or post-processing in another program. I think export is planned but maybe not implemented yet."

And they helped me fix it.side note:  I'd forgotten that Materpiece programers actually answer your letters promptly, annd,  with useful answers.So my review is a solid thumbs up on Masterpiecevr. I started with Beta. which was fantastic, and this evolution , in color, in form, intensity of the creative experience, is all they promised. So, again, disregard my negative review, this is the real review. Cheers"

I havent't tried Medium or Tilt Brush though.What I like however is the simplicity of MasterpieceVR and the combination of both, sculpting and painting.What I would love to see in the hopefully near future:- Possibility to use layers- Import/export- Increased sculpting areaHaven't tried any multiuser functionality yet, but I guess this will also be an awesome feature which will make this software unique.Just please add some more features to the toolset as well."

,Recommended,504650,29615142,Posted: 31 January,all,skodone,"ive used masterpieceVr now for some time and im quite sad about that itsnot usable for sculpting much in 3d for now.The mesh resolution is so low it cannot hold any detail, having at least 2timesthe res would be a major improve, right now sculpting anything will result in formlessblobs when trying to add any detail. Something it also really needs is a scale along axisability or ""move"" function so one can stretch squash and deform the sculpt without adding orsubtracting form, right now adjusting the sculpt or simply creating forms is a real pain.Im hoping for a decent vr sculpting app for quite some time now and im still hoping :)thumbs up for the 2d features though! but 3d in vr still seems a logn way to go sadly :("
76561197976030327,Recommended,504650,29687717,Posted: 4 February,all,Flag1944,"So far this is the best creative software I've had the pleasure to use in VR. The painting is very much like tilt brush with less options and brushes, but feels just as good.The 3D Modeling is superb for organic sculpting - It feels very similar to ZBrush and you are able to get extremely detailed work out of this without any sacrifice on control or performance. Even the ability to paint directly onto the 3D model without skipping a beat. Though capable to producing hard edges the modeler tool is geared for softer organic rounded solid modeling. I'm sure you could model a mech or gun with this, but it would likely look like crap no matter how hard you tried. Though there is the possibility I missed something in the toolset that would allow for vertex / face manipulation.This program is amazing and I cannot believe it's free.If you're an artist and haven't gotten this yet--- GET IT NOW!!!I haven't had a chance to export my models into maya or blender yet, so I will update this review when I do."
76561198079025399,Not Recommended,504650,35004458,Posted: 16 September,all,Thoiter,"Various issues are making this unusable for me in it's current state.  There is some kind of weird visual distortion around the clay when sculpting, there seems to be no way to increase resolution to anything which allows fine detail, and the desktop window will not let me maximize any content from the taskbar.Update: I've now tried the Oculus store version of this and found that it is possible to increase resolution (oops).  I also managed to get some videos playing and maximizing on the desktop screen within the program, though it seems some browsers will work and others won't for some reason.The visual distortion problem persists though and that's the deal breaker for me. It's like viewing your sculpt through the privacy glass of a bathroom window, with weird jaggies in and around the material.  I have no such issues with Oculus Medium so it's specific to this software. It's very disappointing because I really like  the other aspects of this program, the user interface is great and the ability to watch videos while working is just what I was looking for. Can't recommend it though, until the visuals are sorted."

I own both Oculus Medium and Tiltbush, and this compares well to both - except that it also allows for collborative multiplayer, which is *fantastic!*Warning though: this software appears to require Windows 10 to use the clay modeling tool. If 2 people are in a room, and one doesn't have Win10, that person won't be able to see clay materials in the room (but they can still add it and manipulate it, oddly enough)"

,Not Recommended,504650,35227829,Posted: 26 September,all,Richard Burns,"For the foreseeable future I do not see this a replacement to your current sculpting software. In its current state it is more of a supplement to your current workflow. I am disappointed I had to install Windows 10 in order to utilise the sculpting feature. Windows 7 would have easily accomplished this task so I am baffled as to why the company would exclude 40+% of the windows market place.In it's current state if I were to unfairly compare it to it's more well developed non VR 3D brothers and sisters I would give it a 1/10 or perhaps generously a 2/10.To improve the score straight away I would add the following features:Note: If the features are already implemented, I apologise for being too incompetent to notice them.• Ambient Occlusion• A more fleshed out brush set• Finer control over the sculpting brush ¦¦ Eg: Stroke methods, Curve/Line/Anchored/Airbrush & Textured brushes. ¦¦• RetopologyI will update my score accordingly when the application is more stable and more feature packed.In it's current state it is not worth trying unless you have a curious streak like myself. I cannot justify the price tag as Blender whilst only Non VR 3D can out perform this with ease for free."
,Not Recommended,504650,35159271,Posted: 23 September,all,Pocky,"Can't really give it a thumb up or down since I got a refund after 15 minutes. So I'll thumb down because at the end of the day, it didn't run for me.It won't work on windows 7, something which a fair folk still use. This is the first product I've seen that does not support it. Sucks coz it looks like a pretty good program, if this changes in the future I'm sure I'll purchase again."
,Recommended,504650,29554430,Posted: 28 January,all,pansapiens,"This is an incredible tool. While Tilt Brush provides what I'd call ""3D drawing"", MasterpieceVR is 3D _sculpting_, more akin to Oculus Medium. Rather than simply drawing ribbons or worms that overlap, MasterpieceVR updates a solid mesh that you can add, subtract, push, pull and paint into the form you want. Looking forward to the addition of an export function so the result can be used in renders and game engines - it really has the beginnings of a professional creative tool in a class that will change how 3D sculpting is done."
