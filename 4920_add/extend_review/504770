,Recommended,504770,24708444,"Posted: 4 August, 2016",all,Snaut,"Slavistan is a short and sweet game that uses three different game modes to show you the everyday lives of Slavs all around Eastern Europe.The first one takes place in Russia, where you must dance to hard bass music by pressing correct directional arrows, while simultaneously moving with WASD to avoid incoming bears. The crowd of gopniks gathered in front of your glorious performance will throw you various pickups that give you protection against bear attacks as well as alcohol that refills your health.Second one is in the Balkans. You are sitting at the bar with Radovan, when he suddenly starts to argue with the Croat sitting at the nearest table. You try to calm the situation, but after so many bottles of rakija all you can say is: “jєbєm ti majku!”, and soon the whole village is after you. The goal here is to fight everyone in typical Yugoslav fashion, swinging the mouse to throw drunken punches.Last one is in Poland. You’ve clearly had too much vodka, but your friend Piotr has brought the whole tracksuit crew with him and they want you to squat outside of the “cheeki breeki” bar with them to drink even more. So you try your best to stay on the soles of your feet whilst chugging one beer after another – in usual Slav logic, the more intoxicated you are the easier it is to find your balance.For a funny little indie game made by two people this is actually pretty cool – plus at first it can be frustrating enough to make you shout “Кurwa mać!”, but it doesn’t take long to unlock all optional characters and gets old quick. I can think of worse ways to spend so little money, though it would be nice to see more game modes in future updates."

,Recommended,504770,25551963,"Posted: 17 September, 2016",all,TrapGod,"Just like the title suggests, Slavistan is a game made in honor of stereotypes covering the slavic population: bears, drinking, squatting, and of course- Adidas tracksuits.Being of slav descent myself, I couldn't see any flaws in this game's representation of slav people, maybe except the bears roaming around everywhere in Russia. Slavistan has strong arcade influences, and currently consists of 3 locations (game modes): Russia, Poland and the Balkan peninsula. In Russia, the most challenging game mode, you have to keep dancing by pressing the correct arrrow key when prompted to do so, while collecting the vodka bottles and Adidas shoes thrown at you, and at the same time evading the bears that roam around. In the Balkans (where I live, so I can pretty much confirm it's true), you engage into a bar fight, where somehow every single person (and bear) is against you. In the final game mode, in Poland, you must keep your balance while squatting behind the nightclub with your mates, having to drink in order to manage to keep your balance more easily.There are also unlockables in the game, more specifically different character models. As you get higher scores in the 3 countries, you unlock other characters such as a bear, a gopnik and your grandma.Overall, it is a pretty good slavic-themed time-killer, worth its current price of 2 euros, as it will get you at least an hour or two of fun.TL;DR: You want to see your babushka run from bears, fight bears, and/or squat with bears? Then buy this game. 100% worth it"

,Recommended,504770,24605778,"Posted: 29 July, 2016",all,Garfield Vore,"orn in Austria in 1889, Adolf Hitler rose to power in German politics as leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party, also known as the Nazi Party. Hitler was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and served as dictator from 1934 to 1945. His policies precipitated World War II and the Holocaust. Hitler committed suicide with wife Eva Braun on April 30, 1945, in his Berlin bunker.Early YearsDictator Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn, Austria, on April 20, 1889, and was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and Klara Polzl. When Hitler was 3 years old, the family moved from Austria to Germany. As a child, Hitler clashed frequently with his father. Following the death of his younger brother, Edmund, in 1900, he became detached and introverted. His father did not approve of his interest in fine art rather than business. In addition to art, Hitler showed an early interest in German nationalism, rejecting the authority of Austria-Hungary. This nationalism would become the motivating force of Hitler's life.Alois died suddenly in 1903. Two years later, Adolf's mother allowed her son to drop out of school. He moved to Vienna and worked as a casual laborer and a watercolor painter. Hitler applied to the Academy of Fine Arts twice, and was rejected both times. Out of money, he moved into a homeless shelter, where he remained for several years. Hitler later pointed to these years as the time when he first cultivated his anti-Semitism, though there is some debate about this account.At the outbreak of World War I, Hitler applied to serve in the German army. He was accepted in August 1914, though he was still an Austrian citizen. Although he spent much of his time away from the front lines, Hitler was present at a number of significant battles and was wounded at the Somme. He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross First Class and the Black Wound Badge.3GALLERY3 ImagesHitler became embittered over the collapse of the war effort. The experience reinforced his passionate German patriotism, and he was shocked by Germany's surrender in 1918. Like other German nationalists, he believed that the German army had been betrayed by civilian leaders and Marxists. He found the Treaty of Versailles degrading, particularly the demilitarization of the Rhineland and the stipulation that Germany accept responsibility for starting the war.After World War I, Hitler returned to Munich and continued to work for the military as an intelligence officer. While monitoring the activities of the German Workers’ Party (DAP), Hitler adopted many of the anti-Semitic, nationalist and anti-Marxist ideas of DAP founder Anton Drexler. Drexler invited Hitler to join the DAP, which he did in 1919.To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP). Hitler personally designed the party banner, featuring a swastika in a white circle on a red background. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his vitriolic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, Marxists and Jews. In 1921, Hitler replaced Drexler as NSDAP party chairman.Hitler's vitriolic beer-hall speeches began attracting regular audiences. Early followers included army captain Ernst Rohm, the head of the Nazi paramilitary organization, the Sturmabteilung (SA), which protected meetings and frequently attacked political opponents.On November 8, 1923, Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people at a large beer hall in Munich. Hitler announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government. After a short struggle including 20 deaths, the coup, known as the ""Beer Hall Putsch,"" failed.Hitler was arrested three days later and tried for high treason. He served a year in prison, during which time he dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf (""My Struggle"") to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race.Rise to PowerThe Great Depression in Germany provided a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were ambivalent to the parliamentary republic and increasingly open to extremist options. In 1932, Hitler ran against Paul von Hindenburg for the presidency. Hitler came in second in both rounds of the election, garnering more than 35 percent of the vote in the final election. The election established Hitler as a strong force in German politics. Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor in order to promote political balance.Hitler used his position as chancellor to form a de facto legal dictatorship. The Reichstag Fire Decree, announced after a suspicious fire at the Reichstag, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Hitler also engineered the passage of the Enabling Act, which gave his cabinet full legislative powers for a period of four years and allowed deviations from the constitution.Having achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his political allies embarked on a systematic suppression of the remaining political opposition. By the end of June, the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. On July 14, 1933, Hitler's Nazi Party was declared the only legal political party in Germany.Military opposition was also punished. The demands of the SA for more political and military power led to the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from June 30 to July 2, 1934. Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders, along with a number of Hitler's political enemies, were rounded up and shot.The day before Hindenburg's death in August 1934, the cabinet had enacted a law abolishing the office of president and combining its powers with those of the chancellor. Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government, and was formally named as leader and chancellor. As head of state, Hitler became supreme commander of the armed forces. He began to mobilize for war. Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, and Hitler announced a massive expansion of Germany’s armed forces.The Nazi regime also included social reform measures. Hitler promoted anti-smoking campaigns across the country. These campaigns stemmed from Hitler's self-imposed dietary restrictions, which included abstinence from alcohol and meat. At dinners, Hitler sometimes told graphic stories about the slaughter of animals in an effort to shame his fellow diners. He encouraged all Germans to keep their bodies pure of any intoxicating or unclean substance.A main Nazi concept was the notion of racial hygiene. New laws banned marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans, and deprived ""non-Aryans"" of the benefits of German citizenship. Hitler's early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities, and later authorized a euthanasia program for disabled adults.The Holocaust was also conducted under the auspices of racial hygiene. Between 1939 and 1945, Nazis and their collaborators were responsible for the deaths of 11 million to 14 million people, including about 6 million Jews, representing two-thirds of the Jewish population in Europe. Deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps and through mass executions. Other persecuted groups included Poles, communists, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and trade unionists, among others. Hitler probably never visited the concentration camps and did not speak publicly about the killings.World War IIIn 1938Hitler, along with several other European leaders, signed the Munich Agreement. The treaty ceded the Sudetenland districts to Germany, reversing part of the Versailles Treaty. As a result of the summit, Hitler was named Time magazine's Man of the Year for 1938. This diplomatic win only whetted his appetite for a renewed German dominance. On September 1, Germany invaded Poland. In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany"

Keep the rhythm while collecting power-ups and dodging bears in Russia. Take on hordes of drunks in a bar room brawl using only one mouse-controlled fist in the Balkans. Maintain your balance while drinking outside of a bar in Poland. Unlock new characters by hitting cumulative milestones in each game... and that's about all there is to do. Slavistan only offers a few classic, low effort games with a slight twist, but in short bursts or with a group of friends, it is great fun. That doesn't leave much in the way of actual content though, so if you aren't going to be happy with getting a half hour or less of fun per dollar, it'd be best to wait for a sale or to just skip by this one entirely.The whole game's aesthetic centers around lampooning the Slavic people by means of gathering up  all the internet's jokes about them and embracing their absurdity. Whether it's used to point out how ridiculous those views are or to sell that viewpoint isn't really clear. But the game did give me the opportunity to witness a babushka punch a bear to death, so I got my money's worth at least."

A SIMPLE TIMEKILLER, YET HARDCORE SLAV MASTERPIECEFirst LookSlavistan, the simple to describe this game with a simple sentence is that this game, is a bundle of 3 Slav-themed minigames (with each based on different Slavic places: Russia, Balkan, Poland). Each minigame puts you in a different situations that happens in Slavic Country,based on majority Western people views about Slavic country such as Russia. The game's purpose is to kill your time whenever you're feeling bored, or tired after a marathon of CSGO or Overwatch.GameplayThe gameplay is unique, in a positive way. Because each minigame is fun and challenging. The dev team surely put a lot of hardwork in this work. And you need no worry about game-breaking bugs and glitches, because I haven't met even a single minor bug.GraphicsThe developer, Free Candy Studios, serves this game in a classic 8-Bit graphics. Well, this could be good, or bad. Depending on your personal preferences. But for me, the 8-Bit graphics are on point. Since we're playing an old Slav-themed game in a Slavic country (which is partly known for their poverty and old, slow, but reliable machinery, at least most people in the Western part of the world, they see it that way).ReplayabilityYou can ONLY play the game in three ways (only 10 MB-ish though), and that will bores you quickly. But the game is kinda challenging (especially if you're trying to reach a high score), and the game has 5 unique unlockable characters that surely challenges you more, to complete your Slav character collections. So i guarantee you, this game will be your first pick when it comes to killing time or winding up after a tough competitive CSGO match.PricingIt's really cheap, you'll spend a small fortune for a good 3 Slavic minigames.And they give discounts for this game quite often.VerdictThis game is a really good choice to spend your short free time. Maybe there are some issues with the game variations, but 3 minigames should be enough to spend your 15 minutes with a jolly good fun. A definitely must buy.9.5/10P.S. Hope you're enjoying my first full lengthy review! Don't be shy to reply if you think it needs improvement"
