I hope you'll buy the game to support the creator, who seems very invested in the game.Thanks for reading!"

It's not just fun, it's got a bunch of other things going for it.Gifs!Ever done something cool in a game and thought, ""Man, if only there was some sort way I could push a button and the game would save the last 4 seconds of what I did in a convenient gif format?' Guess what! This game has that! And slow motion! That's like chocolate-and-peanut-butter level of compatibility.Stealth!No wait come back, it's well implimented. This game does stealth in the way that other games should stive to: naturally. I had forgotten there was stealth because I never used it, and there was never any forced stealth section. Cut to later on, when I saw some bushes, and decided to dash into and through them, rather than engage with the nearby enemies. It's minimal, but it's honestly such a well executed addition.An awesome developer!The fact that this game was released the 27th. and within 3 days, craigz has released 9 seperate updates fixing bugs people had reported shows how much dedication he has to this product. I've reported 2 bugs myself, and in less than 24 hours, he'd responded to both of them, and before too long, fixed the bug. What a guy!"

Other than the bugs, (such as sometimes your cubes doesn't aim where your curser is, or how sometimes the merchant goes into outpost enterance zones, making you not able to buy stuff until he leaves) it's a pretty solid, fun game.But who cares what I think, lol"
76561198064895481,Recommended,505060,30978611,Posted: 6 April,all,nanc.hormann,"Its not easy being a cube and being a war cube is even worse, but you know what is the worst of all, that you are sent back to an old kingdom, Your Old Kingdom! By mister I am so funny narrator and everybody knows you and that you were the king. But given the fact that in this kingdom everyone is a cube and the fighting makes great fun and the fact that you are kind of a king, even if your mighty kingdom is run down by barbaric red cubes, it is not that bad.That is kind of how the game of war cube starts, a small little combat game full of humor and all kind of medieval stuff. As already stated the game has good humor but I see the danger of this element becoming too powerful. In this state of the game the humor is hold back to an agreeable amount but if the game is going to define itself just through its humor, I may have to give it a bad review in the future.The surrounding and different levels of the game are drawn beautifully in a now getting so popular low poly graphical style. The world (in this stage of the game) is rather small but given the fact that it is still in early accesses it is in place to hope that the scale of the game is getting bigger and bigger. Because now the game is finished in about 2 hours. Are this 2 hours fun? Yes they are but they leave the player with the slightly uncomfortable feeling of ""I want more!"" and ""already finished?""In the whole game there is no single indication of which weapon is the best and if the newly found armor is better than the other. A situation which let me to always fight with the same weapons what is not that bad (in this stage of the game) as the variety of armor and different weapons is almost equal to zero. Moreover I think a looting system where you can get some stuff out of the enemies you kill can help the game. I know it is not a revolutionary idea to make a looting system but I desperately want this game to be developed and to give the player more to do inside of the game because just exploring and good humor is not enough. Therefore I would also love to see a good development in the tactical view as I think the rather monotone getting combat system would match very well with a bit of strategic warfare with the tactical view. And moreover it would be interesting to see what bigger battles with warcubes would look like. As I said I think that is a huge area of development that would give the game great dimension. Because what the game does till now is creating a good framework. Now its time to get depth into the game and the different game assets.I talked about a general framework of the game being created but this framework is also useful for something else, because this simple framework gives the player something to built his own imagination and own stories around. These aspect of the game principle is the same as in Mount and Blade  as the player can add to the game experience by his own imagination. For example when I hid in the bush and sneaked up to an enemy I was like ""Whoa! That's a great experience I fell like I should have felt when I played Assassins Creed 3"". No that is a bit over the top but I found it interesting that this simple game could generate the same feeling of excitement and anticipation as a huge game like AC 3.In general the now existing early access game is rather small but is already playable and gives adequate game fun and I am especially excited how much potential this game has. So with more time put into development this game can become a real winner.http://architectonreview.blogspot.com.tr/search/label/games"

,Recommended,505060,29669446,Posted: 3 February,all,DirectorHaruhi,"IntroDo you like building and grinding to build more to grind more? No? Good, because you're not doing either of those things here. Warcube is an action adventure RPG that takes inspiration from a few well received and critically acclaimed games, and andit manages to handle that inspiration wellwhile at the same time not feeling like a bunch of 'cool' features tacked on at random; the developer did a good job of making sure things fit well into the game.GameplayThe combat is great, you could compare it to Shadow of Mordor because of the combo potential with the slow motion of the 300 movie remake, but quite a bit harder as attacks are aimed 100% manually and your mistakes are easily punished by your opponents; if you rush into a group of enemies and miss one of your combo hits, your melee attack will go into a cooldown, the length of which depends on the weapon you're currently using, and you'll be stuck in amongst a large crowd of enemies with your ranged weapon and parry. If you die, the enemy that struck the killing blow will grow into a larger, tougher and more powerful enemy, and will do so again should you lose another fight to it. The videos and gifs on the storefront do a great job of showing how the combat functions, so go look at those.The game is ""open world"" in that the world is open, but the levels aren't. In the world map, you move around to points of interests, like camps, castles, towns, and other stuff, which all act as levels which you enter. Some of these points of interest send enemy soldiers out into the world which if you happen to run into, it can cause an ambush encounter where you fight a wave of 20 or so enemies. You can capture these locations, at which point they'll start sending troops of your own toa seige camp outside the first major castle, which is currently in progress. You can move near them and click on them to have them follow you into levels and encounters, where despite seeming to be half baked, they will fight the enemy until they die.Levels aren't all that complex, the objectives are pretty simple actually. Kill enemies, capture the flags and open chests for gold, sometimes doing these things aren't all that simple, sometimes the location of things isn't really obvious, sometimes what you have to do to get to the next area in the level can be hard to discover and sometimes it's just a challenge to actually get there.Something else about combat is that there's a stealth element, if you haven't been spotted by the nearby enemies, you can sneak around in the often copious amount of bushes to either get into a good position to start the encounter or(most probably unsuccessfully)sneak past them entirelyAnother thing is there's some very well implemented easter eggs and references that are there, you know they're there, but they're not in-your-face obnoxious, or in your way, screaming ""LOOK AT ME!"". I really hope the developer does more stuff like this.Story StuffThere isn't too much story yet, so far we know that you're a godlike being that has been gone from their land for almost 4,000 years, and it seems said land is in the hands of your enemy. Even though there isn't really much story so far, what's there has a nice and enjoyable charm to it, and the narrator / floaty head guy is quite a funny character. Some 4th wall breaking, but it certainly enhances the experience as it's done well.Early Access / Developer informationAs far as Early Access goes, I have very high hopes for this one. I played the very first Early Access version, which had quite a few crashes and bugs, as well as some things I was concerned about, and I contacted the developer (now this can be done through the Steam forums for the game on the bug report thread), and he not only fixed the bugs and (I think) all of the crashes, but he thanked me for reporting them and said that he's currently working on addressing the things I was concerned about. The game is very much playable in the current state and I'm confident that if something big or game breaking were to pop up in the future, the developer would be jumping all over it asap.Worth it?Worth is always subjective, but I can give you facts and my personal opinions to work with. I obtained the game elsewhere for my first playthrough, and bought it the next day despite $9 USD ($12 AUD) being a lot for me to spend on a game right now. Right now the game has 3 to 4 hours of playthrough content, depending on if you rush it or not, but it has plenty of potential for making your own fun by trying to pull of awesome combos or neat tricks with the current arsenal of weapons at your disposal as some hit harder and some combo faster and have very little cooldown when you miss, which can lead to some pretty amazing looking stuff.If the currently small playthrough time doesn't bother you, then I'd seriously suggest either getting this game, following and wishlisting it and looking back every week or so, or looking up gameplay on YouTube to see if it can change your mind.Sorry for the very long wall of text, but I've really tried to cover everything, though if I haven't you can reply to this review to ask questions and I'll try my best to answer them. Also, this is my first serious written review, so any feedback or advice would really be appreciated.I'll attempt to keep this updated within reason, although there may be a time when there's just so much more stuff that I have to entirely rewrite it."

Now, my sarcastic comment about shadow of mordor is actually not too far off. The individual enemies lack various traits, and there are not many special moves so far, but otherwise, it plays like one would expect a top-down version of shadow of mordor should. I am not saying that this is a simple copycat game, oh no, this is a game that is going against the grain to be unique, and it doesn't cut corners doing it. There is no need to take a chance when you roll with these cubes.This is a game optomized for the professional gamer, with slingshot and slo-mo mechanics, you can dish out all kinds of six-sided fury, should you have the skills.Not a professional? No problem! Combat is actually quite simple, as you parry when a symbol appeasr over your foes' heads and click on them to attack.The music give the feelings one should have when on an epic quest and is greatly improving with the help of the new team member, Blake. (Though he looks more like a rectangular prism than a cube... Whatever, I don't judge.)The graphics are crisp and unique.... I suck at describing graphics. Er... The characters all have six sides, which is nice for consistancy.As for the plot, WHO NEEDS A PLOT WHEN ALL OF THE CHARACTERS HAVE SO MANY SIDES?! Seriously, you won't find a two-dimensional character anywhere in the game. Go on, look! See, I told you.Anyway, it is a good game with a good developer. Unlike many, he has actually been updating frequently and adding good content instead of just hats... er... ah well, at least he keeps adding new features and content of all kinds.It is still in beta or alpha or... Aw heck I forget. It's growing and it's fun what more do you people want!? Now get off my lawn!"
,Recommended,505060,32399913,Posted: 13 June,all,Imban,"(This is an Early Access review based on version 0.0.5v3.)Warcube is a fun brawler, though a bit limited and easy right now due to being in very early access. The best part is being able to do combo attacks that wipe out an entire enemy group in slow motion - it's exactly as fun as it looks. The worst part is the janky Unity physics when it comes to platforming, along with needing to reposition the camera correctly.Hopefully later patches improve on the physics and camera, as well as adding more and harder content. For now I'd say that it's not worth the $10 asking price due to the lack of content, but that it could easily be if you're willing to bank on it being improved in the future."

The art style is simplistic but beautifull, the game mechanics being the same way. It's amazing how such simple mechanics and controls can be used in a way that makes you feel so epic when you're fighting a mob of enemies. The developer also seems like such a great person. You can tell he deeply apreciates each and every person who purchases and supports this game. Althought I have just joined this community I can already see he actively communicates with everyone and l listens to people's thoughts and ideas on how we can all make this a great game together. I especially apreciated the thank you message from Craigz (dev). It really shows how much he cares about this project.I understand that getting into early access games can be risky. But this is one that you should 100% consider supporting. It has grown so much since it started, and the game is far from broken. You're ideas can even make it into the game.Overall: 10/10 - I can not wait to see what the future holds for this game, and so far all I can see is it getting so much better with every update."

,Recommended,505060,34451492,Posted: 23 August,all,NateRate the Narrate,"Warcube is a simple game based off of popular systems found in other games, like Shadow of Mordor and Mount and Blade. It includes top down camera that provides a nice view of your character, the ""Warcube"", as he slo-mo kills his way around levels that can be entered from an overworld.As you travel level from level you will come across loot that can be grabbed and equiped that change how you fight in game. You can tank it out with heavy armor, a shield, and a big weapon, or you can fly around levels with minimal clothing, with a dagger in one hand and a bow in the other. The best part is that there isn't any true meta to the game, any combination can work.Not only is the game itself a blast to play, but the developer is also trying his best to communitcate with the public to fix and improve the game. Each update brings more fun gameplay and hotfixes are commonly released to fix any issue that might arrise from the new patch."

As expected and told in other reviews it's not completely without its flaws yet and there's more content to wish for, but in my opinion it's a solid start.There are two reasons to buy Warcube right now: The developer Craigz has proven to be very passionate about his game. That's why I believe Warcube will become a very good game and it's good to support developers like him. The second reason is that it's incredibly fun to play. It takes some (but not too much) skills to execute the best combos and it's very rewarding.If you're not completely sure to try Warcube or not, just do it."

This game is fun to play and has a clever use of mechanics. You can complete levels at your own pace in no paticular order, you can storm an enermy camsite or you could hide in bushes and attack them by suprise. As shown in the trailer you can attack more then one enermy at once pulling a combo (sort of). The cool thing about this is that you look like badass when done correctly. Of course it is in early access so you will be somewhat restricted in what levels you can play. But because the game is updated mounthly(ish) then more levels are soon to follow. To top it all of there is the price. $10 USD isn't bad specially considering the full version is said to have much more.

It is still early access because there is a fair amount still in contruction within the game world. You will often come across areas with traffic cones lining the environment and the developers own little cube character doing something amusing while he admits that he should be working on the game. It's great that the developer took the time to add these little characters and it really shows how much love he's poured into the game so far.The controls are a simple affair, left and right mouse buttons control your main melee dash-attack and your ranged weapon respectively whilst you move around the world with WASD, space jumps. This allows the combat to remain fast but fluid, the slow motion combat kicking in when you chain attacks together. The combat can be challenging at times when arrows start raining down and the larger enemies forces you to keep changing your tactics.The world that i've seen so far is well made and charming with many little characters to interact with. A great sense of humour is apparent in all these meetings which makes you want to explore and find new NPCs to talk to.I would definately recommend this game, it's polished, charming and funny and at this price it's already a good deal. As more content is added, it may well evolve into a steal."

It is minor though.For me, it has that ""Just a few more minutes"" thing. I believe it is essential in defining a good game, for that, thumbs up!The developper seems really invested in this, I can salute that and recommend the game!"

Very responsive and active in the community...This isn't like any of the other games I have.. I have a lot of games. It's one of the more unique games I've played. I like to collect artistic/weird or interesting games. It's like Link went for a reach around on Mario (64) and shot out a whole new basket of fun.I haven't put much time in at all. Hopefully better controller supports will be added soon. There is the key binding option but I suck at figuring it out. I blame the buzz.This game is really fun even though I really suck at aiming for anything with my mouse. I couldn't draw a stick figure with my mouse so I die a lot... The graphics are so satisfying!!!! Super cute little cubes!! I love the battle style. You pretty much make a line, like mini golf games work but you are in battle so you have to be quick... and the cube goes launching at anything ahead of it. But not overkill. It's physics-ly satisfiying for a basic gamer (it is believable, you know, if you were from the world of cubes).Worth the tag. If you can afford to support Early Access with a dev that is sure to push this gem to a wonderful release point... and probably keep going after that.. Give it a shot! This is one of my better EA games.. community is great too."

He is super in touch with the community and it seems at times like the poor dude doesnt sleep pushing updates out like its nothing.

But there are some little things that just bring down the whole experience for me.  Let's start with the combat.  When it works the way it should, it's awesome!  You can string together attacks to take down a large group of enemies in one long and exciting chain and it's just incredible BUT!  There are glitches and bugs which ruin it for me.  For example, I'm trying to take down one enemy, I aim my attack, and one of three things can happen: 1, I hit the target successfully; 2, my character turns just a bit to the left or right (without me actually doing so) and misses; or 3, my character goes flying in the complete OPPOSITE direction I was pointing!  Not to mention there are some enemies that either can't be killed or take far, FAR too many hits to take down.  (Might just be me)(EDIT: An ingame options menu has been added, thanks craigz!)I would like to reiterate that I really, REALLY want to like this game.  I think it has lots of potential to be an extremely fun and enjoyable experience.  But at the time of writing this, it's not.  At least not for me.  The issues I pointed out above as well as a few others just drag the whole thing down for me, and for that, I can't recommend it.

,Recommended,505060,29529676,Posted: 27 January,all,DoubleByte,"So, I'm seeing a lot of ""received this product for free"" reviews which is awesome! Glad people are reviewing this game. But, as someone who personally always is a little leery of those, I wanted to post a ""I paid $10 for this"" review.And it was definitely worth the money.There are glitches, it's pretty brief from what I can tell, and for the love of god the movement needs to be tweaked.But it is REALLY. DAMN. FUN. (If you want to see gameplay details, I did a video of the beginning of the game herehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEMW8EhM1MU&feature=youtu.be)There is a lot of potential here: the way the overworld is set up is really clever, there's a lot of room for cool kingdom building and exploration mechanics, and the combat is stupidly fun. I haven't been this jolly about attacking hordes of enemies since my Dynasty Warriors childhood. The slowmo action is great, I actually really like how floaty the physics are, and even the rudimentary stealth mechanics are enjoyable. My biggest complaints are a few interface weirdnesses (the character screen was very unclear and buggy for me, the overworld map moves really slow but also teleports you) and the movement. It uses grid movement, so W is always up, A is always left, etc rather than AD rotating and WS being forward back...but the game isn't on a grid, and you dash/shoot in any direction. Dashing actually feels better as a movement method than walking, which is baffling.I was originally going to just try this out since it was just released today, say ""its cool"" and then wait for future versions, but I'm actually going to go finish the Early Access.So quick pros cons:Pros:FunCool combatLOTS of potentialDesigner seems nice and dedicatedCons:Obviously a few EA bugsMoving on tactical map is really slow, but also serves as fast travel which isn't explained.For the love of god make the movement turn with AD and move forward/backward with WS."
76561198143272052,Recommended,505060,29530202,Posted: 27 January,all,Mr. Mayo,"I have been waiting for this game for quite some time now. Not a long time, but I was one of those who upvoted it on  greenlight. Since then the developer has been very active in the fledgling community, being very positive and open to new ideas. So now that I have had a chance to play this game, I am very happy to say it was well worth the wait.First impressions were very good, as the game opens with some somewhat of a dialogue after you press a strange button, the mysterious voice says you have been asleep for a few thousand years, and implies that you used to be someone of great importance. The voice acting was very good, it was very professional and believable, and does a good job giving some context to the setting.Although there are not too many levels fully completed, the ones that are there show off the gameplay quite nicely. The combat seems entirely skill based, as melee weapons seem to do the same damage. In combat, each melee attack is a lunge, if you miss there will be a short cooldown and you will have to wait before attacking again and thus will leave you open to attack. However, if you land a hit, you can immediatley attack again, thus encouraging players to be more deliberate while striking. When you hold down the attack button, the game goes in slow motion and an arrow appears showing where you will go, thus making it a bit easier not to miss. Don't get me wrong, its still very easy to whif, as your movement keys are factored in during the lunge. However, in a large crowd, if you are able to keep the hits going you can almost bowl right through the crowd, this is very satisfying when you manage to pull this off as a miss will lead to certain death, as a few hits will kill you.When killed, the enemy dealing the killing blow will grow in size and pwer. If one enemy kills you enough, they basically turn into a boss fight all on their own. While most enemies die in one to two hits, the big boys can tank enormous amounts of damgae and deal just as much with every swing. The only problem is that eventually, the enemy will get so large he won't be able to hit you, though this is probably just a glitch.Ranged attacks are both satisfying and frustrating. It is very nice to land a shot and see the enemy fly off screen, especially when leaping through the air. It takes a bit of getting used to but its still fun.The look of this game is very nice, its simplistic with bright popping colors that suit the cube theme nicely. Environments are fun to explore and move around.All in all this is a fun game, combat is solid, the asthetic is nice, I like the character personlization in this game as you can buy new outfits or find them as well as other cosmetics. I look forward to seeing nerw content come out, as there are only a few levels available at this point, but I can see there is much more to come. Definetly recommend pickling it up."

I particulary like the developer interaction with the player throughout in the form of a game character, giving background and advice- the sense of humour is awesome and the overall concept a very intriguing one.Lots of nice (and hectic!) surprises too in the mechanics (particulary (i won't spoil it), but there very much is a downside to dying to a red!), the physics based combat lends for some awesome moments, i love the live map world and the ability to influence it.All i can say is...MORE!

Theres no feeling with it. Its just there. There are fighting situations you go in, yet, the music doesnt change to fit them. Meaning you get calm music in a deadly fight. This has caused me to drop marks drastically, as music is a fundamental feature. 4/10 Im really dissapointed by this basic mistake.Graphics. Are you serious. Cmon. I understand your working in the unity engine. But please. Make the graphics worth while. Please. Running at high texture and my monitors local res, still showed the bad quality graphics. A few things to fix this: an OPTION (default off) to have black lines around objects. This really drastically increases quality. 6/10WHERES THE STORY? WHERES THE LAMB SAUCE? WHERES THE STORY?WHERES THE MOTIVE? 2/10Segment: I feel bad for drilling into this game so bad. But the price really makes me hammer it.other:The inbuilt gif maker is not a addition I do not count it as a part of the game. It is pandering to a small audience, while also being used for advertising. 3/10Bang for your buckWait for content. 5/10Someone brought up that he added a thank you. This does not matter. AT ALL.The change between levels. Its horrific. You walk everywhere to your level making it tedious to go to a far away level that you need to complete. This just wastes time which is very precious in the first two hours of the refund timer. 1/10So many people have been riding the fame of the game and reccommending. But i want to express my experience and how i didnt enjoy it. Ill keep playing, but I will only do that when i feel its better."

What is not to like? For being in Early Access this game is great! Better than I would've thought with all of these Early Access games.Want to murder things 'til they are murdered!? Warcube is the game for you.*I will not explain how the game is just read the game's detailed description*9/10

While yes, it is still in early alpha, a little pricey for the time being, and maybe not to much content. People have to realize that the game is early alpha for a reason. Many more updates to come.

76561198041756431,Recommended,505060,29556023,Posted: 28 January,all,Klay Martin Jay,"Please skip to the end of the review if you just want my opinion on buying this game or not.This review is from someone who not only doesn't generally buy early access titles, but from someone who also very rarely reviews games as well.Right now, I would say the game is certainly lacking in content, but considering it is an early access title with, as of the time of this review, only a day to make progress after release, I think that can be excused for now.What there is to enjoy and play was, for me at least, a blast. The slowdown, matrix style of the combat allows for very flashy and fast paced playing. It's as simple as it gets, but it really doesn't need much more than that. Combat is relegated to only the two mouse buttons, and from there you need to keep a rhythm going with your melee attacks to keep up the combo.I am extremely eager and willing to see this game get developed to its full potential. And while I am reccomending this game, I could certainly understand someone who wants to wait until at least a little further down the line for the game to have progressed. As it stands there is only about 2 hours of content max, but if you feel you have the desire or spare money, I think this should be an early access title the community of steam should be pushing for."

76561198020060931,Recommended,505060,29530080,Posted: 27 January,all,Windi,"A very attractive game with solid core mechanics. There's about 2-3 hours of content at the time of writing. Not only combat, but also some platforming/exploration/catapulting to get some hard-to-reach chests. Haven't run into crashes or game-breaking bugs so far. The game is fun even in its current state, and the developer seems to be committed to the project, so definitely worth buying."

,Recommended,505060,29528473,Posted: 27 January,all,ryangadz,"This game is amazing and has a lot of potential. The gameplay mechanics are incredibly fun with slow motion attacks. I enjoy the humor of the cubes and the cute storyline. Sometime the developer appears in the game as a fellow cube to offer tips, which is really a nice touch.The GIF capture is really going to be fun. It captures the last few seconds after you press G so that you can share it on social networking! HOW FUN!If you're playing on a monitor greater than 1080p I would try toggling the fullscreen button on and off a few times. Before this my screen was stuck as a one sided cube! (square) It works fine now but I hope there are higher resolutions supported in the future."

,Recommended,505060,29531343,Posted: 27 January,all,daisy,"I've followed this game for almost a year, and talked to the dev a lot during the time of it being made. Seeing it go through many stages of development has been great.Although in early access, this game is great. It does have bugs and things but thats to be expected by an early access game that is being made by 1 guy.The game makes you feel awesome and the implemented GIF system is great for sharing your cool moments among friends and on reddit/imgur. This game can be very tedious at first but you get the hang of it pretty well and fast. There isn't a whole lot of content as it is but the developer, craigz, is VERY active in making the game and also very active within the community. Craigz is also reaching out to his community to get feedback and also get ideas for the game to help expand it. This game has a very bright future and buying it while it's in early access is a great option to see where this game will go.Very well made, future is looking great.★★★★☆ 4/5"
