Its very easy to play thanks to a in game tutorial. You can skip this tutorial  if you have already played the older version of this game. A lot of tracks and cars. Doesnt require a super computer to get good frame rates now.The negatives are the handling of cars is still very floaty. The cars feel like they have no weight to them. I really wish they would have improved on the handling because it feels like all the cars all have bald tires. Imagine the physics of Flat out in this game. That would have been amazing. The Multiplayer is boring. It has no pedestrians, no bots. That makes multiplayer dead.I still enjoy the game even with all of the negatives. Its fun to smash into stuff and wreck out other racers. The maps are all large and interesting to drive around in. The  price is reasonable for the amount of stuff in this game."

It seemed to  be boring and slow at the beginning, but as I progressed from the tutorial and first two levels or so it began to immediately pick up the pace.Smashing and drifting against your opponents while sliding through pedestrians is a fun, time-killing experience!The only bugs I have encountered so far were a few pedestriants bodies spazzing out, which just added to the hilarity. The cons about the game is that it should have more car customization options. The sounds are low, even when they're cranked to the max, and the engines sound weak. The music seems kinda iffy and bland to me, but this isn't much of a problem to me since I usually play my own music.Past that, the gameplay is enjoyable!"
,Recommended,505170,32726618,Posted: 24 June,all,shekerev,"Review Disclaimer -https://medium.com/@nikola.shekerev/review-disclaimer-1281697e23e4Carmageddon is a ultraviolent car combat series of games with long history. You drive cars, kill pedestrians, collect powerups and crash opponents.The latest iteration of Carmageddon had terrible game breaking performance on launch. Probably budget was over and the developers needed to release in that state. Poor reviews destroyed the game. But the devs continued to work on it, drastically improved performance, added new content and released a new version. Big game review sites slammed the game again.Current state of Carmageddon:- Performance - excellent- Camera - it has been heavily critiqued but I have zero problems with it. I found myself in a few hard to see situations but that hardly justifies the criticism the camera got- Handling - it has been heavily critiqued. A lot of cars are difficult to handle. This point needs a bit of discussion. I believe people misunderstand why the game is intentionally designed like that. When you drive fast, you never feel in control. You are a slip away from wrecking your car. You feel vulnerable. Nowadays gamers are used to power fantasies like GTA, whose mechanics tell the player “Your♥♥♥♥♥♥is so huge you can kill anyone”. Carmageddon is a nihilistic power fantasy, it says “Everyone dies”. This also contributes to the feeling that you are driving a vehicle that is not your exact avatar but has a mind of its own, you know, like a real damaged car on uneven terrain. Also cars with poor stats but good handling are viable choices. Handling is as it should be, but I would understand why this may not be your thing- AI - it has been heavily critiqued. In my play sessions enemies were able to navigate the complex levels, find me and kill me. Pathfinding is excellent. Enemies will not hunt for power ups and will rarely use the ones they pick up. So they are not like humans, no AI is, but they are definitely not stupid.- Very heavy emphasis on dark humor- Imaginative game modes- Imaginative power ups- Imaginative levels- Physics engine is a work of art- Imaginative vehicles. Some of them have unique mechanics to kill pedestrians like slicing, impaling, sucking them into a turbine. In previous games vehicles had various blades too, but here there are different parts of the code for realistic behavior according to the shape of the blades- Levels have police cars that are genuine danger to the player. This is cool and contributes to the “Everyone dies” design philosophy.- You upgrade your cars by collecting tokens. This part of the game is very poorly explained so I will do it here. Tokens spawn more if you do not have unused tokens in your inventory. So you are rewarded for experimenting with upgrades and not hoarding them. Tokens spawn more when your car is not fully upgraded. So you are rewarded for experimenting with cars and not only driving your most upgraded. When those conditions are met, tokens spawn everywhere and you are rewarded for exploring the whole level. When you understand this mechanic, it works wonders.Conclusion - in its current state Carmageddon: Max Damage is a wonderful game, one of my best purchases and a true reminder why games are awesomeAlso Carmageddon taught is 3 valuable lessons- Game development and any software development is hard and bad luck can ♥♥♥♥ even the best of us.- Big game review sites like IGN and Gamespot are full of♥♥♥♥♥♥- The culture of the games industry is toxically broken. If a developer ♥♥♥♥s up hard, but then drastically improves his product, the industry will not care. This is a problem, we do not reward continuous effort to improve. And then we wonder why big companies never fix broken games. This is the most important lesson of CarmageddonFor reference this is the full list of all games I have played -https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TWIl51GFWuHPMp_amlvFqQCUdcZxsWQqkJgztGJBo0s/editMore articles and mini reviews —https://medium.com/@nikola.shekerev"

The game runs wonderfully and it looks much nicer then Reincarnation. There is a good selection of cars to unlock and a decent amount of game modes as well. The presidential canidates game modes are entertaining and helpful with getting frustraitions out with one of the worst elections in U.S. history.  The game is certainly worth the price, and I hope to see more content to the game soon."

The environments aren't identical to the original Carmageddon game, but there are quite a few throwbacks, like the first city track. Lots of new powerups, most of which can be selected and activated at will.Most importantly, the cars' handling and feel is great, in that it feels like a racing game when you actually decide to race. The cars have mass, you can powerslide etc. The car-on-car violence has been greatly improved upon, too, and there are way more implements for it.Graphics fulfill their purpose, but there's no ""Ooh!"" factor here. Audio, on the other hand, is well-designed. All the bangs and screeches sound fulfilling, and the soundtrack is mostly good too. It's also worth noting that some of the music is  familiar from Carmageddon 1, for example those instrumental versions of Fear Factory songs.Haven't tried multiplayer yet, but the career more seems excellent. Highly recommended if you liked Carmageddon 1."

This is an incredibly fun game that doesn't take itself seriously at all, and it's totally worth firing up after a long day just to vent some frustration and have fun in the over the top races while you chase down people on bicycles and smash other cars to bits.

Project cars eat your heart out.The game play is fresh, new and exciting.. a delightful spin on the racing genre with wonderful driving mechanics and physics.NOPE..Let me start again. If you know your gaming history you would know that back in 1997, when Music was superior, hollywood actually made good movies, (that where not just endless superhero reboots) and western culture wasnt creatively bankrupt. Video gaming was still a developing industry (not the billion dollar greed factories they are now) finding its way out of the gaming dark ages.Along came a game.. the original Carmageddon, this was different from most other racing games of the time...it did something new.. 'It offended people'.It offended people so much that newpapers hated on it, governments banned it and mothers blamed it for their brats bad behavior.But before it was even released some dressed up suit with dust on his shoulder pads and a cleft lip decided that the world was to fragile for a video games influence on young malleable minds that the game was censored before release and instead of red blood and human carnage the game presented us with green blood and Zombie carnage..The eager amoung us, who spent months salivating at the thought of getting our digital pound of flesh (made ohh so tangible by an over played Demo version released on CDROM disk sold with gaming magazines (remember those?)) that when the game was finally on the shelves... installed and played it was received with a collective 'WTF!?!?!?!' that could be heard across the world.But censorship never works as we all know and it wasnt long before the original gore sprites and a convenient batch file to install them, found its way out into the world.The cleft lip guy cried a river.And Carmageddon was 'hilarious fun'.. Especially with friends at a LAN party using Novel netware. 6 hours to configure the network and 3 hours of game play.... Priceless.2 sequels where made, the 3rd of which being made by some other dev team and it being rubbish.Carmageddon faded into relative oblivion.. Games like Grand thieft Auto came along a little later and the rest is history.--So what do i think of this new version of Carmageddon?Well, its the game i remember, In fact a couple of years ago i recently completed the mobile version of the 1997 game on my Android smart phone and i can honestly say that Carmageddon: Max Damage is the same game.Obviously the visuals are better and the mechanics are more fleshed out, but from a creative perspective this new game does nothing new at all. Even the maps are the same.Back in 1997 Carmageddon was a fresh new idea, An open world racing game with the actual design incentive to smoosh pedestrians in the game world... Something we all wanted to do when playing Colin Mcrae Rally but never could.Now that we are in 2017 with a huge list of open world games, set to stunning visual backdrops and of course the now 'Expected' realism of killing pedestrians being common place. i can hoestly say that Carmageddon is a dinosaur dressed in dried mammal skin.You would only really buy this game as a sentimental purchase if you remember the original. The visuals are a huge improvment over the original, but by todays standards are seriously underpar. The game play is repetitive and irksome, Im still being jammed up against the walls by Police units that just will not relent, It was Infuriating back in 1997 and its still Infuriating in 2017.Once upon a time this game was special and i loved it... but im quite honestly spoilt now by everything that has come since and i find myself only playing this game for short periods before quiting and playing something else.However i do keep coming back for a short session and i am engaged enough to not notice that clock tick by.... until i start getting fidgety and catch myself yawning a little.So in a nut shell.If you remember the original and want to play the game as you wished it could have been back in 1997 and you fancy a walk down memory lane, Then maybe this is for you.I got this game on sale for £3.75 which to be honest is a steal. The full asking price of £14.99 is not realistic in my opinion, ive played better looking and more interesting games on mobile devices for much less.Yes - on sale. (and you remember the original)No - Full price (and you are a spoilt millenial)"

Then this game is for you!The adrenaline killing/driving game I was waiting for!Sure, Gas Guzzlers is pretty good, but it is not Carmageddon, and the older games similar to Carmageddon are sure great, but not exactly the same.You love FlatOut? Derby racing? Adrenaline and violent games? Then look no further, you got all of that in one in this game.It has a decent amount of levels but it could have more vehicles, so in the end, content-wise, it could be better.but gameplay-wise, look no further, it is really fun!Music is pretty good, except for the techno stuff, but as you drive and kill people, it won't matters, as long as the music is loud! Sure, it could use some death metal and more heavy metal stuff but it doesn't matters to so much, just play your own music.It could really use a workshop, an level editor (creating our own maps/levels) and mod tools (creating our own vehicles, skins, peds, content).I'm giving it a 8.5/10 overall, the game could be really better if it would have a workshop, mod SDK/tools and a map editor, more vehicles would also be really great!Seriously, what the duck are you waiting for? Go and buy this game, then start the carnage!"
,Recommended,505170,33001382,Posted: 29 June,all,Ankh,"So you heard about a new Carmageddon game called Reincarnation, and you wonder what is this ""Max Damage"" then?Assuming you heard about Carmageddon: Reincarnation, you probably also heard that it didn't do so well; early access, buggy, poor optimization, lack of content.Carmageddon: Max Damage is essentially Carmageddon: Reincarnation coming out of early access and fixing the issues that came along with it.Keep in mind that I'll be comparing Max Damage to the old Carmageddon titles throughout the review.Handling:This seems to be the biggest culprit that drives new players away from this game, to a point where I saw people refunding it. Yes, the driving does have a learning curve and takes a bit of time getting used to. But if you played the classic Carmageddon games, you know that it's impossible to make a sudden left turn while driving at 150 km/h.Not to say that games should never change, but realistic handling was always the core of Carmageddon games and once you master the driving, the game becomes much more fun.Combat:If I recall correctly, the reliance on power ups to defeat your opponent was much lower in the classic games. Your gas pedal was your main weapon and while power ups did help defeat stronger vehicles, they never felt like a necessity. In Max Damage I often find myself hitting my opponents' car over and over again until I give up and purchase a power up to finish them off (you can now buy power ups with credits you earn).Only when you get your hands on the big boy cars it becomes enjoyable to smash opponents.AI:The AI in this game is ferocious and can be a nuisance. Unlike Carmageddon 1 and 2, here the opponents won't leave you alone until your car is wrecked and can definitely take 1st place in a racing game mode if you're careless. Pathfinding also got better, AI will now use ramps and stairs to get to their objective.Gameplay:Max Damage definitely has a vibe of the old games, especially the first Carmageddon. While only certain elements were borrowed from Carma 2, Carma 1 is the one it mostly resembles. Bringing back annoying cops and stealing cars instead of purchasing them. It also incorporated the classic multiplayer game modes into the singleplayer campaign such as Car Crusher, Fox 'n' Hounds, Checkpoint Stampede and a few others.TL;DRIf you liked the old Carma games, you'll enjoy this. If you're new to Carmageddon it might take a bit of time to get used to."

Everything is polished now - runs nice and smooth. Developers finally fixed framerate issues - I can run C:MD on highest graphics settings with stable 60 FPS while I was suffering with 20-30 FPS on average settings in C:R.Car handling seems better now. Maybe it is thank to stable framerate, but maybe devs tuned it up a little bit. It still far from ideal, but what did you expected from Carma? :) New in-car camera looks neat but obscures  too much vision.And the best part - C:MD came absolutely for free to C:R owners! No DLC, no upgrade cost. REALLY FOR FREE! It was a way how Stainless Games said ""sorry for bad C:R - here is a product that you really expected when bough/kickstarted C:R"".

So far the Kutter, and Val Hella's car are the ones that handle terribly where you would expect them to handle quite well. Centering of the wheels occurs so quickly that they always are thrown into a spin the opposing direction of your turn. I can not see this as a feature, but it seems mostly these two cars. I know some cars are supposed to have handling that sucks in this game, but these two weren't included in that previously.I love this game. I have almost 100 hours on Carmageddon : Reincarnation. The previous title actually worked relatively well for me, but this is an improvement for sure. Everything runs smooth as butter on maximum details with my GTX 970. Oh yea...IN CAR CAM!!!! Yes. Yes. Yes.Some new cars, some new maps, some new sound effects, many new pedestrians. The extra model/design for the Eagle and the Hawk are amazing, can we get that treatment for all the cars?If you have Reincarnation then you now own this as well, if you stayed away from the last iteration due to concerns about performance you should now be able to put those worries aside.Multiplayer with friends is a real blast (so you can agree to not just hold the repair button). I like to come up with all sorts of silly games using different cars.There are some modded cars available for Reincarnation and as far as I've heard from one of the modders, he plans to bring his vehicles to Max Damage as well. This would add somewhere in the range of 10 more cars.Now remember, this is not a terribly deep experience, it's blood, gore, and smashing cars. I like those things, maybe you will too.Question : Does anyone else call Cunning Stunt Bonus Stunning C*nt Bonus instead?"

Carmageddon: Reincarnation was a failure. It was buggy, very poorly optimized, and rough all around, and it had gotten to the point where the Carma: Re brand was tarnished. So, after several somewhat effective, yet still failed attempts at bringing the game to its fullest potential, Stainless Games made a great business decision and took a year away to copy and paste Carmageddon: Reincarnation into a new project, optimize it beyond all belief, polish it, add new creative content content, fix bugs, and turn it into the game we expected to recieve when we purchased Carmageddon: Reincarnation. Stainless games certainly redeemed themselves, and I thank you guys for this great game!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There's a common criticism that this game is not a 2016 game or ""it belongs in 1999"". I think that criticism is somewhat unfair, though partially true. I don't think Stainless Games should have heavily modernized this game. I think they did a great job at bringing back an old game with fresh graphics, mechanics, and content. Is the formula a bit dated by today's standards? Kind of, but I love it just the way it is, and it's a great, full experience that was crafted to revive old memories with a fresh coat of paint and some new toys to play with. Also, there's no corporate bull crap going on. No annoying microtransactions, no ""Supply Drops"", no insulting DLC practices, and when Carma: Re failed, Stainless Games did not abandon it or make half-a$$ed attempts at dodging negative PR. No, they worked all day and night and brought us what we asked for in Reincarnation, and took some of the loss by giving us owners of the failed game a new product. Now THIS is what a great development team looks like. Take notes, ""Early Access Randomly-Generated Open World Survival Sandbox #9540271620100698953210192"" scrubs..

There's a few random things like cars being ripped in half length ways rather than squashing which seem a bit odd at times but in general the damage is just more satisfying and easier to achieve.Most notably; the handling is not a big bucket of dung anymore... And it just goes to show that all the rude fanboys can stick it. I played the original Carmageddon games too and the handling wasn't great but at least the cars didn't randomly slide off the side of the map because of some weird calculation error. Now they remain firmly in place and don't slop and flop around as though on lubricated sheets of ice.Hell, I lost my♥♥♥♥♥♥when I went on the forums and the fanboys all grabbed me and took turns to jack rabbit my corn holes with strapons. I spat back like an angry little ♥♥♥♥♥ and told them and the developer Nobby to go eat on a fat one, I took the reincarnation edition as an insult. My past time of Carmageddon was trashed by that atrocity. I took back what I said about Nobby because I was just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that a bunch of rampant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lickers were defending the game like the kings men... Well that defense was in vain as this game fixed all the problems that were apparently not problems.We have to remember that it's in good character to admit when you're right and when you're wrong. I was wrong for losing my♥♥♥♥♥♥and insulting Nobby in my forum post. I really did feel insulted by reincarnation. But at least I wasn't the one fanboying a broken piece of garbage which has been proven it was stuffed by this new iteration of the series.I welcome Carmageddon: Max Damage to my Steam game library and the fanboys can suck it because now the handling is fantastic and you now have no travesty to jerk rapidly off to.This was free to those that owned reincarnation so that was a really nice thing to do for all us players that felt so let down by it. Obviously they knew the game was NOT the reincarnation they really wanted to deliver and they made up for it with Max Damage... So eat it fanboys as us normal people (or rather NOT knob cakey dunce people) didn't stand by and defend a turd that even the developers have shown was not acceptable with this beautifully kind gesture!This is now an enjoyable and relaxing title to play like it always should have been! Well done to the devs and I look forward to playing more."

Went right through the game without any crashes, slow down or anything nasty.Loads of fun, great new content.Visuals are quite fair considering the small team that Stainless are, unique damage tech made in house is impressive. Cars twist, split, bend the works. If damage is enough you can even rip other cars off their chassis!Only noticed some sound glitches, like loud buzzing when you pick up Turbo, Mega-Turbo, Hotrod. Volume is quite low, but sometimes during loading music just blares out. Once the level has loaded goes back to regular game volume.AI are not as dumb as they used to be, and actually can win events.If you sat back and watched how reincarnation turned out.

This is essentially the original game with a nice facelift, better physics, and amazing vehicle destruction (probably the best I've seen in a game so far).I love this game (and enjoyed Reincarnation as well), it's nice and arcadey, which may be a turn off to some, but I personally can't stand simulation driving. The maps are all pretty varied and fun, can't say I've played any that I really haven't liked yet (there was at least one I can remember in the first game that I hated), the cars all play and handle well once you get the feel for them.I definitely recommend it if you were a fan of the original, if not, you can pretty much take it at face value. If what you see in the trailers and screenshots here doesn't interest you, you probably won't like it, if it does, give it a whirl I'm sure you'll have a blast."

I really didn't want to, but there were some issues in the game that irked me, and the game didn't QUITE feel ready yet.  Fortunately, with the release of Max Damage, the game feels a lot better.  I can safely say now that THIS is indeed the modern Carmageddon I had been wanting to see.There are still flaws, but none of these games are really perfect.  While the performance has improved, there still seems to be some kind of memory leak that can cause slow down, stuttering, and potentially crashing.  Some of the cars seem to have a real problem with brakes, especially when you've upgraded the engine to tier 4 or 5.  It's like the brakes don't scale with the new power.  There's a few other random bugs, the the music sometimes randomly getting very loud, and the fact that the police APC seems to be missing as a playable car this time out.  [Edit: It appears the APC is indeed playable, but requires fully completing the game.]On the positives, they added the ability to stun AI drivers with a good hit.  It's such a small change, but it goes a long way.  The game's visually a little more polished, in areas like loading screens etc.  The cars added in are pretty good, and I love that we finally have working trailers.  (Perhaps we can finally see Tanka in its original form?  Though it's not in the game at the moment.)  I absolutely adore one of the new, desert themes arenas.Some of the end-game vehicles are, of course, fairly over-powered.  But that's always been the case with Carmageddon.  After all, you don't get them until near the end of the game, either by taking out a difficult car yourself, or completing all the raced to unlock them all.  And either way, by then you've completed most, if not all, of the single player content, so why not let the players indulge in some over-powered carnage?If you loved the earlier Carmageddon games, this is a worthy entry.  I do hope they keep working on it, or working toward another."

One of the criticisms people give for the game is that the maps are too large and open. However, that is part of the game play. To go and smash the opponents, have a lot of room to get around in order to do so.It is true that this game is not like other car racing games when it comes to handling, etc... However, that is part of the appeal. If I wanted a regular car racing game, I would get any off the net. However, this game is not just a racing game. No other game has the objective of killing pedestrians or destroying your fellow competitors. This really is a unique game.THe graphics are pretty good. Probably not the best, but, it is very good. My one criticism is that it can be difficult to ram your opponent. But at the same time, it also makes the game fun as well. I do recomment this."
,Not Recommended,505170,33975657,Posted: 2 August,all,TG,"This is such a weird game to review, because as much as I really enjoy the series as a whole, there's SO many nitpicks and problems I have to go over in a proper review that it's impossible for me to give this game a thumbs up.Firstly for those of you who have never heard of the series before and are down here looking at steam reviews, in 1997 a bunch of devs from the UK thought it would be really funny to make the game that contemporary christian media claimed to exist. Full of puns, toilet humour, and the whacky and zany, the game had you running over pedestrians, whacking your deranged and vulgar opponents, and showing off how boring you are by racing through the checkpoints properly all extend your arcade-like timer. The original Carmageddon was all about trying to make a profit by collecting points and finishing each race so you could continue on your career as a homicidal maniac.Carmageddon: Max Damage, gameplay wise, feels like a toe to tip copy of the first Carmageddon I played decades ago, for all the good and bad that implies.The game plays like a sim racer, where you have to manage your speed so that you don't take corners at 100mph and then wonder why the hell your chassis is a sordid mesh turning to dust. It is perfectly playable on a keyboard if you have experience with feathering, correcting and compensating, and watching your speed. One of the more annoying things about the controls is that when in reverse, turning causes you to swing your car around 180. It'd rather have control over doing that while using the game's ""wheelspin"" function, because when trying to get those last couple pedestrians with your back bumper, your driver can be too over excited and slam a u-ie, ruining any lining-up you did. As long as you come into the game not expecting Twisted Metal maneuverability, you should be fine.The cast of opponents plays as a greatest hits to the franchise, although some of my personal favourites (*cough*O.K. Simpson*cough*) don't make an appearance, the group is a great representation of what the game stands for. I probably enjoy the lore behind them way too much, and that isn't helped by thecheesy comicsthat Stainless put up on their website. Really, the only person I have a problem with on a ""flavour"" perspective is a new character named Roman, the exo-suited pickup driver. His vehicle is too clean and boring, and the limited backstory given on the character select screen does not really fit him into the game at all.One of the biggest things I will never understand about Max Damage (or any carma game) is why the repair ability exists. It seems extremely cheap, especially in the deathmatch mode, that you can repair your vehicle at the expense of credits when I've never seen any of the AI do it. I could pardon it in Carma'97 since credits were everything, and making a profit at the end of the race was key, but credits don't play a massive part Max Damage as much as it did in Carma'97 (it seems all they're here for now it for global leaderboards). If your response to the repair criticism is that ""the games would last way too long since the AI could just repair all their damage"", then you're just proving my point as to why repair should not be in the game to begin with.Speaking of which, one of the more positive things to talk about is the AI. They're extremely top notch with excellent pathfinding, using powerups, navigating tough sections with ramps, and always beating you to objectives in the non-classic modes.Another nitpick is that I have no idea what the art-style is trying to go for. The vehicles are textured with rough rusty edges a la Carma'97, while some of the environments and powerup barrels are cell-shaded and cartoony a la Carmageddon 2. It's just an odd thing to look at, but when you're more focused on running people over and pushing people into above-ground naval mines, you're not really paying attention to artistic inaccuracies.I'm sure there's a lot more for me to gripe and praise about the game, but I'm sure other people have already touched on that down here in the reviews section.TL;DR: ""I enjoy the game, but I would not recommend it to the unindoctrinated."""

For people that havent played that game, Max Damage is fun, clunky and punchy. Some Cars handle well (when you are not driving on gore/ice/oil, which is always) and some Cars are absolutely ridiculous and unusable, but hillarious. The handling is actually pretty reminiscent of games like NFSU2 when you are driving on tarmac, but the constant onslaught of gibs and gore tend to make you lose control (which is fine, mind you).The career mode progresses nicely. You start driving against cars that are pretty easy to wreck, but as the campaign progresses they get tougher and tougher. Some opponents are completely OP and you need to use offensive powerups to kill them (on hard, anyway), but thats how its meant to be (and eventually you can get their cars). Some of the game modes, like 'Fox N Hounds' are brilliant.Good game, as a reboot its successful - even if it feels a little less 'solid', head on crashes dont have quite the punch they did in C1, but you do feel them.

76561198019063757,Not Recommended,505170,30462349,Posted: 11 March,all,Auste,"A solid attempt to recreate the fun of the original that fails utterly.From the car design to the music to the map design, the creators have tried to hearken back to the splatter-tastic turbo charged gritty fun of the original, however relentless nickel and dime opponents, a tin foil car, insane repair frees, no failure option and a shallow, performance linked upgrades and unforgiving vehicle physics make it more painful for you to play than the peds you crush - at least it is over for them in a split second.Starting off, the recreation of the original first level and original opponents is fun ... especially since, even after all this time, I remember where a lot of the powerups are. It was fun thrashing my opponents. Then, I tried to do a regular checkpoint race .. and the pain began.Every opponent is out to get YOU. They aren't out to win, they aren't out to trash each other. They want YOUR blood. If they are halfway across the map, they will continue to run checkpoints until they get close, then it is open season on your bumper. This means you can not play this as a normal race, especially if winnig by trashing the opponents is a victory condition. They will ignore everything else. I once had a field of four enemies, and a cop car, continually focusing me so much they starting ramming each other just to get to me ... one actually wrecked another, and none of them cared. This becomes incredibly frustring incredibly quickly especially with the damage model and driving physics.You will run forward, do a 180, and by the time you get to about 10 miles an hour your opponent is barreling down on you at insane speed since pretty much all the cars are faster than yours at the start. The damage model is also incredibly unrealistic. In order to damage you, all the opponents need to do is gently back in to you, or turn in to you from a foot away, and you can lose a wheel. Repariing even green basic damage to your car's body can cost upward of 1300 credits, with a cash barrel giving you about 200 and a checkpoint about 1000. This means if an enemy taps you .. at all.. you need to run down 5 or so cash barrels, make the next checkpoint (with everyone on your tail, and they are faster than you) or slam through a crowd of peds to make up repair cash.All the opponents have the same AI regardless of their vehicle capabilities. They all will turn as fast as they can in to you and burn full speed at you. This causes some vehicles with bad handling and high acceleration to spin all over the map, vehicle with good handling and slow speed to turn constantly in circles, but small, light vehicles with good handling and middling speed will be the bane of your existence. They will get right on you and constantly turn in you. Since they turn faster, you can't outturn them. Since everyone is faster, you can't outrun them. They will push their doors against yours and with a car that weighs half of what yours weighs and using no speed or ramming, will reduce you to a flaming pile of rubble.Getting upgrades means getting upgrade tokens. Once you find them tucked away on a map, actually USING them requires you to meet certain race and area goals. So if you just can't beat a map or a certain race .. well.. too bad. You can't upgrade.I can see the developers really tried to recreate the original, but I don't think they ever played it. It is if they had the source code and original assets and were asked to just duplicate it with upgraded textures and polygons ... and did that. I'm not sure they played the original game or this one.Protip: do not EVER apply an upgrade to ANY car until you can use them all. It seems the enemy scales based on how many upgrades you have applied to ANY car, not just the one you are driving.Do you like to spend a sunny afternoon slamming your hand in a car door? Do you enjoy barefoot walks on a beach of crushed glass or being caught in hydrochloric acid rain? Well then this game may just be for you!"

For some reason I don't know (other than busy everydays) the fact that it's in my game library skipped me for quite a long time. After discovering, it became a pack of quite nice surprises:#1 It runs so much better than the previous ReinCarma release, kudos for all the optimising. I'm not entirely sure, maybe it's because of the frame rate boost but the handing of cars seems to be improved to me.#2 As a side-effect it runs much more stabile, no regular freezing whatsoever.#3 Extra content was added that made me start re-playing it again (new maps, cars, p-ups, peds and an ample of small details).Overall, it is more balanced, has better content and got a speed boost. Fun.I must also add that I'm quite disapponted that Max Damage still not solved the customisable game controller issue. None of the A-B-C presets worked with my controllers and there is no option for a single setup of controls of a pad or wheel the way you want. That is a mistake I think as coding a control setup option instead these 3 useless presets would be really easy to by for the developers because the conrol commands are in a TXT file in a game folder where you can alter it by typing in the suitable control layout. I did it that's why I can play the game with my controller. Some time I plan to create some sort of tutorial about it, maybe it will help players around.C'mon Stainless... This game comes alive when it's played with a controller / wheel and is just a fracture of fun with a keyboard. I guess you could code a control setup utility update in 10 minutes or so. I can't see a single reason of not doing so.Other than that it is a definite Carmageddon experience. Carma II is still my favourite (due to nostalgic reasons, I admit) but Max Damage is close behind, nailing the player to the wheel. Well, literally. Maybe not literally, ingame."

However there are a few things a potential buyer not familiar with the series should know:1. The racing is secondary. If you are looking for a Forza clone or even an NFS type experience, look elsewhere.2. The handling  is beyond arcadey and in fact is sometimes wonky and unrealistic. Mario Karts handle better and sliding around like you are on ice is par for the course.3. The stupid and crassness of it all is half the fun.All I really its a great remake and worth your time and money."

It's literally the same thing but actually finished and polished. As sloppy as the release of Reincarnation was, I'm glad that they pulled it together and did this, especially with the fact that Reincarnation owners get this game for free.Overall, a very fun Carmageddon game worthy of standing with the rest, and doesn't seem to have the lunar physics of the early games, which was my biggest frustration with them."

It's more of a graphical and systems update of the original than a true modernisation - and those graphics and systems aren't anything to be excited by in 2017.The handling/traction is the fly in the ointment for me. It's clear that the devs have tried to preserve the feel of the original, but given that the original wasavery old school racing game it ends up feeling very strange. You get used to it but I think it was an odd decision. In fact having recently replayed the original I'm tempted to say that it had better handling!And the one thing that didn't make it from the original is my favourite thing about it!

Reincarnation could not run even in full HD flawlessly, but this game runs solid in 2560x1440 on the same config, with a relatively cheap and weak video card (Radeon 7870). The graphics, the engine, the car handling has been all optimized, moveover, the graphics is rather beautiful now. Now the car improvements make sense. The pedestrians have been redesigned, new types added, but there is still some place for improvements here. Also, the AI seems to be okay. I also tried multiplayer, the netcode seems to be fine.

If you played the first game, or you are curious what it was like, yet you don't want to grab the old Carmageddon, it's a good choice. If not a fan, or would like to play some car game, this is not the game you 're looking for.Pros- Carmageddon atmosphere, featuring both the bloody carnage of the first game and the morbid humour of the second.- Recreates some elements of the first game (the football stadium for example).- Some good old racers, along with crazy new faces.- Cows wearing hazmat suits. (Seriously!)- Cows wearing hazmat suits that dance if you get a special powerup.- The game features disabled people. You have the option to run them over and everyone says it it a sick thing, secretly everyone hunts them down.Cons- Car control is almost non-existing. Prepare for raging. LOTS of raging.- AI is non-existing. The other drivers are not opponents or rivals. They are just dumb in the most annoying way.- Cops chase only you. Well, if not, it totally feels like. It's annoying for most of the time, but in game modes where you lost points if you die, cops are your worst nightmare.- Where are the other former racers? (Agent Orange and his car, Leadpumper for example)- Few new racers.The price of the game is OK if you grab it on sale (under 15 EUR), or you want to max it out and play multiplayer too."

It runs smoothly on my rig and I hardly experienced any bugs or crashes.I jumped in a few MP matches, but didn't like it very much. Hard to find any games, if the host quits, the game is over.

It's a silly game with silly physics, crazy cars and stupid powerups - if this is your thing, get it!For Carma fans some features:- You upgrade your cars now with tokens found around the level- You advance the career by completing events- You unlock new tiers (levels that contain a certain number of events) with total money earned- You unlock new upgrades for your cars with the tiers- All the classic cars are there- Cosmetics/skins for the cars have been implemented- Peds are well designed, need more power to kill them since they are no sprites anymore"

Meanwhile you're skidding because you're already goingtoo fast and adding gas to the equation will continue to suffer your turning radius.So with or without control of the car the physics seem sound to me in this game.I feel like I can take that red muscle car and go for a slaughter run with sound physics although thepower-ups provide for additional wacked out physics.  They seem to be the arcade like part of the game.I love this game flat out.  Especially when I play to complete the laps because the track is always a bit differentwhen you need to continously run over pedestrains to put time on the clock.  This will test your racing skills.My advice for keeping control when the front of your car is bobbing left and right is to lay off the gas andthen when the car has slowed down a bit hit the gas when your car faces frontward to pull it straight.And use the hand-brake only when you need to throw out the back end to hit pedestrians or on a hairpin turnor if you need to do a 180.Great mix of arcade and what seems to be sound physics concerning traction.I'd be happy to be informed about what physics have been made arcade like aside from the effects of the power ups.I don't know if they got it wrong for tracked vehicles or vehicles with six wheels as I'd have to experiment to find out.I love the game just like the original one.It's definitely worth a great many people's time.Good work Carma team.

It lacks the option to purchase cars after a battle (instead you ""steal"" them by wrecking them - a bit silly). Overall, it feels more like a console game than the proper PC game that C1 and C2 were. Let's not even mention TDR -that game belongs in the garbage.What I dislike about the game is that the orignal carmageddons had an atmosphere of seriousness with a bit of jokes mixed in. This game lacks that. It's all sillyness. The original atmosphere of the other carmageddon games is prescent in some levels, but even then it is shallow at best.The interface is absolute garbage.

As a kid, it was easy to get lost in such a diverse and action-packed game. Back then, racing games were stuck with linear tracks that left your mind wondering what lies beyond the asphalt. Carmageddon changed this by allowing you to explore large scapes and encouraging you to find secrets. The danage model in the originals were out of this world-- I remember playing Destruction Derby the same year, and although I enjoyed the game, it was nowhere near as advanced as Carmageddon.Many years later I decided to dive in head first and buy Carmageddon: Max Damage. I know it's not just a ""nostalgic"" thing for me-- At first I wondered if I made a mistake buying this. The controls were a bit wonky, the gameplay wasn't what I had remembered, the damage model felt cheap and I just didn't understand what I was doing. Surelly, I wasn't going to give up after the first few levels, though.Suddenly, I unlocked my first vehicle, and the next, and the next.. The controls weren't bad, I just hadn't unlocked and explored the other vehicle options and I still needed to upgrade. As soon as I got some heavier vehicles, I really started appreciating the damage model. My vehicle was so weak that I didn't have an opportunity to see the havok wreaked upon it's body before it blew up. The game all came together for me and I finally realized after 50 hours that I made a great choice.In the end, I definitely recommend this game if you're looking for something to get lost in for many many hours.

It felt kinda lame, and i even refunded the game. BUT, i started playing the original carmageddon on IOS (must have) and got back in that feel, that u wanna wreck cars and make artistic ped splay replays... anyways, i bought the max damage version again, and realized its not that bad..

I played them all and none of them quite captured the magic of the original for me.  This game however, has managed to mostly re-capture that magic.  I noticed that they even brought back the iconic music from fear factory that was part of what made the original such a great game.  I lso love how most of the levels seem to be modified versions from the original game, it brings back good memories and the level designs were excellent to start with.  exploration is still there too, which was a great thing about this game, lots of suprises.  Im not sure if i love the upgrade mechanic where you have to find coins, although I guess it does encourage exploration which can be a lot of fun.Some things I found missing is that feeling of speed that the original  had which this one doesn't quite re-create, maybe I just need some faster cars?another difference I noticed is that the eagle doesn't seem as potent as it was in the original.  I found you could race most of the way through the game with just the eagle and do just fine.  it wasn't until you unlocked the tow truck or other heavy hitters that you needed to switch.I would love if they would release an updated version of the splat pack and the associated levels and updated cars.  I loved the re-design of the eagle in that game.Another thing I miss is the picture of max in the corner of the screen, I loved how he would scream when you got going really fast and the way he would react to slamming into another car or running over a ped.  I know its a small thing but it was just another thing that made the original unique.  I also noticed that with the in-car view, there isn't a rear-view mirror.overall, if you liked the original, your gonna love this game.  it was an insta-buy for me!"

I would also like to point out that the hit detection needs to be fixed, sometimes if I get wrecked even the minor movement will destroy my car again completely. I.e.: I was racing and got wrecked, the enemies went away and I recovered my car but I had to flip it back, when I did my car was wrecked again FOR NO REASON, there was no one nearby.

,Recommended,505170,28407539,"Posted: 16 December, 2016",all,Nukkus,"In the year 1997, the feces hit the radiator fan. A racing game so vulgar, crass and violent was released that even the pope* lost his shiz. Carmageddon had arrived in full force, and the gaming world would never be the same. Contestants would strap themselves into motorized death machines, and try to smash the crap out of their opponents while flattening as many pedestrians as possible along the way. Reaching the finish line was optional. Back in the day all this gratuitous gore was shocking and memorable, but this day and age it doesn't carry quite so much in the shock factor department, though it's still a decent way to spend an afternoon.Thankfully the newest reincarnation of the franchise, Carmageddon Max Damage, has brought things forward into modern times. From the shiny chrome-plated graphics to the bone-crunching sound effects, they've provided the full package here. Also much improved is the game's control system, which quite frankly was an utter crapshow on the older PC games in the series. Everything that made the franchise fan-[CENSORED]-tastic has returned full force, and then some. The classic Carmageddon gameplay mode is here, where you can take the checkpoints, smash all your foes, or tediously hunt down each and every pedestrian to win (blah!).That's not to say everything is popping up smelling like roses. The load times in particular reek like bull puckey, sometimes taking several minutes to load up the carnage. The framerate tanked a few times on me as well, but with that much highly-detail gut-spewing destruction onscreen at once it's to be expected that the game engine might crap it's pants occasionally. But despite a couple of dingleberries in the mix, this hot mess still comes out on top. It's saving grace is the fact that on the market right now there's just nothing like it at all, and that fact makes it a gleaming polished turd bobbing in a sea of boring cookie-cutter sequelitis diarrhea. So go for it, blow your load (of cash) all over Carmageddon: Max Damage. Just make sure to wash your hands when you're done.*Greg Pope, MP"

I still actually own the original games complete in big boxes, manuals and cases.Upon learning there was a reboot, i quickly jumped on the Reincarnation train.Although i liked it, i couldn't love it since it was technically a BETA and it was incomplete.Then Max Damage comes along....I've only just started playing but heres a little rundown.The gameplay has that nostalgia feeling of the 90's hit which is exactly the way they should of approached it. It is after all a reboot (which is why they called the BETA Reincarnation).You get straight into the action without any story mode or lengthy cinematics, just like the original.The career mode is very simmilar to the original where you either win by completing the laps or ""wasting"" the other drivers. There are also stealable vehicles and laps.New game modes in the career keep the fun factor alive since you're not doing the same thing every race.Graphics are absolutely phenomenal.Controls are easy and i use an XBOX 360 controller which it has native support for.Sound could be a little louder but they are addressing that as we speak.Maps are nice, large and detailed.Powerups are plentiful and can give you the edge in tight situations.I havnt played the multiplayer yet, but i will update this post once i have.Overall, the game is EVERYTHING that it should be and more.I was originally excited about Reincarnation and i thought i liked it but i can comfortably say i love this game.What an absolute champion performance at recreating a legendary old school DOS/Windows game."

First time i play first game was in year 1999. I was just 14 years old and this instantly. became one of my favorites game in that time. Graphic, physics, gore and fun was outstanding in this game. I liked it even more, because i played it secretly, when parents were gone, because it was forbidden game for me :). Later i played all other Carmaggeddon games. I even modded Carmaggedon 2 an made some cars for it, when i was about 15 years old.It was pitty, that no Carmageddon game came out later, even when games like GTA substituted pedestrian slaghtering, it was not that good in this. When i first learned, that remake is preapared and alpha of Carmageddon: Reincarnation is available, i bought it instantly.Alpha has been so much bugy, it was not even playable. Loading time of map was about 2-3 minutes. I was disappointed and didn't play game of a while. Later i bought GTX1060 and i gave it a second chance. In that time was the game fixed and more playable. I make progress in my career up to 90%, and then i found that Carmageddon: Max Damage was released. Yeah, pitty that all my progress goes to waste, but what ever i began from beginning in Max Damage.Max Damage was noticably better optimised, faster, with better enhanced graphic. It's not a top notch, but still it's nice. Career mode is really challenging. Every item and upgrade must be earned. Wrecking of oponents and destruction model is pretty komplex and smashing of the oponents in replay mode looks great. Hurting peds is all the way fun as in the first game in series. It's even more fun with tons of power-ups, you can tear legs from ped, you can burn them down, you can levitate them up to the air and drop them down. Speaking of replay mode, you can have lots of fun from watching nasty smashes to the pedestrians or oponents.Downside is clunky control of some vehicles. I know, some cars are weird by it self, but controls could be at least predictible. Another downside is that there are no players online, it could be fun. Last thing are few glitches, that still stays there, but nothing critical.In general, this game is successful successor and remake of Carmageddon 1. It's fun casual play, when you want to clear your head and just play something fun.Pros-it's Carmageddon-fun to play-fast action-lots of blood-lots of destruction-lots of powerups-replay modeCons-not a top notch graphic-clunky controls-sometimes glitches-no players online"

I'm loving this way more than I should, car physics can bug out sometimes, keyboard controls aren't quite as crispy as they were in Carmageddon 2, but it's still fun and with controller it gets even better.I was actually fine with reincarnation after the last few patches that brought performance to the level I could play it with my R9-290X with steady 50-60fps 1080p, but after getting this superior version (witch actually runs steady 60fps with that same R9 @ 1600p) for free I've pretty much forgiven Stainless for the mess reincarnation was on launch, tough I'm still not going to kickstart or preorder their games ;)"

It was chalked full of bugs and performance issues that completely removed all enjoyment. I could not ever get the game to perform to a level of playability that was tolerable even though my system had more than met the system requirements. So I got a refund and never looked back. That is until I heard about Carmageddon: Max Damage. I wanted so badly for it to be the game I wanted. I read about some of the new changes. Mostly performance related but some new maps, cars and the addition of an old function of the original games, Car splitting!  Yes!! So I decided to give it another shot, this game has not let me down.Thought to myself 'I wonder if the car spliting function is the same as it was in Carmagedon 2?' and then I got split right in half and kept driving! I found out it is just like the original but more fun. Then I also found out you can respawn and I continued with my revenge. The taste is so sweet!The game performs the way one would expect when they want to actually play a video game. Very smooth, no stuttering or crashes so far. I'm happy with this product.9/10 Graphics10/10 Audio10/10 Fun factor?/10 Mulitplayer (Haven't yet tried it)Excellent capture of the feeling from the original first 2 games in the series while updating it enough to make it more enjoyable. If you tried Carmageddon 1 or 2 and liked them then definitely give this a shot. It will most certainly bring back fond memories while allowing you make new ones. If you have not tried any of the games in the series but always wanted to drive over that irritating pedestrian or take out your road rage on somebody with out going to jail then this game is for you!"

Excellent and so far the best looking title in the series, but pales in comparison to the originality Carmageddon 2 brought.PS3 controller support is strange, Xbox controller support is good.Frequent crashing to desktop and high PC requirements can put off inexpensive gaming rigs.8/10 Because glitches and controller support issues.Edit made to include controller portions of review."

The opponents are racing and fighting all over the place. Depending on the way you play races can be over in about 2 mintues or take more than 30 minutes.There are several distinct game modes, a ton of different levels and even more vehicles of which each has a unique feel. In my opinion the handling of the vehicles is fine but don't expect a racing game type of grip and be prepared to get used to the different cars. The vehicles need to be stolen during races and their capabilities upgraded (via a very simple system). Upgrading requires the collection of upgrade tokens which are scattered throughout the maps. New stages are unlocked once enough points are obtained. The varied powerups and funny puns make completing the stages a great and very addicting experience.Now that the performance and graphical issues are finally addressed I can only name a few minor gripes: the camera can sometimes be annoying, depending on the game mode and the stage the AI can be a little bit too stupid (sometimes it is very easy to win Fox and Hounds) and the menu interface help stuff sometimes gets in the way (why does it need to repeatedly show me new stages resulting in me starting the wrong race with the wrong and underpowered car?). An ETA for the Linux and Mac versions would also be nice.Considering its price this game is a steal. Since it is part of gaming history and the numerous educational purposes I will use my government ties to make the game part of the elementary school curriculum.9/10 would buy and wait for the improved version again."

It had problems but the game was still freakin awesome.  This one is better in some areas and in other areas not so much better.  First and foremost the game seems a little more snappier.  Where as the previous would take about 1 min to load a game, this one takes about 45secs.  The cars seem a little better to handle here.  I will say however that the graphics don't seem as good.  The cars don't look as nice.  There is a wider variety of peds which is fantastic.  The AI seems toned down.  Maybe that was because I was playing on normal and not hard.  When I hit a car it gets stars around its top hood to I guess make it show that you disoriented the driver but that is just weird and makes them too easy to blow up.  Also, before you start the game, if you put yourself in the beginning and then speed ahead and then stop you can cause a huge traffic jam of disoriented cars.  You can win a game pretty quickly.I do like it.  I haven't played much yet, and I will update my review once I have played more."

So if you are confused with buying this or Reincarnation, buy this one because Reincarnation is the older (or the unfinished) version of this game, which is the same but less maps and vehicles. I got this game with Reincarnation, because the ones who bought Reincarnation before Max Damage was released, was considered as a Kickstarter Supporter (as far as I know) and they gave it for free.First of all, this game is a game that has a lot of blood and gore. And because of that you might want to stay away from it if you are disturbed with those things, but a lot of fun if you aren't. Secondly, I'm a guy that is into cars and racing, and the game is a must if you want to combine crashing with beautiful graphics and gore. Lastly, the game should be considered more like a singleplayer game, because multiplayer is not that populated and because of that you might not be able to get the skins or the rims for the cars that unlock by doing specific things or winning races in multiplayer. My advice would be buying the game only if you are into it so much or if you don't have anything better to spend your money on."

Carma has always had some sort of tongue in cheek humor but this is just pathetic.Cars look very toylike.Remember how annoying missions were in Carma 2? Now they don't have missions per se, they have special races that are as annoying as missions and are a chore to do.Take the Fox and hounds ""race"" as the worst example. Most of the time is easy because the AI is not coded to run away when they are the Fox. They will just try to ram you. But in small maps where you can't easily blast away to the other side of the map, every single car will focus on you and keep you from getting the Fox. The AI is not even playing the game, they are just ganging up and trolling you, specifically. They tend do this in all races, regardless what the winning conditions are.There are other idiotic races like this one. This is not what Carma is about.The game is a typical example of some old farts thinking that just because their games were good back in the day they can have the same success again. The game is supposed to be a stress relief yet it's actually more stressful due to these dumb winning conditions. Just let me ********ing wreck cars and run over peds.Carma 1 or 2 had a few pointless ""power-ups"". This one has even more. They don't do anything except delay the game. Some of them are insta-death. Oh here, you get to die now. Luckily you can still play and don't lose the race, but why? Why is this in the game?If you are a Carma fan just install Carma 2 or 1.

I remember playing the original carmageddon games and I remember the control wasn't great, but this isn't 1998... It's 2016 and a car game that is frustratingly, no ridiculously obnoxious to control is not worth a penny. I am disappointed unfortunately.The most frustrating thing about the controls is the overcorrecting. The creators attempted to create a relatively realistic driving experience, except for the low gravity and the bit of auto steer. When you are drifting/sliding or making slight turns the game automatically countersteers/corrects just enough to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off when you stop turning. That means that if you try to countersteer you end up over correcting. it is not intuitive. If you are going around a turn and need to tap the stick when you let go of that stick the car wags itself making you think you need to correct and it ends up in a cycle that only gets worse until you spin out... The problem is when the car starts to wag itself you can't quite tell which direction you will be going once it's finished wagging.DEVS: PLEASE REMOVE THIS BIT OF AUTOSTEER! It would be FAR easier to control if i KNEW what the car was going to do... IE- If the car did ONLY what I TOLD IT TO DO...---an update after completing the campaign... the game does get better once you get more cars and upgrade them.-Multiplayer is empty-single player campaign is fun for a while-I would only recommend this game for nostalgia (for those of us who played the original carma games)-I would not recommend this game for people who are looking for a ""racing game"" or a combat RACING game...

It definitely appears like it graphically and the sound effects are superb. But where it is let down massively is the gameplay. This version is just a frustrating mess. The AI is a cheat. There is always some other car ready to smash into you forcing you to play a certain way. The checkpoints are all poorly executed capture the flag crap. A lot of the game ends up being just frustrating, not able to formulate any strategies or play the way you wish. As soon as you near a targetted ped there is another car there appearing as if by magic to get there first. Don't get me wrong. I'm not rubbish at this game, I win rounds but when I win them I still feel utterly frustrated by it all. I don't feel any sense of achievement or enjoyment from it like I did C2.Why in the world would the devs not include the Carmageddon 2's format? Just attach it and call it classic mode? What a complete waste this game is. It could have been amazing. But still after all this time they haven't addressed it. Are they so far up their own backsides that they think the original's format is inferior? Why mess with something that was perfect. Everytime I play this I try to like it but it ends up leaving a frustrating bad taste in the mouth.This game simply isn't playable for any length of time in my opinion. If you've never played Carmageddon 2 then you'd probably think I'm talking nonsense and I'd understand that.If they added a C2 mode and added an AI similar to it then I'd be playing this a great deal. As it stands, I doubt I'll play this much at all. I'm close to completely giving up with this game as I'm now realising the best version will always remain C2 with it's outdated graphics.

I know car games don't usually have much in the way of story, but these are just a collection of races back to back. I played a couple of the earlier carmaggeddon games and felt an enjoyable level of progression, however I didnt feel it here.The driving itself is, as many have described, like mario cart. It's not all that bad, but its really heavy. You turn right and the car will swing right. It reminds me a lot of the driving in Arma. It does make sense to some extent due to the cars increased weight, with all the armour etc attached, but every turn results in some form of powerslide. Feathering the wheel with corrections isn't really a thing here.You unlock upgrades as races go on and upgrade choices. The problem with this is that they funnel you down a path that gives you the illusion of choice, except... well you only have one choice. The upgrades are also as mundane as it gets. Fill this bar up here and there, for increased performance in that area. After researching this it doesnt appear that much in the way of visual effects take place.The multiplayer at this point in time is sadly in a worse off place. The user interface doesnt tell you much of anything bar how many people are in each game. When trying to join a game you will be met with ""can't join because game is in session"" error messages. The problem with this is that theres no way to tell when they are in the lobby waiting and games  can take up to 30+ mins a piece. Alternatively I tried to host a game, and was met with a network error message over and over again. I tried testing a couple of other games out at the time to see if it was the connection and they all worked fine. Maybe a select port blockage, but I'm not spending my time trying to find out which ones.The next problem was the lack of people understably playing the game. Each time I looked there were 4 - 5 games, none of which I could join after attempting to for 10 or so minutes.After all of this I went directly to steams help > refund request function and got my money back.Don't get me wrong, theres plenty of potential here, but I doubt it will every be properly realised."

I vaguely remember playing the really old ones when I was a kid, and looking back at videos/screenshots of it, it doesn't seem that great. Any newer attempt at a Carmageddon game just seems... weak.The idea behind these games are good, but they are always executed so badly. The handling of cars in this game is absolutely AWFUL. They don't feel even remotely driveable. Honestly, it feels like there are a lot of other companies that could make this game much better.Bugbear for example would be able to do wonders if they made a game like Flatout: Ultimate Carnage, and then added all the Carmageddon parts into it.The tracks in this game are awfully designed, the environments suck and just feel like everything has been plastered anywhere they felt like. I get that a city would have people in it, but a person just standing in the middle of the street is stupid. Cows and penguins walking around those city streets? Even more stupid.This game really would work so much better if they toned down all the gimics and tried to make a race that was actually like a death race. A massive A to B race with multiple routes, WAAAAAY more cars (seriously? 6?), had multiple people in places that seemed logical and mostly FIX THE HANDLING!Don't recommend for now. This feels too half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥That said, I am still going to continue playing as frankly I'm not one to give up on a game.EDIT: After playing more, I recommend this game even less. AI is AWFUL! They will get practically attached to you, constantly ramming you and ignoring everything else. Won't back up, won't give you any space to get away. They just constantly try and push you around and it complete stops you doing anything unless you waste points doing a reset.Also the game won't re-pick up Xbox 360 controls once it loses them for whatever reason. If you have to alt-tab to desktop (full screened or windowed mode) and then you return using the mouse, it will change the control type to mouse/keyboard and can't get the controller controls back.Lastly, the game keeps crashing every 30 mintues or so. Very badly done. REALLY don't recommend.Lastly, at time of writing this, the game advertises trading cards but actually DOES NOT have any."

Graphics looks dongraded comparing to reincarnation, textures looks super low-res, like some PS2, cockpit view is so lazy and laugtable, especially whe you look at low poly arm of Max and Anna, and see that it has not indicators on pannels not even speedometer or something else that OLD CARMA 1 had. Also there is no fov option fo cockpit and default is not optimal. Gamme screwed up and reversed, all colors washed out and super grey.Steering controls very unresponsive and slow, while camera super fast and wonky, game lacking basic contol binds that allow to switch camera on fly or look behind you (im talking about gamepad), yet buttons wasted on some unnecessary features.Powerup binding menu is super slow because instead of allowing to set things quickly, they force us to look 2 seconds of fancy animation per each step. Devs still dont get that dpad has 8 direction and allows to bind 8 items instead of 4, and that there is even possible to bind 2x more by using double taps or scroling of same direction.Addition of cockpit, optimisation and few new cars and animals is the only thing about it, rest seem lazy or downgraded comparing to reincarnation.Core of game is fun, but dissapointmen runs the fun.Also devs still dont realise that people dislike new music and want to bring old carmagedon tracks in ogg or mp3 format into the game. Is it so freaking hard to add ""custom music"" optoon that will bring all tracks into game from some custom folder, without going into modding that will disable achievments and mulitplayer?Speaking of music, i just realised that a lot of settings from reincarnation vanished from this version, such as option which allowed to enable\disable each track and customize preferable soundtrack. I had to replay reincarnation to see what else is gone and downgraded.Will change review to positive if devs will bring back everything they lost in this release and will make textures great again and put some effort intoc cockpit view to make it look no like lazy PS2 game, with low poly hands on low poly wheel and low res blocky window texture in front of your face and will add some pannels to it and will fix gamma issues and add custom music support."

Welcome to the least politically correct driving game around, probably.Short version: If you're looking for a racing game with few rules, many blood stains, low-brow comedy and unplanned comedy, you probably want to give this a go.Good enough graphics & sound, varied selection of cars to get (with some cool new ones to go along the classics that have always been there), tight controls (highly depending on the vehicle you drive, some aren't designed to be controllable), and more than enough people and livestock to run over for bonus points.Also, a bunch of different game modes for variety, a reason to explore the maps (that's now  how you get the tokens you need for vehicle upgades),TL;DR wall of text version:First, there was Carmageddon. A fun little racing game where you get to roam a wide map to pick your own shortest route to the checkpoints, thus completing laps to win the race. Or, you know, you could just total your opponents instead and be the last one standing. That works too. Oh. And beware of the pedestrians along the track. They're worth points if you make them go SPLAT! and you'll need those points to pay for repairs & stuff. As added bonus, splatting the last ped on the map is another way to be declared winner.For some reason, that ""More pedestrians equals more points!"" bit caused a bit of controversy as well.Then came Carmageddon 2. Which was technically superior to the first in many ways, and was every bit as nuts. It also introduced some godawful timed & scripted missions to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off until they track down the cheat codes to skip those. Hum. I suppose that's the risk of trying to innovate, sometimes what sounds like a good idea doesn't really work out in the end.Next up, Carmageddon TDR2000. Which introduces crazier vehicles (yay!), messes up the driving physics (boo!) and has pretty much every stage be a timed & scripted mission, thus repeating Carma 2's big mistake several times over (WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS? ARGH!). Suffice to say, this is the black sheep of the series. And that came out back in 2000, after which the series pretty much died.Until about 15 years later, when the aptly-subtitled Carmageddon: Reincarnation brought things back to life. (That's not counting a fairly troubled Early Access period; the early builds were in all honesty complete♥♥♥♥♥♥in terms of performance and general feel, and the game wasn't really playable until a massive overhaul shortly before release sorted out the biggest issues)The official release version was still rough, but playable and enjoyable enough to bring back the happy days of driving like a maniac and unleashing the Pedestrian Electro-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ray on unsuspecting crowds. All in all, not stellar, but it did prove the general idea is still valid in this day and age.It got a bunch of updates along the way, and then promptly disappeared from the digital stores where it was sold.That's because for console release, there was this updated version titled ""Carmageddon: Max Damage"". With more spit & polish and stuff. So the devs decided that should replace Reincarnation on Steam as well.With all the work put into it by now, this really is a worthy successor to 1 & 2, and it's a perfect game to just pick up & play for some relaxing mindless violence."

Nice and weighty at high speed, yet still responsive and grippy at low speed. It's just what you want with a driving game using a keyboard or controller. Fair few AAA games get this so wrong (watchdogs, just cause). Having a lot of fun so far. Already recommended to a friend actually."

,Recommended,505170,28912775,Posted: 1 January,all,Monchberter,"The Kickstarted release of Carmageddon: Reincarnation was a huge let down that meant that I coiuldn't even play the game on release. I was so disappointed, given the artwork and hints dropped on the way up to release by the Stainless team.I'd quietly forgotten about Carma, only to find in my Steam library a copy of something called 'Max Damage'. So I fired it up with minimal hopes.Within 2 mins I had a huge grin on my face, this was finally the game that delivers on the promise of Reincarnation. Playing like a cocktail of Carma 1 and 2, this is finally the legacy game that fans have been hoping for. Well done Nobby and the team! You've won an OG Carma fan back."

Same heavy handling, same crude humour, same silly collection of vehicles and power-ups... and that's just fine.It also has a launch option to replace all the pedestrians with Trump clones that spray orange blood when crushed under your wheels - strangely relaxing."

If you liked Carmageddon 1 & 2, you will love this, it is a VERY good and fun remake. There is very little new stuff in this game compared to previous games, but what is there is well done. Biggest drawback of the game for me is the AI, which feels overtly aggressive towards the player while ignoring other AIs, cops also only attack the player. Still, there is lots of fun and carnage for you to enjoy."

Very very close to chapter 1, I'll still play both of them.Only thing I don't like much in this one is how fast the camera is moving around the car in contrast with the first carma: when I'm playing destruction-derby-like it's pretty fast and disorientating at times. Minor flaw anyway and I still didn't watch in the options tbh."
