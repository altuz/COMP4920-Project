,Not Recommended,505210,25502303,"Posted: 14 September, 2016",all,SupremeS,"Oh god why do I keep buying these games.Here's the basic premise of Neon Space 2 - fly a spaceship through a bunch of narrow and twisty paths, and avoid the many death traps that lie in wait in the process. As a premise, that's fine - but after only a few minutes getting used to the controls, you can already see the whole game falling apart around you. They're just not precise - tapping a button can send your ship forward a tiny jolt or a massive lurch purely based on the mood the game is in, and turning feels floaty, surreal and just plain not fun at all. Then you realise the collision detection is similarly awful - your ship can explode randomly while being a notable distance away from any nearby obstacle whatsoever, and it's impossible to distinguish the point where you should actually be staying away from anything that could create a critical existence failure.Difficulty is schizophrenic to the extreme as well. One early level is full of fast moving laser grids, requiring precise navigation and timing up until the very end. Another level just a bit later on is... A basic maze with no obstacles whatsoever. It's perplexing to observe, but no matter what a level contains, there's never really a sense of satisfaction that comes from beating any of them. It's more of a grim muttering of ""finally..."" and a slow sense of dread about what's coming next.Good points? Well, your ship's two abilities (Blink, which teleports you forward and through some obstacles, and slow time, which... Slows time) can occasionally be fun. Use them well while not being screwed over by the other game mechanics, and for a brief moment you feel like you're in control of the Matrix. The music's good as well - a quick glimpse of the credits shows it's all creative commons stuff, but there’s a nice mix of stuff which is nice to listen to and follows a good sci-fi theme, so fair play there.Still, though, Neon Space 2 just... Isn't fun. There are tons of games like this, which do everything slightly better at the very least. Half of them are free online. Go and play them instead."

The music is amazing, however I tried to find some of the music from their list and that list is all sorts of unorganized. There are songs under the wrong author, there is no way to sample the songs or set your own playlist either. Also the controls for the mouse are pretty terrible as the cursor will vanish if you aren't using it. Finally the music stops every time you die, any time you are paused, and in between levels. If they fixed these issues with an immediate respawn or continuous music this game would easily be worth 5 times what it is now. I reccomend this game if you can get past those small issues because the music is pretty amazing and it is a fun little time consumer.Also just a side note all of the music was taken from Creative Commons, a list of songs for anyone to access to edit. If anyone cared that is also a thing..."

,Recommended,505210,29615096,Posted: 31 January,all,dnlgjmnz,"I absolutely recommend this game, especially for the price. I got it for 66% off after crafting a badge. This game is addictive, fun, the music is great, and you have the ability to skip tracks.. go back.. pause. It's great!! This is the perfect game to get lost in. Just old fashioned challenges. No story, no silly gimmicks. There are two moves, one is called a bump that kind of teleports you a few inches away, and the other slows down time slightly. The challenge is choosing when to use the abilities as they have recharge times. This game is great to get high and play, it's got perfect pick up and play value as well as having fun trying to beat level times. Seriously for $1 you can't beat this."

You still feel like a lab rat, but in whole new mazes.Gameplay is simple just like the first, and yes you can still use the mouse to control the direction, and the keys to move.Graphics are very much the same as well. Simple, minimal, bright, and colorful.Good soundtrack accompanies the game as well.Another fun, simple, and addictive game for you, for an incredibly low price.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O92ktsa7XHI&list=PLGCO4EfbVB6XXoAnQMUJjoEh3c2BLfHx8&index=74"

I'll put my review of this game and will safely say not to get this game for many of reasons and why the negatives outweigh the positives. But if you have no problem wasting a dollar or when it goes on sale, for a few cents, then go ahead and buy this game you might like it.PositivesMost of the levels were well made in the beginning and not too hard for new players to understand.Music was very nice and fitting for this type of game but I can't speak for everyone. But most of the time I actually turned off stuff I was listing to in the background to listen to music in the game.Can get a good looking game with nice FPS early in the game.Sometimes it's the good kind of challenging in the game for people who want some challenge.NegativesMain menu can get annoying for people who are just beginning.When starting you get no idea to what position from where you are starting. Except exiting back to the main menu and looking at the picture of the level where you were last on.Game doesn't tell you what time to get after you have finshed the level or going to the main menu and see what time you should've gotten for whatever medal you wanted.Some levels were just annoying and when spawning later on in the game, if you weren't careful you would die upon spawing.There was not a tutorial to help new players but this could be seen on the controls.You get the special abilities on level 3 but the game doesn't tell you that you had gotten them so some players can try to go thoughout this game without the knowledge of the abilities.Levels will get very hard later on but these levels are far more annoying than fun.The character can get very hard for both the beginning and later on.ConclusionEarly on this game is very fun but later on this can be a quick turn from a good experience to a horrible experience. This game can also be very buggy which the devs seem to be fixing after hearing some of them so that's why there was no bugs in the negative spot. Really there is no replay value and if you are really good at this gmaes it could take you 4-6 hours or if you're bad most likely 7-9 hours. This game really doesn't hurt your wallet unless you want small fries from MacDonalds to feed your starving self so buy it and help the devs to make better games than this one and make a new creative ideas and help make better games.Game Score: 4/10 Below Average"

76561198131701503,Recommended,505210,34572267,Posted: 29 August,all,anotherphysicsgradstudent,"Neon Space 2is a nice little inexpensive puzzler.  The core mechanic relies on understanding momentum to navigate mazes and avoid obstacles, but there are a few special powers which keep things interesting.  Each level is short, which makes this ideal for something to occupy a few spare minutes.  There are a couple of minor issues with the game; most notably, the difficulty curve is all over the place, with hard levels followed by strings of easy ones and vice versa.  Also, the music won't be to everyone's taste.  Still, for the price I think it offers decent value."
