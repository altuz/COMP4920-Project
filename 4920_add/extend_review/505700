,Recommended,505700,28113471,"Posted: 30 November, 2016",all,gooboberti,"I have been sleeping in Virtual Reality for the past 4 days...Seriously.I do other things, of course- but when all is done- I find my time re-creating my room from reality- importing it bit by bit into the alternate world created by my own digital hands.This is amazing- this program ""Anyland"" coupled with room-scale virtual reality- allows for a user to create forms with function- to easily animate them or treat them like solid objects for other people to walk on.At this moment I have my entire living area mapped out and brought into VR. I just finished my desk in the back, changed the walls into a nice metal/glass combo, made monitors and my computer, created a nice table with measurements built in- equal to reality.How I map my room into VR:I stand there in the digital void, and feel an object in front of me with my physical hands- I then create a digital object to serve as a glowing pin suspended in the air and pin this to each corner of the physical object- in VR. Once I have the measurements, I quickly create a large rough polygon with my digital hands, resizing quickly to fill out the shape. I set the color and then decide if I want any additional functionality.For most furniture items I set no further options, as I do not want other users entering my universe to start flipping the desk for fun.For most other items, I set options to make the object ""holdable"". This will create a copy of the object in the user's hand 6 they attempt to ""grab"" the digital item.I can easily add an animation to an object-but think of this- when you animate an item in Virtual Reality, and are standing there amongst objects of your creation, the animated object feels very ""real"".The process of animation is very easy-Example of animating the blink of an eyelid:Select eyelid objectOnce selected, a screen will appear, showing ""1"",""2""These are the key frames in the action listBy default they are empty, but you can click on ""2"", move the item, click back on ""1"" and see the item jump back and forth/ only doing so when you click the buttons marked ""1"", and ""2""But if we wanted to make the thing animate on its own, we click on ""1"" and select the commands that pop up in this order:When starts then become next in 1sIt's easy.You then click on 2, and under the command list, the bottom option will be the last used command- like a shortcut for your history.When starts then become next in 1sNext for the last position cycles back- so this animation will cycle between frame 1 and frame 2, every 1s- forever.Now imagine that instead of it just cycling, it waited for a command-Anyland allows for many triggers:When:TouchedConsumedHeldThrownNearbyTouched byEtcSo, if we wanted a shining red crystal floating in the air in front of us to activate a door that opens vertically upon a touch- the process is very easy and very awesomeBest way to describe this is-Ready player oneOr your dreams come true.You could sit there and recreate the entire movie of Jurassic park to become an interactive virtual reality experience if you just took the time. You could create full sized animated raptors, full sized animated t-Rex stepping on a full sized jeep, next to a full sized moat-cliff, near full sized giant trees, near full sized giant brachiosaurus that were animated eating leaves.Understand that this is not like a ""video game""This is virtual reality..And I really have been sleeping in VR.I pull up a nice documentary on my virtual television and slip on my virtual sleeping bag- animated to expand and contract with each breath.Funny thing is people still show up in my virtual room even when I'm sleeping. They stand over me and watch me. Some even put something relaxing on the television for me.https://youtu.be/DeSJBN2nqaYLink to playlist of 3 videos by Gooboberti on Anyland:https://youtu.be/ssODNmA-wUY?list=PL1ejlqbXsHawWiHXgkbQ_XpuQz6aQb2Ay"

That's the best way to put this into words.I have been building and creating content in SecondLife and other programs for 12 years or so.This is sl in vr , without the land costs ,, limited space and the deadly need to make money on everything you do.  And everything made is made within the game so the playing field is leveled,, the endless amount of space is sitting there waiting.Many base shapeslots of colors, textures ( and that's 2 texture layers and a color /material,. layer.The easiest scripting language ever created. (seriously if you can read you can script)Space , Free ,, as much as you need as much as you want ,, you don't get limited by having to Buy or rent space.Community is mostly adult  and friendly , with the random teen tossed in to keep things interesting and to remind you this IS the internet.By far the thing i  load up most on the vive.I had a small bit of trouble at first figuring out the tools but ,, im new to VR.Its   a wide open playground with really good people in it.Come in, make something.

My first session was over 4 hours, I could just not put it down. Throughout creating my own little world, people kept stopping by and sharing creations, swapping tips and tricks, and exploring together. I'm looking forward to updates, but this is already so much fun in it's current state."
,Recommended,505700,29976005,Posted: 16 February,all,"David ""TheDave"" Eastwick","Anyland -Build and animate whatever you want in vr and share it with friends!If you are old like me (38years young) i'm sure you have played with lego, if you are a little younger then you may of also played with many of the spin offs that allowed you to add motors to your creations (or played minecraft, the awesome lego of today), the youth have no idea how good the toys are they have access to these days lol,Anyland is like lego in vr (without the pointy bits that you find with your feet in the middle of the night) you can make almost anything your mind can think off…. If you stick with it! What is more you can animate the items with scripts. The thing that will keep you coming back to the game is the community though, they never cease to amaze me, but more about them further down.So how complex can you get? Well here is a couple of examples, a player showed me a button on his wrist, when pressed glowing wings unfolded from his body, a body he fully made in anyland! Yesterday when playing around with my space (of which you can have a seemingly unlimited supply of should you wish it) some players popped in and showed me a lot of devices, from a gun that fires small needless that actually have an injection animation when they hit you and can then teleport you, to a gun that fired giant cheese puffs that start small and then slowly engulf you.You can also put anything you see into your inventory, don't worry about your kleptomaniac impulses upsetting people, it makes a copy, the original item remains :) and you have 100 pages to utilise so you will not run out of space anytime soon, These items can then be placed in your own areas (and when you look at the description you can see how many times it is placed and its author, a great way to see how popular your item is)Another very important thing to note, the developer clearly cares deeply for the game and his community, many updates and bug fixes, this is no money grabbing shovelware game.ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENTThe roomscale is pretty perfect for this, once you get the hang of the commands you will be teleporting about and creating items left right and center, at no point did i feel restricted by the roomscale mechanics and you are even able to rotate your self via buttons should you need to, i have also played via the lazy method…. Sitting on my sofa. Now the environments, ok heres where this one is a little hard to review, The environments are all made by the players, so my area since im a noob is very bland, blocked shapes, but then you get some areas that are just breathtaking, some people have spent some serious time and effort to make some truly wonderful areas. It is a game that is almost as much fun to simply explore as it is to create!GRAPHICSMost things are basic shapes, but with these basic shapes you can build anything, you can also colour them, turn them to metal, to a video screen for youtube, to fluid, to glass. There are both area lights with real time lighting to spotlights that have full lighting and shadows, so again graphics are tricky to nail down….this is no witcher 3 but it is also better then minecraft if you put the time in to make your area awesome…. Overall i would say that it is a great graphic style for this game.PERFORMANCENow mostly the game runs great, i have visited areas with thousands of objects and been unaffected, i have also had my fair share of crashes, a testament to the game though is that when i have crashed i have simply loaded up the game straight away. I have seen objects that will bug out players, and currently a door i made has glitched and has a nasty habit of following players around, i have had some fellow players threaten to make a “Dave’s Door” meme...gulp… but it is early access, a phrase that does make us groan i know and often used to cover a multitude of sins but here it is true, the developer can be seen to clearly be fixing bugs and adding content, in fact since i bought the game i do not think i have seen a single day without a patch (Philip the dev seems to be a one man machine and i truly wonder if he actually sleeps and eats or just codes non stop, there is a reason my fellow players love him so much that there is even a “Church of Philip” (an institution i think i may be banned from for excessive punning)So in short not the smoothest vr game i have ever played but by no means too buggy (and when it is running ok...which is the majority of time… it is perfectly fine)INTUITIVENESSOk here for me is where it fails, my first experiences with the game had me so frustrated i rage quited (an absolute rarity for me) and almost refunded the game, however there is an amazing community in this game and they helped me on the forums and then helped me in game, within a few hours of getting help i was creating animated doors (not the Dave stalker door) with multiple sections and even made myself a head that has an animate mouth which opens and closes as i talk. And just yesterday i made a slot in my body open up like a tray and have a torch dropped into it that other players can use.So let us say it is not intuitive to begin with and has a learning curve that can be got over fast with the help of its community.MULTIPLAYER:Oh man, this is where the game shines, the community in this game, as i have said multiple times now, are awesome. Never have i felt so welcomed in a game then in this one, from people stopping by and complementing my animations on my door and showing me little tips and tricks to impromptu parties…. Yesterday i was working in my secret lab (that is open to the public) when a couple of players popped in, with in minutes we were laughing and seeing the cool things they found and made...a few minutes later more people turned up , we were all talking, laughing and before i knew it time had slipped away and it was 7am and i decided i needed to sleep,(i got woken up at 10am by a neighbour who demanded i keep it down in future….seems i was having so much fun laughing and chatting that i woke him up … oops, but it shows what i mean by how fun this community is.PROS:Awesome community.Very active dev.Your avatar is made by you (or for you) and as such can be unique.Your imagination really is the limit of what you can build.A super simple yet really powerful scripting and animation system.The community that is so good it really has to be said twice.Exploring other peoples worlds is amazing, the details some put into them,  and the stuff they make is just awe inspiring.CONS:Steep learning curve to start off with if you do not talk to others.Some bugs can be a bit annoying.Putting on your body (specially the torso) is very tricky to get right.No undo button (though you can undo a deletion)VERDICTIf you are not a complete solo only gamer and enjoyed lego this is a must have.If you love minecraft for the creative side, then you need this game.You will totally get your money's worth from this.Also did i mention, the community is very good?Yep it has my seal of approval (no actual seals were harmed in the making of this approval)"
76561197983030739,Recommended,505700,25886399,"Posted: 6 October, 2016",all,JoOngle,"Anyland is addictive to say the least.But it only becomes addictive with friends joining up, by friends I mean people like YOU and people joining up to play Anyland together.The good and the bad:You don´t need to have any 3D modeling experience to play in Anyland, once you get a grip on the controllers and their many functions, you´ll be building tons of stuff in minutes - yes minutes - because it doesn´t take long to build stuff, in fact you only use so called mesh primitives to build your houses, games, characters, avatars, chat areas, figures, cars, guns, signs, mountains and whatever you have on your mind to build.It may look simplistic at first, but once you realize you can build endless things and combine them into new tings - and do this live with friends watching and building together with you while you mess around, tell a few jokes or so, things soon become hilarious as you laugh at each others avatars and creations. Don´t expect this to be a professional modeling tool, it is NOT a modeling tool. It´s kind of like super-primitive version of Blender and Sketchup that meets Rec-Room + Bigscreen Beta playback (youtube etc.) if you couldn´t modify the models - but with chat added, multiplayer and the possibility to script your own games with those items you created combining primitive objects together.If you know the gamewww.manyland.com, then technically this is a 3D version of that game, but more or less in the beginning stages of its evolution. Expect this game to become at least as polished as Manyland is when the time comes, and also remember - YOU are a part of building the worlds in here, thats half the fun - the rest of the fun is meeting everyone!This is an early quickly done review since it´s brand new and just released, I will add another or expand on this one later on. See you in Anyland!**Update**This game is so addictive I may never leave for real life again. Real life is overrated anyway."

It's still a little early in development and you have to figure things out a bit, but there is tons of functionality already. The worst part is that there are not many people playing, so buy the damn game and play it! Every time I've gone into someone's place and there are a few people, it's extremely surreal seeing all these 100% custom avatars talking and socializing in a 100% user created area that actually looks great. You really feel like you are in some bizarre alternate reality."

I have not played any other game but this for the past week because it is so addicting. The social aspect is also amazing, being able to hang out and just build what ever is on your mind with other people. Everyone is very friendly and I love the community. Phillip, a developer, is also very active and is always willing to listen to your suggestion. You're missing out on a lot if you have not tried this game yet.

I quickly figure out how to touch things like my super rings, and bring myself to another area that had a (1) on it. I assumed it meant there was a person there...I assumed right.After a few minutes talking to the guy in there (Who was really patient and helpful), I was putting a face in my face hole, a body in my body hole, and other parts of my body to make up my whole.These parts were initially provided to me from the guy who was in that area with me, and as thankful as I was, as I started to figure out more about how to make shapes and object, my true persona began to materialize in my head.I knew what I wanted to be, and nothing could stop me from becoming my destined being.I quietly used my super ring to transport myself to my own world, a world that created itself upon my first starting the game.Here, I quickly got to work making myself a head, some arms, and a rather cool body.After sticking them all together, and seeing myself in the mirror, I knew I was complete.Finally, my dream of becoming a mantis was reached.The thing with this game is, it's just so fantastic. This is to VR what Minecraft is to PC.You get into the game, fiddle around with things, and before you know it, you're creating worlds and objects, alone or with anyone else playing the game at the same time.It really is an amazing experience.Anyone who owns the Vive, NEEDS this game."

,Recommended,505700,29007641,Posted: 4 January,all,♥Swirla♥,"Honestly one of the best VR expierences I've had to date!So much in here is possible and it's not difficult to get started, it has a very simple art style that is honestly versitile enough for beautiful, cute or detailed creations, I personally don't think the trailer does this much justice but detailed creations can really look nice!The scripting is so simple! Yet powerful, it can recognice simple and also surprising interactions (You can set functions to an object even for when users LOOK at an object or for when you literally just touch it.) Also, you can use scripting on your own avatar! and add animations (More than just lip sync) for when you talk, or you can add buttons to yourself. (I've seen a chicken flying a UFO that could fire sunny-side up eggs at you with a button on their wrist.)One of the only things that I find very limiting is the lack of grouped objects.. Currently it can be difficult/time consuming to animate many objects on a single creation.. (My avi has ears made of many parts, I'd LOVE to animate them, and I could but I'd be required to move all parts precisely.. And I just get lazy.. x3)You also have an inventory where you can copy/save many creations you find entertaining or useful, and it's also very simple and easy to use (Tablet on your back that holds tiny versions of the objects you've saved.)And currently there's a decent amount of creations to explore! I've seen a nightclub with a working DJ table,Large forrests,  mazes, a working RPG with written dialog, a recreation of someone's living room in a tree house!And much (Admittedly not TOO much.) more that I've personally seen, but I need to explore more...All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this game, I will admit that the user base isn't high.. And that's one of the reasons I'm writing this review, but even when not hanging out with anyone you can be busy on creations! And also there's usually atleast a few users to say ""Hello"" to.I want this game to rise to add more worth to existing creations and for many new ones to come!I overall highly recommend this game and hope to see new users soon."

The ability to run little scripts for animating parts of things you build is mind boggling. I bought this after reading all the glowing reviews thinking that it might be fun. When I started using it I met people who had only been using the program for a few weeks and had created huge areas of really amazing things. This seems to be what VR was made for. It is something where you have to create to get something back out of it but once you start you won't want to stop. You don't have to be an artist, just have some amount of curiosity and off you go.

With the friendly community, bouncing ideas off each other & helping solve design problems is fun.I was initially wary of Anyland because I read ""scripting"" and thought ""too complicated"" and that was a mistake to think this. Scripting is optional but it's simple auto-complete commands from lists + your own variables. So simple, yet still powerful. Watch Philipp's short tutorial vids with quick examples, then experiment.Now I see various VR games, like wave shooters or ""experiences"" like walking around in an artsy environment for example, and instantly think ""I can make that myself in an evening or 2 in Anyland."" ;-)In the Top 5 ""Must Have"" Vive programs for me!Anyland is exactly what I wanted for VR and has taken over most of my VR game time since I bought it.Not content just cons00ming experiences, I want to create & build *anything*. And now I can create even worlds.Everything is fairly intuitive to do, from creating to moving to manipulating & resizing shapes; it all feels natural. This is 3-D modelling the way I always wanted, not in a 3-D CAD program on a 2-D monitor with a 2-D mouse.The UI in-game for everything is smartly designed for interaction with VR hands. The devs are thinking in VR, not thinking of traditional 2-D UI for monitors and forcing it into VR.Because controls & interfaces are smartly designed and intuitive, modelling things can be done fast after a very short learning curve.The low-poly and low-texture aesthetic of Anyland helps to make modelling fast and easy, and thus the system requirements aren't obscene. (I've looked at other world-building VR programs out now which are ambitious and high-poly and I nope out because they're overly complex to create in.)There's a straight-forward scripting language with auto-complete options which is simple to learn & use. This takes the possibilities from static objects & scenery to near-limitless possibilities.The dev is active on the Steam forums and listens to suggestions, sometimes implementing new features & script commands the next day!Meeting other people in VR and chatting is always a great experience. In Anyland where you create your own avatar from scratch, it's even more impressive than other social VR ""games"" because you can fully represent how you want to look, not restricted to things like humanoid or... anything at all.My only complaint is a personal one: I want to create so many things, buildings, and worlds and I only have so much time in a night!Fans of RPO: this is like a nascent OASIS.Bottom-line:If you have a Vive, and enjoy exploring worlds and/or creating things then get Anyland!"

The community is welcoming, there are complete works of art in a lot of places, and it's building is a lot more fun than all of the other games I own. The multiplayer works well, the servers have never crashed, and the only thing that limits you is your imagination."

Create worlds, visit other people's worlds, build anything, ad lights, emitters, and script interactions, and make you own avatar body.By far the best VR game I have; I will be going to this every chance I get.EDIT: I built the world called ""Anywhere"" which is a hub world with portals to other worlds so look me up when you get this game and I can help you out :)"

,Recommended,505700,31776245,Posted: 15 May,all,VeGas GhOst,"Built for VR and ONLINE play ONLY...A fantastic title in which you can build and code almost anything with some trail and error, there are some annoying limitations at the moment and numerous bugs, but updates come on a regular basis and if given some love and a local download option to save your worlds and items this has real promise, Games like Garrys Mod and Little Big Planet are the only other aalternatives i can think of in this Genre im calling ""User Generation"" in which the game you play IS the game you create, want flying toasters? done, want a gun that shoots waffles, done.This genre badly needs more titles such as this as Anyland is in a way a simplified Game engine such as Unreal or Unity in game form, so again with more updates, bug fixes, and a much needed desktop/controller mode for quick building on a laptop on the go, this will be one of my favorite games of all time."

MY only complaint about the game would be that i wish the community was bigger.  But if you are on the fence about this game go to youtube and watch some of the crazy stuff people are doing in this game.  I'm, sure you will be sold on it afterwards."

You can create any little world you want to be in. Dark and spooky. Bright and happy.... It is amazing!I can't wait to see everyones creations.

But right now it feels like it's still in development, and I can't recommend it just yet.This isn't a hard ""No"", but it's still a ""No"".It's an online world that lets you build just about anything. The main problems I encountered though are that building things is difficult, clunky, and impercise. I often struggled to accomplish what I wanted to do, or once I finally did what I wanted to do I accidently undid it, or realized I can't edit it, and couldn't figure out why.The shapes you get to work with are very basic, I'd have liked to have more options.It's an online game, but because it's a paid game there's not as many people there as you'd find in other online games.In the game's favor, the developers are still working on putting in more things and improving it all on a frequent basis, so like I said, maybe one day, but not worth your money just yet unless you really want to be in on this from the start."

It gave some of the basic out lines such as how to move between worlds and stuff, but it still didnt help any more than that. When i came back on i started building a house on my area, which took me forever because of the controls. In the middle of building it, my house got deleted randomly. Really its no fun."

Then this is the game for you.Pros:Design in a 3D space with simple and easy to use controls.Programming and animating an object is exceedingly easy to learn. (I taught my roommate with no programming experience in only a few minutes)Create your own worlds that others can build in and explore (if you let them)Multiplayer is smooth and lag is non-existantCons:plenty of bugs (it came out only a week and a half ago)limited 3D models to choose from

And make no mistake they are probably the most active VR devs around, with exciting updates coming thick and fast. In VR this is the place to be, to create or endlessly explore what others have built.The community is great,  You can 3d print what you make in VR, which is awesome, and works really well (especialy if you want to build artculated robots!) and makes for great multimedia shinanigans.So come to anyland, it's party time! :)"
