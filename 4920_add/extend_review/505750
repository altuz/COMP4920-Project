You run a barber shop and give people awesome beards and mustaches.Downside is the controls. Some may find them fun(ny), while others will find them frustrating. I haven't found a way to trim small details yet, so usually the person has a lopsided, patchy beard. It's okay, the customers don't seem to mind, where as I would never pay anyone for such a bad job, lol. I'd love to see more tools added, maybe some more fine-detail trimmers or beard stencils.It's free (as of writing this), so try it out for yourself and see what you think!4/5 - would trim again"

Overall its a fun game for when you are bored."
