,Not Recommended,506140,30122889,Posted: 23 February,all,SatiraNL,"I used to love this game when it first came out, as it reminded me of Swords and Potions 2, a game I played for many many years. Cloudcade was scheduled to take over S&P2, but in the end it didn't go through.They made this game however, and back then it was a great game. They communicated nicely with their player base and I have even given them many ideas to make gameplay better, including ideas that are implemented in game. I felt appreciated and thus I loved supporting them.I recently returned to play again, and enjoyed it a lot, until I ran into trouble that wasn't there before. They made changes in game to punish new players and to reward their old. As new player, you get many restrictions that make you even more behind on the older players than you already were.They want you to pay for everything, and their ingame packages are extremely expensive.When you start to talk to cloudcade themselves, they are extremely rude and disregard you in every possible way. Sadly, it has begun to feel like an unfair game to new players, and I suggest not getting started on this one. It's a nice game, but extremely unfair and it's only there to fill their pockets with your hardearned cash.They even make fun of you if you have more accounts (different platforms) and let you know it is not allowed, even though you just started the game on different places and you can't help you can't link them to the other places. So it's your fault that they don't give you the option to log in from one place on different places. They are funny sometimes. Blame the players and not the company!Not even worth 1 star. Luckily I don't need to give any with the steam system ^^"

I find it to be nuanced, well-balanced, and have more options and features than I was expecting. That said, it is one of those endless, Farmeville-esque, ""you have things to do, but it's largely just fun busy work"" sort of simulator/time waster game (it is NOT an ""idle"" genre game).The game puts you in the role of a combined shop owner, blacksmith, hero-trainer, wall-street trader, and mayor (yes- there are a lot of features in game, and they merge together rather smoothly). Make goods and then sell them, equip them to your heroes, or trade them on the market. Get gold to gain access to a larger store with more resources, or invest in your town/your clan's town to power up buildings (with temporary boosts and permanent bonuses). Level your heroes, your crafters, and yourself. Send heroes out to get unique craft supplies, or battle in the arena in a simple, but functional short strategy match against the computer.I never want to diminish other people's experiences, but I disagree with some of the negative reviews. In particular I'd like to take note of the in-game purchases. I haven't spent any real money on the game, and feel very satisfied with my current options and ability to grow strong. Even if that diminishes in time, I got a -lot- of playtime out of this game, for no cost. There are also work-arounds for many of the challenges in game, so if you're clever and like to stop and think, you might find an option that a more hasty player misses.The game is playable solo or in a ""clan"". I think that early on, the content is well balanced for solo play, but many people will want to be in a group so they have access to more power (in the form of heroes, crafters, and resources).One weird game dynamic (and this might be a negative), is that he game is the busiest at the beginning. There are a ton of things to do and open up, and the timers are all very short. Later on, even though you unlock more things, timers grow from 10 seconds to 10 minutes. If you're smart, you can fill in a lot of that time (mostly on the market, but also in the arena), but looking at some of the reviews, a lot of people would rather sit around and complain about the timer than explore ways to make use of that time. Don't get me wrong- I totally understand if you don't want to get to a point where a game has very lengthy timers- and as you level up, I'm guessing the timers get even longer. I'm including that here in case that's helpful information knowing what you're getting into/want to avoid. It's just annoying for people to pretend there's ""nothing to do!"", just because it's not being handed to them in an obvious way. I'm soloing myself through the mid-levels, because I'm using all available resources, and it keeps me busy. At the same time, this game genre is meant to be more of a ""in the background"", light-attention style of gameplay, so it may lend itself better to someone who isn't looking for non-stop action, anyways.I feel that this game is a fun experience if you want some fairly engaging, but ultimately no-pressure, grinding in the form of resource management and RPG-light character training. It's quite possibly the most fun at the beginning, so you can always try it to guage for yourself if you like it, without feeling committed to tons of time to see the best ""end-game"" content that is the case for many games."

76561198264335255,Recommended,506140,30025694,Posted: 18 February,all,squeakandme,"Decent game, good time waster.  Premium currency can be obtained free, albeit slowly, so I would tend to ignore the whiners that it is a P2W game.  What winning?  It isn't even competitive except in the completely avoidable and unnecessary PvP, which in itself is fairly new.   Does cash make the game go faster? It sure can!  Does it allow access to a more extensive blueprint line?  Of course.  More character customizations?  Well duh.  When does it not in any free to play game?  Are you really that new to this whole online gaming thing?  But none of those are necessary to play or advance in Shop Heroes.  If you have patience, dislike action based games, and like a bit of a random loot roll now and then, I recommend giving this a shot.  I find it relaxing since I can cross-stitch or read while waiting for those double barrel shotguns to finish crafting.  Might finish that book yet.What I like:-Easy to learn.  Yep, no needing to haunt Google or decipher a poorly managed wiki to comprehend the gameplay.  It is simple and straightforward, though I am not sure why a pendant requires enough leather to supply the NFL with footballs for a year, in addition to enough iron and steel to attract bulk buyers for General Motors.  But I digress.-No active time based stuff.  You don't have to finish what you start.  I don't mean be lazy; I mean if you are playing and there is a knock at the door, you aren't going to die, lose loot, miss an opportunity, etc. if you go answer it.  Your game progress will still be there when you shuffle back to it with that newly purchased/opened/eaten box of Girl Scout cookies.  Nothing lost.  Now go wash the Thin Mints off your hands.  You pig.-Trading.  The trade house is active and vibrant and offers a 'play it your way' dynamic to the game.  Some players go for crafting mastery, one thing at a time, some for unlocking new items as soon as they can, others play the trade house like a gem-driven stock market.  Don't let people in world chat tell you there is only one right way to play.  In fact, ignore  world chat all together.  They only want your Thin Mints anyway.  Those pigs.Now, things I find not so rosy.-Math.  The math seems incredibly broken.  I can send a hero out with 2 sadly underleveled pieces of gear, both with a 10-12% break chance, and it won't break for like 6 missions, if at all.  But, I can buy or craft a flawless piece of gear at the heroes level with a 0.9% chance of breaking and it will, at most, last 2 missions.  Not once in a while either.  Perpetually.  Seems the luck is programmed to try to force you to shell out gems to re-equip your heroes and send them back into the fray.  Good thing I am patient.  And like crafting.  Re-equipping after every mission is nigh unavoidable.-Fusion Pot.  Expensive and slow to upgrade in levels, very expensive to unlock a 2nd slot.  Also, you can't use the fusion pot while it is upgrading, which is contrary to anything else you upgrade, such as workstations, resource bins, and storage items, which stay in use while upgrading.  That becomes an issue when upgrades get to the 16+ hour mark.-The last and admittedly minor one, is a trading house bug.  It is constantly yelling telling me I can't exceed a maximum price, before I have even set one.  It also glitches upon entering a price.  I can type in 100,000, hit enter, and it will randomly change itself to something else.  That hurts when I don't realize it reset my 100,000 to 10,000 and I submit the listing.  Especially since you are punished with a 3 day cool down when cancelling.Long and short of it, it is a quick download, a pretty smooth port of a mobile game, and free.  I like free."
,Recommended,506140,29480031,Posted: 25 January,all,ƸӁƷ ♥Hot Lips♥ ƸӁƷ,"(Revised Review from Original Review i done last year)(Shop Heroes) I started this game back in aug 2016 and i found it addictive and nice to play and great enjoyment to me, i did a review back last year based on the game then and gave it a negative review this was due to many factors.Firstly back last year the game was worse with unbalanced wheel which i am happy to say has been corrected now and is so much better.The promotion packs is slightly different but the developers still needs to reduce the price of there packs to attract the less poorer market as the cost of living is getting higher each year and less people will want to play this game if it becomes too costly to play it as in the beginning you find you won't depend on the promotion packs to play the game but later you will need them to get Blue Prints and new workers and so on.This game depends on the people who play it meaning the less people that join and play it the result would be the game would fold in a couple of years as some free to play games do as the cost of running servers becomes more then any profits earned from the game.So i find costly promotion packs may get vast profits fast but in the end kills the game as you have exausted your market as nobody can afford your prices....So to get around this the prices for promotion packs should be reduced so to fall in line with all walks of life, so your getting the most out of the game market as $49.99 for a pack is far to expensive even in this day and age at this price your only attracting the higher end of the market.Also if price drops more people would join and play it which in turn boosts sales of packs and increases your profits and the more people that play this game the better for everyone as this game TOTALY depends on the people that is attracted to it.The other thing is chests needs to be improved to have a better % drop rate of Blue Prints as in the last 9 months of play i have not got 1 Blue Print from any chests i have opened so that needs to be better balanced.Also you need to introduce new Blue Prints for the weekend raids as running the same ones over and over again is negative in my mind it's ok to run the same Blue Prints twice or 3 times a year for those who may of missed it the 1st or 2nd time and for those who are new players.Also you need to introduce a primal key for the Primal chests as 700 gems is a bit costly to open a chest or reduce the cost of gems needed to open the chest also the gifts should be better, i only opened 1 primal chest ever which costs 700 Gems i recieved 8 primal horns which i could of bought for much less gems, i swore i would never open another primal chest again.those are the bad points.The good things is the wheel is now balaced and the game runs betterThe graphics is goodThe sound is goodThe game does have an addictiveness to it when you get into it at first it can be a grinde leveling up heroes/shop workers and leveling up yourself but it can be fun all the way if you do it right.The game seems simple to play it is not, it has a learning curve much to learn and experiance but when you truly get into it you won't want to play anything else.I am sure there is lots more things that will be introduced to improve this game over time but as it is now i will give it a positive review based on a score of 7 out of 10.This is my 2nd review of this game dated 11/08/2017My 1st review was negative based on many factors which many has been corrected."
76561198038769352,Not Recommended,506140,29420184,Posted: 22 January,all,Dr Jazz Man,"This game is great to play. While it's not necessarily fun it's certainly satisfying, however...Heroes that you equip to go on quests for you, have a percentage based chance to break the equipment you give them based on the difference in level, quality of equipment and whether they have a preference for that item type. Generally your looking at a 1-3% break chance and the only way to repair them is the premium currency (which you can earn a fair amount of for free).With this explained I would warn you that unless you can tolerate the stupendous bad luck that is programmed against you, don't bother starting this game. One Hero with say, 6 items that have a 0.9% break chance will almost always break something at least every second mission. It's blatant fraud and incredibly frustrating."
,Recommended,506140,29514555,Posted: 26 January,all,Vault,"BEST GAME EVER!Ignore the above comment, it was a joke.This game decently performs as a store management game. I'll admit I came late into the scene so I haven't seen how spectacular it was before the updates people seem to mention.I find that the pay to win isn't here,buttheres always the caveat.It is a grind intensive game.I recommend never playing this game while waiting for someone to finish what your doing in a mall or something, lest you fall asleep in the chair like a lazy slob. Instead put it off to the side while doing something on your computer and check in on it to see how your questing is going or if your crafting is done.Community is something I'll always talk about in reviews. The people are great, always willing to help and give advice.Leveling is something to be detested, its slow and painful. I'll also say the same thing about ""fusion"".Overall I found this game lacking in some features that would make others turn away but I find it to be what you would normally expect from a casual game.So hate it or love it."
