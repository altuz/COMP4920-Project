,Recommended,506500,28492716,"Posted: 20 December, 2016",all,RockstarCRO,"Just because I like reminders : remember to do your homework before purchasing any early access games. This includes videos of the game itself, searching discussions and forums and checking out the developers reputation. If there is a road-map included, all the better.Welcome to Party Panic where chaos is met with a smile. Like most Humans, I saw this game and instantly made a comparison. I compared it to Mario party and was wondering if it could be just as good. Unlike Mario Party, Party Panic does not have a board system. Rather, mini-games are played back to back while scores are displayed after each game. The way the scores are displayed is beautiful, and whats even more beautiful is the fact you can punch or kick a buddy off a higher pedestal than yours. As your score grows, so does your pedestal.The player has almost thirty mini-games to choose from with the addition of a gauntlet mode. Of the thirty mini-games, some that are included are sprint orientated games (such as smacking a post or running for your life), sumo ball orientated games (such as collecting coins, a soccer mimic and classic sumo), dodge-based games (such as running from an avalanche, jumping over a rotating blade, dodging ghosts and dodging falling rocks or players), fighting-based games (such as scoring points for landing blows), collection based games, racing orientated games and finally coordination sort of games (which involves pressing the right buttons at the right time).There is a decent amount of variance so far within the mini-game realm. Thegameplayfeels very classic to me. Meaning, even though the objective or dynamics are simple the game is still quite challenging. When playing with friends, the atmosphere becomes even more intense when everyone is rushing as fast as they can to get the combination down. This is a breath of fresh air in a sense as it evens the playing field for anyone. Expert gamers to n00bs are sure to get enjoyment. Any game that someone can perfect is nice, but having a game where everyone has a fair chance is golden. Moreover, there is a pretty cool gaming feature included that attempts to keep all players involved at all times. In certain mini-games (not all yet I'm hoping), when a player is knocked out they still have a chance at redeeming themselves and sometimes scoring points. For example, in an boulder-falling game or falling-tiles game, players that have been knocked out from active game play can still attack other players from the grave. In these two games, the fallen players can aim and sometimes control the projectile they fire out. This is an amazing feature as it attempts to keep everyone involved even when they are out! Successful games (virtual or not) are successful for the sole reason everyone is still participating. This is a step in the right direction and I encouraged it to go even further! I hope to see this continue and a lot more variances and new stages in the future.Gauntlet is a series of linear mini-games back to back. This is a solid addition and gives players a break from playing mini-games. Unlike mini-games where there are pauses, players are competing in real time and with one another. Players can choose how many stages to have prior to starting the gauntlet. The stages don't have too many variances at the moment, but the concept is on the right track to creating a fun alternative to mini-games. Some stages include dodging spikes, jumping platforms and avoiding spinning blades. Players are participating with other players and can interfere with one another. This is fun and annoying as landing on someone's head gives you an extra bounce up into the sky. To win the gauntlet, players have to make it to the end. Progress can be tracked by viewing the middle of the screen; the heads of the players will appear in the middle and as the player progresses further, so will their icon. There is also a death count that keeps a toll of how many times you fell off the stage. The game will end when one player reaches the very end and comes into contact with a stepping stone.Visually, the style suits what the game is about. Cartoony, funny, playful and emotional. The cartoon and comical aspect are reciprocal to one another. It's funny seeing these things getting bounced around everywhere. The expressions on players faces is the icing on the cake. Whether they are getting rocks thrown at them, running from a whale trying to eat them, snow trying to crush them, or lava trying to burn them, the players are laughing, showing signs of worry, straight faced or sticking their tongue out. This is just a pleasure to watch when everyone is going full speed and the players in the game are making faces.The soundsare OK as of the moment. They are accurate, but a little more umph and emphasis needs to be added. Key sounds are always important to making an impact. I can still hear the ping from the game WCW vs NWO revenge when a wrestler runs into a steel ring post. My suggestion would be to diversify the sounds between different characters... maybe even using different voices like worms did? Moreover, the music is on the right track and does a good job giving a little bounce to the mini games. I'm curious to see what else is to come in this domain. Although sound and music may be considered a brush up touch to the final product, it can really enhance the experience.Overall, the game is fun and engaging. Because it is in limited regarding development, there may be only so much replayability for certain players. Depending on the crowd, I can see people easily throwing a couple of hours per session (especially with the drinking game mode turned on). The games and gauntlet are still in development; adding more inclusive and dynamic games will ensure Party Panic's success. There is online capabilities at the moment, but finding a game is a bit difficult. I recommend playing with local players to maximize this games effect.To the developer, I have a few suggestions :>Keep adding mini-games. New stages may bring new ideas and game-modes. On the other hand, the stages you currently have are also open to modification. Small objective, player or terrain changes can fuel these new modes. The best games (be it virtual or not) can be in the form of modified games. A soccer game can be broken up or modified in many ways to make it fair or even more fun. Try to keep an open mind!>Personalizing characters is great. I think adding whatever designs come to mind in regards to hats or color should be added. I do like how the characters make faces throughout the game. You could potentially give the player some control over this.>Gauntlet is a really cool feature that gives the player a break from mini-game sessions. This linear and continuous game is pretty sweet, but can still use some tweaks. More stages, modifications and variances definitely need to be added here. It would be interesting perhaps to add items or some sort of ""X"" factor that rattles all players wherever they are on the map.>I would recommend making the classic sumo mode less mobile. This is not to say restrict movement, but add some weight to the sumo balls. Flying around everywhere at full speed is fun; adding some weight or momentum can add some difficulty and strategy to the movements.>Continue to add elements of inclusiveness; when players die allow them to compete in one way or another.EARLY ACCESS RATING : 6.9/10GameplayB-Story / CampaignN/AVisuals / User InterfaceB-Sounds / MusicC+Replay-abilityC+OverallC+Video :Party Panic Highlight Review"

A few of the mini-games are fun , but many seem like 2nd rate versions of Bishi Bashi, Mario Party etcLike the ghost shooting one... multiple identical ghosts appear..you move your target and shoot..nothing happens..you just hear a ping each time you hit the ghost and get a point, then after set time the ghost dissapears.., so you move to the next ghost and repeat, it's like the worlds blandest version of Point Blank.Maybe have the ghost actually react to getting shot, or dissapear after one shot, or add some power ups , or ""shoot your own colour"", anything to make it a bit more entertaining!New games are being added, and online has been added so the dev is still working on the game. Its great more content is being added, but the existing games still need more depth and polish.Im a big fan of classic multiplayer games, so im hoping this one improves. Thumbs down for the time being."

,Recommended,506500,33165200,Posted: 2 July,all,DonsSword,"Party Panic is the party game collection Steam has been missing, reminiscent of a big named console series featuring a certain plumber and his friends, but without the long, drawn-out dice rolling board game.Without the board game, Party Panic focuses on the minigame goodness. Minigames are thoughtfully designed, with simple, cute visuals, and tight, gamepad friendly controls.For me, what makes Party Panic all the more amazing, is that it is built by a single developer, who actively engages with the community to grow and improve the game."

For example, it feels unfair how long you're knocked out when hit by another player.As a recommendation to the developer: show the game at conventions and exhibitions, and maybe private parties - and look how the players play the game. Also, the mini-games are nearly all fun, but the intermission thing is much longer, it feels too long (especially when one of the players doesn't press ""A"")."

I'm glad that it is easy to play with a keyboard & mouse.- Some Early Access games are not that good, not finished, not playable etc but this one is a really enjoyable game with more than 30 mini games and also this game looks like a promising game, I hope they don't do something wrong and ruin it. I didn't play all mini games but I hope I will be able to play all of them.- I think I played with 3 different people and they were friendly.- If there is not enough players in the room, there are bots so you don't have to wait for more players to start playing.I might change or update my review later but I just want to say that I recommend this game and it is worth paying $12 (currently has discount)"

,Not Recommended,506500,34702455,Posted: 2 September,all,Jehsun,"Really wish that I could like this game, but my expectations are far from met. I was very hopeful to have a good minigame type of game on PC, but unfortunately I will have to wait a bit longer it seems.Pros:- Colorful vibrant graphicsGame looks very nice and I'm mostly a fan of the art style.- Lots of fun/cool character customizationThere are lots of cool hats to collect that add a bit of an incentive to keep playing that dont cost any additional money.Cons:- Most of the minigames feel the sameMost of the minigames feel the same with only a couple of genuinely unique and fun to play games here and there. A majority of the games youll play have the same kind of gimmick to them. Youll be put into some stage and punch of kick people while trying to do a somewhat samey tasks eacxh game has to offer. Some games are a good relief from this such as the food eating game the game in which you rapidly press a button to break as many pieces to a tower as possible and maybe 1 or 2 others which I cannot remember.- Poorly designed UIThe game tries to be more unique and has a ui that is minimal and allows the polayers to mess around while waiting in lobby. While this idea sounds nice it ends up becoming players trying to ready up and then mistakenly unreadying when jumping around the lobby room. A more streamlined menu focused ui would be very nice for this game.- Poor controlsThink of Gang Beasts, the characters movement is very unprecise and is kinda wonky in general, however unlike Gang Beasts the gimmick really does not work well for this kind of game at all.- Terrible points systemEach minigame gives you points up to 1000 points and the game can be set to a few different limits such as 5000. Games often are easy enough to have multiple ties because the limit of each minigame and the fact that points are given to players as individual scores not based on how they placed in the match. Many games allow players to keep playing until each player has reached the max 1000 points and does not stop when one player hits the max so the other player can catch up in many cases ending in a 4 way tie for 1000 points each."

,Recommended,506500,34361514,Posted: 19 August,all,Angry Gerbil,"i wish there was an in-between on recommendations.Being that this is the only real party game on PC (like mario party aka) i shall rate it up.if the dev reads this PLEASE listen...you formed a framework for the game; its not really fully complete yet. trying to get this game on PS4 and XBox is the LAST THING you should be worried about right now. It's not that the game is bad its just lacking in too much content to try to sell to other systems. I'd say try to aim to at LEAST 50 mini games total, and a overall game overylay much like the game board from mario party rather than just showing a series of stats from the total mini games played.point being, you have been on the right path however you as the development team are at a fork in the road and I personally believe your about to pick the wrong route. develop this game a bit more in terms of content then feel free to push it on to consoles!AS FOR PLAYERS!this is pretty much it if your looking for a mario party-esque game. its fairly funny with friends, and even has a built in drinking game which is nice~ however as the content is short it feels lacking for any extended play. if your looking for some fun couch games with friends i suggest Crawl.at its current state its a 6/10 for me.ill likely update this when they add more content."

Controller support and local splitscreen makes a for a very fun time!Would recommend."
