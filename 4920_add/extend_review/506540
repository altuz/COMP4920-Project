At the end it's them who make the game. We're actively involved with our community through the official forums, and welcome all players to join us in a discussion on what they want to see in the game.You have never heard of us since WarZ 2012, ONLY MONEY MONEY MONEYUpdate May 2017: Many Hackers - Lagging Server - deleating Threads when you report Hackers"

Unfortunately we were misguided with the early alpha when we could find games. Now not ONE single game has started. The community it dead and in a game style like this one, that means the game as a whole is dead. Has been three days and not ONE game has been started. Unfortunately for my wife and I since we played it over two hours we can't receive a refund and that is $15 we will never get back. I love supporting small dev games like this but I can't when they make no effort to talk to their players on their forums or listen to complaints. They haven't responded to anyone on the forums in over a week. I think they realized that their claims for ""big streamers"" and more were false and decided to give up on the game themselves! Avoid unfortunately!UPDATE: Game is now very much populated, but the DEVS clearly don't care about us players. The game is 90% Taiwanese, 8% Brazilian, and 2% USA/CA. Only thing I find entertaining is ""The Proving Grounds"" as the BR style game is filled with hackers and teamers."

,Not Recommended,506540,29295375,Posted: 16 January,all,Criticizer,No one plays the game. The barrier that kills you does to much damage. The map is cancer because the starting zone is directly in the middle of the map so when the last couple safe zones are there its a roll of the dice if your doing to live or die. The guns are so similar i cant tell the difference from an smg or a ar. The med kit in the game is not bad that you can heal when being shot. The sniper is extremely rare which sucks i feel it would be more fun with more snipers. The armor system is quiet annoying because it doesn't even seem to help mitigate damage at all. Take forever to get in a game if possible at all. Do not waste ur money on this game i regret buying it every day.

I waited almost 30min and only like 4 people joined, have to have 30 to start.. should have been free to people who have Shattered Skies.  Yeah, I know the whole deal with the devs.. I just really like BR games; So, I thought to myself ""Hey, maybe this one will be different"", then I thought ""Well, maybe people are using the launcher and not steam to play. So,steamcharts.comcould have the numbers wrong"".?. Yeah, totally fooled myself into buying it. Now I'm waiting for a refund.."

Don't waste your money. Literally nobody is playing it. Server is a ghost town.Maybe the community will pick back up after a big update... (like the co-op - which it doesn't have yet...)"

If you would like to pay for a lobby simulator please, buy this game immediately. If not? Avoid like the plague."

,Not Recommended,506540,28555707,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,RedWolfZ,"A shattered skies version of battle royale/king of the hill type of game. Decent potential but considering the state of shattered skies the last few months , might go down hill. Regardless.ProsSpawn automatically to an isolated area where you can at least get a decent set up without getting instant killed trying to land and be the first to get to a gun.Customization for your gun as you go, found it nice that I could pick up mods for a gun.Graphics are pleasant though I was running frames at 40-50 with an old 750.Recoil on guns makes it where you have to have skills to get kills or lose.Nice arrangement of armour/equipment scattered around .ConsLobby time is very annoying. Found some matches where I had to wait for x amount of players to join and then a 2""30 minute countdown timer.Amount of players spawned in a map is low. Only 40 or 50 players which lead to me sometimes just running around gearing up untl I either got shot from behind or was lucky to run on a player with his back turned and kill him.Some issues running into objects, found it annoying trying to go through some cracks big enought to get through but had to crouch and move around to get through.Owned by the same company as Shattered Skies.H1Z1 King of the hill Clone."
