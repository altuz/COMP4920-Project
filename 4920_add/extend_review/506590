Rest in peace originality.There's actually potential for a decent game here, if the gamemodes were a bit more varied rather than all the same thing, and the assets didn't cost $29.50 it could actually be a calming, fun flight sim. But alas, every gamemode is the same and the game was designed by somebody else..."

Pay $29.50 onhttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/55700or pay $1,79 for this?Tell me where is the problem?The principle you're right, that's why I would like to make refund but not only; the game is incomplete that was a reason of the cheap price, have a more potential to be the best fly simulator, but without a multiplayer, statistics, story line, more music, more achievements, more mission and other, it's just a copy of incomplete idea from the original developer (It's not stolen and reverted). So if you are confused as me meanwhile stay away and wait for news updating, but If you want to play a casual race fly game with gorgeous world that make you in a trip, take it!"

Sorta reminds me of The Polynomialthe music sucks and is on a endless loopthe menus are ♥♥♥♥ed up, scrolling is sooo slow and the entire interface is weirdBest thing is the graphicsThe price is very low, and it should be. But even then i say skip this, there are far better arcade games out there"

,Not Recommended,506590,24978667,"Posted: 17 August, 2016",all,JuicyJimbles,"You basically fly a plane, searching for orbs that replenish your fuel.The very few orbs that you can find on the map are so well hidden and far away from each other that, even if you are able to spot one of them, you will most likely use all of your fuel trying to get there.The music can be pretty boring after a short while, along with the game modes which HAD to include the search for those orbs.The only thing that's actually pretty good is the color choice.Not recommended.TLDR; Nice colors, awful game. Definitely not worth any amount of money."

From what I gathered from the trailer, I thought this was to be a simple and relaxing game with calming visuals and a cheery soundtrack. I assumed the game had a variety of game modes. Whilst the visuals and soundtrack delivers, the gameplay overall feels shallow. There is only one game mode (how far can you get your plane to go before crashing or running out of fuel) and that has brought me no relaxation.I should've known better, realized that this was asset flipped, and not wasted my money on this game."

,Recommended,506590,24719863,"Posted: 4 August, 2016",all,Windshear,"EDIT: Apparently, it's a premade asset, with a few additions from the developer. You're getting a premade asset with some mods, for 90% off the original price. At face value though? I can still say it's an okay game.Does exactly what it describes. Fun, simple time waster that looks nice and of course runs well. Controls are easy to pick up and the levels can at times be difficult, but not frustratingly so. I'd recommend it for $2.Also trading cards :^)"

,Recommended,506590,24786597,"Posted: 8 August, 2016",all,Haji,"For $1.79 it is a very enjoyable game and is VERY aesthetically pleasing. It is an ""endless runner"" but the maps are not procedurally generated as far as I know so you can learn routes to make it further each time. The controls are inverted since you are playing as a plane which can be both annoying and difficult but it doesn't make the game less enjoyable if that is an issue.I have a video with gameplay of ""Sky Valley"" if you want to see what it's like before buying it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB110V4qIsUAll in all I do like this game but for $1.79 you are getting $1.79 worth of content and there isn't much but it has plane unlockables and different maps and game modes so if you are looking for a cheap time killer this is a great game."

,Recommended,506590,24797825,"Posted: 9 August, 2016",all,wshand,"Sky Valley is like a really beautiful but dumb girl. Pleasant to look at and spend time with at first, but as the hours drain away you realize there's an emptiness within it. All those good looks are just a facade that covers up the fact that there's nothing really behind it all. Just the same level over and over again with the same pleasant soundtrack backing you up.What am I really complaining about? My time with this game only cost me $1. It is an IOS port. Sure my controller works in game but doesn't work in the menus at all. Sure the fuel pickups for the plane are badly spaced out and difficult to see so trial and error is the only way to get better at this title. But once again it was only $1.10/10 would buy again at the same price, worth every 5 min I spent with it."
