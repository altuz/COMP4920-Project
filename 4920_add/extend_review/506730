You play and play forever in the same MAP!Yes, I say again, only 1 single MAP!There are 60 ""days"" (levels) in that exactly the same map. Which makes the game incredibly repetitive and boring.The game is exactly the same as the Dinosaur Hunt, it is the same developer, but there is only one difference between the 2 games: in this game you play in only 1 map. Even the weapons are alike.The game has a lot achievements, 340 achievements in March 04 2017. The developer of this game is well known for always being adding achievements in all the games that he develops, he just keeps on adding.So, even if you buy the game just because of the achievements, I do not recommended that you make the purchase.So believe me, this game even being cheap isNOT WORTH IT."

This game is developed by the same guys who released ""Dinosaur Hunt"" - You should be warned.In the current state there are the following ""features"":- Two maps, one for the tutorial, and another one for the ""campaign"".- The so called ""campaign"": Survive 10 rounds, called ""days"", and kill dinosaurs to succeed.- Five weapons: Axe, Sword, Flashlight, Bow and Heavy Bow.- Four different enemies: Raptor, Triceratops, Stegosaurus and T-Rex.- Dozens of ultra-simple achievements (Press ""W"" to move forward -> Achievement unlocked!)How is the gameplay?Forget about the Axe, the Sword, and the Flashlight. The only useful weapon is the bow. You start playing on the only map (Achievement unlocked!), running in circles to avoid contact with the dinosaurs and shoot them in the head (Achievement unlocked!). If you're low on ammo, collect some (Achievement unlocked!). When its getting dark, pause the game and activate ""Nightvision"" in the menu (Achievement unlocked!). Try that with the other effects like ""Colors"", ""Rain"", or ""Thermal Vision"" - guess whats coming next? Right! Achievement unlocked.Conclusion:Running around on the only map and killing four kinds of dinosaurs with the bow. Beware, Triceratops and T-Rex need MANY arrows to the head until they're dead (There are headshot Achievements, of course).Prediction for the future:The game will stay in the early-access phase for the next six months. After these six months and a few changes regarding the gameplay the game will leave the early-access phase. To increase the profit, some DLCs will be released, like ""Replacing-the-dinos-with-Aliens-stuff"", ""Adding-WW2-weapons-stuff"" or ""Replacing-the-enemies-with-Zombies-stuff"", and the game will be another add to the ""heartless ramshackled, never finished"" game section.Avoid!"

,Not Recommended,506730,26408534,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,Psytron,"How to say this...What works? The achievements. A big pile of them. Started the game? Here is an achievement. Walked left, right? Here are two more of them... Jumped? Omg, here is ANOTHER achievement. Is it day? Bang, one more... Crouch? Holster? Fire without a gun in your hands? All of this will give you a dumb torrent of achievements. Like, 23 in 10 minutes. This reason alone is enough for me to hate the game.What doesn't work? A lot of things actually, but the most annoying is the attack system, where clearly programming of features is missing. If you watch the video with this review you will see how you can stand near a dinosaur attacking you but giving no damage at all. I stood for like 4 minutes in the same place before this ferocious raptor could kill me.This is a Early Access game. It doesn't mean the price tag currently on is fair - because it is not. Perhaps one or two more weeks of programming before uploading to the Store would make a difference, perhaps not, but here is Dinosaur Forest being a strong disapointment on me.Please don't get me wrong: It took me 5 seconds to see the game, purchase it and proceed to install it, as the dino-lover I am. I really wanted the game to be good, but as of now it is too much broken to be actually enjoyed.And should we say something about optimization? A mountain, a player controller and one single dinosaur make of the first map a lag hell already.Sadly, much bug, few dinos. My review is 100% negative AS OF NOW, but, as this is an Early Access I am watching closely for upgrades and bug fixes to see if the developers can make of it a reasonably good game. The idea is there and I like it, the game itself is just too much broken.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc0wvu-XTFM"

,Not Recommended,506730,26565006,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,Levia Draconia,"So to sum this game up:Someone bought some badly copied Jurassic Park models (even with the same sounds) from Turbosquid and threw them on a small map, where the player has to hunt them (or gets hunted).To be honest, the only satisfying thing about this game is, how easily you get achievements. You literally get half of them for just using w, a, s, d, jump, crouch, etc.If the ""dev"" of this game just made this for practice purposes and would have added it for free it would be *okay*. I'm sure there are some people, who enjoy such cheaply made games, but since said person actually charges money for it, there is no way around a negative rating.Also I am not sure, if using said JP models and sounds is even allowed. Highly doubt it is, so I wouldn't be surprised, if this gets taken off of Steam at some point."

I didn't think that would ever happen.This game makes absolutley no sense.You'll find youself thrown into bizarre landscapes where the night sky and stars/moon are shining, yet the landscape is clearly lit by sunlight. There'll be times when it is raining harder than a monsoon, yet the sky will be perfectly clear blue sunshine. The only constant is that you'll be given cryptic instructions in broken ""Russian"" English regarding ""pack of raptors"" being annoyed by your general existance, and slaughering said ""blood suckers"" with whatever random weapons you end up pulling out of a box.(Screenshots here.)When you do manage to get a weapon (this can be anything from a sword and sheild, to an M4-Carbine), you'll be tasked with slaughtering waves of dinosaurs hell bent on eating your face. The AI is incredibly stupid and even if you run out of ammo for your ranged waepons, you can still easilly bludgeon the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to death, and the dinosaurs will explode into a bloody mess of slow motion flying limbs, while you get an achievement.Speaking of achievements, you'll get one for literally everything you'll do. Figure out how to jump? Achievement. Look left? Achievement.♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants? Achievement. It almost feels like the whole game is a participation trophy.Overall, I would say go into this game with the absolute minimum of expectations. If you want a campy, blow 'em up, dino shooter, sure, I'd say at the $0.25 this game is going for is worth it. If you're looking for a serious or super polished game that you can take seriously, I'd say save your quarter.

While killing these dinos and agents, you will come across green bags in which will give you guns or melee weapons. The game is too repetitive and after day 12 its the same thing over n over.

76561198067227433,Not Recommended,506730,29676280,Posted: 3 February,all,courtepattes,"Very crappy game for now. Tons of mindless achievements. A Blood&Bacon-like game without the fun.Why it is so bad:- Completely nonsensical (in one mission you have to gather wood??)- Achievements are NOT FUN. Every dinosaur has a codename such as 7_22 and once you have killed it, you get the corresponding achivement. Which means every kill brings an achievement! It's like a joke which got repeated a hundred times, so that you are sick with it.- Switching between weapons is PAINFUL! Why weapons cannot be assignated to the basic number keys?- You start the mission with very low health so you have to run to the healing point before the wave appear.- This is a wave-based shooter (just like Blood&Bacon). However each wave comes in... waves. So between two such subwaves you are just wanering around.- Shooting at stuff is not fun at all, while it's all the point of the game. Seeing dinosaurs is incredibly difficult. I was aiming with the minimap.What got me satisfied:- No major bug.- You can rebind keys.How could it be improved (it's still Early access):- I'd like to see the dinosaurs before they're eating me.- The ""Grenade"" button does not work, and grenades seem useless anyway.- ""Using"" crates to find more weapons/ammo is horrible. Crates should disappear once the weapon has been looted.- Don't put this ugly message box with the red list of unlocked weapons at the beginning of each wave, it feels crappy.- A better UI. Health should be more visible, just like ammo.- The map is boring.- A cool thing would be to have little quests. Such as ""gather the wood"" so that you can build a fence, then a tower; go destroy that nest of bleeding eggs in that neighboring area, so that you can start purging the planet out of dinos (which seems to be the goal); defend yourself against the waves of angry dinosaurs. Something with quests, upgrades, and coherence. Eventually a world map made of several small areas with different stuff to do in each.- OR make it ""Unlock the achievement"" (that marvelous flash game with an elephant), but it means having real stuff to do, and some funny things to interact with on the map."

,Not Recommended,506730,31811720,Posted: 17 May,all,IAmPattyJack,"Dinosaur Forest is yet another asset riddled horde game that is the same as everything else this developer creates.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeY_fy6LUbUDespite originally being in Early Access this game does nothing to differ itself from the other games released by the same development team. Weapons, game modes, mutators and all other basic mechanics remain from their past games like Blood Feed, Machine Hunt and so on.The gameplay involves multiple horde mode levels across the same map area where you pick up weapons to shoot dinosaurs. The enemies are 90% raptors and all simply run towards you to perform basic attack animations.One of the levels featured no enemies at all and instead had me destroy what I can only assume are supposed to be eggs. I'm not entirely sure if they were though because the textures were broken and bright green.This game is yet another that features hundreds of achievements for no reason beyond enticing achievement hunters. In the time I played I apparently got all but three achievements.If I were to give this game any credit it's that the developer seems to be putting slightly more effort into voiceover work and art than they were with earlier titles. It should be noted that this voiceover and artwork are the only things made specifically for this game, the rest of it is most likely made up of pre-bought store assets.Even for the price there is no reason to recommend Dinosaur Forest.These games are basically just lazy scams that the developer doesn't even try to hide. Anyone with a few hours time and a few dollars could make something very similar. Hell I've made my own asset game in the past just to prove that.If the developer disagrees with me, then feel free to make an actual video game and prove me wrong."

This game will deliver you money's worth, but perhaps not much more.As every other review notes the achievements are a joke, all achieveable within about an hour of gameplay. There are just two maps, and most of your time will be spent on the eecond map. There are weapons to collect and waves of dinos to kill. Sometimes you have to destroy some eggs or collect logs, but mostly it's just killing dinos. Everything is killed very easily and explode in chunks of meat and blood, it's goofy and somewhat unsatisfying... which is a shame because with more satisfying combat and a few more maps this could be a decent game. Maybe that will be added before it exits early access? If so, I will ammend my review.It still gets a thumbs up though since it's worth its price."

We're given low waves of enemies so that we can progress through the story quickly, and the voice acting is a bit better. The hand-drawn art is always nice in these games, though everything else is very bland.It feels like the developer actually tried to make a decent game.

(AFK)","Another dime-o-dozen dollar title from the people who made dinosaur hunter africa something (I think at least) with similar assets, items and engine quality. Mindless shooter with over 300 achievements to be farmed for simply aiming and clicking. Supports steam badge cards. Feels done and tired. Been there and done that already, but in two other games. A robot game like this one exists to make 4 in total.None of them are amazing, but they will make your steam profile look meaty after some grindwork. Nothing great, just a quick afternoon 100% title."

(because it is broken)There is one bad thing for me-The story doesn't matter or make any sense and it has NOTHING to do with the gameAnd here is a trick-1- there is a thing called “God Mode” get this as soon as you can in a round2- then get the super “jump”3- get your hands on one sniper rifle  and two automatic guns4- jump out of the map if you can (about half of the maps are “open world” the other half is over an ocean, you can jump out of the map if it is over the ocean)5- snipe all the little buggers :DAnd so hints-You can't drownIf you have the “jump” you dont take fall damageThe “boss” dinosaurs can be one shot with a sniper rifleJust skip the storySuper speed doesn't work wellSwords are uselessGrenades are fun but not very goodGoats also act as dinosLater on you fight peopleBows aren't very good, just use a gunAll dinos drop-a health pack-a super something-ammo to any and all guns"

,Recommended,506730,30065074,Posted: 20 February,all,Birckk,"Worth it for the achievementsSo if you didn't know. The developer ""Racing Bros"" has made a series of games including this in which you are able to get thousands of achievements in mere hours. The achievements are made so that you'll get achievements from each kill, headshots and some standard achievements etc. All of these games are primarily the same with the exception of the opponents/enemies and maps. To everyone saying these games are good or bad let me state this. These games have a clear purpose and you are either against that purpose or not. The games are what they are, and aren't meant to be some AAA title or anything like that and are not made for the gameplay experience. These games are for having some fun with some bad physics and insane explosions when killing enemies. They aren't meant to be played for a very long time and that's really fair considering the really low price of these games and what the reason to play them are. All in all these games are solely for the achievements and maybe having a small laugh and that's why you should buy this game and nothing else. I personally found the games fun, and they did feel a little grindy of course but nothing I didn't like or mind.You are in a forest with some dinasours. you can get some achievements by killing them what do you do. You kill them and then play something else :)."

Granted, every couple levels you had to either pick up mushrooms or kill ooze for some reason, and pretty much everything died with one hit to the head or 2-3 hits to the body, but hey, let's be honest, you're only buying this game for the achievements anyway, and maybe the cards.The oddest thing about the game was the trees and how the seemed to almost warp into place or something.  It was something I noticed, but it didn't really bother me.Anyway, the game works and is mildly fun, which is more than I can say for a lot of the games on Steam anymore.  If you want to see pretty decent dinosaur models, get 3 cards and over 1k achievements, this game is right up your alley at full price, and a no brainer at 50 cents or even cheaper in the bundle."
