Premise seemed good but when I Started playing it was incredibly frustrating.The biggest issue is that Trump is always shot almost immediately. This is to try and make it more difficult but that means the game is essentially you struggling against the games rampant ragdolling. Basically anything you do and the guy falls down and you have to wait for him to get back up so you can try to get to rump. If you dont start moving as soon as you tap reset you won't have enough time to intercept the bullet. To make this more frustating if you are holding down W when you reset the character won't move until you take your finger off and put it back on.Game is more frustrating than fun.

Nor am I especially left- or right-wing: I prefer to sit on the fence, and see which side makes more sense at any given time. So I won't be reviewing this as a piece of political propaganda (which any fool can see it is). I will instead attempt to review it purely and utterly as a VIDEO GAME, and thereby a piece of entertainment. Deep breath, here goes nuthin'...It's♥♥♥♥♥♥ But kind of amusing for all that.I certainly got a few laughs out of my less-than-thirty minutes of gameplay, after which the ""joke"" grew extremely thin. What's the joke? Well, the joke is that you play an only partially controllable rag-doll variant of Dwayne Johnson (read the Store blurb) who can't even run down two short flights of steps without tumbling head-over-heels.So if you've been hanging out for a far less ""open world""-y version of Goat Simulator with unpredictable physics comparable to Bad Rats, then THIS IS YOUR GAME. Though even you people should probably wait for a price much lower than five bucks, and by the time that happens no one - not even the ""edgiest"" of extreme leftists - will want to buy this game anyway.It's a shame, too, 'cause there's actually a pretty amusing premise here. My advice to the devs: spruce the game up a bit, and add lots of free DLC with OTHER presidential candidates through the ages - both Clintons, Obama, Reagan, the whole ♥♥♥♥ing lot of 'em - and your game might actually have some longevity. Otherwise...a cheap gimmick with a not-so-cheap price-tag.Still, I gotta admit I was curious, and it's hardly the worst $4.79 I've ever spent on Steam. Recommended, but only to those easily amused by farts in bathtubs and/or loudmouthed social justice warriors who want to brag to everyone on Facebook how they've practically overthrown the upcoming ""Trump dictatorship"" by playing a VIDEO GAME.♥♥♥♥♥♥ guess that must put me in the former of those two categories.

This is a poor physics engine driven title using the intentional idea of spoofing the current US president, and as many spoof titles before it, this was nothing more than a lazy cash grab at obvious meme referances so the many internet dwelling social darlings can huehue at trump and whatever nonsense comes with that.Controls are terrible, qwop amounts of bad, as designed but still. Contact and clipping as well as bad hit boxes, mechanics failing to work, the literal map layouts on certain stages are built to be funny and silly, for a gamer like me it is annoying and stupid.

,Recommended,507010,26008552,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,Iron Chef French Hiroyuki Sakai,"This was one of the first games I voted for when Greenlight began, which was around 2012, long before Trump's 2015 declaration that he would seek the presidency of the United States.  The sole premise of the game was to act as a bodyguard to a generic president.  The concept of a game where the player wins by getting shot had a certain appeal to me.  But sadly, the game just rotted in Greenlight for years, and I came to terms with the fact that it would never come out.I don't care what your politics are, but I'm glad that Trump's candidacy, at the very least, gave the developers of this game a catalyst to retool their project into something more marketable.  If you like Trump, you can save his life over and over.  If you don't like Trump, you get to see him killed in a variety of ways.  Everyone goes home happy.  Trump jokes do saturate the game, which probably won't age well and not everyone will find them particularly funny.  The real humor comes from all of the things that go wrong as you play.This is a novelty game, it's easy to compare it to Goat Simulator.  The physics are dubious at their best, and Lovecraftian at their worst.  The presentation is rather bare-bones, the stages are short and lacking in much detail, the game itself isn't terribly long.  The entertainment comes mostly from the surreal nature of the game, and the bizarre things that might happen for inexplicable reasons.  Beating a level is ancillary to experiencing the strangeness.I have a feeling that the devs of this game might not put in the same amount of care and effort as did the the devs of Goat Simulator, as far as updates, additions, or DLC.  If you are reading this, devs, feel free to prove me wrong.  I was one of your first votes, you owe me :P  Perhaps one day a robust modding community will form around this game, and you will be able to take a bullet for any president you like.  It's possible that in the future this game will even allow us to prevent the assassination of America's greatest president, William McKinley.Beyond the surreality, the glitches, and the Trump-specific satire, the game is honestly fun to play.  The basic premise is novel, and it might make you laugh.  It's essentially a puzzle game, the president finds himself in a variety of precarious situations which require the player to employ different strategies in order to save his life.  The game is cheap as it is, but I wouldn't blame someone for waiting for a substantial sale before purchasing.There's also a dedicated front-flip button."

The game clearly drew it's gameplay aspect from Goat Simulator, because the idea the developer must of had is if it looks like a bad game and I market it to be a bad game, no one can leave negative reviews on it, because it's satire.Wrong.  The game took me around an hour and twenty minutes to complete, as well as the wrestling gimmick section and to collect every single achievement. The gameplay gets extremely repetitive, the animations are dreadful, the controls are badly placed as most ""moves"" are done by using 1, 2, 3, etc. The player can easily slip over on surfaces that they shouldn't slip over on, it's just a big buggy mess, but since it's been marketed to be a buggy mess, it'll get good reviews.This is not a good game. When will Valve clamp down on utter crap like this that can just ride through without proper inspection? Don't bother investing your money into this, the developer should just make it free since content in there is clearly not their own anyway.Awful game, keep away from it.(Also, since I finished it in under 2 hours, I'll be getting a refund)"

This is all-in-all an anti-Trump game. The stages are themed in a hyperbolic way of Trump's statements. You're in a stage where Rump builds the wall with confederate flags on stage, a ""bring back torture"" stage, then a stage with the KKK, an anti-women stage and a stage where Mr. Rump becomes a neo-nazi and calls for world war 4 ""Finish what Hitler started.""In the end you build a time machine and you're the one who shoots Mr. Rump.tl;dr this game is made to portray Trump as Hitler.So what do I think of the game?Honestly, I don't care about the developer's political bias, it's just a game.But to charge this much for very little content is a bit dissapointing,considering one of the stages drops to 15fps.How the character controls takes time to get used to, but once you get the hang of it, you'll go through the game without much difficulty.Would I recommend it?I enjoyed playing through it, and I think anyone who has an open mind would as well.For $5, it's not too bad.If it goes on sale for less, I'd easily recommend it.Please add more content, thanks."

You control a secret service body guard named ???? Johnson, his nickname unsurprisingly is Rock-Hard, and you must protect presidential candidate Rump from sniper fire, bombs, and even ninjas. It's a slap-stick physics based game, similar in inspiration to that of Goat Simulator.So far we've had Campaign Clicker, a couple of Make America Great Again games, and a handful of strategy/simulation titles that've been themed after this popular current event. It goes without saying that among all of them, Mr.President! is indeed different. It's actually worth a few laughs over the course of its 10 level career, and there are bonus ""wrestling"" levels where you must elbow drop or headbutt Rump. Luckily what this title brings in humor makes up for the awful controls and terrible ragdoll physics.Each level is an obstacle course of chairs, crumbling pillars, breakable walls, barrels, swinging tampons (yes), and other hazards that you must either bypass or use to your advantage to get to Rump before the bullet does. The controls are... different, and they're both simple and complex. On one side you have your standard WSAD to move, coupled with the spacebar to jump, left mouse button to ragdoll, and right mouse button to slow down time. On the other side, there are a lot of keys that the developer tells you in-game to ""figure out on your own"", ones that will make you backflip, crouch, crawl, dance, shove, and other useful manuvers to move Rump out of the line of certain death.That being said, Johnson will trip over the smallest pebble more often than not, and his arch nemesis are stairs. This leaves you up to your own creative devices in order to get to Rump before the shot is fired, or the bomb explodes; heck, some levels even have you save him from falling tacos and burning crosses. It can be frustrating at times, and it's not a game that everyone is going to be good at. I personally beat the entire campaign and all of the bonus levels in under an hour and a half, and after I got used to the controls and really bad physics, I didn't find much of a challenge to the game.Do not mistake Mr.President! for a pro-(T)Rump game simply because you're repeatedly saving his life. There's a lot of graffiti that supports anti-(T)Rump ideals, and the theme of the campaign gets darker the closer you get to the end; trust me, the end is extremely satisfying for those who do not support this presidential candidate. It starts innocently enough at rallies, and quickly devolves into the anti-abortion, anti-women, KKK, Nazi, pro-nukes, and pro-war topics that have followed (T)Rump's campaign. The game is fun for what it is, but it's also heavily overpriced for its longevity. According to the store page, a portion of the proceeds goes to charity; which one is not included, nor the portion amount. This is really a purchase that's up to the individual, and their political stance. For what it's worth, it's not a terrible physics simulator... but Goat Simulator is so much better.Rating:3.0/5.0- Average, can take it or leave it.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

,Recommended,507010,26402999,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,Turtle1,"This last year has been a sizeable disappointment. Plenty in the way of terrible events, losses, general bad news, and to top it all off an election that will put someone in the white house for the next four years, and no one is particularly excited for any of the candidates.This game is a cathartic bit of satire built into a 'dumb phsyics' game. It's kind of like Postal 2 meets Goat Simulator while being neither of those things. You have to use a barely functional(please note, that's not an insult, it's just the best description) physics system to either hurl your bodyguard character into the path of danger or knock ""Ronald Rump"" to safety. There is also a side-game of sorts where you have to unleash dope wrasslin' moves on Rump, but it's clearly not the focus of the game.The satire is the most standout part of this game, with the level designs going from tongue-in-cheek references to cutthroat political crucifixion, eventually reaching to a bleak representation of the state of the world in four years.The weakest part of the game is the controls, which is to be expected from a dumb physics game. There are a variety of 'secret' controls tied to keys on the keyboard that aren't listed, you just have to press buttons to get the bodyguard to do stuff. Some of it is useful, like a front flip that helps maintain some momentum, or a quick scurry forward on hands and knees to get under low obstacles, and some of it is just elaborate fluff like a ten-second victory animation that if hit prematurely ensures you will not complete the level. There were several points where an obstacle was seemingly unsurmountable was passed again the next time round without changing the approach strategy in the slightest. If that is something that is a deal-breaker, you should probably steer clear.So if you like satire and enjoy dumb physics games, check it out; there are far less-entertaining ways to spend five bucks.And if you want to enjoy the thoughts of people who don't really understand what the first amendment means, feel free to check out the community page; it's pretty magical."

The game was simple enough, with some bits to make it challenging.The good parts are the dark humor and there are multiple ways to save Mr. President. I lost it during the Mexico rally.I did have issues with my finger always resting on the ""R"" key with needing to restart so often at the beginning of the run, that sometimes I ended up restarting instead of continuing just out of muscle memory. The restart is also instant, and if you're holding down a key it won't register as being held. This lead to needing to restart again with the keys off, and I noticed it messed up my mojo.The only real challenge this game provides is trying to use the sometimes clunky physics to your advantage. There were some bugs, mostly issues with falling through the map. On the level with the swinging obstacles I went AFK only to return and the swinging obstacles were stuck in the starting position. This helped tremendously with being able to complete the level, as if it didn't glitch I probably wouldn't have passed it.Overall, the game is worth the few bucks.

,Recommended,507010,33115378,Posted: 1 July,all,RoberTime,"Mr.President! is a politically comedic Unity game based on the likeness of yours truly. The aim of the game is to defend ""Ronald Rump"" from terrorists, most commonly snipers, with a bulletproof bodyguard, the player. It should be known that it is also a Physics game involving thrown objects and ""Ragdolling"" yourself in order to clear specific tasks.Each level serves as a ""Scene"" with Rump about to get killed and the bodyguard player spawning in a position. You must race and overcome obstacles in order to push Rump out of the way before he gets sniped, or falling into another form of death occasionally. The game spans 10 chapters each with 4-8 scenes in them. What I really like about each chapter is the different settings and themes they went for. You have areas like the Mexican Border, a meeting with a Putin counterpart (Named ""Rutin""), and even a KKK rally.Now for nitpicking, you can see the game appears rushed and/or buggy, as there are many things wrong with it. Especially when it comes to Physics games seeing how the physics tend to be pretty wonky at times. Also some of the level designs are pretty annoying, requiring precision and sometimes heavy luck. Perhaps the worst part of the game is one later scene from the Russia chapter. Another thing too is a performance issue. Even at lowest graphics settings, my laptop overheated until I realize I could set to Power Saver and play the game from there.However, most of the frustration in the game is snubbed by the entertainment this game offers. In most cases you have something you find so hilarious that you don't mind resetting over and over just to see it again, or for me at least. I'm sure a few others will see it that way too.There are also other minigames to go with it, but I haven't played them yet, as I only passed the full main game. I'm pretty sure it won't need any major explanation anyway.Overall, the game is *just* okay. The concept is awesome, but half of gameplay isn't really. It would've been better if it was polished more and if the graphics issue was more optimized, but still, okay. 6/10"

I wondered how they could really improve it or why you would take it off the market and change it up. Now I know, it was to make the generic president Donald Trump.This is funny for about two or three missions, I like the funny touches like his wig flying off when he's shot and the headlines about him being a 'failed businessman' it's quite funny and informed but at first it just feels like the same game with a different coat of paint. Like this is the 'Donald Trump' edition of an already established game.Fortunately it's a little more than that, there's more challenges and different set ups, some of them are pretty funny, like you have to save Trump from being crushed by a giant taco but again, the novelty of these set ups quickly wears off because of the frustrating nature of the game design. If you touch anything, you fall over. You can't even walk down a flight of stairs or touch SAND without falling over.Don't get me wrong, I get the idea, well, I don't really but I understand that's how they wanted the game to be but that doesn't make it good. It makes it really difficult and frustrating on the harder puzzles, becasue the physics engine keeps spazzing out and you keep failing over and over again as the game becomes more and more unforgiving. It would also be nice if they told you what all of the buttons did from the outset, sadly you don't get this luxury, it would be nice if you were told about the 'E' 'flip' command before the idiotic donkey kong level that it was introduced in.Before this was a fun little freebie game and if that fun little freebie game still existed I'd probably have a more positive feel towards this game but it was all but destroyed to make way for this and it's... I don't think it's good enough to sell on the steam store. Granted I've played WORSE but I think this needs a lot of work before I can even call it good.It's a laugh, the price isn't robery but I still think this should be free as once it gets frustrating all of it's charm is pretty much lost. If you can get it in the sale for £1 or under, then great but otherwise, I'd wait for future updates or just avoid this, you aren't missing too much."

In the third (or is it fourth?) mission you have to ""catch a bullet"" by jumping in front of the sniper laser fire. The problem is that you have to be super precise with this buggy Unity guy or the bullet will hit Rump and force you to restart. The chapters are insanely short (three 15 second missions in the first chapter) as well. Not to mention that it seems like the missions in Chapter 3 aren't even in the right order (the tutorial mission for front flips happens after a mission that really used front flips) and the 3rd mission in Chapter 3 is literally just saving Rump from tacos that spawn directly above him out of your field of view without any warning. Also, if you actually succeed in the mission but hit ""R"" to restart it, there is no way to proceed without doing it over again.If you want to see how little effort was put into this game, here's a few screenshots I took.

When you start and fail you quickly realize that you need to start moving the second you respawn. So you tend to do things like hold down W to start running right away but once you respawn you have to press W again because if you hold W nothing happens and it really feels like you need that tiny little second to make a difference. When you get farther and face harder challenges you fail 20 times in a row and respawn in this life death cycle that is so fast that its almost like your music is skipping and repeating the same 2 second part over and over and over again. except its not even music its a crowd cheering. It starts to drive you crazy.There is a mission where you have to jump over barrels. The jump has to be timed to perfection or you trip. It is so absurdly difficult to get this jump that the cycle of sound I was talking about earlier makes you return the game... Cause that's what happened to me.With all of that being said I think they had a funny idea. if they focused on the gameplay and making it more fun than a hyper difficulty thing this wouldn't be bad for 5 dollars. I honestly thought the political jokes they were trying to make were pretty bad. Kinda wish the game was about protecting nameless politicians and make jokes about the government in general. Just so much more to make fun of than just one♥♥♥♥♥hole. but the jokes were all just the backdrop of the game and some of them were just really not to my personal liking.

Simply saying, ""♥♥♥♥ the Xbox One, mother ♥♥♥♥ers trying to rob me.""Now this is his only game. This is somewhat confusing to me, so a person who hasnt tweeted or deleted many tweets for 3 years, suddenly put out an extremely political game, with seemingly no hopes to make any other game, despite the financial success of this one. It simply does not make sense and I am sure I am not the only one to bring this up. Maybe there is a reasonable and obvious answer to this but there isnt ont as of now.Based on what I just told you, please fact check me, and make your own conclusion.(P.S. I did not make a conclusion in this review because it only has circumstancial evidence and I do not want to create a bias for what the reader will conlude.)"

,Recommended,507010,28625794,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Draggo,"3.3 hrs during this review, only that much and I have played every single thing this game has to offer. Also got all of the achievements.That is a bit sad, but I personally enjoyed it, despite spending probably 2 hours alone struggling with only 5 or so levels, this game will anger you to the point you will question whether or not some of these levels are broken, but timing everything right, and discovering some glitches you can get past everything I promise. Sure this game is broken, it is also youtube fodder, and a cheap cash in on the newest meme that is the president. It would be a negative for me if it weren't for the fact it does not try to be serious in any manner.The only time you should ever buy this game is during a sale, because really when you stop and think about it; it is just a mobile ragdoll game in a sense. So only paying $2 for it like I did would be worth it, and you will get over $2 of enjoyment. I might possibly play this again, considering the wrestling levels were pretty funny, and this game has a lot of references that I can grab.This game is not without its bugs, some of the levels are so broken that you literally have to pull off some serious voodoo magic to get past some of the levels. One in particular I had to exploit a glitch where you can alter the direction of your dive using the slow motion feature to jump, and then turn to knock the president out of the way. This probably took at least 30 minutes to figure out and also time it JUST right. This made me so angry. If you anger easily, this game will destroy you.To recap, if you like silly ragdoll games that are sometimes excruciatingly hard and will leave you playing it non-stop until you beat the level, this game is definitely for you. If you like immature humor and silly references, this game is for you. If you say no to any of these things, then I would suggest to find something else."

The short version: It's worth the $5 or whatever I just spent on this thing.Ok, so as the other reviews will tell you, yes the controls are wonky. But it's supposed to be. I mean, you're a breakdancing body guard who's hurling himself across a map to tackle president ""Rump"". It's a rediculous game, but it's good at being rediculous. It's South Park kind of rediculous (but not South Park kind of funny). The developer knew what he was going for. And the wrestling side-game is amazing.There are some bugs that I think should be sorted out though. On the last stage when you're tackling metal Rump, your body will sometimes just lock in place in mid-air when something loads in. I can forgive most bugs, but I can't forgive the ones that make you stop dead in your tracks and start a level over. Also, if you could throw in some cheats or something for completing the game (fly around, have a gun, some sh*t like that) instead of just resetting the whole timeline (I'm going to be devil's advocate and assume you're making fun of No Man's Sky with that. And yeah, it's just as annoying) then I'd probably come back to it. Something else that I think would be cool is a create-a-level for the wrestling games. That'd be legit.But as it stands right now, it's beaten, I don't want to beat it again, and I'm moving on.Other than the minor flaws it's well worth it. I'd say get it if you're just looking for a timewaster."

In lieu of these physics, your character simply ragdolls upon doing absolutely anything, including jumping, touching a staircase, bumping into a wall, or even doing the ""funny"" animations that are included for absolutley no reason. The game becomes a strugle to flail your way over to ""Rump"" who clearly wasn't inspired by anything in the real world, and push him over before he gets sniped, or a bomb goes off. Again, the ""physics"" implimented on Rump means sometimes he literally does not move when you tackle him. I've had his legs fly up like he's suspended by his head instead of falling like he should, and this always gets him killed. Or, maybe not, as this game is programmed so poorly sometimes I've found that the assassin doesn't even hit his target when whatever he, or Rump, is standing on crumbles to dust beneath their feet. Oh, forgot to mention that. Everything you step on disentigrates. Bridges and pillars appear to be made out of sand. All in all, this game was NOT fun, it certainly wasn't ""funny"", and remains one of the worst things I've ever played, on Steam, or anything else."

You play as a constantly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d bodyguard who breaks his legs every time he so much as turns around too fast as you try to protectDonald TrumpRonald Rump, a♥♥♥♥♥♥yellow mannequin wearing a suit, from multiple assassination attempts in different parts of the world, with an anti-Trump message that's about as subtle as an axe through a door. While the game may be frustratingly difficult or repetetive or both to some people, I personally always find some form of enjoyment out of every level.Pros:The whole idea is actually patriotic as ♥♥♥♥.The ragdolls combined with the wonky physics engine of Unity make for great screenshots.Cons:The controls, while still usable for the most part, are slightly delayed, while the other moves have an even longer delay.While this is likely intentional,TrumpRump's overall appearance makes me want to vomit."

I played for a while, beating all of the little bonus wrestling missions, and about 4 regular chapters. It was fun until the level design made it so that the game sometimes decided to destroy parts of the path you needed to progress. Not that it mattered much anyway; the game gives you barely enough time to reach a big board between you and Mr Rump, and it doesn't knock him over. This means you don't have enough time to knock the board down on his head, get up, and actually knock him over. On top of that, the physics of diving are not consistent, and ""physics objects"" don't really behave at all. I know it's a satire and I know it costs $6, but in the end, the inconsistencies and ridiculous difficulty curve make the game not really that worth it. Go watch your favorite YouTube personalities play it."

Sometimes you go flying to the moon, sometimes your character has a seizure and falls a foot infront of him.The levels themselves get progressively worse. One level you have to perform entirely in slow motion, because the platform you run on collaspes for no reason, so you have to Legolas that and jump as it's falling. Another level you have to protect ""Rump"" from falling tacos.

If you love Trump, you can save his life.There are 9 chapters, 4 wrestling levels, and 1 final challenge.The game is short and a quick play, but can be replayed more than once.The ragdoll physics make for some great laughs and hilarious antics.The objects that will break if you touch them or will knock you over aren't very obvious, but that doesn't really make it much harder.There sadly is no level editor, but we can hope for Workshop in the future.For $5.00 ($4.79 on sale at time of review), this game is worth the hour or two of fun and humor. It might be seen as a final cashgrab within the last month of the election, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth it.It uses the WASD format for movement, spacebar for jumping, R for Retrying the level, and 1 - 2 -3 - 4 - 5 - 6 -7 -8 -9 all having their own animations and E for backflipping.Hasn't crashed once and runs smoothly, with only a second or two of delay here and there.If you've got the cash lying around and nothing better, this is certainly worth the purchase. It's not the kind of game you should go out of your way to find and purchase when there's others you might want to get to first, but don't forget it all together.7.5 / 10"

It is extremely humorous in terms of gameplay, there sheer insanity of the ragdoll physics one must employ to save the day is maddening on multiple levels, and after the humor turns into determination, that's when you know the game got you. That was about half way through for me, it was a love hate relationship that kept me going until the end, and when the game threw me a few bones in terms of difficulty variation and what would be called filler, I had a better appreciation for this.Definitely much more difficult than the initial release, there's many puzzles that require rather unintuitive means of completion, like using a ramp of barrels to launch one's self onto a raised platform. I had spent several hours trying to take the more obvious step route, but it didn't offer enough time for navigation or recovery, so more hours were spent with blind trajectory launches until luck favored me.As painful as the experience was, I laughed a lot, and...appreciated the messages."

But besides that its an ok game with some huge flaws.4+ hours in7/10Pros:Level design gets the point acrossCharacter designs are quite over exaggeratedStory mode is interestingStory mode is quite challenging at timesAs you progress in the story, you will find new stuff laying around your roomGame isn't afraid to poke around sensitive subjects and make fun of it2 other modes for varietyPokes fun at how the media over exaggerates thingsPokes fun at Donald Trump and his politcal viewsCons:Invisible barriers plague the gameCharacters are quite clunkyCharacters are quite clumsyNeeds some more polishLevels look a bit blandNothing really looks blended inGame looks like a mod for gary's modGame is shortConclusion:I would slightly recommend it only to experience how absurd this game is. We need more games like this that isn't afraid of displaying a political message or trying to make fun of it."

On the one hand I did enjoy it and spent a while playing it. On the other, the game is an utterly broken mess....The purpose is to smack into your target before a bullet or bomb does but to do this you have to break the games physics. The physics are so woefully inconsistent that you'll find yourself repeatedly trying to break it in the same way to succeed. It's like when you found a glitch in your favorite game that you spent hours trying to exploit perfectly for fun... only this time it's required to beat the game.In conclusion a mildly fun but broken game that belongs in the $1.99 price point instead of $4.99"

,Recommended,507010,26121955,"Posted: 19 October, 2016",all,Wrathpulse,"It is a puzzle ragdoll physics game where you're a bodyguard, tasked with defending ""Ronald Rump"" from various threats, from snipers to Scorpion from Mortal Kombat lookalikes.  Clearly referencing the presidential candidate Donald Trump, you may think at first glance, that since you have to save him all the time, it was made for people who like the man. You'd be wrong. Dead wrong. As the game progresses you'll witness progressively worse nightmare scenarios based on Trump's quotes and controversies.Silly and disturbing at times, the ragdoll physics provide some funny moments. Thing is, the physics themselves allow for some really frustrating moments as your character may flail about in the exact wrong direction even though you had the right intention. Besides, I didn't even laugh that hard at any point during the game. Your mileage may vary here.A big issue I have with the game is where it resets your entire progress in the story mode when you finish it. Which is awful because I don't want to have to endure 3 or 4 frustratingly bad puzzles to replay one or two levels I may have found amusing.Update: With the new update, you're once again in control of Donald Rump, where you now have to wrestle, roundhouse kick those ""bad hombres"", the immigrants and refugees.I have to admit, I actually laughed out loud quite a few times with the absurdity of a fat orange wig man rotating like a ballerina as random people, even kid characters, are being projected to oblivion.Should the game continue to be updated as Trump's presidency goes on, this could turn out to be quite a fun little game, and I now recommend this game, seeing as it manages to still be relevant after the election, unlike all the other Trump games out there. Pleasantly surprised."

Way to go guys, giving a bad game positive reviews because it has ""le funney trump maymays"" in it. You're all so hilarious. Without his likeness in the game, no one would have known it existed.When I purchased this game, I expected a funny, silly, casual experience with buggy physics as its punchline. Unfortunately the controls are so bad that it butchers the entire experience. I can appreciate a ""joke game"" every once and a while, but this game has had absolutely no effort put in to it. The fact that people give this developer money is sad... There are much better, less known indie titles that deserve a lot more praise, and this guy makes a garbage, broken, buggy, low effort game and gets tons of cash from it.Please do not buy this game. It's not fun, it's not funny, and the developer doesn't deserve your money. It's a fundamentally broken game."
