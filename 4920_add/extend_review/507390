,Not Recommended,507390,25031328,"Posted: 20 August, 2016",all,Miss Stormkast,"Beautiful idea, but poorly executed.Gone In November is basically a walking simulator where you progress through the story by reading. It wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if it wasn't for the presentation of said reading material.The dialogue segments are confusing, as it's not always clear who is saying what or in what context. The worst part is that there are moments when there's just too much (non-proofread) text scattered over the screen, poorly placed and often overlapping. Try to follow the story and make sense of a screen filled with vague, seemingly randomly placed text, all being about different things and disappearing as you read. The game basically tells you in the beginning that you should screenshot when needed, but that should not be necessary. You shouldn't ever have to tab out of a game every few minutes to read from a screenshot to be able to follow the story, especially not when said game is based around reading and wants to play on your emotions.This lazy choice of stressed story presentation does nothing to make you get to know the characters, and thus as you progress, you wonder why you would care emotionally about these people or their fates. And there goes the whole meaning of the game.While the soundtrack is nice and atmospheric, the visuals aren't. It's a 1 dollar game, but making a cheap game doesn't mean you have to make the game look cheap.There clearly was a good thought behind this, but it did not transfer well into the game."

I do not mind text based games- but the text itself is confusing and often overlaps onto itself- I also had difficulty understanding who was saying what. It felt difficult to understand and a bit nonsensical if you moved too quickly and had text overlapping on text and scattered test on the grounds.It's difficult to say that I recommend this game in its state since the pricing is about what I expected for this type of game with a lack of visual presentation.Pros:+ Cheap, Cheap, Cheap+ Good Concept, Difficult Subject+ Runs Well, No Crashing ( Functions )+ Decent WritingCons:+ Confusing Narritive Presentation+ Lack of Visuals+ Overlapping text ( where text is not suppose to overlap )+ Some spelling errors+ Issues with hitbox on pills in kitchenConclusion: If you feel like spending 30 minutes reading a narritive that is semi-difficult to understand but has some heart behind the writing- feel free to spend a $0.84 on it. I didn't feel like it added anything to my life, personally, so I cannot recommend it."

A good example is Emily is Away but I got this and I extremely don't like it. First off the story is REALLY complicated in all honestly, There isn't much story in general, The whole time I sorta thought, man when he wakes up from this drug dream he'll go to his computer and message this girl he loves and an actual story will start, not just background and telling how depressed he feels.The part where you're introduced to killing himself or to keep going I thought it was going to get intresting, I thought if I choose Keep going I'll keep going through a cooler story, one that happens in the present, but no, the game just ends thereThe game also likes to do these random jump scares to make it seem indie and cool but its really just frighting and off point,mostly getting hit by the truck one that made no sense what so everIn the end I don't recommend this game at all, It seems to be made by a sixteen year old cringy indie and super edgy game developer. It also has a ton of inaccurate things and every single graphic is completely just reused a ton of the time. Save the dollar but most important, the time."

The idea behind it was captivating, however the game failed to execute it well, and just when I thought the story was getting goingThe part where you get to choose to kill yourself or keep going, it ended abruptly and left me disappointed. For £0.67 I can't complain too much, however if I were you I'd keep the £0.67 and keep looking for a better game of this style."

It's a couple of minutes of poorly written sentences that fails to make sense of the story - in Segoe Script no less, so good luck reading it. There are also times where the developer punishes you for having installed it on your SSD by showing some text for about two seconds before it disappears.Didn't hit me hard in the wallet, but I think buying some bread and feeding it to some local ducks would have been a more fulfilling experience for the same amount."

I finally bought it during the holiday sale 2016 and started it yesterday. To be honest the game was not what I expected it to be... It was really short but too long for a healthy person. I don't know what depression feels like but this was enough for me to state that I don't want to ever know. It is slow and after the first minute you start to become as shiftless as the protagonist.I guess the whole game tries to pull you down to a level where you can feel what a depressed person might feel and that you try to understand what that whole illness is about. Of course I chose the (in my opinion) good door but in the end I was alone with a subdued feeling that I can do nothing.Thank you for pulling me down ;)"

It's short, has terrible graphics, and is the very definition of a walking simulator with very little interaction. But I liked it. I enjoyed the message it was trying to deliver (though it is a little convoluted) and expressed it in a few experimental and interesting ways. One aspect I really liked was how the dialouge and the characters thoughts would pop up on screen but as you walked further more and more text would pop up clouding the screen in disturbing thoughts and misunderstood perceptions. I was frantically trying to read them all, but as I tried to read them others would disapear and others would appear before I could fully grasp them. I don't know if this was intentionally trying to create that sense of mental bombardment we can sometimes go through, but I found it pretty effective. Overall it's a short experience that costs less than a dollar. It has no replayability but leaves you thinking about it afterwords. I enjoy this ""short story"" type gaming and I hope to see more of it. If you're looking for a short and semi-interesting experience that's worth every one of your 84 cents (but not much more), this is your game."
,Not Recommended,507390,25957330,"Posted: 9 October, 2016",all,BlackRockShadow,"I purchased this game, because it was only $1, and looked pretty interesting.  The mixed reviews threw me off, but I went for it anyways, since it's been on my Steam Wishlist for about a month now.In Gone in November, you play the role of a man who is about to die, and you see fragments of his memory as he dies.  It sounds really sad, and admitedly, it is sad, but the game doesn't really do a whole lot with it's premise to make the themes it presents powerful.  At the end of the game, you pretty much have more questions, then you do answers, and a good chunk of the story is vague.Gameplay is your standard walking simulator title, and it does everything pretty well.  No real complaints in that department.  The soundtrack is fitting, and I actually quite like it.  The soft, sad-sounding music is fitting for this game, and the themes it attempts to tackle.Graphically, the game looks pretty solid for a 3D indie title.  Unfortunately, the game tries to fit your monitor on startup, instead of giving you an option to adjust the game yourself.  There's an easy way around this, using Notepad, but it's frustrating it wasn't included in the final product.The game is also exceptionally short, with my playtime being around 20 minutes.  With this game being $1, I expected it to be short, but it felt a bit too short for my taste.I wouldn't recommend Gone In November, unless it's at least 50% off.  It's not an absolutely awful experience, but it felt like the game didn't last long enough to make an impact.Pros:+ Solid graphics.+ Controls work exceptionally.+ Great soundtrack.Cons:- Story is lacking, and doesn't use it's themes to it's full potential.- No way to manually change resolution, unless you adjust a file with Notepad.- Very short (20 minutes of gameplay)Final Rating: 5/10"

After playing it however I came away very disappointed. Nothing about this game whatsoever has any positive merits. The story is almost non-existent, confused and underdeveloped, never once grabbing the player’s attention or imagination. The level design and graphical elements also fall very flat, even for a cheap little indie game. Plus there are some noticeable texture flickering and other issues. And worst of all the text within the game is not only trying too hard to be deep with no actual meaning, but it is blatantly obvious that it hasn't even been proofread.Overall Gone In November is an amateur, underdeveloped game that I would not recommend to even the most die-hard of story-based gaming/walking simulator fans."

Gone in November's a short game: in the first half you're wandering through a house completing some quotidian tasks (that basically consist of clicking on things). In the second half, it devolves into a sparse ""dream world"" where you walk down a path marked out for you and read short messages that pop up.  It's supposed to be about the story unfolding over the course of the game but, as other reviewers have noted: (a) some of the messages are compromised by bad grammar and (b) with the pieces your given the details of the story remain vague and confusing [this part's a little spoilery] you're a sick man? you broke up with your girlfriend who something was wrong with her? someone was in a car accident? did one of you move to Vietnam?Basically, this feels unfinished, it's mostly a walking simulator, there is some interesting food for thought but the deeper story about illness, depression, ? isn't delivered clearly enough to realy hit the mark.One of the biggest pros people give is ""well it's cheap,"" but even so I'm not sure how well spent my time playing this game was."

However, the spelling and grammar mistakes took me out of the story, and the 20 minute run time of the game left something to be desired. A line here and there registered somewhere in the empathetic portions of my brain, but far too many lines and phrases landed in the eye roll catagory.The imagery and level design was better than what I expected. However I would not go as far as to call it inspired or particularly thought provoking. Not a bad first attempt, should this game be that, but not anything close to memorable.Sell some trading cards and pick it up if the game seems interesting to you, but don't expect more than a bite-sized experience that will leave little to no lasting impact on the player.(Just go play The Beginner's Guide or the Stanely Parable again. Much better use of your time.)"

There were moments in the game that the writing in it was not legible and some of the sentences felt like they weren't even proof read. A minor thing that bothered me thought was that the ""I's"" in the game werent capitalized when they should be. Either way it is a cheap game but it just feels unfinished and there is no backstory to this when there should be especially because itjust mentions a ""her"" in the story. There is no info about ""her"" in the game and it just says they haven't spoken to her, is she a friend? a sister? mom? For all we know it could be a teacher.Another issue is that there was moments in the game when there was just to much on the screen were it would have to be screenshoted to be able to read which is why I'm assuming it tells you the screenshot button in the beginning. Yes this game is worth slightly under a dollar which means I shouldn't be expecting much but still there should be more background info like I've tried stating previously. IMO the game is too short, first play through trying to read everything came out to be barely over 20 mins. This game feels like it does have a connection to the other game ""The Static Speaks My Name"" or something like that as there are similarities to it."

Very short, I finished it in about 10 minutes. The topics presented are deep, personal, and for some, very relatable. For me indeed. The story is straightforward, part of it can be interpreted, though. Essentially it’s the story of a man who has a form of cancer, presumably lung cancer, based on the cigarette seen on the livingroom table. You control this unnamed main character through his journey. Not a lot is presented, and the information the player receives is through reading. The player can infer that the main character is dying, very quickly. He goes through his final moments remembering the good and the bad times throughout his life. If you haven’t already assumed - this is a very depressing game. I’m depressed just writing this review. I didn’t cry, but there’s deep, sad feeling, which will linger for a while. This game reminds us of things we often forget. That’s all there’s to say about this. The graphics aren’t anything special, they weren't the priority however. The story is engaging, incredibly sad; I found myself smiling at the things I read, and I found myself nearly crying because of the things I read.

There are sprawlings all over the floor throughout the game, but it really doesn't add up to much in terms of a story.If you're full of self-pity and want validation, then maybe this is the game for you.

But after finishing this game, I was very disappointed. I don't know if I can be disappointed at a £0.79 game, but I was. Here's why.The whole game is confusing and strange. It starts off fairly simple, just you completing tasks. The entire game is walking and reading text. But when you enter the ""memory fragments"" it starts to fall apart. I'm good at making lists, so I'll pro and con this.Pros -+ Cheap price!+ Good musicCons -- The game was confusing. Especially the text sections. The game tells you to screenshot, but that should not be necessary. Throughout the entire game, I had no idea who was who, who was saying what, what was happening, I didn't know anything. There is definite potential here, but the text often overlapped, and it often didn't give you time to read it all. Text was everywhere, and it was super confusing. There are plenty of sequences such as where you get hit by a truck, I had no idea what was going on there.- Sound design issue. One issue I noticed is where when you are in the computer if you press WASD you hear footstep sounds.- Sentence errors. There were some spelling mistakes and some sentences made no sense.- Ending. (SPOILERS!) At first I picked the ""die"" option, and I was suprised to find that the game ended there. Who was the person knocking at the door? I have no idea. I even went back through the entire game to try and grasp the story a bit better and to pick the other option. I thought the story was going to get interesting, but no. It just ended. Very poor.In conclusion, no, I would not reccomend this game. It has great potential, but because of the confusing narrative and impossible to grasp story, this is not a good game."

It isn't even really a ""story"" in that the narrative is minimal and non-linear.  You barely interact with the environment (other than walking).  It is somewhat of a spiritual cousin to Dear Esther, but only in tone.All of that said, it is an interesting work that can provoke some thought on mortality and life.  The visuals, while basic, are done artfully and enhance the mood.Think of Gone in November as more of a short visual poem than a game or even a walking-simulator.  It is meant to set a mood and get you to think and--if you are open to this type of experience--it does so pretty well."

It tries to be a deep and meaningful story about illness and depression (which, for the record, is what I hoped it would be), but it fails to deliver anything beyond nonsensical ramblings.  I'd like to say I believe the disorienting, schitzophrenic nature of the game was intentional, but I feel like that would giving this game way too much credit.  What you really get here is a humdrum walking simulator of the worst kind - full of pretentious ideas, but executed so poorly you're not left with anything to take away from the experience.  There are a few unsettling moments, but they feel rather obligatory and sprinkled in just to give you something to make this a memorable experience.  On the plus side you can get this game for less than the cost of a soda, and you can complete it in less time than it would take to drink that soda, but I didn't find anything to make this worthwhile even for the most curious of gamers."

The problem with this game is that there are so many bugs and bad translations that it is difficult to understand the full story or even most of it. I got the Collector's Edition content (because it was so cheap why not). In the content it offers a little bit of info that helps explain the endings.The bugs include how the loading screens show some fragments of memories through text but there isn't a full list anywhere and some of the screens load so fast you can't actually read anything. The translation is ok but it is bad in certain areas which confused me while I was trying to understand and follow the story. There are certain things that just don't make sense throughout the game that you have to put the pieces together as you go. But for me the biggest problem is the days hint at the story but nothing really lays out what is going on and why. This might just be a bad translation issue but I think it also is an incomplete game. For these reasons I'm going to say don't buy it. If you're going through a rough time and need help then find a support group or a phone number to call but if you're hoping this game will help you relate to what you're going through and help you feel better, it won't."
