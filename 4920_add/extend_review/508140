,Not Recommended,508140,28881251,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,oposdeo,"A great representation of the toxic sludge flooding Steam's page from Greenlight. It uses ""randomness"" and ""memes"" to get itself recognized, the two forms of humor that anyone can pull off with no effort, that lack any form of artistic merit or wit, and then it uses cheap pricing and trading cards to churn out a quick buck. No effort was put into this product, and buying it will help support more games like this to pop up on this store page and make money. I got it expecting a game so bad it was good, but it turned out to just be unfunny and boring.ProsI personally found one of the scenes kind of funny, maybe you will also find a funny scene.Some level of production value in the theme songYou can get trading cards and Steam XP from it. BUT, keep in mind that trading wallpapers, emotes and cards from this game are giving these lazy kids money. You are rewarding them for doing this.You can gift it to a friend and they will produce some kind of lukewarm reaction that you will find mildly amusing.You can click to skip the cutscenes!!!!ConsThere is no options menu for things such as full screen or volumeYou can play through every single cutscene the game has in under a half hour, even for this price it is too short.The only gameplay besides selecting from multiple text boxes are a ""point and click adventure"" including four total clicks before you have clicked everything, and a fake phone/PC that appears to have features, such as a minecraft executable or a web browser, but it usually just railroads you down one path or displays a lol-so-random error message. They couldn't be bothered to actually put anything interesting in it, which wouldn't have really been that hard.All of the art assets appear to be shoddy mspaint drawings, I wouldn't be suprised if it took under an hour to make them all.On the virtual computer you can navigate to steam and watch the trailer for another of their awful games, Kimulator. The trailer is incredibly long, bad, and boring, but it does appear to have some actual (really awful looking but still functional) first person shooter gameplay. This game is just clicking and watching videos. It's like being in the lowest levels of hell, and being teased with a slightly higher but still excrutiating level of hell.The settings for the cutscenes appear to be random street corners and buildings within the general vicinity of their house. The supposed plot for this game is that they are some of the few survivors of some zombie meme-pocalypse, but when you can hear the sounds of children playing in the park near where they are filming, it really doesn't convey the feeling of ""apocalypse."" It more just feels like some awkward kids running around the park and being weird while filming it.The plot, obviously, is the kind of nonsense some kid in middle school might write during a math class instead of doing their work. They thought of the first thing that came to mind, filmed one take of it, and then loaded it into their game. Repeated this about 20 times and then stuck it on steam. It was probably done in a day, with no real interest in making any of it entertaining or compelling. If you want to film yourself being a socially awkward person, you can do so, but instead of putting it on youtube where people will dislike and call you names, put it on steam where you will make lots of money and be praised for memes.The choices you make in the story are all completely random and have no indication of whether it will kill you or progress the plot. You just pick one and hope you don't have to start all over again.There, as far as I could tell, are no branching endings. The choices you make do not matter, besides some of them making you start over.They decided to bank on the ""one take"" philosophy, so every single shot is unprofessional, unfunny, poorly executed and unimmersive. Go goof around with your real friends instead of watching these people do it, you will have more fun.A large part of this game's appeal, the memes, are stale. We get it, Gaben and Half Life 3, hilarious and original.The description states that there are ""puzzle elements to keep your brain entertain."" Sadly there are no puzzles, and my brain was not entertain.It costs the price of two chocolate bars. You will be much happier with the chocolate bars.Whenever you die there is a fairly lengthy and boring unskippable cutscene.The theme song is repeated at least 3 times other than the title screen, so it gets old.CONCLUSIONPeople are going to buy this anyways because it has meme emoticons and is cheap. They are also going to write positive reviews because they are looking for those juicy meme points. There is no hope, there is no god, the meme-pocalypse is real and its taking us down with it."

,Not Recommended,508140,25973066,"Posted: 10 October, 2016",all,Mellow_Online1,"I just want to disclose (primarily to the company) that I'm aware I don't have that high of rep with them after some words were exchanged between me and them . I just want to say that the current relationship between me and the dev is in no way going to affect my opinion of this product, I'm here to review a game, not the company. They could tell me repeatedly that this is the same game as the one that was greenlit and I still wouldn't believe them.However, despite the relationship in question not affecting my opinion of the game, some of you will probably be aware I didn't like this studio's first game ""Kimulator: Fight For Your Destiny"" and to this date, I still believe it to be one of the worst games on Steam. Now my opinion of Zombitatos is a bit different to my opinion of Kimulator. There are parts of which Zombitatos improves on Kimulator and there are also parts of it which make it worse.Gameplay is probably the worst part of Zombitatos, Zombitatos consists of 1 point and click segment which is about 5 minutes long and then the entirety of the 15 minutes of other gameplay is simply choosing from a list of choices to make. And yes, you heard me right, this game is only 20 minutes long. That means you can play it, see everything and still get a refund for the game for the £1.59 price tag on it. Say whatever you want about Kimualtor, at least it had more overall content than what Zombitatos has and it also had more variety, which is bad for a game that seems to promote it's self of being a ""choices matter"" game. The choices in the game consist of only 1 right choice and then the rest of the choices just lead to death and you have to sit throught these painful FMV segments over and over again, just to get back to your original point. Also, like I said before, the game only has 1 point and click segment and your only goal is to go into a room and pick up your password for your computer. BMC, a bit of advice, if you're going to make a point and click adventure game, add more point and click segments, what you have is a game with 1 point and click segment and the rest of it is a visual novel with some really bad jokes. The jokes are both bad and forgetable, and like what happened in Kimulator, an offensive joke is put in saying that at least their game was ""better than 9/11."" I'm not sure if it's just my style of humour or if people actually find that sort of thing funny, but I fail to see how 9/11 is funny, I also fail how to see how the holocaust is funny.Also, even though you're making a comedy game, you still have to have some sort of actual logic to apply to what it is you're creating. Like I said before, you have to choose from different options and only 1's right and the others lead to death. Basically, because of the lack of logic shown to you of what might actually work, it's nearly impossible to get through the game without getting something wrong.For example, one of the choices was ""Sleep"" or ""head to a gaming convention"" At the beginning of the game, it's revealed by the narrator that it's gamers that are affected by the zombie apocalypse. So by normal logic, the gaming convention would be a bad idea because it would be full of gamers (zombies) but gues what? That's actually the right choice. Sleeping, an innocent need that you have to fulfill leads to death, however heading to the outside of a gaming convention, possibly full of zombies/gamers leads to success. That's what I'm meaning about applying logic to your game, you need to actually have reasons of why this would occur in the world you're actually trying to create. If you're aiming to create a comedy point and click game, then do soemthing like what game slike Day of the Tentacle, Grim Fanfango and the Secret of Monkey Island did, create bizarre solutions to the puzzles that make you laugh, not necessarily laugh out loud but so that the writing of the puzzle is clever enough for you to maybe chuckle a bit. The issue that Zombitatos has is that the humour is forced and unfunny and always has a confusing centerpieces of the humour it's self and the only puzzle of the game is literally going into a room and picking up your password.One thing that I'll give Zombitatos over Kimulator however is that it's at least consistant (or at least more consistant) than what Kimulator did and I believe that this is due to the decision to make the game entirely FMV instead of cutting to FPS moments. Now this decision has both good and bad things to it though. The thing with Kimulator is that the FPS segments was basically the only form of slight entertainment in the game. With Zombitatos, despite it being more consistant, is much more boring. At least in Kimulator you were actually doing things, Zombitatos is basically just a huge bore-fest.The one full praise that I'll give Zombitatos however, is the main theme. It's annoyingly catchy and I couldn't get it out of my head, so music is pretty decent in it.Overall, Zombitatos is an unfunny, forgettable and boring point and click game by BMC Studio.Pros+ Catchy theme tuneCons- Boring- Unfunny- No logic to it- Dead end choicesFinal verdict: 2/10Steam curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews"

Half Life 3 is released, people can't stop playing it and every PC Master Race gamer turns into a zombie. It's up to the ""casual gamer"" to defeat the zombies with the help of Gabe Newell, and to convert to a PC gamer. (unfortunetely the game is so poorly made, that you likely won't even understand what is happening)- Extremely short. All in all, it's about 15minutes worth of actual content- If you don't choose the correct dialogue option, you will get a instant game over and must replay the chapter without being able to skip through the scenes making the game very repetitive.- This ""project"" seemed to have no production value whatsoever. The entire story is about ""Zombies"" but not once do you actually see a zombie. It's sort of like playing ""make believe"" and you are just supposed to imagine the guys are traveling to different places fighting zombies when NOTHING actually happens.- The ""gameplay"" consists of nothing but clicking a few times"

This abomination called ""Zombitatos"" could have been good for one or two laughs, if...... it would be longer than half an hour.... it would feature subtitles. The bad audio makes following the dialogs really difficult.... it would be priced for 50 Cent or for free.... the makers would put a little bit more effort in their game. For example: In one scene, Jack holds a key. Or better, he says he holds a key, but his hands are clearly empty. Was a key so expensive?

The scenes were very professionally done with state of the art audio and video. It could use 3D though. I feel like the many zombies in the game would be more frightening in 3d."

,Recommended,508140,28842423,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,ElNiggativeOne,"What can I say? This game is pretty much perfect.This game presents great compatibility. It is free of lag, it isn't choppy, it's very responsive, the controls are ace, and the abundance of FMV cutscenes, combined with the game's Steam items is more than enough for 2 dollars.HOWEVER, there are two, yes, that's right, TWO complaints that I have with this game.The first is that one of its cutscenes cannot be skipped like the rest. After Jack calls Jon on the phone, the screen where the narator describes the Zombitatos lore to the player is not skipable. As a result, that one part of the game becomes tedious, should you decide to replay this game several times.The second is more economic. I am aware that this game's value is two US dollars on Steam for American audiences, but I had to pay two Euros, since I am a citizen of the EU. The dollar has less value than the Euro, which means I was ripped off for a few cents, but such is life.Aside from these two complaints, the game is perfect, and worth sharing with your friends, should you have its content, like I do. After all, I bought the game since you can't find it torrented."
,Recommended,508140,29522731,Posted: 27 January,all,ur ded kid,"Some people see this game as horrible, and the reviews really got to me and made my expectations really low, however after actaully getting the game, I loved it. It has that real indie feel to it, I'm pretty sure most people made something of this kind at some point or another, however this is one step further, turning indie, (possibly forcefully) unexperienced in-the-genre content into an actual game. Call me tasteless, but I actually enjoy this game so far, I like the jokes, I value the fact, that the developpers at least tried to do something unique. The game has a very nice atmosphere, and if you don't look at it in a bad way in the first place, you can seriously enjoy it. Just because most games from developpers of this size are horrible (I have played quite a few), doesn't mean this one will be, and I think because of that idea most people don't look at the game in a relaxed way, instead strictly judging it. Overall, it's cheap, fun, and worth a few laughs, I recommend you go and check it out."

The voice acting and acting alone is glorious, Oscar winning quality no doubt.

,Recommended,508140,25458356,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,harry,"Even though this game is relatively new it still holds up as being one of, if not THE best zombie game on the market. It's not only fun playing single player but it's hilarious when you can get three more friends to join in the zombie killing.There's of course the standard Easy - Hard difficulities (Here being Easy, Medium, Advanced and Expert). So if you're looking for some mindless slaughtering to do you can put it on easy or if you and your friends is a tatical squad preparing for the zombie apacolypse this is a great way to start!Also you don't have to play ""Kimulator: Fight for your destiny"" to get into this one, all the maps and more from Kimulator are in this one. Even if you want to play oldschool there is a mode for that. Speaking of modes, there's Versus mode which is exactly what it sounds like, you control both the zombitatos and the Pc master race in rounds. The one who ends the final map with the most points win. There is also a realism version of this mode which means the Pc master race can't see the green/orange/red glow around them as they used to.There's also Survival which is aslo what it sounds like. Survive for X amount of time and you get bronze, silver or a gold medal depending on the requirments for the map you're playing.Scavanger is the last major gamemode, here you play as survivor and infected and the objective is to fill a generator with gas. Who wins depends on which team's the fastest.Then, finally, there's something called mutation. These are pretty much fun little mini modes. For example you have to try and survive an entire campaign on your own, you and all your teamates have katanas and can't get other weapons, you need to carry around a lawngnome to win etc."
