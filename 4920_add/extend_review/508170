If a black block appears you hit the other button. Do this as fast as you can. Make one mistake and it's game over. That's the ENTIRE GAME! Pile of crap. Do not spend a penny on it.

,Not Recommended,508170,33160352,Posted: 2 July,all,OctoberFox,"Mind-numbing RepetitionThis is a really simple game where the player is a blacksmith with a hammer and tongs. A row of continuous ingots passes and the player must push the left arrow key, or X on a controller, to hammer red ingots, and the right arrow key, or the A button on a controller, to toss away dark ingots. Speed is rewarded, and there are other blacksmiths to attain while you level up, but there appears to be no value beyond their appearances.That said, this game is extremely mind-numbing. Rifling through ingots by tapping the left or right arrow key was dull and repetitive. A helpful trick I picked up was that a row of visible ingots is always five, so if I saw a row that was totally dark I could use the tongs five times really quickly to toss them away, or the red ones could be pounded out by the hammer in a hurry. There is a timer in the anvil, and every toss or strike will add more time.Visually the game is pretty simplistic. It looks a lot like a cheap mobile game, heavy on vector graphics style. There is little to no variety in sound effects, even when you select a new character they all make the same groans, have exactly the same animations, and that really is the name of the game here; everything is samey, repetitive, and bland.Pros:Controller friendlyResponsive ControlsClean interfaceClean Graphical styleCons:Highly repetitiveBoringVerdict: 3/10An unrewarding tedious repetitive chore. Don't bother."
,Not Recommended,508170,35461437,Posted: 3 October,all,Grey Silhouette,"To start, the game Blacksmith HIT is a game that you would likely find on the app store or something along a flash game site. Even though the price may seem intimidating, don't go for it. The gameplay for this is TOO simple, and TOO short.Pros:○ Nice, clean graphics.○ Repetitive soundtrack that isn't annoying○ Simple to understand, easy to control game.○ Steam Trading Cards, nothing more to say.Cons:○ Game is too short, for a dollar you pay for a game that has a gameplay span of two minutes. You could find more elsewhere, for free.○ Not easy to play often, game is ""completed"" in minutes.○ High score game, however no competition, or community.○ Gameplay is incredibily flawed, if you miss a button once your score is flunked completely and you restart.○ No more ""deep"" or think-about gameplay, two buttons, no technique, simple.Honestly, I wouldn't reccomend this game if you're looking for a game to satisfy your needs gameplay-wise. Maybe if you are collecting games, collecting cards, or need a good offline-game, but even then the game is less than mediocre. Bought the game for a friend and me, was disappointed heavily. Game could be developed to create an interesting concept, but it flunked."
