It's a nice relaxing game if you just want to kill some time. During all my 5 hours of playtime, i've been listening to my own music while playing and it is very, very relaxing. This game is a simple concept, but very well executed, it might even be addicting if the game dev added an endless mode to see how long you can survive.tl;drA really cheap but fun game. Keep up the good work, game dev."

Control a small ball of energy, collecting other coloured balls of energy for powerups, and clouds of energy to complete the level before a time limit, all while avoiding a constant flow of asteroids, which cannot really be shot. They can be blown up with mines or homing missiles, both of which are rather pathetic in practice.I was a bit dissapointed when I first played this game, with the word ""destroy"" in the title, and ""bullet hell"" in the description I was expecting a shoot-em-up. How wrong I was. There's very little destruction going on here. Ok, so you can blow up the occasional asteroid, but the game requires you to collect such a large amount of energy that even when fully powered up you won't be able to fire off lots of missiles or mines very quickly. Admittedly there is one spaceship to be destroyed in the game though, the final boss.Energy and powerups appear and dissapear randomly without warning, which can be a bit annoying, it would have been nice if, for example, they flashed or flickered a few seconds before disappearing.Getting 100% achivements should be pretty easy, if you can bear playing this boring game for about 4-6 hours that is. As it's really all about grinding, repeating the same few levels over and over upgrading your powerups until you get three stars in all levels.Playing on a machine which is above the required specs in all aspects still caused slowdown on the lowest resolution/graphics settings. It was unplayable at times on the highest settings. And it's not like the game is doing anything particularly complex or impressive graphics wise.It might only be a couple of bucks, but if I were you I'd think about spending that money elsewhere. Even if it is on sale.5.7/10"

Strap yourself into the cockpit of your fighter and get ready to blow up some asteroids! The onslaught of asteroids that awaits you would make anyone tremble in fear, but don’t worry – your trusty ship can suck up random power ups to help you get through. You just have to survive long enough to collect enough energy from the asteroids and escape with your life and the asteroids’ loot.Release Date: 27 Jul, 2016The GameplayYou control an orb of energy. The objective of each mission is to collect as much energy as quickly as you can, while you are avoiding asteroids and homing missiles flying at you. There are four ""power-up"" energies you can collect during your missions as they appear. They appear in two situations: randomly appearing within traps, and when asteroids are blown up. The whitish-blue energy increases your movement speed. The green energy makes you temporarily invincible. The red energy gives you mines to blow up asteroids. The yellow energy increases the chances your attacks are multiplied. What's even better is they can be stacked. You can wield all four energies at once, if you can collect them before they expire. Just be careful as you go for the energies, because they're surrounded by traps.All in AllFly and Destroyis a really good Casual Game!8/10 From MeSweep"

I'll try to remember to update this when changes are made.Overall, worth the price."

That doesn't sound so bad, does it? Well, my 3rd monitor is in portrait mode, so it forces the games resolution settings into portrait mode, and I really don't want to play this game on my 3rd monitor in 1080x1920 resolution (yes, that's right, not a typo), so I guess I will never have any idea if this game is worth a damn or not."

,Recommended,508180,30274790,Posted: 2 March,all,nujumkey,"This game is all about collecting energy while dodging meteors and occasionally other objects to unlock new layouts. It has a really neat ability system when you can stop time or place a mine to defend yourself from incoming meteors. The game's easy mode was surprisingly tough for me to clear out, and i imagine the harder modes will provide a meaty challange. I also really like the way a destroyed meteor can sometimes drop a powerup, provides a nice bit of strategy to the game.I enjoyed it, but i have a ton of issues with the game.1. I'm used to useing wasd keys for movement in this style of game, this game uses to mouse to control the character. Now in the options menu there appears to keybindings, but i can't figure out how to switch the game from mouse controls to keyboard, or if that is even a possibility.2. I personally found the mouse sensitivity too high. A menu option to adjust sensitivity would be nice, and the high sensitivity led to me making very slow and tiny movements that went way further than i wanted (especially with the speed power up), and led to what i feel are unfair deaths because the controls are as precise as i would like.3. While the upgrades are nice and it's cool to see some overall progression built into a game like this, the yellow upgrade (which lowers your ability costs) feels incredibly unsatisfying as i never felt like any of the abilities other than timestop was any good. The other three powerups have immedite effects upon collection that feel really good to use (inbulnerability, speed up,  and mines).4. Lack of new content. The first level is as big a complexity bump as you're going to get, Once you figured out the basics, the game does very little to introduce new obtacles or powerups for the player. I'm not finished with the game yet, but being halfway through i feel like you get the same experience playing level one forty times as you would playing all forty levels one time. At the very least change the background every tenth stage or something.All in all, cool game if a bit clunky. Play it if you want very simple dodge mechanics and some tough levels. Or don't, there are plenty of better games on the store.Edit: OK so i realized that the backgrounds are actually different and i'm just blind. I'm leaving the origional review as is because i think the point stands that some diversity would be nice, but i am completely wrong, there are multiple backgrounds."

If you're looking for a superb quick fix, this game is a must have! Games as straight-forward, simple (but not easy), and simultaneously relaxing as this game are rare. Simply put, you will not want to stop playing this game because its short levels are just plain fun, providing quick gratification. Before you know it, a few hours have gone by.You control an orb of energy. The objective of each mission is to collect as much energy as quickly as you can, while you are avoiding asteroids and homing missiles flying at you. There are four ""power-up"" energies you can collect during your missions as they appear. They appear in two situations: randomly appearing within traps, and when asteroids are blown up. The whitish-blue energy increases your movement speed. The green energy makes you temporarily invincible. The red energy gives you mines to blow up asteroids. The yellow energy increases the chances your attacks are multiplied. What's even better is they can be stacked. You can wield all four energies at once, if you can collect them before they expire. Just be careful as you go for the energies, because they're surrounded by traps.Your ""weapons"" consist of mines that you can manually ""plant"", a circular force field of anti-gravity that surrounds you, repelling asteroids, and the ability to temporarily freeze time, which allows you to maneuver through tight spots.This game is similar to Asteroids, but but with so many more variables and incentives. You don't actually have to destroy the asteroids, but doing so causes the colored energies to appear. You earn stars after completing each mission. How many stars you earn depends on how well and efficient you perform. The more missions you complete, and the more stars you earn, the more you can level up the energies, amplifying their enhancements, as well as increasing their duration. You can then go back and replay previous missions in order to get more stars, which you can then apply toward leveling up your skills even more.In a nutshell, this is one of the best games I've played, as far as ""casual"" games go. Sometimes I just want to sit down and play a fun, simple, and relaxing game, and with this game, the developer has mastered that niche."
