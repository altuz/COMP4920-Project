76561198045869365,Recommended,508190,32322402,Posted: 10 June,all,Derekmacen22,"haven't been playing for an extremely long time but from what i've played of it seemed really good. The system in this game is pretty dope, it was alot better then i thought it would be.  The game doesn't really have a very intricate story and the written dialogue seems off a bit. Epecially when the main dark knight character refers to some woman as men. but besides that the gameplay was really good in my opinion.TO SUM IT UPYou start off pretty much going into an endless array of battles till you drop/die, which after you do you get sent to camp where you lose all your items that either refill health or enpower you. but you still get to keep the souls you obtained off of everything you have killed. which then can be spent on a really good skill tree that can near increase any little thing of your character. Like crit rate and speed, and even item power besides the basic ones like defense and attk power. and those are just a couple out of like 15 to 20 skills that can also be increase multiple times. So yeah i love that aspect.The combat itself was good the running attacks were op. All the attack animations were good.  I especially liked the counter dodge u can do. if that is what u call it, all i know is when something attacks or charges at me and if i dodge them before they hit me, i end up doing a special attack on them that does some pretty crazy damage.So all in all this plays pretty good in my opinion and the bonus mature content never hurts. my only complaint is the keybinding, which gets real buggy. Epecially if you try to open it during your gameplay. I would actually really like to have more buttons to map in the future. Granted u can do some changes but its limited. being able to map buttons on my mouse would of been much apreciated. which may not make sense to most since u spam attacks so much that it seems easier to use you keys instead but u gotta weave in and out when attacking so u really can't spam attacks like crazy.  Well anyway Hope they keep up the good work"

Game's coming out this month, has a guy ingame tell you if you don't like it ask for a refund through paypall, some broken mechanics etc, then I realized what this game is. It's EA monster hunter, with ""waifus"", lewd graphics, almost no plot at all and basically no instructions.Short version is you are spawned in with a weapon, hammer, sword n shield etc, each of these has its own gimmicks like in mh, hammer stuns sheild can wreck with a counter via dodging etc, but none of this is told to you, nor that you are expected to die, even though doing so costs you the bit of story progress you made. Areas are randomized, so you won't be retreading the exact route, you get souls from enemies with which you can buff your character, very vital. Can be fun, either needs to go all the way with the lewd or drop it and be the demake of mh it could shine as."

The more you get beat on, the more it damages your armour.  Eventually your amour will break minimizing and even neutralizing it's effectiveness (and render a generous amount of fan-service until you get it repaired).The pick-ups are generous throughout the game and there are plenty of ""we hid something in here so break this"" destructible objects.My real only gripes are:1) The controls seem a bit too stiff at times and I have a hard time turning to face enemies that come up from behind my character quickly (but I'm sure that I'll be able to adapt to this as I play).2) I don't usually use a controller when I play, but it almost feels like controller support was an afterthought.  The ability to customize the controller settings would be something I wouldn't mind seeing in future updates so that the buttons make more sense in their layout.All in all, a very good game that has a lot of potential and I look forward to seeing where it goes from here.Now, for the devs:You guys really need to have more confidence in yourselves as developers and, and this is important, DO NOT BE AFRAID TO FAIL!  It just felt wierd to see you guys bring up the ability to get a refund from you if we don't like the game IN THE GAME.  If players like it, they'll like it - if they don't, they won't.  Just focus on making this a game that is a high quality and fun to play game as you ablity will allow and let the rest sort itself out, okay?"

I know this game only just came out and will continue to be improved upon drastically! In the first three days since release the developer has fixed a TON of problems! I'm really starting to like this and I hope to support this developer far into the future, especially if they keep listening this hard to the fans.Edit: Since I originally posted this review the game has gotten far more content than I expected, with new weapons, levels and enemies. It's also had a lot of bug fixes making it a far more enjoyable experience. For what it is, I honestly couldn't reccomend this game enough. Especially for the asking price."

It plays out much like an older 2-D Arcade style beat-em-up. Decent controls, decent gameplay, etc etc. My only two gripes with the game, at the moment, is i have the worst luck with it, (Literally the first room i fought in when i first played the game was the Boss)  and you don't keep any of your equipment or gold after you die, only the Dragon Souls (AKA Stat points) you use to upgrade your character.If i might suggest some features; A partial gold keep (Like, say, 20% of your gold is kept, the rest is lost..Maybe an upgradable?), a ""Stash"" of items, and a store at the beginning area. Also, the ability to go backwards..Unless i am stupid and can't figure out how to go backwards. Also, hopefully some way to upgrade your current armor. And finally, i hope you implement a ""Region skip"", where you can teleport to any region you've unlocked after beating the boss once."

Even though the attack animations are not as great as the 2 games I compared this with, I still like it.I wish we could keep the weapons and armors we get instead of replacing the current equipped weapon and armor, so that we could collect them or sell them at shop npc. If the nudity got remove, I'll be okay with it but if there's a dlc patch to make it uncensored then I'll get it as well. Anyway looking forward for the full release of this game."

Hit detection with some weapons should be fixed, and there are still many bugs, localization problems and some other problems normal to early access games. It's a fun game, all the same. There plenty of weapons and armor that alter stats, visual and game style as well, and a progression system similar to Rogue Legacy. Also, there's slight nudity here and there and clothes-destroying mechanics, similar to the Senran Kagura games (not entirely developed yet, it seems). To be honest, I could do without the pseudo-hentai aspects of the game, which is a positive thing to say about the game. I would recomend it if you can get it on a sale."

It's eary access, and updates every month or so. Initially when i first bought it, the game was solidly mediocre, 5 chracters to choose from (different weapons and play styles), no plot, and 3 levels to play through. You'd choose two characters, and swap between them at will (losing that ability if one dies). As someone who plays beat-em-up's occasionally, the difficulty was do-able. There was a power-up tree that let you level up passive skills earn you die (damage boosts, hp boosts, etc), leveling those allowed me to progress further each time.  Looked like it had potential.The game has changed since then. A cliche storyline that's poorly proofread has been added in (It's not quite bad enough to call it engrish, but it's noticible). There's no more choosing your character, you've got a single chracter than gets a randomly chosen weapon at the beginning (and those can be unplayably weak for casual people). There's no more two character system, instead you get a super-powerful male knight (in a game's that's big draw is the girls) walking around with you and giving you a little scene the first time you reach an area. The first boss is now essentially unbeatable if you're doing a fresh run (for casual types, beat-em-up pro's make find it doable), unless you get VERY lucky with item drops. There arn't enough enemies to level your skills in a realisitic manner before the boss either (although if you want to do 20-30 runs feel free). My older save (which was leveled nicely, but not OP) had a hard time with the first boss, I tried a fresh run, and there's just no way. But on the positive side, your (single) option for a character now can change her costume. Yay?All in all, I liked the earlier versions better. It went from moderately difficult to rediculously difficult (for casual players, pro's opinions may differ), and the battle system took a hit at the same time. While it -may- improve in the future, I'd recommend finding an up to date rewiew that lists whats currently in the game, maybe an up to date video as well. It's definitely changed in the past, and I'd be surprised if it doesn't again."

Learning each bosses pattern can be challenging and take some thought.I am not a fan of the cut scene art work personally. It actually detracts from the game if you ask me and I would love to see more options of ""choice"" in your character.

Also with all the weapons and their upgrades and the outfits and their upgrades. It gives a form of progression and just knowing that I'm getting each and everytime that much stronger due to a small feature which is the dragon souls, these act as upgrade points and these will allow you to upgrade your HP, attack or defense starting out and even crit chance, however and I cannot help but sort of chuckle about this feature. You're equipment can break, and it'll show the stuff under it and well it's nice not to have an overly censored game. I eagerly look forward to the updates to this game.

Even in game, the creator says they are constantly working on the game to be better. My only gripes are that the combat system takes a second to get used to, and the controls are a bit stiff. It would be nice to be able to dodge both up and down, instead of side to side. Some of the monsters essentially charge the same way you dodge, which makes it hard [ if not impossible ] to dodge. Still, this game is really good, and even I gotta admit that some of the fanservice did have me chuckling [ ninja vs scorpion was funny to me, at least ]. Overall, Im glad I got this, and Im looking forward to seeing more of the development of the game."
,Recommended,508190,31648251,Posted: 9 May,all,DSMTurboAWD,"This might change in the future as it is early access, but as it stands not, I am not sure I can recommend this game in its current form.I have had more time to play the game and am updating my opinion in the review accordinglyIt is impressive, especially if it is ia single individual on the project considering it was released in November.I also like that there have been regular updates each month since release(save for April)There was a decent content update today (May 12th 2017). I may do a video review at some point to illustrate some of the oddities.For $4.00 USD it is not bad for what you are getting but there are a lot of glaring issues.Pro-It caters to a very particular audience. ^_^Golden-Axe/Beat-em-up action.Excellent art style.Nice backgrounds/Environments.Nice characters.Good choice of equipment (when looting).music is OK.Sound is OK.Con-(again this may change as the product updates)Weak controlsThe hit boxes when using weapons are odd. Realistic I guess, considering the weapons (hammer has a small end, arrows are a single target projectile, etc.) but it makes it difficult to play and enjoy.For example, the hammer weapon's hitbox is a 1m wide by 1 pixel tall pad about 1 m in front of the character. This means that if something is on top of you, you will miss, or if they are slightly above you, you will miss. This goes especially for the jars and bowls that litter the landscape. I seriously cannot break them with the hammer, or the bow for that matter.The sword weapon does not have this problem as it seems to have a much wided spread.Movement is slow, even with speed upgrades.Controls are stiff, in most beat-em-ups if you (on the controller) change directions, the character does so smoothly. Here it is inconsistent, clunky, making it not very enjoyable.Enemies will cheap shot all the time, even when you cannot hit them, they can hit you.Bosses at the early levels can one shot the player before upgrading your junk. (I realize the rogue-like aspect is part of this but...)Small nit-picksThese are items that would be nice, but overall do not effect the overall gameplay.Animations are weird. These (may?) be smoothed out in the future. But for example, the rolling animation is just a bloom effect over the player with their knees bent, with the model rotating (not an actual rolling animation).It would be nice to select an initial weapon, rather than being stuck with whatever you get.Many grammar and spelling issues in dialog.Interactions with NPCs should pause the action.Healing items while plentiful, are not effective enough to heal any real damage (10 points / 150 health is not helpful) even with upgrades.After playing a bunch more this seems to be less of an issue, further into the game the healing items are a lot more plentifulFinal ThoughtsThis game does have potential to become something excellent.While it is appreciated, the eye-candy should not be the only selling point (see store page image).Solid game-play and interesting story seems to be in the works, but not quite there yet.I am changing my recommendation from no, to yes after further consideration. I've spent about 3+ hours messing around and it is enjoyable, especially considering the price. It still has a ways to go but it iis a good time.Gameplay 6/10Graphics 7/10Story 6/10Music 7/10Potential 10/10"

,Recommended,508190,31436618,Posted: 29 April,all,Onibi Onna,"Woop woop, kay this is just a lot of things I noticed, and a few of them are likely to be fixed but I'll add em anyway. Things will be added as I progress. Hella long tbh, I'll add some general suggestions at the bottom and the tldr- First thing I noticed is that the how to play menu needs a bit of a grammer check. Properties is spelt incorrectly and a lot of actions need capitilisation, otherwise, succinct and with good placement. However for this kind of game, it usually is good to have a optional tutorial available, for both newbies and the experienced, it gives a short idea of the game. Don't. Force. It. On. The. Player. A lot get stupidly worked up over it so it's just best to put it as optional- Loading screen girls seem to have a drastically different art style from the others, as it's after just leaving the start screen, with very polished designs, it's very jarring for that kind of change, and it needs to be fixed if it's going to be shown continually through the game (They get better after, but the two first ones need to be fixed)- THE TEXT, okay, I'm not sure if it's just me but that text seems to go slow, fast, slow, fast, fast, FASTER. Not to mention it's white text on a black background. That kind of method is...acceptable for a short message, typically used for quotes of some form or another. But the long detailed story being blasted into my face not even a second in is giving me flashbacks of waiting for LOZ characters to finish their dang monologuesI'd say, add designs into the background to visually interest the player. For this kind of ""Many Years Ago"" story, a static image works best in most cases, but I'd suggest between 2-3 for each 'scene' so to speak- When going to the menu, let me continue using wasd keys, don't suddenly make me switch over to mouse so I can adjust settings- Kay I just wanna take the writing and fix it badly, it doesn't flow and while I am VERY aware that that is not the focus, bad writing hurts a game badly. I could forgive errors at this stage of development, but the writing itself is weird and just...startling- Combat works fairly nicely. However I would like it if you could at least be able to pick up more than one weapon at a time, or at least a skill that does that. I do like that I can continue going for a combo and be able to switch directions mid-way, feels good man- Glitches occasionally when switching weapons, leaving the comparison bar (idk) still at the bottom- Talking to people says pickup like they were an item and I feel like I'm flirting on them and getting smoothly rejected. Also, please fix the problem with the text, it moves so strangely and I keep having to go through allll the dialogue again- The images are very good, but it does feel that the rest of the games art lacks a bit in comparison_____Kay, so I feel that this game would work better as more of a side-scroller, because of how the weapons all seem to attack in whichever direction your facing, or at least with a narrower area of walkingRoguelike games get relatively boring once you've made it to a higher level, crashed and burned, then have to start all over again, it's not hard in any way it's just annoying and tedious. So checkpoint system is seriously necessary, as in a pick your level checkpoint system so players can grind, or if they haven't played for a while they can get themselves back into it from a lower a levelThe combat system is...bittersweet, while I do like the weapons and fighting, I don't like the fact that I can mash J and flip a coin to see if I live or die. With this kind of combat, thing should be fast and snappy, even on keyboard you need to be able to move the character how you want. In that respect, please add diagonal movement for keyboard and fighting, especially for a 3d fighterWhen speaking to someone, you're going to talk with regularly, such as the people at your base (?), do it as more of a visual novel style thing then a speech bubble, keep that for minor charactersAlso, I'd say add some area's without fighting, like towns or cities, possibly with ways to gain CG's or a sort of gladiatorial area where you have to see how far you can get, and earn something, idk. Just some sort of method which is optional but definitely adds to the experience, and lessens the feeling of repetition. Towns could also give options for side quests, such as rescuing girls that can be recruited or beat x level of enemies here. This will help massively if you want to have this story arc, let you add in story elements, let the player learn things about the worldAnd I hate saying this over and over again, but there needs to be better dialogue, there's no need for flowery prose, but there has to be a description of some form, and the characters need to speak individually to keep them from blending together. Also, I know it's tempting, but don't shove information down a characters throat, go slow and allow the world building to happen as the story progresses, it adds interest to the player and propells them to keep going if there is more to find outI don't wish for a refund because I'd like to see how it goes, this has every capability of being a good game, just needs more work. I think I had more but it's late and I need to sleep"

All of the staples are here: healing and attack items to pick up, multiple areas that are blocked until all enemies are killed and multiple weapons (three as of this date) that have their own single combo and special attack. Unfortunately, the attack system feels a bit stiff and some annoying problems are visible. This isn't SakuraGame's' first game, however, and the Early Access platform gives them a great opportunity to make some changes. The current build is relatively slim in terms of area length, but it does provide the appropriate setting needed to explain the plot.According to a legend, a dragon will appear from the cracks between Heaven and Hell, bringing catastrophe in its' wake. Humanity decided to prepare for this tragedy by establishing the Dragon Knights, a group of highly skilled hunters destined to roam the lands in search of this dragon and its' kin. The player takes the role of a nameless heroine during a final trial organized by the 13th Dragon Knight Team. The goal is to vanquish the old dragon at the end of the course, vanquishing monsters and collecting new gear as the player pushes forward. The old dragon's death guarantees membership into the Dragon Knights and potentially raises the curtain to the final battle against the fabled dragon that will usher forth disaster.The game is extremely colorful, ranging from the weapon and clothing patterns to the environment's lush foliage and rock formations. While the outfits have beautiful designs and weapon skills produce some neat particle effects, the character animations for the main heroine feel awkward at times due to the rag doll appearance of certain movements. Enemy attack animations are great overall and their standard appearances are just as vibrant as the NPCs posing in certain areas. The score delivers on most fronts, but is very quiet in relation to the sound effects. It is a good set of tracks that unfortunately get drown out by weapon strikes and the heroine's battle cries.Each round begins with a randomized weapon and suit of armor that sport their own distinct stats and skills. The player then ventures into the wilds to kill monsters, collect coins and dragon souls, destroy breakable terrain for items and claim the chest that appearances once all the monsters are killed. Similar to other side-scrolling brawlers, attacking is dependent on the hit box of the weapon and the y-axis location. Enemies can attack the player even if you can't hit them depending on the angle, which makes the dash (double tap A or D) ability a crucial tool to avoid frustrating situations. If the enemy hits enough times, the armor's stats will degrade and the heroine's breasts will be exposed (which is the only source of nudity I have discovered in the game so far). Replacing the broken armor will repair the stat degradation, which can either be bought by NPCs or looted from the chests in each zone.Aside from the hack and slash component, there are also some rogue-lite elements in the form of character enhancement using dragon souls collected from fallen enemies. Upon dying, the player is brought to the dragon screen to place the souls into a branching set of attributes that range from increased stats, skill attack power, the amount of health restored by items and the likelihood of more money dropping from enemies. Every enhancement is blocked until the previous one is bought and each trait has multiple tiers with increasing cost. Some of the increases are very minimal, but others such as health and coin drop rate go a long way to making the gauntlet less nerve ranking.Technical issues are plentiful and span from enemies getting stuck in one spot to enemies venturing outside the border of the map. Weapons have a tendency to not animate during attacks and there is even a chance to lose your weapon completely when switching out for a new one. Key bidding seems to reset to default whenever I turn off the game and there are times the keys will not allow certain inputs. It is also not advisable to attempt changes to the settings during game play due to a serious issue with the settings window remaining after accepting the changes, leading to a situation where the player is unable to move their character or navigate the menu. It has lead to plenty of forced shutdowns to escape the conundrum and reattempt the changes in the main menu.As stated by a NPC in the starting area, the game is estimated to take six months for completion with an update expected every two weeks. The game currently features a fraction of weapons and armor with many of them utilizing repeat spells. The forest area is the only playable area at the moment with the entrance to the snow region marking the end of the build. Incorporate the plethora of technical issues and it would make the $4 price tag seem a little steep. Should you decide to take the plunge, know it is still a decent side-scroller. I just have a hard time recommending it with the current problems it has.This has been a EAW PSA."

What makes it bad is just the character have to be in a straight line to the enemies to hit them, while the enemies can hit you if they are standing above or below that ""line"", which makes you vulnerable because the attack animations of the character is so slow, that its quite difficult move away or dodge through. Another thing is when the character gets hit, she often fly back and just laying on the ground and it takes some time to get up, so if there are more enemies around, they just kill you instantly. Maybe the animations are that long, so people can stare at the character for its ""Fan Service""....

Used primarily in carpentry, planks are critical in the construction of ships, houses, bridges, and many other structures.[1] Planks also serve as supports to form shelves and tables.Usually made from sawed timber, planks are usually more than 1 1⁄2 in (38 mm) thick, and are generally wider than 2 1⁄2 in (64 mm). In the United States, planks can be any length and are generally a minimum of 2 in (51 mm) deep by 8 in (200 mm) wide, but planks that are 2 in (51 mm) by 10 in (250 mm) and 2 in (51 mm) by 12 in (300 mm) are more commonly stocked by lumber retailers. Planks are often used as a work surface on elevated scaffolding, and need to be wide enough to provide strength without breaking when walked on.

Not to say its terrible, by any means, but theres absolutely no way id say the game is actually good. Putting effort into a game doesnt make it good by default (and the effort is evident)This is a rather standard 2d side scroller roguelike... thing... that i swear half of you bought because of the nudity tag (be honest). And while it looks reasonably nice, and contains a good selection of weapons, armor and consumables of varying types, the game commits just about every single sin a sidescroller can, and every sin a roguelike can, and ends up coming off as a clunky, poorly constructed bunch of potentially good ideas that was probably hindered by development experience or skill.Make no mistake, it COULD still be an excellent game given time, especially since its only been a few months. But short of a Necropolis level update (look it up if you dont know if it) it will never reach its true potential.(Also, if anyone tries to use stupid ""errr, you only played half an hour"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t as a defence, ill treat you like the moron you are.
