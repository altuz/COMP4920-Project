76561198006413390,Recommended,508230,26458860,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,woosk,"This is a short visual novel with stats management where Yukari decides to pursue her dreams to produce an anime after graduating from high school and waiting for her university term to start. With her best friend Mayumi, two sisters Yuuko and Sumiko, Shunsuke and the initial investment in capital given by Yukari's grandmother, the team embark on a 12-week project that will put Yukari and her team's (and the player's) decision making and efforts to the test.The game has plenty of save slots to replay a particular section of the game, 9 shown stats and 2 hidden stats which affect the quality and outcome of the anime production and the ending of the game and the option to skip and fast-forward already read sections. The game will require some familiarity with the expected activity Yukari and each team member can perform as it is fixed at each week as well as the possible bonuses and penalties given to each decision Yukari makes during various events. Certain random events will appear at different parts of the 12-week playthrough and certain decisions made can have variable effects. Soundtracks and overall game presentation are decent. Recommended when at discount as it takes less than 10 hours to try to produce 3 different genre of anime and attempt to reach the best ending in the game over 3 or more separate playthroughs."

The anime studio management part is just very basic and not really comparable to a real sim. Basically it's checking stress meters and telling your ""employees"" to relax from the two more or less interchangable tasks they can perform once their meter gets too high. That's it. It's full of plot conveniences (you need a writer? well guess who you just ran into on the streets infront of your favourite café) and holes (you constantly worry about budget, but I guess going out for dinner once a week with your group and spending tons on anime CD/figurines for ""research"" isn't a part of that).The main cast is so flat and boring that I don't even care to know how one dimensional their anime would have been. Given that it doesn't even have voice acting (and at times not even background music) it's not really worth the money at this point in time."
,Recommended,508230,26396705,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,Surebi,"First impressions of the game: So I just completed my first run of the game, I love the idea of the game, from what I have seen there are only 3 different genres to choose from 'Harem Anime, Mystery Anime, and Action Anime'.The game starts off as a Visual Novel for about 20 or so minutes (depending on how fast you read) and then is a mix of VN and choices which affect how your anime will be going. Now of course I failed, at the start I made good choices but as time went on, not so many good choices. I enjoyed the dialog and thought it was interesting and good, I had a laugh or two here and there.Just a heads up, there is no audio of any sorts if you are expecting it, I thought there would be but then after checking back here I realised there was no voice acting in this game/ VN. It doesn't seem that there is much of a variety with genre choices as well, which absoutly sucks in my opinion, I hope they change this at some point in a update, to make the game have more of a variety in content. This is because 3 different genres probably would get boring pretty fast even with 6 different endings.Gameplay: 7/10Music: 7/10Visuals: 9/10Dialog: 7/10In short, if you are looking for something fun, and that will kill sometime, I would recommend taking a look at this game, however it may not be for everyone as it still lacks in a fair few elements. The art is absolutly fantastic and looks so well done, I'm sure the developers spent a lot of time creating the art for this. The music was fantastic (when it did come on)."

As far as the storyline goes, there are minimal choices that you can make, and much of the storyline is the same or similar regardless of what genre of anime you choose. The plot appears to be fairly linear, and I have yet to find any choices that really cause the story to branch off. Furthermore, I would say that the music is average, and the characters, while drawn quite well, seem to fall a bit flat at times.However, if there is one good thing about this game, it would be that it is surprisingly difficult. Many factors throughout the story influence the characters in ways that you cannot control, and you can easily find a team member quitting or yourself bankrupt. Admittedly, I have yet to reach the ""good"" ending; I have reached a ""bad"" one only once, and have failed part of the way through at least three times. It can be infuriating at times, but it also guarantees more gameplay for those who are determined to unlock all achievements. A fair warning, however: going back through the story after you've either beaten the game or failed part of the way through quickly becomes boring. There is an option to fast forward through the ""dialogue"" and skip straight to the ""choices"", but it leaves very little gameplay.In conclusion, I would not recommend this game. While it's difficulty could be seen as a plus, the lack of choices, the seemingly linear storyline, the average characters and soundtrack, and the lack of replay value do little for the game's value. If, despite all this, you still want to purchase this game, I would highly recommend waiting until it goes on sale."
,Not Recommended,508230,29538543,Posted: 28 January,all,Archeia,"First things first, the art is nice. The soundtrack is OK. Nothing much to say about them to be honest.I played this game mostly hoping for a good simulation VN in the same vein as Kairosoft, Hanako games and the like. I'm a huge fan of simulation games! But for its name, it fails the 'simulation' aspect of its name and I believe is incredibly misleading.My issue is with its gameplay and story. The simulation aspect is just too simple, make sure that nobody else is stressed or it's game over. Once you get into the groove of things and RNGesus events don't mess you up, you'll be able to make that awesome anime. Even the 'story' is not engaging enough and I do not feel compelled to see these characters 'succeed' in their adventure. The part where they messed up the storyboards and the studio not clarifying with them doesn't feel realistic. And to be honest, I finished this game under 2 hours with all achievements to properly gauge its replay value. And it's just...well...lackluster.I cannot recommend this sadly. Maybe if it had different title and didn't have simulation on the title I wouldn't have come to this with different expectations."
,Recommended,508230,31579534,Posted: 6 May,all,Oppaidaisuke69 ツ,"What this game contributed me:+ STRESS  ( Unexpected random events can affect your anime route )- TIME MANAGEMENT  (Wasted a lot of time playing this games and got a hang of it )- FUNDS  ( I paid computer rentals and electricity bills playing this one )+ PROFICIENCY  ( Can enhance your analytical, strategical and motor skills )+ NETWORKING  (You need a guide, discussion and updates about this game )And most of all, making your own anime studio is not that easy as it seems. This game serves as a basis on how you manage the studio ( If you wan't to build one later).Recommended for players who likes visual novels. Good luck playing this game and may your anime be a success."
,Recommended,508230,35232712,Posted: 26 September,all,DreadPolecat218,"If I had reviewed Anime Studio Simulator before I achieved the highest anime success (the 'Acclaimed Anime Expert' achievement), I would have given it a thumbs down. It is too easy to fail, because you have relatively little control over the characters stress and happiness levels during the week after making your task choices at the beginning of the week. Funding is also a constant issue and you will not be able to complete a decent anime without money. Even if you complete an anime, it is difficult to produce a high quality anime (as in get enough stars for each production category) and this seems to come back to funding... Thankfully someone has written a great in-depth guide to the game and outlines each character's strengths. This helped me to effectively strategise.I liked that it was a visual novel / simulator. As a visual novel it was really fun, because the choices I made actually had an impact on the characters and the story. As a simulator, it gave me a chance to manage the team through choices of member tasks, upgrades, and outsourcing options at the beginning of each week. I liked the art style and the background music didn't get annoying either. The characters are all likeable too. For these reasons I recommend the game.I bought this game on sale."

Visual novels tend to have better stories, characters etc. But don't have quite this level of decision making. But as a game, it doesn't have enough decision making to make it a good game. Overall, I would say it is okay, but maybe only about 5.5/10. It has some good elements, but most of it is rather bland."

76561198069159152,Recommended,508230,31366176,Posted: 25 April,all,wrb41977,This is an interesting little visual novel. You play as a group of people deciding to make an anime on your vacation (I think you are getting ready to go to college). Through management activities you may be able to make a great anime that will be remembered for years to come. But it will take effort... and making sure no one burns out from little happiness or high stress...Quite fun.

76561198048212729,Not Recommended,508230,29812911,Posted: 9 February,all,true_color222,Much more of a visual novel then a simualtor. I skipped through alot of the talking and there was still little to no game play as the weeks went by in game. I actually do hope I can find it in me to do a real play through of this game but it really doesn't seem to be what I bargained for and in my opinion should regrain from using the word Simulator in the title.

I believe that anyone who loves anime will love this game the music is nice and it fits with the mood for each scene while still having you the player making some tough decisons.I also am currently playing it on my Youtube channel I'd love it if you'd check it out:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBlyU_kQjSOa5ZVFZtO8hBw"

Nice animations/arts even though there weren't any voice acts but still it's alright. Like the story too, pretty refreshing for a VN (suprisingly it didn't bore me like some other VNs do) so I do recommend this game! The price is worth it (y) ^_^"
