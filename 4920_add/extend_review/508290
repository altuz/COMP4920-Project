,Not Recommended,508290,24612465,"Posted: 30 July, 2016",all,Sprengi,The game speed seems to be tied to the frame rate / monitor refresh rate. If you run a 120hz/144hz setup you can't play the game at all because your ship runs out of speed before even reaching the first power up. Sloppy programming there.
76561198173829486,Recommended,508290,24584507,"Posted: 28 July, 2016",all,bobbobinson557,"If you have a dollar collecting dust in your Steam wallet, go for it. The game does exactly what it claims to. You don't need a huge open world or an in-depth character-driven story to have fun. Sometimes lazy button tapping is all you need. I can easily see this game being in an arcade, myself dumping quarters into it, and grinding for that elusive high score.That said, I have a few complaints. Nothing deal-breaking, but I hope the developer sees this and takes notes.Number one: the options menu. You've got music and sound on or off, and windowed mode. This game doesn't need the huge amount of options like most games, but it could use a volume slider at least. I like to listen to podcasts and audiobooks while playing games. I still like to faintly hear the game, but the only way I can get the game at the appropriate volume will make anything else too quiet.Number two: gamepad support. There is none. I'm not a developer, but how hard could it be to get a simple game like this to recognize left and right inputs from an analog stick or D-pad? The keyboard controls as-is are satisfactory, but the extra option would be nice.Number three: gameplay. The two necessary changes that stick out to me are balance and the lack of a quick restart option. When your ship runs out of speed you lose. This automatically takes you back to the main menu. It is only three clicks to get back into the game from the main menu, but it would be nice if instead the game gave two options at the failure state: to restart with the currently selected ship or to go to the main menu. A single round doesn't last too long, so those three clicks can get tedious after a while.I haven't unlocked the two other ships, so maybe this criticism is addressed by the attributes of these ships, but it feels too easy to lose with the default ship. I don't think it's possible to recover from the 'big slow' obstacle, even if you were at the maximum speed. If it is supposed to be a 1HKO then just end the game immediately when it's hit.Number 4: menu controls. You can control the ship with A D, right and left arrow keys, and the mouse, but the menus can only be selected with the mouse. This leads to having to awkwardly move the mouse cursor out of the way after selecting start game, if you play with either set of keys. Again, it's not a hinderance to fun, but it's one of those small things that make the experience more enjoyable. Menu movement with W S or up and down arrows and selecting with the enter or spacebar keys would solve this problem in a jiffy.So despite these issues, I wholeheartedly recommend this game for one dollar. It's not going to be the most breathtaking, exciting experience ever, but great in its own way. A nice, humble little game to relax and unwind with."

It's a casual game that falls flat in the gameplay department.Basically, the gameplay hasn't been tweaked and balanced enough, or possibly at all. Basically, you switch between lanes trying to avoid obstacles and pick up speed boosts that appear in a row ahead of you. The biggest problem is that it's grossly unforgiving- hit one obstacle and you're done for. If you miss a boost, you might make it to the next row but your ride is going to be painfully slow and it feels like you're barely creeping to the next row. The second biggest problem is that anything except the boost is basically useless. You can pick up health, but anything that damages you will kill you by slowing you down anyway. You can pick up money, but there aren't any upgrades so it's basically just for score. You can pick up rockets that destroy the obstacle in front of you- automatically and before you see it- making them next to useless.Once you get the hang of it, it's easy and boring. There doesn't appear to be any difficulty ramp or surprises.The game is kind of unpolished- a lousy menu system and next to no options, as well as music that doesn't perfectly loop- but that's excusable for a $1 game. I feel this would make a better mobile game than a desktop game as well.With a little more work, this could have been a decent game, but even for $1 I can't recommend it."

Not only does the developer rip you off, but he even tells you while he is doing it. That way if this matter ever goes to court, in his defence he can utter the words ""But your honour I did tell him in the title I was taking him for a $1.00 ride when he bought it! Hence he was agreeing to the terms of being RIPPED OFF when he purchased the game.""Take him to COURT! HA! That's rich! If you can find the little smeg head. He has chosen a company name which sends you to nowhere else than a hair dresser salon...http://behappystudio.com/Hence not only can we not send him to court, we can't even fill his inbox with snake head emoji's. He has covered all of his bases. (Scrotum emoji). I just can't wait for the sequel of this game. Dead set a sequel is coming out soon called, ""I stunned him with a taser, took his wallet, helped myself to $50.00, used his phone while he was stunned to make several long distance calls to Nigeria, I then kidnapped his body, did nasty unmentionable things to him and then threw his body out onto the curb from a fast moving car and just to top it all off, when he was recovering in a psychiatric ward I sent him a couple of postcard reminders from my new 3 storey villa in Hawaii to say thanks!"" Granted a long title, but it promises to be one hell of a ride!Offcourse the sequel to this game will send you to a dog bathing web site for those who wish to follow up about the legalities of the matter.In a nut shell, a left and right arrow game which hurls a ridiculous assortment of nasties down to you, the objective is to collect speed bursts constantly ignoring everything else, while you wonder why I bought this. 6 achievements, 5 which do not work. 3 Spaceships, 2 of which will never unlock. A leader board which you will get 4th place after your first try. No distance indicator. No tally to show how close you’re getting to unlocking achievements, because as stated they do not work.The biggest mystery to me is why this takes more PC memory than this game which is way better?http://store.steampowered.com/app/242820/Below is me playing $1.00 ride while you wait for the sequel aka '$50.00 ride' to come out...https://youtu.be/OB04mQ1v6JM"

With my computer's specs, I'm getting 1100FPS+(CPU-wise, only 144 frames actually displayed) which means game over INSTANTLY.

Another reason to buy games like this one is to expand the own library, a sad consolation indeed if that is the case.When I started the first session and my spaceship did not fly any further than freaking 3 meters I was totally confused and checked the controls again just to see that I did nothing wrong regarding the controls. So I tried collecting this Kamehameha-booster and guess what, I was flying! For a couple seconds....See, I don't mind the existence of trash games, but I could at least expect a spaceship able to fly on its own without Goku blasting its butt off.I do not only not recommend this game, I dare you to waste that money rather on Dogecoins than to even think about buying this game.Smokagon, out~BTW: Bought this game for 10 cents thanks to a coupon (!), I finally had a chance to actually use a coupon, yay!"

For what it is, in some ways, it's almost TOO simple.A heads up for some people - the achievements have to be accomplished in a single game.  E.g. 100 health packs in single game as opposed to 100 picked up over 5 different rounds.- Support for a controller other than the keyboard would be nice.- You use the keyboard to play, but MUST use the mouse to navigate the menus. Annoying.  Wouldn't be a problem except...- Auto-returns to the menu after every round.  No option to just play again- No clue how to unlock the other two ships.  The requirements aren't listed anywhere I can find.- The achievement for ""Play 20 times"" either doesn't work, or must refer to LOADING THE GAME 20 times.  I've played at least 20 with no credit.So yes...like I said.  Worth buying for a lark while it's on sale.  I wouldn't pay a dollar for it though.This is a particularly unforgiving game.  Anything other than a small mistake under the most favorable circumstances for making it and it's game over.  You pretty much have to progress almost flawlessly."

Get it on sale and you can have a few moments of fun with it before cashing in on the Trading Cards. If it wasn't for the issues with system-dependant game speed it'd have more potential in that Robot Unicorn kinda way.
