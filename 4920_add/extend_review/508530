No. You are.Here's the deal.Nod your head to the soundtrack.Move your guy around.Don't fall off the screen.Kick the ball.Nod your head to the soundtrack.Double jump.Don't hit the red squiggles.Get the ball to the stickers. (Or pro-tip. Skip the ♥♥♥♥ing stickers.)Get the ball to the goal.Laugh at how terrible everyone is at this game.Nod your head to the soundtrack.This game is hard.And it's good.Rub your wallet on this game.Rub this game on your face.Rub this game on your friend's face.Rub your face on your friend's face.You get the idea."

No, I'll never finish nor master this title. I love the artwork and the music. The controls are great - I played solely with a controller.It is brutally difficult, but fair.The idea is definitely fresh and at least the early levels are fun and seem well thought out."

It's also great!No complaints about gameplay at all.Have unlocked all playable characters and achievements.My only suggestion involves the level selection. Would love to have a return to level select from the pause menu that would take you to the level select screen for the World that you are currently on. Also, having the page turn to the next/previous world if you go past the first/last level of the current world instead of looping through the levels of the one world."
,Recommended,508530,30825491,Posted: 29 March,all,Rephil,"HackyZack is a challenging experience that quickly becomes addicting as you progressively get better at the game. Tight, intuitive controls give you a level of flexibility in approaching each challenge, especially if you're going after the optional ""stickers"" you can collect in each stage (which in turn, unlock new characters to play as, each oozing with personality). The combination of figuring out each stage's puzzle while performing twitchy platforming results in a rewarding feeling each time you finish a level.The visual design is beautifully simple, with lovely pixel animations and ""chillout"" kind of atmosphere. Music is wonderful and does a great job at setting the tone for each of the various worlds you'll be playing through.If you love precision platforming that requires a tactical approach, then you'll surely dig HackyZack."

Seems easy enough but the direction you hit the ball and the direction you are moving is on the same analog stick. Each level also has an optional, really out of the way, sticker if you’re looking for more of a challenge. The ball's path is very predictable and the distance you can hit the ball from is mapped with a dotted line so every mistake is the player's. Restarts are quick and the soundtrack is great which helps mitigate frustration.This game is awesome, great pixel art, great gameplay, great music, well worth the price.Also there’s finally a character whose name is spelled the same as mine!"

As I'm writing this review I've only made it to world 3 and continue to love the new mechanics that are introduced at the start of each world.Not to mention the soundtrack is incredible. It makes missing the damn collectables much less frustrating because of the smooth downtempo sound."

,Recommended,508530,30889445,Posted: 1 April,all,illuminate,"I've followed Zack on twitter for as long as he's been showing tidbits of information and development updates of this game, and I'm beyond satisfied with the finished product.Pros:- Doesn't take too long to complete- High skill ceiling- Lovely music- Great feeling when you complete a level in one fluid string of motionsCons:- Personally, I wish there was a way to stand still and kick the ball, as opposed to moving all the time- The bumps in difficulty feel kinda rough (World 2 of the 5 I've played managed to give me the most trouble)- Can't back out to level select if you want to stop playing a level, you must go to the main menuOverall, I look forward to much more time spent in this lovely little craft and would hope you decide to support the wonderful developers behind it as well. Cheers!"

It may take a lot of practice to get any good at playing it, and I'm not nearly there yet, but it'd probably feel badass to be at that level.In the meantime, the chill music helps keep me sane after I've failed a level for the twentieth time. Luckily you're also not required to play the levels in each world sequentially, so you can hunt around for an easier stage if you're really stuck.As a platformer the controls are responsive and it feels good to move around, but the focus is really on manipulating the ball in each stage, which has its own physics and of course operates independently of the player character. So the challenge comes from not only learning to maneuver your character around the stage but also from directing and timing your kicks of the ball to precisely move it where you need it to go. It's a unique concept to build a game around and brings something new to the genre. Worth a shot."

,Recommended,508530,30816191,Posted: 29 March,all,SkyWolve,"HackyZack is a platformer that provides the satisfaction of figuring out how to approach a problem, and then trying to perfrom the solution over and over and eventually managing to pull it off. Lots of fun. The controls take a bit of figuring out as the movement keys and direction you're kicking keys are the same. Still a wonderful game."

,Recommended,508530,30953913,Posted: 4 April,all,Jeremy,Very chill and fun game. The music is relaxing and the concept of the game is simple while the process of reaching goals can be complex but not frustratingly so.

,Recommended,508530,32047496,Posted: 29 May,all,BarkingDoggy,"Pulling off tricks in HackyZack is so fun and gratifying, and there are so many mechanics + ball types. There's lots of content to keep you going, especially because target mode will probably take you years. There's cute characters to choose from as well. Did I mention the soundtrack's great? It's beautifully ambient and perfectly suits the game's theme. 9.5/10"
,Recommended,508530,32795635,Posted: 25 June,all,雪花牌电视机 SnowTV,"The first time I saw the trailer I know that this is gonna be a solid indie title with some of the most unique gameplay.But I didn't realize that a 2D platformer with kicking a ball around can be so hard!But hey, I don't regret buying this for $3.39 as it is on sale right now.And it really trains your finger dexterity, because you need to control your character and your ball seperately, you need to watch out what direction key you are holding constantly, and really memorize the jump and kick button in your muscle memory.I highly recommend this game to everyone who love 2D platformer games or anyone who loves challenging gameplay, because this game is very challenging, and the moment when you finally perfect every move to score the goal is one of the most satisfying thing you can get out of a video game."
,Recommended,508530,30815834,Posted: 29 March,all,Auf der Fritz,"I first saw footage of HackyZack at PAX 2017 on twitch, when they were having their Q&A and previewing the first couple levels. It definitely intrigued me in the originality of the game. After beating HyperLightDrifter recently, I needed more colorful intuitive indie games, and this one did not disappoint. Also has a bumpin' soundtrack!"

The gameplay is super tight and very well thought out. the sprites and color pallette are just the best. It can be quite difficult if you're trying for the collectables.

76561198027227141,Recommended,508530,35166646,Posted: 23 September,all,TwoToedTerror,"HackyZack is one of the most fun and challenging games I've played in a long time. It takes it's simple concept super far, and has the ""just one more level"" quality I don't find in games much anymore.Most impressive about this game is the fantastic difficulty curve. There are several levels that I spent quite a bit of time on during my first playthrough, but I never felt ""stuck"". The hard part is often figuring out the intended way to beat the level, and almost feels like a puzzle game during those moments. That never lasted more than a few minutes before I realized how to beat the level, and maybe another 5 to actually execute it.The final few levels will have you performing some insanely technical maneuvers that you never would have thought you could do at the start of the game. Before you know it, you beat the campaign. You would think it ends there, but somehow the game opens up into something even more fun and exciting.With your newly found platfomring abilities, you then go back to the beginning to get the bonus objects that are in each level. Doing so unlocks new characters to play as, but more importantly is just damn satisfying. Levels that I had lots of trouble with at first were a breeze the second time through - and that's with the added difficulty of getting the trinkets (some of which are very difficult).With each trinket you find in main levels, you unlock another level in ""Target"" mode where you have to hit various diamonds placed through unique levels as fast as possible - akin to ""Break the Targets"" in super smash brothers. Faster times get you star ratings between 1-3. This also has the same ""one more level"" quality where you obsess over getting that elusive third star. These levels are not filler content by any means. It's clear that Zack Bell put the ""Goal"" campaign as the focus of the game, but the target levels have a fantastic flow and direction.I enjoyed the developer's previous platformer INK, but this is clearly a step forward in terms of design and execution.I will say that if you don't have a controller, hold off till you get one. Some platformers you can get away with playing on a keyboard, but this one is NOT one of those. The speed and precision of inputs require to play this game makes it impossible to play without a controller.If you like indie games at all, I'd reccomend this to you."
