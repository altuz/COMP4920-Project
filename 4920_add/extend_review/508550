As it stands its a barebones game, which is understandable, but not worth buying in Early Access, at least not yet.

My heart was racing the whole time, never felt this paranoid and scared for my virtual life since Golden Eye 007 on the N64.The premise of the game is that you are a master(or in my case an ameteur) criminal that is supporting his/her survival/aspirations the only he/she knows how: By casing soft targets and robbing their owners blind there are a few ways and strategies to actualy pull off these risky endavours, some of them include the use of guns to neutralize threats such as security gaurds or concerned citizens, others rely on speed and cunning to swiftly snatch and run with your loot, or by careful planning and alot of patience, studying your environment and executing your plan flawlessly(after numerous attempts at trial and error to succeed in the first place ofcourse).I like the way you can actually progress from easy targets to missions that require more percision and planning. I got as far as the diamond heist before giving up to write this review.I highly reccomend this to anyone who's ever played stealth games, it's been a blast and though it's in alpha still it's still fun at this stage there were no major game-breaking bugs, most of them are ironed out actually though I must say that sometimes whenever I pick up the assault rifle the model for it disappears, but other than that little hiccup and a few pathing issues whenever a gaurd spots me by some stairs everything else seems to work fineIn terms of reccomendations and suggestions:-giving the gaurds more sound including footsteps and a voice would most likely make the game feel more alive-aside from giving gaurds voices and sound it would also be nice to have them glance through the glass panes from time to time such as the ones in the mansion-putting a meter that increases steadily as a gaurd becomes more aware of your prescence instead of having him spot you immediately would also be neat-It would also be a good idea to have them react to sounds including the dropping of glass bottles, platters aswell as sprinting-finally they need to react to opened doors and light aswell as ways to make it difficult to spot us with, again, lighting aswell as distance being factors of a potential spot.this game is still In alpha I'm excited as to what more will be added or what'll change, you can almost bet I'll accept the challenge."

There is also a glitch I found that I would like to point out. In the mansion and/or yacht levels, sometimes my AK-47 turns invisible. Other than that I would really reccommend this game to anyone no matter what PC they have, thanks to the wide variety of graphics setting choices in the start menu. I really want to see new levels and probably more game mechanics in the future, for example having the ability to punch and fight security guards and if other cops found a body they would be more alerted, something like that. I'm not demanding all this now but in the future this game should hopefully develop."
,Recommended,508550,25213357,"Posted: 28 August, 2016",all,T/B/T ᔕIᗰPLᗩYEᖇ,"This game is basically a criminal game. It is simular to the 'Unorginised Theif' but it has guns in the game. Unlike the 'Unorginised Theif' you don't need to rob important items in a checklist.Although this is a 'Early Access' game, you get to rob peoples stuff which will add to the money at the top of the screen. If you have enough money, you can go to your escape vehicle to finish the level. Normally in each level, there is a 'safe' or a 'vault' which will require a 'passcode' or a 'password'. You will have one try or multiple tries. If you fail, a alarm may be heard which then the owner or the gaurds will shoot you. Some safes or vaults may have traps like example, lasers or trip wires. Going through the lasers will trigger the alarm sound while the trip wires may kill you.I quite find this really fun. I would love it more if the creater puts more levels in the game but in the near future, it will be so much fun. The problem is thaf there a few glitches on this game that needs to be fixed.Overall, I give this an 8/10."

,Recommended,508550,24989987,"Posted: 18 August, 2016",all,GNA | Andi ^.^,I love this game! It has so much potential. The only problem I have is the framerate with a decent PC. I often drop under 60 FPS in the Mansion Level and further.. So when this is fixed and more levels will be added this is an amazing game and maybe some graphic improvements wouldn't hurt too! :)
,Recommended,508550,30115136,Posted: 23 February,all,Pow!eR,EDITED REVIEWPreviously I gave this game a negative review due to crashing issues and other annoying issues but reccently there was an update that has fixed my issues therefore I can now reccomend this. Big thanks to the developer for taking the time to respond to my issue!
,Recommended,508550,25688432,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,RizBoy-CFS,"Sneak Thief is amazing. It really feels like your in the position of one. I have played the Very Organised Thief a couple of times and I have to say, Sneak Thief is better. You can actually defend yourself in Sneak Thief rather than holding a box in front of you hoping the owner in TVOT won't notice you. You can also steal whatever you want rather than on a list.I would also like to recommend some things for the developer.I think the Cops are a bit overpowered. They just absorb bullets as if you chucked a plush toy at them. Maybe lowering the health of the Cops will make it balanced.I also don't like how as soon as one cop sees you, every cop on the level is hostile and somehow know where you are. Make it so the one guard that sees you, chases you. Not that all cops go complete berserk.A leaning mechanic will be awesome. It will give you a good advantage on harder heists where guards come from corners a lot.I also would like to see a silenced sniper rifle. Make it have a magnification scope and just to balance it make it very inaccurate when hip-firing (firing without scoping).I also am experiencing a bug. On the Collector level in a room where there's two gold plates in glass cabinets with a gold trophy in the middle of them. When I break the glass for the trophy and plate that's the furthest away from the entrance. The game stops working. Just wanted you to know so you can fix it.I give Sneak Thief a 9.9/10 because there is always room for improvement. Especially with an early access game.EDIT: Do not listen to the negative reviews. Those people don't realise that this is very early access, so of course there are bugs. The dev is active and takes ideas into account and he fixes bugs that lots of people experience (he fixed the Collector bug). And the potential this game has is huge and the dev promises a lot and probably will keep those promises.ANOTHER EDIT: They added a silenced sniper, but it needs fixing big time. The reticle in the scope doesn't line up properly. Now because I want to, some more suggestions-Fix the aimbot guards. I'm sick of them never missing a shot unless you're metres away and sprinting and crouching.-The guards seem to detect you from great distances and start shooting even if your not in range or if they are holding a weapon of high bullet spread. Specifically on the mansion level. Turning on your flashlight as soon as it starts, a cop will see you."

It makes the game feel more like you're a theif who needs to get all the intel to pull off the biggests score in history.Things that need fixing -I found that when you let go of the move button, the character would continue to move forwards instead of stopping. That got annoying pretty quickly.The AI are either too dumb or too aggressive at times. I found myself trying to hide from them but they still find me even if they didn't spot me. I'd fix the AI and the movement physics the most.Graphically, the game's character models need a lot of work as they look like dummies and can be kind of scary.Environments in some levels are bit too open and bland some of the time, and can usually distract players from the game.Things that could be added -I think giving players the ability to hide would be a great option, a peaking function would also benefit the game as it gives players that strategic edge against the AI.Going through secret passage ways to bypass security would be fun in some of the levels and using objects to block doors from being opened whilst you hack a security camera (I also think they should has Security Cameras into the game) would be neat.Really, I have to say that the game is fun but needs a lot of work.Would I recommend it? Not now, but it does have a lot of promise so I'd keep an eye on it if you're interested."

This game has no structure. Cash does nothing for you, completeing heists does nothing, you can get to the most difficult heist right away, and this looks like a game that you would find on a free flash game site.

,Recommended,508550,25293626,"Posted: 1 September, 2016",all,Doddy,Personaly i think this is one of the better indie games of 2016. The game is suprisingly immersive and i was suprised that i seemed to be the scared one. Although i like it there is still room for improvement. This includes a glitch where an npc who is chasing you gets stuck in a dorway. And where i think you should not be able to walk through npc's as it can ruin melee combat. I also think there should be an inventory section. BUt overall i think this is a great game and is definately worth the price. 8/10 for a recent version of the game.

,Recommended,508550,25812941,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,hilian,"Sneak Thief is an amazing game created by a dedicated dev. The game is fun and exciting, and honestly allows for much more intense stealth than I expected. The game encourages a quiet approach, but you're able to attack each level in multiple ways. For example, in the Home Invasion level you can either open the garage with a lever on the side, disable the security alarm, go in through the back door, or wait for the home owner to come home and follow him in. That's just the first, easiest level in the game.Performance-wise, the game runs decently well with occasional framedrops. I HIGHLY reccomend checking the minimum system requirements on the game and compare it to your computer's hardward before your purchase, as the game can be somewhat demanding at times and can even be unplayable if your computer is too 'slow'.In terms of community interaction (which is important for early access games), the dev constantly checks the forums and responds to questions, contributes to community discussions and posts updates daily. He even releases patches to fix individual's problems, which shows a lot of dedication to his fanbase.All in all, Sneak Thief is great. It's not too hard and can be breezed through in a few hours, and it doesn't have many amazing features (yet), but it's still damn good. Looking forward to see what this great concept turns into later on down the track."

Guard cannot be eluded or lost in anyway once detected, there also seems to be no way to distract them such as thrown items.  Multiple guards gave zero fugs to the pizza box cluttered deck of the ship.  You'd think they'd stop to investigate or something.   All weapons are ground pick ups, <b<do not believe the trailer you always start out unarmed. There is no melee takedown or self-defensive attacks</b>  If you get detected while being unarmed you're FUBAR.   I want to say you can sustain 4 to 6 gunshots prior to being killed, who knows there's no HP bar so there's really no way of knowing.I am not sure having only found a chef's knife on the home map if you were to find a similar quiet weapon if it would be any use, as there is no corpse disposal or drag mechanic.  Assuming that you managed to take down the target stealthfully, it took me like 3 or so slashes to kill someone, and that wasn't a guard.  Though considering how inattentive the guards seem to be with regards to things out of place who is to say they'd not just continue their patrols right over the corpses and blood-spatter.

So bad, it's actually kinda good.https://youtu.be/RpttNPwXTLUAt a glance, Sneak Thief resembles a very poor man's Payday or Payday 2. Upon closer inspection however, you'll soon realize that your initial assumptions were correct, and it is in fact a very poor man's Payday or Payday 2. The good news is however, that whilst this game is basic as balls, it still manages to be a LOT of fun. When I say the game is basic, I literally mean it in every aspect possible. The graphics are basic, the controls are basic, the mechanics are basic, the sound is basic, the premise is basic yet somehow, all these basic parts somehow manage to combine into some bizarre but enjoyable package.This game is a content creator's heaven, as we generally tend to gravitate towards strange, funny and broken games, and this one lends famously to ridiculous commentary eventuating from ridiculous situations.If you approach this game with anything beyond the expectations of having a good laugh, you'll most likely be disappointed. However, if you understand what the game is, what it's about and that the majority of its charm comes from how ridiculous it is, there's a solid chance that you'll have as good a time as I did playing it.Cheers :)"

Even when im at point blank, they still miss. Plus the guard's sight/view is WAY off, when im hiding behind cover COMPLETELY hidden they still spot me, these are the issues that i found the most annoying."

I can't see any benefits of the update except it takes your mouse pointer away unless you are escaped. Game gets real boring really fast. Has no substance. Just another EA walking simulator. Definetely not worth $10. If you catch it on sell for .99 it be worth buying.

Despite the bad optimization, use of simple unity engine with no further adjustments, crap level design, and bad AI, this game has no potential at all. The developer is mostly focused on adding new things instead of genrally improving the game. its a big zero from me. a waste of 10 dollars that couldve been spent on something much better. Not to forget this game has been on here for a really long time in which the dev did not even bother to read reviews and improve the game"

First of all, this company thought it was a good idea to release an unfinished map. The enemies have aim bot. The trip wire mines sound like the guns. Literally I stuck a shotgun to the back of a guards head and it still didn't kill him. Why cant you start out with a gun? Why is the same code used in two maps? Plus why is the game called Sneak Theif when the entire game is not sneaking?! Also, the idea of having one try on a safe is BS and the aiming is a little off. This game should at least be free. Terrible god awful waste of 10 DOLLARS!"
