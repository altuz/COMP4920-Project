Normally that would mean a do not recommend from me, but that's because I generally use a ""dollar per hour"" pricing scheme for games, and well, you can't argue with one dollar.The coding is solid, the graphics adorable, and the mechanics easy to grasp. There's not a tutorial beyond a help menu with a few tips, but it's simplistic enough that an astute gamer doesn't need that. I could have left it in the default russian and still had a general idea of what I was doing and where I was going.If you're a parent wanting to buy something a 3-10 year old can enjoy an evening with, this <100MB game is definitely it. It also drops steam cards, so if you're into that it's cheaper than a booster pack for the gems and tradable value you get out of it.All around I rate this game candybar out of ten, because it's sweet, enjoyable but brief, and only a dollar. Go get yourself a RODbar, you deserve it."

Part of the strategy is choosing when to flip your tiles during a fight.Your base needs oxygen and adding more people requires adding more trees to compensate for oxygen usage.  In fast mode people use more oxygen than normal.  People fight melee, but if there are defense towers, then they battle first before any melee takes place.  You'll need a warehouse to collect stone, wood, chests, or fuel and then choose what other buildings (hospital, armory, artifact house, shields, trees, walls, offensive towers).  Chests are opened with keys.Gameplay consists of flying your base from node to node through space, where nodes are either enemy bases, enemy super-bases, repair nodes, stores or treasure.  Enemy bases either wait to be attacked or attack immediately.  There are 6 enemy super-bases, and conquering them unlocks new weapons.  When all 6 super-bases are destroyed the game is won.Pros:- Combines game mechanics from the following genres: Tower defense, Roguelike, 4x- Randomized maps- Artifacts- Early game tension- Every enemy base you wipe out opens new weapons, which adds some variety.Cons:- No save.  I have beaten the game both in easy and hard modes in one sitting perhaps under an hour.  So the lack of saving is not as bad as you might think.- The tension seems to wear off later- There are still some bugs- The game defaults to Russian and it's tricky to get it into English again.  It's sort of an introductory mini-game ""decipher the language to find out the English setting"" :)- The game gets pretty grindy near the end.  Not being able to save is a big minus.Is it worth $1?No it's worth $2 or $3 - maybe even $5 after it's polished.  Get it while it's cheap and buy 3 copies to share with your friends!Is it better than many games you pay $50?Of course not!  Why would you think that?  Whenever you pay more money you automatically enjoy the game that much more.  Especially when titles are developed by armies of people and all of them are throwing each other under the bus and the bugs are left to the player base to catch and gripe about in the forums.  Actually this game (as far as gameplay goes) is at least as good as many higher end titles (like Civilization for example).Is it fun?I think so.  But buy it yourself and find out!  Get a refund if you don't like it before 2 hours are up.  I think it's well worth the time to give it a try."

I bought it because the game description reminded me of the flying cities from James Blish's _Cities in Flight_ written in  the 1950s.Gameplay consists of constructing items in your flying city and travelling to different star systems. Star systems can contain a store, a repair center or another flying city. One can harvest resources at another flying city; sometimes this involves slaughtering the locals.The game appears to be developed by a Russian or Ukrainian (sorry, I can't read the Cyrillic alphabet well-enough to distinguish between the two languages), but the instructions are clear enough. For the price, it's a reasonable game."
,Not Recommended,508600,26296802,"Posted: 29 October, 2016",all,Lin,"And here I sit staring at the upvote/downvote buttons, really confused as to why I'm almost tempted to upvote this game. Cause the thing is, I kinda enjoyed playing it. Despite the fact that it looks, feels and plays like a game prototype at its early stages. Its strategy is puddle deep, none of the gameplay elements go anywhere, the game progression is completely unbalanced, and once you understand what on earth it is you're supposed to be doing, the only thing left is to hop from star to star till you reach all the circled stars and get the black screen of deflating victory.And I still found it charming. Even though the gameplay is horribly repetitive, the UI makes student projects look fancy, someone forgot to add a save option, and there are very basic design and/or execution mistakes. Like treasure maps that consistently lead you to completely empty stars, teaching you never to trust pirates ever again. Or like how you can lose the game by having too many people and not enough oxygen - and by having no way to get rid of people or generate more oxygen. Which, I have to say, almost added tension to the game for a second there. Till I decided to just sent my minions into combat without any turret or hospital support, killing half my city along with them in a desperate suicide mission of incompetence.Not that destroying the city mattered. After scrambling to get set up in the very (very) early game, you soon realise that you have tons of resources and absolutely nothing to spend them on. So you hop here, and hop there, not fighting enemies, not collecting resources, just trying to figure out whether the next star will get you any closer to the end game, all with the creeping suspicion that there really is no end game. (Hint: There isn't.)The question remains: Why was I entertained by this barely half baked project? I'm honestly wondering. There are some good design ideas somewhere in there for sure. The random maps can make the early game entertaining, for a short while. Also the star map is strangely fascinating - hopping from star to star just feels... satisfying somehow. And that's pretty much all I can come up with.Maybe I was just in the mood for an odd lil alpha build of a game. If you are too, maybe buy it anyway. Personally, I'm not willing to recommend it - low price alone does not a good game make. But hey, what do I know? You wonna trust someone who found this trainwreck oddly charming? :)"

While I did not buy NMS because I dont care about hype and I would never spend $60 on a fully procedural indie game, I saw ROD for rediculously low price of $1. Based on the price, I had no expectations of this game actually being good. I was pleasantly surprised. ROD is not only good, but it has some amazing and unque systems that separate it from anything else I have ever played. Its an interesting mix of tower defense, rogue-like, exploration and resource management. Good music, solid design and and twist of mystery make ROD the best deal I have seen in a long time. GG!"

The content may have been a bit easy, and ingame economy could use some work, ie im fairly sure there are more chests than there are keys in the game.There may not have been that many ideas, and very little that was new to gaming, however many if not most of them were very well exicuted. With work and a larger team, and more resources, this could easly be made into a very vast and full game.

I finished the game in both easy and hard modes, and it can certainly be done despite there being no save game option.I have left a lot of feedback that I think can improve the game, and the dev has been responsive.I have high hopes that this game will be great in future. Right now it's good, but it has a ton of potential.There's a lot of randomness in the game, which I think makes it more fun. Fuel isn't a problem, but it's definitely tough to balance the other resources.I found it's best to explore a bit at the start, and then complete the mission. First time I played, I explored a ton at the start, but that made the late game very tricky as the number of enemies you fight seems to be related to the number of times you've moved since the start of the game. If this is balanced a bit more, then you can easily use multiple strategies. For now, especially considering the lack of a save game feature, playing quickly is definitely best!It's certainly an interesting combination of turn based and realtime strategy, plus of course there's some tower defense elements. There's no mazing involved, but there's several types of turrets that can be levelled up.Overall, I certainly recommend this game."

The people would run back and forth on the spot which meant that it took much longer for me to do anything as my people wouldn't respond.

,Recommended,508600,24911509,"Posted: 14 August, 2016",all,Neverwhere Knight,"Well, well, well.This one is an interesting one indeed. Basic premise of the game is thus; you're a space faring fortress, on a mission to eradicate a virus of some sort (which I only learned from the game over screen, har de har.). You cruise around the galaxy visiting stars which either contain resources (resource gathering, management), settlements which must be attacked and defeated (tower defence time, ya'll.) in order to claim their resources, and finally stores, which allow you to buy extra resources, repair kits etc., or repair stations that allow you to repair and upgrade your towers. This continues until you have a force capable of taking on a-la 'boss' settlements.So.The game is pretty fun, in a play windowed whilst watching YouTube in the backround sort of way. The graphics are simple and unoffensivce. The soundtrack is surprisingly fitting and unobtrusive, given the price tag. The gameplay is very happy clicky don't think too hard sort of fare.However.It needs work. It be a little buggy, occasionally you'll begin a new game, and resource platforms won't load in. Speeding up time (which allows your little minions to collect resources, fight, etc. quicker) often causes your citizens to run backwards and forwards helplessly. But nothing that won't be easily fixed, I suppose.There really isn't a whole lot of content. It's going to get old really fast without a stream of updates adding more stuffings.There isn't a save feature. This needs sorted. I can't sugar coat it.However.I got this for eighty pence. You may as well give it a shot.Also, click the flag on the lower right of the title screen, unless you can read Russian ;)Peace."

,Not Recommended,508600,30522864,Posted: 15 March,all,Xilux,"Originally, I did think of upvoting this for a recommendation. It entertaining and amusing. Warning: Unity Game.There's a little hurdle as a learning curve. When you first start, ""Pausing"" the game will give you a little hint as to how this game works. So here's an insider, and I hope some of you guys can upvote this to make it visible for other readers. It will greatly help.So when you start the game, this is very vital. You need to start with only 1 Warehouse (which is free to make or destroy), and jump straight to making turrets. Creating the ""Tools"" building will help you apparently ""double"" your resources obtained. Now this is very important. You have 2 sides of this world-spaceship thing of yours. You can hit the first button bottom left to flip the board. You'll want to design one for internal economical and infrastructure, and the flip side will be your battlefield.For your economical, I recommend building everything you need here. And right away, I'm going to rate each building to save you time of wondering what they do.1. Tree: Provides your colony with oxygen. One is good enough for maybe 3-5 people. It only cost 1 tree resource, so do not hesitate to spam these on your economical board.2. Wall: These are meant to protect your other buildings. These must be placed on the edge and corners. The AI generally hits the closest building. They cost 10 stone, so this one I really wasn't a fan of. These things eat damage hard. It takes 5 hits to destroy. Meanwhile, a turret can eat twice as much damage for 10 tree and 10 stones. There's a better means of defense and I'll detail that later...3. Shield: Meant to protect your buildings. This thing doesn't even work right, it's as useful as a wall (NOT THAT USEFUL)4. Warehouse: This is your key building. You'll want to centralize this thing if possible. It doesn't really matter though, because your warehouse cost nothing to build, and it does not affect stock destroying this thing. I use it on the edge to eat enemy turret damage for free.5. Armory: This one I have mixed feelings about. Early game, you're not gonna really care about this. All it really does is give your men an ""attack"" or ""defense"" option. It lets your regular people who are not sitting in turrets invade the enemy territory. They make short work of the enemy towers and eventually mid game, you will have them fight the enemy defenders to officially win.6. Tools: These claim to double your mined/gathered resources. Not tested. I build it just in case.7. Artefacts: This will be your most important building. Occasionally, you will find chests that can be opened only by keys bought from random space ""Stores."" You can equipt up to 6 modifiers that influence building health, turret damage, people health, people damage.8. Hospital: Heals your little men after each battle is over, not recommended.Too long, didn't read it? Just build the Warehouse and Turrets. Trees to make your people breathe. Everything else doesn't matter.Initial Strategy:1. Build 4 Turrets centralized on one side. I always go for the most expensive ones. For our purpose, we'll call this side B.2. Build a ring of trees on side B all around the edge. Remember how we discussed that the walls were utter trash? Well... apparently in space, mother nature is a far sturdier wall. These trees can eat as much enemy fire as a turret. We're using these trees to not only bring in much needed oxygen, but they're gonna be our main line of defense. With this, we should be good for 20-30 men.3. Add your warehouse to side B. Since it will be further out compared to your turrets, this warehouse gets to eat enemy turret fire for zero cost if we ever need it to.4. On Side A, you will need to build Tool for now. When you find your first artifact, then build ""Artefact"" (Which by the way is flipping stupid to spell wrong in one place and not the other...5. Before moving into new territory, it is a good idea to put your 4 men into these turrets. When you visit new planets, your enemy will either be A. Sleeping, B. Neutral, or C. Hostile. They will start shooting you.6. From where you first start, travel around your start point. I've found that your initial start point has much needed crew-members or settlers that are waiting to be found. When you reach too far into space, I've only managed to find 10 total. But when I started a new game and hit all the local places, I've found 12-20 early.Key to winning:- Do not set to closest fire, Fire at RANDOM, this is absolutely vital. You don't want 16 turrets firing at one enemy turret at a time when 4 bullets makes one go boom. While you randomly fire at turrets, they're firing at your trees.- Don't build walls, build trees- Turns out fuel is free, you click a button to ""Gather Fuel"" when you hit 0- Always upgrade your turret to max ASAP, resources are hard to comeby early game, money isn't- Purchase keys and repair packs each chance you get- Mid to late game, purchase and keep stock 5-10 Medkits, 10-20 Repair Packs, 10-20 Keys- Med Kit is more useful than a Hospital, I generally use 1 after each major battle- Repair Pack cost MUCH LESS than going to a ""Repair"" spot and spending money per damage- After you have the necessary stock, and you are hitting your surplus of 500-1000 gold, start buying crewmen- Add more turrets at this point, upgrade ASAP- Capture the 6 points and win the game- As you progress, the game will add more buildings, weapons, and upgrade the enemy, just beat the game before hitting all the bluesNow... why am I rating this poorly?Well first off, your trees work like your walls should. Resources need adjustment. The beginning, you have almost nothing to work with, and later on, all the settlers are dead, you have too much resources late game. But the best part is there's a list of bugs.Bugs:- Your citizens go nuts after each battle and mid game, they never gather resources. The lil buggers go raid the enemy homes, sit in there, sip on a nice cool can of figurative beer, and forget to come out. Go figure the life of a space pirate makes you a lazy buttmunch. Simply recall them to bring them back.- When you travel to some places, you just bug the hell out. It doesn't load properly. It's fine though, I can afford one or two. But when you bug out every 1/3 treasure locations, and steal a ton of resources from me after I traveled across the entire galaxy, I'm gonna be ticked off. This was before I knew fuel was free and didn't give me a Game Over. I was paying 10 gold per fuel just to make it across... Which brings me to my next point.- WHY IS FUEL FREE?!- Oxygen... It bugs out. When you have around 20-30 people or more, you begin to bug out on Oxygen. It happens drastically when you turn up your speed. Your Oxygen will magically dip severely when your little men raid the enemy. I mean... why... do they breathe more heavily while engaged... cause that would be cool, a little RP... but I think this developer just... know what, let's just say he's smart and gave it a little roleplay...- Jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams, in our case, Laser Beams (Yes, there are laser beams late game) doesn't melt trees!!!- Oh right, the ultimate reason why I'm super♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ You bugged 1 out of 6 of my key victory points and never gave me a proper bloody victory. I was lit-ter-ral-ly ONE EFFING stop from winning. I thought to myself, ""Oh bloody hell... the enemy are starting to build Anti-Personnel camps and rocket turrets... better just skip everything and race to win the game, shall we?"" So I race across the Galaxy to capture all 6 points, skipped 7 treasure locations, and I encourage my men for the final battle, ""This is it men... we have fought long and hard with our 62 men... this is our final battle... To Victory!!!"" but the game said, ""No""We marched into the final stop. We only saw our own base. The game said, ""No.""I said 2 words... then one more, ""DOWNVOTE"""

Basically build up the strength of your battle platform by visiting different planets for resources, then when strong enough destroy the baddies. Upgrades however are a bit limited.Biggest gripe is the fact there is no ingame saves. You either play it thru in one sitting, or have to restart from scratch.

ROD is a macro kinda game where you have a platform you build on that can flip, one side for living and other for fighting..I think. You have to learn how to get you people into and out of your defenses to collect resources until you have a high enough poopulation they can just stay in the defense towers. the point of the game is to fight 6 different worlds that have all their tiles fileld with defense towers, you prety much can take one out when you have one side completely covered in defense, and at that point you cna take the other 5 out. each of the 6 are any more difficult than another but they unlock more towers, the most usefel one you ge tis anti personel for the rare occasion.Going to the store allows you to buy resouces on a page and other game usefil items like keys or fuel and repair kits or people. always buy keys, sometimes people early on. the repair stations alow you to do just that AND upgrade your defenses. sometimes you find treasure maps and those lead to a large amount of resources like rock, tree or fuel, I havent found a map for people, money or treasure.tips to play would be to hit the play button to fast forward everything, always travel with your defense up and living down. defense only on one side, everything else on the other. 1 tree works for 13 people. Artifacts are items you equip to a artifact tower to give bonuses to your people, buildings etc.in summary this game is like a child of FTL:faster than light and the game Mountain."

Chests can contain anything from 1 credit to an ""artefact"".

By the time you get a hang of the rather uncreative mechanics, you've probably already seen all there is to see in the entire game. There are three different types of planets: Repair planets, Resource planets, and Store planets. You get resources to build weapons on your ship, fight other ships, repair your weapons, rince, wash and repeat. Stores just get you resources you're too unlucky to find enough of.That's pretty much the entire game. Spend a buck for an hour (or in my case, less) of decent yet repetitive gameplay with little to no niches. Would only reccomend to people with some pocket change and a little bit of time to kill or for badge building, as it only requires 5 cards per badge."

The random star map, the varied towers (unfortunately the only useful one seems to be the minigun tower), as well as minor resource gathering/saving mechanics (forcing you to decide what to build/upgrade next).However, the game lacks depth. Most of the challenge is derived from learning how to play the game. After that, it's just rote. You'll spend most of your time pressing the fast forward button and waiting (while watching your dudes go around and do things). That isn't what I consider to be fun.Overall, I'd recommend getting this game only if you have more money than sense, to support someone brave enough to try to make something new."

The worst part of the game is the simple UI that gives you so little information you'll basically going to be guessing on nearly everything you attempt to do.You play as a floating platform that goes from star to star either getting resources or fighting other floating platform cities, and that is it. You barely have to do anything but click a ton and it gets old fast. Without any other controls other than mouse if you've got any muscle problems related to excessive small movements this game will cause you pain!Pros:+Simplistic, yet effective art style.Cons:-No save function at all-No frame rate limits meaning your CPU is gonna fry itself-No depth-No strategy-Mouse only control means excessive clicking that the keyboard could have handled-Does not have replayability as store description says-Simply does not bring enough to the table-Game starts in Russian-UI is too simple, does not give enough information"

If this game gets a save, my review changes to a thumbs up! It can be completed rather quickly, my first try was around 30 mins on easy and I was taking my time.Too easyThis game is really, really far too easy even on hard. It would be nice to get a new game mode where boss levels are much, much harder.There is no real point to getting multiple turret types, I completed it with trees, single and double turrets and a couple anti troop turrets in about 30 mins on easy mode and I was taking my time.I only used the Lazer, chaingun and rocket launcher for pure novelty on my next playthrough on hard, although I wouldnt have needed to.---Still overall I enjoyed playing this game although I fear with no save I dont see the point in playing.

No tutorial, confusing instructions, no depth, and no real measure of progression outside of grinding for resources. Options and controls are likewise severely limited and access to them also is limited. If you must buy, try to get it on sale.Full Review:Simply put, this game feels like only half a game. There is no tutorial system at all. There are a few snippets of text under a help button accessible that is only accessible once a game session is started. These text items could fit on half a screen instead of the five buttons they occupy, and only vaguely hint at what parts of the map objects do. The player is left to figure out how to play on their own through trial and error or through searching the Internet if another player was kind enough to write a how-to guide.Settings and options are likewise hidden within the active game session and not on the main menu. There are only two settings available: Audio and one graphical. One should expect separate sliders for sound effects and background music, but sadly, there is none. On top of that, the game does not remember what was set, making the player reset any changes they made between sessions.There are buttons in the game's user interface that do nothing when clicked. (I'm still trying to figure out how to access the treasure chests I've collected in game.) Shops do not explain what they do. I clicked the buy button not sure if I was getting a resource or a building since they both use the same icon sets.The gameplay is simple. Click on the flight (rocket engine) button. Select a blue dot that is connected to the dot you are on to fly to it. Click on the door to fight if there are enemies and then click on the same door again to capture resources. There are a couple of special icons on the flight map that I didn't try due to not understanding how the game is played beyond what I just wrote. The flight map offers no advice or help on deciding what dot to go to, since it's a crap shoot what dot is picked.  So, it is entirely possible to click a map laden with hostiles and have a fledgling colony wiped clean.While the main menu is very plain and barely functional, at least the in-game user interface and game grid looks nice. The art style is minimalistic, but still very attractive. The concept of having a flying home base that docks to other land masses with two sides to the floor is also a very interesting concept, although it feels very incomplete. The player is to build a base that both functions as a resource collector and attack/defend. While using two sides of the same map/game grid to develop the only strategy element of the game, letting the player put any building/resource on any side of any tile with no instructions or help leaves the player in a situation where their base cannot do either resource collection and/or battle with any effectiveness."

Then 10 minutes into the game I was destroyed by the huge bases near the center. 10/10Try playing the game (if its your first time playing) in Russian. Also if you do not want Russain click the Russian flag in the main menu. Great game for a dollar.Edit: Be very careful of the bases you need to beat to win. The picture is not lying about how many turrets are there xd
