Not even an entertainment software. Or anything at all.It's on (was) sale for 16 cents. Not much for a game, but expensive for nothing.At least SAMOLIOTIK had a (bad) sense of humour.Who let these games released on Steam?- No real gameplay- Ugly graphics (not retro)- No music (and bad quality sound)- No options- Not entertaining.+ 0.16€ on sale+ CardsIt's a slob product."

,Not Recommended,508670,29853697,Posted: 11 February,all,mighty hawk | TradeSkinsFast.com,"As a gamer, I can not make myself recommend this. Only get this for the Trading Cards and the XP. Even the arcade machines of the 80's were better than this. I have a small Donkey Kong mini arcade thing that my father got as a child, and that's better than this. I will list all the cons here.Cons* EXTREMELY LOUD SOUND. Seriously, my ears are almost bleeding. With my sound set to 10, I still had to take off my headset. And I could still hear it!* NO OPTIONS. What game has no options? Seriously?* STUPID RESOLUTION. Because the game has no options or settings, I can't change the resolution to fit my monitor. It's only half the screen that's used, the rest is just white.* When you die, everything is reset, except from your score. What game let's you boost your score infinitely?* Many others, trust me, don't get this game.There are no prosTrading CardsIf I have to name ONE pro, it's the Trading Cards. I got this game on the Winter Sale 2016 for 0,15€. Each Trading Card has a value of 0,06€ (as the the 11th Febuary 2017). You'll get 3 card drops. Because of Steam taking some of the money you make from selling on the Market, you'll only get around 0,05€ per card. This means that I will be able to make 0,15€ off of a game that I spent 0,15€ on. Which means, that this is basically free 7 XP for your Steam profile. Off course there is the miniature chance of getting a Booster Pack or a Foil Card drop, which will make this more valuable.ConclusionDon't buy this game. Not even for the Trading Cards. Unless you're able to get it for free or for less than 0,10€, don't get it. It's not worth it. Trust me."

You have to shoot incoming enemies with rockets and avoid enemies bullets. You have a health bar at the top left and your score is there too. You can't fly all the way to the other side and you will be blocked mid way by an invisible barrier. So your movement is pretty limited. Your ship will automatically fire whenever an enemy is coming.. You will see powerups flying on your way. but these are incredible small to see. Whenever you are firing a rocket, you will use all of your rocket ammo. Even if you press the button once and there is 4 rockets at the top.  All of these 4 rockets are gone.No tutorial, manual or whatsoever.No music.Annoying repetitive sound.Super monotone/repetitive gameplay.Looks really cheap/no impression.No pause button.Other things.Don't really see a reason to buy it.. Not even for trading cards.-------------------I Give this game a 1/10"
