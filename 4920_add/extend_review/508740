76561198138967991,Recommended,508740,32815456,Posted: 26 June,all,satie-san,"Wheels of Aureliais a neat little game with great replay value. However, it is best appreciated in small doses. As said by other reviewers, it is much more a narrative-driven experiment than a racing game, but there are some endings and achievements that ask for the player to have good reflexes and race other cars. The dialogue is surprisingly rich and becomes more interesting after having finished three or four playthroughs (which last between 15 and 20 minutes each), as the player begins to put the pieces together and can focus on the characters instead of the road.Wheels of Aureliamay have a particular resonance with Italian or italophile people, but as someone who doesn’t know much about the history of the country, I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about some of the emblematic figures and political struggles of Italy in the 70s. And needless to say, the soundtrack and art are really unique and aesthetically pleasing !In conclusion, I would recommend this game to people who favour choices and dialogue over reflexes and speed, and advise those who are not convinced by their first playthrough to at least complete several others before giving their final verdict."
,Not Recommended,508740,25774846,"Posted: 29 September, 2016",all,constantcompile,"I wanted to like this game - the music in the trailer is amazing, the setting is a rarely seen one, and the characters seemed unique.Unfortunately, the in-game music is less remarkable, the dialogue is railroaded so tightly that the characters feel one-dimensional instead of complex, and the branching story paths feel completely arbitrary - it seems at least half of them require you to unceremoniously ditch your passenger. Also, even if you've seen a cutscene before, you can't skip it, or even speed it up - this makes unintentional trips down the same story path boring and frustrating, and there's no real way to tell which turns will and won't uncover new content.All of that could be forgiven if the gameplay were fun, but... it just isn't. The collision geometries will often have you colliding with invisible hitboxes, the ""autopilot"" doesn't work well enough for you to rely on it, and the frequently obscured road means you will often rear-end unseen traffic.The car's velocity occupies the distinct territory of ""too fast to stay in the right lane, too slow to pass in the oncoming lane reliably,"" and there are no brakes. You can stop for passengers, but the controls don't give you any way to slow the car. So if you have three cars in front of you in the right lane and three cars coming at you in the left lane, you're either going to rear-end the car in front of you or sideswipe multiple cars while lane-sharing.The result is a buggy, unsatisfying game that seems to fail at everything it sets out to do. The setting is interesting, to be sure, but I feel that exploring it isn't worth sinking several hours into such frustrating gameplay."

It's very much interactive fiction done pretty, the backdrop of 70s Italy is interesting and the stories vary nicely depending on the choices made.  Whilst a run through can be completed in 15-30 mins, there are a number of different stories and endings to find.By no means is it a driving game though, avoid it if that's what you're looking for, the driving is a means to explain the story/stories and little more.The art style is nice and the soundtrack is great."

It has a somewhat nostalgic atmosphere and the music is good, as is the concept. A driving background - and it is very much in the background as a vehicle ;) for a conversation game set on the coast of Italy is just, well, cool. But the conversations aren't in and of themselves interesting. It's frustrating because the conversation themes are rich with potential, but aren't explored. this game doesn't really know what it is, and because it can't commit, it falls short at most of what it does."

76561197992985917,Recommended,508740,25629147,"Posted: 21 September, 2016",all,SmithDoc,"Wheels of Aurelia is something quite special - I've played it for a little over an hour, having completed it four times with four different endings (apparently there are sixteen) and I still feel driven to play it again, to discover more possibilities, as well as enrich my understanding of the lead character, the driver Lella, and her hitchhiker Olga (there are many passengers whom I can pick up along the way, who are also fascinating, but as the game always starts with Olga accompanying me, I feel the strongest attachment to her).While the game is, at its heart, a simple driving game set against a beautiful coastal backdrop, the game it reminds me of the most is Papers, Please. While Papers, Please was set in a fictional time and place, it effectively evoked the struggling post-Soviet States of the late 80's-early 90's - its social insights felt non-fiction. With Wheels of Aurelia, which takes place in Italy in the 1970's, you get that same level of social ambience, that feel that the story and characters are caught up in a tide of history. And critically, you'll feel the need to play it repeatedly to uncover more of the story, as Lella interacts with everyone a little differently depending on the person and the vehicle.Concerning the gameplay: the driving is fun, but simple. Of the cars you can choose from, or win (via illegal street race challenges), each has its own distinctive character. Even though great pains have clearly been made to make driving easy -stopping for anything is accomplished automatically, for instance, and your car always re-aligns itself, unless you're accelerating- it's nice to see that some attention was paid to making the vehicles diverse enough that each lends a different feel to the game.Gameplay also involves branching dialogue, which plays out simultaneously with driving - you can choose to ignore any conversation, of course, and keep your attention on the road, but that might upset your passenger! Both driving and dialogue are accomplished via the arrow keys, keeping the interface very tight and as undistracting as possible.If you can't tell, I thought this game was excllent and I hope it gets the attention it deserves. Kudos to the developers for this fresh, stylish and thoughtful game."

I have a few minor quibbles with it here and there, but it succeeded in making me feel like I was a rebellious youth on the streets of late 70s Italy, so I can forgive them."

,Recommended,508740,33256098,Posted: 4 July,all,LiteraryHell,"Oh my god! I was really on the fence for buying this game before the steam sale, but when I saw the price drop I bought it immediately. I was right to! I've gotten only 5 of the 16 endings so far, but geez, this game is great.It might seem like a very small game, but, as I mentioned before, it's got 16 ending, and each playthrough is about 15 minutes. The only games I've found myself to replay this often (notably Thirty Flights of Loving) are those with a great story, and this game has that in spades.Get this game if you like something short, but replayable, and with a really great story!Slight story spoilers aheadYou play as Lella, a, tbh, cool-as-all-heck lady, and a friend she's only just met. Both of them get on adventures ranging from racing to discussing life, to, if you feel like it, some very sapphic events.You can even change your car up, changing what people say in the story."

Evocative art and funky music provide the backdrop to an intriguing narrative game. And this is definitely a *narrative* game first and foremost; the driving mechanics are secondary and unintrusive (you're navigating a conversation tree while steering your car, and it doesn't feel overly complicated). The dialogue is a bit on-the-nose in parts, but the structure does require characters to be introduced, developed, and resolved rather quickly, and it's successful at that. Definitely worth a look!"

You play as Lella, an independent woman who one day decided to drive to the disco, pick up another woman, and go on a road trip to France. You experience a slice-of-life in Italy in 1978, optionally picking up hitchikers and interacting with the politics and events of the times.The main replay value of the game is in trying to find all the different endings. As you learn more about Lella and her new friends, you find yourself wanting to find the happiest possible endings for all of them."

76561198173606567,Not Recommended,508740,33984781,Posted: 2 August,all,KeinSchiesse,"This game is all style and no substance. While it deserves to be applauded for trying something new and experimental, its gameplay and systems are so minimal that it matches more of what may be seen in an old Atari game or experienced via a film, with the very passive gameplay consisting of for the most part veering left and right on a highway as your indestructible car typically will always only need to drive straight ahead, at one of two speeds. At certain moments you can choose to pick up various hitchikers or not, which provide for more dialog exchanges, but beyond that the gameplay consists of all just driving along a highway and selecting dialog responses to your passengers.The game is more of a somewhat docile, dialog-centric experience, with the enjoyment from the title deriving mostly from how you choose to respond to the other character's dialog and seeing how they react. Despite the weight of some of the game's dialog (abortion, running away from personal problems, etc...) I never found myself caring much about any of the characters. The game's presentation is very unique in that it mostly all takes place via the car rides being depicted and the portraits of the main character and another passenger going back and forth in dialog. The game hasmultiple endings (16?? according to the ending screen?)which may lead to some replay value, and I'm guessing these are unlocked by selecting different responses to the dialog, taking characters to where it is they'd like to go, etc.I enjoyed some of what the game offers, and it has some introspective moments whether through the silence one finds in a car ride or a surprising exchange of dialog with someone you didn't expect to meet, but the game is also just art mimicking reality at that point, and while its illustrative style is appealing and its very limited gameplay is unique, I can only say I'm glad I checked the game out on sale as I've been interested in it, but I don't think I would say others ""need"" to experience it by any means. I would only recommend this game to people that find its visual style appealing and can tolerate extremely limited, near nonexistent gameplay in the traditional sense. The game will still immerse you in moments it presents, but its default asking price of 9.99 is somewhat high.I still enjoyed some of what the game presents, its cool visual style, and a chill atmosphere, but I also found it to be pretty pointless as a game, and think it may have been better suited as a film. At only a half an hour for my first playthrough, I may still go through another time to see more of the content/characters/endings, but at the same time I think having already gone through and seeing what it does once it may be a diminishing return of caring to do so."
,Not Recommended,508740,29510405,Posted: 26 January,all,Goujon John,"What a load of old nonsense. There is only one reason to play this game - if you like learning about the politics and history of 70s Italy. This is barely a game at all - I've added the tag ""visual novel"".The driving is ridiculous. You can literally turn the car so it's facing the wrong way and you'll still get pushed along rails. There are seemingly no penalties or consequences for smashing the car into other cars or the guard rails.The art style is quite nice, but it wears thin quickly.You can complete this game in less than 30 minutes. There are multiple endings but I'm not sure I can be bothered."
,Not Recommended,508740,33602226,Posted: 17 July,all,whitegreyblack,Not much of a game. You can start the game and not touch another control for 25 minutes and the game will actually play itself from start to finish (though there are several different endings should you feel the need to play through it several times).   Ths would be okay if the game told a compelling story; which in my opinion it does not.
