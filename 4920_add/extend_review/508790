The level design is out the roof in terms of quality, as are the controls, the bosses, the sound, etc.Playing it solo it's amazing, but where it really shines is when you get together with 3 other friends and start battling it out in the many multiplayer modes (also has co-op).TL;DR : It's amazing, buy it."

I was with friends and we have been playing more than 10 hours all night.This game It's super fun. It looks simple at the first view, but it have a lot of differents game mechanics.The bosses are incredible, each one it's different and you need to think how to beat it.Super recommended."

76561197971330003,Recommended,508790,25566445,"Posted: 18 September, 2016",all,Particlese,"I got this based on the RPS article and the Steam store page videos, and I'm pretty pleased so far.  At least as far as partway through world 3 (of 6, at the moment), the challenge on offer increases over the course of each world, introducing new applications of movement, new obstacles, and new twists/combinations of all of those, and it does so at a rate that for me is doable but constantly engaging.  Maybe a little too quickly at a couple points, but it's not boring, and for me it's stayed on the good side of frustration.  One key thing is that it doesn't abandon the ideas that it spends time building up, so while I'd love to see more levels concentrating on a single idea or set of ideas, you do get to keep applying and altering what you've learned as you go along.Control-wise, keyboard and mouse is still feels like a work in progress in terms of UI, but it's plenty good enough for the first two worlds.  Controls are pretty much spot-on with a gamepad, and definitely preferred, as the dev clearly states.  :)Overall, I had not expected this level of polish in an early acess game.  (I typically access games late or vaguely on time.)  I hear there are bugs, and some UI and death sequences feel slightly too drawn out to me, but this is early access, and it already feels really good and is a fun challenge.  Read about it, give it a look in motion, and if you're intrigued, try it!"

,Recommended,508790,25758314,"Posted: 28 September, 2016",all,redorav,"I don't normally spend time writing game reviews (I normally spend it playing) but I'll make this just one exception as it is such a wonderfully polished, minimallistic, delicately balanced, challenging, and overall fun game that I just couldn't resist.The game starts off with zero tutorials, and the player needs to discover the controls, what they do, how they respond, etc. After that, levels start going at you one after another as you struggle to complete the objective (which you discover on-the-fly so to speak, just as you jump to the next level)You plough through the roughly first ten levels learning the basic mechanics so that you can finally confront the epic boss. On your way you learn about the arrows, the bomb arrows, the lasers, etc. all moving dynamic obstacles that you, as the player, must avoid. After you've completed your ""rite of passage"" you get to the boss.And now, the bosses, oh man, you're in for a kick (in the teeth). Much like the entire game, they are designed as geometrical figures, and their behavior is quite intelligent. It is very hard to take them down by just jumping or impacting on them, you need a specific, often non-obvious, strategy. Here the real fun begins, because it becomes a great challenge of trying to find the boss's soft spot, or its patterns, (even it's lack of), and by repeatedly playing the level discover what it's actual Achilles' heel is. After you defeat a boss you move on to the next area and from the on its rinse and repeat in a crazy, very fun, loop.This, of course, you can do on your own or by your loyal squires (aka friends) because it's got up to 4-player coop! So imagine trying to beat those whacky bosses with someone else.The game has been translated to every language on earth, I think only Esperanto and Elvish aren't there, and there are other gameplay modes you unlock that I won't spoil for you.Overall a very fun experience, highly recommended."

It is one of the most entertaining and addictive games I have played in a very loooooong time. If you are a player that enjoys a challenge and really tight controls, this game is a must have for you.I have only played the ""wave"" mode, it starts nice and quiet but it soon starts introducing more challenging enemies. From world 4 forwards the game is absolutely amazing but the best by far are the bosses. The last 3 are absolutely epic!The only thing I am missing is the possibility to choose my own colour, I hope the devs add this in the future because I dont like relying in stupid colour palettes!Overall, if you enjoyed Super Meat boy this is pretty much it, although I would say this is more intense because it gives you the chance to attack and smash the enemies."
,Recommended,508790,29432158,Posted: 22 January,all,franapic13,A great arcade game with polished mechanics and a lot of challenging levels. For sure one of the imprescindible games for when you invite a bunch of friends. I can't wait to see the next Big Update. Grate work guys!
76561198026498773,Recommended,508790,25705237,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,Omega,Great game for local co-op with friends.  The trailer does a good job of describing the game.  Fun moments of accidentally (or on purpose) killing each other and fun moment of over coming difficult challenges.  The difficulty ramps up appropriately.  All in all a great game.
,Recommended,508790,25929932,"Posted: 8 October, 2016",all,AlexWrench,"A stylish geometric platformer with clean vector graphics and a tactile feel. Single player can be played co-op, and unlocks a slew of multiplayer games. None of the multiplayer modes I've played was strong enough to carry the game on its own, but they offer plenty of variety and the main menu makes it easy and quick to jump into a new experiment.Flat Heroes joins Videoball and N++ as a simple, stylish action game that's great for parties and get-togethers."

Also the game teaches you elements in a mostly (sometimes not really) safe enviroment, one at a time. Only complaint I have was the difficulty curve was a little too steep, so if you rage easily, not the game for you. All in all, a good experience."

I havent attempted the speedruns or bought all the survival maps however. It is an amazing game aside from a glitch where in survival mode a rainbow thing covers the middle of the screen and one where if you select and deselect screen shake it will sometimes start to move off the screen, both of which dont affect gameplay. It also has plenty of replayability since it is a platformer and not a puzzle game, so there are plenty of different ways to do each level. Overall a fantastic game! :D"
