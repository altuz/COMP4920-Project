,Not Recommended,508960,25396313,"Posted: 7 September, 2016",all,Aro,"While I love puzzle games, particularly simplistic ones, I couldn't possibly recommendSizeBlock.The game is far too short, even for it's low asking price on the store page. I completed the entire game in less than 15 minutes, despite the buggy controls and mechanics on a handful of levels. I normally write extensive reviews for games, but there is quite literally nothing else to say here.Unless the developers add a boatload of extra content and fix the controls, I would advise spending your money elsewhere, I personally requested a refund for this title. There are much better puzzle games you can get on Steam for the same or even a lower price than this."

I played 11 minutes and spent $2 and beat the game. I enjoyed but even though it is quite cheap it is still too much for a 10 minute game."

I kept waiting for the actual puzzles to begin... then the game ended. The closest thing to a challange is guessing which of two options is correct, and which simply forces you to restart the level."
,Not Recommended,508960,25357434,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,INDIEKING,the controls are horrible its like trying to put a screw in with a fork. the block move speed is set to really fast and when you need to squeeze into tight spot its really really hard to stop where you need to. in most games like this and even on the **** atari if you held the direction you wanted to go before you got to that point you went in that direction not on this game and since the whole point of the game is moving a box to an exact coordinate this game fails for me.

,Not Recommended,508960,25404473,"Posted: 7 September, 2016",all,StaticCøde,"The best I can say about this is that I did enjoy the 15 minutes I spent in it, but that was all the time it took to complete all 36 levels. The levels themselves were very easy, and took at most 5-15 seconds per level. Non of them are that hard. The description is an out-right lie, with almost non of it actually being in the game. Not worth the $2 pricetag in my opinion."
,Not Recommended,508960,25384451,"Posted: 6 September, 2016",all,Mega,was fun but way to short finished all levels within 14 minutes and they weren't very challenging. would be much better if there were just more levels
,Not Recommended,508960,25405287,"Posted: 7 September, 2016",all,Pugs,I bought the game thinking it would be a fun puzzle game. It game me no challenge whatsoever and I beat the game in less than 15 minutes.
,Not Recommended,508960,32518851,Posted: 17 June,all,Megataco101,"got the game 90% off and it still wasnt worth the 20 cents. the game is literally a tutorial the entire 36 levels and you have to be younger than 10 to spend more than a single minute on a level. i dont understand how this got on steam, or how it took more than one human to make the game. now i have to idle the game to get the steam trading cards BECAUSE THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING LEFT IN THE ENTIRE GAME AFTER 10 MINUTES"
,Not Recommended,508960,31037248,Posted: 9 April,all,mmm!5NATCH,"This game is too easy and it's too simple to be entertaining.The music is nice, I'll give it that. However it's too easy and doesn't provide any challenge at allIf you can't handle the first ten levels.Then you probably should consider uninstalling steam and go outside to think about what you're doing with your life."

(and no i'm not going to pick on the grammer)ATG: Levels are represented as labyrinths with loads of traps, jigsaws and other challenges.Me: While yes the levels are, but bearly, labyrinths I have seen zero traps no ""jigsaws"" and it wasn't challenging is the slightest.ATG: The task is simple – just bring the cube to the final destination… However, that’s not that simple as it seems!Me: ""However, that’s not that simple as it seems!"" yes it is.ATG: Some of the obstacles can change, size, shape and even behavior of your cube!Me: yhea, sure but it really isn't that hard to look at the maze for 3 secons and see what you have to do.ATG: Ambient soundtrack will immerse you in relaxing environment of the game.Me: It wasn't making it immersive nor relaxing.all in allIt's not a good game for it's price 2 euros is a lot for a 10 minute game. If it were free, had more levels and was a little more challenging I would enjoy it alot but it isn't and i don't think it will change so use your money elsewhere becouse you can buy,1.680672269 tacos,8 bananas,0.05 ♥♥♥♥♥♥, (And, yes i googled how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cost.)0.105540897 jigsaw puzzlesand0.0002 baby Penguins"

Very boring, was hoping for much more from this game."

Graphics are okay for such a small game, music and sound too. Gameplay could be good, but:1. It's WAY too easy2. and glitchyI've played it with a controller (you still need the keyboard then) and was able to move through the walls with the blocks in levels where you have to controll two of them. This bug doesn't seem possible while playing with the keyboard, but it bothers me a little bit, that the blocks don't have to be on their goal. It's enough when they have at least touched it.So, is it worth the price or not? Well, if you want to have some fun for a few minutes and want to support a small team of developers, then why not. Would they add more levels with higher difficulties and maybe some more puzzles, fix the bugs, then it would be a good game."

But i paid like a dollar for it so i think it was worth the money. I hope they make a second one that is much harder because i really like the concept!"
,Recommended,508960,25358039,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,nerdtrash2k14,"This game was relaxing, simple, and quick to complete. I completed the game in 12 minutes, but I know I'll play it again if I'm feeling down (simple puzzles help me feel better). The music is serene and natural sounding with a calming simplicity, and despite there being only one track (as far as I know) it is a nice song. There are only 36 puzzles and I honestly wish there were many more, but for a couple bucks I'm only slightly dissapointed by the length. If you're looking for a puzzle game where you have to think a lot I'd recommend hexcells (or the Professor Layton series on the DS), but this is a more relaxing game with less brightness so it's more calming.Overall, I'd grab this game while it's on sale for 50% or more, unless you're alright with playing it once or plan on leaving it running to listen to the music."
