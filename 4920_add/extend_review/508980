,Recommended,508980,34150826,Posted: 10 August,all,[C3] Gamer Alex (AlexKVideos1),"Crashday: Redline Edition In-Depth ReviewMy BackstoryMy uncle got me this game called Crashday when I first started PC gaming back in 2013. I tried it out, and I hated it. For me, still being a console peasant, it was hard for me to pick up with the issues it had with controls, menu navigation, difficulty curve, etc. It sat on the self for years, until I found out the game I hated was being remastered. It got me thinking, so I bought the Redline Edition. Lets just say that have a 'different look' on the game now.Game ReviewCrashday: Redline Edition improves on the negative aspects of the original, while still keeping the same feel that set Crashday apart from the other generic car combat games.Optimization/PC SettingsI want to point out that even the original game had amazing settings. I was surprised that I could set the game to my 1080p 16:9 resolution at 144hz for a 11 year old game! The Redline Edition improves on every aspect. Not only that, it can run on a lot of computers, making it a great game for low end, mid range, and high end computers. However, the game still has noticable pop-in, and dated graphics, but this is made for PC. No ports here!Optimization/PC Settings: 9/10Modding""Download and play mods, cars, tracks and more from the newly integrated Steam Workshop, or create your own using the Crashday SDK. New: modded gameplay is now fully online-play compatible!""It speaks for itself.Modding: 10/10HUD & UIThey improved the HUD & UI so much. Not only did they fix the controller issues, it is much cleaner now. It also is now red, which makes sense compared to the baby blue of the original game, which really didn't set the mood well. Simple, clean, and clear cut HUD and UI.HUD & UI: 10/10Controls(I only used a controller) The controls are very easy to understand, and use. You don't have to be an expert to master the controls due to the easy arcade style controls.Controls: (For Controllers) 8/10CameraThe camera in the game is good, but lacks in a full 360 view. It only has a front, and back view which limits your field of view, especially from the side.Camera: 8/10AIThe AI is a mix of smart and dumb. A lot of times, the AI can be very hard to beat, but other times they screw up bigly, and give you the advantage. The racing AI is clueless, while the destruction AI is top notch. It is a mix bag of results which gives it a mixed bag rating.AI: 6/10DifficultlyThis game has a very difficult learning curve. It is easy to pick up the controls, but the AI is very aggressive, and doing stunt combos are so difficult, unless they are done just perfectly. The new pick-ups in the games, like the ammo, and repair vehicle help to lower the difficulty. The difficulty for this game makes sense, however, it is something you really need to get used to before you jump right into career mode, and online.Difficultly: 7/10GamemodesThe game features 6 gamemodes: Wrecking Match, Stunt Show, Hold The Flag, Race, Pass The Bomb, and Bomb Run. There is a Test Drive mode where you can drive around a map, but it has no real goal. Each mode has setting to adjust the gamemode to your liking. These modes are really fun, although they can get repetive over time. Their techinque of combining car combat, and stunting really pushed the game into a whole different style of car combat games than any other similar car combat games I played.Gamemodes: 8/10CareerCareer mode is very difficult, but in a frustrating way. I wanted to pull my hair out trying to complete career mode due to the relentless, instanity of the AI. You really need to practice, and practice in Single Events before you jump right in. Also, career has a plot, which really doesn't fit the game. They made this wacky game into a story that tries to make it intriguing, but really it isn't. Of course, you need to complete career mode to unlock vehicles, and upgrades, but with a frustratingly hard career mode, it just isn't fun at times.Career: 5/10MinigamesThe game features 6 minigames: Long Jump, Long Jump II, Vehicle Blast, Vehicle Blast II, Checkpoint Chase, and Checkpoint Chase II. These are fun minigames, but I would have liked more included than just the original ones. There are so many cool minigames made by the public for the original game, that hopefully can be put into the workshop, but the minigames supplied in the main game are fun, but more would be appreciated.Minigames: 7/10Online MultiplayerOnline is a total mess right now, not rating it until they fix the issues with crashes, hit registeration, and hosts.Online Multiplayer: n/aVehiclesThere are 12 vehicles, all from the original game. Each one is very unique, with so many different cars combined into one. I wish there were more, as they could have easily included more vehicles in the Redline Edition.Vehicles: 8/10CustomizationI find the car customization a bit weak. Many cars only have a few parts to choose from in each category. Some cars don't even have parts for certain categories! Also, not many performance upgrades are available to choose from. I am glad customization is there, but it needs to be developed on.Customization: 7/10Vehicle WeaponsThe vehicle weapons consist of single, and double missles, and a machine gun. There is not much to say other than the weapons have a lot of punch to them, and you just need to angle them perfectly to hit the target.Vehicle Weapons: 9/10Vehicle DamageThe vehicle damage is very dated. It was good back in 2006, but now it looks more like a spikey car.Vehicle Damage: 4/10PhysicsThe physics feel really good. Cars crash quite nicely, and doing barrels roles, and flips can be easly done. Nothing feels very unnatural.Physics: 8/10Track DesignThe track designs are really nice. Each map is very special, with the stunt maps being the real highligh of the tracks. This style of tracks is kinda weird, but fits perfectly with the tone of Crashday.Track Design: 10/10Track EditorThe track editor takes a while to master, but once you do, the track editor is a amazing tool. Even for more inexperienced player, you can easily make maps to share with everyone. Although it is not perfect, it is still an amazing tool that will help to extend the life of the game.Track Editor: 10/10SoundtrackOne of things I hated about Crashday was the soundtrack. They decided to bring back the original soundtrack, which makes a lot of sense, to keep the original game intact. I feel that the music still doesn't fit the atomsphere of the game well. The songs just don't get me in a ""let blow up♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; mood, which sours the gameplay. However, what I learned from my other indepth review is that I am going to have people yelling at me for giving the soundtrack a low score, especially people who grew up with this game, so I better not rate this category...Soundtrack: Please don't hurt me...Redline Edition: Is it worth it?Compared to the original release of Crashday, Redline Edition should be the one you pick up. Some issues still remain from the original Crashday v1.2, but all in all, the Redline Edition is a great upgrade from the original, which shows the company still cares about this game, something that companies just don't do anymore.Final Score: 7.8/10GreatA classic PC game, now has new life. Moonbyte decision to take a classic PC game, and rework it means old, and new players will have a lot more Crashdays to enjoy."

,Recommended,508980,34273322,Posted: 16 August,all,Tail,"Crashday: Redline Edition. 2006 legend back in steam. But is it good?My feelings about this game are really mixed. It surely is better than the original one, and it is a wonderful game, but there are so many things that feel not right.We'll go through the simple pros/cons schemePros:Physics are neat and car deforming model is actually really goodBig variety of gamemodes that play completely different from each otherPerfect amount of cars - not too big, but still has something to choose fromClass system. For example, player starts a race with cars being only Class C. You have to pick a weak, unmodified class C car or a modified class D car and so on, because perfomance mods affect classes.Decent car customization. Not really much, but still just enoughTile-based track editor that lets you build your dream track is simplistic yet efficentCar balance is not perfect, but goodGame can be quite challenging on certain maps and higher difficulitiesMultiplayer. Multiplayer is always goodPickups made this game more arcade and more fun.DON'T TOUCH THAT REPAIR YOU INCUBATING SON OF A BLEACHEnhanced mod support which lets you easily install mods through Steam Workshop™Soundtrack. It is very rad. Personally don't like the electronics, but the rock ones are just wonderful. Good ol' 0's rockStunt shows are just incredible.if you don't just hump on lots of dirt ramps aligned in a row of courseNostalgic feeling. Of course i couldn't not point on that, i grew up with this game.Cons:Almost everything related to steam is done very poorly and lazyTrading cards are just posters that we all saw thousands of times (you know, some artwork or concept art would be good)Badges are just wheels with different halosSmiles are useless, apart from flag smiles (which do not even work, but i guess it is steam's problem). In what case would you use dirt track smiles?Achievements are horrible and opposite of fun. Good achievements are the ones that arechallengingnotgrinding. Shooting 1m bullets is not fun. Would be better with achievements like ""Beat THE INCUBATOR with no deaths"" or ""Pass Mansfield autocade in 3 minutes""or something like that.Nobodyloves grinding.EDIT: The most grinding achievements were removed, it is good, but game still lacks a good ones. We'll see about it.Mod supportisbetter, but reloading assets through game restart sucks. I know that it's engine restriction, but while you are restarting the game, server might've already started the race. And then you go and disable mods to join normal servers and for that you have to restart the game again. justmehUsual bugs. The game may not be as crashy as before, but you will still CTD sometimes.In old crashday, there was an ability to add your own music. Convert to ogg, drop into folder, done. Now you can't do that, everything is packed. It offers you steam music feature, but it just does not work as agame soundtrack. You don't see music switching on race start, career music is overlapped, it is literally disabling game music and enabling music on the background. Crashday soundtrack is good, but there's just not too many songs there. Why can't i add music through mods? Well, that's the next problem:No client-side mods. You wanna change your HUD and put custom music? Yeah, sure, you can do that, but forget about multiplayer, because these areserver-side mods, which means that they are treated like any other ones. And if you host a game, all people on your server will acknowledge your taste in music and your hatsune miku on speedometer.Graphics were improved, but in some places textures are still blurryTo get a colored nickname, you have to change your steam nickname. A lot of games support in-game nickname changing, why Crashday fails at this?Overall, the game is really, really good even with all the problems and every flatout/carmaggedon fan should check it out."

New things in Crashday Redline Edition are:-better HUD-slightly better graphics-steam-side master server-and even Steam Workshop supportI am super glad that they kept in the soundtrack and the track editor. It was the things I loved most about this game. Hopefully this newer and improved Crashday brings back the people who have fond memories of the original game and newer people who have never heard of it. Pure nostalga for me!

This is Crashday"

,Recommended,508980,34151082,Posted: 10 August,all,Wasowsk1,"My first thoughts on this game are great.Pros:- Some really fun game modes, (really enjoying hold the flag bomb run the most)- Career is simple but fun and is really good at getting you use to the game mechanics and the different modes.- The game runs well on max settings, even the worst of computers could probably get a solid 60 on max settings.Cons:- The track editor is really glitchy, just trying to make a simple race and random holes spawn everywhere and I can fall through the floor- When previewing certain visual upgrades to your car, they do not always load, which is a pretty annoying inconvenience.Conclusion:A great game with lots of promise, Iron out a few minor bugs and it becomes a fantastic game for less than £10"

The game feels the same, it is fun alot of fun,  it is an unique game that i don't get tired of! The improved graphics are a good bonus, they are perfectly good for the game and i love the idea of adding workshop support, the multiplayer is a good place to hang with friends but honestly i don't think the game will do well in public rooms (only time will tell) but if you have friends who play, it will be  fun for sure. The game's price IMO is fair and i think it is good as more people can afford it and will be possibly playing online and able to enjoy this game!Thanks for bringing this masterpiece back to life!"

Seriously, did u see this achivevement, smth bout ""play the game for 1000 hrs""? With this editor, u'll get it in no time, coz it's so much fun to make your own tracks, that u can literally spend days on it. And when u launch the game, launcher says smth bout ""mods"".

This game was my childhood, I used to spend countless hours playing, modding, creating tracks, hacking the track editor with Cheat Engine to make those insane maps like the 1 billion points map or whatever, messing with the game's dds files to create huge missiles, increase deformation levels, even participated in a small competitive community. But then... the masterserver was closed and my favorite game died. Even though some new masterservers were born thanks to die hard fans, it eventually got empty. Until today.Seeing it in my Steam suggestions made me cry real tears of joy, and reading that it now has a Steam masterserver made me buy it in a heartbeat, all while crying and shaking and screaming.PROS:- It's stupidly fun- Cars with missiles and miniguns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- Cars that fly around!!!!!!!!- Soundtrack- Deformation models that look better than many modern games- Seven game modes, each of which with customizable options that bring the actual number of game modes to a two number figure.- It can run on a trash can- High resolutions and refresh rates support- Track editor- Car tuningCONS:- Even though it runs at hundreds of frames, it feels stuttery. Issue persists even with vsync and fast sync- Old bugs are still there (missiles going through cars, wheels disappearing under the ground upon landing from hundreds of meters, sport suspensions making your car spin around after landing, albeit it probably is a wanted feature)- Even though it supports mods, it's a shame that there is no: Jane's mod, Heightmap hack, ability to mess with game's files to change deformation levels, damage levels, car's performance, missile's force etc...If you were a die hard fan of this game, you will not be disappointed, it's been revived from the dead, as cool as it was 10 years ago. I will make sure to bring together everyone that enjoyed this game back then, so we can recreate everything that made this game special. Buy it, the developers deserve it, the credits in the original game always brought a tear to my eyes :)Later Edit: developers are actually helping brining it back completely, they posted a way to enable >100% slopes, great!!!!!"
76561198258445335,Recommended,508980,34360180,Posted: 19 August,all,Samppu,"Ah, this game. Played it a few years after it was released, liked it, good fun. Finally this treatment, Steamworks for the game. What I like:- Nice looking cars, clearly all of them have various cues from real life cars. One of the more interesting designs is the Bornbad GT90, rear is Corvette C6 and front looks like a Ferrari.- Car variety. Supercars, slower but more destructive and durable ones like a Hummer and a pickup truck, then a few hatchbacks and some muscle cars.- Improved handling physics. The original felt just a bit simplistic. Now, the Bornbad, Firestarter, Apachee and Ironhorze all are quite challenging to keep in control at exiting a corner. But when you do learn to drive those, it becomes fun to skillfully drift at exiting corners.- Improved graphics. Could use some realtime shadows & reflections, bump mapping and whatnot but I'm fine with how it looks.- Steamworks. This means official mod support and multiplayer master server by Steam.- Solid fun simply. In derby, either crush, smash and pummel the opposition with your car itself or go for ranged combat with a minigun and missiles. Then, there is good old standard racing. And some other nice game modes.- Sound design really is quite nice for a 2006 indie game. All engine sounds are in least good and several are great. The interior cam sound also is nice. Engine sound, transmission latching, gear whining and backfires all sound different in inside view and sound great while we're at it. Especially the backfire blasts and sounds of gearshifting. The roar of missiles is awesome too.However this game is still cult stuff, a broken gem. What isn't so well off:- Stunt events are meh.- Car to car collision is odd. Just feels rubbery, compared to flatout 1 or 2. Can't seemingly really do things like T-boning.- In crashy smashy action, there is a way overboard emphasis on sound of glass breaking. When the smallest glass part like headlight lens shatters, there is this bombastic glass smash sound. It plays way too much in demolition action. Kinda ruins the wrecking fun. The sound either should be more subtle or simply less volume for it.- Damage model is kinda dated. In default cars atleast, hoods can't come off..but the damaged textures do look pretty nice and deformation looks satisfactory.- Clipping problems. Several times I've dropped into the void beneath ground, due to the road tiles being bad. And when landing a jump nose-first, your car's nose will clip into the ground, slowing you arbitrarily.- No clientside mods. I'd like to replace the glass shatter sound with something less extreme and have custom textures, HUD etc..- Minigun sound leaves a lot to be desired. Should be a mechanical roar.- Car amount is quite limited. Variety of car types is good but there are rather few cars.- Minimap doesn't show roads. Sigh.In conclusion, at the time I wrote this review, still a bit unpolished and rough game but nevertheless I've had a blast."

,Recommended,508980,34178557,Posted: 11 August,all,Tim McIlrath,"Okay, so this is something really special for me.Crashday has always been one of the games from my childhood that have constantly had a place on my harddrive throughout all the years and I played it at leats once a year, even if it was only to install some mods. I had tons of fantastic hours of gameplay in this game and when I found out that it's going to be remastered, I nearly choked. I never expected this but I love the fact that it happened!About the game itself: Crashday is a game in which you race cars, fight with cars and do stunts with cars. Those are equipped with a minigun and a rocket launcher (not usable in every mode/event). The vanilla game features 12 cars, all of which have their own special capabilities, and a whole bunch of tracks/scenarios which are playable in seven game modes.There'sWrecking Matches, which is basically the Vehicle deathmatch in which you fight other drivers and earn points for kills/wrecks. This can be played in an FFA variant of in teams.Then there'sDeath Matches, which is pretty much the same except for the fact that each player or team has to be first to reach a specific amount of kills.Last Man Standingshould be quite self-explanatory, you fight other drivers to complete destruction, and the last car to stand wins.There's alsoStunt Showsin which the player has to show tricks with his vehicle, e.g. jumps, barrel rolls, flips and general destruction. The aim of this mode is to collect as many point through combos in a given time.Racesshould not need to be explained, they work the same as in every other racing game (except for the gunplay, maybe).Hold the Flagis a classic mods in which a player or a team has to capture a flag and keep it while driving through a set amount of checkpoints. The first team to clear enough checkpoints wins and the flag can be taken away from another car by ramming it.Pass the Bombis a mode played in Death Match arenas where one player gets a bomb fixed to his car at the start of each round which has a timer that runs out before it explodes. The bomb gets passed on to other cars by ramming them. Whoever had the bomb last gets the most points each round, and the one who blows up gets nothing.Bomb Runsare a kind of races in which every participant gets a bomb fixed to his car which will only go off if the car's speed decreases below a certain point. The minimum required speed raises with each passed checkpoint of the race.At last, there'sTest Drives, which simply let you roam around the maps on your own without any goal.Another unique feature about this game is its detailed track editor, which lets the player choose from a huge variety of environmental tiles and objects (expandable through the Steam workshop) and build a track, arena or scenario of their own. It's easy to use and gives a lot of room for creativity.The career mode is quite short, which I find to be a little sad as the game has potential to hold a much bigger number events, but what's there is good, and should be challenging enough for most players.The multiplayer mode offers everything that the single player mode offers aswell, except for the Test Drive mode, but as far as I've been experiencing it, it's great fun, aswell with friends as in public lobbies.In my opinion, Crashday is an underrated game with a lot of potential for modding and building and every fan of Racing games should give it a try, especially if they love a good bit of destruction with it."

As many of you might know, Crashday wasn't exactly game of the year back in it's day. It showed a lot of potential but it had even more problems, unfortunately Moonbyte hasn't fixed most of them...Things they did fix:+ The speed bug, you can't reverse into the world border to go faster than the speed of sound anymore.+ Random crashes to desktop while racing, most of them.+ Multiplayer netcode.Things they added on top:+ You can now change the exhaust flame color. Yay.+ New and improved (I guess?) interface.+ Powerups in Wrecking Matches.Problems they didn't fix:-The missile mechanics. Missiles still randomly go through enemies or bounce off them, it actually seems to be more common now, probably due to the higher framerate. Speaking of which...-The game has no built-in framerate limiter, not even in the form of V-Sync. For me it runs at 180 FPS on average unless I force V-Sync from the GPU control panel.Soon to be fixed.- The vehicle physics. Your car will still fall through the ground if you try to land on a ramp, a small hill. or other similar formations. It's not common, but it's common enough to be annoying.- The auto-recovery. When you fire a missile at an enemy you better pray to god that it doesn't flip them over, otherwise there's a 90% chance they'll re-spawn right behind you. Especially problematic in the final mission.- Random crashes in the customization menu.- Random crashes in the map editor.Problems they added:- They increased difficulty the Payday 2 way, by turning AI drivers into bullet sponges able to defy the laws of physics. This in itself wouldn't be such a bad thing if it weren't for the problems I mentioned above. The final mission in particular is excruciating as it embodies pretty much everything that's wrong with Crashday.- Framerate drops in multiplayer.So unless you're buying it for the nostalgia factor, or you really like colored NOS, I can't really recommend this..."

In fact, it's faster to drive backwards now, because you accelerate not only faster, but can achieve any speed in reverse gear. You're winner!Same soundtracks. Which is kinda cool, but they could've added at least something.What did we get? ""Improved"" graphics that still look like they are straight from 2006. 10 brand new tracks (WHY?). This is pretty much the old Crashday with what is supposed to be new features, but they either don't work or implemented badly. In fact, I managed to hit an invisible wall and go through a container while testing physics.If you own original Crashday - well, better just play it and don't care.

The ""new"" game is not exactly new, but it's a good enough upgrade to make you buy it. Even if you didn't play the original, it's worth a try at least, 11,99€ might be a little too much, but as soon as it goes under 10€, it's a good pick up in my opinion.

,Recommended,508980,34150952,Posted: 10 August,all,Thunder X,"I've been a longtime fan of the game since its original launch in 2006. When I heard that Crashday was getting a re-launch with improvements, enhancements, and Steam Workshop support, I knew I had to get this game.Crashday: Redline Edition provides EVERYTHING that fans of the original have come to expect. There have been no un-necessary changes, meaning that longtime fans will be able to pick this up and start playing online or in the game's single player right away. The improved gamepad support is greatly appreciated, and whilst it does take a bit of time to memorize the buttons, a bit of playing will definitely help this out.The gameplay is addicting and rewarding. Being able to demolish your opponents or friends online and at times even escape with the victory is always a great feeling. Thanks to the addition of powerups, it can keep matches going for longer and adding more depth to the matches. The car handling is exactly as it was 11 years ago, so its easy for me to get back into the hang of things, but newcomers might need to take a bit of time to master it down. Once you've got it down however, its solid and responsive.The graphics are largely the same from the original release, however there are some enhancements made to keep the game from looking as if its aged poorly. For a small game like this, it still looks rather good considering its original time of release.The online at the time of this review isn't exactly the smoothest. Sometimes races may fail to start, but when they do it seems to be pretty consistent. Lag is dependant on the person's connection, but if you are racing with others who have good connection, you shouldn't have many issues.The music is the same as original. Which is nice.Thanks to Steam Workshop support and the built-in track editor, this game provides plenty in terms of replay value, allowing you to mod and create to your heart's desire. Kudos points to Moonbyte for providing a Mod Manager at startup, so you can set it to your liking. Reminds me of the old fan-made mod managers from Need for Speed: High Stakes. OH, and you can use mods online! Take-Two should take some lessons there..If you've never had the chance to play this game before, DEFINITELY consider getting this Steam release. Its 100% faithful to the original and has several bug fixes, optimizations, enhancements, and many more to make this the definitive release of the game. For longtime fans like myself, I am going to enjoy the many hours I spend in this game.I highly recommend this game."

For the lovers of destructive racing, it's a must!"

This game is one of the games that defined my childhood. It was really fun back in the day, and it's still fun to this day. A classic back in 2006, now finally on Steam.I don't notice anything being removed, even the OSTs I remember are still there! Even MP is still there, utilizing Steam's servers, and even modding is still here and made easier with Workshop support. An excellent Steam port that other rereleases should follow. Thanks for enhancing my childhood!But I should point out what didn't age well, at least from my perspective:- Graphics, obviously. Still looks pretty good in my opinion!- Career mode. It's really short, but I remember this game being a budget release, so there's not a lot of content to begin with. Besides, there's mods!- Physics. They're pretty hard to grasp into, even after 11 years. I've played better controlling car combat games before this.But even after that, it still gets a solid 8/10 from me. Especially for only almost-10 bucks. Besides, we have mod support!Go get it, today is Crashday!"

Nothing seems broken or made worse that the original, plus the Redline Edition adds some new maps and reworked graphics, as well as some new additions (mainly powerups). One thing that seems kind of different is the combo mechanism. It seems it doesn't work properly every time. The game gets a big thumbs up for a working Multiplayer mode. Unfortunately, it's still a little bit buggy, but I hope all the bugs are going to be patched soon. For me as an owner since its premiere, It is an obligatory purchase. As it is on Steam now, it offers Steam Workshop support which gives us a simple way of installing mods or sharing our tracks. I really recommend purchasing this game, for older gamers, as well as younger players, who don't mind the outdated 2006 graphics.PL: Nawet po przerobieniu, gra została utrzymana w swoim starym stylu, nic nie jest popsute, może poza systemem combo który wydaje się nie zawsze ""łapać"". Dodatkowo Edycja Redline dodaje kilka nowych map, przerobioną grafikę i kilka innych dodatków (głównie powerupy). Gra dostaje wielkiego plusa za działający tryb Multiplayer, nie oparty na niedziałającym już GameSpy, oraz za wsparcie Steam Workshopu który ułatwia nam instalację modów oraz dzielenie się swoimi trasami z innymi. Niestety tryb wieloosobowy ma w sobie kilka błędów, które mam nadzieję, zostaną szybko naprawione. Dla mnie jako posiadacza wersji pudełkowej gry prawie od premiery, obowiązkowy zakup. Polecam kupno Crashdaya starszym graczom (głównie posiadaczy zwykłej wersji) jak i młodszym, którym nie przeszkadza oczywiście grafika z roku 2006."

Did not have as much fun with this as I would have 10-15 years ago."

Sure, maybe you won't be able to play online, but at least the career mode is free of powerups and you don't have to deal with the Russian cancer on the online mode.I'm very, very disappointed."
