,Recommended,508990,24924004,"Posted: 14 August, 2016",all,Ryan Dorkoski,"I mean,Handsome Mr. Frogisn't some great gem, but what it sets out to do, it does quite well - and it's only a buck.The worst part about the game is how simple and one-dimensional the gameplay is.Essentially, you use your tongue to catch enemies and knock throw them around to kill them in a couple of ways.Other than jump, it's your only other action. The whole level is seen on a single screen. While there is a theme with animals, the artistic cohesion is debatably wonky.Pros:+Fairly tight controls+The artwork is crisp, albeit fairly 'meh' when it comes to pixel art+It is cheapCons:-Overly simple, and in a bad way - this results to it not really being that addicting to be honest-You get wayyy too many lives IMO, which means games go on for entirely too long-Some level design is questionable because several times there was a safe area where I could just spam attack and I would never get it; it amounted to reduced fun, to be sure-The hit-box to catch things with your tongue is too large, allowing you to pull off some wacky catches that look more like a glitch than a clever trickI almost gave it a negative review, but the price-point made me switch.Just understand that the game is really simple, so don't expect meta-game progression, items, leveling up, story, unlocks, or really anything other than the two actions you get.Peace,"
,Recommended,508990,33237778,Posted: 4 July,all,KenOD,"If what you want is a straight forward high-score game that would have fit in well in 1980s arcades, this does the job just like Mario Bros or Bubble Bobble used to do. I'm enjoying myself with it as a quick game to play for a few minutes here and there.Fair warning, if you are going to play this game on Windows 10 you may get a black screen only. If that occurs, set it to run compatability to Windows 8.To do so just find the game. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Handsome Mr. Frog if you let Steam set up default downloads.Right click -> Properties. Once the menu pops up click on the compatability tab, click the box under Compatibility mode that reads ""Run this program in compatibility mode for"" and select Windows 8."
,Recommended,508990,24787617,"Posted: 8 August, 2016",all,Colin,"This is a really cute, and nice game, reminiscent of arcade games from years before, or, at least it channels that sort of charm--it's fairly fun, but, a few nitpicks have kept it from being very fun, and more along the lines of frustrating, at least to me. For one, when you jump, and move backwards of the direction you're currently facing, Mr. Frog keeps facing the same direction; so if you jump, and try to turn around to fire something at an enemy right behind you, you're going to fire in the other direction, leaving you quite vulnerable to being hit, ergo, losing one of ten lives you start with. Second, there isn't a pause feature of any kind, so if you need a break at some point, you aren't going to be able to get one until all waves of enemies are cleared, giving you a little breather. Overall, it's a charming, and adorable game, but these two issues are quite off-putting to me, since I'm used to fluid reactions in my video games. Mr. Frog feels as though he's slippery in mid-air, and doesn't react very quickly."

,Recommended,508990,24922783,"Posted: 14 August, 2016",all,zooboo,"Handsome Mr. Frogis the latest in a long line of addictive arcade games.The game is best described as a platforming arcade score chaser. Its developer, Cowboy Color, was the team behindChargeShot, so it's no surprise that this game looks and plays so well. The premise of the game is that you are the titular handsome frog whose hat has been stolen by thieving animals, and you go on a vengeful rampage. It's pretty great.The gameplay is simple but fluid. You can grab onto enemies or blocks with your long tongue and then launch them into others to knock them out. The game spans across 4 different worlds with 3 levels each, drawing from a pool of randomized room designs. Each world has 2 types of different enemies with separate behaviors, giving you a new challenge to adapt to as you progress. Along the way, you can pick up items in bubbles to increase your score, spit fireballs, or even unlock cute hats! Getting hit once will knock you out, but you start with 10 lives that can be replenished through pickups, so the game feels forgiving. All of this helps the game feel fast and fun.The look of the game clearly draws from a retro aesthetic, but it's so charming that it stands apart from other indie games that use the gimmick. Most importantly, all of the art is clear and easy to read. You can always find yourself on the screen, and all of the enemies and items are easy to spot. The sound design is also hilarious. Mr. Frog always sounds like a robot with a sore throat when he talks. On death, I swear he sounds like he's saying ""Donald Trump"". I'm not kidding. Plus, you're playing along to sweet, catchy tunes. It sounds like you're playing on an old arcade machine; it's such a greatsoundtrack.All in all, I love this game. The controls feel tight and responsive, and it's easy to pick up and learn. Others might feel like it's too simple, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's a great game to pick up and play, and it's easily addictive enough to keep you entertained for as long as you want to be. Besides, anybody who'd give a negative review to this game is probably a killjoy, anyway. The game is well worth its $0.99 asking price, and I definitely got what I wanted out of it. #worthitTL; DRFor fans ofSuper Crate Box,Downwell, andWoah Dave!"

Seriosuly this a very good simple game that almost anyone can just pick up and play any time anywhere and have a boatload of fun. If a mash up of Arcade Mario and Kirby sounds appealing to you this is a must play. If you just like fun little indie games this is also a must play. For an in depth review and plenty of gameplay check out my video review. I had a lot of fun making it and I hope it's informative to the steam community.

,Recommended,508990,28891508,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,I'm Tiny Rick!!!,A solid .99 cent game.  An old school arcade experience for the price of an old school arcade credit.  Somewhat Bubble Bobble like in both presentation and gameplay.
,Recommended,508990,24812536,"Posted: 10 August, 2016",all,Petery Boy,"A cute little game, this one. Has that nice retro feel, and is simple enough to pick up or put down whenever you have free time. Props to the devs for the frog literally croaking when he dies. And the ribbit sounds, oh my!One of very few games on the quirker side that does not go too overboard with quirk. He's just a handsome frog makin' his way through some doors. Nothing too in your face, no intense visual or audible noise. All in all the game is just a pleasant experience. Good for cooling off. While I, personally, would prefer if there were some way to take 2 hits before you lose a life, the 10 lives you're given from the start are actually very forgiving (especially of course if you're just playing to cool off. I've yet to get past the second area so I really can't talk about the grand scheme of things here.)The game of course, has its flaws. Aerial movement feels quite odd, though I suppose it acts the way it does as tribute to older games which made you really commit to jumps more (so if you're into that kind of thing, its really a plus!), where as now'a'days most people in video games have the aerial movement of some kind of helicopter jetplane hybrid.  A lot of the time the aerial movement just kills the experience for me, literally and figuratively. I think its the combination of low aerial mobility and the fact that using your only means of attack freezes you in mid-air. Leaves you open for quite a while. Perhaps I'm just taking too ballsy an approach to the game though, and it isn't quite as fast paced as I'm trying to make it.This by no means though completely ruins the game, it is merely frustrating. For the low price of just under a dollar, it is (I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not) literally a crime not to try this game out."

Got the game because I like old-school arcade titles.Either way--this game is a surprising fun romp with elements similar to Mario Bros., Snow Bros., and Bubble Bobble. At some points it can get challenging, but that doesn't fully occur until the third and fourth world change. It's difficulty is balanced enough to where I think somebody with enough experience with platformers could have an engaging experience, but simple enough to where it's not too demanding, and feels classic. It's a great neo-arcade title, that's a great deal for the mere asking price of a buck.If you're interested, another good neo-arcade title that nobody knows about is, Gon' E-Choo (that one plays like Popeye, 1982).If I didn't feel morally wrong giving this a proper review (since I know the composer), I'd easily give it a score over or around an 8... though... I suppose recommending it counts as a review, so my credibilty is gone... It's a fun pick up and play, nevertheless."

Because the controlls aren't fluid and the levels are designed poorly the optimum strategy is to sit in one place and spam the ""x"" button. Also, Super Mario was good because you had to voluntarily be in harm's way in order to hit the enemies, whereas this game allows you to stay completely safe while killing things."
