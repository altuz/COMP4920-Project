,Recommended,509110,25517382,"Posted: 15 September, 2016",all,ErickaUnlimited,"OverviewSpikit is described as a bullet hell game where the player must dodge a constant bombardment of spikes and obstacles in an ever-changing 2D landscape. Spikit is a tricky game to classify; while it doesn’t fulfill the traditional bullet hell criteria, it’s not much of a rhythm game either, as the obstacles do not fully interact with the beat of the music. With that being said, Spikit is a fairly primitive form of the genre with only one beat sequence throughout the game and  no method(s) of introducing your own [music] to the mix.You start the game with one life and a small box as your environment. The music begins and spikes [hence the name] began shooting out from various sides of your screen. Being struck by any one object will cause your score to reset to “0” and automatically starting you out at the beginning again.During the course of the game, smaller square blocks will randomly appear, which can be collected and used to purchase minor cosmetic changes such as changing your square’s “face” or the color scheme of your of the overall game screen. There’s not much use to them other than personal appeal, though I did find the dark purple color to be easier on the eyes and kept obstacles from bleeding together after longer playing sessions.There is no end game to Spikit, nor does it really create any purpose aside from besting your own personal skill or the global leaderboard for those that are interested. Due to the game’s overall lack of popularity, it’s not entirely difficult to crest the top of the leaderboards with a bit of practice. At the time of this writing, I was within the top 30 players; a feat that sounds more impressive that it really is though. Those looking for a challenge might find it momentarily engrossing, but there’s not enough substance to keep you hooked.ProsEasy to pick up and play in short burstsFor achievement hunters, Spikit offers a fairly easy game to complete.It’s cheap(?)ConsVery little purpose aside from testing your own skills.The music can become annoying over time –especially if you die frequently, forcing it to reset.Shallow customization options.Lackluster substance overall.Overall, Spikit could have been much more than what it turned out to be. It’s a saturated market that requires innovation in order to stand out, but Spikit doesn’t quite deliver anything new or interesting. While I can’t give a negative review for Spikit, it doesn’t deserve a positive one either; Spikit sits comfortably in the middle of mediocrity."

Not as proclaimed a bullet hell. Because spikes only come from 4 sides but not like in a real bullethell from each possible angle. So dodge your way up and you'll see that suddenly the screen begins to shake. Not the best if you already suffer from food poisoning or you are intoxicated right atm. But still far away from epileptic stroke. There's even a laserpointed missile at score 600 but nvm. Only good is to collect some of the blinking blocks which look like extra lives but they aren't. This is a one life game! So it's just a currency to pay you different colors of the playfield called ""skins"" or diferent characters which are simple smileys. Game is ok and  a little fun for a hour. But no longer. Because of throwup reasons ..."
,Recommended,509110,30501263,Posted: 13 March,all,KrimsonX,"I Have played Rhytmic game like Geometry Dash Guitar Hero Rhythm Track etc. Never have i found a game so quick and delightful and overall fun, the fundementals are very basic but as you go along gets very complex. I Was leveling up my ccount when i got a 90% coupon and i saw this game and it caught my eye so i decided to buy it and boy... it was worth those 10 cents but if you buy it without a coupon still its very worth it. Theres so many positive sides about this game and very few negatives, First of the mechanics are amazing the basic spikes come out of walls and you try to dodge them fun exciting gets the adreline pumping and overall enjoyable. Another positive thign i would like to address is the community although the community is small everyones still very nice and open. Although i have 1 big problem though the spikes are scripted so you can almsot memorize where there coming from ive realized there are 5 different ways the spikes can come out of along with when you reach 75 points it becoems mroe intense which isnt bad except when your screen is being shaken, That is my only negative *part* i think of about spikit but overall great game i hope you all enjoy this fanastic game! Peace and keep playing9 1/2 out of 10"

,Recommended,509110,25662649,"Posted: 23 September, 2016",all,foxyshadis,"This is a dirt simple reflex arcade game -- watch the arrows, GTFO, repeat. In short order bigger badder arrows pop up, the screen shakes, and everything goes to hell. It's cheap simple mindless reflex action, it's mildly addicting, and to some people that is FUN. Once you get a bit of rhythm in it, you can go far. You've seen everything it has to show you in the first ten seconds, and that's just fine.There are some serious polish problems -- like the fact that once it goes to hell you can't actually SEE what the next wave will be, or that once in a while you get hit with an undodgable combo, both of which should have been fixed before release -- but despite that, you can get lucky and quick and hit some achievements before you scream bloody murder at the TV, and isn't that all there is to live?If you're splitting hairs over whether it's worth a buck or 50 cents or just 10 cents, just stop, your time is worth more than that. Either you'll like it enough to pay a pittance or you won't.PS: Use Joy2Key if you want gamepad support."

At first I thought that even if it is just junk, i might as well try it for that price.As it turns out, this game isactually pretty good. It' very easy to pick up and doesn't need any explaining; sh*t's coming at you, you need to avoid it. Yes, the whole thing might be a copy of a copy of a copy of an somewhat unique game and is therefore nothing new, but it's pretty good at that. The game is flashy, while not being annoying and has a prettygood soundtrackthat might be a bit repetative at first but keeps unfolding while playing.It might seem impossible for some at first, but after playing it for a bit you get a hang of it and it actually feels pretty ""rewarding"" to finally break that previous top score without actually giving you something in exchange. Im still amazed about the fact that 3,5% of the players passed the 1000 poits mark but it of course shouldn't be too easy master.In conclusion, Spikit is a fun little game, with anice soundtrack, pretty ""adictive"" gameplay and in my opiniondefenitely worth its 10c, or even 99c when bought without a discount.Update:It's neraly midnight and I had to force myself to stop playing this game after passing the 500 points mark... as I said, it's kinda addictive.Also, I got 3 card, all worth 8-10 cents and therefore got the money back I spent.8/10"

Although this game is fun it flaws in a level developmet as all spikes that appear are randomised wich can make some senarios impossable to overcome.

Oh yeah, and it gets kinda shaky.The entire game in general is great, however, there's a complaint I must add (which probably just involves being bad at the game,) :- It's slightly clear they use in-set designs for spikes, however, the timing can screw you over. For example, you can be cornered, and have one literal half-a-second to get to the other end of the ""map"" before getting killed.Would reccomend to a friend, 10/10 - THIG(H)N"
