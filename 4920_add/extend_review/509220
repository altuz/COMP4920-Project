,Recommended,509220,32258462,Posted: 7 June,all,homertino,Save Jesus is a fun point-and-click puzzle game. The stages are played with true physics where you manipulate a rolling ball to wipe out enemies and leave Jesus unharmed. The format is similar to Angry Birds with levels that can be completed and then attempted again to receive the maximum 3 stars. The game is the perfect length for a casual gamer but may be too repetitive for players looking for 10+ hours of gameplay. The presentation is clean with sharp cartoon visuals alongside very funny voice over jokes thrown in occasionally. I found the main villain to be extremely funny in his laid back evilness !  I was quoting all of his sayings after finishing the game. I would love to see that character return in a sequel or another game. Perhaps where you play as him in the time machine and have to kill historical figures from different periods.

The whole game is like that: you need to time your drops to movement in the level, time explosions just right, and repeat the level over and over until you get it right if you didn't. (And then repeat some more if you want to 100% it, because you have to beat each level with each of the 7 types of balls that seem to play exactly the same.) Other than that, it's not difficult, 3 stars per level notwithstanding: on many levels, you can't even complete it with less. I don't understand how a simple game like this can hog over 600 MB of disk space.It's not my idea of fun.The game does run windowed, and it also runs fine on older systems."

The puzzles are getting harder and timing becomes more important as you progress through the 50 levels this game has to offer. A little downside is the fact that you'll need some (or a lot) of faith in some later levels because there are very luck based situations.Save Jesus will take you about two hours to finish with all stars, which is a fair amount of gameplay for 1,60€ in my opinion. It's better than the coke you'd get for that money and no coke get's you to hell this fast.You can put more time in it to get all the achievements, but they basically force you to beat every level seven times.8/10 awaiting Muhammad DLC"

My bae left me and my family called me a disappointment right before they died and was revived by jesus after I beat this game.    Praise the lord and share the holyness of this game.

I want to see a sequel with a slightly better budget, a few more features, and a HUD that looks a little more original.

,Recommended,509220,34285925,Posted: 16 August,all,Jack Sparrow,"I highly recommend this game because there are lots of games with the same price with less fun and less time to end. So this one has 60 levels and if you want to get 3 stars on each level its not easy as you think. When you have free time like waiting for something or speaking with your friends, this game is what you need. It also needs your intelligence. This is not a long term game for sure so just think like a puzzle game which takes max 3 hours to get all the levels done. Well story ends after level 50. But there is kinda stunt levels between 50 and 60 and those are really fun but I can also say that it is really hard I destroyed my brain cells until I finished that thing all 60 levels. When game ends you ll be really relaxed and unstressed but while playing it you ll be really stressed because it drives you CRAZY. I didnt look any walkthrough and finished the game so you can do as well. Nice game.My Rating is  8.50 / 10.00"

IDK if I would have paid more for it, but .50 is the right price.  I was able to pretty much 100% the whole thing in 5 hours.  There are a couple things that annoyed me while playing 1)'ball' would get stuck or stop and it would take upwards of 20 seconds for it to respawn 2)not having the ability to choose the ball you want.  Those are minor problems I ran into, but I also enjoyed the simplistic puzzle solving throughout the game.  He has a time machine, dumby.  Would recommend if your looking for a quick fun puzzle game.  Enjoy!PS: Game was fun Mr game developer.  Thank you!  Good Luck in your future games!"
,Recommended,509220,26283236,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,Or not 2B,"Save Jesus is a casual puzzle game with a single basic focus for each level: Save Jesus (and at times, his friends) from being killed by traps set by Romans and other antagonists, and use the traps against the Romans themselves and later time traveling imposters who threaten Jesus.Typical levels are won by eliminating every Roman soldier from the map using boulders, and require an increasing amount of timing, effort, and strategy by the player to beat each level.Each level has three stars for the player to collect, that, while the player can ignore and beat the game regardless of them, a completionist will be given pleanty of encouragement to pursue the goal of getting each star in the game, and for that reason, levels' difficulties will increase should the player want to collect all of the stars in the game, which increases the entertainment value as a whole.On a technical level, the game has excellent audio assets and visual elements that fit the theme and context and concept of the game perfectly, and its usage of voice acting is just as great, with voice lines only being used in certaint stages o the game, each instance being accurate and not coming off as being awkward, poorly recorded, or out of place.The game in general is a fun, inexpensive, and an all-around great title. It's on sale as of my writing of this review for a dollar but is regularly only twice this. I highly suggest that you buy this game, it's a perfect blend of difficulty and fun, and it's an outstanding example of a casual title that you can lose a few hours in saving Jesus from the Romans and Time Travelers."

The graphics and physics in this game are scary realistic. It gets down to the point where a ball rolling down a hill will turn suddenly and fall off of a cliff. Now, the graphics are very intense so it only runs at 2+ fps if you have 12 Titan X's and a 15 GHz processor. However, once you get the game running at a nice, solid 1 fps (my recommendation is turning the graphics down to fastest until you meet the specifications above), you're set for good times to come for decades if not centuries. 11/10"

There usually isn't an ""aha"" moment when solving things, but rather a series of trial and error.  This complaint is diminished a bit because the level at least isn't expecting a perfect solution (it uses the three-star-system for this), but it doesn't hold my attention.So...there you have it.

AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ,[f] was a Jewish preacher[13] and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament.[14][15]Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically,[g] although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus.[22][23][24] Jesus was a Galilean Jew[13] who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally[25] and often being referred to as ""rabbi"".[26] He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities,[27] and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect.[28] Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers.[28] After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.[29]His birth is celebrated annually on December 25 (or various dates in January for some eastern churches) as a holiday known as Christmas, his crucifixion is honored on Good Friday, and his resurrection is celebrated on Easter. The widely used calendar era ""AD"", from the Latin anno Domini (""in the year of our Lord""), and the alternative ""CE"", are based on the approximate birth date of Jesus.[30][31]Christian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, was born of a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, whence he will return.[32] Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the dead[33] either before or after their bodily resurrection,[34][35][36] an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology.[37] The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.In Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as Isa) is considered one of God's important prophets and the Messiah.[38][39][40] Muslims believe Jesus was a bringer of scripture and was born of a virgin but was not the Son of God. The Quran states that Jesus himself never claimed divinity.[41] To most Muslims, Jesus was not crucified but was physically raised into Heaven by God.Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited Messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill Messianic prophecies and asserting that the resurrection is a Christian legend.[42]Contents  [hide]1	Etymology2	Life and teachings in the New Testament2.1	Canonical gospels2.2	Genealogy and nativity2.3	Early life, family, and profession2.4	Baptism and temptation2.5	Public ministry2.6	Passion Week2.7	Resurrection and Ascension3	Historical views3.1	Judea and Galilee in the 1st century3.2	Sources3.3	Chronology3.4	Historicity of events3.5	Portraits of Jesus3.6	Language, ethnicity, and appearance3.7	Christ myth theory4	Perspectives4.1	Christian4.2	Jewish4.3	Islamic4.4	Bahá'í4.5	Other5	Artistic depictions6	Associated relics7	See also8	Notes9	References9.1	Citations9.2	Bibliography10	External linksEtymologyFurther information: Jesus (name), Holy Name of Jesus, Names of God in Christianity, Yeshua, and Isa (name)Hebrew, Greek and Latin transcriptions of the name JesusA typical Jew in Jesus' time had only one name, sometimes supplemented with the father's name or the individual's hometown.[43] Thus, in the New Testament, Jesus is commonly referred to as ""Jesus of Nazareth""[h] (e.g., Mark 10:47).[44] Jesus' neighbors in Nazareth refer to him as ""the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon"" (Mark 6:3),[45] ""the carpenter's son"" (Matthew 13:55),[46] or ""Joseph's son"" (Luke 4:22).[47] In John, the disciple Philip refers to him as ""Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth"" (John 1:45).[48]The name Jesus is derived from the Latin Iesus, a transliteration of the Greek Ἰησοῦς (Iesous).[49] The Greek form is a rendering of the Hebrew ישוע‎ (Yeshua), a variant of the earlier name יהושע‎ (Yehoshua), in English ""Joshua"".[50][51][52] The name Yeshua appears to have been in use in Judea at the time of the birth of Jesus.[53] The first century works of historian Flavius Josephus, who wrote in Koine Greek, the same language as that of the New Testament,[54] refer to at least twenty different people with the name Jesus (i.e. Ἰησοῦς).[55] The etymology of Jesus' name in the context of the New Testament is generally given as ""Yahweh is salvation"".[56]Since early Christianity, Christians have commonly referred to Jesus as ""Jesus Christ"".[57] The word Christ is derived from the Greek Χριστός (Christos),[49][58] which is a translation of the Hebrew משיח (Meshiakh), meaning the ""anointed"" and usually transliterated into English as ""Messiah"".[59][60] Christians designate Jesus as Christ because they believe he is the Messiah, whose arrival is prophesied in the Hebrew Bible and Old Testament. In postbiblical usage, Christ became viewed as a name—one part of ""Jesus Christ""—but originally it was a title.[61][62] The term ""Christian"" (meaning a follower of Christ) has been in use since the first century.[63]Life and teachings in the New TestamentA four-page papyrus manuscript, which is torn in many placesA 3rd-century Greek papyrus of the Gospel of LukeMain article: Life of Jesus in the New TestamentSee also: Gospel, Gospel harmony, Historical reliability of the Gospels, and Internal consistency of the New TestamentSee also: New Testament places associated with Jesus and Names and titles of Jesus in the New TestamentEvents in theLife of Jesusaccording to the GospelsLife of JesusEarly life[show]Ministry[show]Passion[show]Resurrection[show]In rest of the NT[show]Portals: P christianity.svg Christianity Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg BibleWikipedia book Book:Life of Jesusv t eCanonical gospelsThe four canonical gospels (Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John) are the only substantial sources for the life and message of Jesus.[64] Other parts of the New Testament, such as the Pauline epistles, written decades before the gospels, also include references to key episodes in his life, such as the Last Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23.[65][66][67] Acts of the Apostles (Acts 10:37–38 and Acts 19) refers to the early ministry of Jesus and its anticipation by John the Baptist.[68][69] Acts 1:1–11 says more about the Ascension of Jesus (also mentioned in 1 Timothy 3:16) than the canonical gospels do.[70]Some early Christian groups had separate descriptions of the life and te"

,Recommended,509220,33657963,Posted: 19 July,all,Tabascofanatikerin,"""Save Jesus"" is a puzzle game with physical elements. Your job is to save THE Jesus Christ from Roman soldiers and a couple of other dangers by killing all soldiers and getting rid of traps that would send Jesus to heaven.You do all that with several types of a ball (a rock with spikes, an inflated cow, a fire ball...), but all these types do the same thing so it's not like one ball is better than another.You need to let this ball roll the right way and/or with the right timing while considering Jesus' safety and helpful items like explosive boxes that can move things around.It's very simple and you can figure out the solutions yourself easily, at least in the first 30 or 40 levels. It can get challenging but not to a level that it'd get frustrating. It rather gets boring due to the rather dull and cheap-looking level and sound designs. Also the boss levels are actually like the regular ones, so they are not really exciting.If you think ""Well, Jesus is in it, so some comedy or controversy must be in it"": No. He just silently stands around and is the only connection to the bible, it could be any character. This also goes for the Romans who just stand there and actually do nothing.""Save Jesus"" is a nice little time waster but nothing more. I'd say: Wait for a discount if you are really interested and don't pay too much for this. But it's not a must have. I don't regret trying it out but it reminds me of how little of these physical puzzle games there are like this on Steam and I wish for more and better ones."
