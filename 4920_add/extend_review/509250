The medium levels are much better than the easy ones and the hard ones even exceed the medium ones!You shouldn't buy this game considering it a climbing game like Climbey. It is more about leaping and reminds me of some old school 3d platformers like Mario 64 at times (especially when it comes to the collecting aspect).I love the variety of challenges it provides (speedrunning to get medals or exploring the levels to find hidden ones) and how it keeps introducing new gameplay elements even during the last few levels.I'd love to see some DLC or even more so a sequel in the future.Do yourself a favor and give this game a chance, even if you're not blown away at first. At least keep playing until you get to the medium levels."

Stupid me.A reviewer reached out to me and told me I was playing it wrong (like climbey). So I bought it again and went back in, looking where I wanted to go instead of swinging my arms. Hours later I pull off the headset, grinning.This is the best movement/racing/climbing VR game hands down. Since you don't run on the ground like windlands, people (my wife) do not get the motion sickness in this title. Because simply pointing and clicking allows you to climb and jump around, your arms don't get as tired as they do in Climbey.This is the best VR game I've bought in months."

76561197965583985,Recommended,509250,31833057,Posted: 18 May,all,Tenka,"WOW! What a rush!This game is AMAZINGLY good, like the VR version of Mirror's Edge in many ways. The way the grabbing system works is a little less realistic but its very intuitive for doing super-fast speed hops from one surface to another. Speed builds up as you successfully hop multiple times and when coupled with surfaces that can effect the way you move it can allow you to build yourself up and .. just .. FLY!The level design is also something to be admired. Each level has a certain amount of ""Geoms"" you have to collect which make for cool challenge points requiring you to really observe the level and use the terrain in many fun and interest ways in order to collect them. There is also a Hidden ""geom"" in each level which are SO rewarding to find and often very challenging to reach.After about an hour's play I have so far only unlocked about a 3rd of the game so I feel like, so far at least, there is plenty of longevity although as I get better at the game I might end up breezing through it. However the existence of Hidden geoms and requiring to collect all the geoms in the game will make for a much lengthier experience overall.Plus, the game is just FUN, like I would come back to any one of these levels just to feel the rush of certain mechanics of each level. I could easily see myself spending 10 hours plus in this game. Seriously if you started playing this game and you're thinking ""meh"" .. JUST GET TO THE LEVEL WITH THE FREAKING HALF-PIPES... HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥Update: 10 Hours ..... HAH!Also as an Oculus Rift user ,SteamVR generally runs very poorly for me. To the Top only supports SteamVR currently but due to the low-fidelity of the graphics it doesnt seem to effect me too much, I have had near 0 frame frops, judder or tracking loss. On top of that, the Dev's went the extra mile to add a Controller tilt/rotate option to the options menu which allowed me to get the hands feeling more or less the way they should on the Touch Controllers. +10 Dev points for that, excellent fore-sight while they work on the proper Oculus Version for Oculus Home.Overall, DONT miss this game .. I 100% recommend it. Must BUY!"
,Recommended,509250,31911904,Posted: 22 May,all,TheSambassador,"This is an absoulte must-buy for VR (as long as you're not super-sensitive to VR sickness).  I haven't had this much fun with a VR game since I first got the headset over a year ago.  No other game lets you fly through the air at these speeds, with just the right amount of control and finesse.  It's an amazing VR platformer, with nice visuals, great feeling controls, really chill music, and enough content to warrent the price.Right now, I have about 2 hours in, and I've done about 1/3 of the levels (getting 100% completion in them).  Given that the later levels are likely harder and will take more time, I'd be very suprised if I am done before the 6 hour mark.  I'd imagine most people would take a bit longer than that if they are 100% completing every level.  I'm also really looking forward to playing this game constantly.There are going to be inevitable comparisons to Climbey.  They are very different games.  TTT is focused on moving fast, doing huge jumps, and flying through the air.  Climbey is more focused on climbing, and you don't ever really get the speeds you get in TTT.  The fact that this game has released with a large number of actually designed levels that have secrets, collectibles, time trials, and tons of level features makes this game win over Climbey any day of the week.  Yes, Climbey has multiplayer and a level editor, but the core levels that come with it aren't very good, and last only an hour or so.  I also don't really want to sift through the thousands of crappy user-created levels to find the best ones.  TTT has far more enjoyable content, and feels a lot more polished.I recommend the crap out of this game."
,Recommended,509250,34278698,Posted: 16 August,all,Annexed,"I highly recommend To The Top - one of the best VR experiences I've had. The movement mechanics take a bit of practice to get good at, but once you do the flow of the parkour-style jumping is joyous.The level design is fun and offers a decent challenge. The music is excellent. There's around 10-12 hours of gameplay if you want to complete the game and get all the achievements - a bit more if you want to beat the gold standard times on every level - and then there's global leaderboards if competitive speedrunning is your thing."
,Recommended,509250,31948811,Posted: 25 May,all,Captain_Dimak,"They weren't kidding in the trailer when they put that big, gratuitous FREEDOM. OF. MOVEMENT.Seriously, I feel more free playing this game than in any other VR game, and I get around pretty well. It feels somewhere between TF2 jump maps and Climbey, with the aesthetic of Mirror's Edge.To The Top trades a lack of accuracy in technical climbing for an exhilarating, leaping, spider man crossed with the hulk crossed with Mirror's Edge experience. You run across the ground, fling yourself into the air, swing from buildings, and glide across roofs. It's a feeling I've been chasing in skill-based movement games since I started to get the itch for this kind of thing. Already set a WR on a map, I'm ready to tackle more!I like just about everything in this game. Here's what I DON'T like:- Handling of relative motion is not completely consistent. Some moving obstacles, while you're attached to them, seem static, and if you jump at the wrong angle, they kill you. Collision damage should be based on relative speed, not absolute.- The skate mechanic can be infuriating. In some spots, it's faster to spam grab your way across gaps than to actually skate.- No workshop map support! This game is missing out bigtime on that front.- Not enough flying levels. The flying implementation in this game is fantastic, but it's not fleshed out whatsoever. It's a huge loss that the climbing element and the flying are barely integrated.And that's pretty much it. Two of them aren't actually issues, they're just me wanting more. None of them are reasons not to buy the game."

,Recommended,509250,32773074,Posted: 25 June,all,› Edgar,"This game is amazing, the combination of fluid fast flying gameplay and the great music give you an endorphin rush as you fly high and jump from point to point, once you get to the point where you can just fly through a level without losing momentum or stopping once its truly sublime.People will make comparisons to Climbey which I also love but it isn't the same, Climbey is more tactical and methodical, with an emphasis on multiplayer, this one is more adrenaline filled flowing from point to point. You will treat the first few challenges slowly, but once  you master the mechanic the level is trying to show you, it just flows and feels really good.You won't regret picking this game up, it goes along Climbey as the best VR platformer, each with their own distinct strengths. The best thing is the game gets better as you go along, the levels get longer, more inventive, and more exciting. The adrenaline doesn't wear off after the first few levels, it just keeps flowing as you play. Game makes me feel mildly high at times when you reach that platforming bliss and the tunes are flowing."

Imagine jumping on and around the outside of a skyscraper. After my first play through of up to the 6th level or so my hands were dripping sweat and my controllers were getting soaked(I wonder how sweat proof they really are). One of the coolest uses yet I've seen of VR and really makes me forget I'm standing around in my room."

I own climbey but I find this more fun to play.  You can take your time finding the collectables or try to speed run the levels.  I've been looking for the collectables to start as it helps to get to know the level then I try to beat the speed time trials.  So much fun, great soundtrack and the graphics suit the game perfectly.Played for almost 2 hours on first go and only complete about 5 of the 30 levels.  The one hidden gem on each level are really hard to get to but it's so great when you manage it.Highly recommend this to anyone.Tip when starting out, look up when building up your jumps rather than straight down at your next jump point to get more height."
,Recommended,509250,32911041,Posted: 27 June,all,Flintlock,"What an amazing and exhilarating game!At first glace it appears to be a climbey type game, not that that is a bad thing as climbey is terrific, but this is a whole other experience. Once you 'get it' you'll be griinning and whooping as you leap from crazy heights and pull off some incredible parkour style moves through a wide range of beautiful and varied levels all to the beat of a wicked soundtrack. Awesome tracks!At the time of this review i'm just over 7 hours in and have been trying to collect 100% on each level before I move on. I just progressed to the medium levels tonight and i'm just blown away at the creative level design and the challenges to get the hidden collectables...(F you Ruins hidden Geom).This is certainly a game that must be experinced in VR to appreciate and while the videos and screenshots are nice, it can never prepare you for the thrill ride this game is. I highly recommend you pick this up if the idea of propelling yourself through, over, under and around massive levels to try and nail a fast run or grab those elusive hidden collectables sounds fun.It's like Sonic the Hedgehog hooked up with Mario, went to lunch in Mirror's Edge and ordered an extra large plate of Ninja Frogger smothered in Rock n Roll sauce!Well done Electric Hat Games! You have a real Geom here. ;)Warning!  If you are afraid of heights, this game will test your vertigo threshhold for sure. Use it to overcome your fears! And yes, I said Ninja Frogger."

Kinda scared of falling, though...Ten Minutes In:  I'M A FREAKIN' SUPERHERO!  WOOOOOOOO!The premise of the game is that you are training to be a superhero, and it absolutely nails that feeling.  You start off stumbling and awkward, nervously leaping across gaps and trying not to look down.  By the end of the ""easy"" levels, you're screaming through levels like an adrenaline-fueled hypervelocity chimpanzee and treating gravity as a minor nuisance that sometimes gets in the way of your craziest stunts.The controls hit that coveted sweet spot of ""easy to learn, hard to master"".  The game introduces new mechanics at a reasonable pace, mixed in with clever and unique level design that forces you to adjust your climbing strategy on the fly.  You can take your time exploring stages to find every last little secret, or attempt to blast through the levels at warp speed.One side note - this game initially scared me off because I have motion sickness issues.  Surprisingly, I've been able to handle it very well with minimal issues.  I wouldn't make this the first VR game you play, but don't be afraid to give it a try."

The art style, controls, level design, and music all come together to create something that simply can't be experienced on a flat screen. I have twelve hours of play time and have just finished all the levels. I spent a good deal of time getting all the medals on as many levels as I could before going through the last few stages. I still have not gotten all of them so I will be revisitng this game again. With new levels planed and multiplayer in the works this game will have even more replay value.

Third level, I dive headlong into the flow of the movement fighting for nearly impossible leaps laughing like a maniac. I finished the first ten levels. I had awful times on some, but incredible fun every time.What I mean by flow is that the movement really does flow. You have a momentum from every successive leap. Soon, you are covering vast chasms with a single leap. It feels so good. This game gets tough quickly, but it seems to be structured to train you to move better and better as the challenge gets so high.Also, I am scared of heights, and this tickles that thrill."

I have to say I'm quite impressed by the amount of joy that can be had with soaring through the virtual air. It's little to nothing to watch but experiencing it is a whole different story.Different from ""Climby"" this game has you soaring much more than climbing. Initially I was going to wait for a sale but quite frankly I think that at 25$ this is a must for any VR owner. Super duper fun game to play or watch your friends trip out on. I can't speak highly enough of the good work put into this.The levels are varied and usually provide much more than one way to get to a place which incites experimentation and choice. Levels are short and because of this it's a good game to swap back and forth with a person. They also make repeating previous levels a joy as learning to run something perfectly can be done in bite sized chunks. Your avatar is customizable as well as your hands. Should you mess up at all the checkpoint system makes it easy to reset to the last checkpoint you hit. Although I had some trouble clicking the wrist menu to reset the whole level.This game is something that any VR owner should have but maybe just if you know you don't get sick in VR at all as leaping and climbing can cause vertigo or nerves or puke.+Amazing gorgeous worlds and levels+Controls feel great+Concept plays out perfectly for VR+Make me feel like a parquor master+Your hands extend off your controllers so you don't have to reach+Levels get more interesting as you go+Speedrunning this is too much fun+So far bug free for me+A secret in every level-Literal balance can be an issue in this game-Some issues with in game wrist menu-Prepare to get sick if you easily get queasy-Low ceiling issues might show in this game if your playspace is short-A little pricy compared to some other VR gamesBe warned though that if you at all have trouble with balance or have a fear of hights then this game might be a bit much to take in.

A variety of interesting platforming experiences and very fun level design.  Early levels in particular can be approached in a variety of ways and as you learn your limitations (Or lack therof) you'll find that you can make incredible jumps with ease.It's also a hell of a workout.LOVE IT.

I've only had a couple of hours in this game so far but it's been a blast!If you are worried about motion sickness, somehow it's very minimal in this game. Even though it doesn't blur vision or narrow the field of view during movement, I don't feel an ounce of nausea. I think the biggest reason for this is one of the gameplay mechanics: you look where you leap. I.e. you will always move in the direction you look.This means you cannot jump backwards, or sideways. And you also have significant air control (you can change direction mid-air) by looking where you want to go.So because of this, you will always be moving ""forward"" relative to the direction you're facing, which is the least likely to induce nausea.Of course, I cannot speak for everyone when I say it won't cause nausea. Your best bet is to try it out for yourself.The way you move around is probably the most fun I've had in a VR game in a long time. Now I want other games with this movement scheme! If there is ever a VR Spiderman game, this is where it's at!Also: you can be as active as you want while playing. You can swing your arms together like a squirrel bounding between tree branches, or you can simply press and release the triggers while looking in the direction you want to jump. It's very accessible for people have limited space, or can't move their arms for long periods of time.Speaking of accessibility, I'm hoping the developers can add an option to snap-turn in increments for players unable to stand up while playing. Just a thought.Altogether, amazing game and one of the best recent releases for VR!"

I only have one minor whish to make it even more awsome.This is by far my favorite VR game jet. And the one I put the most time in too. The movement system is genious. I only feelt a little bit strange the verry few first times I jumped, but once I knew how far and high I would jump, because I got a feeling for it, I never felt any motion sickness. And so was it for everybody I showed the game to.This is for me a legendary move. The first VR Game that nailt local motion.The leves are really really creative and long time motivating. Sometimes they are so hard, that it buggs me or sometimes even frustrated me. But I allowed myselbe to skipp and go on to the next one. To unlock new levels is really motvating.Oh, and there is the music. Man did they nail the music too. They included so awsome songs, that you feel simetimes like dancing while playing the game. It would be even more awsome if you could include your own musil too. But I have nothing to criticize with the games musik, in the contrary ;)My whish: What I whish the game would have done better, is maybe to choose one checkpoint each level, that you can set yourselve, or that you can unlock somehow that you can set yourselve. I wouldn't even needed it in every level, only a few. Because it often happended that there was a really long level and at the verry end there was a spot that was so hard, that I and my friends lost all the time there. This became so frustrating. If we could have set only one checkpoint  ourselves, that would have solved the problem.To the top gave me the best gaming experience I had from any videogame so for. I came into a awsome flow. Its hard to discribe it, you have to experience it. It is as if you become one with your movement and your strategy. In such a state, you cant't make any mistakes anymore. Its magic."

The locomotion system is genius, allowing for incredible freedom of movement while minimizing nausea. The artsyle is reminiscent of mirror's edge, as the climbing surfaces really stand out amidst a clean and pleasant to look at enviroment. Level design starts out rather basic, but what can you expect from the levels meant to teach you the mechanics. As you go further however you'll start to see a wide variety of levels that each have a unique way you need to traverse them and feeling of movement as you do. The soundtrack fits the gameplay quite well, but since there are only ten songs you'll hear a bit of repition if you play a lot. Of course if you get tired of the soundtrack you can always mute the music and play your own.

It's not bad I guess but it's just like turning on a generic radio station instead of having the game's own music.

To The Top is masterfully crafted, the environments are begging to be explored, the music fits like a glove to the gameplay, the leading curve is easy but you'll constantly push yourself to get better at it. When you find a secret area, you really feel like you're exploring outside the bounds of the world (even though you're not).

Running the gamut from silky smooth R&B and Future Bass to Deep House to Shoe Gaze, the infectious head bobbing felt like the most high-flying, acrobatic parkour session.On top of that, a great amount of content, stages with such platforming variety I found myself constantly saying, ""So THIS is what it would feel like to actually be Mario or Sonic!"" Tight, no-latency responsive controls with an innovative, and more importantly intuitive, locomotive interface have shot this one straight To the Top of my weekly VR rotation."
76561197987199121,Recommended,509250,33003246,Posted: 29 June,all,Trityler,"I'm frankly amazed this game has not gotten more attention yet, because To The Top is exactly the breath of fresh air that VR needs right now.Moving around is less about 'Climbing' and more about 'Leapfrogging' from one hold to the next. Along the ground, the feeling is similar to pulling yourself along with skipoles. The momentum you have and direction you fling yourself determines your leap's initial trajectory, but by looking towards where you want to go, you are granted a modest degree of air control. This 'perfectly-imperfect' amount of control helps keep things from getting too easy. The game then does a good job of gradually introducing a few additional mechanics to keep things interesting.Unless you are the type who gets motion sick from VR games that most are completely fine with, I doubt you need to worry about motion sickness. Although on rare occasions, you may be thrown a little off balance for a split-second. If you play in a tight space, it would also probably be good idea to have the headset's Chaparone setting turned on, as you can easily stray a little from the center of your area and reach outside of your play area without realizing.In terms of replay value, that really depends on you. If you are the type to just go through once and never look back, the game's 30 levels will probably only last you a few hours. If you are more of a completionist, you will get much more out of it. There are medals to earn for faster times and getting through more challenging hidden paths. There will also be multiplayer races in the future. Hopefully we will also see more levels in the furture too.The are a couple of trivial things that could be improved. The game's menus are extremely bland. The environments, although certainly posessing a sense of style and diversity, don't offer much in the way of eye-candy. And while the game has some great songs, it is a short playlist. But at the end of the day, core gameplay matters more than superficial asthetics, and To The Top is proof of that."

This is somewhat like Climbey, but much faster, like parcour. It initially takes some time until you understand how to keep your momentum. But when you get it, you can just fly through the levels and that is so much fun. Each level is different, on your first play-through you are always eager to find out what the next level has to offer. There is also a lot of replay value, since you can go for speed runs or completion (collection gems). The levels gradually introduce complexity with new mechanics, which are a lot of fun.If you like fast games, where you can fly through the air, you should definitely get this."

For a ""simple"" control scheme, the devs have really gone all out on how diverse the levels are.  I just did my first run through of a very Mirror's Edge-inspired level, complete with solar panels, skyscrapers and construction cranes.While perseverance will get you through a level, it won't get you any of the medals you'll need to progress.  The levels are very much intended to be learned, then memorized, then exploited to hit the fastest time medal.  Every level has several routes, and usually the most obvious route is not the optimal one.  These levels are HUGE, and only seem to keep increasing in size.  Recently I'd worried that I was becoming immune to VR's biggest feature: presence.  I no longer flinch away from robots in Raw Data, Brookhaven isn't scary.  TTT has my palms sweating every time I play it, which hasn't happened, ever.   The fear of falling combined with the fear of screwing up a set of especially tricky jumps to get a hidden geom, cranks up the experience to levels I haven't experienced in other games.The graphics are ok...like a lower budget Mirror's Edge, TTT uses color coding for you to understand the world.  It feels like the devs may have been a bit overly stingy with their polygon count, but the sheer size of these levels likely demands it.  The art style is consistent and pleasant, and free of overly showy distractions.  Like Awaken, theyre doing the best they can with the budget (monetary and vr-framerate) they've got.Oh and the soundtrack is a nice pleasant surprise, with lots of actual SONGS, not just some repetitive techno beat.  It's an unfortunately small song list, but it's a much better effort than I've heard in ANYTHING else."

Usually when I see a lesser known VR game that intrigues me on steam I wait a while to see how many reviews it gets and if they are positive. Either that or until it starts to get a lot of buzz on reddit. I decided to grab this , because it had caught my attention several times since it was released a few days ago in the new releases tab. It looked like a ton of fun.I am so glad I decided to grab it. This game is a little different than I thought it would be I thought you would have to swing your arms and pull yourself to each platform. The control scheme works different than that though, you use your hands to grab and position within your view, and your head to control the direction you jump / fly in. I suspect this is how they reduced nausea despite the fact that this is a very fast paced title. Its an amazing interpretation of a platformer in VR. The control scheme and locomotion is not something I would consider as hampering the game even though it was different than I thought it would be, unlike some titles where you wish the locomotion/ control schemes didnt get bogged down by the developers trying to illeviate motion sickness I did not feel that with this game.The game itself has a good amount of Content over 30 levels I believe and tons of replayability. You will certainly not master these levels on your first play through. There are secret routes you can take and collectibles on each level not to mention level times , which is where I think most of my replayability will come in, trying to complete levels as fast as I can to not only get medals for faster completions (which unlock new levels) but hopefully to compete on leaderboards. I will attest that I did not notice any leaderboards on my playthrough of the first 14 levels but if they are not there I imagine it is something that will be added when the Dev adds multiplayer in the future (something they have said they will do)This game is not climbey, it is much more fast paced. Its more like a parkour game with jetpacks. Highly suggest it for almost anyone. I am generally not into these types of games as much but this one intrigued me enough to give it a try, and I dont regret it.Edit: I have a few criticisms though after playing a little while longer. During my first play through I was happy to go from level to level just trying every level out, but now for example if I dont get the right time on a level there doesnt seem to be a menu option once your actually in the game. To either restart the level or to go back to the main menu. Your actually kind of stuck in the infinite loop of going level to level until you decide to quit the game and restart it to get back to the main menu as far as I can tell. I have pressed every button on the controllers to no avail when it comes to finding a menu. This seems like a serious design flaw, in a game where posting fast times is important either resetting mid level if you screw up to many times or even deciding to replay the level if you JUST missed the time you wanted would be important features., and they are missing from TO THE TOP. I still recommend this game, but TBH the lack of this feature alone put a pretty big damper on my experience."

Imagine Assassins Creed in 1st Person, climbing to the peak of a level and overlooking your challenges and the entire map, but you know, not boring and repetitive, it's actually fun.The screen shots and videos don't do the visuals justice. In VR, it is sometimes distracting how great everything looks, it's not one of those blurry, jaggy VR games heavily relying on lots of fancy textures.This game starts as a simple ""grab the blue objects to climb"" experience, that gradually transforms into this grand, exuberant mess of exhilaration that I haven't experienced in any other game. The mechanics are simple enough and requires no force to jump distances. Instead you learn to time subsequent jumps like in Super Mario 64 which propels you further along the direction you are looking. You don't need to move your arms but I do it anyway because it creates this really primal feeling I haven't experienced in any other game, it's like being a predator in the jungle, or Mufasa leaping from rock to rock, and even falling feels ♥♥♥♥ing incredible and gets your heart pumping.Even collecting the gems/jewel/crystals things in the game is fun, because it is challenging and you have to think about how you are going to get to certain location and sometimes time your movements, like having to wait for the perfect moment to free fall off of a giant that is moving in order to reach that one last crystal thing you need to unlock the next level, that you know is going to have more cool♥♥♥♥♥shit you didn't expect.Don't miss out on this release if you are at all interested in some exhilarating 1st person Parkour Platforming with huge jumps, skating, sky diving, and more (I haven't finished the game but read that there is some rockets boosters and other cool stuff to be unlocked).I've included a link to a video of me attempting to break the current top score in the Giant Robot Level (which I didn't, but I did reach a personal best by subtracting 10 seconds to my lowest time)https://youtu.be/f-1yX_ACoCY"

The camera moves too quickly when grabbing onto surfaces and changing between using one or both hands. I understand the camera needs to update quickly to show your new position, and maybe there's a reason behind this to reduce motion sickness, but for me it felt jerky. The colour scheme, particularly in the early levels, is not great. I should say that there are many positives to the game, not least of all the fact that it feels a lot more complete than other vr 'experiences'.

Even contents are on par (if not over) my expectations: multiple levels full of alternate paths and secrets.Unfortunately the control method used is just not fun, and break any involvment or realism. It's good from the gameplay side, has a learning curve and after a while (it's not intuitive at his very start) you're jumping everywhere.

You're not going to sweat, to lean, to move arms trying to reach an handle.

But for levels that involve a lot of hop-and-stop....that is, lots of hopping and then stopping at a point to look around and go in a different direction...the nausea kicks in. When you land on the ground, you stop where you land like the ground is sticky tape. I feel like the nausea would be reduced if a ""slide"" was added that slowly brought you to a halt.
