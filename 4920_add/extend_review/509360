,Not Recommended,509360,29995776,Posted: 17 February,all,Freakster,"My Biggest VR Buy regret. Buggy as hell! RIGHT where do I start... I have given this game 6months to sort itself out, Only reason I have given it this much time is because its a VR game and everyones learning, BUT my god there not and its not getting anywhere! It is so Buggy its unreal. Gameplay mechanics are dreadful and you have to die to learn what to do next. Your Character Moves forward on his own and give's me terrible VR Sickness. Things you pick up fall straight through surfaces, or gets stuck in them. You fall through the floor and cant do anything but exit the game (To be honest its a relief when that happens it ends the suffering)I would understand a little more if it was EA, but ive seen EA games make more progress than this one.They don't seem to be working on fixing any of the bugs! I can't play the game in this state. If I showed my friends/family this it would put them off VR for life.And to make this worse there releasing Episode 2, So no wonder its so BUGGY!!!I wish I had refunded it all those months ago..."

I have never gotten motion sickness from any other Vive game. Also, the game has so many objects that seem like they should be interactible that aren't. Escape Room games don't work when the only items you can interact with are part of the solution. Why even put in drawers that you can't open? Furthermore, the solutions seem contrived and unsatisfying. I would give examples, but this game is so short that I don't want to spoil any of the very limited puzzles.I love Escape Rooms, but this was just disappointing."

Motion sickness in the movment, and the puzzles haven't been that fun or intuitive.One of those things, where they hand you a crowbar, but you can't smash the glass in a case that is locked. The game has potential, but at this time I haven't enjoyed it compared to simpler escapa room games on HTC.Maybe it will get better?"
,Not Recommended,509360,24787504,"Posted: 8 August, 2016",all,LrdSnuggles,"Oh boy, this is pretty vomitworthy. I am not prone to motion sickness and had to remove the headset before it did affect me. It often takes control of the camera out of your hands, probably the easiest way to make people feel sick. You walk using the touchpad, which while not my favourite, would be mostly fine if it didn't get repeatedly stuck and continue walking when you aren't pressing anything.The very first scene which has you shaking your head to move a chair didn't work at all until I hit the reset camera button.On the plus side, it looks okay, but I didn't get to interact in detail before bailing out."

The idea is to make you die alot until you fiqure out the nonsensicle puzzle, or rage quit because the key fell through the floor again. It also crashes alot, including steam and making my computer black screen twice. If my video card turns out to be burning out, I'll let you know. I hope it is.tl;dr Another one of those lame UE4 oculus-centric games with moderate roomscale/vive support.Get crowbar, use on tile get key, use shard of plaster from that room to cut light wire (wut), use resulting wire fragment to fix cirtcuit breaker, activate circuit breaker, use key to open desk drawer, solve code (hopefully easy one), then solve room puzzle by studying the 4 moves it makes and reversing them, resetting for mistakes. finale. see decent female avatar, keep review as is.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=892732116"

76561197961314175,Not Recommended,509360,24766030,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,Hurla,"Saying the locomotion is broken is an understatement. Once in a while It moves in a general direction without me doing anything. When you do want to move and use the trackpad, it can't figure out where ""forward"" is. Is always shifted to the right or left. There is also a gap between the virtual floor and the real one. I thought it was a calibration thing but its only happening in this game."
,Not Recommended,509360,30133413,Posted: 23 February,all,Madrox,I can't recommend this game.  The puzzles are either too simple or make almost no sense.  The little story addition is lame and wastes time.  Very little to interact with and the things you can are often annoying to grab.
76561198338978248,Recommended,509360,26612918,"Posted: 15 November, 2016",all,kofoxygen,Really interesting concept.It's pretty refreshing to play a VR game that is pretty slow paced and it puts you in different scenarios in a way that makes sense without taking you away from the immersion.I can't wait to say what Trespass Episode 2 has in store and I look forward to seeing what kind of new scenraios there will be.
,Not Recommended,509360,30207678,Posted: 26 February,all,GreiBush,"No in-game menu, the puzzles are ridiculous, the physics are horrible, low-poly models, bad audio, you can't save your progress, and you and at least one object can definitely fall through the floor.Do not buy this game.Apparently, they have a part 2.  I'm not sure why.  They probably should have made sure the first part worked before making a second."

Later died. The save had the switch turned on.Tiny Spoiler to see why it is a problem:I shut off electricity, moved past light, which fell, no problem.Move past to cell with floor tile. Head back to desk to get crowbar. New, second light falls, killing me.I am resurected in the cell beyond the light and the electricity is on.Now I'm screwed because you can't get back. The electricity should be off LIKE I LEFT IT."

Great to see these guys listening to the criticisms.

Creepy atmosphere and satisfying puzzles make this a title I would recommend to people who enjoy a VR game with a slower pace.

But I'm not a gamer.I bought HTC VIVE because I'm interested in VR.It is little hard to solve the problem. But I did get some hint from Google & Youtube.This game took about 1 hour+ and I'd not seen the end.I thought that it is a cheat enter the game room. But basketball & Dart game is pretty good.I wanna some more VR contents like this game.It change my thought about 'GAME'
