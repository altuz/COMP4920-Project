76561197992525604,Recommended,509540,26653532,"Posted: 17 November, 2016",all,Vulpeculus,"Since nobody is reviewing this game, I'll give my first impressions after a bit less than an hour of gameplay (and update it once I'd played more). Note that I progressed quite fast in the first level because I already played the demo before (it's the same level).First of all, despite the game, this is not a survival game, but a riddle or escape-the-room-like game.It feels really cool to be driven into a story in VR, I must admit that this seems to me to be one of the first games on Vive to offer a real scenario.Graphics are really good, and scenes are made with an obvious sense of detail, although it looks like for some reason, I'm more annoyed by Vive's halo glares in this game than on most of others (maybe because of a high contrast in luminosity within the scenes). Aliasing is barely noticeable given this kind of detailed graphics.Physics are good (like not as good as Cowbots vs Aliens, but much better than a Chair in a Room), they sometimes glitch a bit, but nothing ridiculous or making everything fly  miles away, and it feels right to not see objects pass through each others (should be mandatory in VR).The game is well polished, and I'm pretty sure that the devs (that communicated quite well so far) will hear the little complains in order to make it even more polished (something like being able to autolock the flashlight in the first level, etc).What stands out in this game is the atmosphere, those who tried the demo would understand. I've only reached scene 2 at this moment, the atmosphere is very different (not that creepy), but the sense of presence is strong and the ambiance is intriguing.Devs claimed that the game's play length is about 4 to 5 hours, so 20 creds seems to be quite a correct price considering that I still have to play a (full-) VR game that offers that much game length with a story.So for the moment, for what I've seen, I recommend it, and if the rest of the game is as good as what i've seen so far, for 5 hours, I'd even highly recommend it !"

In the two hours I've gotten to the fourth 'Room' and I feel like I'm in a position to make a first impression.PROs+ Limited 'Adventure Game Logic' outside of a single entity thus far. That axe knows what it did. I wouldn't of thought of using an axe to do that.+ Some really nice enviroments. SVRVIVE Studios go to town with their time-travel concept. You'll find yourself going from some dingy basement on earth to the CEO's office of a dying alien world. Its varied and when allowed, colourful (more on this in the cons section).+ Is actually a finished product. There's no 'Early Access' tag here. This is a complete product. It may not be the most lengthy, but it certainly feels worth the buck.+ The levels themselves are nicely self contained - These aren't marathon affairs for the most part.CONS- It's too damn dark. This first level and the ship level are definitely criminals of this, which made my first attempt of the first level long winded because I missed a certain key item because it was crammed in a room that lacks an actual natural light. Likewise for the ship level where some bits are just so enclosed it's hard to see - even with a light. I've yet to play either of these stages post patch mind. Maybe it solves this. Will update when I know for sure.- Bugs - Sometimes litterally with the GIANT COCKROACH I stumbled upon in the third level. Made me panic that's for sure...well, till I chucked it away. Moving on though this game has a few game breaking bugs. I managaed to get an item on stage 4 WAY earlier than I should of because it popped out of the desk by accident when I was messing with the unlocked draws. I also had a key item drop through the floor and managed to solve a certain rotating puzzle without the aid of a final lever, practically skipping an entire level.  It seems like a chunk of these are resolved with the latest patch mind.- That axe in the first level.I loved the experince thus far, although I would personally wait till the price drops down to the £12.50 price margin That said, this is a game i'd pay to see more DLC for. A couple quid for one or two more stages every now and then would be fantastic.7/10 Recommend."

As others wrote this is a Escape the room type of game where you have to solve puzzles to progress. The difficulty is just right in my Opinion, but im not very good at puzzle games so maybe others would disagree with this. The Story as far as i experienced it is good too. I really want to know what the Deus Helix is and if my ""employer"" is telling the truth. And there seems to be more than one faction involved too. That is what VR needs most in my Opinion: A good story that keeps the player interested. There are way too many VR Games that have no Story at all and you just shoot things up. Another thing thats good is that they finished the first Chapter before releasing it. Im fed up with EA Titles that promise alot and deliver nothing. So keep up the good work Devs, i hope this Game sells well so that you can continue this project."
,Recommended,509540,30179840,Posted: 25 February,all,Nohanna,"""One of the longest VR games to date"" - Boy, we sure are lacking in long VR games, then, aren't we..The premise is interesting, and I do love a good puzzle, but I didn't really find this one all that compelling. The puzzles aren't exactly groundbreaking, and while the story has potential, it's marred by poor writing and awkward voice acting. A lot of visual glitching, too, like rocks that only exist if you're not looking at them.. Textures are pretty bad overall, except for the ""important"" objects, and there's a lot of loud ambient noise that makes some of the puzzles headache-inducing in the wrong way.The fact that it was easily completed in 4 hours (and only because some of the puzzles are of the ""what the f*** do you even want from me?""-style until you find the one object you need to poke the other object with) with no replay value doesn't help it either, and the whole thing really just feels more like a demo.On the whole, if they improve the writing and get a little less awkward in the voice acting department for the next one, I'll probably come back to the follow-up, but I won't hold my breath.Edit: After some consideration and a bit of sleep, I'm changing my opinion slightly, I would recommend a playthrough, especially given the price point. It wasn't mind blowing, but it did keep me entertained for the 4 hours it took. And really, 4 hours at that price is completely reasonable."

The first ""scenario"" is interesting and enganing, but as you play it you can tell the polish decreases. By the time I got to the 4th scenario, it was so buggy i could hardly play.

To me that was the big alure of this game, instead of spending $5 on a game that will take me roughly an hour to complete and then never touch again (the sad reality of escape rooms, they're only fun once) I picked this little gem up on sale for $10 and got around six hours of amazing gameplay!Pros:- The price, even though I got it on sale I can enthusiastically say that I would not have minded one bit paying the full price.- The graphics, the places this game takes you are all very visually engaging and in some cases absolutly breathtaking!- The voice acting- The overall tone, this game managed to create an intense and at times creepy atmosphere using only music and visuals (this game has NO JUMPSCARES). Their were also some humorous moments too!Cons:- A couple of the puzzles had very unclear instructions and I had to look up a walkthrough to figure them outHonestly, this is in my top 5 list for favorite VR games I've played so far and I look forward to more from this developer!"

,Recommended,509540,28984621,Posted: 3 January,all,Den,"Back when the demo for SVRVIVE was released, it was my first VR experience.  I absolutely loved it, the atmosphere it created and really hoped the rest of the game would stack up to it. It didn't, but it was a good experience.When I played the demo the idea of travelling to the 1970's felt epic, creepy and a little like something straight out of Stephen Kings The Dark Tower mixed with the visual aesthetic of Se7en. When I appeared in the 70's it felt like a different place and time, especially compared to where I was previously. That, coupled with the creepy visuals, the fact that you could HEAR the guardian walking around upstairs and THAT moment with the purple light-bulb, it promised something that was more horror sci fi than anything else. However, the full game just didn't live up to what the demo promised me.I expected and wanted to perhaps transport to a German Bunker during WWII on the brink of being bombed, on the Orient Express amid a murder mystery, under a Colosseum in Rome while a gladiatorial fight is taking place overhead, or in an apartment of a cyberpunk hacker in the year 2150, searching for a digital Helix before some futuristic Japanese death squad blast their way through the door. Though the worlds presented are OK, they're never that interesting, and it's not a good thing when your best level idea is used on the first mission. Instead of an endless stream of possible great ideas, we get samey Alien Worlds and a pirate ship, none of which really inspires.I know it sounds like I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the game, but after such a great demo, I was disappointed. I still recommend the game though, but for no more than around €10/E8/$10. The game would take a typical player around 5 hours.PROS:+Interesting story, and ends with a decent, if predictable conclusion+Great voice acting+Some great puzzles+Good array of different locations-Item physics can be way off-Levels jump between being good to just plain boring-No real consequences during missions. For instance, why can't the guardian in the first level find you if you're too loud?-Some graphical glitches. Found myself inside walls from time to time, etc. No game breaking glitches though.-Sound Design is poor. Could have been incredible. For instance, on the last level a generic cave hum sounded flat. Because of this the game lack atmosphere is could have otherwise had.The devs did a good job, but dropped the ball a bit nonetheless. SVRVIVE could have been a great game, but it has settled to just be a good one."

I didn't have any gameplay object issues like others but I do agree the physics are rough and basic things like opening drawers and doors is frustrating. The one area I wish would be more fleshed out is sound design. It wasn't noticable at first but some of the later levels (especially the last one which looks amazing) would have been much more compelling with better sound design."

Finding yourself on different worlds, from archaic civs to high tech alien societies was a nice touch.

,Recommended,509540,34906318,Posted: 12 September,all,Year Old Milk,"ReviewSVRVIVE: The Deus Helixis a fantastically fun puzzle-solving game that features interesting, unique environments and an intriguingly mysterious storyline. There are 6 levels, each wildy different and a bit more challenging than the last. I highly recommend this game for those looking for a relaxing (albeit sometimes rather spooky), yet challenging, VR experience that will make you think outside the box to overcome your obstacles. The campaign is packed with over 4 hours of mind-bending content that will keep you entertained throughout and wanting more when it's over.Now, that isn't to say that this game is perfect - there are a few small flaws. They are only minor issues; however, and really don't take away from the game. For example, there were a few occurrences where I was able to stick my head through a locked door or area, allowing me to see content that should have been otherwise unaccessible to me at the time. Even though this didn't break the game, it sometimes made it easy for me to guess what the next steps to solving the puzzle would be. It would be nice if there were physical barriers in-game that stopped players from being able to peek through unaccessible areas. Also, there were a few instances where I felt that it was hard to determine if an object was interactable or not.I bought this game for use with my Oculus Rift when I saw that it was on sale for $11.01 (42% off). At this price, the game is a steal. I would still recommend this game at full price due to the amount of entertainment value that it offers. Not many VR titles offer this amount of content at such a low price.Pros6 fun, challenging puzzlesInteresting, unique environmentsMysterious storyline4+ hours of playable contentConsProgress is saved only after beating a level - if you quit the game in the middle of a level, you'll have to restart it next time you playIt is sometimes hard to tell if an object is interactableThere are a few minor bugs that could use some polishingTipsAlthough obvious, here's one quick tip that I recommend you use in order to ensure that you'll enjoy this game without frustration: make sure that your Room Scale is calibrated properly before playing. More importantly, make sure that your floor level is calibrated properly. When I first played the game, my floor level was set a bit higher than it should have been, which resulted in occurrences where I was unable to pick up certain small items off the ground. After recalibrating my sensors; however, my issues were resolved."

I'm only giving this a negative review due to my repeated frustration with the mechanics and general bugginess of the game at release(even after the latest patches).Warning: Potential Spoilers Ahead(to address issues with game)On many occasions, I've had to restart a level due to certain objects going missing/being lost by clipping in the world.  The third level(pirate ship) proved to be especially troublesome.  It took several attempts(and some luck) to finish this one due to buginess.  For example, the first attempt, I haphazardly found the key to the cupboard from the captain's desk.  I slid a switch thingy and noticed it just laying there, so I knew that's where it came from.  I proceeded no futher on that attempt due to the loss of controller bug.  When that was fixed I tried again, but this time I could not get the key to appear no matter what I did.  That's when I discovered that many of the world objects do not prevent clipping.  I was able to actually stick my head into the locked safe in the desk and not only see the key(and another hidden item, but also use my controller to grab both items through the wall without ever having to unlock the safe(with another key found later).  Even entry into the captain's room itself I found buggy as trying to grab the door and teleport inside was way too difficult(door always snaps shut).  I eventually found it easier to just ignore the door altogether and just keep teleporting and with my head sticking through the door(no clipping) I could just continue teleporting inside.  Many of the doors/cabinets work like this and I just learned to ignore them altogether.  I also had issues with important game objects getting stuck in the world, or falling through it if dropped.  It would also be nice for an option to make the grip object a toggle so you don't have to hold the trigger all the time, since some objects require you to teleport around with them.So instead of enjoying and/or being frustrated by the puzzles of the game itself, I ended up being much more annoyed with the bugs to lose myself in the very thin storyline of the game as it is.Not sure why this was pushed to release in the state it is in.  Seems like it could have done with a bit more QC testing/bug smashing.  If they weren't game-breaking I could live with it and a mostly positive review, but for now I'm left advising people hold off on purchasing until it is in a much more playable state."

Aside from the fact that ""svrvive"" is one of the worst title puns I've ever seen in a game (though I have to give credit to the devs for openly admitting it), it doesn't even really make sense, both because story-wise your character is dead from the moment you even start the game and because in the levels you don't really do any actual surviving, since there are no enemies or real threats. But thinking up fun new ways to pronounce ""svrvive"" was a good way for me to make my own fun while playing the game, so I can't fault it that much.SVRVIVE isn't lacking in terms of content, featuring a voiced storyline and at least 5 escape levels. I say ""at least"" because even though the 5th level seemed like the last one I admittedly did not finish it, because by the time I reached that point I was beyond tired of the game and when I had to go through a second loading screen in the middle of that level just to solve a single puzzle that consisted solely of literally sitting down on the floor and staring in a single direction for several moments I was done with the game. The game's quantity comes with a severe lack of quality, and most of the levels are several times too big for the puzzles they contain and most of the challenge comes from wandering around in overly dark maps (the game permanently attaches flashlights to both controllers for good reason) fumbling with things that may or may not just be trash. The puzzles themselves range from average to ""is this even a puzzle"", and some of them border on pure trial and error. The levels are pretty to look at, and cover an interesting variety of genres, but some of them are huge just for the sake of being huge and make you do stupid things like teleporting around an area the size of several rooms opening pots to find orbs, which is apparently considered a puzzle to some people.SVRVIVE isn't the worst VR game I've played or even the worst VR escape game, but if even I don't have the patience to finish an escape game I can't expect anyone reading this to."

It's like ""Espace type of room game""  A little expensive, but if the Dev say it's about 4-5 hrs, then I'm okay with the price.  You get visit an alien planet and try to solve that puzzle, which is cool, because the Dev add something different since it's alien environment and technology.  Great Job guys!"

It does however have atmosphere and an interesting story.  I will play it through to the end once I upgrade my graphics card and finish my current spell of depression."

The ground is calibrated properly on my vive yet I can't reach low enough to pick stuff up off the floor, so whenever you drop something, you can't pick it up again. They say things will go back to their original position eventually, but when? It happened once but then I dropped something again almost immediately and waited 10 minutes before exiting the game. This was on the very first mission.The game overall looks like it might have been fun but I couldn't tell you because I paid 25$ for something I couldn't even play. Refunded."
