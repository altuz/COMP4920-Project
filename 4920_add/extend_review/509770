76561198273030403,Recommended,509770,32319862,Posted: 10 June,all,Bobby Espinal,"I really like survival/crafting games, but many of them contain zombies. Post-Collapse eschews that idea and forces the player to just SURVIVE in a post-apocalyptic world, making it feel like a more realistic survival experience. Furthermore, the isolation makes the loneliness feel palpable, as though players really HAVE survived the end of the world and are now just trying to get by on a daily basis. Furthermore, the developer does a good job of replying to Steam members with questions about the game, and he also releases a significant update at least once a month, as well as smaller, unannounced updates here and there. The low price tag of $7.99 is also more than enough reason  to give the game a try. With the relatively frequent updates, the game will likely only get better, so I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of survival/crafting games."

(add bear sounds)maybe add wolves just at night ? (faster than bears )should least see him coming at least.things maybe to add - icid rain , standstorms - (random times)snakes , rats ,  (poisonous ) bear traps.antibiotics , to combat poison.weapons - rifle, knife , bullets."

76561198312322816,Recommended,509770,31228918,Posted: 18 April,all,WolfCall,"PostCollapse is in it's infancy but with a lot of growth potencial and no..no zombies (yet) which IMO is fine. With a few bores, an occational bear and some radiated areas, the only real threat is trying to survive through the harsh winters.I started with the smallest house (fewest windows) which didn't require to many materials. I have since explored around the map and located a large town.  I found a larger house in this town and slowly aquired the materials to make this my new Headquarters. Making several trips back to original HQ to retrieve all the stored material I had there, i now have a pretty good HQ. I didn't like the boarded up windows so I gathered blocks from a bldg close by and blocked in all the windows. :)I also chose a HQ close to a river for unlimited access to water.Building additional storage helps me stock more supplies/materials making winter survival a bit easier.Made weapons capable of killing bears which is a great source of food.The game is limited atm but there is so much to do and learn.I have played as if I was put in a real life situation and I have successfully just survived my 10th winter.I would highly recommend this game to every one who likes to slowly but meticulously work there way to success."
76561198038570177,Recommended,509770,26756171,"Posted: 22 November, 2016",all,Ryder,"Yet another good start on a survival title using mechanics that are basic but solid.  Real survival... not fantasy zombie dinosaur infested survival...  so to make this work, the kinds of crafting and innovation you would have to do in a real situation will need to be explored and developed.At this point, the game is methodical...I get that the day/night cycle is compressed, and therefore eating and drinking... but it seems far too compressed to me.  I'd make it at LEAST 3x slower.It would be good if seasons were incorporated in a platable way (currently, winter only passes as ""fast forward"" event directly to summer... but you do need to stock supplies first as winter depletes them.There is very little ""game"" here yet... but a good start."

76561198035512808,Recommended,509770,31364879,Posted: 25 April,all,Rianya,"Overall I like this game although there are elements I'd like to see altered. It's not terribly expensive and it's still being improved which makes it absolutely worth buying in my book.I like a survival game without zombies (it's a nice change).I like the leveling and crafting elements.I don't like the way ""sleepiness"" is handled.I'd like to see winters be a time when we can work on crafting skills if we build up enough supplies.I'd like seasons to be longer. It would be really nice to have the seasons closer to those in Project Zomboid where we go through the months with each day being an hour or so long.It would also be nice if there were more of a storyline (maybe finding recipies in libraries or hunting down clues for a survival compound.) It would also make a great format for a multi-player game."
76561198022815390,Recommended,509770,32614800,Posted: 21 June,all,FiveSixtyEight,"Needs quite  bit of polish but it's a solid and atmospheric survival game with a particularly good sense of solitude.  I'm hoping the developer might add options when starting a new game to adjust the global speed, even playing in hardcore mode it still feels like time is moving too fast.  The game has a vast procedural world but these time constraints mean that you never have much time for exploration because you need to sleep every few minutes, hope this will be adressed in the future.  Great game though!!"
76561198031480865,Not Recommended,509770,33356027,Posted: 7 July,all,Delroy,"I really wanted to like this game.  It looks like it has a lot of potential and is the kind of game I've been enjoying lately.  However right now all it seems to amount to is five summer game days running around like a fool trying to accumulate enough food, liquids, and wood to survive twelve winter game days without starving, dehydrating, or freezing to death.  There is some crafting that may make that easier but you don't really have time to do a lot or you won't get enough supplies to last the winter.  Like I said, I think there is a lot of potential here and I will keep an eye on how it developes.  But right now I can't really recommend it.  There is a lot of balancing to be done."

76561198053184399,Recommended,509770,31232831,Posted: 19 April,all,Fade Willow,"I have just found this nice little game and decided to give it a try out and add it to my Early Access Showcase section of my Youtube channel.For an early access game still in development it is very playable and easy to get along with.It makes a welcome change to have a survival game with no zombies in it but still have the danger of wild animals and a sense of having to survive.From what i understand so far is you need to gather food, water & materials and set up a headquarters or base before the winter sets in to survive. You can do this by searching containers, hunting, fishing and crafting.Obviously there is a lot of room for improvement to the game and I am very interested to see how this game develops and what will be added in the future.For now though it is a very nice low price and one to keep in your Steam library and watch the development.My full playlist for this gamehttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJcmAk9VUnqlnaMwbBv_WSGH3b-WaloNBWatch my first look video herehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji6AlpJ52oo"
76561198088217136,Recommended,509770,30230455,Posted: 27 February,all,Tumult,"This game is pretty fun, at first everything you do is taxing on your body, HOWEVER that's what leveling up is for! You can level up certain stats that allow you to make certain chores easier on you, such as holding items (which all have weight), chopping wood, fishing, farming, and also hunting! The game has some bugs right now such as animals having superspeed quirks, but aside that minor issue the game is great even as an early access! It just needs more content, which i'm sure they're already working on.The game does a good job giving you a simple and fast tutorial using a small amount of text, which surprisingly explain all you need to do. Plus these quests give you EXP so easy level up, and makes the journey early game easier.I think the beginning quest for potato seeds should be changed however, I completed the quest once, but when i did my second playthrough i literally spent a whole hour looking through cars looking for potato seeds. I had 7 carrot seeds and 8 turnip seeds and had found no potato seeds within that hour. I think the quest should be changed to any seeds xD"

Everywhere looks the same so be ready to get lost numerous times whilst trying to build your headquarters, although it is beta and can improve it will take some doing.For the developers i would say focus more on the deterioration of your food and water which goes down way to fast.More things added into the houses possibly furniture and that whole Winter freeze to death thing i would remove it andupdate it more towards that you can play the winter time but need a flame to keep your warm or introduce the clothing aspect to it.All in all i would recommend this game if your into survival games as it can only get better.Keep me posted on updates i will be sure to play it again once a few things have been changed."
,Recommended,509770,29875000,Posted: 12 February,all,Beanbag37,"Not bad, but still needs improvements. I don't like the fact that after the winter is over I lose a lot of stuff from my cupboards. I know some of it is used to survive the winter, but that much, takes too long to stock up. Has some graphics glitches but nothing too serious. The towns are too repetitive, needs different buildings made out of different materials. I'm giving it a thumbs up because it has a lot of potential to grow and become much more enjoyable. Definately needs more animals. All i've come across so far are pigs, rabbits and dears. I know it's still early days yet so i'll just be waiting for more content to be added. Still enjoyable to play."
,Recommended,509770,31145454,Posted: 14 April,all,g33k5t4,"Pretty decent game so far. Still has a long way to go before it's a full ""game"", though. But, when you buy early access, this is to be expected. My biggest complaint so far is with crafting. Unless I'm missing something, you can only craft one of anything. So, if you need to make 50 boards, expect to open the crafting interface from the beginning 50 times. There should also be some way to mark your headquarters. Hopefully the developer will flesh this game out more and not leave it in developer hell like so many early access games get."

76561198123172860,Recommended,509770,35000459,Posted: 16 September,all,Rheistand,"Bought this game on a whim, as most of the games i've bought in dev; and that's not many, have left much to be wanted. This being said I found this game to be great so far. The feeling of complete isolation and self reliance make this one of the most realistic first person games i've ever played. Only detraction I have so far is that I have not yet found any use for matches, if there is one. If you want a game that you can do anything , this isn't for you as the focous is a simple and harsh realilty of survivial. You are truly on your own. And yet after playing I have to say there as a certian charm to the emptiness."

,Recommended,509770,29674489,Posted: 3 February,all,Elegant Caveman,"Recommended only because I'm not not-recommending it. I find myself again wishing for a ""neutral"" vote.The game, presently, is very bare-bones. I'd only recommend purchasing right now if you want to support the dev(s?). I played three hours, and I don't really feel like there's much more for me to do. I'm certainly looking forward to future updates, though.It's another ""survive-o'-craft in Early Access with potential"". Take that as you will.This game stands out for being single-player-only, though, and the only threats you face being natural ones (no zombies or monsters), two things I heartily approve of.If that sounds interesting to you, I'd certainly recommend wishlisting/following/keeping an eye on how things develop."
76561198136492089,Not Recommended,509770,34335261,Posted: 18 August,all,dawg_soldier,"THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON ITS EARLY ACCESS STAGE.I've had this game on my watch list for some time and as it was on sale (£3+) I thought I'd give it a go, seeing as the latest reviews about it were positive.Now I knew in advance that this game wasn't going to blow my socks off, but after playing it for an hour I feel like I've already done all that can be done. Wander around the map clicking on cars/cupboards/fridges to sometimes find items (trying to find nails/scrap metal/wire took too long), eat and drink every couple of minutes and sleep every ten to fifteen minutes to get to the next day.Just a few things I would definitely work on - matches run out after about five seconds, torches after maybe a minute.Following the path up and then following the same path down but somehow the laws of gravity don't register and it's almost like you've fallen down a hill, so you injure yourself.The music is pleasant enough to listen to but that's the only thing I can really give praise to so far.Like I've said, this is a cheap game and it's in early access. Maybe I'll come back to it once more work has been put in. But as it is at the moment, it doesn't stay entertaining for long at all."

In fact it is similer to the 7 day cycale of 7 days to die, where a horde of zomibes spawns every 7th night. you have X number of days to build, stalk up, and get ready. however unlike 7 days to die,Actions take time and reduce food, drink, and sleep. makes scents but it takes 10 or so minets to search a contaner for loot (and i mean refrigorators and all that jazz).The buldings look like MC escher patinings on the inside and offten have nothing in them. and I dont mean anyhting to loot, I mean there will be nothing on the inside at all or diffrances in rooms. just building shells. when there are, you can ususaly loot it- and they are offten in odd and very obscure or obstructed places.Looting consits of a small popup winow that you can transfer stuff aorund in. I never made it to crafting or to a point where I couldnt not carry anyhting but I assume you can build personal storage and make a stash.food and Drink go down faster then I feel they should given the enviorment, and sleep is more or less on par with what you would expect.I got to day 7 by sleeping and havieng a full invetory of food. if winter was not there, you could do that as long as you had the loot. it also looked like, and I could be wrong, there was no lanscape change during winter. it just gets cold and you get hungery faster. nothing eles seemed to change, and that somewhat dissapointed me.everything is time managment and rng. you more or less grind for stuff. ""hardcore"" mode even sayes in the description that it will be more boring and longer drawn out, and may have been slihgtly more fun.I will say, twhen it gets dark, it gets very dark and few games do that. however the only thing I came across that would hurt me where boars and they where not that bad. so more or less I just walked aound in the dark looking for food.The level taraine also has some odd spawning glitches that look similer to 7DTD alhpa.there are a lot more points that I could cover just from the 25 minets of play, but I will end it there.I think palying 7DTD with zomibe spawns off would be a better simluation of what I wanted this to be. All in all its not a BAD game. its just not one I want to paly :I"

In its current state it is fun but feels like a very limited experience in terms of immersion, a few zombies would sort that right out though.
