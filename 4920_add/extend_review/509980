I would love to see more maps and different ""monsters"" like the south american chupacabra and maybe skandinavian trolls? with different ways to defeat them. as a easly scared person this was shitbreaking, but i think for most people its no quite there yet. Great potential and i will play again when its been updated more. Keep on working on it please!Edit: I played 1.2.1. I haven't played since"
,Recommended,509980,32910575,Posted: 27 June,all,Oxnar60,"FULL YET BRIEF REVIEW (PROS/CONS):This is an open world survival horror game in which the player (alone or with friends) attempts to find and capture bigfoot. The feeling of roaming around an open world not know where he is and knowing that he can attack at any moment is horrifying yet thrilling for me. As a big fan of open world and survival horror games, this definitely is a must own.PROS:- Live CCTV camera monitoring- Additional objectives (finding lost tourists)- Surplus of equipment that's fun to use- Advanced mechanics like covering traps in leaves to hide them- Brilliant sounds- Large map with several waypoints- The game requires strategy as Bigfoot is a strong enemyMAJOR CONS:- No instructions (there are some tips hidden in the corner of the screen, but the controls are slightly confusing and hard to figure out initially.)- Poor ""Guide"" (we are left with a two page guide explaing who Bigfoot is. The objective is simple but offers no insight onto how it might be achieved.)- Night vision (it just sucks...it's harder to see with it than without it due to the saturated green color.)- Bigfoot's reach (even if in the camper, he can attack you through walls...you're basically always at risk even in your supposedly ""safe spot"". It's frustrating if you die because you are attacked through a wall.)MINOR NOTES DUE TO EARLY ACCESS RELEASE:- Graphics issues (60FPS is doable if shadows are disabled; things need to be optimized.)- Small Location Issues (the way some objects in the camper are set up makes it hard to look out windows optimally.)- Batteries (plenty of them, but you can't carry them with you. The way batteries work seems inefficient.)- Certain Supplies (Plenty of supplies we don't always need.)- Language (the language in this book is mostly written in a slightly awkward broken English.)-Bigfoot's neon green blood(...why?)Overall, this game kicks♥♥♥♥♥ It runs very vell for me and the gameplay is good. There are very few cons that are easily outweighed by the pros. Some of the smaller notes will be fixed with time due to the game currently being in early access. Once the game is figured out, it becomes a very fun yet difficult challenge that forces you to use your resources wisely and try to capture Bigfoot. If this sounds even remotely cool to anybody reading, then I think you will enjoy this game (especially if you like survival horror games). I think with the addition of new maps, fixed gameplay mechanics, and other new features and tweaks being added soon, this game will become very popular. I would recommend this game."

,Not Recommended,509980,33600155,Posted: 16 July,all,Richard,"**WARNING**: According to the ""general"" user-base for this game, this review may contain a few spoilers, (I can't seem to find them, and I wrote the damn thing). But be warned that it does speak about several key-points of the game.Where do I even start here:I wanted to like this game, I bought it for my girlfriend and I just to see how it was, and actually a 3rd friend bought it because he saw we were playing. So $45.00 worth in this game from guys on my network; here's what I've noticed / seen:- Initially when I attempted to connect / host a server, I kept getting `No online sub system steam found` -- which was resolved by restarting my computer. A bunch of others received this error and have submitted in the discussions section of the game, and no developer has replied with a solution. So if you do get it, try completely closing steam and re-opening it OR restart your computer completely and re-sign into steam.- Once I finally got in, it took two loads to actually get into a server we were hosting (I crashed twice, and my 3rd friend crashed once as well).- After actually getting into the game, we noticed the game is NOT optimized. I run an R9 390X 8GB video card, and very poor frames, and sometimes huge spikes where I would freeze for a few seconds. Same thing happened to my girlfriend and my other friend.The game itself as very anticlimactic. You pretty much hunt down Bigfoot, and continue to shoot him until he falls, and then you tie him up and drag him back to camp; and OH BOY, THAT part was FUN.I should add that we managed to kill him because he got STUCK in the river, under a tree that goes across the river. His body was underneath the tree, and he was stuck there for almost 15 minutes, all he would do is just growl and scream. So we just stood and shot him.Walking while you're dragging bigfoot is next to impossible. The little bed that you're dragging him on glitches out so bad, it was morphing in front of me, to the side, and it even would flip up into the air and keep spiking to and from its location. Then it somehow flipped me into the air when I stopped walking, and I lost half my health when I finally came down.Screenshots:http://i.imgur.com/sWnnaoT.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/DaF45jH.jpg(The smudge to the right is bigfoot)http://i.imgur.com/kJUxp4U.jpg(The black smudge to the left is bigfoot flying around)Here is a screenshot of dragging him back and my friend ""floating through the air with his legs crossed like he's sitting"" --http://i.imgur.com/42cPg3p.jpgA few of the screenshots show a blurry bigfoot because he was literally glitching so fast through the air / into the ground, we couldn't take the shot to show him clear enough. This happened the entire time from where we caught him -> bringing him back to base.Once we got him back, dragging him near the cage was a difficult task. He would glitch into things, and then fly into the air and come back down. You had to do pretty wide turns around certain objects in order for him to not glitch and come into contact with them. After finally getting him in, the ending was very... I can't even think of a word, maybe non-existent? I won't go into detail because that'll ruin it for anyone who hasn't played, but be prepared. If you blink, it's over.From a development stand-point, the game was developed in Unreal Engine, which I also use for games I develop with my team; and it seems like the game was rushed. My BIGGEST trigger; is when I actually went into the server browser, I instantly recognized the server list layout. It's taken from a tutorial available on youtube with a provided download link. It's basically a pre-existing template which allows you to connect your game to steam and have browsable servers.Why does this trigger me? Because any developer serious about their game, should actually take the time to re-design the LAYOUT AT LEAST, and put some care into it. The layout is exactly the same, down to the red error messages that appear when you get the sub session issue. So this was a major let down, because I could never imagine releasing a game that used stock templates from Unreal Engine tutorials.Finally, the price of $15.00? No way. I've bought games before that I've disliked, but never asked for a refund from steam, as it wasn't worth the hassle of doing, however, I can say that this is the ONLY game I've ever wanted to refund, because it just disappointed all of us that bad.All three of us are requesting refunds for the game. Sadly, I have 4 hours because I kept trying to give it a chance, but as I got deeper into the game, it got worse and worse. But the other two friends have under what the refund requirements are. It's sad, because I've never wanted to refund a game in my life, and I'm pretty understanding of Early Access games and them containing bugs, but this one, I find the bugs that exist as just carelessness in development, and could have been resolved with just a few days of bug fixing.As I said, I wanted to like this, but there's just too much here that is wrong, and I'm actually shocked it's a purchasable game. I'd never in a million years allow a game in this condition to be something attached to my name that I am selling. Not to directly hit at the developer, because I'm sure he's put a lot of work into this, but an extra few weeks of just focusing on these issues would have made it a great game.Regards,Richard"
76561198087729370,Recommended,509980,30191686,Posted: 26 February,all,Andersen,"It took me and my friend about 2 and a half hours to capture a bigfoot. We traveled around and fooled about for probs 1 hours of the playthrough just to check how big the map truly was. We weren't disappointed! The game is terrifying if you play it by yourself in a dark room, it was even scary for the first hour of our coop gameplay, due to us being two crybabies.Pros:-Graphics are really sweet, with a decent level design to support it.-Camera system, traps and being able to hide traps with branches.-Good progression, it takes a while to kill bigfoot but you can also find 4 lost tourists for exploration sake.Cons:- Sound quality is really bad, with everything from desyncronized footsteps to the bigfoot's roar being awful. I also heard a lot of sounds my buddy didnt.- It seems that the night time is about 2-3 times longer than daytime, making it essential to use ur day to place cameras,and really hinders you for the exploration for the huge map.- Game is a bit buggy, biggest con would be how my buddy crashed and we had to find a new gun for him. The wildlife (or should I say, deer?), is also very buggy, my buddy saw deer I couldn't and vice versa. This made us think that the deer had no gameplay significance at all, which we still believe.- Bigfoot has a very simple pattern, and ends up attacking your van every single night. We had a night with 3 attacks at the exact same location (window next to camera setup.Overall:This game has huge potential in being scary, unpredictable, and very DLC-able. I personally can't wait for more updates and maybe some harder difficulties (make him more unpredictable with new animations and ''what the Fk'' moments. I was expecting a moment where he'd come ambush from underwater in the swamp or something like that. I am stoked for the snow map with hopefully a scarier version of the bigfoot (yeti?). Great potential, great first time experience. I give this Early Access game a solid 6/10. And do I recommend for the price? Yes. It's cheap, and should give a blind playthrough AT LEAST 2-3 hours."

This is a crazy game and for being early access, it is worth it. It didn't take me long to be chased and attacked by Bigfoot and scared the cr4p out of me. You can set cameras up and go explore. there are many options. I found a bloodied campsite where people got murdered. It's near the lake. It's very open and spooky.I've played many games and this one is very good for being new. I'm hoping that it keeps expanding.The only Con is that the programmer misspelled a few words but who cares!!I'll update when things improve"

The update has been delayed twice over a spand of 3 months. DO NOT buy this game for the time being, Wait till the game is updated or dont buy it."
,Recommended,509980,32971238,Posted: 28 June,all,Y.,"I bought Bigfoot after seeing a few videos on Youtube that appeared to show a solid game with interesting mechanics and a large world to explore in. After the first hour I played on my own however I found that without other players this game just does not deliver a fun experiance because of several reasons. The first issue I noted is that the day cycle is far too short for a single player to accomplish any exploring since most of your time has to be spent setting up traps and cameras which I felt took away one of this games strongest assets. Another issue that I found as a single player is that actually hunting bigfoot once you spot him is just plain annoying because his model isn't representitive of his range or hitbox and he can easily kill you in two hits. Other than this I noted that there was just a general lack of interesting events on my own and after finding extra guns, traps, and ammo scattered around the map I reached the conclusion that this game just is not designed for single player. I guess in a way this makes sense because if bigfoot was real and you were alone in the woods with him he would probably kick your a$$ and it wouldn't be very fun at all.Fortunately I had some money to burn and I gifted a copy of this game to a friend, and once I had another player with me the experiance I had with this game vastly improved. This game was incredibly fun with a friend because exploration felt more possible, traps and cameras were less tedious, and bigfoot was no longer a death machine but he still felt powerful.  Multiplayer is definately what this game excels at but I am disappointed that it delivers a subpar single player experiance.Pros:-Good gameplay-Full and interesting map-Bigfoot is real-Graphics-CCTV system is very well done-Amazing atmosphereCons:-Only one map so far-Animations could use some work-Bad single player experiance-Hitboxes are buggy-Traps feel tedious and almost require multiple players to efficiently set up-Frequent crashes-NEEDS to be optimized-Underdeveloped tutorial-***EARLY ACCESS***"

76561198200196371,Recommended,509980,33699755,Posted: 21 July,all,Samuelddragon,"Bigfoot is a really atmospheric and survival horror game that throws the players into Jasper Park (and eventually a mountain area) to go out and catch Bigfoot. The game doesn't tell you how to go about it and that's a really good thing! You could look up tutorials but the game is so much more fun if you go into it blind as me and my friend did. Players can place, and hide traps to damage Bigfoot or they could use tracking bullets to chase after him. Random events will trigger like a tree slowly falling over or lightning striking a tree nearby. When these events happen you can NEVER expect it. And plenty of noises of birds chirpping, owls hooting, and water going down the river makes the game emerse you into it's world. The graphics are also pretty good, and are gonna get better in future updates. The game also gives you an excitement whether its good excitement or terrifying excitement. In this game you could hide in the trailer during night. This won't keep you safe from Bigfoot. But the game does make it clear that YOU are hunting Bigfoot. YOU should go out and try to find him even during night. Even though Bigfoot is gonna put up a fight. The mechanics of the game are good too. The only thing I found a little weiird is to cover a trap with leaves you need to press v. Which the game doesn't tell you. But that's a SUPER small nitpick. And the most important thing is that this game has developers who care about their game. So many early access games don't get finished or barely get any updates but these developers gives updates on what they've been working on and clearly show that they want the product to be good. And with the mountain update coming soon. I'm sure this game will just get better. This is a game that you should deffinetely play. Even if you don't like horror games that much."

,Recommended,509980,29694961,Posted: 4 February,all,[NgU] MA5KU,I have played this game only about 2 hours and died 2 times already first one was just like 45 mins just wondering around and trying to find the bigfoot. I had placed all the camera and was pretty happy what I had done. He set 4 of them off and lost some of his hp but never really saw him through the cameras. After that I was walking down on some rock wall and lost third of my hp for no reason wierd... But anyway i was heading back to my RV when he just surprised me and smacked me in the face and ran off. I got lucky because i hitted him with my tracer round but then i realised he was heading towards my RV like really? then he stopped turned around and was heading my way I was like this is not going to end well and soon I died because i didnt run to the opposite direction. Second time I died inside my RV and if you are wondering is the RV a safe spot?? Let me tell you it isnt he runs at it slams the door open comes inside and smacks you and runs away D: and he opens the windows too for some reason to smack you again.  but honestly yes this game is awesome I really enjoy the feeling off getting scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but yes yes the game needs some improvement and maybe more medkits. 2 inside the RV seems pretty useless if you thing how much the bigfoot can hurt you. Any way I just really enjoy playing it and definitely recomment it. If you think buying this game maybe its the best if you get it on sale or if you cant wait just buy it.

Honestly the update was supposed to come out 2017 June, and the devs would of had time to finish. But I still have very little hope about this game, and i just think the next ""delay"" they announce, the game is gonna get cancelled lmao. ...And yes i do understand that it takes time to develop a game, but this long, no. This is the problem with dev's who make creepypasta games, take Rake for example, the dev's jsut abandoned the game and the multiplayer dosen't even work. Thats what im worried about this game. Like I said, i have very little hope, but for now, I dont recommend this... EDIT: I also think the devs have a toxic attitude when it comes to players fanbase. Recently also ppl have been claiming that there keys r getting revoked because they have an ""Early Access Copy"" of the game, but on the main page, it still says the game is early development and ppl are getting scammed of their money. This might be the worst speculation that dosent make sense, but i honestly think they are getting their keys revoked cause the developers prob revoked them due to their comments/reviews on the game and the the devs have an attitude and dont like them.

The game is fun for 1-2 play throughs, maybe 2 hours or so total. But it needs a lot of work.#1. Lack of content, updates and content have been promised at three separate release dates, all have fallen through. Now apparently the excuse is they have to rebuild the entire game? I'd be fine if the devs would just release content  in small patches, but nothing has been released.#2. Bugs/fixes are needed, but the game never gets patched or fixed. Literally, it has never been patched. A few other early access game I play literally patch/fix or add updates/changes nearly every month.#3. The devs are HIGHLY unprofessional and will engage in dung throwing arguments on their comment threads instead of posting a mature, helpful update or comment. They will literally attempt to degrate you, insult you, and speak condescending if you express any sort of frustration towards the game needing an update or patch. I've even heard them tell someone something a long the lines, ""go ahead, return the game we don't care, but you probably can't because you have 9+hrs played."" I understand english may not be their first language and that's okay, but perhaps they should find someone, or pay someone to communicate better.#4. I purchased the game through steam, however apparently keys were being sold else where and even though the Devs were getting paid for the transaction, they were banning legitimately purchased/acquired keys because they were not purchased through Steam.#5. They will ban you if you apparently ""insult"" them on their message board, even though as I previously stated they will insult/talk down to you.I really liked this game at first, I recommended it to a friend and he bought it to play with me, but that was back in April, and since then nothing new has surfaced for it, only broken promises. I can't get behind a Dev team that insults/talks down to their customers; the people who support, and pay them. They need to understand their customers are frustrated, and feeling as though they have been ""ripped off"".I hope to be able to change this review when the game and the Devs are in a more positive state, but for now do not purchase this game."

That made our heart fell off. The night time is really really like REALLY scary especially when me and my friend Kiki walked in the forest when suddently a lightning striked into the tree few meters away. We were so scared that we just went back to the trailer as soon as possible. (Best Lightning Simulator 2017)One thing we didnt knew yet was that the bigfoot actually came to ous in the tree bridge high up at the river at night time while we were waiting because we thought it was safe but I guess it was not. The traps are good bait for bigfooy because each time he comes or activates it he will scream loud meaning that you can quickly find him where he is if you put camera and trap together. Sometimes you can caught a deer into a trap which is again the bait for bigfoot.While others are saying that they completed the game in 2 hours. Guess what? Me and my friend havent managed to kill bigfoot in 5 hours of gameplay xDOverrall its the best good looking graphics game. The day is mostly safe but you can still find bigfoot but he will not kill you or attack but run off. At night time hes more agressive and scary with those green eyes, jezus christ :DIt is worth those 16€. Now go, buy it and experience the horror with or without friend. You wont regret it. Keep it up developers! You did an amazing job and cant wait for the new update :)UPDATE: After 7 hours of play with Kiki, we finally managed to capture bigfoot, we almost had no bullets and had low health and found all missing passengers. Now bigfoot is famous in cage."

I've seen alpha's that were in better shape, but it is still playable.Quick summary:Has great graphics and a story line.The goal is obvious, capture Bigfoot.English is very poorly written, but mostly understandable.Customization is not possible with regards to gameplay. You can't change or adjust the controls.Some of the sounds are very strange, but if you're not into great sound, it shouldn't bother you.I had no problem with frame rate. All settings are on max and it ran smoothly.Bigfoot can kill you through walls. Yes, really.If you can get this on sale, it's acceptable. If you can't, wait until it's had a good coat of polish.In it's current state, I can't recommend this game. I'd keep it on your watchlist for now. Hopefully, it will get better."

After I calmed down, night struck, and we headed into the camper for the night, one of us watching the windows, one of us watching the cameras. Right as my friend said he saw something on camera 5, the roar came. My eyes became dialated and there was a chill up my spine, then the next moment I saw two green eyes run at me and try to grab at me through a window, roaring and shouting.

,Recommended,509980,33938925,Posted: 31 July,all,TheGamingShoe,"If you're looking for a decent multi-player horror experience, BIGFOOT is for you. The atmosphere of the map is generally unsettaling, especially if you were to come across a dead body by accedent. Every area of the map is open allowing for an attack on an unexpecting player at any moment. On top of the atmosphere, the map itself is much larger than I expected making a more full and more pleasing gameplay experience due to how much land you have to explore by your own witts in order to beat the game. The sound cues are on point and at times startling, and the graphics are amazingly detailed. The only complaint I have about the game is the fact that (To my knowlage) Bigfoot's attacks can't be evaded once he engages the player even if you shoot a flare. As for the encounters with bigfoot his attacks are at random and the sound cues are startling, however after a while it starts to loose it's affect on you."

It's definitely creepy and the day/night/weather is good. I wish there was clock or some form of telling time, other than in cameras (like when you're out roaming around).The atmospheric sound is excellent, however, as many others have noted, the player's footsteps seem to be a few paces behind you. There are a few jumpscareslike trees or noisy wildlife that come out of nowherethat always get me. Love it!Currently there is no way to re-map the keys, but after a little trial and error, I found there is a ""controls"" help screen when you hit ESC (Pause menu). The item/map keys are not logical as you would think, and mouse wheel does not cycle between weapons either.  Keys are: WSAD for movement, E is use/activate, Q is map, R is reload, T is place trap, X is place meat, V is place foliage, Z is cycle ammo types, H is health, F is flashlight, Right-click is night vision, and Number keys for the weapons/cameras. Also, the mouse wheel zooms in cameras, which is nice.There is no save mechanic yet, so it's an all-or-nothing challenge so far.The AI of Bigfoot seems to be really good so far.

The general summarization of what you do is you hunt bigfoot and attempt to find the missing crew and thats alot more fun than it sounds. Every game is a striaght shot no saving or reloading here just you play till you complete the story or die or play for hours on end till you need to sleep. You can ""hunt"" Bigfoot luring him with deer meat, trapping him in hidden traps and looking for him with cameras. Unfortatley all of these are hit or miss and he will be the one hunting you most likely. You start with a set amount of supplies and from there on out your on your own so use your items sparingly. Your ultimate goal is to hunt Bigfoot and trap him and yes it is indeed as hard as it sounds so goodluck, other than that your sub goal if you will is to find the missing crew and looking for the clues and piecing the story together like a striaght X-Files episode and its my favorite part of the game.Now with all that amazing stuff being said there are some problems with the game but like I said before its not finished so you cant really hold it at fault1. You cannot talk to your friends on the game. This is a big problem because its based on teamwork, Im hoping for long range communication you need walkie talkies and you could find them aswell and not just be handed them.2. Its the same thing everytime you start a level. Although the game does NOT suffer from replayability issues it could deeply benifit it to change up where a house is or where a post is things like that, maybe start with different items everytime as well?3. There is no stance other than standing up. I think the game would benifit alot from having crouching and crawling which could allow you to hide a bit easier from Bigfoot it just seems unrealistic that you would never couch or crawl in a situation like thatThats really all my big issues with it however there are alot of things that im hoping for in the future considering its not finished and there is alot to come.1. Customization options! Specifically I would like you to be able to customize your character in the way they look to be honest the base skins are kind of ugly and I think being able to edit the looks of your guy would be awsome. Another aspect iv heard talk of is perks? But I dont know where I stand on this one it seems like it COULD be good but it also might completely ruin the game, maybe a gamemode where its disabled or just none at all.2. Crafting. The game doesnt really suffer from not having crafting its one of those ideas that might be cool but the ability to build a camp fire and basic survival things like that would be a nice touch.3. More ways to track Bigfoot. I was really excited to see tracking bullets on the table as I started and I also think its really cool he can rip them out, but thats the only way to track him I thought you could be able to find footprints or track his blood after you shot him alot like have him leave some kind of trace behind that stays for a bit.4. 4 player. This one seems so natural to have a 4 player game but its only 3 and its weird to me maybe have Bigfoots dificulty scale with how many players there are but we need 4 players. With this being said the camper could use a little more room if threes a crowd in there 4 is unimagineable5. Splitscreen. I didnt expect it to have this but its always a bounus to have split screen on a co op game if you ask me.6. Limitations. This game is super grounded well more less but you have unlimited flashlight and stamina and I think there should simply be batteries for the flashlight maybe different ones from the nightvision and have a stamina bar to recharge.7. Better AI. Although Bigfoots AI isnt bad I feel like all he does is walk around and scream I mean it definetly works but having him sore through the trees and crawl around sneakily and maybe even stalk you for awhile like a Bigfoot would would be an amazing update.8. Animation. The animation at this point is rough to say the least like guns clipping through your back and crazy jump and run animations, but its a common thing amoung games and it doesnt effect anything at all so its all good.9. Contorller support. Although not a big deal I do prefer to play with a controller and have the option to change my bindings but I personally thought the key bindings were just fine.All in All this game is DEFINETLY worth the 15.99 it costs. You get ledgitamately spooked and becuase the games are hours long you get alot of good memories while getting serious trauma from falling to simply being punched Its all part of the expirience."

But that lack of variety is shown in how you approach the game the equipment you have available to you has each its own total load amount, as there is no need to decide what equipment you take with yourself you can only approach the game in a single way. The game does have single and co-optional modes but this just causes balance problems to the game (ie cameras that can be viewed at base very useful in co-op but near useless in single player). The target is bigfoot which is also boring because as far as targets go it has as much versatility as a bear. Game looks pretty but the core idea is so boring and linear I cannot recommend.Video:https://youtu.be/0QnIRAXs6vg"

I was getting 20-38fps no matter the settings.  1080p & 1440p were peforming the same which was weird as well.  Only played 55 minutes but definitely got a feel for the game and the gameplay itself is super fun.Pros:-Awesome SUSPENSE.  I only encountered the Squatch when I least expected it and had to change my shorts after.-The tools/items used such as the CCTV and flare gun are really neat at look really good.-Will be amazing in COOPCONS:-Ran very poorly for me.-The running needs to be limited and not feel so arcady.-First Person Model needs to be completely revamped as it does no match the quality of the enviroment.-Can't bind keys yet.So basically the gameplay itself is really good except for the running and first person model as i mentioned.  And again I will be following this game to see if they improve the overall performance.  My advice is to wait for now because gambling $10-$30 for every game with promise adds up and there are just way too many games that never come through performance wise.  Good luck to the DEVS as you may have found an awesome niche market, I hope it all works out!TL;DR: Giving Positive review due to gameplay.  Bad performance."

With this feedback the developers are currently working hard on the game, if you look at the Dev News you can see they post screenshots of there work as well as little gifs and updates on there progress which is more than what most big developers do for there 5 star IGN 10/10 games.

I have 5.5 hours or so in Bigfoot all in all and it definitely does not feel like a beta to me. This game is well and truly optimised and if you're considering playing alone then i would think again. This is designed for co-op + 1. A maximum of 3 players and multiplayer will make the game much more interesting to play. many jump scares are to be had and a few objectives are set into place for you to find/achieve.Ultimately the goal here is to catch and kill bigfoot then capture him and put him the cage attached to your trailer. I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who likes horrors etc. The game has great replay value and some what addictive.You start off in the caravan and have all of your essentials to take before heading out, weapons, traps, cameras, flares etc. It's very easy to get used too and doesn't take long to understand the game mechanics.

76561198043765346,Recommended,509980,32835778,Posted: 26 June,all,BeardofSocrates ★,"This game is incredibly fun with a cooperating team of players. Taking up roles, and working out strategies put a lot of emphasis on the tiniest detail such as who should stay and man the cameras, and which two should seek out the Squatch.Survival: There is a finite amount of resources to distribute amongst your party. Between the hunters, you need to quickly establish who is preparing traps/cameras, looking for lost campers, and finding resources. There are plenty of flares, but ammo for your rifles can be quickly depleted. Unfortunately there is no looting, or trade aspect in the game. While in a way I like this for encouraging the team to work together, so everyone can defend themselves, on the other-hand it's easy for another player to horde all the ammo for themselves. Since there is no loot system, if that player dies, there is no way to retrieve anything off their corpse.Horror: Bigfoot does provide for a good jump scare. There is no safe place, and if you think you can just lock the door and hide in the camper, think again. I find the green blood out of place, but it does help when trying to track him down at night. Lighting strikes are sudden and random, so headphone users be prepared.Communication/multilayer: The fun factor is much greater amongst a group of friends than the single player can offer. The role playing, and teamwork add a real nice extra layer of depth. If you lack friends that play the game you're missing out on a good portion of the fun. Thankfully you can just set an obvious password for anyone can join your match, however this creates a whole new problem; no communication. There is no way to chat with your fellow hunters, and you're left to communicating with your tools like you're some sort of caveman. Trying to tell someone how to track the tagged Bigfoot, or help a new player find ammo is very frustrating that can be solved with a text chat system. Adding more public match support is essential for those who have trouble getting a group of friends together.Bigfoot: Again, I'm not much of a fan of the green blood, but overall I was impressed with the creatures AI. Hearing his calling roar in the distance, for the first time got me quite nervous of what was awaiting me out in the woods. Possibly adding more distant grunts, or having the squatch maybe throw something at you can help increase the early game tension imo. From the impression I got though, I'm greatly looking forward to the expansion, and I hope the team is willing to explore other North American Cryptids!"

I would like it to be different then that because with the tracker bullet you hit him once and you can then see him for like 5 minutes no matter were he goes it just doesn't make it feel as scary. We thought the game should be more about trapping bigfoot for a ending or just trying to survive as long as you can and have bigfoot be something you should try and avoid not something you chase after to win. Other then that it is a really fun game and it has some good scares."

,Recommended,509980,32839493,Posted: 26 June,all,Fryingpan,"This game is only for the most discerning of video game connoisseurs and the price at which the developers of this masterpiece are asking is an absolute steal. From the moment I opened the game and was unable to put it into fullscreen mode due to the game completely crashing I saw it as a moment where the game displayed its pure brilliance. Mere hours after I solved the fullscreen issue I was seemlessly able to connect with my dear friend Palpt. Palpt proceeded to shoot me in the face with a gun, killed me, and I was unable to respawn. The inability to respawn was a genius move by the developers to display the hardships that come with a great undertaking such as hunting Bigfoot. Obviously the developers were going for artistic realism when they made the design choice to make the flares fired from a flare gun have the brightness of the sun and light up the entire map with a sound effect equally tremendous. The task which you set out to do in this game ultimately culminates with Bigfoot himself sliding across the ground toward you, like a speedy snail, and attacking you. Without a doubt, I would highly recommend this game as it gives hours of multiplayer survival horror fun with complete realism. I love it."

With the new day to night cycle they have flooded the forest with some amazing light visuals, colour saturations that beg you to admire even with the looming threat roaming the country side.  The mechanics are simplistic yet fun, I am continually drawn back to this game to see if I can take down this legendary creature.This title won't be for everyone, but there's a good chance that you'll love this game if you have a genuine interest in Bigfoot.

It's even more fun if you have friends to play it with!What I liked about the game:Jumpscares (**** the lightning)Limited resources. If you run out, you have to find more!Exploration to find missing personsThe only area you go to right now is pretty nice!The tension when it comes night time is pretty great!I do like that you can lose your friends during an online session and have to communicate.The camera system is really neat! Especially when you can use those cameras in your camper.What I didn't like about the game:Some of the animations are awkward but hilarious (still in beta but I know will most likely be fixed)Sometimes Bigfoot shows up really early in the search. It would be great for the tension to build up more when finding him. Like maybe not have him charge at you in the first few nights. It would really hype up the search if you see him in the distance or on the cameras and you're chasing him and he's running away. As the game goes on, he starts to get aggressive. This was also something a couple friends pointed out. We found Bigfoot in one session literally in 10min and already attacked us. It didn't really build up much tension but was still scary!I wouldn't mind more spooky things to happen while playing. More so with nature. Friends and I had a blast getting scared from trees falling, lightning strikes, etc.It would be neat to see more evidence of bigfoot in spots. Like hair stuck to a tree or bush, a trail of trees torn down. Then that would be spots you would maybe set up a trap. Idk I'm just throwing out ideas :pThere wasn't much I didn't like...but I did throw in some suggestions I hope the developers look over!

Many YouTubers ask us to give free press keys for review or giveaway. Some of them cheat and sell keys through third-party shops. This is also dangerous because one key can be sold to multiple users.If we become aware of such youtuber his keys fall into the ban.We regret that ordinary users can suffer from similar fraudulent actions.The best way to get game is buying directly in steam.So if you didn't buy it through Steam, you might get banned even though they got their money and you paid for a product. Shady devs are shady.Now for the game:Neat game for about 3 playthroughs. Basic. Catch bigfoot, put him in a cage.There's not much replay value, and while it's early access, it's doing that typical EA thing where updates take FOREVER and there's really nothing to show why it took so long. I bought this game about 4 months ago (on Steam, thankfully), and haven't seen one new feature implemented. There's talk of drones and a new map with yetis, but nothing making it any more than just talk.I'd hold off on buying this game. The devs don't seem to care about their users, as this banwave shows. I'd understand if it was piracy, but this is just legit people buying the game, and getting punished for buying it from anywhere but Steam. I don't care who or what you are, if you pay for something you deserve to HAVE that something."

Playing with friends is very fun, and I would recommend doing so, as having several people is more fun and more helpful, but singleplayer is much more scary and difficult in some senses. The only complaints I have (besides graphics / audio / aniumation, because after all, it's an indei game, so I'll let that slide) is Bigfoot's behavior. He doesnt seem very aggressive, and sometimes, entire nights would go by without a single sighting with me and two friends basically begging him to attack, with bait, spread out cameras, and even shooting off rounds into nothing. The other issue is the scarcity of medkits, as when playing with three players, there's only enough for each player to maybe use one, and so once a player gets hit and doesn't have a med kit, they're kinda useless and put on permenant camera duty in fear of them takling one more hit and dying. The upcoming drones seem like they will be very helpful, and I'm looking forward to that, and I have high hopes for this game in the future."

The Jump scares in this thrilling tail about finding, killing bigfoot are just AMAZING! the fact that He hunts you at night is great as well, becasue you sure as heck can't find that dude in the the daylight, EVEN tho the game says you can.

I almost gave a thumbs up straight away, until this: to the devs, PLEASE add invert Y axis . Some of us have played that way since birth and are pilots. Its very hard for me to adequately play and immerse when there are literally no control options. Good work so far...but come on guys, its 2017, I know you can do better than this ;). (Control wise). I also totally understand that there are only 2 of you, my brother and I have solo'd stuff together before as well.I love the atmosphere of this game, I WANT to continue playing it . The music is inviting to horror lovers and the like. Albeit , my first run felt irrationally challenging, as bigfoot attacked me nearly dead about 30 seconds after night fall from my trailer (whilst still aquainting with controls).I would love to recommed this to EVERYONE, and I honestly am still spreading the word to an extent, but with extreme caution. Many of us do not play cookie cutter basic controls like everyone else. For example, I use F for action instead of E, as a standard. But I don't care about the buttons NEARLY as much as the invert Y axis ability.Regardless of this disappointing control problem, I am still playing your game and programming my brain to play standard look temporarily.In any event, I will not be buying another set of copies until controls are added to the game. Give me a reason to thumbs up, I want to! :)"

I have tried so much to play this game. I reinstalled it twice which did nothing, I reinstalled my C++ from the Microsoft website, I have even put all my settings to the lowest in the menu to see if that would help. Nothg worked. I have looked in the discussions and many people have this problem. So for the developers, please find a solution to this so I can actually play this game.

,Not Recommended,509980,31456286,Posted: 29 April,all,Deputy Tootle,"This game seemed appealing almost as if it was calling out my name. I am a big coop and horror fan (when done correctly) and I think this game lacks in both the entertainment factor and the horror portion. I bought this with a friend and believed we might have a blast and ATLEAST play for 10 hours. What we discovered within the entrails of this game was truly terrifying. The first thing we discerned was the poor framerate, I have a GTX 1080Ti and I was struggling to get a stable 60 frames. After lowering our settings to get this game look like rubbish we got onto playing. We noticed so many options on what to do; install cameras, traps, and baits to capture bigfoot and bring him home. We placed some of these around the area and faster than you can say WAAAAAA it was night time. We devised a strategy to kill that monstrosity, one would check the camera and the other would stand watch. I was the one standing watch and I did so with bravery and honor, midway through my patrol, I heard a loud growl and I saw this great and ominous creature run towards me. I, of course, shot at him and when both of my shots landed he ran away like a coward! I instantly stopped being afraid as I knew how easy it would be to scare him off. When it turned into the day the fool came back and my friend shot him with a tracking dart as we thought how much of a neat feature that was and we ran after him. We spent near thirty minutes going after him and it was just a dull game of cat and mouse. After he stopped he would get spooked by our near presence and we kept rushing after him. To conclude this long review off I will just say this; The game looks pretty extensive but it's actually really linear and monotonous. If we got bored in 40 minutes imagine the boredom of playing for hours trying to chip at his high health bar. The game is really bad and you should wait to get out of early access before buying this sad excuse of a game that is cowering behind games such as slender and the rake.5/10"

Not exactly impressed by the graphical aspects of the game (It does have some really washed out colors. Even at 2560 x 1440 Max), I ventured onto the tranquil woods in search of this 'BigFoot' they called it.I only walked a few meters away and placed a trap, covered it with leaves (I have not even a clue how BIgFoot could not have seen it, as only around 6 leves are placed randomly on it.) and put some meat in, placed a camera then walked bag to the homestead. Further on after about five minutes of starting it was night time, so I sat watching this camera for two minutes until I saw BigFoot and panicked. I went of the camera only to then be greeted with BigFoot at a window somehow hitting me whilst I am on the other side. Yep, wall hitting is a feature now.Then I shot him for him to just run away slowly. He came to the trap a few 4 minutes later and I find he is just standing there with his hands in a position to say ""I'm just warming my hands up on metal, don't mind me here"", so I don't know if he got caught or not as he was a few good inches away from the trap, despite it having clsed and he not having legs? No legs, you heard right.I walked out and shot him around 30 times with bullets then I just strapped him to the sled and finished the game, all in 20 minutes, Nothing else to do as all the tourists are dead already...PLEASE, FOR THE £11 YOU SPEND ON IT YOU GET 20ish MINUTES OF GAMEPLAY. YOU MAY AS WELL CALL IT ""CAMERA WATCHING SIMULATOR 2017 - GUN EDITION"" FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIMES I SAW BIG FOOT (Twice...).

I love the concept and have been waiting for a game like this for a long time. There are a few suggestions I would like to make concerning when you die, I think that you should be able to respond but you make it difficult to do so. For example ether make it to where you respond after every night cycle, or make it to where you can find the lost people alive before bigfoot gets to them and after one character dies one of the lost people take over, and ether way you have to find your first body to get your equipment back. That is my suggestion otherwise the only problem I have with the game is that the volume in the options menu doesn't work. Thanks for making the game."

It's a it rough around the edges, and it's not exactly polished but it's still a pretty game! There we misspellings EVERYWHERE but that's no big deal. I'll try not to ruin too much for you, but there were a few times we were absolutely scared. I hope they keep working on it, and maybe adding a bit more creep factor. After a while, you start to recognize the patterns and it gets a bit boring at that point. That being said, we still enjoyed it.I do have gameplay of it on youtube.

The ****** lightnings are very scary. I cried very often when a lighting came throuhgt. I recommend to turn out the lights. Then it is a better atmosphere. The atmosphere of the game ist very very very good. You feel with the Characters and you feel like you are in the forest. It is really realistic and ripe for an early access game. I like it very much. The announced Update in 1 or 2 month promise really cool new features. Very nice. Thanks to the CyberLight Team for this really great game. Hope you update it really more.

76561198054981833,Recommended,509980,30642399,Posted: 20 March,all,baconbutty007,"The game as it stands (20/03/17) is pretty basic but is fun, looks amazing and has bags of the Pacific Northwest (aka bigfoot country) atmosphere. There isn't that much to do, other than set up cameras and traps and then either walk around with a gun or watch the cameras for signs of bigfoot. There are also deer, which you can shoot and leave traps by. So, it's fairly basic, but it's already great for just switching on when you want to switch off. The woodland (and lake) setting is simply beautiful to explore (the effects are perfect) and it has a full night and day cycle.Like the rest of the game, the Bigfoot is fairly basic at present. He looks great and is well animated. There seems to be little strategy involved, though, other than that he turns up randomly (mainly at night) and tries to attack you. A hit from your gun sends him running away again and even if he gets you it doesn't do much damage, he hits you once then legs it, so it is actually fairly easy to win.One thing the game could definitley improve on is the sound (IMO). At present, bigfoot has a limited series of roars that sound wrong somehow (muffled?) and make it easy to tell when he is about to attack. After an initial 20 mins, till he first attacked, I was fairly nervous but once I realised he wasn't much of a threat (and I'd get ample warning before he attacked) the fear factor vanished. I'd love it if there were sounds like in the film Willow Creek (twigs snapping, distant log beating--getting closer, those weird chirping sounds and rocks being thrown at you etc. In addition, it would be better if Bigfoot were much stealthier and stalked you, attacking suddenly making the whole experience much more intense.So, as it stands, a little like walking around a beautiful set with the occasional shootout. I hope it continues developing as it does as it has the potential to be perfect. It's already worth buying if you like the Bigfoot myth, with a little more strategy and more intense gameplay it will be very good indeed."

I put traps all around the map put some camaras in front of them and i waited. ten minutes later i hear this horrible scream so i check my camaras. The first i see is some skinny black thing's♥♥♥♥♥right at the camara. Of course it was bigfoot then he looked at my camara and sprinted away. Like in reasonble person I want to follow him, so I went to the scene of the scream. When i got there the meat was gone and the trap triggered, but bigfoot was no where in sight. In frustration I set back up the trap and headed back to my camper. Then i heard another scream, so i turned straight towards the sound. When I arrived at the scene he was gone again same with the meat, so i reset the trap, I decided that i should go look for him. i was walking around for about 5 minutes when i found a mangled corpse on the ground and later another one. Then there was the scream again but closer than before. I rushed towards the scream but was once again met with the same results. I then decided it was time to give up, i hadn't seen bigfoot for about 45 mins. Then out from the bushes he leaped past me I pulled out my gun and shot him in the back. I followed him until i heard another scream and thats where i found him pasted out from pain. Digging into his leg was my trap. ( so to sum this all up i only saw him twice once on camara and once in person and he lost most of his health to traps, all in all its a good game i just never really saw him)"
,Recommended,509980,30629700,Posted: 19 March,all,jacobshellhorn,"Im liking it so far but there is still work to be done to this game of course, i believe different kinds of weapons should be added to the game, would be cool if u could add more random places like small shacks, caves, able to build like tree stands, more tracking devices, of course bigger areas,  etc...., more cameras with better night vison, Big foot should not be about to reach in the camper if the door is shut, Love it when the camper does move when he runs into it. If big foot is wounded he should move slower. Traps should be able to hold big foot for at least 5 sec after going off. Able to change the style of the camper and the truck. Different Levels of how strong and Smart bigfoot gets that would be awesome!!! maybe a lil bit more random Animals would be cool. Maybe some body armor would be nice, protecting you from those bigfoot blows. More Medic supplies. Different seasons would be cool, i saw the snow one coming soon that looks awesome.  Sounds are great but the thunder in the game doesnt sound long enough when it goes off, it sounds like it get cut off towards the end needs work. Different ""monsters"" would be awesome to hunt down, and the tools on how to defeat them.This game is scary, but yet its really fun too. i love how bigfoot chases u down and then runs away. that is pretty sweet.Overall this game is pretty awesome Keep up the good work just hope this game gets the attention it deserves."

You're set in a rather large area of a remote forest looking for and trying to capture Bigfoot using tools such as flare guns, rifles, cameras and bear traps.  The graphics are decent for an indie game and on my pc (AMD 8320 , 16 GB ram, Gforce GTX 1060 6GB) runs very well.   The developers have done a great job setting the atmosphere and generating some good scares.  It takes a bit of patience and luck to defeat the bigfoot but overall isn't that hard even solo.  The devs are promising a big update to increase replay and add some complexity.  Given what they've accomplished so far there is a lot of promise.

,Not Recommended,509980,30989788,Posted: 6 April,all,Im Hacking,"I have previously made a review saying this game is one of the best games i have played all year. while this is true the joy was short lived. The problem with this game is not the game itself however it is the developers. Since releasing this game they have added little to no content to the game. In my honest opinion they have released this game too soon because they are not adding thing. I know this game is early acess but it does not mean they should wait 6-8 months to add content. What they should do is roll updates out periodically. Instead they are trying to COMPLETELY change the visuals and gameplay. Since this game is going to be completely different why was it released in the first place. Now don't get me wrong i am deeply excited for the update (which should of came out this month) but i'm and tired of the wait. What happens if they release this ""MASSIVE"" update and there end up being huge amount of bugs? will they wait another 6 months to fix them? From the pictures they have posted the new map and game togethor look AMAZING. they say they have added wolves and 40 new animations for bigfoot. Yet they dont want to release all of it yet cause they have more to add. Now i Believe this updated may even be worth the wait, but i think that the amount of changes mean they werent as pleased with the original game and in fact should have never released it this early. some people can't even get on the gamed and i dont even know if they have fixed that. I payed 15 dollars for a game that is currently worth 5 (however i didnt nor do i now really mind spending it) and they are trying to turn it into one worth 45. With NO content added in 3-6 months, don't really remember when this game came out tbh just remember waiting for the INFAMOUS update, who is to say they wont finish what they are doing now and have another idea for the game and postpone the update another 4 months. This is worse than delaying the game itself because we are stuck with an unfinished game that was played a total of 5 hours for most people and is gathering dust in our steam librarys. Stop making promises and just do whjat you are gonna do. im gonna have to thumbs down because even though the game is fun people will soon realise the developers are spewing out false flags."

,Recommended,509980,32164655,Posted: 3 June,all,Blaze - Neptune Waifu,"I played this game with my horror-buddy. I was streaming the whole game and i have to say, it is quite fun to play it coop. While we continued throughout the game we came along a few bugs and glitches. These bugs and glitches did not impact our game and were only about some textures. To keep this rather short for people who are not sure if they want to buy it or not:We only played this game coop. That means we can not tell the difference between coop and singleplayer. But i assume singleplayer is by far scarier than playing with friends, but also not as much fun.First of all:Would i recommend buying it? - If you have a friend to play it with, definitely yes. If you are going to play it alone, better look at some video footage first or play with strangers online (there are quite a few people mostly at all time).Ratings:Horror: 6/10Atmosphere: 8/10Bigfoot: 8/10Lightning and thunder: 11/10Controls: 6/10Horror:It was very scary at the beginning. Not only the Bigfoot, but also, and I would not call this a spoiler because it happens randomly in the game, lightning strikes and thunder sounds. The atmosphere was very scary as we started to play. But it gets more comfortable when you know all the mechanics in the game and how to use them.Atmosphere:Scary atmosphere even at daytime. The nighttime can be horrifying with all the sounds you hear while walking through the woods.Bigfoot:Good model, fitting sounds. Only the AI is something to work on.Lightning and thunder:Yes...Controls:The controls are simple, but also the usage. What bothers me the most is the missing crouch function.Overall:My rating: 7/10My friend: 8/10Playtime until we beat the game for the first time: ~4 hours.Replayable: Worth playing after you finished it, but probably not as much fun."

I am going to play the game this weekend and keep playing it until I get bigfoot in the cage,  I do not know how easy it will be just me playing but I will find out.   I made a mistake in my earlier review, I thought I killed bigfoot and the game ended before I could do anything, when in fact I was the one who died  in the game.  I thought I saw bigfoot go down on the ground.  So I will keep plugging away at bigfoot until he goes down."

HUGE downside, you can't drop items your friends might need and you cannot get any of their items if they die. Bigfoot should run away from you if you put enough damage into him. He wont stop till he gets a hit off on you, which kinda sucks. That or add about 3 more medkits into the map. Four players would also be a huge improvement. Also the jumping animation is super silly. Keep it."

,Recommended,509980,30365869,Posted: 6 March,all,smallp0x,"With little direction aside from ""Find bigfoot and put him in a cage"", it took some trial and error before I finally felt confident in how to play this game (I never played Rake). I did some co-op with a buddy and had a blast, although for a $16 pricetag I expected a little more. I understand this is early access, and look forward to what they have in store for the future... but at this time I'd only comfortably pay $4.99 for this title.The gameplay was smooth and UE4 looks great; Bigfoot definately scared the everliving sh*t out of me during our first encounter... but after you gather an understanding of the mechanics, the fear level plummets. I was however pleasantly surprised to see there were some other opportunities for pants sh*tting other than just sasquatch. But I'll leave those for the player to discover.Overall I had a great time playing with friends, but if I were solo I'd probably shy away from this. If you ever played Rake, you'll feel right at home. It should be noted that the ""matchmaking/invite friend"" system was much easier than I expected. You DO NOT have to use any kind of 3rd party application or anything of that nature to host a server and invite a friend. MP supports up to 3 players as well. For the most part it's all plug and play.I'd reccommend this game for some quick scares with a friend if you're both online with a day off.For those interested, there's a 13 minute clip of gameplay below. This DOES reveal Bigfoot AND the end of the game, so keep that in mind if you proceed. It took me about an hour and 45 minutes to complete. Of course there is also plenty of replay value, and the devs are currently working on alternate locations. One of which looks to be a winter climate.

I managaed to hunt that hairy B@#$%*! in the daylight and he ran like a sally. All the will catching rounds in his back. Since it is beta I know there is going to be some issues. The biggest is the Co/Op. If your going to have Co/Op have more and a couple dozen servers show up, or better yet a search function. I tried to get into one of my freinds game and never seen them, only the same same servers over and over. I mean come on this is steam and we know almost all of us play these Co/Ops with steam friends. I mean you can't even invite someone. How lame is that? Still it's a beta game so ""hopefully"" there will be some improvments. As a hunter I can not downplay the lever action. But, i would like something with more knockdown power, like say a 458 Socom or a 458 Win Mag. Also why no 4 player???? Kinda off being a 3 player when almost all games in Co/Op are 2 or 4. Supplies are finite and yea that  makes since. But if Bigfoot is killing people I would imagaing ammo would be in greater supply. Also if there are 3 hunters should be 3 guns and supplies for 3 people. Will I keep playing it yes, and if it gets better then all the better. If the Co/Op dose not improve then I will have to drop it."

Running and screaming while bigfoot was chasing us and then turning on him and pumping him full of shotgun lead and a tracking bullet. Absolutely amazing fun for a few hours worth the money especially if they keep pumping out content for the game!!
,Recommended,509980,31068933,Posted: 10 April,all,Spud,"Finding Bigfoot ReviewGameplay:Gameplay wise this game is amazing, as soon as you enter the game you get a feeling of enthusiasm to go and explore, finding big foots the goal but exploring is the first priority. You can look around, find weapons and get scareds-h-i-t-lessby Deer/Elk wandering the forest. The moment night hits you feel unsafe, wanting to get to a position you are comfortable in, similer to slender since you know hes coming just not when or where. You proceed to walk around at night hoping to not run into him, but the roars getting closer. Making you just not want to keep moving, the lightning continues to shock you (Quite literally) and the awaiting moment of a tree to collapse on top of you all this while there is still one goal, finding big foot.This experience is best had with multiple people as you can plan out your moves and not feel so scared to attack bigfoot, with this aspect bigfoot becomes the hunted, only here and there for the occasional jumpscare. A good jumpscare at that though. He tends to hit you once then run away which can be used to cheese him making the game all calculated, every move you do will progress you towards your end goal. But it all seems to easy at the end of it, just time it all right bait him out and abuse it to let you win.In my eyes this is an amazing start for an indie game as it completely projects the same ambience as outlast, making you scared of everything, questioning every bush you see in the distance.ProsAs soon as the game starts you are instantly immersed in the role of which you are hunting this beast.The ambience is something which controls how you feel at certain point, this game does that perfectly.Amazing visuals with all the foliage making you not sure what you see in the distanceThe Fact that you feel safe yet bigfoot still gets you, especially in the trailer, when he first attacked that I had no clue what to do.This game doesnt hold your hand and help you, youre just dropped in the trailer and what you do is up to youAudio ques make this game, the roars tell you which direction he is, you can either try kill him or just ignore that direction if you dont feel confident enough to fight him.ConsNot enough threats once you know how ole bigfoot works you can cheese him, making the game boring.Barely any replayability as once you know what to do and what happens there isnt any goal, i get the fun part of it but i can only see myself playing it 2-3 times after completing it.Needed to replace pants more than once.Improvements:Bigger map: After you view everything you seem to be playing cat and mouse, just trying to catch up with the monster, more adventure to the mix will add a new level of questioning, it would also make the game less scary as he has a wider area to be to find him. so i can kind of get thatLore: at this point in time there is no story i dont believe behind this (Not so bad) but its what drives us as a player, reasons behind why were doing this like if we're looking for a family member who we find to be mauled by bigfoot then i can understand why we are doing all of this but thats just me.MORE AMMO, not to sound rude but the ammo is so scarce in the game and you cant even drop it so my mate picked it all up and couldnt share it to us making 2/3 people worthless. Respawns of ammo would be amazing.Note: I will be changing this every now and then based on their updates.Thanks for reading!"

It very boring for the 2 hours we played it because there was barely any action and we had already found all of the tourists.  Idk, maybe the game wasn't for us.  I recommend that others play it though because it had a lot of potential."

My friend and I bought it today and were excited to play, but it just gets boring after 15 minutes. Kind of wished I saved my $16 on this game but it also kind of fun, there is definitly room for improvement."

Yet right now, unless its on sale or you have alot of money wait until its fully out or it has more features like more maps or drones."

I use a cheap wireless mouse that has never had problems with any game before this one, but the controls were so jenky I spent 10 minutes attempting to centre on the night vision goggles to take them and with the tiniest millimetre movement of my mouse my characters staring at the objectives :/Until then, completely unplayable for me. Do have some hope since this is early access and hopefully the feedback is received."

I have not been playing too much as you can see and that is because i have been wating for the update. I don´t have a problem with wating but when the developers constantly changes the release date of the update (I think they have done that more than three times now) I get really tierd and in the end mad. I am fine with you guys working on the game but please don´t say hi before you cross the bridge. You make false promises which at least i do not like. So instead say nothing when the update is released unless you actually know the exact release date!I like this game, so please continue the development but until the next update comes out i can not recommend buying it.."

,Recommended,509980,32495268,Posted: 16 June,all,Minerkey Development,"*note: all the people complaining about it crashing, I have a possible explaination at the bottom*Though I have yet to play the game myself (due to the game crashing on the menu screen) I can't properly review it the way I'd like to. BUT from what I've seen by many youtubers, the game looks very interesting and seems to be a lot of fun, unlike 'The Rake' which was cancelled in a very un-polished state.The game looks visually appealing and rather nice, the lighting is extremely well done, as well as the models and textures, with high poly models with proper hair physics and high-res textures giving off a somewhat realistic feel to the game.Some downsides about the current state (in my opinion) are:1: the game's menus are uninteresting in it's released state, with no real representation of what the game is like, I mean sure, there's a forest in t he background, but even 'The Rake' had an interesting, nice looking menu. But the devs appear to be changing the menu right now anyway.2: current character models are all the same, with 'interesting' walking animations that look rather odd, they look like some of my very first walk cycles right now. The character models are well done, but need more variation for multiplayer games, so the players aren't all clones of each other. This is also being fixed.3: the current price for the game $15.99 USD, around $16. For the quality of the game so far, I don't believe this price is low enough for the state of the game, yes there is lots of stuff being added as we speak, but at least $10.00 at the most, I've told my friends (who also have seen the game, but haven't bought it) about the game and what is being added, I then told them the price and most of them thought it was too much money right now. Like I said, $10 at least, it would probably get more customers if it had a lower price.Overall I think it's a nice game, and there's soo much to be added in the next version. But I'd wait until more content is added (when the next update is released). There'll be a nicer menu, revamped Bigfoot AI, another level, remote control drones, other animals like wolves and deers (even racoons) and probably much more, and Nvidia hairworks is getting dumped so more people can play the game at a more consistant framerate. Once I can play the game I'll be updating my review.Now for all you people who can't get the game to run past the loading screen (me included) I think I have some idea of why. Nvidia hairworks is an advanced software.. A REALLY advanced software, it was even used in games like Witcher 3. However, it is not well optimized for low-quality PCs and/or laptops. When the loading screen is done loading the game shows up, and instantly loads in Bigfoot, then applies Nvidia hairworks to him, causing lower end PCs to crash, due to the almost zero optimization of hairworks, your laptop can't handle Bigfoot being loaded in along with the hair he uses, so it crashes. This also explains why you can hear the game sounds before it crashes: it loads the game, then Bigfoot, then crashes because it can't handle it.I have emailed the Devs (cyberlight) about this and am awaiting a reply. Until then, I'd recommend not downvoting the game constantly because it crashes for you, the next update is removing Nvidia hairworks, due to poor optimization ok?"
