It's certainly obvious they're using the forward renderer/MSAA because it has fantastic IQ and not the typical ugly Unreal look. Thank you, developers. MSAA makes a MASSIVE difference!- Seems like it has a ton of replayability (if you're into old school arcade games). Gut instinct says it has a high skill level to it. Hopefully my playtime will gradually grow into the hours, because as I write this, it's my intention to replay this quite a lot. It's a world I want to re-visit. It's a good antidote to the ugliness of the real world.- Just feel this has a polish that's rarely seen in VR. The only VR exclusive game I feel personally touches it in this area is ""The Lab""."

The game is very polished, the animation of the boss is very nice, the environments are splendid.But don't your hopes too high:  it remains a rail shooter, and thus suffers from all the associated problems if you mix it in VR, especially motion sickness which comes quite fast but your mileage may vary.There's also only kind of monster for the moment, but I hope to see some variety later on.Finally a few suggestions for the team:- Find something else to represent your aim, because most of the time I can't tell the difference between the monsters and the aim thing. Maybe add a kind of line/laser from the controller to the target so that you're not lost when there's action- Reduce the FOV by vignetting the screen when you move fast to avoid sickness (or reduce it once for all by adding a kind of helmet, like of you were looking from within a scaphander)- Materialize the path better: it will help the player to anticipate the movement and prepare for turns, avoing sickness.Ordinary I would ask for a refound, 10 euros isn't cheap especially to get sick, but I want to show support to you guys because we need more solid games and studios like yours on this platform.GG !"

You have 2 controllers with different colors, your job is to point those controllers that is opposite of the color. Since the mechanic is simple but somewhat hard to master, you'll want to replay the levels to get a higher score so there's replayability in this game.Graphics is pretty amazing and the performance is pretty nice and it doesn't lag when explosions(hitting enemies) happen near you compared to other VR games. Managed to do Ultra with 1.5SS with a 980ti. Soundtrack is pretty ok, if I don't have anything to complain about it then it's good.I hope they add more levels especially for $10, 4 levels is not really worth it for the gameplay time."

I thought I'd do well after my 'Normal' run, but 'Hard' is a whole new ballgame in terms of skill!Is this game worth $10?I think it is- if not for the skill-based gameplay and excellent visuals, then to support more big name devs like Ninja Theory experimenting with VR."
,Recommended,510290,25733793,"Posted: 27 September, 2016",all,veri,"So I'll start out with the bad - this is a short game, and you could potentially play through all the levels in a half an hour or so.The good?a)  This is one of the best VR games you can get right now.  It's a rail shooter with ikaruga like shooting controls, where you lock onto enemies of the opposite color instead of the whole aim/shoot/reload thing.b)  The graphics are a class above virtually everything else in VR right now.  It looks amazing.If I were HTC I'd make this a pack-in game."
,Recommended,510290,25815958,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,Revel8tion,"It's fun, but the music and pacing is slow and boring, therefore it comes across as blasé.  I really like the concept between fire and ice but it comes across as somewhat boring.  I will be keeping it and playing from time to time but really wish the developer would amp up the music and the excitement."

76561197995317762,Recommended,510290,25716791,"Posted: 26 September, 2016",all,LooseButthole,I didn't experience much motion sickness just a little disorientation - you are not going nearly as fast as vr rollar coasters and focusing on the enemies helps somehow. The graphics and gameplay are dope. The Ikaruga inspired ice and fire weapons are very ideal for two motion controllers in VR. I think the main problem is they need a lot more content (5 levels one enemy one boss?) and that doesn't look like it's going to happen seeing as it's fully released.. I'd gladly pay 3-5$ for an experience like this bt $10 is just too high.Recommend getting on sale. Despite my complaints it's too cool to not recommend.
,Recommended,510290,25794430,"Posted: 30 September, 2016",all,RED-FROG,"Yes.And this is exactly one of the best VR titles I've seen on the HTC Vive.Even though it's an arcade game and there is not thaaat much to it. But what it does, is great.This game is not rich in content nor does it offer a lot of control in the game itself, however the game design, the game mechanics and the reward system is brilliant. The feeling to ""be there"" is so relaxing and statisfying.It was difficult to understand what the game was all about and how THAT could even be good. Especially by looking the trailers it looked rather boring.On a monitor with 2D mouse controls it would be dull. But in VR it looks and feels absolutely fantastic. The controls are highly precise and it is such a challenge to really get it right, to get the combos right, to memorize the levels and enemies a little and reach high scores.Now what's missing would be even crazier worlds that could dynamically/organically change, leave you in a strom or rain.Highly polished and well thought out!"

That was a lot of fun, esp if you had a 3d TV and a playstation.  This games borrows a ton from it.  I still hope that Eden gets ported, but this is the next best thing.  Visually, one of the best VR offerings"

,Recommended,510290,26046977,"Posted: 15 October, 2016",all,M0rdresh,"DEXED has a lot going for it, awesome art direction and the gameplay is quite fun. You basically have two 'guns', ice and fire and have to target enemies according to the elements. Fire beats ice mobs, ice beats fire mobs. I cannot stress enough how nice the art is in this game, the environments are breathtaking and easy on the mind and not motion sickness inducing.As with a lot of VR games the game is rather short, but this game has a lot of replayability and the pricing is fair and half that of many other games that are more tech demos over this polished product.I do recommend this game because it does not entirely focus on the novelty of VR but offers an interesting take on gameplay and what the Vive controllers can do."
,Not Recommended,510290,32783140,Posted: 25 June,all,Rafport,"A good idea, with an averagely polished graphics (not very detailed but competent, and with two dominant colors) and an on rail shooting gameplay with an Ikaruga kind of targeting.The only huge problem is the longevity: 20 minutes to beat all levels and the only boss. I knew before about the lenght, so my expectations about contents were very low, but Dexted is even shorter and easier than my worst fears. Replayability is just playing for best scores on leaderboards, and an arcade mode than (after 10 seconds of enthusiasm, finally some challenge!) is just a wave shooter in a closed arena."

It didn't hook me though.  Personally I'd like a meteos style game in vr.  Or a fully fledged out version of the space shooter in The Lab."
,Not Recommended,510290,25839693,"Posted: 3 October, 2016",all,Spank0,"Meh.. Its an on the rails shooter, blue gun shoots red objects, red gun shoots blue objects... This kind of thing was fun in the 90's for some people, but it doesnt work for me. Technically its solid, graphics are kind of impressive. But its overpriced for its content and wont keep you entertained for long, just look at everyones play times. Would recommend if price was lower."

,Recommended,510290,31758536,Posted: 14 May,all,Diversian,"I payed for this, and it's not satisfying yet. I feel like I paid too much if the Dev doesn't return. Looking at the last ""news"" update, it was in December and touch controllers were added (and maybe a world). Each level is a few minutes long, and while they look amazing it was almost too relaxing to be named something pertaining to having a dexterity requirement.Today, it's a fantastic game to get on sale or to support the developer. ""Tomorrow"", it will be a great game to get period.Pros- Beautiful- Runs extremely well at Ultra settings on my 1070 & AMD 8350- Simple concept, difficult to perfect- There's an ""arcade"" mode which adds a nice change of paceCons- Low replay value- While it's gorgeous, it's not very exciting- Haven't seen any updates posted in 5 monthsNeutral- Depending on your perception of money's value, this might be a great buy at $10, for me I would have said with the current content $3 if I'm being honest with myselfAfter one play through of all levels starting on Normal (as opposed to easy or hard), I just didn't want to go back and considered asking for a refund... then I thought, I don't get refunds because I'm an early adopter and this person did amazing work. In fact, I'm eager to have them add more content so that I can come back to this game. There needs to be a hook, something that adds infinite replayability. I'm thinking if the dev added the ability to play your own music, and have it procedurally generated and perhaps 10 more levels, this would be a game to infinitely."

I gave it 30 minutes, and it just seems really boring to us. That is just my opinion, and this seems like a game one might play on a touch screen tablet or phone. I do not see this as a VR central game, but a phone port. Not bad in VR if you like those sort of games. I just expected something more than that from all the positive reviews."
