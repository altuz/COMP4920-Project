,Not Recommended,510510,32401232,Posted: 13 June,all,WehrabooϟϟPure,"I don't write reviews but this is a special occasion.So I decided to play WWE 2K16 with my friends one day. Was greated with a error message saying that the servers were shut down. On a year old game. 1 year.Whatever, I suppose now will be a better time than ever to buy 2K17, right? I mean, at least in that game they have entrances.What a fatal mistake. I opened up the game and wanted to unlock all the characters instantly because I only enjoy playing the WWF/Attitude era wrestlers and it came to my attention that I have to pay $4.99 to unlock all of the characters that were already in the game. Keep in mind that this feature was completely free in 2K16, you just went to the options and click ""unlock all"".I bought it, whatever. Now that I have all of these wrestlers (questioning why they removed several from the previous title) I decided to check out the CAW's, OR ""create a wrestler"". I enjoy this feature because it alows you to download wrestlers that were created by other people and shared for anybody to download. But alas, this was a major dissapointment. You need to have all of the compatable DLC to download each wrestler if they use items from the DLC packs, so you basically are forced to donwload all of this overpriced DLC (like 10 dollars for a few wrestlers wtf)....Okay, I'll deal with all these faults because it is the only way for my friends to play together. We started a private game and we began to fight. The game was blasting my ears and I paused the game to lower the volume and turn off the god awful commentary but the pause menu only had an input and a leave option. So I had to quit.We started another match and wrestled for about 2 minutes until we realized that we were not seeing the same things on eachothers screen. I'm guessing that the game got desynced or something. I immediatley quit the game and requested a refund because it not only ran poorly, but didn't even work at all.I payed 50 dollars expecting WWE 2K16 but with entrances and was dissapointed somehow.A complete abomination to the wrestling industry and a slap in the face to any sports entertainment fan. I would rather be an exclusive member of Vincent McMahon's ""KIss My A**"" club than play this game for another moment of my life."

And here, as someone who has played since SmackDown! vs RAW 2009, is my review.GameplayThe gameplay has improved somewhat since 2k15 (haven't played 16), and the moves are sold much better by the wrestlers than before. But still there's some buggy stuff going around. I had this match with John Cena vs Daniel Bryan and somehow it became Bryan vs Tyson Kidd with me as Cena just running around not able to pin one of the two. Also some moves are still glitchy, but besides those bugs, the gameplay is rather good.GraphicsI understand that you need a good pc for this, but as someone who can play GTA V on High/Ultra settings on stable 60-70 fps, Dying Light on High or Mirror's Edge Catalyst on High without a single stutter, I'm pretty dissapointed that this game just can't run properly on my rig on High settings. And even when I have adjusted the graphics so that it runs on 60 fps, it still doesn't feel like 60 fps sometimes. Also the fact that the fps kinda drops outside the rings pretty bad.RosterRoster is good, without DLC's aswell. Creating CAW's is fun, but I miss a lot of NORMAL hairstyles and stuff we had before. Also the body art has been minimalized a lot.UniverseBetter and worse than before. Nothing much to say about it.MyCareerHaven't played yet.Overall Result7,3 out of 10Recommended, but beefy PC is necessary."

This game needs so much work . The controls are great , you'll get used to them in like 5 minutes or so . The announcers are so repetitive , they make my ears bleed . Also , the career mode needs a LOT of work and the developers should work on a new approach because this mode clearly is NOT doing a good job . It's a bit buggy here and there . I really wished that I would reccomend this game , but no :( I sincerely hope that the developers do a much better job when they make the next WWE game ."
,Recommended,510510,29998117,Posted: 17 February,all,Marty McFly,Much Much Better Than Last Year But..........So I preorder this game and I waited this long to give this game a fair enough review so I will be going over some of the litte details I notice.A.I and Mechanics: This is where the game shines I played on Legend difficulty and the new taunt system gives you the feel of a game that has shed away from it's failed past experiments (2k15/2k16).  The A.I for example if your playing a normal 1 vs 1 match; with a Face vs Heel match and are beating the bad guy up too much. They may get out the ring grab a weapon from underneath the ring and hit you with it purposely DQ'ing themsevles from the match (Nice). The taunt system is more useful and fun to use and they brought back the wake up taunt from 2k14 (Thank You). The Charge finisher remains in the game and you are allow to perform more than 4 taunts (20 or more or so) I use xbox controller so yeah sorry I can't be more direct for you keyboard players....Matches and Modes (Offline): There is no showcase mode in this game but that is probably why the game is much better than 2k16. What I'm saying is the MyCareer mode has some new things this year like the promo system. This promo system gives you the ability to have a RPG setting in choosing your dialogue. Other modes in game like Universe mode shares this same function and have more better details like the reversal system.Online Modes 2K Tonight/WWE Live: 2K Tonight mode is much polish this year and this is the mode you would play if you want a fair match with no custom movesets or custom wrestlers. WWE Live mode is the only mode I play because of the ability to use your created wrestler and edited movesets. I like to edit my wrestlers moveset because I mostly play Universe mode on Legend difficulty and some wrestlers moves changes in real life.Random Question: Should I buy this game?Me: This game is fun but I notice the price is much higher than last years 2k16 deal. However this game release this month (February) and not in March so you have to consider that maybe the reason why so pricey.Random Question: I have a friend who bought this game and they are having problems with Framerate drops and such any ideas why?Me: I had similar problems with my game after I installed it and I have an Nvidia graphics card. I even went into my Nivida control panel settings to make sure all my games were using the Nivida card and not the standard video card and still I was experience framerate drops. So I just rebooted my pc so the game is in sync with the video card driver hope this helps.Random Question: No he tried all of that....Me: Well..... He better hope 2K patches the game up because that is mostly the reason.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*2K Games please focus on hiring voice actors for MyCareer mode and Universe mode because the promo system is a good idea but it's useless and boring after awhile reading all the $hit. Showcase mode should NOT be in the base game you should only include that mode as a DLC or integrate Showcase mode in Universe mode because we could careless about the replay value because that mode doesn't have any unless your really bored and don't have online......

That being, in MyCareer or Universe mode, whenever the show starts, it plays the unbelievably annoying 'logo' noise over and over and over. It grates on my nerves endlessly, and kills a lot of my enjoyment to the degree that I just don't want to play it anymore. Until that gets fixed, thumbs down from me."

,Not Recommended,510510,29814708,Posted: 9 February,all,venseyness,"I like 2k17. It's one of my favorite games to play a few rounds in when I go over to my friend's house who has a PS4.This is not 2k17.This is a laggy, processor hogging, crashing, unoptimised monster of a game.Now let me be clear, it's not as bad as it could be. There are parts of it that work fine. The charachter creator? Smooth as silk. The move selector? Never drops below 60. But the actual GAME? When there are two people fighting each other? That's just embarrasing.My machine can run The Witcher 3 at 50-60fps through and through at ultra settings. This doesn't BEGIN to compare to how that game looks, and I struggle to get half of the framerate I'd get on The Witcher 3.And don't fool yourself into thinking you can turn the graphics down either. When I'm at maximum graphics, everything as good as it can be, I get about 25-30FPS with lag spikes all over the place. When I turn everything down to 0, I get 28-34FPS, and the lag spikes as present as ever.I do like this game. I think the gameplay's engaging, and it's simulator-ish nature leaves the door open to great storytelling and creative ideas. But I can't reccomend it in this state, I just can't.I've played the game for 12 hours at the time of this review. I've had 11 crashes during that time. I haven't pressed the quit button once, the game always does it for me.That's just pitiful."

Community content is the one thing that makes these games worth play for more than a few weeks and when you're most important feature hasn't worked since launch in october 2016 and 2k is still yet to acknowledge the issue let alone try and fix it, instead moving on to the next years game & abandoning this one and leaving it to the community to try and dig up any fun that is held in the game."
,Not Recommended,510510,30347690,Posted: 5 March,all,Andariel Halo,"Having skipped a few years from WWE 13 to WWE 2k16, i was blown away by 16 and loved it and found lots to do.  I was extremely anxious for WWE 2k17, expecting it to be an augment for 2k16, something like what WWF No Mercy was over WWF Wrestlemania 2000.The end result is immensely dissatisfying, though.  The graphics look exactly the same to me, though there may be some improvements.  Something about the way the flesh and colors look makes them all look flat and plastic.  The sort of dis-realism of the wrestlers and their expressions from 2k16 were not at all addressed here.  The game modes are all the same from 2k16, with backstage brawling and crowd brawling finally added in, but segregated so that you can't go backstage during the course of a tables match or hell in a cell match, but only if you pick Backstage Brawl.The roster list is the same ugly mess that came with 2k16.  Current superstars are mixed in with former superstars and superstar variants, seemingly without care.  Certain superstars who would have been highly publicized for inclusion (or were highly publicized for previous years) or made something unlockable or part of a ""Legends"" pack are just there, included in the list as if they were Aidan English or Zack Ryder, with no special labeling or being included in a separate list.The DLC for new superstars is also massively underwhelming, charging 9-10 dollars for about 7 superstars total, while not bothering to add people like the current NXT champion Bobby Roode.Ultimately what killed this game for me was the lack of attention or care to details.  Simple things that could have added a bit of zest to the experience.  WWE 2k16 had this for me in the form of the wrestler taunts; certain wrestlers' taunts had them speaking out loud.The nature of NXT now is such that it has a highly devoted, energetic fanbase, and the experience of having crowds sing along with Nakamura or Bobby Roode's entrance music can be just as awesome as a match itself.  As more NXT favorites come to the main roster (like Kevin Owens, Samoa Joe, Bayley, Charlotte Flair), their fans stick with them and bring their unique reactions and chants with them.WWE 2k17 has nothing at all like that.  The crowd is dead as any other WWE game, with the exact same monotonous crowd noise triggered at the same points of an entrance.  No one sings along to Shinsuke Nakamura's music.  There are no competing chants, no half-boos and half-cheers for the likes of John Cena or AJ Styles.  No one chants ""Joe's gonna kill you"" or ""Asuka's gonna kill you"" at the start of a Samoa Joe or Asuka match.  A superstar labelled a heel is flatly booed with generic audience boos, a face is flatly cheered with generic cheers.And the multiplayer for PC is essentially DOA.  It's exactly the same double-blind matchmaking system from WWE 2k16, where you can be waiting for hours for a matchup that will never happen while being forced to ""practice"" wrestle against the computer in an empty arena.Ultimately this game reeks of mediocrity, being just another cash-grab entry in a franchise that has to put out a new game yearly.  Sometimes the cycle gets broken with a whole new game (recently like WWE 12 over the Smackdown vs Raw series), but this latest entry is stuck in the middle, being little more than some tiny changes and added features over the previous entries.For a first-time buy, or for someone who hasn't played since Smackdown vs Raw, this would be an amazing WWE game, but if you've played WWE 2k16, this is more of the same, safe and predictable."

I have not been having the crashes and glitches that others have, but if I know the steam community, I know I can expect a ton of downvotes for saying so. Sorry.For me, the game has run very smoothly with a constant 60 fps at 1080p. The matches load quickly. I feel like the balancing has been improving every year since 2K15. I'm really good at these games, and it was impossible for the AI to beat me in previous games. Now the AI actually feels like a challenge (well, sometimes anyways). I lost my very first steel cage match, which shocked the hell out me since I have not lost one since the ps3 era. But that only made me excited to keep playing. Before, I would create a character, win the championship almost instantly and never lose it. I would get so bored. Well, not with WWE 2K17.Character customization is improved in almost every area, except one. In this game, you have more hair and clothing options than we have seen in a very long time. Clothing can now be used with both genders, which is great if you want to make a woman who looks like she can actually win a fight. The downside to this is that you no longer have the advanced morphing options that you used to have. Now you pick a base body and then mix and match pre-made parts like arms, legs, torsos, etc. No more big boob dominatrix girls for me... Oh well.When the game is running smoothly, I do recommend it. However, there is no way for me to tell you what kind of experience YOU are going to have. If the game did not work for me I would be mad too. If you are thinking of getting this game, I suggest that you do as many matches as you can within the first 2 hours. Don't waste any time with character creation. If the game is going to crash, it is likely to happen during matches. This way, if the game does not work for you, you should still be able to refund it. Believe me when I say that you can spend all day creating new wrestlers."

The VC offered for buying an upgraded package was a nice surprice however the cocept that buying skills for a story mode that can be easily deleted and not refunded is terrible. It makes no sense to buy skills that can be lost and the currency cannot be returned. This is also poor due to having nothing warning you of this before spending the currency. It's as if they were just trying to screw people out from spending the VC on things that mattered instead of things that could be tested at the start of a story mode. Youre actually punished for exploring the games mecahnics and if you dont know ahead of time what you want/need you lose all the credits you spent the money on in the first place. Terrible design and because of this i cannot reccomend
,Recommended,510510,33316005,Posted: 6 July,all,Officer Cum Shot,"I'm going to try and make this an in depth review, in order to help others who are considering this game in the future.I have been waiting for this game to come on sale for quite the time now, because I had this on last gen, and like the most of us: I didn't want to pay the full price. I would constantly check Geetwoaye(tried to blur it out) but there wasn't any sort of deal. So when I finally saw it on the Steam Summer Sale, I was lucky enough to have enough in my account to buy the game.I was conflicted for the most part because I saw a lot of negative reviews, but I played 2k16 on PC as well and didn't find many problems. I decided to get the deluxe edition for 23 I believe(could have been 24) instead of the game because a few dollars more to get ALL the DLC is clearly worth it than spending the $75.In terms of the gameplay:I thought the gameplay was a lot better than 2k16. I saw gameplay on 2k15 for PC but I have no intention of buying it because 2k17 has managed to keep me entertained. There are plenty of different combinations to execute different moves and I thought it was improved and loved having more moves being added. I use a controller and the one thing I like and dislike at the same time is choosing who you go after in a match. Ex) Triple threat and having to hit R3 to change between opponents. It can be a hassle but I see why it was implemented from bugs in 2k16. There are still bugs and times when the move doesn't hit and you fall looking like an idiot but it's far less buggy than 16's. I can run the game at 45-55 FPS depending on the match, but I noticed I get the most lag from 6 man matches. It's bearable but playing an entire match at 30-40 FPS at best can be a little frustrating for many at times.PS: Love the new MITB feature and title match minigame.The announcers are Supeeeeer annoying. You get used to their catchphrases and sayings and everything is the same. I remember a lot of the phrases from 2k16 too(probably a copy/paste from 2k16 to '17)I like the new promo system, and think it's pretty neat and upgraded from 2k16's backstage promo.In terms of Graphics:If you don't have a good computer, you're probably going to have a hard time running this. Granted I can run it smoothly for the most part, all of the negative comments are probably coming from those who's computers can't run it etc. etc. There is random frame loss sometimes like when there's a double camera from being too far apart or sometimes outside the ring but it's manageable for the most part.I always enjoy the rosters. I hope the DLC would cover more or that they could release updates for updated attires, outdated entrances etc. but 2k can get a little lazy(super lazy). Considering the PC version is released many months later, you would figure that you would get A LOT more out of it than the console versions. I miss the Custom Music option from 2k15 I think (could be wrong,whoops) but everyone has the option to mod when it's released.In terms of the Universe Mode:I was iffy on this. I was used to the last few versions, but change isn't always a bad thing. I think the MITB cash in is 1 step too complicated, but isn't the worst of all cases.In terms of MyCareer Mode:I think it's a huge improvement from 2k16. I love love love the option to get extra VC from T-shirt Sales. It's an incentive to change your attire up but I don't like how you have to change it every 1-2 game weeks before your sales drop tremendously( I'm in the 22k VC per week and usually drops 1000 a week, but when I was in the 10k VC area it would drop by a few thousand).I feel that moving up the ranks is a slower process than 2k16 was. I usually move up every month, maybe 2 times per month if I am lucky. Mind you I am putting on 4-5 start matches every time, sometimes 3 if I am lazy. The authority challenges can be super ridiculous, like putting on a 5 star match and losing your title, or something I found impossible, winning by dq(harder than it seems). I wish there was an option to turn off the show logo because after hearing the into for shows around 4-5 times it starts to get pretty annoying. I don't mind the whole (buy a moveset feature), but some of them aren't even worth buying, but they suckered me in because I'm one of those people who will buy all of the VC items whether I will use it or not. It also sucks that there is no voiceover for when you are doing promo's, and sometimes if you skip the promo when you're speaking(hitting a or start for me-xbox controller), you still have to sit through and watch your character mumble words in silence.Overall, I do RECOMMEND this game, but you are going to need a good PC to run it. Like I stated in the beginning, if you have an average or small-tier computer, don't expect to get far. This game is a step up from 2k16 but the price is what gets me. The only way I saw this game being profitable on PC is if people bought it while it was on sale. We have to wait many months after it's released on console to get it on PC, and there's no incentive for the wait. Last year, 2k16 came with all DLC and this year it was seperate. Sticking with the whole all in one combo could have boosted the sales in this scenario. I mean there's nothing extra, and practically are getting the same thing in console, just have to wait longer. Not complaining, but I don't think it helps 2k.On a side note: It sucks for anyone who bought the game only and expected the DLC to be cheaper, because I noticed a lot of complaints during the summer sale that the game and Deluxe edition was on sale, but DLC's were all full price. That also doesn't help 2k because you're encouraging people NOT to buy it right away. If the right optimizations were made, I can see this game being suitable for more people.2k is slowly progressing with their games, but should be going at a faster route. The market for profit SHOULD be for PC, but instead they're letting many people down. I can still play through it, because I'm a fan of the game series, and actually love playing the games: but they need to stop being lazy and get their act together.Online matches are a hit or miss, depending on location,location,location. I once faced a guy and won 2-0 from Asia. Super laggy, but I was able to time his reversals perfectly. The best way to describe it was a slow motion match.Again, most comments that are negative are probably coming from those who CANNOT run it. I can run it, and the only problem I have is slight lag during 6 man matches. No crashes, game save corruptions etc.Overall Rating:8.0 out of 10I've been playing these games since the early Ps2 versions of Here comes the Pain! and believe their games will improve over time. They are slowly improving, but I still believe they can do a lot more in a year if they actually tried more. Instead of going above and beyond it seems they're doing the bear minimum just to get the game released. So much wasted potential, but because I've been playing for so long I can only support and hope for the best(and a lot of miracles).I recommend you get this when it is on sale, because unlike the console versions I don't believe it's worth the price. I mean 2k15 and 16 are still $50 on Steam, with it going on sale once or twice a year. I also recommend getting the deluxe edition when it is on sale, for the obvious reason of it being cheaper."

Meaning I had to- set up a universe,- recreate my CAWs (you CAN upload them so when things go sideways, they're just a download away... But still!!),- adjust the settings and game/superstar balance- deal with the random crashing...more times than I'd like.PS4 users have supposedly dealt with the save data bug when it was released, it had something to do with putting the console on sleep mode while the game is on, OR downloading things from the community.never downloaded anything after my first data corruption, and who puts their PC on sleep mode nowadays....tldr:Wait for a patch before buying this game!-------UPDATE! 2/13/17so this review has gone through some updates, but, I stand by what I initially said, and suggest waiting for a patch before buying this game. If, however, you can't wait for a patch I can perhaps offer some quick fixes to (technical) problems present in the game._________________________SAVE BUG!!!wtf is it - Deletes your progress. Universe, CAWs, Settings, Downloads, etc., *poof* gone just like that.wtf do I do:- TURNING off steam cloud sync may help.>>> Library > right click the game > Properties > Updates > uncheck the steam cloud sync box.- MANUALLY back up your saves>>> Go to steam / userdata / unique ID / 510510 (510510 is the game's steam ID)>>> Copy and save the files inside 510510 each time you exit the game, so whenever a save gets corrupted, you can easily replace them with a clean one.- UPDATE your graphics card>>> According to user Saturn (from the comments) upgrading his graphics card fixed the save issue for him.___________________________POOR PERFORMANCE EVEN ON BEAST SYSTEMS!!!wtf is it - Game runs slow no matter the graphics setting or how powerful your computer is.wtf do I do:- RUNNING the game as administrator>>> Right click the game > Properties > Local Files > Browse Local Files > Right click WWE2k17_x64.exe > Properties > Compatibility > Check 'Run program as Admin' Box > Apply > Right click .exe > Send to desktop.- CHOOSE the correct processor (I use Nvidia)>>> Launch Nvidia Control Panel > Manage 3D settings > Program Settings Tab > Select the game (If not there ADD the game) > Select correct Processor > Apply > Close_________________________RANDOM CRASHING!!!wtf is it - Game crashes randomly... lolwtf do I do:- CHANGE the game's priority>>> While in game, alt+tab out > Open Task Manager > Go to Details Tab > Right click wwe2k17 > Set priority to HIGHNOTE: Even after doing this, the game still crashes specifically when going to edit custom superstars again when you've just edited them (even after 3-4 matches).________________- In my honest opinion, it's a great game. Much more polished than 2k16, however some CHANGES, additions, and REMOVAL of certain features are... Questionable.- Also the submission minigame was changed slightly so... heads up. lol- Do I recommend the game? YES!- Should you wait for a patch? YES!- What if you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ what I think? YES!>>> Get the game, just take precautions and be aware of these issues.Cheers."

,Not Recommended,510510,30906576,Posted: 2 April,all,EricsonKO,"If you are looking for a new, fun wrestling game and you want to buy WWE 2K17, think again. WWE 2K17 is definitely not worth your time nor money.I was very dissapointed with this game. When 2K17 had came out on Steam, I was very excitied because it had some new additions and it seemed it was going to be the best WWE 2K Game to date. But, when I brought 2K17 and I played it, it got very stale within an hour. The matchups are sort of limited and the gameplay is so slow and boring. I miss it when the older games had that arcade-style type of gameplay that made it enjoyable and fun. 2K17 unfortunately does not have that. Not only that, but it makes NO sense to make PC gamers pay for all the DLC's. What kind of deal is that? So, we have to wait about 3-4 months for 2K17 to come out yet by the time it comes out, we have to pay $80.00 just for some DLC's? Wouldn't it have been more smart to just have all the DLC's come out with the game just like 2K16? I don't understand why 2K Sports would do this.While 2K17 did have some fun in it such as the creations and modes, overall, you'll get very bored of it quickly. The fun just isn't there and it's kind of lacklusture considering all the hype that came with this game. We have to pay for all of the DLC's yet you give us Goldberg for free? Horrible deal. MyCareer Mode is interesting and does seem to have some depth in it, but to be honest, you'll get very bored of it in nearly 2 days and it'll get repetitive very fast. While 2K17 may have some opitions that are exiciting and will keep you busy, overall, if you have 2K16 on Steam, I would just keep playing it and save your money until 2K18. I just hope 2K Sports will put much more effort into 2K18, but until then, I'm saving up until 2K18."

(Yet that doesn't prevent me from crashing from time to time)For those who don't typically care for a longer review, here's your short version:THE GAME WORKS, BUT YOU MAY NEED A MORE POWERFUL MACHINE THAN POSTED AND THE GAME DOES CRASH FROM TIME TO TIME.There. Now onto the actual review.I've never been one to buy these games for the online play, so I don't really know much about the 2K Live feature in the game. Sorry. Ever since SVR 2011 onwards, I've been building my own shows, rosters, arenas, titles, etc. for Universe Mode. Sure, it takes a while, but I find it more fun than to play with more of the actual roster. 2K16 had a really bad repetition feeling issue to it where (As everyone knows) Triple Threats, Fatal Four-ways, and Tag Matches were nightmares. This year a rollout feature was implemented to alleviate that problem so they're at the very least playable now. In addition to that, All matches (IMO) got three times more interesting with moving the match rating system to the rest of the game instead of just keeping inside MyCareer. The Character customization in this game is BEAUTIFUL. There's an overwhelming amount of clothing possibilities, there's body sliders, theres body customization, Everything.There's a bit more depth to show and arena customization from 2K16, as well as creating a victory. No longer do custom characters share the same animations when they win fights. On top of that, There's been more additional generic themes and animations for entrances and whatnot so when Sound Injector comes out for this game there will be so many more music slots available for us to overwrite.Overall, it is what it is: A Better 2K16. Do I think you should buy it right now? Depends. You buying it for offline or online? I'd say buy it on a sale, or get a key from♥♥♥♥♥or something. I don't think its worth the full price (Even though I paid in full for it) but if you like WWE, and have a decent rig. Go for it. Hell you even get Goldberg for free."

Besides the soundtrack which is a little bland in my opinion, the game is actually very fun. A little laggy at first, but then I lowered the graphics a tad and now it doesn't run like dog crap. As for the gameplay, it is very intruiging with many modes, and I have a controller so it was very easy to control. I can now do local co-op with my friends when they come over to my house. Now, to the cons side. Yes, it does run badly sometimes, and when the screen goes split-screen, it is HORRIBLY laggy. The career is pretty fun, even though the matchups are usually unfair,  but you can change the settings to make it easier for newer players to the WWE 2K series. Online is literally unplayable, with tons of lag and bugs that just make it terrible. The controls can be hard, even with a controller. There have been multiple times where I have gotten mad because to get on the apron, you had to first go into the ring and then tap the climb button. This was very frustrating in tag-team matches because the ref would count me out before I could get onto the apron, and without being on the apron my parter could not tag me in."

,Not Recommended,510510,31656104,Posted: 9 May,all,Ectopilot,"This is a review intended for people considering buying the game. I'm not trying to change or challenge the opinion of anyone who already owns it.TL;DR:Worth it? Unless you're just buying for career mode. On sale, definitely. See my hours.With Friends: GreatUniverse/General Manager Mode: GoodExhibition: Good. Typical. Decent amount of wrestlers although many are DLC.Career Mode: AtrociousUniverse (formerly General Manager Mode) is pretty fun if you enjoy making up scenarios or just simulating and seeing how far everyone gets in the rankings when left alone. I've ended up with Christian being the Heavyweight and US champion for 83 weeks.The Career mode, however, is the worst I've ever seen in a WWE game. Hell, Raw 2 for the Xbox back in 2003 had a much better career mode. There's absolutely no backstory - a little would be nice, but not so much to make it a completely linear story like some of the SvR games. About the only ""drama"" - you could say - that can happen are rivalries. I'll touch on this God-awful feature in a bit. The popularity system also feels like a punishment rather than a challenge - it doesn't matter if you win every single match for six months (I have), if your popularity isn't sky-high you'll never go up a single rank. I've never once been higher than rank 3 for any championship.The ranks are almost arbitrary. I've seen wrestlers with their overall in the 70s - like Callisto - shoot up to #2 or even #1 contender for the Heavyweight championship while 90s overall wrestlers like Taker maintain the same rank for months. The only (or at least most efficient in my experience) way to climb the ranks is to - as I've mentioned - keep your popularity up which is entirely separate from whether you win or lose, and to 'win' rivalries...Rivalries is this game are terrible compared to almost any other WWF/E game I've ever played in nearly twenty years. Basically, you find someone higher on the rankings than you (but not too high or you'll never get a match with them), trash-talk them or interfere in their match enough that they get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at you and you're locked in a rivalry. There is then a ""rivalry point"" system which dictates who ""wins"" the rivalry. Again, it's almost arbitrary, you can beat your rival three times but if they get you with a steel chair as you walk out to fight Daniel Bryan for the sixth week in a row - they'll win the rivalry. Again, there's no drama or even cutscenes related to this - simply a menu that lists who your current rival is. Rivalries tend to go one of two ways:1) You, for some reason, never face your rival. They win the rivalry by default, even if no-one has any rivalry points.2) You face your rival twice a week (Smackdown or Raw, plus Main Event) for a month, then at the pay-per-vier, and maybe go up one rank. There are 10 total, rank 1 being #1 contender.I could write a thesis paper on how much I dislike the Career mode, but for the sake of what little sanity I retain after so much time spent trying to decipher head from♥♥♥♥♥on this mode, I'll cut it here."

,Recommended,510510,29777631,Posted: 8 February,all,TheBigBossDan,"Not only is this one of the best WWE games in years, but it quite possibly cracks the top 5 wrestling games for me. 2K17 improves upon the groundwork laid by the past two games, and finally feels like the next-generation wrestling game we were promised in 2014 with WWE 2k15.Game runs smoothly on the highest settings with an RX 480 and an i5 6600k, though your mileage may vary. One minor complaint is that cutscenes and entrances are locked at 30fps, but it's something that can be lived with.If you were a fan of the previous two installments in the series, then WWE 2K17 is a must purchase. If you aren't a fan of the game mechanics of the previous games, then turn away now. 2K17 refines the gameplay style that was started by 2K15, but doesn't re-invent the wheel in terms of gameplay."

Even months after the PC release date, it crashes during loading and save sequences which puts me on edge because i'm worryed about losing my CAWS more than anything. Not to mention the sound glitches after the matches on Universe mode. I originally thought because I modded a few soundtracks into the game UNTIL it happened with one of the default soundtracks already in the game.When it works, I have a lot of fun with the game, but the ocassional glitches and freezing puts me on edge.

,Recommended,510510,30001437,Posted: 17 February,all,Homeschool Math Class,"As someone who's played nearly all the WWE games since 2002's ""Shut Your Mouth"", I can say that this is definitely one of the better games of the series, and definitely a step up from 2K's other wrestling endeavours.To begin, I get very few performance issues on any game I play, so that means 2K17 is no different. In 25 hours of play, the game has crashed once, and I occasionally get some FPS stutter, but other than that, and the other random glitches you get in a 2K wrestling game, I didn't have any issues in that department.Ever since I started playing wrestling games, I've always played them for the story mode. In Shut Your Mouth and Here Comes the Pain, it was the brilliant Season mode, in 2011 it was the Road to Wrestlemanias, and in 2K's next-gen videogames, it's MyCareer, their vision for the player to be able to recreate what it's like for a WWE superstar to rise up from humble beginnings and become a main eventer, all while relatively keeping kayfabe in check. MyCareer has, for the most part, been nearly exclusively what I've played in 2K's games. In 2015, it was a barebones excuse of a broken system that occasionally produced interesting feuds every ten hours. In 2016, it fixed many of those problems, although these ""fixes"" included 8 redudant matches followed by 1 semi-important match to a feud that was destined to go nowhere, along with title systems that didn't work. In 2K17, these problems are fixed. Not only do you have variety in how feuds start, end, and their length, but you can now challenge for titles much earlier, have much more control over what happens, and a re-balancing of attributes and difficulty makes these matches a genuine challenge while still being close enough and interesting enough to be riveting. You feel a genuine character progression with your CAW, through promos, championship wins, and where his spot on the card happens to land every week. Now, only occasionally do the eight matches between PPVs feel tedious, unlike 2K16, where they almost always did.My primary complaints lie in the fact that the customization suite doesn't seem to be as detailed as last years, at least for CAWs. Overall, though, there does seem to be more content within the game, including an absolutely massive roster and many different arenas. With that being said, DLC that was free last year will cost you $30 this year, as will some basic features that were available last year. The only reason I can look over this is because I think all the other items in the Season Pass are definitely worth $30, and as an avid fan of WWE, I'm willing to pay that much money for the product. Considering that it was FREE last year, however, does make me slightly sour.Considering all my experiences I've had in the 25 hours I've played so far, I'd recommend a buy. But try your best to make sure you can also buy the season pass, too. If you don't, you miss out on very valuable roster members, including Eddie Guerrero, Tye Dillinger, and the Club, along with basic functions such as editing the stats of pre-existing wrestlers. If you can get over that small detail and have enough money to spend on this game, the combination of MyCareer and a fun wrestling sim will be enough to hold you over for quite a while."

The character customization is much better this year with improved load times, but 2K really cut down on the ability to edit your character's body type. It forces a somewhat realistic body type on your custom superstar, so no characters where their hips are so thin it's almost invisible. Career mode is also very lackluster. It seems like the game is just rehashing last year's career mode and just adding features that really don't do much, such as selling T-Shirts. The promo engine is also pretty uninspiring.The gameplay and fighting mechanics are pretty much the same as 2K16. It's good, and I've grown familiar with it. I do appreciate how all matches are rated on a five-star scale now though, as it encourages me to have a good match with different moves and spots instead of just trying to get the win as fast as possible,The saving grace (for me, not sure about others) is the universe mode. I never played universe on the other games (I have WWE '12, WWE 2K14, WWE 2K16, and WWE 2K17) but this year I actually got to sink my teeth into having a full fledged Universe. I found it a lot more fun when I use my own custom characters and characters that my friends made, as opposed to just using the in-game superstars. I had my very own brand split, and I've had a blast playing it. The rivalries and cutscenes can become subpar and repetitive in its execution, but if you have a good imagination you can get over that.Overall, get this game if you like to fool around and create your own stories. Get something else if you are looking for a serious fighting game/simulator."

,Recommended,510510,29775956,Posted: 7 February,all,ZeroTacTiX,"-WWE 2k16 improved and fixed.-Full 21:9 ultrawide support unlike 2k16. Some menus and loading screens are 16:9 but even entrances are 21:9 which is great.- Major con : Many classic WWE superstars can't be unlocked unless you buy a dlc. But the roster in the game is big enough that I think it's fine, but I won't be paying for the dlcs. The game has Bret Hart, Macho Man, Earthquake, Ultimate warrior, Ted Dibiase, Vader, Diesel, Scot Hall, Andre and so many other classic wresters too but a few that are missing are : Hulk Hogan, Kurt Angle, and another major newtimer : Batista. While Batista can be downloaded from Custom Creations, some of the others are blocked behind dlcs which is a shame.-Triple Threat match type greatly improved by having a ""rollout system"" whereby the injured guy rolls out of the ring, and if needed, can get back in when he's up, at a cost, or stay outside longer so he'll receieve a buff. This makes the matches more interesting and more real WWE like (well WWE isn't exactly real, but you know what I mean.)-Steel Cage match vs AI is still boring and broken when playing Coop vs AI when we can let one enemy AI to get out and we can 2v1 the other guy until he's flat and we both can exit the cage simultaneously.-Crowd looks more packed and somewhat believable and less cringeworthy than 2k16.-Be warned though, there is no Hall of Fame like game mode like 2k16 where you got to play as Stone Cold and got to relive his real matches with cinematic real life footage. But there is a Wrestler creation section of course and that has a story mode. Basically this is a big drawback for those interested in playing more story related content.-There is a WWE Universe mode, which I don't know if it was present in previous WWEs, but here you get to make custom alliances, rivalries and even have run in interferences during / before / after matches, which adds to more wwe realism. You can simulate or play the matches that you like and this is sort of like a never ending story mode. There are promos to make any wrestler a Face or Heel too.-Heard online multiplayer has flaws, but I haven't tried it nor want to play it online. Great for couch coop with friends. Also other reviews here say the game crashes a lot, but hasn't occured to me even once yet maybe because my pc is good. i7 4790k @4 ghz, 16gb ram and gtx 970.-Overall, if you own 2k16 this doesn't change too much, with less story related content, but packs a bunch of improvements and extra features in the details that 2k16 lacks. So for those looking for local coop, this should be great, especially if you own an ultrawide monitor."

,Not Recommended,510510,33102217,Posted: 1 July,all,Avonar,"It's not a bad game all in all but the multitude of bugs mean that I just cannot recommend this.First and foremost, crashes. I get crashes during matches and Create a Moveset. Sometimes it works fine, other times I have played the same match 3 or 4 times in a row. This is just ridiculous.Second, the My Career mode has some major failings, first and foremost the authority stuff. You get a challenge to complete during the match, put on a 4 star match, perform 2 finishers, things like that. It is an interesting take...in theory. Unfortunately there is a massive disconnect between the challenge and the gameplay. You are sometimes told to lose a match, which would make it seem more like an actual wrestling match except for the fact that losing a fact has no positives. You lose points in your rivalry, you get much fewer upgrade points, and there is no story benefits either. And that's not including the ones that just don't work. I have been told to win by DQ with no way of doing it, the opponent refused to use a weapon or anything. I have been told to win with green health, and then be attacked in a scripted cutscene making this impossible...it's bad.My Universe works...kind of. It automates the matches, and editing them will throw off rivalry plans, title matches etc, I never felt like I was in full control.I also don't like the VC Points. You get them at the end of each match, and you can use them to upgrade a My Career character, buy skills/managers and also unlock movesets. The best movesets are very expensive, and all they give you are a small number of famous WWE wresters' moves. The moves are all ranked A-D so the ones you really like and want to use might be the worst ones, while the best ones you don't want to use. The VC points are also universal across every My Career mode and My Universe mode, so spending them in one gamemode means you can't use them in another.On the upside, I do like the gameplay. It usually feels fairly fluid, you can't reverse every single thing so it gives an element of strategy, however it is not hard by any means. It's a nice, mindless game really. It's a game with potential, however as it seems not to have ever been patched it is never going to realise that potential. A buy on sale if you really want a PC wrestling game."
76561198101510861,Recommended,510510,32729600,Posted: 24 June,all,smearygore674,"I currently have 126 hours invested into this game. I think as a fan of WWE its a pretty good game. The game gets a bad rep on steam because of Take-Two. But I never played GTA or wanted multiplayer anyway so I have no problem with their stuff. The game is fun though I recommend you get it when it is on sale and I would recommend just buying all the dlc for like 25-30 bucks. I will go through the Pros and Cons now.Pros--Lots of Wrestlers for several Wrestling Eras.-Lots of moves for your wrestler to use.-Universe mode is fun though could be improved by adding more customizable story lines for you to have for your wrestlers.-Wrestling is fun and enjoyable to do.-My Career is fun but can get very repetitive and boring fast.Cons--Like I said, Career mode can get repetitive, I was looking to achieve a US title match. And I worked myself up to #3 in the rankings. I have been #3 for many in game months and still have not moved up but I keep getting matches against John Cena (the current US champ) and I beat him every time yet I dont move up. So every pay-per-view I never get a titles match. That just makes it a bit irritating to play the game.-CAW is a bit lacking. Does not have quite the customizable features that wwe 2K16 had.-I never played 2K16 but I have watched people play it, I wish they had brought back the custom moves, where you could make your very own unique move. Yet that is also gone.-No integrated music. In other games and even on the Xbox version of 2k17, from what I understand you can integrate your own music to use as intro music for wrestlers. Not the case for PC since I have tried and tried over and over to find a way to use custom music, so you are basically stuck with the crap music they have for you to choose from.Now from what I may have said in the Cons, many may think I give it a bad review. I dont really mean to, its an OK game. Maybe a 6.5-7/10. Its above average but needs work to make it better. More customizable pieces in the game like integrated music, creating custom moves and a upgraded CAW would help a lot. Also some minor issues like me getting 5 matches in a row with John Cena yet never moving up the ranks even though I beat him every time. That needs to be fixed because I get on and just keep facing him every week yet I get no reward in the form of a titles match. Either way its a good game, and like I said 6.5-7/10."

,Recommended,510510,29886361,Posted: 12 February,all,Jakashi,"Not a bad game, one of the better of recent years for the WWE series.Theres a lot more customization which is always a high point in the WWE games as it's something you will; find yourself spending hours on as always.The replayability is definitely there if you have the time to waste days in the My Career mode as it is exactly what it say's on the tin, challenge the authority or become a heyman guy. You can change your movesets at any point, earn more moves by winnning matches/rivalries/promos/T shirt sales. It reall is about molding yourself into a great superstar.Challenging anyone to a rivalry is awesome , earning championships and defending them actually gets you excited because of the hard work you put in to earn them, especially  while on a higher difficulty.I like the reverse system its easy to use and is all about timing which is similar to the previous games, although sometimes it can bug out and not show up, it will most likely get fixed in patches, if they care about the pc version.(This is my first WWE pc game so I am unsure if the developers care more about consoles or pc)My main problems are the referee and the camera, sometimes it's impossible to see where you are or when to prompt a reversal because you have him in the way or the cameras stuck in a certtain angle.Also the referee sometimes decides to take a lap or two around the players before starting a pin count, which can be pretty aggrivating when it matters.Rivalrys can be fun, sometimes weird, recently decided to call out Brock Lesnar, he became my rival which is great, problem being I have fought him twice in about 2 months of events, suprisingly I have fought john cena in literally every match apart from two PPV's in the last 4 months during this rivalry with Brock, trust me there's only so many times you want to fight Cena, takes a lot of work to bring him down even when you dominate him he will get out of a pin after your 5th finisher .Overall the game looks beautiful and has its ups and downs as with each WWE game. It has a lot of potential with or without a few patches I will put in countless hours playing.8/10 for its Genre7/10 in GeneralPrice tag to be honest i'd wait for the sale unless you are an avid fan."

,Recommended,510510,29782002,Posted: 8 February,all,Goodie,"WWE 2k17 fixes a lot of my gripes about previous editions. They stepped it up on graphics and people look way more realistic this year than ever. Face scanning is actually done correctly in this game allowing the community to do amazing things. They took the restrictive editing of imported superstars from last year in MyCareer as you can change everything about downloaded content. The matches are more exciting and not a drag. I recall last year having to completely destroy your opponent no matter who it is to win. This year it actually matters who you face. I've had matches with Sin Cara that last about 5 mins and matches against Seth Rollins that take 10-15 mins where we actually pushed each other to the limit. The MyCareer isn't as grindy as previous years which I like a lot more. VC is more easily obtained and you aren't grinding for 100 hours to get your character to a decent level.Tutorials in this game are a hit or miss, there are some things that are well explained and others that aren't explained at all. Leaving to a lot of confusion sometimes. Nothing that will ruin the experience for you but it can be slightly annoying. The game currently crashes sometimes during loading transitions which is a big part of the game. I assume it will be fixed but it has been an issue for almost 2 days now. I also wish they allowed you to skip the intro to the show every week. Not only is it super repetitive but it is also glitched to where the logo on the titantron constantly loops, creating an annoying sound. The Characters voiceover is questionable. I don't know if it's glitched or if they are supposed to not have dialouge in promo's and such. They did last year so it only makes sense that they would right?Overall WWE 2k17 is a great experience that will leave you wanting to play and is definitely a step forward for the franchise. It's a little buggy and they could have made better choices here and there but it's worth a look at.Score: 7.5/10"

There is no chance for actual reaction in this game, only hitting reverse a minute before anything begins to happen. I dont want a mini game to get out of a submission hold. If I wanted that, I would play Mario Party. I also dont want a timing/guessing game for holds, I just want a block button that you can hit at the right time when a move is actually starting.

We need more legends in these games to keep hardcore fans interested, removing people from the roster for no reason is not a good idea. Yukes should continue to expand the roster every year until we have the 'perfect' wrestling game but until then, I guess I recomend this game."

,Not Recommended,510510,33014152,Posted: 29 June,all,ShadowAngel,"Another WWE game, there was a time when i bought them on release for full price and it's kinda funny that 2K taking over the game has led me to buy them only after a heavy discount. The series is getting more stale than the Warrior as Champion back in 1990 where he quickly fell from being a near level to Hogan to the worst drawing World Champion in History at that point. 2K14 brought changes, away from the ""play 1 wrestler or a made up wrestler in a linear story"" that the WWE games under THQ had (WWE 12 with its endless backstage fights against HHH, Animal and Vader are still a nightmare i remember) and with the fact that 2K does NBA 2K so they kinda know how to make a career mode, it's actually sad to say that in 4 years (2K14, 2K15, 2K16, 2K17) the caree mode is still the same old crap, with illogical feuds, a non-existing Face/Heel divide and superficial features patched in that don't really work. The T-Shirt Sale thing is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Steve Austin had the biggest T-Shirt sales since Hulkamania while rarely wearing a T-Shirt to the Ring, same with The Rock but in 2K17 we're forced to put a shirt on our character or otherwise nobody buys a shirt and we lose out on VC....)The other new feature is a promo feature. In your Career you can do a promo segment where you have to select one of four statements you want to give (with a time limit to select them) and they decide wether the audience likes you, hates you, you're a heel or face and the authority likes you. The fact that you can't do promos while being in a feud with an opponent and the fact that no promos start in a feud are laughable, promos are what a feud drives forward, at this point i wonder if the developers actually ever saw a wrestling show.Also you have to buy moves with VC which you have to earn through matches, i guess next year they offer to get VC for real money since Take Two is all about microtransactions now but having to get 8 million VC just to get your Wrestler maxed out when you get 9000 VC per match and a low amount from T-Shirt sales only when you have a shirt is questionable to say the least.Also you can only import your own music via third party tools and the Roster is questionable, it's the biggest licensed one (otherwise Fire Pro with up to 500 wrestlers still takes the cake since all there wasn't licensed were the names) but you have to wonder why they decided to add Road Dogg and Billy Gunn but remove X-Pac (was in 2K16) so you can't have a proper D-Generation X. The Freebirds as Hall of Fame members lack Terry ""Bam Bam"" Gordy with the HoF Showcase match only being a Tag-Team match because of that and they removed the Honky Tonk Man but added Greg Valentine this year, so we can't have Rhythm 'n Blues from 1990?Gameplay wise it's the same as the last 3 years, button combination and reversals with some QTE's thrown in. The graphics are also basically the same but  the system requirements are higher with some weird slowdowns especially when climbing the cage in a Steel Cage match.The commentators are horrible and again i wonder how that can be. NBA 2K has some great commentating, the best in sports games today, so 2K and Visual Concepts who work on both games should bring in the same quality to WWE...yet, they don't. You get the same repetitive lines over and over and over again and the commentators blast you for doing the same move twice in one match, even if it's just a punch!The licensed songs are abysmal except for Sabbath's Paranoid, the Wrestler Themes are only available in highly shortened versions so they sometimes loop thorugh long entrances but vial mods you can iject the proper songs and also replace some fantasy themes with themes for your CAWOnline so far has been a bit more stable than in 2K16, at least i hadn't had  desync so far and with a friend or multiple friends it is fun.Is the game worth it? I guess for the 70% off currently it might be worth if you like wrestling. Personally i decided that this was my last WWE 2K game until they make the career worthwhile and bring the gameplay closer to something that is fun and not just a reversal and qte-fest."

At all. However, that doesn't mean there's not problems with the game stability as it seems to crash horribly for others. The game itself actually runs decently, with a few stutters at the beginning of the match that don't really affect my game too much.However, the quality of the game...well that's where it tends to fall apart.First off, online mode. 0.6% of everyone who plays has earned a bronze medal in online mode, and there's a reason for that. Not because it's hard, because there is no online mode.Secondly, that price. Ok, 2k games are expensive, I get that. But if I'm gonna pay $50 for your game, and you're not even going to give me an entire game mode or Shinsuke Nakamura without me spending even more money, then we have a problem.Thirdly, the gameplay itself.

This is the generation of game players where creation and how far you can take it is a money maker. So if 2K/WWE wants to continue making money then ther better get there stuff together and take this game to the point of WWE 12 if memory serves me correctly. Where you could create your own finisher move by move and Create a Superstar was not so limited. CAS slots are still @ 100 since 2K took it over and i remember that THQ had the number up to 150 , i am expecting major improvements in Creation Suite all around and a major increase in CAS slots (nothing below 250) before i buy another game. 2K said that they was going to make this game better , lier lier pants on fire. 2k if you do make the comment that it is due to limited space on a game console or computer (computer being the obvious on unlimited space) come on you can get Xbox One and PS4 systems with up to 1 TB (which leaves at least 250 GB for WWE games if needed). So how about you little boys over at 2K put on your big boy pants and put some serious effort in making this series worth it again.

It tends to crash quite a bit, which is bad considering it's been months since this was released on console. I don't regret buying this game, but I probably should have waited to pick this up when it dropped to $30 or so. Unless you're a die hard wrestling fan I wouldn't pick this up for the price and I would say get it on console.It's defintely a far cry from the wrestling games I played as a child. Also, can you not leave the Hell in a Cell? Why do I need a special to put someone through an announcers table? The MyCareer is pretty weird, too. I have put in 30 hours strictly in MyCareer and I have only had the NXT title. I am constantly facing Samoa Joe for the title in PPV's and I hardly climb the contender rankings (I'm at #5 for the Intercontinental).

JBL sounds consistantly like he's talking to you live, directly from his left nostril.. with a cucumber sandwich jammed up his right nostril, while he simultaneously has the WORST headcold in human history.  King has like... 4 or 5 sentences he just repeats on a loop.. over.. and over.. and over.. (that's a pun for those who've played the game.. its painful.)  Cole takes the cake though.. he goes from 1 sentence repeated, to 1 sentence uttered from across an empty parking lot on a windy day, to regular voice, to REALLY LOUD VOICE.  In the same match, within 3 sentences.I distinctly remember being able to name your finishing move, as well as having the announcers use your ACTUAL name and nickname for matches in previous years!  WHY would you take that out!?  Now its like PS2 all over again with ""Oh.. ""the Finisher"" (said with all the conviction of a porn actor) and repeatedly referring to you ""a bright  young superstar"" over.. and over.. again.That's it for voices too btw.. your promos (dont even get me started on how pointless and overly complicated they are.) interviews, head to heads etc etc.. all complete silence.

It's a complete crashfest, and there hasn't been any updates or hotfixes, however minor, released.  I don't get much FPS dips (I play with FXAA on, MSAA off, Textures high, audience density high but tessalation off, locked at a better framerate, and no Entrances/camera cuts or in-match replays, and no camera shakes).  In matches, even if it's a 6-man match, I get fluid FPS.  But it crashes randomly, at no set interval in a match (sometimes early on, sometimes just before that final pincount).  I get crashes loading into certain creation areas - I don't crash in move-sets, entrances or arenas, but have consistently inconsistent crashes simply editing a wrestler (and it's never while I'm editing, it's just when it's loading into it).  This happens to both original superstars and WWE superstars.The game, itself, as a game, is really good.  I've only done exhibition matches and creation stuff (CAWs, Arenas, Videos) because I'm waiting for some kind of stability update *if any* before I really dig in.I tried to go back to 2K16 after frustrations of crashes, but it's just not as fun as I've found 2K17 to be.I'll update this review if the game gets some tender love and care, but until then, I don't recommend supporting a game that's in this state.  I'm kinda sour I did, because now I can't enjoy 2K16 knowing how much better 2K17 is, in terms of gameplay, graphics, roster and creation stuffs...Oddly enough, Ladder Matches work this year.  2K16 had the notorious bug that would slow gameplay when the hanging belt was touched in a Ladder Match.

76561197988113155,Recommended,510510,30696682,Posted: 23 March,all,SAF,"I liked WWE 2k16 a lot, you can check out my review on that version, it wasn't perfect, but it was the best wrestling game in the last several years. Fast-forward to 2k17 and not a lot has changed, which is good, but I'll explain why this version is even better for me.First off, I highly recommend the game if you like wrestling games. It's one of my favorites of all time, but if you didn't like 2k16 for whatever reason, you probably won't like 2k17, but it depends. CAW, which is my favorite feature in any wrestling game, is better in most ways in 2k17 than it has ever been.I 've created about 30 wrestlers so far, so I've used it extensively. They've added a lot to every catagory (hair styles, clothes, teeth, etc...) but one HUGE disappoint for me is that you still cannot create little people. I would love to create a much shorter wrestler, but the shortest you can go is only 5'6"", which continues to bum me out year after year. How hard would it be to extend the range of heights to under 5 foot??? I want to make a dwarf dammit!Aside from that, you pick from body types and pre-made parts (arms, legs, chest, etc...) instead of using a body slider. This is a step back as it doesn't let me have the customization we once had. Gone are the days of making an incredibly huge breasted thin woman. Not that I create that type of CAW or anything...other than that, the CAW has improved in every possible way=more of everything!It still irratates me that Yukes always does this year after year. Adds something, takes away. No create-a-finisher either, in this version, but next year they'll tout it as a ""brand new never before seen feature!!!"" Love/hate relationship when it comes to Yukes.The graphics are a bit better, but some wrestlers actually look like♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to others. Not a big deal to me because I usually just use my CAWs, but you can tell some wrestlers got a little more tlc than others. Audio is pretty much poop as  Diddy's song selection is downright ""weird"" for a wrestling video game, but again, no issue, as I turn on most every wrestler's entrace as my menu music (jukebox). The commentary has been recycled for the last 5 years but it doesn't really bother me much, I'm more in this game for the actual gameplay.The gameplay is about the same as 2k16, but with slight improvments! A 2nd opportunity to reverse on certain moves, the option to change the god-awful submission system to more of a classic button mashing submission system, and the ""Break Out"" feature after the match, which allows you to further pummel a wrestler you have already beaten. I LOVE these new features. ! The game pace is still more geared towards simulation, so expect slower pacing, not blazing fast arcade pacing. Although you can change some options, and that gets us to my final point...If you don't like the game and you think it's utter ****, for the love of all that is holy and sacred in this world, CHANGE THE SETTINGS!!!! and change the balancing!!!!! I cannot emphasize this enough!!! I really did not enjoy this game that much until I changed some settings. The pacing was too slow and the time the wrestlers were stunned was way too long, which made for a very boring match! After tweaking the balance, I'm good to go, and now have a bit faster paced matches. That may not be your cup of tea, but there is plenty of settings you can change to make the match more fun for you, whatever that may be. Guys/gals, seriously, I've been playing wrestling games since NES, the settings in these Yukes titles can make a big difference.In closing wwe 2k17 is the best we have yet on PC just don't go in expecting a No Mercy as everyone seems to do, every friggin year...ugh...in ways it's better than No Mercy,, the CAW feature alone will keep you entertained. As far as issues with crashes, rare, in my playtime only 3 times so far and it was during load, not during the middle of anything, so I never lost any data. Runs smooth maxed 60fps 24/7 on my system.***I do not play any wrestling games online mode after atrocious matches I tried to have in a much earlier version, I believe it was wwe 10 or something, spamming the same move was the name of the game. Know going in that online in any wrestling game is a low priority and it should never be bought for that, it usually does not work well at all with many people picking a wrestler who is fast and can pull off the same exact fast move, over and over, so I could care less about MP in a wrestling game"

,Not Recommended,510510,30654648,Posted: 21 March,all,ADZE,"It feels a bit sparse, and in my eyes it doesn't quite compare to some of the earlier games in the series. It's as though more effort went into the earlier games. I haven't played many of the WWE games in years, in fact the last one I actually owned was WWE SvR 2009. Therefore with an 8 year gap between games, the difference in quality is striking, whether this is due to the series being taken over by 2K or just a general lack of creativity among the creators. It feels very uninspired and unfinished. I understand that these guys are expected to put out a new game every year, but still.The graphics are better than 2009 etc, but that's to be expected and not something that I focus on much. It does make my PC lag pretty badly, but with a crappy little box like mine, that's more my fault than theirs.The MyCareer mode feels outright repetitive with the illusion of challenges thrown in to try and spice up the repetitive slog of match after match after match. It also bugs me that you go straight from the training facility to WWE RAW. In my second week I was put up against Brock Lesnar. There's no sense of build-up, aside from the paper-thin Championship rankings, etc. I get that this is how it's been for years now, but in previous years the Career mode had actual storylines with rivalries and choice-based branching paths. This version doesn't even have voice acting besides the commentators, the ringside announcers, and A-Train near the start. This is how it was in WWE 2005, 12 years ago! And even then, WWE 2005 had actual storylines. It feels like 2K decided to focus more on implementing larger rosters and ""sharp, fluid gameplay"" rather than making things actually entertaining.It's very jarring to have your match interrupted with an Instant Replay whenever you do something big. It's a great example of putting realism before player enjoyment. I just did the move! I know how it works! I don't need to have the pace of the match brought to a screeching halt to see it 3 more times. Save it for the post-match highlights if you need to put it somewhere. I know I can skip it, but it still throws me off, because *it doesn't happen every time you do your finisher*. You can't be prepared for it! At least you can choose to turn settings like these off.The AI is choppy at times. Every now and again you'll get thrown to the floor and your opponent will instead step out onto the apron and throw punches at thin air. Or else your teammates/opponents will get out of te ring and not try to climb back in before the 10-count. I won't mention the glitches though. Those have been around for ages and they're not getting fixed any time soon.One thing though - and I'm not sure if I messed up or if something's actually wrong, but in MyCareer mode, my created superstar's entrance music doesn't play despite me making 110% sure that it does. The post-match music works perfectly though. What gives?Also - and this is something I've seen tons of other people complain about - the game keeps crashing! I have to constantly hold thumbs that the game won't conk out when I'm in the middle of doing something important. Yesterday I spent 20+ minutes tweaking my created superstar's moveset when the game crashed out of nowhere and I lost all my progress. Seriously, there's like a 50% chance that if I try to edit my character it'll crash. And then I need to wait 5 minutes for the damn thing to boot up again (if I don't give up and play something else for a while) and run the risk of it just crashing again. The PC version has been out for nearly two months! Surely this is something that could (and should) have been fixed early on? I'd be so much happier if I could just play the damn thing. Please just fix the crashing issue and I can deal with the rest. Are we just on our own from now on? This stuff is game-breaking. People are spending serious money on a game that only works when it feels like it.It also bugs me that I can't skip cutscenes. I'm so sick of watching the RAW and SmackDown intro sequences.I do like how they can read out my full name though :P ""From Cape Town, South Africa... Adam McKay!"" I never get tired of that. I also like the roster, with the potential to buy a ton of bonus superstars (and for in-game currency too, thank god!)As I mentioned before, this game feels unfinished, making me wonder if I should have bought one of the earlier games instead. Considering that you don't really get your money's worth, I probably wouldn't recommend it to a friend. There's just so much missing from previous years that were awesome! Finisher creators, Storyline creators, Career storylines, actual voice acting! I get that the game is already 40+ GB as it is, but making it seem less sparse would definitely make people enjoy it more. As it is, I feel silly for paying so much for something with not very much to offer. I feel as though I'm lumbered with it, rather than being the proud owner of my first WWE game in 8 years.It's not fun."

I mean, WOW! this game released after consoles like 4 months and they couldn't even release a polished PC version. Not to mention that this game NOT worth an upgrade if you already own WWE2K16. This game has worse version of CAW. Performance problem (way lagger than 2K16 but can barely see any differences in graphics). Ugly looking menu. No 2K showcase (not counting the crappy HOF showcase that comes with season pass). I have played every WWE games since Here Comes the Pain.

It's 70% off in the summer sale but that's still 70% off something that was 30% over priced to begin with, probably more like 60% over priced when you factor in the DLC not having been included. These games are always released horribly out of date anyway then they charge for people that should've been in already. This seems to have led to poor sales (2K16 sold about 170,000 while this sold about 29,000 according to Steamspy) along with with the factor of 2K16 having been a broken mess that was never fixed, which in turn led to there not being much going on in the community creations section. Also this greed has led to there being less and less new content in the actual game release and it's not up to what it should've been to begin with unless you buy the season pass/deluxe version. Oh good, here are the women that should've been in last year, and...? Umm? Here's Brock Lesnar on the cover! Yeah, that sold great, huh? Showcase mode? DLC only! And just imagine having to pay to edit stats in NBA 2K or Madden or any other yearly sports game? Pay $5 to tweak gameplay? They'd be laughed out of the industry and yet somehow they've been getting away with it here for years. I think maybe 2K found out you can fool the console players but PC players know better and know when they're getting screwed over.Better to wait about 2 weeks and get Fire Pro World than buy this during the sale. That goes double in non-USA reigons. Fire Pro will probably be $21.99 Canadian if it's in line with other $20 games, whereas this is $25 Canadian for the pretty much must have deluxe version so not only will it be a better game, it'll be cheaper too.This is the Cena/Styles II of games. WWE will tell you it's the best but it wasn't even better than the last one. (Summerslam match was way better.) They try to sell it as 5 stars but we know better.Fire Pro World will be the Omega/Okaka II of games and deliver everything you loved about it the last time then give you more you didn't expect and be the 6.25 star (out of 5) match you wanted.

Zero issues.  looks good too.I am not a WWE fan.  i am a fan of video games.  i went into this thinking the over-the-top antics would translate into a very fun video game.  who wouldn't love to fly through the air landing on people like a super hero?  i am a big fan of 2K sports games, the NBA games in particular.  i am also a big fan of MMA games.  so i figured this would be a good video game for me.the gameplay is boring.  i'm judging that purely on a video game standpoint.  more than anything else i sit around watching the game play itself waiting to hit R2.  you literally can't stand up and move around until you 'reverse"" a move the other guy is doing.  until then you watch the guy strut around pretending he's the best ever.  and if you miss the timing on hitting R2 to reverse the move you just continue to watch while the guy takes 5 seconds to twist your legs up into a pretzel.  i've never been into watching games play themselves.once you manage to reverse a move it's your turn.  you stand next to the guy and press a button.  then you watch to see if he counters, or if the move happens.  that's it.  you press a button and watch for 5 seconds.  then you press a button again.  wait for 5 seconds.  oh no!  this time he reversed you.  now you can't press whatever button you want you'll have to press R2 at a specific moment.  it's simply not fun gameplay.another issue i have is playing dress up with the characters.  i play career mode in all my sports games.  in this career mode you are forced to constantly change your tshirt and your moves.  this takes too much time as the menus are large and take a long time to load.  this is something i always tried to avoid in the MMA games.  this game glorifies that.  it makes sense because it's the WWE.  it doesn't translate to a fun video game however.  i want to play the game, not sift through menus.then we get to the ""pagentry"" of the WWE.  this game tries to show all of it.  are you familiar with the press conferences in NBA 2K?  know how you wish you could just skip that and get to the next game?  in WWE you must go out of your way to speak to the crowd, or your character's stats will suffer.  every guy has an entrance.  all the stuff you normally press start to skip in NBA just takes four times as long here.  i want to play the game, not look at how pretty the lights are when some guy comes walking towards the ring.the fights are varied, which is definitely a positive compared to MMA games.  there are 4 way brawls, 3 on 3, 2 on 2, and others.  this definitely helps during the course of a long career.the game isn't horrible by any means.  as stated it runs perfectly on my comp.  the controls are tight, for what they are.  graphics are great but nowadays i can't ever complain about that.  however once you've dealt with all the menus, light shows, talking trash at other wrestlers and actually get into a match it just isn't fun to play."

WWE 2k17 is the first game since WWE 2k14 (Xbox 360) that I've satisfied with the roster that has come out... The Goldberg extras along with the WCW Monday Nitro arena were big factors in persuading me to purchase this game. I'll give the pros and cons of the game below.. but I'm gonna explain why I'm giving this game a thumbs down here... Simply put the game literally shuts off my computer in Career mode making it unplayable and I noticed it once else while playing as Psycho Sid vs Sting. The game needs these bugs fixed before I can endorse it, as others can/will/could have the same issues I'm experiencing...until then the game will be rated negatively.Pros - WCW Arena, Characters: Goldberg, DDP, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Booker T, Sid Vicious (Psycho Sid), Sting, Lex Luger etc etc.. This gives me a nice roster to enjoy the days of old!Entrances seems much better than previous games, as well as crowd reactions.Acceptable roster size and variation (not great but acceptable).Cons - No Scott Steiner (which should be an automatic with a game focused on WCW and Goldberg). No Batista despite him being in 2k15 (not sure if he was in 2k16 as I didn't buy it). No Hulk Hogan.Game crashes and or shuts down my computerRoster could use less vanilla midgets / modern wrestlers and more Icons of the past...."

I have two top of the line devices that can play heavy graphic games, but this games is bad on both. Tried watching a match in universal mode, and it takes about 30 or more minutes to watch a short match, because of everyone moving in slow motion. This is after all the graphics setting set to the lowest possible settings.  This game does not translate well for the PC.

And the worst part is, the only way you ever wrestle anyone knew is by starting fueds, and becoming their rivals.But rivalries can be fun, that is until you win all your matches and dominate them on the mic only to lose the rivalry... the game makes no sense. After a couple of weeks it wants you to change your move set and attire, I do so, and everyone still hates it.

Not only is it hard to tell what you are actually saying. Button: [""I am doing this for the Universe""] Said: ""I'm doing this for the Universe, the real one not the WWE Universe."" Why the ♥♥♥♥ would I ever want to say that?! If I wanted to say that the button should have been [""I'm doing this for the real Univers not the WWE Universe""]. They lack voice overs, which didn't bother me. When you are saying a heel is a coward, it makes you more of a heel?! Even if I somehow manage to finish to promo of with a little bit of face value instead of my maxed heel. It manages to put itself back somehow. I don't know what crowd types are for, I never seem to know if a button is Hardcore or Family Friendly. It seems that strong reaction bouneses come up at random points.That is just with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ promo engine, I could code a better one.Backstage brawls are 65%♥♥♥♥♥♥to be honest. I ambush Cesaro in an interview, he reverses 99% OF MY MOVES. And I can't get the timing down. Not only this. But I hit a signature and a finisher on him. Which should have ended the brawl. This went on FOR 10 MINUTES OF BEING BEATEN DOWN BY CESARO AFTER I AMBUSHED HIM. You are never really able to get backstage except for a falls count anywhere/no DQ match. I don't know why the ♥♥♥♥ Roman Reigns is giving an interview with Renee Young in the middle of MY MATCH. Does Triple H have his office set up in every arena like that?

I was #2 contender for the U.S. title for 8 ingame months and Barron held the titles for that entire time. Brock Lesnar hasn't dropped the World Title for all 4 years In my MyCareer game so far. And why is Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose a tag team. Besides fueding 5-6 months before the game came out. A fix that could take 15 minutes? 30 minutes?

Gameplay wise I've had several moments where I've just had to shut off the game due to frustration, sometimes due to glitches and performance issues, and other times due to actual design features that defy logical thought.

Also, some finishers first require you to properly position you opponent and until that is done the finisher will never trigger, I would have liked for finishers to do all the setup needed to perform the move rather than having the player to do it all.Also, I almost always missed the reversal prompt, and the cpu would constantly reverse my attacks, grapple, and finishers/signature moves, so I almost always lost on the matches.Finally, the submission system is extremely hard, you can easily loose a match you dominated, if the cpu performs a submission move. Overall, I find it too difficult to play and win, and therefore would not recommend this game."

,Recommended,510510,30005041,Posted: 18 February,all,Frendle,"So the last rasslin' game I played was WWE 2k15, and this is an immense improvement over that.  I played a lot of PS1/2/3/4 rasslin games too, and I think with 2k17 they are finally getting back to the expectations that those titles from many years ago set for me.THE GOOD:- all the mini-games are great, I'm a big fan of the submission system.  They're not too complicated but they feel skillfull and thankfully there's no button mashing.  No more being at the mercy of simple dice rolls to determine the outcome of the match, now I can get good at stuff and feel like I actually won or lost.  It makes the whole thing feel more gamey.- character abilities so far have led a very satisfying air of strategy to matches.  It's nothing too complex, but I do find myself using strategies to get 5 star matches while avoiding a loss.  This whole part feels a bit more fleshed out and better thought out than it did in 2k15.- the game is a lot more clear about how to get 5 star matches, and it lets you know how well you're doing on that during the match.  This goes hand in hand with my previous comment because it really shapes my choices during the match.  If I'm on the verge of getting five stars I might pull some risky stuff for a great match and try to be clever with the use of my wrestler's abilities to mitigate the risk.  Sometimes it backfires on me and I have to adjust to a losing situation - have had some very exciting match endings because of this!- character creater has so many options it's silly.  In fact, some of the things you can put on your character are kind of silly.  Everything looks great too - I've basically made the same guy in every rasslin' game I ever played, but this time around he looks the coolest!  In fact, he looks more like an actual guy than some of the actual wrestlers in the game do - first time I've seen created wrestlers look more high def than the real guys lol- Career mode is hugely improved.  Things started kicking off immediately - a few matches in I was slowly on my way to a title, and part of a rivalry.  Lots of little interactions happen in between of matches as well, and overall you get a lot more options to interact with your career.  Compared to the nothing that was the 2k15 career mode, this is pretty fantastic and was the one part of the game where I really wanted to see some improvement.THE OKAY- I'm a bit half and half on the reversal system.  It feels like having more reversals than your opponent is just such a hard numerical advantage because once he's done reversing, you still can.  End result: you are in charge of the match every time an exchanges of reversals end. I would have liked to see some more mechanics that allow you to get reversals back to sort of break this pattern.  Certain reversals being able to lockout your opponents reversals temporarily is a start - but again, works better for the wrestler who has more reversals.- the promo system, where your character walks out to the ring and flaps their jaw, or gets into some verbal sparring with another wrestler is on the one hand a really exciting mechanic for the game.  However, the choices feel really cryptic like the little chunk of preview text you choose doesn't always let you know what your character is really going to say.  The fact that you have to match up both your general tone on various subjects along with a face/heel image in order to get a strong reaction out of the current type of crowd means those choices need to be pretty clear.  I pick something that I think is gonna be a nice friendly face comment for a family friendly crowd, and next thing you know I'm being a huge heel.THE BAD- character creater doesn't have body morphing sliders ( or if there are any I haven't found them ) which reduces the ability to really fine tune your created wrestlers.- I have pretty decent hardware and I had to fiddle with graphics settings to get the game running smoothly.  I still basically have graphics settings maxed though, so everything looks fantastic.  Overall it runs great though - feels generalyl more responsive than 2k15."

,Not Recommended,510510,29777326,Posted: 8 February,all,TheJeydonWalien,"I'll start off with the positive. I DO like this game. Several hours into it and already I've seen enough content to say that it's vastly improved from WWE 2k16, which was my favourite wrestling game since SvR 2008. And the beauty of it is I have only scraped the surface!However.What makes this a negative view is the release itself. 5 months late into the party - we wait patiently for the THIRD time in a row. Alright, good job 2K games, you ported it quicker this time. But still 5 months.... and guess what? We have to purchase the DLC's, even the simple ones like the accelerator or the NXT booster. I'd happily purchase them, IF the game came out on PC at the same time (or at least near enough!) as the console releases. Sure, we get Goldberg. Mkay. As epic as he is, it still feels like 2K is being greedier than ever this year round.Buy if you don't care for buying the DLC's (fortunately i don't), or don't care about the whole situation. The content itself is wonderful. But if the way a game company handles it's releases effects your decision on paying for a game or not, then hold onto your wallet with this one."

,Recommended,510510,34172699,Posted: 11 August,all,LuciditySam,"As much as I enjoy this game and typically turn to this game when I just want to unwind and relax, this game has some glaring flaws.The gameplay itself usually is very good but that's only if you can ignore major issues that arise here and there. Irish whip your target into the turnbuckle and there's a possibility that when you use your running strike that you will just bounce off your opponent like you missed. Outside of table matches, tables will not break if you try to drive your opponent through them due to a patch that broke how tables work. Not only that, but you won't even be able to pick the table back up. The announce tables work perfectly but not the regular tables. Then there's the issues with frame drops and, when using created wrestlers and arenas, the loading times can get very long. This is coming from someone using an i6700k CPU, 16GB of RAM, and a GTX1070. It is a locked 60 frames per second and, on my rig, it is pretty stable in terms of frame rate outside of when someone interrupts your entrance. At that point, it drops down to 30-40.Graphically, the game is tolerable. It's far from realistic-looking but it's not bad in terms of how it looks during gameplay and entrances. The problem is that it's got a lot of low-resolution textures and images for things like tattoos and logos. There are graphical glitches where you get a colored line (like a black line stretching from black fingernails, for example) on created characters at times. They're not too common but they do exist. The hair also does not act like hair; it's basically early PS3-level hair physics.The creation suit is very basic, though. I love creating new characters and entrances; it's very hard in this game to create anyone who is unique that would also be someone that could be a real character. You can create some weird♥♥♥♥♥♥ gorillas,  and stupid things like that but unless you're really good with uploading images, making face-scans, and things like that then you will have one hell of a time creating anyone unique without a mask or a ton of makeup caked on. Creating an entrance can sometimes be fun if you're into that, though my two biggest gripes is you can't use your custom entrance if you're holding a championship belt and the fact that you can't make custom lighting or choose camera angles. The camera angles make it very jarring because the number of hard cuts makes it obvious when the entrance doesn't match up (entering ring from left side, suddenly on ringside on the right in the next scene, for example).Simply put, if you can get this with the Season Pass for $25 or less and you can't wait until 2k18 releases for your platform of choice then definitely get this one. At full price at this point, I'd recommend against it. However, I have to give this a ""Recommended"" as I put hundreds of hours on the PS4 version and decided to rebuy it on PC. Between the bugs, how minimal the improvements from 2k16 are, and the very stripped-down/barebones creation suite? This is definitely a 6/10, maybe a 7/10 if you wanted to be generous. Hopefully 2k18 will be a significant improvement now that the PS3 and XBox 360 will no longer be supported."
