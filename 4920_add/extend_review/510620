,Recommended,510620,25925757,"Posted: 8 October, 2016",all,taloketo,"Edit: WASD + mouse control is supported now, and it's pretty awesome.I'm gushing with good feelings about this game. It is so well designed, I bet it's the best twin stick shooter design in ages. All game designers should be jealous of it.It's all in the details:4 level challenges give you a rewarding sense and forces you to play well. Great pacing.Enemies are faster when they're dead, which makes you question when to kill them and where to position yourself.You have to choose when to fire carefully because you move much faster when you're not shooting.Similar smart mechanics that always force you to think while you're killing. This makes the game better than most shooters around.There are some very original mechanics that surprised me quite a bit through the middle of the game.No filler. All levels matter.Normally when you have a minimalist visual style, it means that the developer has decided to make all game elements clear and there's no space for visual confusion. I think this game does this well AND still looks great.Procedural levels will keep me playing this game.Coop mode is funGripes:I would not mind some music with beats in the background. Generally not a huge fan of the sound design, although it gets the job done. I have to admit that the current mood helps the game to feel original.I think it'd possible to have a decent control mechanism with WASD + mouse so that players without controllers would be able to play. Not ideal, but better than nothing. The game can still say ""controllers are strongly recommended"" and that'd be alright.No options menu whatsoever. Game is fullscreen, forever.I think the player's collider size could be smaller for the player. Dodging stuff is very hard.Since the game design philosophy behind this game is strictly minimalist, the small gripes I have with the game are all caused by the decisions made with this philosophy in mind. But I still have almost nothing bad to say about the actual gameplay, which says a lot about how much I like the game.Absolutely recommended."

Not in the sense that ""omegehrd best game evah"" but it sets out to accomplish something and it just *nails* it. The visuals are gorgeously minimalistic, the audio is spot on, reactive and dronely efficient, and most of all, the gameplay is Swiss-Clock-Precise.Overall, it's a game that defies words, it kicks your♥♥♥♥♥with vehemence and you just get up asking for more. It's the kind of reactive and brutal experience you'd expect from a Dark Souls or Hotline Miami but without the flare and gore, without the overemphatic bosses and over the top visuals. This game is the old wise monk that looks like a joke but will put you down without blinking.THOTH tries something, delivers, overdelivers and you come back for seconds: massive amount of content, multiplayer and single player, hardcore design, damn unique in so many ways. Worth every peny."

With every set of levels you are introduced to a new type of enemy, requiring you to come up with new strategies to beat them. Some of them, like the expanding black holes, are both horrifying and extremely cool.This very challenging and sometimes nerve-wracking and horrifying game, combined with its chills-inducing music, keeps me hooked and coming back for more.Carlsen Games killed it with 140 and now they've done it again. Highly recommended for those seeking for a challenge."

,Not Recommended,510620,32613034,Posted: 21 June,all,TOG | Optimus BoxCrate,"Interesting game with some serious design flaws. I loved 140 and wanted to support the developer, but this is nowhere near 140, which was a pinnacle of both synaesthesia and gameplay design.The problem is that it's easy to fix - the sounds need to become more varied (interesting at first - think ""All of our Friends are Dead"", ""Au Sable"" and other Amon26 titles - but after the fourth level, they are stale and repetitive, and a littttle on the acrimonious side), and the ""back to the start of the level"" mechanic Should, by all rights, be a New Game Plus-style mode.As it is, after about 4 levels the gameplay varies, but the sounds stay the same, the constant repetition of doing the same levels over and over again until you beat all four in a row becomes tiresome rather than challenging.Probably easier with a twin-stick controller, but alright with mouse and keyboard, if you're used to that style of interaction (Decrysis is another game that does a similar thing).5/10."
76561198146362408,Recommended,510620,25911621,"Posted: 7 October, 2016",all,thescentofpaper,"Although I love all of the games Jeppe Carlsen has worked on, I must admit I was a tad bit skeptical about this being the ""anti-140"" (140 being almost everything I love in a game). However this has been a pleasant surprise (not that I thought it'd be bad, really)! Spent quite a bit of time playing it with my brother, and we both love it!Challenging would be an understatement. This game is pretty difficult. Maybe it's just me being bad at these kinds of games, but it can be pretty tedious to get through at times. Rewarding in the end though! If you like extremely challenging, quick paced, strategic games, then this is great.The soundtrack is unnerving, visuals are charming, and although it takes a bit of getting used to, the controls are pretty comfortable. Amazing game so far! Lots of fun both single player and co-op.(Edit: It isn't actually as hard as I had made it out to be. The reason it was so difficult was because I had it connected to our TV through HDMI so it lagged a bit. Definitely still challenging though.)"
,Recommended,510620,26592758,"Posted: 13 November, 2016",all,^3c^2abbag^3e,"TL;DR: THOTH has fresh new gameplay that tests your skill, and the sound design is top notch. Solid 9/10 - points off for lack of online multiplayer, lack of volume control, and erratic cubes.Jeppe has yet again created a game that is a truly unique experience, something that many game developers wish to obtain.Similar to 140, this game's minimalist design is deceptive. It's a fast-paced twin-stick shooter that has a brutal difficulty. The puzzle aspects of THOTH make it an exciting blend of wits and speed, and the constant barrage of new and exciting level designs keeps you on your toes.Speaking on the art and music of the game, it has similarities to 140 with the minimalist design, but instead contrasts the bright color palettes of the levels with dark, droning music that is almost sinister in a way. The chaotic tone of the music and sound design matches up perfectly with the game, with each level creating a new way to torture your mind and your reflexes.The one thing that bothers me is the random bouncing of many of the cubes, which can make it difficult to predict where to move. Although this does force you to keep contstant focus on the level as a whole, it can be a bit infuriating when a bad bounce catches you off guard.The lack of options (especially volume) doesn't bother me very much. The default volume is at such a level where it isn't too loud for me. While having to control the game volume from the system volume is a bit of an annoyance, it's not major issue that ruins the game."

,Recommended,510620,33005956,Posted: 29 June,all,Zincoshine,A savepoint only every 4 levels means the game can get extremely frustrating and annoying. Also the game is a bit unstable and does crash every once in a while. I cannot recommend this game until every level has a savepoint.edit: all issues have been resolved thanks to a speedy update and caring devs.

,Recommended,510620,26509774,"Posted: 9 November, 2016",all,fandegw,"The game is very addictive and produce this cool trans vibe of when playing a good die and retry, but there are some problems to solve to make it a pristine experience :- The animation of transition between levels SHOULD be skippable, it breaks the concentration builded for the precedent level, and build instead frustration each time you win a level (this should not happens, as the only way the game provides satisfaction is by winning).- There is a ""bug"" when using keyboard controls when beginning the next level : If you want to start the level in diagonal (let's say up-left with W and A), the game will only takes in account the first pressed. Again frustrating bug present in so many games. But for this game it is especially frustrating because of the game should provides consistency in its controls to never let the player conjure the game controls when losing.- This last one is little more special for PC : The game would profit a lot from a system of controls divided with one control stick from the gamepad for controling the dot, and the mouse to aim.This would provide the most precise aiming, but preserve a precise way of moving."

76561198080357795,Recommended,510620,32888560,Posted: 27 June,all,bowsers2,"Review changed after Major Difficulty adjustment. Now recommended. Original review still below.The quit inducing nighmare world of exessive difficulty is now gone in the latest patch. Now with a 2nd life every level that comes with lava for borders, as well as enemy and player movement speed cut down 10% fpr helpful improvements to space and enemy manageabiltiy.I maneged to finish the game and enjoyed myself straight after the patch.The end game has an even more challenging survial mode, which I think where the orginal excessive difficulty should be, and not in the main game.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Another game ruined by cult of diffiCULTy. Such a shame because the premise is a decent one in combining a very simple twin stick shooter with puzzle elements to survive and pass one screen levels.The checkpoint system of every fourth level feels completely arbitrary and artificial which forces the gamer to spend most of your time replaying levels that you already understand, completed and are bored by,  and having to repeat those levels just to get to and beat that difficult ""boss"" level to proceed to the next four levels feels so infuriatingly wrong.The difficulty is a disservice to the game -  and also I think  because it happens so often in other games, many developers artificially and extend play lenght through being hard, so to be able to charge more.  Value for money using difficulty is a popular way now days.  To me it ruins the ""nature"" of many games, especially here in Thoth.Theres a Meta aspect thats Dev income/costs related, that negatively effects some games, that doesn't get mentioned enough I think.There's No alternate difficulty levels -  of let's say every second level as a checkpoint or slowing down enemies for eg, which shows that difficulty tension dominates above all, even above this games puzzle elements.I quit this game after 1hr 30 min and about 30 levels in.Doing something basic in shooting fire options of having a wider spread shot that does less damage, or narrow beam that does more damage would be nice,  because all you've got is only one way of shooting bullets.Those weapon fire options would provide tactical options,  could act as another form of difficulty level,  or even reward/ be easier for more or less skillfull players. But none of that is in Thoth.Another positive is the weirdly haunting mechanical music, but that also doesn't jive with the visuals."

,Recommended,510620,34263499,Posted: 15 August,all,DoctorXOR,"Buy this game.I wish something like this had been in an arcade when I was little. The best thing about it is how complex such a simple concept reveals itself to be. You start the game, you move, you shoot at things.But then you start to think about momentum. You manipulate the speed of your enemies by carefully controlling their HP. You create entire strategies around a specific wall. It's fantastic how much the game sneaks into puzzle territory while continually training the skills needed to play FPS games (accuracy, reflexes, peripheral vision, multitasking, positioning...).That said, the final four challenges are absurdly difficult. If you try to eat the entire cake, you WILL get an upset stomach. Make sure to pace yourself (in general, not just for the final challenges) and go do something else with your life when you get frustrated. This game makes an amazing daily challenge; in fact that's exactly how I've spent the last few months playing it. Open it up, try your latest level set a few times, say ""okay, maybe tomorrow"". Within a week I guarantee you'll surprise yourself.The ambience is hilariously tense. I would get halfway through the randomly-generated level sets and my hands would start shaking out of excitement. Failure was inevitable, deserved, and relief for the nerves; and of course, so was success. It's a mesmerizing experience."
