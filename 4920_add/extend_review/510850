76561197968546721,Recommended,510850,33938126,Posted: 31 July,all,ElectricZ,"This is a driving/walking sim, but you're driving and walking on Mars. That's its biggest appeal. If the thought of exploring the Red Planet makes your inner astronaut giddy, M2030 is worth it. If, while checking out a habitat if you spot an odd rock formation in the distance and your inclination is to say ""That looks cool, I wonder what's over there"" you'll like this game. That's the whole game, really. Checking out the marked places on the map, planting flags, and discovering unmarked places to explore using nothing but your eyes, then figuring out how to get your bulldozer sand crawling buggy over there.Other than that there's no real ""game"" to this. No fuel, no water, no resources to gather, no health, no running out of air, no combat, no alien ruins. Just exploration of an open map, getting your buggy hung up on outcroppings, planting flags and collecting samples, learning things along the way.For me, that's what I want in an Astronaut sim. I loved Solus Project because it let me explore an alien world in VR. When I finished the plot, I really wished there was an open ""tourism"" mode that just let me explore the world without worrying about dehydrating or freezeing to death or getting sucked into a tornado. Mars 2030 is that experience and I'm digging it. I'm getting the same vibe while playing it that I do with games like Euro Truck. Crank up some tunes, hop in the rover and watch the sun rise and the shadows crawl across the land. It will probably take 10 or so hours to make the rounds and see all the sites, and as of right now I'm looking forward to the trip.The rover is a ♥♥♥♥♥, though, until you get the hang of it. Then, it's actually fun to drive cross country. But if you don't like it, there's an autopilot to waypoints, or fast travel.Locomotion was also built with flexibility. You have trackpad locomotion with sprinting and jumping. (Bounding around in low gravity is a blast). But if that kind of movement makes you queasy, teleport to your hearts desire with a different button. Your call.(Important note: Roomscale is not officially supported. You can move from your center position and look around things, but you will clip through walls and if you look behind you'll see your body doing some very weird things. Also, if you have a HUD like while in a space suit, it will be invisible until you move back to the center point where it expects your head to be.)The graphics and sound are excellent. I'd put the graphics and VR quality about on par with the Everest VR experience, except that Mars 2030 gives you the freedom to explore the entire map and discover things on your own. I've not seen any popup or texture issues. Everything feels solid and real - well almost. I did clip through the giant wreck of the heat shield that got ejected during landing. But everything else, the habitat, the Mars rover and the terrain are all detailed and convincing. The terrain itself is very well done. No repeating textures or procedural repitition so far. The day and night cycles are beautiful to watch, and getting caught in the open during a dust storm was an appropriately unsettling experience.So - I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a chill exploration simulation or space geeks looking to play astronaut. It's a very polished VR experience far beyond what you'd get in Destinations. But go into it knowing exploration is the only goal - anybody looking for base building, resource gathering or alien life should look elsewhere."

There are some good mechannics like driving the vehicle with a virtual joystick by using VR contollers. That's it. You visit the habitats and read what they are planned for. There is no interaction, no gaming, no mission etc. Even you can't grab objects around you except some rocks on the ground.To me it can be just another VR experince if only it is free if you want to walk around for a few minutes before deleting it. Plus, it cause motion sickness. I already asked for a refund."
76561197997794666,Not Recommended,510850,33964681,Posted: 1 August,all,Tikigod,I was looking forward to this title.  I was disappointed.  It didn't feel scientific at all.  Very basic elementary level learning about first human mission to Mars.   Awkward controls and movements both when walking and driving.  Equipment and interfaces you interact with are very simplified.
76561197980804400,Recommended,510850,33954302,Posted: 1 August,all,Tantalus,"Good educational experience - you'll learn about Mars, plans for manned exploration of Mars, technology, etc.  Unlike most of the other educational VR apps I've seen on Steam, this one actually has a fair bit of content to it:  most I can see/do everything in 15 minutes (or less), but this...well, let's just say that they aren't kidding when they say there's 40 square kilometers of real Martian terrain to explore.  Just don't go expecting anything crazy like alien ruins or a story or anything like that.That said, its biggest weakness is immersion.  You're supposed to be part of the first manned mission to Mars, but once you arrive at the habitat, there are no further goals, the other astronauts don't talk to you (or each other), they're always in the same place doing the same thing, Mission Control sends no further messages, etc.  You're free to come and go from the habitat as you please.  You also do everything solo without even so much as radioing the habitat every once in a while to let them know what you're up to, which is very unrealistic.  I think some banter lines for the astronauts and finding them at different places in the habitat depending on the time of day (or sol, I guess, in this case) could go a long way.  If the devs wanted to really go the extra mile, maybe throw in the occasional random task like solar array repair after a dust devil (surely some excuse could be made as to why the robots couldn't do it) or something.Either way, if you're seriously interested in Mars and/or education in general, this is a good app!"
,Not Recommended,510850,33980213,Posted: 2 August,all,Bed.,"Extremely buggy and laggy. I'd love to experience more of the game but I can't get past the SUPER low frame rate. To me the voice acting is just cringy, if you're already educated in anything related to a space program, this isn't the game for you. They feel it necessary to just spout off info about what's going on. overall, if you're looking for something like ""Take on Mars"" but in VR keep looking, this is more of a virtual hands on classroom. Would not recommend based off it's proformance."
76561198408477898,Recommended,510850,33939365,Posted: 31 July,all,sofisagarcia,"An absolutely stunning game. I tend to get dizzy with any and all VR games, so I hooked it up to my 4k 60"" TV and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ What a magical experience. The landing alone gave me goosebumps that will last for days. The first few minutes of being on Mars are met with tutorials and some basics- I have to say that driving the rover was extremely cool. For me though, the graphics take the cake. Let me explain: Once I finished exploring the habitat- which is awesome by the way- I stepped outside. This is when the real fun began. I started walking around, just checking things out and all of a sudden I received a warning about a dust storm... what followed was the most breath taking thing I've ever experienced.... that oncoming dust storm was G O R G E O U S. I just sat there for a moment and watched it pass by me.. whoa.. I decided I would continue walking around. I reached a mountain peak and  watched. a sunset. on mars. I then proceeded to star gaze. on mars. An absolutely stunning display.Final thoughts: Even without a headset, I felt very much immersed in the landscape and was taken aback way more than I was expecting."
,Recommended,510850,34112107,Posted: 8 August,all,Man Of Steel Man,"Time flies when you are having fun. I've spent eight hours already exploring. Yes there are a few visual glitches and I still can't get the rover to move forward. Right, left, backwards and sideways I can do. Forward just doesn't work for me so it could be something I'm doing wrong. So I've walked everywhere.But it was pleasant though! I walked and explored features that I might have missed simply by driving. By the way, I'm using the HTC Vive with a GTX 1060 video card. To continue: I've found all the flag markings on the map. There are twenty-four (I think) features that aren't though and that's where the exploration really gets fun. I've found four so far so obviously I haven't explored everywhere. The landscape is huge!If you are looking for the feeling of being one of the first explorers on Mars you'll love this. It looks fantastic.It could use a few more things like interaction with the NPCs, and something like a map that one can make notes on for future reference maybe to go back and visit for another look at something that caught your eye before.Anyway, I'm thrilled. Bugs and all, it's a blast for me. I feel like the kid during the Apollo missions dreaming of the day I'd be an astronaut and land on Mars. :)Highly recommended."
76561198191505527,Recommended,510850,33975057,Posted: 2 August,all,Hazmyat,"Always wanted to go to Mars as a child? No? Well this is what I always wanted; and this game has given me what I have always sought as a child: a chance to sit down on the Martian red sand (i.e. my floor, which transformed thanks to VR magic into extraterrestrial terrain), in complete isolation, and watch the sun dawn on the small red planet.In terms of graphics, this game is absolutely spectacular. The superiority of the graphics' quality is complemented by an excellent choice of ambiance sound and, occasionally, music that perfectly go in sync with the scenery in front of you. The science in it is, for the most, accurate and matches with what is being planned for the ongoing Mars colonisation.  Be warned though THIS IS NOT A GAME, at least not in the traditional sense and is still relatively buggy. There is a handful of things to interact with (mostly rocks and the Mars Rover), no two-way conversations and no aliens to shoot. This is an experience for space travel fans who will never achieve their dreams of exploring the cosmos; for those who, like myself, smile while tearing of happiness that they finally got to experience a simulation of what they always wanted.To surmise: Thank you Valve, HTC, FMG Labs and NASA for making my dream come true. Thank you a thousand times. I cannot recommend this game enough."
76561198068202858,Recommended,510850,34382166,Posted: 20 August,all,rpforsman,"This is an amazing experience. You do not need to go to Mars to find out how it looks on the surface. Use this simulation instead. This is how I imagine Mars should look like. I have followed rover exploration on Mars over the years and looked at stereoscopic images using cyan-red glasses and fantasized about being on the surface. Now I can be there. The sun have the right size. The color of the sky is pink or rust colored and not an enhanced blue. Really happy about this. And there is a great area to explore. I bought this game after the 1.1 update and did not have any performance issues. I have a gtx 1080, so I am perhaps not the best person to review this. There are still some issues with this simulation. You are more sensitive to small deviations since this is VR. Shadows sometimes moving with your gaze instead of the angle of the sun, your legs hanging akwardly bent beneath you and hands looking a little twisted. Small things that need to be polished to feel right. Otherwise the scale seem right. And I could bump around in the rover for over an hour without getting sick. It felt right. I use Oculus Rift. The pros are far greater than the cons. Recommended."

Great graphics, great sounds, wonderfull atmosphere.The only thing I miss there so far is some mission checklist, or just some plan what to do. But I spent only about an hour by playing, so maybe I´m wrong. I´m a hardcore simulators player, so I would be happy with full mission start on the Earth, but it´s just a detail.This game is awsome!"

,Recommended,510850,33943004,Posted: 31 July,all,paulohotline®,Sweet baby Jesus I am on mars! Love the intro so far and I look forward to getting deeper into the game. Playing with a 1080TI and the performance needs tweaking by the devs. Will update review as I play more but right now I am loving it. Price is right on for this type of simulation. 7/10 Matt Damon's.
,Not Recommended,510850,34285749,Posted: 16 August,all,jxk46,Game has a bunch of texture issues that messed with my head and ran like garbage even on the lowest settings  (I have a 1070)  I tried going into a cave and exploring but the game just threw a sandstorm at me and then it became night time and I couldn't even see anything. I now feel awful since the framerate was complete bonkers the whole hour I played.
76561197970983304,Not Recommended,510850,34279552,Posted: 16 August,all,EAST,"There's something wrong with the 3D in this game, the image is warped somehow. The game also runs very poorly with constant lag when playing. My computer should be running this fine I believe with a i7 6700k CPU, 1080Ti GPU, 16GB ram and 850 EVO SSD. Barring the technical issues, the game seemed nothing like the high quality beautiful Mission ISS experience from NASA on the Oculus Store, it did not look very good in VR. I tried changing stuff in the video options but to no effect, still very laggy, strange warping effect on image and not very nice looking landscape. I'll change this review in the future if I see updates being pushed to fix my issues. It's too bad, I was looking forward to this experience hoping it would be as good as the Mission ISS Experience. I have asked for a refund."

Your character will hower above mars while you are walking ON MARS (While trying to pick up the flag, my left knee was up like Captain Morgan, and my right foot was howering above martian surface. SUPER CAPTAIN MORGAN - in SPACE!!!). It laged so bad, I could do a 180 degree turn in my helmet before avatar cached up.  Frame rate alone gave me a headache....

If the idea of the mission was a non stop experience to stun the unaware cosmonaut, you got it, guys.. Every step, every mile traveled was a new world for me: the changing colors of the soil, the underground lava, the dust storms, the music, the stones that tell me stories of galaxies whose light may not have reached us. Either on board of the rover or jumping free in the rocky surface, I felt as free conqueror from Earth only intimidated by the strange solitude of the planet. By knowing that all the ships and housing units were I’ve been during the mission, the equipment I handled, the plants I saw in the greenhouses and even the food cans stored in the dining room are not the result of someone imagination, but the product of a long scientific investigation on the dream to reach Mars, made me feel that this a game of reality not a reality game.That’s why I was not expecting a Martian attack as others would like to find in the mission. I didn’t miss a medal as a reward neither a single ammo to be safe and kill enemy creatures. Yes, I didn’t die!. I’m happy to be alive to tell people that this was a fascinating immersion with myself and the universe. Highly recommended"

The game would freeze up early in the tutorial and becomes unresponsive. Thankfully sometime later the devs released a patch for players using AMD hardware. I am editing this review and giving the game a thumbs UP for fixing the issue stability issue which is a make or break factor in the success of a PC game. Also, full screen option has been address by displaying Alt-Enter for full screen on the title screen should the game boot in windows mode. So thanks to the developers for addressing this issue."
