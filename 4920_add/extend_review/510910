The graphics and design are fairly sub-par, but they are still not bad to look at because the lighting is warm. Think UE DK2 2014 quality rendering - it looks good in the mirror/screenshots, but bad in the headset. At the time I played (release), the damn thing crashed on me alot. I probably did that apple puzzle like 7 times. I did complete it though, but that burned me, sorry pal.Beneath the temple, there is a cave, with a skellyton and spiderwebs. The former wears a brown hat signifying a penchant for exploration.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=896713111"

But it's a pretty decent teaser, and it does offer some interesting possibilities with a very classic adventure game style aesthetic going on for the duration.  Given that VR development so far is pretty niche I'm okay paying a little for what's essentially a 10 minute demo.  Just don't expect more than that, and you should have some fun with it."

Stops just as it gets interesting, but unlike the other title that I refunded because of that, this made it plain upfront that it was unfinished - and didn't rush me £15 for it.Good effort, I look forward to this being made a full game.Make the puzzles harder though..."

The temple is interesting, if a bit basic, graphically, and the controls are standard real movement + teleport (my preferred method). However, I was unable to complete the game due to a warning that should be present on all VR games in the future with a particular feature, which is:CONTAINS SPIDERSSeriously, if you are an arachnophobe, it might be best skipping this. I played through A Chair In the Room and loved but, it giant spiders make me nope out of VR immediately. Could not complete for that reason, and likely won't play it again.So, so long as you don't mind big♥♥♥♥♥spiders, give it a whirl."

I'll be showing this to friends who are new to VR. The graphics and sound are nice and I look forward to seeing where this goes. I was hoping someone would come out with an Indiana Jones type of game and this seems to be looking like it might evolve into one. Would be nice to have a whip and pistol."

I would probably buy the actual game on the strength of this, if it ever comes out :)Couple of issues:- Sick-making dropped frames even with GTX 1070 and i7-something. It was workable with reprojection turned on.- The throwing mechanic needs work. Apple direction and velocity were just about random. Very frustrating."

The temple, mountains, waterfalls, caverns, spiders, birds all looked great. The graphics outside are demanding, mine was a little jittery but not too bad after I turned off supersampling.

As it is, it's quite short and outside area is unoptimized (with 1070 I was on reprojection until I got in to a tomb).

,Recommended,510910,25392096,"Posted: 6 September, 2016",all,Harvester of Sorrow,"So this title seemed to have come out of nowhere and was a pleasent experience! For $2 you get a short journey that feels like a awesome combination of Indiana Jones and the Uncharted series and you're tasked in finding a hidden temple.The graphics are gorgeous, probably one of the best visually astounding VR titles I have come across.Gameplay and controls are simple; your basic teleporting, grab and throw, and an automatic flashlight, not a whole lot here.For $2 you have absolutely nothing to lose here. The game itself is short, about 20 min, and ends with a ""To Be Continued"" status, which I would say is the only downside to this game, but again for the price it's nothing to complain about. Temple of the Apsara is perfect for introducing VR to newcombers. I highly look forward to seeing what else comes in from this, felt like a big cliff hanger at the end, hopefully the developers keep us updated in the time to come."

It is an interesting demo of how an adventure game might work in VR with platform jumping, a couple of simple puzzles, a hidden switch, in an attractive setting.   Play with headphones on if you want the full effect of the hissing spiders.   In all I felt it was well worth the small price, and while I would like to have experienced more story the basics are there to build upon."

Then getting the green crystal it crashed. It's pretty much unplayable.As a VR title it also forces you to read which is really straining. Strongly don't recommend
