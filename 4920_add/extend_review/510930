Ding ding ding! Winner! Game is intense and visceral. Within seconds of loading it up I was hitting the deck and blasting choppers and dune buggies to hell.Sound effects are gritty and loud and add to the excitement. Also, the dune buggies chasing the train fly over hills and ramps allowing for some pretty sweet mid-air machine gun kills.My one complaint so far is the grenade grab/throw mechanic is buggy. Overall great game for the price and definitely added to the top of the roster for my next VR party."

Easy reloads, no need to move around. Just find targets and shoot. See a helicopter? Switch to RPG and blow it up.

Especially now that it's 74 cents during steam sale, no reason to even hesitate - the graphics aren't amazing in the vid but when you're in it they work perfectly well. Basically Mad Max kinda stuff, the train goes, you shoot, you save your rockets for helicopters and try not to die.Really good if you have a small room - again, it's not a great game but it's THREE DOLLARS (or when I got it, 74 cents.) Two games in I've gotten my monies worth and I plan to keep playing - yes it's another wave shooter but it's fun, it's easy to explain to people as a demo, and it works.What more do you want, really?"
,Recommended,510930,28635432,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Introitus,Excellent game for the price. I had great fun manoeuvring myself on a moving train shooting enemies down with the various weapons. I was craving some voice acting being a fan of the GTA series. Surprisingly I had no nausea or dizziness playing this title. Looking forward to seeing the refinements the future brings. A multiplayer co-op option would make this the best. Buy this while it's still cheap :)

I don't like on rails shooters, but I love trains and the train-gunner concept works great, even though the track loops its long enough, looks good enough and works well with the combat and enemies.  If the developer keeps working on games of this style, more maps, guns and enemies this game would be well over 2.99, which felt like a steal the first time I played it.  It really felt like moving on train sometimes, which added well, not too slow or fast for a rails.  It got pretty challenging as enemy waves built up, grenades aren't easy to use.  More maps, weapons and enemies and this game could be worth a lot more, hope to see it evolve."

There is so much potential to add weapons to the train or armor to the train or more any type of upgrades to the train. or look at how the iphone game unstoppable: highway truck racing add upgrades to the truck at stations and steal that!Whats great? well everything. the guns are nice and balanced. enemies are varied. difficulty ramps pretty quick. its pretty much perfect. not a 30$ game but a steal at regular price and at discounted price. i feel bad complaining just a little for what you are asking. Great game. thank you!

,Recommended,510930,24812619,"Posted: 10 August, 2016",all,Rafport,"The last update basically it's a brand game, same location but very different performance and details (both are vastly improved). Now the map is noticeable different when you progress. More variations in weapons and enemies.Sure, it could grow more, but I consider the fact devs rewrite almost the whole game as a clear intention to give Thirst a future, instead to abandon the game like many other projects. Very curious to see next steps, but it's yet an interesting (and cheap) game to play."

The post-apocalyptic atmosphere is well done. Going through the town with the helicopters buzzing behind the buildings was awesome!! A little work on the hands and weapon mechanics would be good.. they just felt a little off. I saw that weapon mechanics will be in the next update so that's great news. I didn't have a chance to play the old version so I can't comment on the difference between the two but I can definitely recommend this version. Performance was really good for me but I have a 1080.

Performance and the design of the levels greatly improved and (for me with my low spec system) the game finally really makes fun!The game offers what is seen in the screenshots and video: You are sitting on a train, trying to take cover while shooting (arcade style) at enemies in cars and helicopters. It is fun, but of course it is a rail shooter so you don't get the many hours long fun like from a (surely more expensive) story driven game, but for what it is, it is good and it even provides a leaderboard."

76561197963327589,Not Recommended,510930,33593425,Posted: 16 July,all,Obfuscator,"I paid $0.74 for this game during the summer sale, and if the 14 day limit hasn't elapsed by the time I got around to it, I'd request a refund! Yes, it's that bad.Let's make the obvious comparison to Space Pirate Trainer - the two are very similar. You've got a choice of three types of weapons in your right hand, and a shield (or grenade) in your left hand. Enemies come at you from all around, ground and sky and shoot you until you shoot them down. You can defend shots with the shield. So pretty similar so far, right?No, not at all. While Space Pirate Trainer is a lot of fun, Thirst is just frustration. You can't really aim with any of the weapons, either the iron sights are useless or the projectile velocity is painfully slow (and enemies can be at very long ranges). Your main weapon, an uninspired rifle with a 100-round magazine, cannot be aimed by looking at bullet traces or where it's hit, since both of them are rendered almost invisible and are the same color as the dreary desert background. The other weapons have such long reload times they're not really usable. But that would be okay if your main rifle was half decent.The enemies mostly consist of three types of vehicles and a helicopter repeated ad nauseum. The cars just pop up out of thin air right behind your train, and endless stream of metal on wheels you need to shoot until they catch fire. Again and again. The helicopters aren't any more interesting. They're basically just cars in the air that occasionally shoot a missile. The audio is bad on several levels, the worst is that it completely lacks the ability to give positional hints as to where the enemies are. And to make things worse, they shoot at you and just have no idea where it's coming from. There's no slow motion like in SPT to allow you to react, you just hear the put-put-put sound, and almost no other sound. I find myself looking around to find who's shooting, but sometimes I swear there no one there.There's a simple 100 point health system. You have no idea when you get hit because there's no indication, visual or audible. You don't know when you're low on health unless you keep checking the display that's in your play area. The game just suddenly stops and tell you you've lost, then forcing you to type a name for the leaderboard (empty name doesn’t work) where each button press makes an ear-bleeding sound effect. I quickly learned to lower the volume, type only single letter names, then return the volume to the previous settings, all so I can get to the menu and have another go at the same railway track, with the same enemies and the boring environment.Early access and all... it's just too janky. Get Space Pirate Trainer if you want a similar wave shooter that actually delivers. Other reviewers only recommend this for a dollar or under - I don't."
,Not Recommended,510930,30928547,Posted: 3 April,all,MaizeRage,I believe in the concept of early access and have played my share of early access VR titles. My problem with Thirst is that in its present state April 4th 2017 it is at most a $0.99 game. It is at present a rail shooter (automatically at least a little fun) but very light on content and graphically very unpolished. Some weapons (and there are not many though to be fair I only played through three tries and maybe didn'get further) have no animations and the most basic placeholder effects (looking at you rifle). Will update my review later as I will say it has the potential to eventually be a pretty cool game.

The gameplay is straight forward: shoot everything that comes at you. You are on a train rail car with some minimal cover and have to defend the train from being overcome basically by not dying. The graphics were smooth and good quality for me. Enjoyable game for quick frag fun.

I think maybe that could be changed so the weapon is based on which way you click. I also feel like maybe the UI could use a touch up, to make it easier to spot enemies that may have flipped over and are still but are still shooting at you (Also maybe making the bullet trails more visible would be a nice touch) However, all around it is fun and worth the $1.50 I paid for it."

You can easily find yourself crouching down behind your armored cover that is provided for you and frantically throwing grenades, and using your machine gun over the sides to try to protect yourself, as well as destroy the marauders that are trying to kill you and take over your water train. Game gets more and more difficult as you go on. There are power ups that you can shoot occasionally that will help you stay alive or supp up your weapons. You have a machine gun/rl/and a energy type gun and grenades. If you want a game that you can just jump in and play for a bit of action. this is your game. It's just a blow up everything that comes at you and try outrank others or beat your previous score type of game."

This game is a wave shooters on rail with a very great arcade feeling to it. The physics are over the top which adds to its charm and I personally find enjoyable.If you combined mad max like bad guys with Michael bay explosions and death race into an arcade shooter this would be the illegitimate child of that union.My play through and review can be found here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9asBSkJCxX4This game doesn't feel like it's designed to be a life-like shooter but more of a simple and fun arcade game where you get to experience in the virtual realm.I would like to see more gun options or upgrades such as dual wielding pistols just to change it up a little bit. Also audio control so I can adjust the volume of the music and sound effects separately would be fantastic.Overall a really good game for the price and one I can see myself playing over and over.
