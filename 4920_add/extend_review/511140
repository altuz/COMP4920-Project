,Recommended,511140,25837222,"Posted: 3 October, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"When a strange murder leads Laura James, a journalist working for a secret order, to recognize the murderer as the recently deceased husband of the victim, she never expected to investigate about undeads and the Reaper itself...Third in the trilogy of New York Mysteries, Laura is now dealing with a classic theme: undeads. Before diving into the story, let me just recap the overall plot of the series. Laura is living in New York, in the '50 and is a journalist that was contacted by Mr. Bishop in her first case, with kids and mafia bosses disappearing. The man explained to her the purpose of the secret order he's the guardian: to investigate paranormal cases and to prevent disasters to strike. Thanks to an elaborate subway system, Laura can access the locations where she'll find clues. While she finally found the kids alive, the mafia bosses were indeed taken by a real ghost. On her second case, she was confronted to a man that was executed and reborn into electricity. She was sent by the order to investigate and she wasn't alone anymore as Will appears as a handyman and scientist. Now, she's again sent to investigate a murder and is dealing with another phenomenon: Death itself. The Lantern of Souls is the main artifact of the story and you guess that it has something to do with the Reaper.The story itself is well-written: I mean, I wasn't really expecting the unexpected twist with the Reaper. Besides, it's also nice to come back to other locations but with Will, though he seems a little useless (but you play as him in the bonus chapter). I had just a timing problem: I've forgotten that we were in the '50 and that I wasn't facing a descendant of a German soldier but the German soldier himself. I was even ready to accept him as needing corpses for living so long when in reality, well, he was in the right age at the right era. However, I'm always baffled by the changes in the Order HQ and how the subway system is different each time. In other words, it seems that it keeps expanding (and it's confirmed that new lines are appearing).The gameplay is pretty standard: find items, use them, combine them, clear hidden objects scenes (mostly with shapes and a big scene with at least a puzzle), solve puzzles. I didn't really find any fault in it apart perhaps the maze in the vents - I've read the plan wrongly, I thought that the end was the beginning and even with that fault being corrected, I still managed to loose myself. Also, I found also a little strange that you have to go back to previous locations to advance in the last one for example. It seems a little too much in terms of ""coherence'.As usual, the graphics are good, though I was expecting more flashy colors, given the menu screen, with the Lantern. The locations were also interesting.The soundtrack is marvellous, though I was kinda disappointed that it was the same as the previous game. But as I've liked it, I wasn't bothered by it. It was really fitting.New York Mysteries: The Lantern of Souls is another good game in FIVE-BN's catalogue and I hope to see more about Laura in the future, with more mysteries to solve. Although now, if they can settle on a final design for the HQ, I would be glad, like the subway system, as I missed the original one from New York Mysteries, that was more sci-fi than those now proposed."

From my perspective this is technicallynot a hidden object game because there is no written listof items to find but the logic puzzles are good withoutbeing overly difficult.  Yes I like the game but in thefuture lose the interruption and the rush for prematuregratification."

It felt a bit forced with less detail love than the others and a lot more back and forth and guessing. This is complaining on a high level though. Compared to what we often get offered in the genre, this is still a game worth playing."
