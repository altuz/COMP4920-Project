,Recommended,511350,29833132,Posted: 10 February,all,Spooky THighSPy,"I only had to pay once for these massages.I go home everyday to relieve my stress by shoving a controller onto me and earning a massage from a 2-dimensional werewolf. Sometimes I'm up for a psychopathic alien, and when I'm really stressful I talk to a virtual body pillow.Good dating practice and hard earned massages.Antisocial/10"
,Recommended,511350,29600218,Posted: 30 January,all,Princess Rachel,"Ok, so first of all, I saw Markiplier play this. It looked SO cute and innovative that I had to go straight to Steam and buy it immediately.I do not regret my purchase. This is well worth the £5, and I highly recommend it to everyone.I have not laughed this hard playing a game with such excellent humour in a LONG time.For those of you who don't know, it's like a dating sim, but instead of sex scenes, you get a ""massagy"".That is, you connect a controller to your PC and use the vibration to get a massage on your neck or whatever other part.Each girl whose ""massagy"" you unlock has a different style and feels different, presumably based on what that character's personality is like.Although, I feel they could've worked on making them feel a bit more distinct. After a while, it becomes hard to tell exactly what the different massagy's are supposed to be representing about that character's personality, and frankly the only one I really enjoyed was the ""tutorial"" or ""default"" girl's massagy. Perhaps work on tweaking it a bit, developer, so they feel more unique.It's a fun, clever little game that has a unique mechanic dressed up in visual novel-style dating sim elements.Every character has a surprisingly deep personality & feel for a game that's so simplistic in its presentation, and you really feel invested in getting to know each of them in the short time you have together.It can get a bit frustrating trying to 3-star all the girls (getting 3 stars in each ""date"" grants you a higher-intensity version of their massagy) and a bit more direction or some more hints might be a welcome addition.In general, I would really like to see more characters, and more detailed massagy mechanics to really make each one more distinct.Might also be nice if we could play as a female, optionally. Like a lesbian option that changes dialogue and some images slightly.I'm fine roleplaying as a man, but I would appreciate the option.The game overall is an absolute laugh riot, truly hilarious and seriously clever with its humour, that'll have you in stitches by the end.That is, until...****SPOILER****...until you get to the end credits.Just... why couldn't that be put in a more serious game, developer?I appreciate stories that can play with your emotions well, but come on, in something this silly? Really?As much as I REALLY feel for the developer if that's a true story, now I just feel more depressed than when I started.Still, perhaps that's just a ""me"" thing and I just don't get why it's there; I won't let it spoil my enjoyment of the game. I whole-heartedly recommend this."

,Recommended,511350,28353313,"Posted: 13 December, 2016",all,Jamfrost Jamiro,"Mr. Massagy has a very strange and unique quality to it. It will turn your controller into a massaging device. To access the different massage settings, you must first woo and romance a number of people. That’s right, to massage yourself, you must first prove your worth by being an excellent date. Prepare yourself for comedy and drama, but mostly comedy.Right off the bat, you’ll notice that the game has you using the Linger App on your in-game phone. You can swipe to go through potential dates and select the ones you have enough experience for which is represented by the number of stars you have. The stars are gained from completing dates, pass or fail. Trust me, you’ll want to fail sometimes because the dialogue choices are worth it. You can go through the game’s soundtrack with the phone and check out the leaderboards which are ordered by attained stars. The songs were decent enough that I decided to listen to them for a bit, but I doubt they’ll blow anyone away.Once you start the game proper, you’ll find yourself going on various dates with different kinds of people, well, mostly people. You’ll see. The dating sim aspect is all about finding the best dialogue choices over multiple attempts. That’s it; it’s fairly simple. You’ll end the date with either one, two, or three stars. The dates are where the game gives you the most jokes and some of the dialogue can be pretty funny and self-aware. You can date a Mayonnaise jar or a wolf girl which are some of the funnier encounters. Make sure to do your best so you can unlock the three-star massage which is more intense than the two-star ones.So yeah, the game will access your controller’s motors and make them do things I’ve never felt or heard before. Now the game says you can massage the neck or other places with the controller. Just make sure to clean up after you’re done. What’s neat is that each date unlocks a massage setting that relates to them in some manner. Some massages are better than others for the neck such as The Sloppy Hand or Mamma’s Jell-O. Be aware that the motors will be working harder than in other games.It’s not a long game, but maybe people will use it more for massaging purposes as perfecting the dates should only take around an hour. I paid $5 (after card sales) for it which felt fair when I remember how much I laughed. There’s also the promise of future content, but I don’t know if those additional dates will be free.I had a good time with Mr. Massagy. Rumble away those painful areas with a soothing massage. If you don’t care about the massaging aspect and are just curious, wait for a sale so that you don’t overpay for the short amount of gameplay."

I wanted a goofy game to play to cheer me up and this game delivered. I really liked the variety of the girls, and the interactions between them and Muscles McAbs(Which is what I am calling him.)The OST is beautiful, and also gives a variety for each locale and girl. I laughed until I cried playing this game. Now, I used my ps4 controller, and it worked to play the game, but the massage function didn't seem to work. During the massage times  it would say that no controller was detected. I don't know what the deal was, since it worked fine otherwise. But I didn't particularly care because I enjoyed the rest of the game so much,9/10 cause I couldn't get my massage"

If you are one of those people who like to troll the love interests that are in games like this then Mr. Massagy is the game for you. Don't expect any real depth with this game though, just turn off your brain, and embrace the weirdness, and whacky humor. 10/10 would troll Waifu again."
76561198364359946,Recommended,511350,29663254,Posted: 2 February,all,dancingdingo,"A very cool concept that's executed very well, although it feels lacking in the relationship department.  Definitely a fair price for what you get.  Personally, I think that the idea of adding another sense for a video game to stimulate is actually pretty f'ing creative.  You get a touch sensation, alongside your usual visual and audial sensations.  I played with a Xbox One controller, and, putting the sorta awkward shape of the controller aside, I was really surprised by how genuinely relaxing it was.  Of course, I may as well note that one could get more creative than placing it on the neck or back.  'Nuff said.Honestly, I'd like to see more relationship development with the girls, as opposed to more girls themselves.  Right now, you go on a date with someone, and unlock different massages depending on how well the date goes (which dialogue options you choose).  Which, as I said, is 100% fair and worth it for six bucks, but it feels like you just meet them and forget about them.  The problem is that if you don't want to forget about one, and want to go back and see more of them, it's just the same date again.Overall though, this game is, I think, a great proof of concept, and really neat gem to pick up for how cheap it is.  Just needs more content - I wouldn't even mind if I had spent $15 on it if it had actual relationship building/progression."

Its pretty entertaining, though there is something that the developers didn't point out in the ""Which controllers does the game support"" part of the description, or at least probably werent aware of.If you have a rockcandy xbox 360 controller, I advice not to buy this game. The reason is, as I found out after buying the game, rockcandy controls do not have the vibration feature in them, meaning you won't be able to enjoy the game the way its suppose to.
