,Recommended,511470,32965275,Posted: 28 June,all,Excuritas,"[Introduction]I would like to start this review with saying that I’m usually not really into puzzle games, let alone games with actual puzzle pieces, the majority of those are just boring to me. But this one seems to be special, it just hit me when I saw the trailer and screenshots; I guess the aesthetic and audio just spoke to me.As in all my reviews, these are my own opinions and experiences, please check out other reviews too![Negatives/Suggestions]Puzzle pieces are slightly larger when you pick them up, this can result in frustration and confusion when you just can’t find the right spots. Some keys or arrows would’ve been nice to turn the piece tray without the needing to grab it. Spinning it happen often accidentally when you just want to grab a piece.Having to pick up the pieces in order to see the colors can be a bit tiresome if you’re looking for distinct colors, an option to at least slightly see the color would be cool. The game is simply too short and can be finished in around 3-4 hours which was a bit disappointing; I was hoping for more. New puzzles as DLC or a sequel would be great. An option to show solved puzzles in fullscreen without any UI elements would’ve been a nice add to create pretty screenshots or even wallpapers.[Gameplay]Just what you would expect from a jigsaw puzzle game. Picking up the puzzle pieces to drop them in the right spot to complete the whole picture. There is no time or move limit so this adds to the relaxing atmosphere of the game. What makes it different is that no piece is the same, each one has a different shape and size and the overall puzzle shape varies widely as well.While most of the game is rather easy, some specific puzzles can be quite challenging; one of them took me 20 minutes to beat it. There are 25 unique puzzles in 25 different countries related to events that happened in said countries. It was fun to guess the picture while getting closer to the reveal.[Graphics/Art]This right here is a unique mix of majestically fitting menus mixed together with beautiful stained glass artwork. The whole game is just so mysterious and colorful that it tends to mesmerize you pretty much the whole time. Artworks are based on the specific countries history and pretty much all of them are just a pleasure to look at.[Music]A soundtrack fitting the mysterious nature of the game is also included and helps greatly with creating a relaxing atmosphere. Each section of earth has a proper song with instruments unique to that zone, doing a great job of conveying the part of earth you are currently in.Checkout the composers website for a preview![Conclusion]With 3-4 hours playtime, the price is justified in my opinion and this is certainly a pleasure for people who enjoy those kind of games with the added bonus of this also being very relaxing and fun. I recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the game just based on the screenshots and people who are interested in jigsaw puzzle games.For now, it’s the the best jigsaw puzzle game I’ve ever seen. The authentic and artistic combination of instrumental music and stained glass art is just too lovely!Enjoyed this review?

The idea is very simple; explore the world via puzzles. That's it, and it's fine the way it is.Gameplay...It was both challenging and rewarding. There were varying difficulties, from three to five - and five being the most challenging. The puzzles had different shapes, which made some of them quite difficult. They certainly were different from normal rectangle ones, for instance.There was also this interesting trick. Depending what route you went, you could come across puzzles with the difficulty rate being five. After finishing it and unlocking the next, that puzzle's difficulty could be four. I actually ended enjoying that, since I could test my skill and then relax a bit more with a more easy puzzle.Art...The art was really pleasant to look at. As I don't know much about stained glass art, I'm not sure if they are ""real"" or just made for the game. Either way, they were pretty and I even learned some history from them.Music...At first, it annoyed me. The music itself didn't sound bad, but my focus drifted because of it, especially if the puzzle was hard. After I finished the last five puzzles, the music didn't bother me at all.Conclusion...It's a nice, short game that can offer either challenge or relaxation. There's no time limits, so there's no need to rush to get that one achievement. You might learn new things from playing the game. However, I think the price is just a bit too high for a game that will take two to three hours to finish. Unless you buy it on sale."

,Recommended,511470,30828983,Posted: 30 March,all,Igor the Viking,"We need more games like this one.Casual, fun, relaxing, beautiful. I finished the whole game in one session. There are very few good games in the jigsaw style out there, this is absolutely one of the (if not THE) best.What could be improved:- pieces are slightly larger than their ""slot"" when you are holding them on top of the board, and this can be confusing- snap box could be a little bit bigger- other way to control the dials (like arrow keys) to avoid turning the dial when you want to grab a pice and grabbing a piece when you want to turn the dial- show graphics on the pieces while on the dials (at least with a 50% opacity filter)- option to turn spin animation on / off."
,Recommended,511470,26699719,"Posted: 19 November, 2016",all,Rachel#SendMeYourUnwantedCoupons,This game is really beautiful and very well made. I am impressed. It doesn't take long [as stated by the dev - I also finished 5 of the 25 puzzles in half an hour] and it's not particularly difficult but it is very entertaining. I'm really enjoying it. It's very casual and relaxing. Paid full price and I believe that it's totally worth by the experience the game offers. Do hope the dev makes a sequel because this one surely deserves it. Highly recommended. 10/10.
,Recommended,511470,33057754,Posted: 30 June,all,Blattdorf,"This was my hidden gem of the 2017 Summer Sale. It gave me that Pandora's Box vibe that I've longed to feel, since that old puzzle game had a charm of relaxing discovery that no game has come close to recreating, to say nothing about surpassing it. I wish someone would make a spiritual successor already...Still, my double thumbs-up comes with a few caveats (don't let them dissuade you from playing the game!).First of all, the art style can sometimes be detrimental to the game. There are rare times when the sheen and colour composition can make it difficult to discern which spaces are empty and which are not. It's not bad, more like a little too much of a good thing, maybe.Secondly, the clock-like play area wasn't such a hot idea in retrospect. Each puzzle has you place stained glass fragments within a given clock-like object - a novel idea, but it feels a bit forced and constraining. It doesn't really add anything to the game other than making the play area even more visually busy than it already is.Finally, the puzzle mechanics don't seem to lend themselves to increased scope. I realize the puzzles were intended to be solved blind with a small number of pieces, but I imagine solving anything with more pieces could be an exercise in frustration. These stained glass puzzles lend themselves to unorthodox pieces composition, so there is some potential there for unique puzzle-solving experiences.Despite all of the above nitpicks, I wholeheartedly recommend the game to any puzzle afficionado in search of something relaxing and a little off the beaten path. I'm looking forward to what the devs cook up next."
,Recommended,511470,28738275,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,Zedd's dead,"This game is a classic jigsaw puzzle game. I would certainly recommend it, but at a discount. Here is the practical breakdown:CONS:1. The game is too easy and short. No piece rotation and odd boarder shapes made it not challenging2. There are no difficulty settings, so you can't make the puzzles harder by having it broken into more pieces3. Pieces do not exactly match the openings they fit in. If it kinda looks like it fits, try it.4. The pieces are in rings that spin. This is more annoying then helpful and sometime the wheels spin on one side and not the other to reveal other pieces you did not know were hiding.PROS:1. Absolutely beautiful. I would actually love to have a time piece that looked like some of these.2. The shapes of the pieces were also interesting making the game more engaging.3. The music was relaxing and changed from location to location to prevent it from being too repetitive4. Puzzles were stylistic representations of something having to do with the country they are for as did some of the music***RECOMENDATION***1. In the settings for the game, make sure you deselect the starting clues. The game was already too easy. I cannot imagine how much faster it would have been with help.All in all, I really enjoyed the experience of piecing these beautiful artistic works together. If you are in the mood for something quick and visual, this is it."

Although it has different difficulties the Puzzles are never to hard and wont take longer them approximatlly 15 Minutes (per super hard puzzle).I personally am a big Fan of Jigsaw Puzzles like Pixel Puzzles however Pixel Puzzles just doesn't have the same atmosphere and gorgeousness of this Game. I was rather surprised how different those 2 were.The only thing I saw as negative is that there were far to less Puzzles and I would off liked to see more.Personally I really loved and enjoyed this Game every little bit and I wish that Onyx Lute would make another Game like this, although they are an Indie Studio.I also would love to see a Soundtrack available for purchase, as I wasnt able to find it anywhere on youtube.I do recommend this Game to any achievement Hunter as it is not very Hard to complete it, but unlike the zup games you actually get a proper gaming experience here.I also do recommend this Game to any Puzzle Fan.In general I would like to mention that you should try this Game out as it really is in my eyes very underrated and underplayed for how amazing it is."

Not only are the puzzles themselves absolutely beautiful, as well as being challengine yet doable, with wonderful gameplay that avoids much frustration, but the music is just as veries and beautiful.This game is worth every penny, and will give you several hours or more of good entertainment, with a wonderful soundtrack.I'm hoping a sequel (or more) will be made.Here's some advice to improve the sequel. This does not at all take away from this wonderful game:There should be less ""small"" pieces, and ehenever you're placing a small piece, the areas where you can place this pourpiece in the puzzle, should be clearer.I'm especially talking about when you're placing that one last piece, and it's small.Second, when you're holding a piece to place, make that piece slightly brighter than the others.And try to release the soundtrack outside the game if possible.This is one of the best puzzle games to come out recently!"

It's art-deco aesthetic is absolutely stunning and with it's soothing soundtrack, you can get lost for a few hours completing the puzzles.The basic mechanics are easy and simple, just pick up pieces and have them match up inside the stained glass clock.There are a few issues however:- Sometimes the area where you pick up puzzles will just randomly spin out of control when you try and drag a piece. Strange but can be overlooked, even if it's annoying.- The pieces will fit in awkwardly and don't appear to fit in. You'll see if you play it.It's a nice game and worth a buy."

,Recommended,511470,26705811,"Posted: 19 November, 2016",all,Fenrakk101,"A short and simple game, but also very pretty and satisfying. At its core, Glass Masquerade is a basic jigsaw puzzle game, but the stained glass aesthetic really makes this game stand out. If you think you would enjoy the game, you will probably enjoy the game.The only significant problem the game has is that the pieces overlap a bit on the board. This means that, if a piece is supposed to fill a small gap, that gap might not even be visible on the board because of the other pieces filling it in a bit. it's something you'll get used to by the end, but do bear it in mind if you play the game yourself."
,Recommended,511470,34576847,Posted: 29 August,all,IFIYGD,"Wonderful, casual jigsaw puzzle game, I highly recommend it for anyone who loves doing jigsaws.Not going to do the usual ratings scale. No point. It's a 10, for me at least. Your Mileage May Vary, depending on how you feel about jigsaw puzzle games. This one is the best one I have seen. Ever.The art is stunning for fans of stained glass, or those who appreciate fine arts.The music is quite relaxing, appropriate and soothing. Very nice audio here.Runs smooth as melted butter, on a n old toaster.Puzzles are not too difficult, but not too easy either, due to the blind piece style used. You can add a touch more challenge by turning off the first piece highlighting that lets you see and snap the first pieces to predetermined dots on the puzzleboard. I did this, and played slowly, 5.7 hours for my first playthrough.You cannot see unplaced pieces until you pick them up, which I like. The game does auto-rotate pieces to their correct orientations for placement, which some may find helpful. I would have like having this able to be turned off and manual piece orientation needed, but no gamebreaker. It was challenging enough to find the correct blank shapes to choose to flip over and fit into the open spaces. Kept my brain active while I played, and kept me engaged. The piee count per puzzle is not high, but the random shapes of the pieces along the stained glass lead-lines kept it from being too simple. Might be a bi frustrating for young kids or folks with ADHD or OCD- for real. I can see this game p being either good therapy for either condition, or a potential problem for those who suffer from either.I bought this on sale, and it was more than worth the sale price of $2.99 USD. Full price of $4.99 USD is worth it, and I would have been just as happy if I had paid tha amount.Replayability? For me, yes. I feel that it has that. No time penalties, but it does record your time to complete each puzzle. And I want to o back and beat my first times. Even without the time recordingds, I know I will play this again just for the beautiful art and music, and for the stress relief and relaxation it provided.A very nice, quality offering from an apparent first time Indie studio. I look forward to seeing what they offer next."

76561197977113475,Recommended,511470,31512508,Posted: 2 May,all,frances,"This was a lovely, if brief, puzzle game. I started playing thinking the images would be created from pictures of stained glass creations from all over the world, but it appears that they are all original artwork representative of the various peoples and places. (DLC idea?) The odd shapes that align with the natural divides between pieces of glass add a kinesthetic challenge more complex than the experience of traditional jigsaw-shaped pieces. It was fun to see how often I could see where a piece belonged before clicking on it so it would auto-rotate to the correct orientation, and how often an obvious fit would elude me until I did.As I see others have noted, the pieces look larger before you place them in the puzzle, which often means they don't look like they will fit. I suspect that this might be intentional, with the solder between the glass pieces being represented both in the pieces already placed and in the loose pieces. It's something that I quickly got used to and was only a significant source of confusion in my first puzzle, but one which I periodically had to consciously compensate for all the way through. I think it has to do with the way the brain interprets shapes as ratios of, say, length to width, while the extra size given to the pieces before their placed does not seem to be proportional. This means that the piece that fits into an opening may seem a lot less ""spindly"" than the opening itself.8/10 Would consider buying a DLC and will almost certainly replay the existing levels at some point.Minor issues directed more at the devs than the players:I never got the hang of where to click and hold if I want to rotate the unplayed pieces vs where to click and hold to pick up a piece. All the way to the end of the game I was making that error. The hit box for the pieces is larger than the pieces, and the hit box for the inner ring seems to extend into the inner edge of the outer ring. Maybe a grip strip would help clarify?Early in each round, as you rotate the supply of pieces, the mirrored pieces on the other side of the board rotate along. It took me a little while to realize that each ring was not a single supply of pieces, but that the left and right side of each ring were separate sets of puzzle pieces cycling separately even as they looked like they were cycling together.On several levels there were pieces of glass dark enough that it wasn't easy to see which parts of the board were unplayed space and which were not. Canada was one where, when placing the final piece, it looked like there were still a few openings and I placed the last piece based on shape. It's a minor thing, but a distinct backdrop texture could allow a better ability to compare shapes without limiting the palette of the final images.The game reacts a little oddly to an accidental right click while dragging a piece. The piece gets returned to the unplayed supply out of place. The worst effect was when it was placed on top of another unplayed piece, and I could only pick up one of the two. There are no situations in the game where a particular piece has to be played before the other, so once I played the piece that I could pick up I was able to play the other."

My only issue with it is that once you complete it, there isn't much incentive to play the game any further.

Ranging from about 5 minutes, to about 30 minutes, the puzzles are visually stunning, and made me think about picking up stained glass classes just to make one or two of the featured clocks!This game is very meditative, and the music adds to it, making for a mind quieting, peaceful and beautiful experience.

I have to say, this game didn't disappoint me like a few other bargains did. Essentially, it's a glorified jigsaw puzzle game, with each country (25 countries total, I think) having a puzzle of their own you must complete. The image pertains to something about the country, such its past, tourist attractions, etc.After you complete each artpiece you are taken back to the map to pick your next destination. The game isn't entirely linear, as you have a path you can follow, which branches off to various countries and regions. You can choose whatever direction you'd like, or even backtrack to another area. Also, each puzzle is rated in difficulty from one to five, so you'll have an idea of how long it will take.To boot, getting the achievements is easy. You get one for each country you complete. So, if you're looking for a 'perfect' game, with all achievements completed, then this one may pique your interest.The game has soothing music, which sometimes varies according to where you are in the world. And, the visuals are really nice. The game overall is very relaxing, even when doing the most difficult puzzles.Really, the only con about this game, which is minor, is that the pieces are just a bit larger when you pick them up, which makes finding the right spot sometimes slightly more challenging.Overall, I recommend this game, especially if you love beautiful visuals, art, country related themes, jigsaw puzzles, and/or something casual to unwind with."

I've spent a lot of time playing this on my laptop while waiting for appointments, airport layovers, or just trying to fall asleep.There's a few issues with the game that don't necessarily need fixing, but they do take some getting used to, if you're accustomed to putting together table-top puzzles.  The edges of the puzzle pieces overlap in ways that often make it look like a piece you're holding is too big for the space where it belongs.  Unplaced pieces are only shown as silhouettes.  You can't see what color they are, or their actual size until you're holding them.  Unused pieces snap back to their original place on the wheel when you release them, so you can't group them with similarly colored pieces.If they release more puzzle packs as DLC, I'd be happy to continue supporting this one."

It looks great and gameplay works rather well. Some small problems like the pieces not always being the correct size until you put them in the right place which can be confusing. Some other problems are that none of the puzzles can be considered large or complicated. But it's relaxing and good for when you only got half an hour to spend on a game. I got say the price is a bit on the high side for amount of time it takes to finish but I can't say that I feel in anyway ripped off. But if you can get this on a sale then it's certainly worth a buy.

I figured it'd be a nice puzzle game when I wanted to waste some time and it's perfect for that. I haven't played it all the way through, but it seems fairly short over all, which saddens me because the puzzles are beautiful and the theme is really nice. I love that the clocks are in different shapes, and you can spin the 'wheels' on the side with the pieces to find one you want. Also really like that the pieces are just shapes until you select them to try them, and then the color/pattern is revealed. It's a very relaxing game and I found myself just wanting to continue and put them all together. I made myself stop though, to save some for another time.Overall the puzzes, even when ranked 'difficult' aren't terribly hard. Some def make you think longer and mess with the pieces, but they're all doable and nothing is so exasperating that you can't manage it. I also liked trying to figure out what the picture was as it was taking shape.  I really hope they come out with more like this, since it's really a very beautiful and relaxing puzle game."

76561197979348554,Recommended,511470,33619915,Posted: 17 July,all,columbine,"This is a pretty good jigsaw game. It has a number of oddities which will either frustrate you or add some difficulty, depending on your point of view.First, you can't see what the pieces actually look like until you drag them around. Second, you can't fit pieces together unless you're actually placing them on the grid, so (because the pieces are hidden unless you're dragging them around), the puzzles sometimes take on a bit of a memory-game aspect. ""OK, this piece is one of the bird's wings, I know I saw another one which was the mirror image of that somewhere, now where was it ..."" Third, the outlines of the pieces dont always match the spaces they fit into in the puzzle very well.I felt all of these things added difficulty, and that this was good because the puzzles are not especially hard.One quirk of the game is that the ""dials"" that display the pieces don't work the way you might expect them to. Although it looks like there's an inner dial and an outer dial, the sets of pieces you're rotating through on the left and the right sides of the dial aren't the same. That is, there are actually four sets of pieces to scroll through, it's just that often two of them scroll at the same time.The game is pretty short - I took my time, doing a couple of puzzles a night in a leisurely way, and it lasted me about four hours. If I'd done it all in a single binge it probably would have taken me two."

,Recommended,511470,34622956,Posted: 30 August,all,Pogo,"Beautiful puzzles, beautiful music, beautiful interface.I often find myself looking at jigsaw-style puzzle games in the Steam store, and I always end up passing on them for one reason or another.I don't remember when I first saw Glass Masquerade, but I couldn't recall the premise when I saw it again on my wishlist. I visited the store page, took a look, and immediately bought it and played through the whole thing essentially in a sitting. It's a series of 25 puzzles of varying complexity, unlocked 1 or 2 at a time through branching paths.Part of the game control disappointed me at first: Although yet-unused pieces freely rotate while they rest in the selection area, they automatically snap into the correct orientation as soon as they are dragged into the puzzle board area. I was expecting the pieces to require rotation, with either 4 or 8 possible orientations, but no flipping backwards. It's also a little strange to me that yet-unused pieces sitting in the selection pool are blacked out in silhouette. I guess being able to see the colors might be too much of a giveaway, even though the stained-glass aesthetic means color isn't always a good hint.Another complaint I have is that sometimes the intended location of a given piece seems impossible or is easy to miss. Pieces held by the player are slightly larger than the space they will occupy on the board (not sure if this was meant to imply perspective relative to the puzzle board), and pieces on the board have shiny lines bordering them. If you need to place a piece with a narrow branch sticking out of it, you might not be able to see where it belongs because the ""branch"" portion may appear to be covered up by the overlapping borders of other pieces. I'm not sure if this is a resolution issue or what.Even with those minor gripes in mind, I enjoyed the game and I wish there was more. I guess maybe after some time passes I can replay it as if it was new.Haski / 10"
