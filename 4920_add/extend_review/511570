That being said it is nothing like Xortex.. it is a different style of game.  Nightstar is a scrolling shooter, Xortex is a room scale shooter.That being said this is a fun arcade game that I plan on playing a lot more.As I play more I find my ship getting hit by dimly lit objects that are very difficult to see..  Hopefully in the future this gets updated.I give this a positive review because it is worth a play if you buy a lot of games.  I rarely purchase games... If I had the chance to demo this game before buying I would have spent my money on a different game."

So far this is one of my favorite VR games.  It's pretty basic arcade gameplay.  No intricate upgrade systems or any fancy attempts to add rougelike elements.Just straight up FUN♥♥♥♥♥gameplay.  For anyone who played with toy spaceships as a kid who wants to actually fly one around in space shooting bad guys, THIS is the game to pick up!I've heard it compared to a couple other titles, but personally haven't found anything that hit the spot like this game.It's a unique design that doesn't try too hard to be different.  Great sound and music, and very satisfying imagry with plenty of explosions in space.  I expected to like this game after playing the demo, but I didn't expect to enjoy it THIS much.   I grew up loving everything about the space/sci-fi genera and always imagined I'd need to be flying first person, in the cockpit to get this much enjoyment out of a space shooter, but the truth is I like this better than any other space shooters in VR that I've played so far.What's even cooler is you can download a demo to try it out for yourself before buying.  I personally payed $14.99 for it durring Steams Winter sale, and I'll be completely honest I don't even regret paying more than the current price.  One reason for that is that one of my motion controllers was broken for about a week and a half so having a game I could play with one controller saved me a ton of grief for those 9 days (felt like a couple months) before deciding I could just fix the thing myself.That's all beside the point.  Try the demo, if you like it even a little it's definitly worth the current price for the amount of enjoyment you'll get from it.  Not to mention it's decent workout dodging all that incoming fire.  Just keep your chaperone on or you'll be tempted to chase a powerup through a wall."

It's more similar to Crystal Nebula minus the maze.Initially after seeing the video, I was not too impressed.  But the gameplay is much better than I thought.  The enemies wave are different each time.  They are randomly generated.   One feature I like the most is that you can regain your health by picking up powerups.It was confusing at first how the level and powerup works.  I died often without knowing how I got shot.  It is quite addictive.  I just bought the game today and I played almost 2 hrs.  Actually I am going back in very soon."

I got to top 50 on my third attempt. Of course my leaderboard position doesn't affect my enjoyment, but for 5-10 minutes while playing with plenty of powerups and killing the boss over and over I felt like nothing was changing and I wasn't being challenged.- Felt like the game required me to raise my controller above my head to best avoid getting hit. This made my shoulder hurt.- It's fairly hard to aimIn conclusion: Get it on sale and see if you like it more than I did."

76561198292942076,Recommended,511570,31421697,Posted: 28 April,all,rsformatc,"This is what VR is about!! After getting a Vive 2 weeks ago I have been sampling many games but I kept going back to Xortex as it was the most immersive and most fun. I was wondering why there aren't other games like that. I was pleased to find that another developer has noticed this as well and has done something about it. Nightstarr, although in its infacy, is engaging, addictive, challenging and above all immersive! Well done to the developer, I hope you get the recognition you deserve and inspire other developers to follow suit. I look forward to seeing how Nightstar develops further!!"

76561198030765814,Recommended,511570,25311984,"Posted: 2 September, 2016",all,Kaaihn,"Yep, this is a keeper.  Tried the demo, bought the full game after two plays.  This is completely different than any other VR game I've played so far, in that it isn't really first person.  It's more third person, with one controller being the ship.  It moves wherever you move the controller, pretty much instantly.  It's really easy to just stand in one spot and just wave the controller around, but this is a room scale game.  Walk around to get better angles, or dodge thick packs of things that are coming from one area, etc.  Awesome game, lots of replayability.My one complaint would be how long it takes to reset after game over.  I want to click through whatever scoring it's showing me and just restart immediately, but it makes me wait ~20 seconds and then brings the menu up to allow a new game."

I honestly can't even tell you if I just walked back in because I was having too much fun. You don't have to watch for thing coming from behind you (so you don't get wrapped up in your cord spinning circles constantly looking for stuff) and it's more like flying through space then blasting stuff in an arena. honestly in my opinion the two biggest flaws of xortex. Can't recommend enough. if you liked xortex. this is actually better enough to be worth the 15 bucks. I'm probably buying my friend a copy for his vive, that will be a first for a non multiplayer game. it's that good."

,Recommended,511570,29233385,Posted: 13 January,all,Wasted Potential,"Nightstar is very much like The Lab's Xortex, but different in enough ways as to merit being a seperate game.  That said, if you like Xortex, you'll certainly like Nightstar. It is very much the standard, controller becomes spaceship, shooter game but it adds powerups, wingmen, and even objectives (protect fleeing spaceships) to the mix. While one can say it is repetive, etc... having grown up on Galaga and classic games ike that, I get that a good game does not have to be deep or long in content to be enjoyable. Sometimes simply being a shooter game can be good. Thankfully the developer has added constant firing as an option to save your controller from the beating it would take otherwise. Overall, this is one Vive game that I find myself going into for a quick game often. It is also one I use to demo the Vive to people with since it is so straight forward and reminds one of old school arcade games. Therefore I highly recommend it to everyone as a VR library addition."

,Recommended,511570,25066655,"Posted: 21 August, 2016",all,aiware,"Super fun game! The feeling of traveling through space is awesome, and because of the static background and steady velocity, works well without any dizziness whatsoever. The difficulty is perfectly balanced between too easy and too hard, making it very satisfying to actually get to the next level. The intensity of the game seems to pick up as you get upgrades, so it's always a challenge to keep your ship in top shape (you lose some upgrades when you're shot). The game works well for any-heighted people (even kids!).There are a few annoying things that will probably get cleaned up in time by the developer. For instance, there's no way to exit the game except from within the VR headset (you lose mouse control once the game goes full screen and takes over the monitor). I look forward to seeing further updates!"

Imagine an old school style shooter like Silpheed (yes, I really am that old) dragged into the 21 century and now in full 3d, and you've pretty much got Nightstar.Pro's: Extremely addictive, challenging and rewarding gameplay. Awesome use of the 3d effect that makes you feel like you're flying through a miniaturised space battle.Con's: Made my trigger finger hurt."

Absolutely brilliant use of room scale too, start at the front of your play space and find yourself pressed to the very back of it, by the end of the game.This one has great potential.Wishlist? A few more music tracks and the option to turn off the grid effect on the roof."
