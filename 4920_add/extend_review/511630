As sometimes when you explain it or try to imainge it its so veryed and diffrent its hard too capture in words. As i think its a much more visual thing so the way its show is stunning!So yes...-Good art!-Oringal Score (Witch i am loving so far)-RP maker combat that has oringal enemys and attacks!On the Flip side one minour thing that is feed back more then not recommendations!-Buggy from time too timeBut apart from that i think its another asome way too spread the word and creativity and the world from a diffrent view! It's a hard thing to capture and i feel this game thus far has succsseded!
,Recommended,511630,29428240,Posted: 22 January,all,The Red Praetor,"As someone diagnosed with ADHD as a child, and with several friends who have Asperger's, I can related to this game. You play Max, a 10 year old child with high functioning autism. Your job is to get through the day's challenges, such as getting dressed, making it through school, playing with friends, doing homework, and weathering a thunderstorm.The gameplay is standard for games made with RPG Maker. You have turn-based combat, items, spells, and experience levels. The real charm of the game is not the gameplay, but how you see the world through an autistic child's eyes. For that reason alone, this game is worth the investment."

Max must be very proud of himself and his Pops for making a creative and lovely game. :)(note: i have not finished it yet but i couldn't help myself recommending this to others because i really enjoy it. plus i'll update once i've finished the story.)

I decided to purchase the game predicated upon it's unique subject matter.  This game is extremly well thought out and put together nicely.  You spend a day in the life of Max, where you partake in various adventures in the form of mini games and treading through imaginary lands.  You can not help but have a smile on your face when playing this game.I have played quite a bit of RPG Maker games and this game stands all on its own.  This was a breath of fresh air in the smog of churned out games in this category."

That's this game.The only part that sucks is autism is a really edgy topic due to it being demonized by idiots on games like ""counterstrike global offensive"", and its a serious topic.This is a well done game in my opinion (if you dont know about autism), but it may be like one of the many games that I'm working on where it should stay on a hard drive and not seen or publicised out of respect.I think I can post this without voting positive or negative, but if i have to choose, I'll give it a thumbs up."

,Recommended,511630,32244187,Posted: 7 June,all,DescX,"This simple yet unique RPG lets you see the world through Max' eyes: daily obstacles are monster bosses, little challenges are dangerous quests and small fears become scary nightmarish monsters.Warning: near the end, when you look for batteries, you’ll get some jumpscares. But only then.Luckily, there’s this Dad of the Year with all these helpful picto’s, some earmuffs and a flashlight. Pretty normal for us, but all these things mean the world to Max.The overall style is very cozy and personal, because it’s made by Max’ dad (yes everyone in this game is based on Max and his family, and all experiences are based on his too). Like I said, Dad of the Year!As someone who’s worked with children with ASD, I must say that this is a nice way to either learn about ASD or teach others about it. In my oppinion, it's even useful as aserious gameor something to add to psychoeducation for kids. The picto’s come with personal yet useful information about that special brain. I recommend it!"

,Not Recommended,511630,26110222,"Posted: 18 October, 2016",all,Iyamtebist,"It is important for autistic people to know that they are much more than their disorder. Autistic people are individuals each with their own thoughts and their own hopes and dreams. The same cannot be said for this game. Max an Autistic Journey never tries to be anything more than “a game about autism” and its premise is its only notable quality. It does not even try to do anything interesting with its premise, and the only thing that it accomplishes is that you can learn a bit about autism from playing it if you are interested.While Max does tell you about what autism is, it does not do so in an interesting way and is not a game I feel I could recommend for fun, and all I can think about with this game is how things should be different. Max an Autistic Journey could have been great if tried to go beyond its own premise and tried to speak to people as a whole. It is clear that Stephane's heart was in the right place while making this game and that there was passion put into it. This unfortunately does not change the end result. In fact, it just makes things all the more sad.Full Review Herehttp://www.gamefaqs.com/PC/194366-max-an-autistic-journey/reviews/163187"

,Recommended,511630,25204327,"Posted: 28 August, 2016",all,Strawberry Cream Cake,"This is a very nice game to play. It is about Max and about his day as a autistic kid. In this game, he will be confronted with different problems and issues and there are also things about anxienty and high sensitivy. The entire game is a mix from dialogues, to follow the story (there are also a few hidden references to movies), those neat windows with trivia about autism, that explains it and the biggest part of the game are the RPG like Turn Based matches. I forgot to mention, that there are also some Quizes and some things, that you have to find out on yourself.My hint: By the Lego island thing, where you have to travel, DO NOT go into the middle island, that is red, because if you do, without collecting all parts from the islands around it, you will stuck in limbo and you have to restart the savestate.I recommend this also to everyone, who not only have Autism, it is also for every HSP and people with sensory overload problems, because this game contains a subject, that combines everything in one and where did you saw a game like that, that mentions this subject in a videogame?(I also have to say, that almost all of the random crashes caused by a lack of Memory. I upgraded to 4GB and now the game almost never crashed.)"

It is informative, hopeful and fun. Awesome story and very important information that is being brought across in a nice way. But sometimes the game design lacked a bit. Some bugs here and there... Most annoyingly though: very hard boss battles that followed no real logic whatsoever (as damage dealt, turns, etc seemed completely arbitrary). I can not imagine a child (the target audience, I would assume) not getting frustrated by these. Overall, though - amazing,  unique and important!"
,Recommended,511630,34416385,Posted: 22 August,all,A Spooky Ghost,"I'm choosing to review this with the context of it being something of an edutainment game.Essentially you'll spend a day in the life (and imagination) of Max, an autistic boy. I have to admit I found myself rather charmed as the game went on - through the plot Max has his ups, his downs, and his moments where he's the same as any child his age. You're not going to find a mechanically complex or challenging game, since it's really more about experiencing Max's inner world and quirks specific to him - this is a good thing, though boss encounters will require you to be a bit more attentive with healing than other fights. There was one element I was actually quite surprised to see -very tenderly and gently given the age of the protagonist, the game discusses the risk of self harm and suicide in later years due to difficulties in coping and self management that can have their roots even in those early years of life.. I respect spine like that.This is also very clearly a game with a lot of love behind it. That normally isn't something I get to say in a review, not like this anyway.I also have mucho respect for attributing each and every song and sound effect used properly and visibly.Well done."
