,Recommended,511680,33846300,Posted: 27 July,all,Haar,"TL;DR: Have you played Fate/Extra and/or Fate/Extra CCC? Buy this. Have played other Fate games? Might be worth a buy. Only watched the various anime? Carefuly consider it. Never had any contact with the series? This is not the best place to start.As a disclaimer, I am a fate series veteran, played/watched most of all translated available material. Finished most of the game by now, am waiting until the end to summarize properly what I think regarding the story. All other points are still the same.PlotThe plot is a direct continuation from Fate/Extra CCC, the Japan-only highschool holy battle royale and waifu/bro simulator for the PSP.Being a direct continuation, you are quite literally thrown into the thick of things right from the start. Following in the footsteps of the Fate/Stay Night visual novel, you cannot choose a route from the get-go, as they are meant to be experienced in a specific order. Whereas in a game it might be seen as archaic for newcomers, I feel like it does help to tell a more cohesive story at the end.Written by Nasu with help of Hikaru Sakurai, the plot in the first part is, without mincing words, very predictable. As I have not finished the game yet, I can't tell if the first part serves the same purpose as the Fate route in F/SN (or, in a broader sense, the entirety of Fate/Extra) to better ease the reader into the world and by the third part it is more interesting and wild. Regardless, it was still very much a product you'd come to expect from Nasu, immensely poetic and descriptive as it is.More to the point, it is almost fanservice-y in parts, from character interactions to the roster. Many if not all quips might fly above the head of even someone that is used to the fate series but hasn't played the Extra duology; newcomers even more so.GameplayGameplay is standard Musou/Dynasty Warrior fare. Murder mooks until the big guy comes out, murder big guys, use your big finisher move on the boss, yay. For me, as a fan? It's very cool. For those who don't even know what happens when Archer uses his UBW? Less so.SoundtrackIt works and fits the theme of the game. If you've played Fate/Extra, you know what to expect.GraphicsGraphics are on the cheaper side of the spectrum. Sometimes it does look good, but some of the moves and special cutscenes that zoom in the characters look stiff and very low definition. Elizabeth Bathory's scenes are one of the biggest offenders. Just looks hastily put together. With the roster as frankly small as it is, when considering the franchise as a whole, this kind of thing is hard to defend.In closingMy opinion is that you should play this game mostly because of it's story. Even then, that story is a continuation of a game that was never localized, that was a sequel and proper closing of a game for the PSP when it was already on it's way out.For someone like me, this game is entertaining, funny, and honestly what I'd expect from all parties involved.For someone who never touched the fate series or universe, I can't see them overlooking the repetitive gameplay, frankly boring first chapter, hard to understand story and apparently random selection of historical/mythical figures that may or may not be genderbent for whatever reason.______________________Edit 1: Formatting issuesEdit 2: Updated soundtrack impressions, and where I was in the story."

,Not Recommended,511680,33821809,Posted: 26 July,all,William Shakesman,"I can't do it. I tried it on PS4 and on PC and I can't enjoy this game. To be fair, this port is excellent*, but I can't defend the game.There is a lot of VN stuff here, and if you want Tamamo or Nero as your doting waifu, this game lays that on SO INCREDIBLY THICK in the VN segments that your teeth will rot from the sweetness.The musou part of the game? It's... perfectly playable. I really have nothing bad to say about it for the sorts of people who just muck with musous for fun, to enjoy themselves. There's a lot of flash, a lot of style, and a lot of waifus on offer (Though you won't get a free pick of them until you knock out large chunks of the games' main story arcs.)But I just can't stand the musou parts of the game. There is nothing to your movesets. The levels are just great big colorful cyberboxes where you warp from zone to zone. At each zone, you have to stop and kill about 500 mooks to spawn the midbosses, kill two of them, kill another 500 (Triggering the ""Holy cow chief, you killed 1000? You are a true warrior of the holy grail!"" message all of 40 seconds into the fight.), kill the second set of midbosses, then you finally have the zone and now have to do that eight or nine more times throughout the map. This same kill, boss, kill, boss pattern is also how you do defense, so it takes just as long to repel an attack and shut your teammates whining for help up than it does to secure a new zone.If killing things were interesting in Extella, that would be fine. But it isn't. You do not have a Basara moveset. You barely have a Warriors moveset. While the moves are big, flashy, hit wide areas, and generally have an anime sensibility to them, they just aren't interesting. And the stop-and-go pace just drags each mission out tremendously. There is no fancy strategy or gimmick or story to be told in these levels, just the story of someone who has to walk to each room and slowly, laboriously clear it out while listening to your allies moan and wish you stopped attacking to clear out THEIR room. Any time the game gets clever mid-mission, it usually involves you clearing EVEN MORE rooms and making your conquest of the map nearly sisyphean. Worse, your musou attack is probably the least satisfying and most pointlessly long special move I've ever seen. Your ultras are cool, but they are kinda big skippable corny anime cutscenes appropriate to the Fate franchise. But you don't get those but once a match maybe and you'll probably mash that musou button most of the fight. The entire thing feels like an amateur's first musou, and that's really what it is. I rag on Senran Kagura, but Senran brings a lot better stuff to the table... like Yumi, for instance.These are all little things, but they add up. They may not be a big deal to you, really. But if you're the sort who noticed that Samurai Warriors 4-2 just completely bungled large parts of the combat, or that One Piece Pirate Warriors 3 was secretly the best musou Koei had done, if you know what Sengoku Basara even is or why someone would want to play it, if you're a musou connosieur, I don't think Fate Extella will fit the bill for you.That's not to say Extella is a bad game. I mean, I can't stand it and I think it's barely playable trash, but what is there, what effort they've put in, and the sheer amount of Fate fan-service... There's an audience for this game. If you aren't a musou snob, and you like the idea of having Tamamo and Nero practically beat the stuffing out of each other to prove which one loves you more, this might end up being something you like. But I can't enjoy it.*EDIT: By excellent, I mean it runs smooth and loads quick. I don't think it is hitting 60 FPS though, though the action isn't all that interesting enough to merit it, but I can understand disagreements on the issue."

,Recommended,511680,33897184,Posted: 29 July,all,TheMrKhaos ベルセルク,"Right out of the gate, this is a Dynasty Warrior game done up in the 'Fate' universe, kill lots of enemies, capture territories, blah blah blah so if you aren't into those kinds of games, might not be for you, personally, I love it. Only thing that has bugged me a bit in the main stories so far is there is equipment for your character so you can change the servant you are fighting as but I only seem to manage to be able to swap between the main servant and one other, not all 5 characters that are part of the story, but, they all do have their own side stories so I'll assume that's just the way it is.The graphics aren't great but they are alright for what they are. I'm assuming this is a port from PSP or Vita based off of the style, so it's really not hard to look passed. (What do I care, a weeb who gets more action style anime games? hell yeah.)So this is supposed to be the 3rd in this series, with the other 2 not available on steam, read a review that said it impacted the game a little if you've never played them, but I don't see how. The story is cohesive, mind you a little short, but I guess that's why there are 3 sides to it.All in all, I think this game is great (although, the dlc costumes are kinda weak sauce, oh well). 8/10"

,Not Recommended,511680,33833807,Posted: 27 July,all,泥鰍小妹妹,"Pro+Fast paced action keeps things from getting to monotonous+Far more exposition that you would expectCons-Limited Characters (DLC are all cosmetic)-Can Be Boring Very Fast-No way to access graphics setting.- Story can be pros and cons (i still do not get what the story is about since i have not play any fate game before)- Not So Organise DLC as PS4 counterparts.ConclusionFate/Extella: The Umbral Star is a competently crafted hack ‘n’ slasher that suffers from the same issues of repetition as its contemporaries. While making attempts at customization and depth, the core combat never rises to the challenge to match it.More nitpicky details include dated graphics and the unusual choice of font size. The framerate saves the game from looking like an early PlayStation 3 game, but the small font size makes reading the protagonist's own narration difficult when the system is docked. Playing it in handheld mode alleviates this somewhat, and was my preferred method of play (I'm of the mind that all visual novels should be enjoyed in the comfort of one's own bed).Note: There is no Graphics setting in game, by default the game runs in 1080p but if you playing this game on WQHD screen you will be slighltly dissapointed. Although this is a solid port, if you not Fate series fan or in onto musou style gameplay simply skip this title. there are many game that is worth your money."
,Recommended,511680,34235702,Posted: 14 August,all,Divad Legor,"Cons:You can tell this game was meant for consoles and not PC. All the graphics options are in a launcher, and if you want to use the mouse to control the camera, you have to go turn it on. I highly recommend a controller, because as clunky as the camera controls are with the joystick they are even worse with keyboard and mouse. I don't like how you can only lock the camera onto enemy Servants and not other major enemies. Also, the love stories are rather icky.Pros:It's a Warriors-style game. This means that the combat is extremely satisfying. Not only that, but it's a Warriors-style game in the Fate/ series, which allows for characters like Saber Nero, Jeane d'Arc, Atruria Pendragon, and everyone's least favorite character, GIlgamesh. You can tell he's a great character because those feelings of hate people feel for him are very, very real. Love stories aside, I enjoyed the plot, and the side stories are rather fun to experience. I'd say probably get one of the console versions, however if you don't have any of the other consoles then go ahead and buy it on Steam."

76561198147337725,Recommended,511680,33871250,Posted: 28 July,all,Soldier of Mercy 76,"Alright, first of all let me tell you that if you like Fate series, Simple yet good combat, Complex Fate Story Line and moe waifus, then you'll like this.Fate/EXTELLA is a combination of visual novel-ish with Dynasty Warrior based combat with Moe Waifus and handsome men in tight suits. The visual novel-ish portion of the game is done justice, really well written with emotions clearly existed. Laughter and tears, you got it all. Now the Dynasty Warrior part is surprisingly well done, with visual and music done right (Fate style, of course), with fast pace action and a LOT of killing (And I mean a LOT of killing). It might take you awhile to get to the portion where your character (servants) have their epic combo moves since there ARE grinding here in this game.However, what I don't really like about the Dynasty Warrior aspect of it is their zone based system. It's a bit too restricting, and the way you're going to reach to the next zone are set and thus it gets annoying manuvering around sometime. Also the allied AI in this game is really annoying to the point of becoming almost useless. They only move to other zone based on scripted events, and once they captured the zone they'll stay there until the game is over or they get killed by random mooks (Yes, they're THAT useless). At least make them move from zone to zone because this make them look like a glorified Mooks.But other than that the game is spot on. The event animation could sometime be 'Eh', but overall its great. From 0-10 (Unplayable to  Epic) I'll give it an '8/10', worth the price. But if you DON'T like an Anime based, visual novel-esque game you probably won't like it, and if you never watch, heard or even play a Fate Series then you might get confused at the plot so be warned!"

The Noble Phantasms are great just that its a shame that you can at most use once per mission (I know why you can't spam NP lore-wise but I wish I could).Overall it is still an enjoyable game for fans of the series and Altera is best girl."

The amount of enemies on screen is really high and other Musou games should really get up to speed. The combat is fast and feels responsive, even if it isn't all that complicated, the games sound effects and visual effects make it enjoyable enough to last.Unless you've played Fate/Extra the story will probably go in through one ear and out of the other. It's not bad, but not that great either.Amount of characters is fine, and most of them feel unique, one complaint I have is that you can't see what you unlock at each level, so you have to keep cheking your combo list while leveling a new character.As Musou games go, it's probably the best you can do on PC for now.8 Umus out of 10"

That can be a good thing, and a bad thing. Between missions you can easily spend 30 min reading dialog. This dialog is done well enough, expanding story and characters, however, it also is a long break between actual gameplay.With the addition of craftable equipment and passive bonuses, you get the same level of customisation, but in a slightly different ways then the Warrior games. In those games its mostly just passive bonuses, and while those exist in Fate/EXTELLA, you also get a number of active bonuses. These are consumable bonuses that increase damage, defense or healing on demand. The equipment you use alters your own decision making slightly, making it more engaging then it first seems.The part I personally dislike is how your character interacts with the various Servants and how the game intergrates a psudo-love story into the game. I'm not interested in banging any of the potential Wifus the game tries to pitch at you. Its an aspect that doesnt need to be there and adds nothing to the plot. You notice that every time you sit though an end of battle dialog. Your character is important to the world and worth guarding and protecting, but the romance side of it just feels tacked on.The last thing I have an issue with is what was chosen to have subtitles. Though the course of the game there are special moves that have small cutsceens play. During this time, the servant you are playing as is saying stuff, but no subtitles are displayed. While its probably not important, its not great to have it left as is.Dispite my issues with this game, I still give this a solid 7/10.There is room for improvements, and I hope that they work to solve the subtitle issues."

It builds off the setting from the two Fate/EXTRA games and continues a lot of those games' themes. If you're a fan of a lot of the Servants from the Fate series, you might be disappointed at how lopsided the characterisation can feel with the three leading ladies getting the vast majority of screen time and development through their story modes. Mechanically... it's a Musou game, you've got your square string and triangle charge attacks to form combos. You've got your special move and a super mode that charges faster as your combo increases, and you can collect items to use your ultimate attack. Maps are more in line with the Gundam Musou style than the Sangoku/Sengoku style battlefields with a handful of rooms connected by jump pads. You get spells you can use on your chosen dude and can craft new items that change your spell loadout. Character growth is split between EXP which increases stats and unlocks attacks, and bond (raised through conversation with the main girls, but also by fulfilling side objectives in stages or spamming spells on them) which increases the skills you can equip them with. Bond's effects are strictly mechanical for most characters but the main girls get events as you increase it, if you want to bathe with a Roman despot or roll around on a giant's stomach. Like all Musou games, the gameplay can quickly become dry and repetitive, and thus the game will more than likely live or die based on your investment in the characters.なんちゃって☆"

The game present you with choices during some of it's events in the story and in the My Room but the gameplay could be slightly better in terms of Allied AI. The allied AI are sometimes helpless to even defend their Sector while the enemy AI / Servant does a better job taking down the sectors you control, so it really feels that it's a one sided battle where the player rushes to their aid, eliminating threats and defending.Overall: 8Music: 8.5Gameplay: 7 (Allied AI are rather frail)Story: 8.5In short the game is a musou / hack & slash game with a story that started from Fate/Extra (CCC) and continued on the outcome of the ending in Fate/Extra CCC (Don't really need to play the past 2 games as this game reintroduces you to the characters but it does remark on some past events).

BUT, the game has glitchy audio (for me atlease) in the opening after the tutorial. Likewise, i cannot play this with graphical settings set to high. so some of the graphics are a little blocky or not shapely. the game so far, for the time I have played it, is really well done, and a great addition for anyone who has watched any of the Fate series or has read the Manga. BUT, again, my point remains that there needs to be some overhauls with audio and not being able to play the game with all the graphical settings on high.. the frame rate drop is unbearable! and the reaction time from hitting a button and it actually registering is still kinda bad even on medium settings. MIND YOU, I am playing on a brand new computer with all the best technical gear, but other than that, this game is great, and i hope updates released soon fix my few issues that i have with this game, because its not worth 49.99 in the state that it is in.

,Recommended,511680,34070964,Posted: 6 August,all,Geoson,"Half visual novel, half Dynasty Warriors. Fate/EXTELLA is a splendid experience for all Fate/ fans.While the gameplay can get a bit repetitive after a while, the story does a nice job at not dragging too long. Each story line is composed of about five 30~ minute battles with visual novel sequences in between. If you don't like some or any of the main three heriones, you might have some trouble, as the main story tries to really sell you on them and your relationship with them. It also has some VERY anime-esque scenes that might make some uncomfortable. (Only convinent water baths and IMPLIED dolphins this time.)For those that have no clue what a Dynasty Warriors game is all about, it's basically just a horde of enemies being thrown on your screen. Most are cannon fodder that won't stand a chance but there are some special units that can take a few more hits and even hit you back. Of course the real battle begins when you have to deal with enemy servants on the field, who will block and even try to unleash special moves on you. All of this occurs on a map that is broken into pieces, some worth more than others. The goal is to clear out or defend these sectors and claim them all for yourself. In addition to all that is each servant has their own level which will raise throughout your time playing the game. Increase your servant's level and you'll gain access to new moves, and if you increase their bond, more slots for passive buffs.The cast of characters has most of the beloved cast members that fans are itching to see more of, along with most of the returning cast of characters from the EXTRA series. This gives a lot of variety in playstyles when doing side missions and free battles, but sadly isn't utilized for the main plot, which definitely doesn't help the reptitive gameplay that I pointed out.The DLC is fair and honest for this game. Just some outfits for about a buck or two a piece. Sadly we are still missing out on some pre-order exclusives, but I'm hopeful they see the $$$ signs and include these down the line when the game has pretty much stopped selling.The port is pretty solid. Only seen maybe one or two frame drops in my playtime so far (16.5 hours) on really HUGE hits attacking a large amount of enemies, but I suspect that had more to do with my aging hard drive than anything else. You'll be glad to get this game on PC where you can run it without a hitch if your system allows for it, unlike the Vita or Switch versions which supposedly have some dips here and there. Programs like ReShade work on it as well if you dig trying to alter how the game looks.I recommend this to anyone that enjoys Fate/, and for the rest of you to go educate yourself and enjoy one of my favorite anime / visual novels so that you can come back to this."

Eventually it becomes a grind fest as the story content probably will be all done around 20 hours, then the rest is just collecting skills + lvling bond + lvling character.Not the best to play using keyboard which i did, the only issue with it is just turning camera while trying to fight at the same time.I'm personally not a Type-moon enthusiast, the extent of my knowledge is simply fate/zero, but I can see how it'll be a great game for TM fans and Fate fans, not sure if it's worth but I guess you guys will probably pick it up.DLC is not worth it cuz the game's lifespan is probably cap 100 hours (maybe 20 hours of story content +80 destroying AI to collect stuff), also the original outfits are pretty well designed already .The game does have some fan service but it's not crazy, maybe you'll eventually hit the stage where you'll wanna skip dialogues because the story is pretty easy to understand (and they're looooong, unecessarily long), which is somewhat not surprising because the game felt like a mid-budget game to say the best.Not worth the price rnbut definitely a good pick up for brainless grind fests and flashy animations, hard difficulty might prove to be slightly challenging."

If you are going through the game for the story there are times when you will litteraly spend more timer reading than combat, but that is what is expected with a story rich game.  You can go back and replay mission on a higher level, and when you do so skip the RP  Well worth the cost, even not on sale as there are many, many hours of content."

,Not Recommended,511680,33838963,Posted: 27 July,all,Vecta,"I'm a small fan of the Fate series and all, but I can't stand this game.First off, the story isn't interesting at all. You can't even call the scene where Tamamo and Nero meet up a plot twist, because it's literally the beginning of the game. Most of the dialogue is skipable and if you wanna increase the bond level, you choose the skinship option--because it's all about that fanservice. So, unless you care about a plot that has nothing to do with the Fate series or doing lewd things with Nero, you'll skip the dialogue.Supposedly, the games prior to this one were better in terms of story, so check those out if you want better story. Because I'm moving on to the gameplay, which is the main factor of this game and why you shouldn't buy it.It's mindless. Absolutely mindless. You're only ever going to need two combos: Dash + Heavy for clearing out large waves so you can trigger minibosses, and Light 4x + Heavy, which shreds through the minibosses health. The actual bosses, which are enemy servants, are a joke; all you have to do is parry them, which is done by pressing any attack button the second they land a hit on you. But, maybe you wanna use special moves, so you run around to 3 nodes and get Noble Phantasm keycards, and then you use it. I skip the cutscene, because it's the same thing every time and that gets boring after a while. Same with transformation; you become more powerful, but your moveset gets EVEN SIMPLER. As for Extella maneuvers, it's basically a noble phantasm, but you use it more often. It has damage, it has a cutscene--except YOU CAN'T SKIP THIS ONE. You just have to sit through it, mashing the B button for that extra damage.Overall, this game will waste your time. I""m just lucky enough that I could refund it with 2.8 hours played on it. So thank you for once, Steam."

It's a continuation from the Fate Extra series-which i've long forgotten about-with better-ish graphics and fast-paced battle system which can be enjoyed more if you play the game using a controller as the game was initially released for Vita,making the entire control scheme suited a controller more than a keyboard.They also included some of the soundtracks from the Extra series -nostalgic, makes me wanna play back those PSP games on the emulator.If you need to tweak the graphic settings,you can launch the separate configuration .exe before running the game.[updated about the DLC]So i grabbed some of the DLC outfits but so far can only be used for Nero as i haven't unlocked other stories yet.If you're not really a fan of Musou-ish kind of game,you're gonna get really bored by the battle stage as you need to clear out each platform by taking out the mini bossesand later fight the stage bossbut the fight can go on and on for a while as you're gonna need to farm the needed points to craft new items for your characteras well as the usual exp.[update]The farming is so tiring that i grew so bored i spent most of the time spamming the same movesand later turned on the auto-combo in the options and smashing the attack buttons 'till no one's standing.Will update this should i encountered anything new or interesting.verdict so far:8/10updated verdict:7/10"

You can only use TWO characters per campaign unless you get stupid lucky with hard mode drops, even then you can only use the others after the main game in free battles, and the writing makes me gag. Nero (the red girl) is obviously the writer's waifu, and the MC is so self-inserting it's disgusting. I care nothing for Nero, stop making MY character fawn all over her and act so childishly infatuated with her, and then locking all my actual favorite characters behind massive grind walls after the dang game is over. Then, even for a warriors game, this is pretty bare bones. each character has like 3 moves, a super special that can be used like once per mission, and a more powerful temporary mode where they just use power up versions of their same 3 moves. No way can I stand to play the exact same characters the exact same way while listening to this teenage-fanfic-level writing for three goddamn campaigns.TL:DR only buy if you are a hardcore Nero waifu-er, not worth it at all otherwise. I'm getting a refund, this game is nothing but empty waifu bait."

,Not Recommended,511680,33998034,Posted: 3 August,all,Zento,"This game is a mixed bag.The combat is pretty much the best part of the game and is fairly good for a warriors-style game and kept me entertained for many housr (hence my play time). The attack sets for characters is distinct enough to provide a nice diversity, but suffers from all ""super moves"" (extella/noble phantasm) being identical.Unfortunately, pretty much anything outside the actual fights is utterly horrible. Between missions the game turns into a crappy visual novel, with multiple female characters fawning over the MC. It's ripe with tropes, cringy dialogues and, obviously, unnecessary fan service.The setting/story doesn't make any sense, graphics are ok, the levels basically look all the same. Character progression is basic with your stats increasing upon level-up (xp gained by killing enemies). Character customization is limited to a set of passive slots, that can increase damage/speed/defense/xp or add elemental bonuses to your attacks, essentially what you upgrade your weapons with in recent warriors titles. Furthermore you can bring along up to 4 spells (each with a differet number of charges) that grant temporary buffs; the combinations of which is tied to non-cosmetic items that can be crafted with a very bare-bones crafting system.If you like warriors-style games and either can put up with the parts outside the misions, or are actually interested in them, I recommend it for you. Otherwise, stay away."

If you like Fate series this game is for you, if you don´t know anything about it, you may find it fun but will not understand anything of the world at all.Also don´t mind about people saying the DLC cost more than the game itself, they don´t understand that is not made to buy all costumes, just the one´s you like for your favorite character.Great game, hours of fun, mash buttons all day."

,Recommended,511680,34374405,Posted: 20 August,all,Pinkspring,"If you played Fate/Extra (And if you havn't, I highly recommend it) then this game is for you. If you havn't played Fate/Extra, you might well enjoy this, but do yourself a big favour and pick up Fate/Extra first.Brief: The game to my mind acts as a sort of epilogue for Fate/Extra, telling a very happy story of events after the  MC Holy Grail War - This alone is brilliant, as one normally never gets to experience the ""happy ever after"" part of a story, but here it is!As a result, the story is bubbly, upbeat, with appropriate ups and downs and a lot, and I mean a lot of romantic content.One downside is that the story can get repetitive, since it tells mostly the same story from multiple perspectives. That's par for the course with Nasu, but Extella's routes are pretty short, so the sense of repetition is real.The gameplay is, well..I thought it was a lot of fun. It's a very chaotic musou game with relatively simple controls and the ability to swap heroes around added a new layer of fun to it. While I can't say there was anything particularly special about obliterating Plants (Robots) and capturing zones, it felt very satisfying to carve a swath of destruction along a map and watch it turn blue. Pretty fun, all in all, but dont expect anything complicated here! Graphics are not exactly a masterpiece, and I get the feeling it wasn't supposed to be.The servant fights are also quite simple but still very fun. Nothing more to add there.Conclusion: This game is made for the fans, really, people who enjoy the Fate Series and -especially- those who played Fate/Extra and it's related games - It's about seeing what happens after the War, and the gameplay mostly plays a supportive role, with most effort seemingly having gone into the story, My Room Events, and cutscenes.It's a lot of fun if that is your thing."

,Recommended,511680,34226394,Posted: 13 August,all,"Stones, Thy Will is Salad","Its pretty good, casko is in the game and I converted to the church of umuall aside, the game is a weird choice to port over since its the third part of the fate/extra saga which already was weird to begin with so without any prior knowledge everything will be near incomprehensible. They might of been aware of this so made the MC an amnesiac so they can justify treating everything like you should know what is happening.The main thing for the game is that its strength and weakness is on how much you like the characters. The world building is unusual, with some things being explained but the overal context and setting is left vague. The moon is a giant magical computer I guess and its gone off the rails and you're partially responsible. Then you meet the personification of the destruction of civilization and things go crazyIts like escape from LA where everything is wrong except Pliskin is still Pliskin"
76561198050553351,Recommended,511680,34262862,Posted: 15 August,all,Regigigas,"In all honest, a great Dynasty Warriors style game. And an absolute must for Fate fans alongside Fate/Grand Order, which was just ported to the US market. However, the game is harder than some other Dynasty games. A friendly word of advice, if you dont like being constantly on defense, then play on easier difficulties, because unlike games like Pirate Warriors 3, the AI is incredibly aggressive. Still, a fun game and worth the price if you are a fan of either Fate or Dynasty Warriors. But if you aren't a big fan of the two, wait for a sale"

76561197967355674,Recommended,511680,34675867,Posted: 1 September,all,MEOWGGOTS!@!,"If you've played Fate/Extra for PSP then this is a must play as it follows the story of its predecessor. It is still a game with a good plot even if you haven't played the previous entry because the plot will become clear after you get to know the cast. The story really is one of the stronger points of this game as it will tug at your heart and wish to see how everything ends.Gameplay-wise, it's Dynasty Warriors with a couple twists to it. Might be a plus or a minus depending on how you feel about it. I believe this is one of the DW variants with most emphasis on the plot than any other ones.If you like the Fate Franchise and Dynast Warriors, then you might have a lot of fun with this game like I've had."
