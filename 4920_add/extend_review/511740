A lot of girls to fall in love with (in-game and irl).The infamous crashing at chapter 1-2, when you need to choose your path for the rest of the game, happens more often than not when you play it in english.To get past the crash and choose your path:Save your game in chapter 1-2, before doing the Entrance.Exit the game entirely.Start up the game, but choose the game language as japanese before going to the menu screen.Load up your game, do the Entrance, and you should be able to move past the crash.When you've chosen your path, save your game and exit the game entirely again.Start up the game again, but change the language back to english, and contiune to the loading screen and then to your saved game. Then you'll be good to go.You'll not understand a word of the ""japanese"", since the letters will be all gibberish. At least that's what it did on my computer. Sure, you might miss out on what the girls are saying after you picked the path, and depending on what path you pick, you don't know what you are saying to them, when you get a choice! It's okay, though, since you can still get the true endings and what not, even if you f**k up the first choice."

First of all its an on rails shooter. A classic game style that is sadly dying out. The quality of the shooting segments in this game is actually stellar. If you forget the context and just consider the mechanics its extremely well done and actually puts most other recent  games in the genre to shame (I'm looking at you Rambo). The controls are responsive, there is decent enemy variety, the boss fights are all a good change of pace from one another, and several of the levels are branching with different paths which give you a little extra replayability.Beyond being a shooter the game is also a VN and its a pretty solid one at that. You have 4 unique main routes with the main characters and then on top of that you can romance literally any character in the game. All the forgettable characters that generally get pushed into the background as you blast through them in shooter games, yeah they all have little backstories and can become  your girl of choice here (theres a ton of them). Which means you can play through this VN a whole bunch of times with at least a degree of variety (although full disclosure I havent tried any of the sub character routes yet myself). The game takes a handful of hours for every playthrough so it can potentially eat a lot of your time as well.So you take a good rail shooter and combine it with a good visual novel. If you like either genre you would probably enjoy this. I strongly recommend this game.Also for those dying to know the actual pervyness level here is pretty tame compared to some other VNs but it does have the hillarious feature of a panic button (""Mom walked into the room button"" is what its called in the menu) that pauses the game and hides your shameful display beneath the veneer of a classic jrpg. I found that both thoughtful and highly entertaining, thanks devs!."

So if you are wondering, you can still buy this, quickly play to that point which won't take long, and see if it works for you. If it crashes, a return is easy enough :)I hope this helps!"

You should buy it, if you are into shooting pheromones at school girls and female teachers trying to express their love to you.You can call this game “a lewd Japanese nonsense”. It’s an on-rails shooter. Your character moves through the school and then SUDDENLY GIRLS! Thousands of them! And every one of them wants to become your girlfriend forever. You have no choice but to defend yourself. You must disarm them - you do it by shooting pheromones at your attackers. In the best traditions of on-rails shooters, girls are zone-sensitive targets, so it matters where you shoot your load. Disarmed girls will scream with ecstasy and fall on the ground inlewdfunny possess. Apart from the standard shooting mechanics, you can see through girls’ clothes while zooming-in...and touch girls in doki-doki mode...and…and don't judge me.Story: a cupid tries to help you in your personal life, but messes everything up. Now not one, but every girl around wants to become truly yours. Your task is to find “the one” in this mess. All in one day, and if you fail you become forever alone instead. FOREVER. ALONE. There are 8 main story routes, and an avalanche of girls, with true, good and bad endings for every one. Enjoy.Gameplay: It’s your on-rails shooter: camera moves through the level, and targets creatively appear on your screen, you shoot your loads, they scream inagonyecstasy. In addition to that, you have a bomb-like attack which moves you to doki-doki mode for up to three girls. Yeah...nothing judgable here, move along.Characters: your childhood friend likes to strike weird poses to establish connection with heaven.

,Recommended,511740,25802050,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,Viscera,"This is an infamously lewd rail shooter and it really deserves its reputation. It's weird, raunchy, silly and plain dumb (even for an ecchi game). But it's also a lot of fun.As rail shooter, it actually holds up pretty well. It's pretty fun, works well and, while it's pretty simple (as rail shooters are), it does have quite a bit of depth to it. All enemies have a weak spot, where they can be defeated instantly. Some can only be defeated that way. Others have something like a ""shield"" that needs to be taken out first, before they can be defeated. On top of that, there are several optional objectives and other hidden items that can be shot. It's very unlikely that you will find everything on a single playthrough.Also, there are several different routes that can be taken. Near the beginning of the game, you can choose what story progression you want to have (with others being unlockable). Also, at several spots, you have a selection of several different levels, of whom you can only play one in a playthrough. Due to that, there's a lot of replay value, even if the game isn't particularly long.There's quite some diversity among the ""enemies"". Instead of just recycling the same few character models, there's a large roster of different characters, nearly all of which are encountered as enemies. On the other hand, you often meet the same characters over and over again. But even that makes sense, a school only has so many students and teachers after all (especially of one gender in a mixed school).However, while the game is fun as a rail shooter, if you even have only the slightest distaste for lewdness in video games, this game is really not for you. Even if you don't care for such things, it can easily get annoying. For one, the girls you ""fight"" against seem to downright climax when defeated. And that's just the beginning.I do have some gripes, though. It is often too easy to miss small optional targets, due to the player character moving away too fast. The fact that he is just walking around (instead of literally being on a rail) and as such logically could turn around again makes it needlessly frustrating. In that regard, Gal*Gun's genre works against it.There seem to be some accuracy issues. It happened several times that I was targeting something straight on, but still didn't hit it. Also targeting certain body parts doesn't always seem to work as it should.The translation is a mixed bag. Generally, it doesn't seem to be bad (although I can't say how accurate it is) and kinda funny, but there are several questionable references, ranging from amusing to downright cringy (which also goes to show that SJWs aren't the only ones who can mess up a translation with such things). Overall, they seem to have taken a bit too much freedom.The translation is also rather incomplete. While the necessary stuff is all there, in-game scenes, like during normal gameplay, ""special modes"" and boss battles, are lacking subtitles. After ""Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus"", which went quite an extra mile to add full subtitles to the game, that feels rather disappointing. Overall, PQube really could stand to learn a thing or two from XSeed.The PC version is pretty standard, as far as ports of Japanese games go. That is, it doesn't really offer any graphics settings beyond resolution selection. Apparently, it's possible to change other things by editing an ini file, but even then there seem to be issues.The controls, however, are much better than usual (but then, in a game like that, they really have to be). Not only is the mouse actually useful here, it's pretty much the definite way to play the game. One could even make the case that it's too easy, after all the game was originally designed with analog sticks in mind. But I sure wouldn't want to play it any other way.Overall, ""Gal*Gun: Double Peace"" is a really fun game. But it's really only suited for people who like ecchi games like this. If they also enjoy rail shooters, then it's pretty much an ideal game for them."

In the prologue you will encounter the: HAVE A BAD TIME meme at least 4 times.Yep, it's like that.But the game's good, if you care for this type of thing, of course.The framerate is not too shabby, and it the gameplay is simple, but satisfactory. Also, the controls are adapted for the PC MASTER RACE, so a controller is not obligatory.BUT, It has hideous screen tearings.

I didn't particularly question it when I threw $10 at this, because it's actually kinda fun. Hell, it's not even half as explicit as the Senran Kagura series and frankly it's more mechanically sound.I did, however, question my purchase when this crashed at stage 1-2 and, judging by the community discussions, this is the norm. (And if not at 1-2 then on launch, at the end of the game, or when starting New Game+.) Possible workarounds include rolling back graphics drivers, setting display to 720p windowed, changing the language to Japanese, or replacing one (or all) of the game files with pre-patch versions primarily obtained via less than legitimate means. As it turns out, most likely the same update that added the first mountain of DLC including the$90 x-ray glassesalso actually literally broke the game. This was in October 2016. It has not been fixed since. Evidently this publisher is far more concerned with peddling the most absurdly overpriced addons to the most desperately lonely shut-ins than it is with making sure its game actually goddamnworks.Just because it'spossibleto make the game stop crashing with a bunch of overwrought and invasive workarounds, doesn't mean it'sworth itto do so, much less that it's acceptable for it to be in such a state of disrepair in the first place.

It went to a point that I realised I needed a spreadsheet to organise what I was achieving in-game. And because of this, the replay value (repetition value, rather) is extremely high, in your quest to achieve 100% completion.But shan't spoil it here, if you like games that challenge your inside data-organiser while playing a hilariously cute shooter, this is for you (or you can wait for a sale)"

It might be a bit easy even on extreme, but can still be quite challenging if you're aiming for godlike rank and/or no damage, full combo runs.It seems like the translators had a great time working on this, but unfortunately there are no subtitles during gameplay (the non visual novel parts), kinda breaking it for those who don't understand basic Japanese. Though, it's mostly stuff irrelevant to the story, like girls complaining or calling their attacks, but that's still part of fun. Speaking of which, the story makes much more sense than anything HotD could ever pull... and it's sort of cute. The quest logs are also quite fun to read (they're displayed as LINE chats), and all enemies have names and (silly) backstories.Sadly, the achievement icons are the exact same as PS4/PSV trophy icons, and they look terrible to display on my steam profile. Texture quality is pretty bad, making the game look worse than it already is, due to console's limitation.

Has better controls than Star Fox Zero. The game is better than Star Fox Zero. Literally has a character archetype called “the pervert”. This game will teach you how to treat women right, or at least how to accept being with a doll. A game for serious gamers. Better map selection than the last 4 CoD games combined. Better exploration than No Mans Sky; you get to explore the bodies of over 20 different girls. A fun game for the whole family.

This is one series I'll be looking forward to for a while, even if the creators have moved on from it.Honestly, the time would've been 120 hours less, but I lost my saves and collection data when attempting to fix an issue (which was somehow mitigated by lowering the amount of saves I had). Double Peace has some weird bugs and glitches, but is still fun to play if you manage to find some fixes to the issues you may be having.For those who own Double Peace (or have obtained it through other means), I have a guide set up that you might enjoy reading about. For those who do not own Double Peace, I ask that you give it a try once it goes on sale. It isn't a guarantee that you won't be disappointed, but you may find Double Peace to be a fun game to wind down the day with from time to time.ADDITION: There are no mods for Double Peace at the time of this review.

,Recommended,511740,25983375,"Posted: 11 October, 2016",all,Slashley,"tl;dr; This is a rail-shooter. It's surprisingly fun and I have no regrets paying the full price, but be warned that the PC port is... rather barebones. I'd say that a controller is absolutely required.Long version:In this game, you shoot girls as they try to confess their love to you. Don't worry, they don't die - your Pheromone Shot just leaves them writhing in org4sm as you move on. The girl's weak points aren't always in the head, which by itself makes a rail-shooter much more interesting, but real catch is... you're not hunted by some copy-pasted mooks who all look and act the same like your typical rail-shooter. No, you're being hunted by an entire SCHOOL of girls. Each with their own unique design, personality, voice actor. This is awesome because you start recognizing these girls. First you start noticing the most vibrant hair colored ones. Oh, there's that girl with the bright red hair, her weakpoint is her face. Oh, that's the tall girl with the killer legs which are her weakpoint, easy shot. Then you start to notice their behaviors. Oh, there's that girl with the hairclips, better take her out first or she'll try to run straight up to me. Ah, one of the twins just turned that corner... since she's always with her sister, where is her other half now, are they going to pincer me? Oh, that girl is shy, I can leave her last since she won't have the guts to jump out of her cover. Oh, there's that one girl who isn't interested in me, better take her out before she leaves the screen.It's quite amazing since it makes the school feel vibrant and alive. And if it wasn't clear by now, it's not just one or two girls. There is literally 22 first years, 21 second years, 21 third years and 5 teachers who are after you. That's a total of 69 unique girls in the game. In addition, there's two heroines, two sub-heroines and one shopkeeper.The amount of effort they put into the girls really shows. Let me try to list all the things each girl has:Unique look with your usual ""anime-BS"" haircolors, hairstyles, model size. Everyone has the same uniform though.Their own weakpoints, which in most gameplay is just either head/chest/belly/legs. But is more specific in other modes.Everyone has their own unique shout for declaring their love for you (a ranged attack). If you are out of reach, like on a rooftop, even the brazen ones will resort to these shouts, although they do prefer...The brazen ones have a voiced line for when they hand over their love-letter to you.A unique ""game over"" speech if you fall from a girl's love attack.An ""evil version"" of all three of the above.Scripted behavior patterns. Which girls show up in each stage and what they do is scripted, but these stay consistent enough to give the girls a personality.A short ending of their own in ""free mode.""Hmm. That's quite a lot if you ask me, considering it's that times 69.The game is split into four routes, plus an additional route I'd call ""free mode."" The gameplay of all of these routes is exactly the same, so don't expect much variation from that. The fine, intricate and deep plot developments will vary on each route, of course. Free mode actually plays out quite differently, so it's kind of a shame how it is locked until you've completed all four routes.If leaving hordes of girls an org4smic mess isn't enough, the game also sports like a hundred quests, usually 2-3 per stage. These vary from ""zoom into a specific location on the map and shoot the shiny"" to ""zoom into girl X's face."" Plus collectables, like the Student Handbook of all 69 girls or alternative uniforms. These keep things fresh, as until you've memorized the map, there's always things to look out for.Now... onto the bad sides. This game was obviously made and designed for consoles and the PC port of this game is quite half-arsed. Although it is miles better than your average Japanese game PC port, that doesn't really give this game an excuse. Let's see... well, the mouse aiming works fine. You can use almost all menus with the mouse, though some don't interact at all or properly with mouse controls. For example, in free mode, you can't click on the ""compatibility"" button at all - you have to use the hotkey (X-Box controller Y = middle mouse button). Reading messages on your ingame cellphone simply doesn't work with the mousewheel - it scrolls more than a page of text at once. You'll need to use a controller or the down arrow key to scroll through those. The game does not recognise WASD as arrow keys either, which is quite annoying when you need to select the direction you face during ""surrounded ambush"" sequences.By far the worst offender though, are the minigames. The game does not at any point explain to you the mouse and keyboard controls - always only the gamepad controls. Considering how you only have a few seconds in these minigames, trying to find out the controls on your own is quite horrifying. So just... take your controller out during mini-games. You'll need it or fail miserably. On the plus side, sometimes the mouse controls are super easy compared to the controller (if you can guess them). Like, shake an analog stick left and right OR left-click and right click. Which one is faster to spam, I wonder? Well, I have to give them credit for trying to come up with minigames that don't require an analog controller.Other terrible things are that the game doesn't include anti-aliasing in the settings at all. Well, at least Resolution options are there, but... that's kinda lacking for a PC game. You can, however, mess around with .ini files to enable AA:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=770988352My Documents\My Games\UnrealEngine3\GG2 Game\Config\GG2SystemSettings.inibAllowD3D9MSAA=False(PS4時はFalseだった)Change tobAllowD3D9MSAA=TrueVSync is also in the same config file. I usually don't have issues with screen-tearing, but in this game, it was terrible. Like, every time my character turned, the screen got chopped up into three parts. So yeah, enable that if you have issues with it.The game was crashing for me a lot during loading screens. This wasn't much of an issue because there was a savepoint right before these loading screens... until boss battles. Who have their own loading screen after you complete a stage. These crashes stopped after I switched to fullscreen (which I hate playing in), but be warned that the game might not be 100% stable.And I guess last and least, I don't think any stage supports more than 20-30 girls. This group of girls keeps popping up throughout the stage instead of the full cast of the 69 girls. I'd speculate that this is a console memory limitation. Oh well, the pool of girls is still large enough so that it doesn't feel out of place. Oh, and the game is meant for Japanese locale. If you're not using that, some minor text bugs occur. For example, ""???"" turns into ""HHH"". No, that's not a wrestler talking to you, that's just an unknown person, okay?On the plus side... the game is NOT locked to 30FPS. Although you'd think that this should be an obvious thing, for some reason even AAA companies tend to ♥♥♥♥ this up. So I suppose I have to give them for this. Performance is also pretty good, my gaming PC has about five years old and the game runs at a pretty stable 60FPS, though with a testrun through a stage it seemed to dip to 45FPS in some wide, open areas. Didn't even notice until I tested it. So, good job there too.Overall, I have to say that GalGun is quite an enjoyable shooter. As long as you enjoy the basic gameplay, there is a ton of stages to mess around with. Perhaps you should test the Corsair version, and if you liked playing the first stage or two, buy it yourself? Then you can enjoy a railshooter which at first glance looks like a shallow, ecchi cash-in, but is actually a quite well made game.PS. F the 8k character limit."

Its currently on sale for 9.99, which is a very reasonable price, too. Each chapter in the story mode will have multiple levels to choose from each likely to contain branching paths with their own collectables (Student Handbooks) and hidden items to complete quests from the Sakura Network. I've only completed one full playthrough but it seems like there are at least 8~ish endings for the story mode as well as a score attack mode.Each ""enemy"" in the game is a named character with a full bio in her student handbook. She will have a set weakness that you can learn and use each time she shows up. If you memorize enough of them you can snap off some crazy fast combos for a HELL of a lot of points. Each of the girls seems to have costumes including accessories and items that can be changed in the Dress Up mode, and finally each character can be interacted with individually in ""Fantasize Mode"". What is fantasize mode? Guess.In my entire playthrough so far I have not experienced any crashes or bugs, but I did make sure to carefully follow any recommendations for avoiding them such as changing the screen during chapter 1-2 to avoid a crash. I dunno if I was lucky or the crahses were patched out but my experience so far is devoid of issues.One minor thing that might bother some, the menus and tutorials show the controls with Xbox style controls, but the actual in game prompts will use the correct prompts (either Xbox style or M&KB) and I found that at least one of the minigames so far was seriously impossible to complete with M&KB and like others I will probably plug in a controller to do the minigames with but stick with M&KB for the shooting segments."

Some apprentice ""angels"" and ""demons"" have had an accident and it's resulted in you being massively attractive for a day. The ""shooting"" is essentially delivering a touch to the girls crushing on you before their affection turns to anger and they start giving you a hard time. If you don't bring them to schoolgirl ""ecstasy"" (teen hearthrob way; not sexual way) in a matter of seconds, they'll pummel you with love letters, shout their affections/annoyance at you, poke you, and other playground tactics.It does help to be slightly perverted. It's not explicit or vulgar in its sexuality, though. Just slightly pervy.The game is relatively short, but there is some mild appeal in replaying it with different choices leading to different paths and some minor new scenes. i.e. My first time playing, I was pursuing Maya as my crush, and she got stuck on a giant glue trap, so that was a scenario challenge that I had. On a different path, another character was stuck in a window, and I had to yank her out.I got it at 75% off, and that's the price point I recommend it at. It does not seem like it's worth its full price of 43.99 CAD.It should be noted that there are some overpriced DLC sets available. It's basically a bunch of costume choices for the girls (most of which are not particularly sexy unless you have a specific fetish, although the ribbons are pretty nice), then one for bigger breasts, one for smaller breasts, and a massively expensive one that let's your x-ray vision see through their clothes. The thing is, there's an item in the game that sorta lets you do that anyway (hearts over nipples, panties still on), so I'm not really sure if the paid one is for full nudity or what, but at that price, just go get some hentai."

Really its just a silly way to translate the rail gun shooting into an anime environment. Instead of zombies, robots, or soldiers, its your typical anime school girls. Intead of receiving injuries, love letters are shoved in your face. Instead of bullets, its the ""cupid angel""'s gun that shoots love energy. Instead of dying, the girls stop in their tracks in a sort of state of euphoria.More on the themeSome people can't stand certain elements of anime shows, comics etc.The humor, the presentation, and a lot of the content, from character behavior, speech, situations etc., is completely anime flavored. If you typically watch, read etc., you'll recognize this and not blink an eye.Examples: A female character may be firing dual handed guns, and they cared to include a slight movement of her chest as part of the animation. Or, your good ol' girl in an embarassing situation lets out a drawn out scream.If you can't stand those things, it may rub you the wrong way.Having mentioned voices, some people don't care for female anime voices either.You won't have a choice here, all in game enemies and characters are female, and speak this way.GameplayExactly what you'd expect from a rail shooter.Where it goes weird goes back to the theme meld.In addition to shooting people quickly, building accuracy combos, and skill shots for collecting items, You also build up a sort of super bar that throws targets into a dream fantasy screen where their specific weak spots, now become zones you rapidly bombard with projectiles until they get overloaded with euphoria.In addition, you're given a choice of how the story plays out with who you claim is your true love in the beginning of the story, and there are story events corresponding to this that take place in the form of minigames, with more of the same sort of flavor.The final element thrown into the mix is attributes. Story dialogue is available according to your character's stats, which are determined initially by a character type, then modified by items you buy in between levels, and who exactly you use your ""super move"" on. Maintain these appropriately to the story path you've chosen, and you're golden.All this is what creates a different experience.A railgun shooter, built on the frame of a date sim, narrated like as a pseudo visual novel.There are a couple of elements that really don't exist outside fanservice purposes though.Example: A completion gallery of all the characters/enemies in the game, which has their names, intro, and their body measurements. - Which are filled in by you zooming in on them in game to measure them.Underwear is partial visible pretty frequently, and panty shots are pretty common.And then of course, the in game mini game locations and their objectives, the stages being all over a school filled with girls, visiting the pool, locker rooms, things like that.There is DLC that modifies the in game character chest size. That should tell you enough.Controls wise its nothing too complicated.There is keyboard/mouse support as well as gamepad.Sound wise it isn't that special.Repeated phrases of things like ""I'm happy"" and stuff like that when enemies ""die""The voice acting for the story elements isn't bad though.The music was pretty good as well.(Sheesh, I can't get that theme song out of my head...)Overall, regardless if you agree with some of the themes, some thought was put into making this and it shows.Was definitely different. I don't see a ton of replayability though, outside of just wanting to see other endings. The VN element just barely keeps it fresh in that regard.You're pretty much getting what you think you're getting. But its hard to look ""under the hood"" with how its presented to you in the screenshots and stuff. To me, the experience was like a mini VN, or almost an OVA. Almost. Comedy romance themed of course."

,Recommended,511740,33364739,Posted: 7 July,all,Ashercroix,"Okay, I picked this up for giggles, thinking it was basically House of the Dead, only with a lot more uguu~.  I was pretty much right, but shooting anime girls aside, there are some pretty creepy mechanics.  You can zoom in to see through things, every girl has one of four ""weak spots"" (face, chest, waist, legs), and there's something called ""doki-doki mode"" where you have to rub and touch the girl's body as the camera pans up and down, close-up, until she ""explodes"" and sends out a shockwave that immediately maxes out every other attacking girls' ""euphoria"".  Once euphoria is maxed, they collapse in a suggestive position, pretty much always with panties on display.That's about it for the perv factor.  Objectively, it's a pretty good game.  I've heard people are having trouble with it crashing, but it runs fine for me, some screen-tearing aside (GTX 1080 though).  You can buy upgrades and items in a shop with angel feathers earned from clearing levels (from a rocker chick with ""bunny ear"" hair), the mechanics get more complicated as the game goes on (I got to the devil-influenced girls, where you have to shoot the little devil corrupting them before they take damage - whoops, sorry, ""euphoria""), and there are little extras to shoot in the background sometimes (student IDs, little angel thingies, etc).  The voice acting is good (Japanese only), the writing is surprisingly well done and quite entertaining, and the characters are actually better than the usual flat archetypes (or are at least well-executed).  Oh, and the story - you get shot by a supercharged cupid's arrow by mistake and have until sunset today to find love, or never find it at all, ever, for the rest of your life.Altogether, I can recommend this as a solid, entertaining, (and pervy) rail shooter.  Mechanics, writing, and graphics are all good, so whether you should get it or not really comes down to your personal standards. Your reputation may also be at stake, so choose well."

And this time it's Gal Gun: Double Peace.So let's begin, Have you ever wanted to shoot women/girls because they just didn't understand you and your Hestia bodypillow and you're not a complete failure in life but just misunderstood? well then you're in luck because Gal Gun is here to save the day.The game revolves around drugging as much schoolgirls as you can with your aphrodisiac gun to make them ''fall in love'' with you, but we all know it's just a synonym for abusing them later on. And using your super vision to see some pantsu.(that's about the entire story as well.) Well anyway the game tries to mask this by making you choose a love interest which in the beginning is only 2 girls but after finishing a playthrough more girls unlock. So I firstly went for the busty older sister because of reasons and that's about it, pick a love interest, drug some schoolgirls and fall in love with your girl of choosing.Also the game isn't short of hentai memes which is a good thing? It makes you chuckle if you watched some Tentacle and WitchesDon't watch that pleaseor similiar hentai's.Also one more thing since I forgot to mention it previously, Don't buy the 80 bucks see through clothes more DLC please.You could buy a lot of porn with those 80 bucksSo my opinion on this game is that's it's pretty good. But I'm just a filthy weeb in need of some lewds and this game fully delivers. So should you buy it? Well if you're on the fence about it just wait for a sale and then buy it or watch some hentai, it's free to watch so it'll save you about 30 bucks tooAgain please dont watch Tentacle and Witches, watch something like Mankitsu Happening.But if you're a filthy weeb down in the dumps in need of some lewds and mediocre gameplay just like me go for it, it's not like it could get any worse."

As stupid and perverted as it may seem, the story lines for all the different routes are great so far. However, the thing that completely detracts from the game is the glitchs/bugs. The game sometimes crashes right when you are about to choose which girl (or girls) you want to fall in love with, making you have to start the level from the beginning. The worst thing though is that when you choose the sisters route and are at the final doki doki field, it switches between them so fast it is impossible to increase their affection bars. I do enjoy this game a lot more than I thought I would. You cannot doubt the power of a phermone shot and a bunch of cute girls chasing you down and trying to shove marriage certificates in your face. But I still I want to unlock the route to choose whichever girl that is a student and can't because I can't finish the last part of the sister route. So I would love to recommend this game, but I still have reservations about it. Even my kindred spirit, Sayu Suguri, couldn't save the game from being a disappointing and glitchy mess.

My only complant is the DLC is outrageously priced. I almost did not buy the because just because of the DLC being so over priced as I am a person that likes to get most of the dlc of a game even if I don't really use it. As of writting this review it is over $214 bucks for all the DLC, with one of them being $89.99, that is nuts. Some of the DLC is a simple wardrobe change for 4.99.Please creators, bring down the price of your DLC.Also please add sub-titles to everything. After Doki Doki or just in regular game you hear the girls say things but I have no clue what they are saying since I don't speak Japanese.Other than that it is a super fun game and I have to admit I enjoy getting the measurements of the teachers. wink wink.I would like to add that I have read others saying they had crashes.

,Recommended,511740,26093032,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,Miuna,"Jokes aside as there are enough this is a great game, sure i wont deny it isn't family friendly and can be a bit awkward if you are in Doki Doki and some one enters the room (no game draws attentions like moaning girls in 'interesting' poses being rubbed eh?) but even the game developers thought this through, if using a game pad use the 'back' button (or select on PS controller... i think?)/M on windows (check options to change this) in which quickly turns the game into a old school rpg, many call this a Panic button (or 'mom walked in the room' button as the game chooses) but it is kind of fun as not only does it acknoledge the game can be a bit... awkward but it offers you a helping hand in keeping your appearances up.Onto the game, so it's a on the rails shooter, i love these games, for them who don't know, it's like House of the dead or Ghost Squad or Time crisis in the arcades, with a side of Visual Novel, The shooter side to the game is great, yeah if you want a game with cute girls chasing you flipping skirts as they fall and what not this will be your thing but lets not forget, it IS a game as well, your objective is to shooter the girls with your gun (it doesn't kill them, it shoots them into a state of Euthoria), the girls being your main target vary in weakness (4 main weakness consist of Head, chest, hips. legs) in which adds a fun turn to the game in stratergy (not like just shooting a zombie head in HOD), there are also Teachers who chase you down who can take a large number of shots (you have charge shots for this) and girls who are possesed by the demon who have to have a guardian like thing shot to harm them, with bosses and hold out points as well. The shooter side never gets boring and offers score attack mode as well.The visual novel side is also quite well done, having being shot by an Angel (similar to a cupid i guess) with an accidental over-charged shot you have only one day to confess to the girl you love (the cupid arrows makes everyone attracted to you... hense the girls chasing you) or else you will be in no other terms, forever alone. I liked the visual novel side, it features minor visual novel rpg elements such as you develop stats based on your chosen personality which effect which choices you can make in game (if you have high Perviness you can make funny choices usually focused on mollesting your target whilst if you go into say intelligence you can make more intelligent choices, these stats also effect which girls will take a interest in you during the game which can make it tougher or easier to gain the one you want. The game features 4 main girls routes you can do but offers the ability to persue minor characters (girls who chase you down) as well, this is a fun way to not only expand the game but also offer a lot more play time, it's also one of the only games i have ever seen which lets you persue pointless minors (theres about 75+ of them!!!), though i can't imagine their stories are half existant (i haven't played one yet), it is still a nice touch to be able to say you don't want a main and take the cute girl chasing you down.Each story takes about 5-6 hours including game play, maybe less, this might sound short but remember, the routes are one point focused in that you choose a girl and you spend a lot of time persuing that girl, making the routes feel very unique and offerings about 20-25 hours overall game play from them. Including sub routes and score attack you could probably get some heavy play time out of this game expanding over 50 hours (i imagine i will!). Each time choices are offered they also offer lots of options (6-8) instead of the standard 2-3 which as mentioned reflect your personality.The game has a feature called Doki Doki mode, this can be used to get out of sticky situations in story mode but also gives you chances to develop your personality in different ways (i don't know if this is based by your target or not).Overall i strongly recommend this game if you enjoy a good on the rails shooter type game or just enjoy cute anime girls chasing you around, its shooter side is very fun and entertaining whilst quite amusing (girls beating you with love letters, stamping you or just yelling their affection at you is quite fun), it is a great way to escase the world and enjoy some fun not to violent shooting.Side note - the game offers a dressing room which lets you customise the main girls AND ALL minors in the game, you can change them into different uniforms, gym clothes and swimsuites, you can do this to all students so it can be quite fun, you can also customise accessories worn and their combat weapons (though i have none unlocked).The art is also brilliant, Something about the character design just really works well for me and i enjoy watching the animated characters moving... even if just waiting for me to click the next button.Overall 9/10 for me (only thing stopping a 10 is the character routes being short):Watch the trailer, it actually is quite accurate in what the game is like, it even acknoledges how ridiculous the concept is, yet some how fun.For them concerned about the price, i know it might seems steep (this seems to be peoples biggest problem) but it is worth it for them who want to play it a lot, for them who will rush through it to complete the main routes and never play again, maybe not worth the full price tag.Remember, the game was made to be a joke and it is one, it is brilliant and fun, crazy even, weird as heck but a great laugh, oh and i love the whole 'your family will disown you for playing this' jokes but if you have some good friends who enjoy this stuff, im sure you will have a blast playing this and discussing it ;)Regardings controller support, it works great, i have issues playing on the rail shooters without holding a gun but this one worked really well actually, it is very responsive and easy to play (i commonly find it hard to aim or directional keys are slow and sluggish in moving croshairs, i use a Xbox One controller and it is brilliant, i can play Keyboard with no issue but i think if you have a controller i would recommend using it, as buttons for stuff like Doki Doki mode or event actions are a lot easier to perform."

I'm deciding to not refund because it's worth that, but DEFINITELY NOT full price... If you want to drop $40 on tiddies go buy Senran Kagura Estival Versus, the gameplay is actually fun whereas this game is like Sonicomi mixed with Senran Kagura, but with less fan service, and Sonicomi was only $10 retail but the story/gameplay was a lot more engaging than this game. The girls also are not as sexy as either of those games. I'm not saying this is a bad game, but it's not worth $40. If you think you might like it, wait for a 75% discount. The DLC options are a complete joke/obvious money grab. Like I said... if you want to play a solid game with nice anime waifu's, Senran Kagura is your best bet. Senran Kagura Estival Versus 10/10, Sonicomi 7.5/10, Gal Gun 4.5/10. Maybe this just isn't my type of tiddy game... lots of other people seem to like it.

76561198058156743,Recommended,511740,25827873,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,Inspector Dosh,"Well, here's a weird game about giving school girls euphoria because some incompetent angel shot you with a boat loads of cupid arrows with enough force to knock you unconscious for some reason only to wake up having the entire female school population to have the hots for you, only to simultaneously carry a curse that unless you get a girlfriend before the end of the day, you will be forever alone. Yeah, I think that sums up what this game is all about.Okay, on a more serious note, Gal Gun: Double Peace is a pretty basic on-rails shooter that doesn't really do anything special gameplay wise, only with a ton of anime fanservice (suprisingly tame in comparison to some other games I know of), but that is pretty much the best part about this game is how it never took itself seriously to begin with. Each playthough will take you about 2 to 3 hours average if you took your time reading everything and speedrunning may take you about an hour and a half or less. Each playthrough allows you to go on different routes to pursue different love interests increasing its overall replay value, but unfortunately boss fights are exactly the same regardless of who you choose. There are two difficulty settings, beginner and expert, but honestly never found the game to be difficult to begin with when using mouse and keyboard.As for the port, it's okay as in it runs at 60 fps and it has proper mouse and keyboard support, but it's missing some resolution options and a few other graphical options in the game itself like anti-aliasing, so if you want to change those options, you need to dig around the .ini files in order to do so. Although, it doesn't really change my opinion of the game, the texture quality is pretty bad in a lot of areas in the environment, but really, I think that's not what most people will be staring at anyway.Gal Gun: Double Peace is pretty much just an average on-rails shooter, but for $40, it feels a little bit too much in comparison to most other on-rails shooters on steam, but if you're willing to give up on buying Overwatch for this and you like weird stuff in general, then by all means go right ahead and buy gal gun and enjoy the insanity. Don't forget to use the ""panic button"" in case of emergencies."

While the game explains things, more or less, in English, action produces a lot of Kanji on the screen.  May thrill Anime fanboys.  Not me.I'd hoped for more control of the action than the game provides.  All one really does is point-n-shoot which, in this game anyway, entertains me for approximately 4.9 micro seconds; and, then the player's point of view is dragged away, in my case kicking and screaming, another direction.IMHO not worth $10 Zimbabwean dollars much less the almost infinitely more valuable $10 U.S. it cost me.  YMMV of course.  I don't expect a mainstream gaming experience for $10; however, I don't believe this game delivers much gaming at all. I wish I could get my $10 U.S. back.  If I'd have gotten this game for free I'd probably demand my time spent trying to play it be reimbursed.FWIW - I am a curmudgeon."

I'm not a pervert or sicko or any such person, but I really wanted this game. I've been out of anime since I became a brony (male fan of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic), so I considered this game a treat.But unfortunately, like I said, I can't play this game because the game won't load past the main menu. I waited a month before I could get it only to be given the middle finger. I feel like I'm being punished for wanting to play a game, that's never happened to me before. I never wasted money on a game to have it not work in my life, but it has now just happened.I don't want to refund the money because Steam's ""anime game sale"" is over and the game is back to costing $40. I never thought I would hate game developers as much as I hate the US government, but I do now. But, I can honestly say, it's a relief to know that I'm not the only one having this problem with the game.I don't recommend this game until the game developers get their heads out of their rears and fix the crashing problems.

But its like buying a firework for new year. Many people do it but why not just watch it instead?Consider how many things you can get for that price... Also concider that game will start to replay itself after one route (5 hours), giving only small changes into plot line. Seriously dissapointing from time perspective.  I used to have too much money I guess. Paying half of this price would've been enough for such pervy shooter. Sometimes desire is overwhelming brain functions.That's my note for my future self.

It has a huge variety of content and all the girls in the game have a different V.A and a different biography that you can engage with. There are hundreds of hidden items, as well as unlockables in this game. There are free outfits you can unlock in the game but if it's your first time the screen moves so fast you don't even know where all the hidden items are, which gives this game a LOT of content. It's not a native computer game and I think the port is not very good. If you have problems with custom resolution like me (1360x768 and NOT 1366x768) you need to edit the config file to have one of your F keys binded to the resolution you want. Also there is a glitch before the first choice you make that crashes the game, some people have experienced that,There are guides on steam for these things. I hope the developers are actively working on these fixes like they say they are.10/10 no game breaking problems with the port.Oh and you can play this with 1 hand, it's not the best but it's possible."

,Recommended,511740,31051916,Posted: 9 April,all,Kinzo きんぞ,"I'm gonna review this game from an actual gaming perspective. Not everyone wants to play this game with their pants down.So this is an on-rail shooter, don't expect much plot because let's be honest, ""Who cares?"" When it comes to a game like this, it's about how much the game delivers, not how deep it's story is. I'll be honest, I got bored of playing it after my first playthrough.Sure you got multiple different routes to take and different endings to get, about 5 or 6 different endings, but it's all the same to me. You're just going around the school campus shooting at any girl that jumps at you. There isn't that much urgency either, you see a girl you got time to shoot her because they take a long time to even get up to you. When they do reach you, they kinda just stand there and wait. They don't attack you until they've been there for a good few seconds. For the ones that hurt you from a far, they're the same way too, they take their time hurting you.Also, let's not forget that this game has DLC that's ACTUALLY $89.99, for something you can get IN GAME without having to waste that kind of money. It's a matter of: Do you actually want to play the game or just fap? That's really what that DLC is for.Sometimes the game has these sections where a girl is in trouble, as in she gets stuck in a window or she gets stuck on the ground by something, whatever situation calls for you to rub her extensively all over her body. These are just here to break from the normal gameplay and to get a perfect score is kinda tricky.The game only has 7 chapters, it isn't that long of a game but after your first playthrough, you realize that you have to go through the game with a different ending in order to gain access to the other possible endings. I'm sorry, but the game didn't keep me that invested enough to playthrough it again.On-rail porn shooter simulator 2016, now with more boob jiggle and all the DLC fan service that is ACTUALLY $90.69/10 would fap again."

,Recommended,511740,29998067,Posted: 17 February,all,🍀nozomi🍀,"Oh, dios mio. Where do I even begin? (Essay coming in, tl;dr at bottom if you want the gist.)You play as Houdai, a guy who sucks at romance. Because he's like that, some angel girl is like ""hey you want love right well bangbang"" but some demon girl is like ""haha i'm a demon time to be spooked""So angel girl (Ekoro) forgot to check the power level on her angel gun, and fills Houdai with every bit of attractiveness he'd ever get in his life, aka she went bang-bang and now he makes girls ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when he looks at them.Early on in the game, Ekoro makes you decide who you want to be your girlfriend, with 7 choices available.Shinobu Kamizono, Maya Kamizono, both of them at the same time, Ekoro, Kurona (demon girl), and anyone you can find in the school. (Along with one secret route).My personal favorite is Shinobu, because she's the first route I did, but that's irrelevant for you new players.Onto the gameplay itself, it's a rail shooter, which (for those who don't know, your character moves on a set path, while your goal is to aim and find secrets) works surprisingly good. What you shoot...is girls. By looking at them. Your ""pheromone shot"" is like a bullet of love to the girls, and the girls you shoot get ""euphoria"", where they just fall over in ecstasy. Every girl has a weak point, and when you shoot that, they go down instantly.And then we have Doki-Doki Mode. This is your ""bomb"" ability, in which after you've given enough girls ecstasy, you can go into the Doki-Doki Field with them...and feel them all over. Get their affection bar to max, and they'll let out an explosion of euphoria, knocking out every girl currently on the screen.There are also Event Minigames, exclusive to Shinobu and Maya's routes (including the one where Houdai goes for both of them). You start out shooting certain spots on the girl that are randomized, sometimes rubbing places as well. After a bit you have the action area, where you don't shoot, but move your mouse/controller for other things. The controls are easy to learn and the game has a good difficulty, especially for newcomers to rail shooters (Although I'd question why you'd start with this as your first rail shooter)The stories are...somehow pretty well done. Like, you'd think they'd just kind of be there while you wait for the next stage so you can give girls euphoria, but the story was rather enthralling for me. The soundtrack is pretty good, but usually I'm too focused on aiming to actually listen to it. Except for the last mission's music, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's so good.The graphics are pretty good, but I wish the backgrounds looked better, as they're somewhat bland, but the final mission has nice lighting.There's also DLC, most are just outfits for the schoolgirls and romantic interests, but there's also ""Pheromone Z"". It's...It's $90 DLC that makes it so you can see right through the girls' outfits (except the bra and panties, this isn't quite an H-Game). Tons of people complain about it, but the devs said that the DLC is kind of a joke, but it's there for those who really want it. To each their own, I guess. There's also the ""Demon's Pork Buns"", which makes the girls bustier, and the ""Angel Cutting Board"", which makes the girls flatter.I mean, the game's technically rated M, but I'd imagine most people who own this game are probably younger than that, there's a feature called ""Mom's In The Room Mode"", which, when you press the Back button on your controller (not sure what key it is on the keyboard), it goes into a retro RPG type of thing which you can't play, but it makes it look innocent.Overall, Gal*Gun: Double Peace is a very enjoyable rail shooter that offers a surprisingly interesting story. A solid 8.75/10.TL;DR: Fun game, somehow an interesting story, and boobs."

If the devs are refusing to investigate MYRIAD reports of REPEATABLE GAME BREAKING BUGS and CRASHES then it is not even worth the $10 sale price, let alone the $40 full price.Don't waste your money on this, not even on a steam sale.

This game contains ecchi only that means NO hentai. It contains a story mode,score mode, collection mode and a dressing mode. In story mode you play the story of the game with shooting levels, boss battles, visual novel content with dialog choices which are important to get the hearth of your favorite girl and you can collect in every level backstorys of the girls and new outfits. In score mode you can play every level (if you already discovered it), boss battle and events where you can get an highscore. In gallery mode you can look at all girls and read their backstorys. And dressing mode is a dressing room where you can decide the outfits of the girls and items.The only bad point of the game is that there are some item issues with the dlcs ( you get the wrong items).I really recommend this game and can say its worth the price ^^It should win because it gives me a nice school flair like in my schooltime and in no other game are you loved soo much by many cute girls ^-^"

You're shooting a pheremone to bring women into extacy fueled coma.It has quiet a few paths and levels you can take to change things up for each playthru along with a shop system that allows you to upgrade your health, basic shot damage, and power shot damage and affect range among other additionsThe Visual Novel choices range from generic, seen in every VN possible, to just out right rediculous in a funny way. Overall the story is just stupid and poorly written, but it's what you get with games like these that rely on sex appeal.It's a great On Rail Shooter but it doesn't fully compare to games like House of the Dead.Overall, get it if you enjoy on rail shooters, or if you want a really stupid game with solid gameplay but a horrible plot."

But  for what it is this game is way overpriced . So like most of the negative reviews I  recommend  purchase at a lower price.  say 7.95 or so.  Wait the price of this thing will drop and do not forget you can see the whole thing on various let's play videos on you tube.By the way  If the developer reads the above comment .

This game has multiple routes to choose from and what matters the most is you boost your stats and the chosen girl's affection levels to ensure you get the waifu you love best.This is a linear on-rails shooter where you go around shooting girls and feeling them. This game encourages you highly to use a keyboard and mouse to play this game (even if ironically menu UI uses XBOX buttons). This game has perhaps the most interesting ways the mouse is utilised in a video game. Aside from the on rails shooting, you use the mouse to feel up the girls when you activate Doki-Doki mode, touching them in... many places while getting... incredible views and tons and tons of fanservice shots in which I'm pretty sure you'll go ham with the F12 key. Some moments go even deeper with your chosen waifu where you shoot certain spots of their body and/or feel them up with it. Then you use your mouse to like, thrust at them, and/or get punished like a masochist, etc. Clearly, just when I thought Hotaru no Nikki had one of the most interesting uses of the mouse, this game steps in to take the cake. You can even hide the fanservice from your mom by pressing M/Back and it becomes an 8-Bit RPG!Graphics are pretty decent for Unreal 3 with a smooth framerate. The music is okay, it could use some more variety in some levels.This game is fun, I will say. I haven't seen an on-rails shooter in a while that's good. It's also a very fun ecchi title as well. You can play this game multiple times for multiple endings, and its easy to pick up and play. This perfectly simulates how stressful it can be to be the senpai. Though in the end, you do get to see what its like for a kouhai to be noticed by a senapi. It ends in super happy climax.Did I mention this game is rated E for Everyone?"

Finding secret items is difficult, but not impossible if you know where to look. The one thing I would change Is the color of either the 'hips' extacy area or the 'chest' extacy area, as the former is yellow and the latter is orange, so it's hard to tell them apart."

Maybe I'm getting too old for this.I found this game to be more entertaining than Senran Kagura, and less entertaining than Akiba's Trip.The premise sounds much more hilarious when you read it than it is during the gameplay. However, the game has surprising amount of depth in it, in the sense that there are a LOT of small things you could unlock, fill, ""collect"", etc. You could probably kill at least a month if not more hunting them all.Every single girl (I think there's roughly 100 characters in the game) in the game has unique character, short biography, may or may not occasionally give out an optional ""quest"" (those show up in cellphone between levels), you can get an ending with any of them, and they are all voiced. Of course, only main heroines get proper full ending with unique song/artwork, but every char has few voiced lines to say in ending squence. So, ridiculous amount of work went into making the characters. You can also spent large amount of time going hunting for every hidden item and secret in the game.However, the difficulty is quite low (with mouse you probably won't have any trouble beating the game on maximum difficulty), locations are occasionally reused - meaning you have same background level, but you go through it in different way, hidden items are in different locations, and different characters attack you.The game also has strange DLC policy, which may or may not be an expression of japanese humor. I think the day where a japanese game is released with clothing editor (and not with thousand costume dlcs), the hell will freeze over.I've also experienced occasional crashes. Pausing the game and alt-tabbing it crashes it fairly reliably, those crashes happened two or three times between levels. Thankfully, levels are short.Another thing that is worth keeping in mind, that there are a lot of voice lines without subtitles. Girls say interesting thing, but unless you have at least very basic understanding of japanese (meaning you can roughly understand 20..50% by ear), you'll miss them out. There's nothing critical, and and ""VN-style"" dialogue is fully translated (meaning you have text you can read), but in few situations in minigames characters give you hints with voice about what you need to do next, and those voice lines have no subtitles.Bottom line:Quite a bit of depth in it, not very difficult, worth checking out, but if you want something hilarious, Akiba's trip might be a better choice."

While the overall perverted nature of the game can not be hidden, the way it is played is enjoyable and somewhat reminds me of House of the Dead. The mix of a dating sim with the on rail shooter is one i did not know i wanted until i had it.Pros:-Challenging gameplay (the game requires accuracy and reaction times if you even plan on getting a higher score)-Decent dating sim ( the girls are simple archetypes but they get the job done)-Plenty of collectables ( Collectables are well hidden and require use of abilities and skill to obtain)-Various endings (multiple playthroughs can give you different scenarios and keep it from being a boring slog)Cons:-Repetitive Gameplay (Scenarios are different at times but overall the same thing is still done)-Mostly Useless upgrade system (the shop is mostly just for upping stats and getting a different ending, can ignore the upgrades the entire game and still perform just fine)-Overall ease (some might see this as a positive but if you don't care about score, then the game is a complete breeze)"

If you're a loser and have totally give up on life, or simply love one or more of the genres I've mentioned and don't mind some heavy ecchi stuff, give it a try, it's a really and surprisingly fun game. Mini games and bosses are actually pretty good too, even though it's totally not safe for work or ""family friendly"", if you know what I mean.There's also a lot of achievements and secret things to get, and a good variety of endings and stages to play, so you can have lots of fun (not only in the way you're thinking) for quite some time.And the ""M"" key can really save your life, trust me and try it when you're about to get caught."
