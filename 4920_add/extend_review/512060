I didn’t think it’d be much more than a cheap cash grab, but I enjoyed my time more than I thought I would.There’s still not a lot here as far as gameplay and content is concerned, but what’s there is pretty good. It’s not the best visual novel of its type out there, but it’s definitely far from the worst. The humor and surprisingly unsettling insight into True Best North Korea made this game much more intriguing and entertaining than I would have thought at a first glance.Altogether though, both girls are somewhat lacking in depth. While more aspects are hinted at least a little bit in places, most of the time the game plays it completely straight with the characters. You’ll largely know what they’re like within the first five minutes of the game just from cliches and tropes alone. That doesn’t make them uninteresting, mind you, just somewhat predictable.Even with that said, the humor and cute interactions are generally entertaining enough to keep the game from being dull. Couple that with the above sections regarding Korea itself, as well as some nice art, and you've really got something. While I’m not about to take to forums and start declaring who I think is Best Girl, I did enjoy my time with both options.Amidst all the humor and romantic interludes, there was a genuine sense of unease that affected both the protagonist and the player. It truly felt like you’d have to watch everything you said and did to avoid falling out of line -- and even if you did everything right, you were still very much unwelcome.That’s not what people are coming to play the game for, mind you… but the fact that these real situations were addressed in such a manner caught me completely off guard and is absolutely worth mentioning. Couple this with frequently clever dialogue and humor, and the writing quality in Stay! Stay! proved quite impressive.I can’t really say I’d recommend it at its price point to anyone but an enthusiast, but should you find yourself considering it, know that there’s a fun experience to be had.My Verdict 6/10 A short, sweet, and funny visual novel that is much smarter than it looks but still far from brilliant."

76561198129411711,Recommended,512060,32693903,Posted: 23 June,all,Inconsistent Gamer,"InStay! Stay! Democratic People's Republic of Korea!you play as an AmericanMarinecapitalist pig-dog on leave froma tour of duty in AfghanistanWestern imperialism and his first ever trip toNorth KoreaBestKorea. He is heading there to meet with some pen-pal friends in the People's Army expecting them to be men like him, but when he gets there he finds out they are actually twocute, young ladiesloyal servants to Glorious Leader, Jeong and Eunji. Not that he is complaining. During his stay inNorth Koreathe oneTrue Korea, his female friends, acting like tour guides, accompany him to see various sights and cities ofa totalitarian hell-hole with crushing poverty and human rights violationsthe greatest country on Earth.If you are reading this, then you probably already know that this is a parody/comedy game. Specifically, it is a parody of the visual novelGo! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~(2011), one of the more well-known, though some might say infamous, visual novel offerings available on Steam.Having previously played and very much enjoyed DEVGRU-P's hilarious parody gamePanzermadels: Tank Dating Simulator(2016), I looked forward to seeing what they would come up with inStay! Stay! Democratic People's Republic of Korea!Suffice it to say that I was not disappointed. Everything that madePanzermadelsa great parody game is improved upon in this release.To start off, the art in this game is very well done. I initially went into this expecting sub-par art since it is a parody game, but my expectations were exceeded. Indeed, everything from the character designs, backgrounds, and CGs are beautifully done as would be expected of any professional visual novel. The music is also a nice treat as it adds to the experience of the game.However, the main reason anyone is going to be playing this game is for the writing and humor. This is where the game truly excels. From beginning to end, there is almost non-stop laughs at the various types of humor in the game. Many points in the game lampoonGo! Go! Nippon!and otaku-pandering from the contrived premise to fascination over minor things. Perhaps one of my favorite jokes is the overly-elaborate description the protagonist offers of a ""plain and ordinary"" toilet, parodying a scene inGo! Go! Nippon!where a character is amazed over a Japanese toilet. But besides the direct parodies, there is also a lot of satire in the game of North Korean life such as the cult of personality surrounding the ""Glorious Leader"" and various other things North Korea has been involved in over the years. There are also various self-referential jokes such as making fun of visual novels in general and some hilarious fourth-wall jokes. Really, there is so much humor you really just have to play and experience it for yourself.Because this is a parody game, there is not really much of a story going on. There is a twist that happens much later on and there is a bit of a plot near the end, but it does not really amount to much. Overall, there are four separate endings you can achieve in this game depending on what choices you make during play.In my review ofPanzermadels, one of my gripes was with the poor interface. However, I was happy to see that DEVGRU-P really stepped up their game in this regard and really polished the interface. You have the option to skip text that has already been read and more than enough save slots.In addition to the content available in the game, there is also an adult patch made available just recently, and I played the version with it. It adds some nudity to a few scenes that previously had none. It does not really add or subtract anything from the game unless you really enjoy seeing anime-style nudity.If there are any criticisms I have of this game, it would be that, despite the amount of laughs I got, some of the jokes did not always work. For example, Eunji is written as a parody of the tsundere archetype character and this is referenced multiple times. It was funny at first, but after a while it started feeling a little tired. Still, this is a minor point that really did not affect my overall enjoyment of the game.In conclusion, this game is a hilarious parody. Though it might be a bit unconventional considering the material being lampooned, it is nonetheless very humorous. I would recommend this to those that might appreciate a parody of visual novels or a general satire of North Korea."

A good galgame to lighten the mood...except that all the endings are kinda depressing. Still, it won't have the same effect on the players if all the endings are like cheesy galgames.

,Recommended,512060,32151734,Posted: 3 June,all,headache,"Equal parts wit, satire, and adorableness compose this visual novel.Having played Panzermadels through a whole run and this through a whole run, it's great to see that DEVGRU-P is focusing on creating more content and choices: while I didn't count the amount of choices, Steam did count the time spent on each playthrough. Panzermadels clocked in at two and Stay! Stay! DPRK! at six. That's three times more content!I also feel more compelled to play the other routes now that I've completed one. It gets very serious towards the end, even referencing thatpoor sap that tried to nab a propaganda poster.For reference (serious spoilers follow:)I got ""Apathy Is Death"", the ""harem"" ending that also ends with you renouncing your American citizenship and being stuck in the DPRK forever. It is the darkest timeline.Panzermadels, on the other hand, I felt would've had a lot of the same content in each route unless I stuck my barrel in crazy.Art and music have also received a substantial upgrade to ""average"". Hell, some of the backgrounds are even wallpaper-worthy, I'd say. Considering they were working with less than the average price of a used car, I'd say they did a good job.Characters, save for one person you meet towards the end, are fairly predictable. Not to say the story they tell isn't interesting, but as previous reviews have mentioned, your two choices are fairly archetypal.So what type of story do they tell? Surely you're curious how North Korea is portrayed in this piece of media. Satire is heavily employed, but for those who can't interpret that, there's also plenty of reminders that this is indeed North Korea, and therefore not a good place to live or visit. You aren't getting the wrong idea just because anime girls are on the screen and in uniform. I figured out fairly early why I was there, but didn't fully piece it together until the end. Despite its predictability, the going from tourist destination to tourist destination with the girls was fun! Be sure to stop by the Pueblo for a great photo of our sailors giving their detainers the respect they deserve.Overall, I'm bad at numbers, so I'd just say it's a quirky game that made me laugh out loud at the lighthearted parts and yell at my own mistakes towards the end. Out of ten. Pick it up if the price of a nice lunch doesn't deter you, or wait for it to be the price of a McDonald's lunch. And remember: post-launch sales are what fund the H-patch!"

,Recommended,512060,34426201,Posted: 22 August,all,plk Lesiak,"This game was a pretty big surprise to me - I kept my expectations rather low when approaching it, hoping for some decent humor, political and otherwise and a bit of absurd, fun dialogue. And I've found some seriously good writing, appropriately creepy totalitarian undertones and pretty impactful ending that made the whole story much more than just a distasteful joke many people make it out to be.While not a serious piece of political critique (or a serious romance when we look at that part of the equation), “Stay! Stay! DPRK” both manages to keep you entertained and smuggles a decent amount of information and insight into the reality of North Korea. While not dark enough to truly portray it and not without some factual mistakes, it’s actually decently researched and the storytelling is solid enough that it never feels like just an empty joke, exploiting the controversies it unavoidably creates by the sheer virtue of its setting.Also, without the 18+ patch (wasn’t interested in it really) even the fanservice seemed mild and rare enough to not make the game feel like an offensive excuse for Hentai scenes, and really those NSFW moments made a tiny fraction of the content presented. It also directly parodied “Go! Go! Nippon” with some of those scenes and they worked more as meta-jokes than actual fanservice for me. While the story is short, both girls were developed just well enough to not feel like empty silhouettes with boobs attaches – I actually liked them quite a lot by the end of the story and cared about what was going to happen to them. Authors of the game joke about it working as porn, but I don’t even think that’s the case, or at least it’s far from being its main focus.Even the production qualities had me positively surprised for a $10 VN, with the sprites, backgrounds and event-related illustrations being of a very nice quality (even if the very small cast of characters made it rather easy to achieve). Music didn’t catch my attention very much, but also never got in the way. In summary,I think this VN is worthy of recommendation, if you’re OK with some dark humor and don’t get offended by the topic itself. The optional 18+ patch gives you choice of how you want to experience it and the base content itself is surprisingly solid. If you approach it with open mind, it can provide you 6-7 hours of very decent entertainment, more or less worth the asking price and definitely worth it when bought on sale."

But I must say; the writing, artwork, and humor are all top notch.  I was expecting jabs at North Korea, and this game does have them, but not to the point where it is overbearing.  The dynamic between the protagonist and the two sisters works well and aided in drawing me into the story.  I ended up playing this game to the end, and found myself caring the the characters. It wasnt just another case of me going through the flow of beating another video game.  Well done.First Impression Gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh5PVlbrg44I recorded about 40 minutes worth of gameplay, but then decided to finish playing the game off camera.

The former game just seemed too rushed, low-budget and not very rewarding at the end of the day.Turns out I was wrong on this one!Stay! Stay! Democratic People's Republic of Korea!is actually a pretty decent Visual Novel, and a polished one at that. It has a very decent UI, detailed widescreen backgrounds, gorgeous CGs and sprites. Even the music is on-par with some of the professional VNs from Japan, with the catchy main menu theme sticking out. Speaking of that one, why are the lyrics in JAPANESE INVADER PIG-DOG LANGUAGE?Apart from that expect a standard visual novel with two girl routes. If you already played visual novels before, you know the deal. Focus on one girl, make decisions in favor of her and make her your waifu. Or don't choose any of the two girls like the indecisive wuss you are.What really makes this game unique is the setting though. No other video game comes into mind where you're able to daytrip North Korea, especially not if we consider the current news headlines regarding the bizarre East-Asian dictatorship.The game puts you in the shoes of[insert your name], an American veteran of the Afghanistan war who's about to visit his two penpals in North Korea. Well, turns out that his penpalsJoengandEunjiare in fact two busty sisters just waiting to put the protagonist in a harem situation and to show him around the country.While the story is clearly a black comedy with a grain of seriousness, you can definitely sense that the developers or at least the script writers took some effort by studying real-life North Korea. If you already read about stories from travelers who undertook trips to North Korea, you may recognise many details. In fact you may even learn a new thing or two about one of the world's most isolated countries.To see all of the endings and CGs you'll need about 6 hours. I think that's pretty good considering how well the small team behind this game pulled off this production.I definitely recommend it if you are into Visual Novels, black humor, memes, military topics and politics.

,Recommended,512060,32764562,Posted: 25 June,all,Senneca Syprian™,"""Stay! Stay! DPRK!"" is a well written, self -aware comedy/adult VN set in one of the most enigmatic and unconventional settings in the world. While it is not perfect, and a bit light on the ""adult content"" for my taste, the characters are well written, the dialogue is funny, and the setting is unique.You will need to suspend your disbelief pretty heavily going into this game. You play as a US marine who is visiting North Korea on vacation to meet up with penpals he met online. All of this is completely ridiculous and impossible, but hey, that's what we're doing, so just go with it. Upon arrival at the airport you discover your two penpals you assumed were male, are actually 2 beautiful sisters. You'll spend your weeklong vacation with the two of them, navigating both North Korean culture, and the girls' personalities.This is a VN, not a true ""game"" so you'll be spending most of your time reading. That being said, there are a few choices to be made and (I've only played through once) I think there are multiple endings, so I believe your choices do effect the final outcome. I'll have to do a second playthrough to be sure. One critisism is that one of the main characters as a plot point has terrible english, and speaks (text speaks, there is no voice acting) with a heavy accent in the first scene. Then, she magically speaks perfect (mostly) english throughout the rest of the story, even though the other characters continue to reference her ""terrible english"". It kinda breaks the immersion, and I wish they'd have kept the accent through the whole story.Also, the ending I ended up with got VERY dark, VERY fast, and ended pretty abruptly. Maybe there are more endings, but that kind of didn't fit with the rest of the game, and didn't leave me feeling satisfied with the end. Still, I enjoyed the ride.Given that it's a VN, I won't say much else about the story so I don't ruin anything for anyone. Besides, we both know why you're really here. There is a free (bonus points for being free!) patch availible from the developer that adds the nude scenes back into the game that steam made them take out. That being said, in my entire playthrough, I only saw 2 nude scenes, and none involving actual sex. Maybe it's possible to get more with different endings, but be warned, there may not be as much ""adult content"" as you might be expecting.If you've read this far, you're obviously someone who's interested, and likely someone who's played VNs before. If that's the case I would say buy the game. It's funny, It's entertaining, and there is replayability. I may update this review after my second playthrough, just to confirm that there are multiple endings, and if they include more ""adult content"", but even without that, I'd still say it's worth a playthrough if you're a fan of the genre.*UPDATE* 9-1-2017I have replayed the game a few times and can confirm there are multiple endings.Two of them are basically the same, and the other two (including the one I got in my original playthrough are ""bad"" endings. I would say the endings are the weakest point of the game. The ride was fun, but all endings left me feeling disapointed. Also while there is technically sex, it just consists of a nude pic, and textual implications. Nothing more."

I was honestly suprised how deep the rabbit hole goes with this one, both from a story and character perspective, and would not reccomend it for those VN readers looking for an, umm... quick fix. The story has message and heart, and like any good VN it puts that above sexy CG's, memetic humor, and fan service (though also like any good VN it has this in spades). Something really unique and important here."

Great Visual Novel parody to boot.I do kind of wish the story got to the shrine that was teased in Wonsan - I'm kind of curious as to what specifically it was can't tell readily from the web there are Buddhist Temples (or the ruins of one at least) but saw no mention of Confucian Shrines (or any other type for that matter except a Shinto one but that appears to have probably been destroyed post WWII - with avengence I would assume).

This game is worth getting murdered by having a stick shoved up my butt by Kim Jong-un while he calls me a naughty capitalist pig dog. I highly recommend this visual novel for those who enjoy top-tiered memes handpicked by the Glorious Leader himself. I'm sure if KJU's half-brother was still around, he would have fapped to this every morning and night. And so would I.But all jokes aside, this is an excellent visual novel with a fantastic story.

Yeah we get that you made it ""ironically"", but at least make your joke consistent.Let's start from the good part. The quality of the background CG is amazing. I like the vibrant color they use for the trees, the sky and the water, it is very refreshing to the eyes. The problem is, that kind of style does not fit the image of North Korea they are trying to present. It makes Pyongyang look like Singapore. Clean streets, shiny buildings. I have never been to Pyongyang, who knows if it actually looks like Singapore in real life, but if they want us to think North Korea is a poor, dysfunctional country, the CGs are not helping to that end.The writing is full of contradictions. Our main character is supposed to not know much about North Korea, but from time to time he cracks jokes about the Great Leader. Jokes based on the western media's info on the man - fat, likes basketball. And our MC manages to mistake Pyongyang as a suburb of Seoul. Yeah, right. Much of the humor in this game comes from the North Korean girls making mistakes in English. The jokes work well with Jeong, who is a fairly advanced English speaker. But when it comes to Eunji, I had to pause and think ""what is going on here"". Eunji flips between a fluent English speaker and a caricature of Asian people speaking English, and it's not clear if our MC is speaking Korean or English, and the result is I am confused. Besides, the writer uses way too much 4th wall jokes he just comes off as lazy and proud of it. At some point I just stopped thinking and clicked and clicked and laughed at the next tsundere gag that comes along. The ending was a huge disappointment - i thought it was going to lead somewhere, but then cue the accordion music. ""What the ♥♥♥♥"" indeed.Should you buy this game? It depends on what you expect. If you are looking for ""ironic"" jokes and anime tiddies, go for it. I came for the anime, so I guess it was money well spent. Still, it would be better if the game was more consistent overall, both in writing and visuals."

While not very long - it took me 3 hours to complete - the game is pretty decent for what it is; a ""Go! Go! Nippon!"" parody. A good one at that. Why is it a ""Go! Go! Nippon!"" Parody? Because the entire game is pretty much the same thing, only that instead of Japan (Nippon) you are in North Korea (True Korea!).The basic Plotline is the same thing as in ""Go! Go! Nippon!"". You are an American US Marine in the ""Waterdog"" unit (which in real life specializes on water treatment) and you know some penpal friends in the DPRK. Upon arriving there, you realize that your 2 male friends are not male, but 2 female soldiers in the Korean People's Army.As I guess characters tend to be in visual novels, the protagonist is the most blatant, unrelatable and naive character you've ever seen, and the game utilizes this for it's humor and some stereotype-jokes. However, the game doesn't take itself too seriously overall, and 4th wall breaking is a constant thing through the Protagonist's thoughts and almost every character's knowledge of the meta level and the 4th wall.Besides the humorous storytelling, the inside jokes that an unaware reader might skip, and the hilariously cliche-fueled perspective of North Korea, the game also allows you to actually date the 2 main girls/waifus, Jeong and Eunji. While that doesn't influence the story too much - the story that only really comes into play in the last 15 minutes anyway - it is still a nice aspect that is fun on one hand, as well as another cliche on the huge pile of stereotypes this game reinforces.Game also features some CGs of the girls besides the normal dialogue artwork, fap potential still limited however.Overall good game."

I have yet to finish, but I'm sure I'll have a good time, and I'll play it several times to get the different endings."

Those who enjoyed Panzermadals and Go Go Nippon will definitely enjoy the casual story laced with anime, military, contemporary, and brick jokes.Stay evil, you capitalist pigs."

It mixes facts with memes into this funny yet not offensive game, except some parts, which may be a little out there, but it is just a game, you just gotta know when its a jolk or not while playing. I haven't encoumtered a problem playing it besides the part where you have to save and load, I wish there was an autosave for every transition. Like seriously, it froze on me, and I didnt save and I had to speedrun it until I went back to where I left off. Its a pain to say the least. Overall tho, great game devs.P.S.- You also need some knowledge or background info on ""True Korea"" to tell if somethings are a jolk or not, but we all know a little about True Korea to know its in a bad shape rn. I also hate everybody saying this game is offensive, its not offensive. You just have to either take it like a jolk or not rant at all, cuz at the end of the day, ur making urself look like a fool cuz there's nothing wrong with the game."

Story was generally charming, though I would have liked -* more choices. Maybe this is a VN thing but the game feels very linear.* The humour in the game seemed to rely on understanding military references so I didn't really get it, and it kinda felt like it was written by a solider. I felt more like the writer was a former solider than I was playing one.* Better use of sound effects would have been good.* The ""tutorial"" was waaaay too long. I almost quit the game for good at 30 minutes in as nothing interesting happened. The story could have used with a more aggressive start than going through the mundane of getting off a plane.Other than that the story was charming enough to keep me engrossed for a few hours so that's a definite positive, but I do feel some of the negatives could have been addressed better."

The characters are at the edge of annoying trope but somehow make it hilarious. The characters could use a little more development, but this is a 10 dollar game so why am I complaining? Its a great visual novel if you dont only like visual novels for sex scenes and 50 hours of replayability or dialague easter eggs. I would say I do have the motive of completing it which there are 4 secret photos you can find. A perfect visual novel experience for 10 bucks."

The art is georgous, the english is good and the story is decent.  The software is solid and works.  The girls are nice and the CGs are well drawn but very tame (even with the patch).  What is it these days with eroge not having any real H content?  Anyway, it's funny, cute and a pleasant ride."

If this was not a parody then I might pick on the storyline/characters a bit for shallowness but since it is, I will just say it's fun. Both the writing and artwork are great, I will be looking into previous/future releases from this creator due to its excellent quality. Overall I would say 9/10On a more serious note; I would like to add that this game is a good reminder that even a country like NK is full of mostly normal people trying to survive what life throws at them.On a less serious note; those looking for -H- scenes won't find them, even with the 18+ patch. Just a few nude (but very well drawn) pictures are added in."

Might update this review if a better/different ending comes up in the other routes.A funny and charming experience in North Korea through the eyes of an American on vacation. It's not a very long visual novel (at least for the oneand bestroute that I've completed thus far), but the ride is a wholly enjoyable one. My only gripe was the ending, which left a little to be desired. It's notbadper se, but people looking for a conclusive epilogue may be left a little disappointed. Still, get this for the journey, not the destination; on that front, Stay! Stay! DPRK! definitely delivers.TL;DR: A solid 8/10. North Korea isDEFINITELYbest Korea."

The comedy stays funny throughout and there are a ton of references and callbacks to enjoy. I wish the choices during gameplay actually affected the story more so than invisibly deciding the ending, but the game has enough appeal that it doesn't really matter. Would definitely recommend, even if you're not a fan of this type of game, like I wasn't."
