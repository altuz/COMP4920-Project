This feels like a demo-there is only 1 ski course and you start from the beginning every time, and there are no other features other than going down that 1 hill in this game.If more was added ie. tubing, snowboarding, multiple tracks etc then I would recommend this but I just cant at this point."
,Recommended,512080,24805384,"Posted: 9 August, 2016",all,Bakfyr,"OK, I've made two seperate attempts at this, each one was for 12 minutes for a total of 24 minutes so far.The first time was so overwhelming that I was literally falling over as I took the huge jumps into deep valleys. My stomach was in my mouth, the way a rapid drop from heights would do (not VR sickness). As I hit the ground in VR, my knees and legs were instinctively trying to balance me in real life. SO hard to explain. I took the headset off and giggled. The experience completely fooled my brain.So, about an hour later, I tried again. This time I kept telling myself ""this isn't real"", and I was able to actually play and enjoy it. Within minutes, and after crashing multiple times, I totally got it. Bending your knees, and leaning is the key to this. When flying thru the air into a deep valley, and a massive boulder is in your path, all I can recommend is either lean over far enough to avoid it (you seem to have control while catching air), or CLOSE YOUR EYES as you smash into it.I highly recommend this for those that want to crash dive into building VR sickness resistance. Once you build up tolerance in this VR sim, you will be able to play in VR game that uses motion to move around. Hopefully developers will stop thinking we're all a bunch of pansies, and start making games that we can 'walk within the VR environment', like these guys developed.Good job developers. But, it needs polish for sure. Like please include menu options to disable 'in game' music so I can hear my own music."

76561198020445786,Not Recommended,512080,30312148,Posted: 4 March,all,M1ng0J1ng0,"6.6 out of 10As long as you understand this doesn't intend to be any kind of realistic skiing sim then it's good fun. It's very immersive using your hands to row the ski poles to build speed. It's intensive as the difficultly builds up over the course, I haven't mananged to reach the end due to colliding with swooping eagles partway through; as I said this isn't a simulator.As there's really nothing out there to compare to this, its as good as it gets. Which is a shame as Fancy Skiing shows proof of concept that skiing works great in VR. Fancy Skiing ""isn't"" exactly an awesome game, it's just one long course, and there are no other options. Some of shortcomings in the production include, your virtual skis always point forward, and the music can't be turned off (which can get annoying over times). Basically it's pretty barebones, lacks polish, but sort of priced around being acceptable value.Though I quite enjoy this game, as a rating I'd give it average as an objective game rating. If a more refined skiing title comes along, get that and avoid Fancy Skiing as it's shortcoming will be revealed and this title will easily be forgotten. Giving it a thumbs up is a real stretch. I doubt this game would get so many thumbs up is there was something else/better out there."

The main problem is there is only one level and it just seems to loop through the same part of the game over and over. If  you die you can sometimes start over, but sometimes it just freezes and you need to shut the game down and start it up again (also the text switches from English into Chinese). It's fun, but not for the $10 price tag. Maybe if there was quite a bit more content it would be worth it."

It's fast and it's going downhill (in a good way).It's an arcade type game, you try to avoid trees, boulders etc to survive. You have skiing poles to add speed, and this feels very natural actually (disclaimer; my knowledge of skiing irl is very limited). You turn to the side by kinda tilting your head, and this doesn't make sense to 100% at the beginning. My feeling is that it should be a little more sensitive, but after a few rounds you'll get the hang of it.At first I played with bent knees and leaning a bit forward, great for the sense of speed and immersion, but maybe a little harder to navigate. Standing straight with the feet a bit apart seemed to be a bit easier. And as you can regulate your own speed you can also choose if you want to go furiously wild or a bit slower and more tactical.You'll crash alot, but you'll do better every time as you learn the course. The longer you stay alive, the more points you get. Also seems to be getting points for hitting deer, and there is a snowflake on the score-board that I have no idea what it is yet.The game runs without any problem on my GTX 1070 with 1.5 SS. I have never had any motion sickness so I don't know how this is for the pukers.I'll put this game in my daily rotation for sure. If you like games like ""Unbreakable VR Runner"" then I believe this will be for you. Also it might be a good game to demo to people, because it's not like anything else at the moment.+ Fun, fast, original- €7.99 would be a more fair priceThere is also some minor translation errors, but nothing important.Good work!"
,Not Recommended,512080,24979842,"Posted: 17 August, 2016",all,ForceKin,"The price is a complete rip-off. While the game can be fun, there's nothing to it other than repeatedly going down the same course over and over. It kept my attention for all of 12 minutes before I was bored with it. Also, the controls are not ideal. You steer by tilting your head. Not moving it, tilting it. As in, tilt your head 45 degrees to the right to go right. It would be far more intuitive, I think, to have you tilt the controllers as you would with skipoles when actually skiing, although I suppose that might take away from the sense of speed some. For $2.99 it would be alright, but for $10 it's a joke."

It has a single piece of music that wouldn't be entirely out of place in an 80s ski movie.  It's called ""Fancy Skiing VR"".  It contains wonky English.  You'll look like you're doing pelvic thrusts while playing.  I enjoy these things way more than I should, and I'm having a blast playing it in short spurts.As far as being a ski game, I wouldn't exactly call it exquisitely visually realistic or hugely varied like some other ski games, but you can see that in the trailer.  More importantly to me, *this* game has controls which are well-suited to its arcadey nature, and pretty good in general, given the current state of VR.  One could go further by sitting in a swivel chair with Lighthouse markers strapped to your feet or something, but that's not possible at the moment.  Maybe something could be done with planting poles for sharper turns, but that's not necessary given the current nature of this game, and it might end up causing disorientation.  Here, it's simple head-tilting to steer, trigger to jump the fences, and actual ski pole thrusting to get going on the flats!Might be good to avoid if the trailer turns you off, but I'm glad I bought it."

Really works well in VR.. so much so that you have to be careful not to fall over whilst playing - perhaps it should start with a nursery slope level with a ski instructor !? ;)It's a little bit like Subway Surfer and has the same 'just one more go' feel..  however there's more substance here.. it actually has pretty decent graphics, runs smooth and whilst you couldn't say it's a 'ski simulator', it's starting to get close - just look around at the scenery as you ski down.Of all our games this is the one that gets played *every* time the Vive is turned on..  just to try to get a little bit further on.Highly Recommended"

And it wasn't just me, as I watched my friends do the same, good times. After some runs and being more stable on my feet I can really enjoy the huge jumps and high speeds, great way to move forward compared to the teleporting you'll find in most other places.On a more critical note, as a game it does have just one track, and the bird attacks are annoying at best. Skis are not always in the right position and steering left and right could be improved upon so it does not just track the tilt of the headset, its sideways movement should have more impact on steering.I think the price is acceptable for this small game, I have seen much worse VR games and experiences in this range and above. This game is easily one of the best VR experience so far, which has provided lots of fun, sweat and tears."

A VR game that lets you feel like you're going fast while you're standing still. The main reason I decided to write this review is because I don't see it being mentioned what the format of this game actually is:This game is a platformer. Your objective is to get down the hill as fast as possible without hitting the obstacles... or falling prey to Alfred Hitchcock birds.Some people may call it unfair or poor design but, personally I see it as a puzzle. Yes there are times where, if you don't know which side of the slope you need to be on ahead of time, you'll slam straight into a rock with no time to react. You remember which side to be on and do that next time around and you're fine.As a side note, I think this game has single-handedly fixed the circulation problems in my arms and hands."

I usually have my family members play ""Waltz of the Mage"" as an into game and when they want to try something else its hard to find a good change of pace game. I used to have them do Lab but this is much better. It gives you a feel of real movement that no other VR game I have played to date has given you. I had several family members screaming and falling over ""safely"" trying to get into it and they each loved it.If you are a hardcore solo VR gamer this is not for you. It has limited replay value but it is a great addition to the collection for friends family."
,Recommended,512080,24929085,"Posted: 15 August, 2016",all,StylixDS,"This is a decent title for what it is. It's a simple vr experience that is fun in small doses but the lack of different courses to pick from makes it get repetative rather quickly. Also the game could use some vibration feedback to help immerse the player. The steering feels a bit awkward too but it works enough to be fun.One thing it really needs to the ability to mute the music though. The track isn't the worst thing to listen to, but it gets old fast. It would be nice to have the option to turn it off so you could listen to your own stuff without having to sacrifice the game sounds as well.This is one of those cheap titles that is worth grabbing if you like sharing VR with family and friends and seeing their reactions. It probably won't have a lot of lasting appeal if you only play VR alone."

Which only takes a couple of seconds so it wasn't much of a hassle.I also got stuck in the ground which made me slow. But jumping got me out of there.All by all it is a fun fairly priced game.What I would like to see added if the dev reads this:Being able to lean your whole body instead of just tilting your head to steerJumping by actually doing a little hop instead of just the triggersHitting deer shouldn't punish you by slowing you down, if it is part of the scoreBoosts, coins, big jumps and traps.

,Recommended,512080,24813580,"Posted: 10 August, 2016",all,Rafport,"I had many doubts about purchasing Fancy Skiing, as the game seems to be very sickening in videos (also very fun!): in general I find that quality software need to be inclusive. I must say that on this side, the game is pretty good: the comfort is similar to a cockpit game, here it lacks a reference frame but also miss any rotation of the screen (the most toxic movement in VR, who comes from DK1-2 knows) so there are only three-axis acceleration but no rotation. The fact you need to move a lot is also good, because your balance is not 100% on the vection side (it's also nice as a workout). Basically, if the slightest movement is nauseating maybe you can't play with Fancy Skiing, but you don't need an iron stomach to be able to play, I'll rate just a bit less comfortable than Hover Junker but way more comfortable than any FPS kind of locomotion. Sorry for the long description with my crappy english, but I would like to get those information before buy so I hope could be helpful for someone.As a game, it's not very polished at the moment (just out from a day o two) and it's one of smaller download I've ever seen, almost 80MB, so don't expect ton of contents or surprising graphics. Anyway it's fun, I mean real fun, you move your stick to gain speed and it's just stunning how natural it feels. For turning, it's a bit weird because the game use your head's inclination: in real world, the centrifugal force make you lean without falling, but here (if you want to play stand, as I suppose it's more fun and real) you're forced to open a lot your legs for stay in balance. With some practice you can achieve to manage it, but controls in general need some works, they're a bit too rough.The game don't own (at the moment at least) torunaments, tracks or any kind of variation. But, for what I saw, it offer a single track with an increasing difficulty. So, like a good old coinop, it's focused on super short sessions (it's game over in minutes) where you learn how to progress with trials and errors. I like this way more than usual endless/random waves (in this case, waves of obsacles) because actually you can progress in it. I've not play the game enough to say about how long it is, or how challenging it is, I hope it's a good mix bethween being too easy, crazy difficult and short. Anyway, being a brand new experience for Vive users, it worth his price just for be able to ski in VR."

I slide about really fast even before standing on the skis, any amount of leaning doesnt seem to turn so I always smash into something really fast and feel like im going to fall over. If the controls were more forgiving, I think I'd quite like it."

Once you figure it out though it is lots of fun.  I start every day by going down the slopes a few times trying to beat my high score.  This is also a great game to show people VR.  Video recording them as they fly into a rock is priceless.

I tried it sitting down first which was a good idea. My 50+ year old mother insisted on standing up while playing and I had to hold her so she didn't fall down. She said this game deserves an awesome review, so our rating is 9/10. The motion is okay but getting the rythym down for the ski poles is hard. Great game"

Everyone almost falls over.I don't get motion sickness on this one for some reason. Just funny jello legs!
76561198062441031,Recommended,512080,26493329,"Posted: 8 November, 2016",all,Filbab6,"Somehow this game keeps you coming back for more. The reason i say 'somehow' is because even when you finish the  track and it  loops back you just want to keep going on...and on . Don't get me wrong Its really  enjoyable.IMHO it  just needs some tweaKS. For example, clearer scoring system, maybe bonuses for longer airtime, using ramps (hitting/avoiding reindeer, currently not sure if thats a positive or a negative??). Different 'runs' , maybe a deadly black run for the more advance skier ...cough cough. How about a 'ski jump'  mode scored on hangtime and distance?. Ghost run, so you can mirror the best time/score .  Split times or check points.  Touch pad tricks , pre pick your fave moves and then mid air press to perform? just a few suggestions for the devs. Great party game. We love it, great competitive banter to be had.  As they say in Huddersfield  F#@k the tile!!."

Really exhilarating and very instinctive, takes only a few minutes to get used to the movement.  Even my kids were flying through the course after only 10 minutes of playing.  No feeling of nausea either.I hope the developer goes on to add more courses to add more interest, as the game mechanics are fine.Fully recommended!"

To sum up: perfect game to experience virtual reality. It is quite short so you'll probably quit it after few hours of play.
