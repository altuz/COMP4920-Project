,Recommended,512220,32554355,Posted: 18 June,all,Tim Chaos the Bus Driver,"This game is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated dungeon crawlers out there. The swords and bows all work just as good as other games entirely devoted to one or the other. There's a huge variety in weapons and a few different enemies with readable attack animations that require parrying. There isn't physics based attacks (a weak swing will do the same damage as a strong one), but that's so you can feel powerful as you plow down the oncoming waves, and you DO have to attack around shields and armor. The snarky JARVIS-like companion's quips add a bunch of fun as well.This is my go-to game when I want to play with both melee and ranged weapons. The frequent updates tell me that this game's future is in good hands!"

You start in your hub / home fortress and use the portal to venture on missions in different zones. The combat is pretty arcadey with all the spells and hit effects flying around, but has a very satysfying feel. The procedural levels really add to replayability. A great break from the wave shooters out there.The Gameplay.The game takes place on procedural levels, where you punch your way through groups of enemies to reach your goal. There are four quests types available, with very different mechanics and skills needed to complete them. And whats most important - they are actually fun! Running from a flying crystal shooting death rays, ending a crow infestation or taking on an orc general - feels great. That gives great hope for the future content, but at the moment is a little repetitive after your first 10 or so levels. Looking forward for future updates.The VisualsThe game is not realistic, by any means, but it has a very consistent, kinda toon art style. It fits well with the setting of the game. The floating islands are great to look at and you'll definitely find some epic vistas. Some FX look a little too flat up close and could be improved, but its not going to bother you in the middle of the combat.The Enemies.Simply put - well designed and fun to fight. The orcs vary vastly in terms of what they can do, while their designs make it easy make out squishies in the group. Some will shield others with their magic, some will perform some crazy jump attacks at you and there is that one that creates floating, life-sucking area denial orbs that you'll learn to avoid really quickly. While the animations in general look very fluid, the lack of ragdoll whatsover leaves bodies stuck in terrain if they died on a steep slope. Also, I want to be able to stab a dead orc. I need it in my life.The development.The developer is definitely a strong point here. Engaged with the community, sounds like a guy with a vision and pushes the updates consistently. Carry on like this and the game may just become one of the best fantasy games on vive.Worth it? Ow yeah!Overall, its a really fun title, well worth the 10$. If you enjoy light-hearted fantasy action and want a break from wave shooters, look no further!"

In addition the floating corpses that are left when the islands float away  feels really weird when you are playing.Besides the points made above the game works fine.Would love to see*    1)The ability to either switch bow size or be able to pull back the bowstring further2)A high score list local and global*Has been addressed by the devs and the ability to change it is now available.

,Recommended,512220,29465059,Posted: 24 January,all,Neosage,"At first I was hesitant to buy this game....another tech demo? Another repetitive gameplay? Where are the map exploring survival/open world/crafting/action/adventure fallout 4/skyrim based gameplay I have come to know and love? I mean procedural dungeon crawler? If I gave a nickel everytime I heard that, I'd probably be pist poor enough to be unable to buy this game but as it turns out....Well as a Rifter since release, owning quite a few VR games already from both Oculus and Steam (List Below), I can safely say this is the closest I've felt in true action FPS RPG compared to any other game on the market for Rift, including Raw Data, which comes in second. Where Raw Data fails, Trickster thrives with its namesake, 'Procedural generated maps' with procedural generated quests. Where Raw Data is static map with incoming waves,Trickster has adventure and waves.The only thing that of course will be its downfall is again its name...procedural generated relies completely on its base foundation...if the seed does not give enough complex variables, most often you will feel repetition (ie. No Man's Sky), however considering the many VR games out there (Vanishing Realms excluded for Rift), it still one up's my 2nd best VR game, Raw Data because the variables still expand more from the original game play thus giving me more to feel and embrace from your typical VR gaming experienceThe weapon switching gives a small but arguably more progressive approach toward Action Adventure where inventory slots are concerned thus at least achieving the feel of items with light/latern in dark maps. You will have not two but three weapons at your disposal, executing all three weapons whilst moving? Priceless, indeed you will definitely feel like a badass but in this mode you will start to realise the God-like potential of what is to come...Triple A Fantasy Action Adventure FPS RPG. You will notice it when you start to flow with your items, how you skillfully weave weapon switches from bow to arrow killing with both strikes...we havent even involve magics yet...The motion sickness problem is solved for the RPG genre thanks to trickster, indeed, it played a trick with our mind and vision with ingenius smooth turning and twin sticks with a slap of teleport, they might have set the stage for all the VR RPG of the future. Ultimately, Trickster has tricked its way like any good Loki would into my admiration as an Action RPG VR goto game as of now, Jan 2017Neo's Oculus Rift Top 10:1) Trickster VR2) Raw Data3) Arizona Sunshine (Too short for the asking price, not horrifying enough and graphics for a zombie game already outrivaled by Resident Evil)4) The Ark: Survival VR (Seated but is an open world crafting survival and multiplayer capable)5) The Unspoken -  (MOBA) 1 v 1 (Mage Duel)6) Ripcoil (What Tron Disc gameplay would have been, its free and its a fresh new take of competitive court based gameplay)7)Dead and Buried - MOBA 2 v 2 (Gunslinger duels and defend mode)8)Subnautica (Like the Ark, a pc based survival exploration game turned VR. Low ranked because of current horrible motion sickness issues, could learn a thing or two from Trickster but the beauty of exploration in Subnautica is unrivaled at the moment)9)Discovering Space (Im glad and proud that the human race decided to build this first compared to any triple A VR game, because everything in this space traveling exploration simulator is true to life detail except for the ship you are traveling in which is capable of FTL speeds)10)Bigscreen Beta and Dota 2 are weirdly the only two places where I have truly met people and converse generally like I was sitting on a sofa across them, and I feel it is currently VR's highlighted social spots that will grow with the community as time passes"
76561198343555681,Recommended,512220,26496689,"Posted: 8 November, 2016",all,RustyHugh,"So here is my review after first 3 hours in this game.The combat is fun. Its a great mix between realistic and arcade. Coming from vanishing realms, where you have one or two enemies charging at you at a time, it feels much more chaotic, but in a good way. You can play defensively by taking your shots and blocking / parrying every attack, but I found it more fun just to dive head first into the enemies and slash and hack with my sword and shield like a mad man. It can get pretty difficult though, when each of the orcs throws their magic gimmic at you and you have to figure out what exactly is eating away your health and how to avoid it. Not exactly Dark Souls, but not a walk in the park either.The graphics are simple, but well done. The bright colors and color palette realy matches the mood of the game. Sound is just what is should be, with some epic music tracks thrown in the mix.The strongly advertised procedural levels actually work pretty good. You start to see some repeating tiles after a few hrs, but every level is very different from another and with 3 or 4 weather settings (green, snow, desert + day/night cycle) you never know what's around the corner. High replayability value here.And, you also get the typical wave attack game mode with this one as well if you're into those. I like the procedural levels more, but its still pretty well done. More interesting and dynamic with all the islands flying in/out than most similar titles ive played.Get it. A great addition to any vr library."

Vanishing Realms feels slow, Gorn is a physics playground. This one here - I see myself coming back to this for a long time. The combat feels very dynamic and varied with all the different enemies and combos they put together. Weapons offer differnt playstyles which are all satisfying to use (I have some experience in real-life sword fighting so you can take my word for it, or try it yourself). Occasional glitches like enemies stuck on terrain never break the game for me. The graphics are polished and well thought-out. Overall, you won’t find similar value for money in other vr titles. Grab it!"

It enables you to move forward/back and strafe left/right with your left stick and smooth turning in the right stick. You can now move, block and slash all at the same time!The dev implemented this feature based on user feedback and is proven to be focused and active.Strong VR FPS are few and far between, but in my eyes this has just become one of them and earned my full recommendation. Buy this now!"
,Recommended,512220,28675200,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Cyda,"A great bow and sword game for VR. Fun and frantic gameplay, good art design and a very attentive developer. I love the progression in the game and it has been great fun unlocking each of the weapons and trying to find the ones I don't have.It's early access so not quite perfect yet as is to be expected but even at this stage of early access it's really fun and I would totally recommend it - by the time it hits full release I can see the developer turning this in to something special.Edit after EA update 11: The 'Twin Sticks' locomotion and the way the 'Teleport' locomotion in implemented in this game are an example of how VR locomotion should be done and because of it the game works great on both Vive and Rift. If only every developer would add these same locomotion options, we'd have the options to suit everyone and all games would be open to all VR users regardless of their model or sensor setup.I own about 40 VR games and the locomotion options in this game are up there with the best of them. None do it better."

I know my money didn't go to waste. I like that you guys are constantly letting the people know what's going on. I have tried out the experimental Adventure mode and have had some fun in doing so!One thing I do recommend is to change the rotation of the arrows when they are shot same with the throwing knives. Make it so that the rotation is based off of the rigidbody gravity. Just google how to do it. It will honestly make the game 5x better just for me. Also consider some different types of movement in the adventure title. I got quite bored teleporting 2 ft in front of me over and over. Maybe make like some small portals that warp you across bigger areas? Just food for though.I would rate this a 8/10 for it's early access and look forward to what you guys can do on it.

The game play -- while relatively simple -- is addicting and always diverse enough to keep things interesting. There are no barrels to break or treasures you pick up off goblin bodies. Instead, this is realistic -- in your face -- action like only VR can do. It's a fantastic bow and arrow simulator (or sword simulator... or knife throwing simulator) that really gets your heart pumping with the realistic feeling action fought amongst procedurally generated castles in the sky. This one is a must have for VR for the Vive."

76561197993554897,Recommended,512220,29547801,Posted: 28 January,all,zygoatboy,"A most excellent game. Completely emersive and unique VR setting, incredible combat mechanics and a great deal of all round fun. The game currently in early access, symultaneously infuses the player with the sense that they are a one person orc killing machine and also provides a robust challenge on some of the later levels.The weapon mechanics are intuitive and offer a range of tactical approaches. The orcs themselves have a range of different skill sets that one has to adjust to, and one has to constantly work with the procedurally generated environments on the fly to gain the tactical advantage. I have found myself sprinting for higher ground to spring an ambush on some approaching orcs, 'hiding' in some tall grass near the bottom of some stairs and picking off orcs or throwing myself into battle with axe swinging wildly. All of it sweaty, triumphant unbelievable fun.It ticks a couple of boxes as a VR game. There is a compelling adventure element, where the emersion in VR gives a profound sense of presence on the surreal floating landscapes. The ranged combat is slick and easy to learn, slightly more challenging to master, and up close melee is satisfyingly chaotic and exhillerating. The game's RPG elements are growing and I look forward to future developments.A couple of humble suggestions: It would be next level awesomeness to possibly have items or clothes that adjust movement tactics: shoes that allow a character to dash larger distances into the thick of battle to do wreak havok and then escape (alla Sairento's leap). Clothes that limit movement a little more but give extra protection or offer up extra powers and features. Would be amazing to tweak your character into a DPS assassin, rumbling tank or powered up mage. Upgrade to the current weapons (via gems or shards) would potentially give further control to the player to tweak and personalize their build and their tactics. Would also help alot with replayability. And of course more variety of bad guys. But looking at the range of regular updates and responsivness from the developers, it seems they have got all of it in hand.All in all, my favourite game to play with the Vive."

It's much faster nad more combat oriented than Vanishing Realms and more light-hearted in effects and visuals than QuiVR. Its a great title jump in to relax after work and there is no better way to do it than turning some orcs into pin cushions.

Challenging at higher levels, can get overwhelming and break immersion here too. Improvements to melee combat would help this. For $13, this game is great, there are updates often, each containing a plethora of new content.Pros:Visuals are very niceDifferent ""biomes""- moving from the initial bright landscape to the dark snowy one, was quite surprising (in a very good way)Simple - swing, throw, draw a bow - can't get any simplerMany weapons to choose from - compliments playstyleDifferent movement options - locomotion and teleport, can use both at the same time as well!Ranged weapons are satisfying.Bows with different abilities, even though they're still bows, their powers differ, this is nice. It feels like a different weapon.Basic loadout system, melee, range, and equipment.Many levels - challenging along with some basic ones.Cons:Can get repetitive - mostly the melee combatMelee combat can use some work - swinging is good and all, a little more physics feedback (idk how this will be done) would be nice.Combat isn't as enjoyable when you get overwhelemd. (Being under pressure is a good thing, but when 10 orcs are intantly upon you due to a balloon drop and the melee combat isn't as enjoyable, then the immersion sort of breaks down.Variation in enemies Imore below)Suggestions for the dev:Melee combat - I want to be able to block with my sword, and have the enemies react accordingly.Boss battles - (not the blue guys, but the commanders), have less enemies and enhance the boss's melee abilities, such that you can react and have to skillfully beat him."

It's refreshing. Mechanically though, this is definitely a fun combat system and it's got some great ideas behind it. I love that level select is stabbing a knife into the map. Genius. I do have one piece of feedback though. Of the two bow options. I would hands down choose the piercer but as it fires differently to normal arrows, it's impossible to aim. I would suggest some kind of magical laser sight, perhaps extend some blue particles ahead of it. Not all the way.

In fact it really doesn't make sense to have the locomotion on your sword hand at all.2) The ememy keeps running way too close to me. It makes it too easy to beat them. They should come close enough to strike but far enough away that I can't just swing blindly from behind my shield and still kill them.

The game has a lot of custimizability when it comes to any VR user's preferences, including almost ALL sorts of locomotion options including a 'vignette' on/off, and four movements methods including teleport, and multiple stick options. The new Twinstick movement the best implementations of full-range joystick movement I have used so far.

The enemies are all very unique and can easily be differentiated from one another on the battlefield. I feel like the archers are a bit strong, but that just goes to show that there is a good challenge here. I found myself dying more than once simply because I did not handle the situation correctly, and that's significantly better than dying because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t enemies. It's a great game, and an amazing VR title. I would recommend to anyone!"
,Recommended,512220,33648932,Posted: 19 July,all,Conargle,"TL:DR - Straight up fun. 9/10 and a great addition to any VR games library.4 different movement types to choose from, i personally go for teleportation and a mix of locomotion/turning because i have a small play area. I can sprint around with one vive touchpad and use the other to turn either a set amount of continuously like a thumbstick (which does invoke a bit of motion sickness in me, but its well worth it for being able to fine tune the direction you're running in without having to turn your body if you're limited for space like me) but then i use the teleport as a form of quick dash to escape enemies closing in on me.Each weapon has a special ability which you charge up by doing damage, you can have 2 in your loadout. the dual crossbows is my favourite by far and the reloading feels amazingly satisfying. In fact the weapons in general are amazingly satisfying, an upward swing to the chin with a sword will send most unarmored enemies flying after a perfectly timed block. Alternatively, you could just stand in front of an enemy with your shield up and just wiggle your sword in their face for cheap shots.Did i mention enemies are armored? and its not just a visual thing, you need to swing at their fleshy parts if you want to use a sword. if youre a bow user and they have a helmet, then its really satisfying getting that headshot through the gap in their faceplates.Throwing weapons are a thing, you get an infinite amount with a cooldown like a special ability. my favourite are the 3 throwing knives positioned at the front of your waist as if tucked into a belt. you throw all 3 at once in a fan shape and it makes me feel like a rogue/assassin. I've also seen a magic bomb/potion type thing on another player but i havent unlocked it myself yet. It looks fun though.Graphically, i love the style of it, and supersampling keeps it really sharp and clean to look at at, even distant objects.The levels are technically randomly selected rather than ""generated"". Each level has specific tilesets that are chosen at random and connected together differently each time you load a level, a bit like the levels in warframe for example.The difficulty seems pretty balanced so far, Some levels harder than others because the difficulty is level based rather than a single setting you pick at the beginning of the game.Each difficulty make the enemies tougher and i think spawning more of them. This difficulty is then scaled further when you have more people playing together like in Diablo.There are unique boss type enemies which, unlike normal grunts that only... grunt, the bosses will talk♥♥♥♥♥♥and be all intimidating which is amusing to hear at a distance when you're closing in on them and killing all their minions.I can't speak too much for multiplayer, the most expirience i've had with that was when i was playing solo and some guy joined me halfway through a level and stuck around for a few more. He had unlocked more weapons than me and was clearly more experienced, however it doesn't throw off game balance at all as theres no leveling system that im aware of. he may have had different weapons but in terms of damage output, he was equally as useful as i was, making the combat more skill based than just being overpowered and destroying everything.Reviving dead teammates in multiplayer is a pretty tough thing. If you die mid-fight then you're probably dead for the rest of that encounter. You revive by holding your trigger over the teammates body and it fills up a meter. Which is pretty tough to do if you're being rushed by enemies. However, i have managed to do it when fighting against only archers. You just hide behind your shield blocking all arrows and revive them that way.Side note: the bar doesn't decay or lose progress at all if you stop reviving so the skilled player could probably run circles around the enemy, leading them away, then coming back to revive, then leading them away, then coming back to finish the revive. It doesn't take long at all to revive someone, but the enemy move surprisingly fast.The only issue i've encountered so far, are the various Ballistas generated in the world. Sometimes they're in good positinos, other times not so much. Also, aiming them is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to deal with if you're playing in a small standing area like me, even with thumbstick like movements available. I decided to just give up and run circles around the enemies firing my crossbows at them instead for the first ""defend the area"" type section.Overall it's a solid underrated dungeon crawler, most VR games i feel are too expensive, with barely enough content to make your money worthwhile (the whole £1/$1 per hour of fun thing), But with this game being only £10, in theory that's 10 hours of fun, but im certain im going to play this for many many more, especially for the amount of content in it, especially since they're still updating it and adding more."

I am almost completly immune to motion sickness and as such I can't really tell how good/bad it is but I think it is way better than other games at the moment.The enemy response is almost as good as in non-VR games and it really feels like you stab and slash your enemies. If you hit them from below with an upward-move you can send them flying, stabbing them in the head kills them instantly (with some exceptions, the Balrog wouldn't go down after one blow either). There are some quirks every now and then but I never encountered anything game breaking. Sometimes an enemy gets stuck inside a rock, but hey, that's where those pesky orcs belong!The weapon arsenal is fun to explore and try out. The different weapons offer new ways of playing the game, from the sword & shield warrior to the hammer swinging barbarian, you can pretty much play however, or whoever you want.For an EA-title this one does provide several hours of fun, way more than some finished titles present to you. We actually tried it as a party game, testing who could survive the wave mode the longest.Last but not least, the community around the game as well as the dev team seem to be really cool guys, as the game gets a lot of input from players and the devs actually listen to it.If you are still unsure: In any case it is worth a try! Steam refund system is there, but you won't need it here!"

The bow is a sweet main weapon with two other weapons you can use as well a sword or throwing daggers. The monsters come in waves and keep you guessing where they will come from. Pretty immersive travil with remote teleport but feels like you are walking when monsters are closing in on you can be pretty intense when you have 3 or 4 minions closing in on you.

There is a sense of progression when unlocking new weapons. I can't decide if I prefer using touchpad walk or teleport to advance through stages while I'm looking for chokepoints to funnel enemies into. Each stage has a clear objective with waypoints, which I find especially helpful as I am the type who frequently gets lost.The greatsword feels quite different from holding a sword and shield. Like the bow and arrow you are provided when you start the game, you can activate a special ability with touchpad after you've landed enough shots.Dual Wielding Crossbows are a nice new way to interact with the game and adds a run -n- gun feeling to combat. The reload mechanic is simple enough; simply rotate/flick the controllers to the sides. You can do this as you're using touchpad walk, and can even shoot while using touchpad walk. This grants players the option to stay mobile and to conitnue having some form of offense while respositioning.There are either six or 7 enemy models currently. The combination of exploration and tactical positioning for combat preparedness makes it easy to lose count. I'm looking forward to what developments will come next. So far, I'm not disappointed, at all."

Don't look for rows of stats and health bars - you won't find it here (and there is no place for that in VR i think!). Instead, you'll find great combat system, with simplified blocking and parrying and great bow gameplay (think Lab's Longbow with magic superpowers).

It's already in a state where it's worth more than the purchase price, and it also keeps getting pretty frequent updates. There are a decent number of VR games in this genre, but this one stands out as both showing great promise for it's future as well as already being in a pretty great place.First thing I'd like to mention is the wide array of control options. You'll likely find a movement style that suits you. Second is the choice of weapons, as you progress through the game you'll work up to a pretty sizeable selection of weapons. Again, quite likely you'll find a comfortable choice of the lot. And while it's probably not encouraged, you could get through any situation with one loadout the whole time. But I do recommend at least giving each weapon a try, you never know what you'll end up liking. And of course there are situations each weapon choice will be better for. My personal favourite so far is dual hand-crossbows.The only real things I would like the game to improve in would all be in the realm of adding new features. I can think of lots of things I would like the game to also do, hehe. But having ideas for things to add to a game is easy. And it looks like it doesn't really need my help. I will instead just read the frequent patch notes to see what it does add. It's got a pretty solid base to build from.I should mention that I play it on Oculus Home now, so my steam timer has stopped counting up, hehe."

The archery is on point (much like other quality archery titles), but it also mixes in other weapons as well. While the sword and shield, daggers, axe, and others are a little clunky for now, they definitely put a fantasy feel into this world and help to make the player feel like they are a real adventurer. With a few more developed quests/objectives, this will be the first step in bringing Dungeons and Dragons to VR.Procedurally generated maps are a great idea and help to boost replayability, though I would say that a lot of the similar ""tiles"" or ""sections"" of map are reused too often. This seems to be less and less of an issue as more maps are introduced, but it isn't totally randomized but rather a random piecing together of larger chunks.The developers look like they  have a good idea on the direction to take the game, and are updating with enough content that it really makes the development process feel like its going somewhere (unlike a lot of early access games). New items, levels, and monster classes have been added, and I would expect a lot more before they are finished. Definitely worth the EA purchase to pick it up every couple weeks for a few hours to dig back into the great existant features, and try out all the new ones they've added."

This game is not without it's issues but switching to the experimental branch has helped somewhat (really should be the other way around though). Despite glitchy ai and pathing, odd moments of teleporting off the edge of the world or weapons bugging out completely this is actually a very enjoyable experience. The range combat is generally far more enjoyable and solid than the melee though. At first I would switch to melee weapons whenever the orcs closed but honestly it's easier and more enjoyable to stick with range weapons and just shoot things point blank. Which makes it a bit of a shame that there are a variety of melee weapons to unlock, more variety in bows with different special attacks would be more appropriate for this games strengths.I found myself sticking with the second proper bow to unluck and occasionally messing around with the duel crossbows. Taken purely as an archery game it compares very favourably with the other current vr offerings. Worth the price (which is very reasonable), though I strongly encorage the dev to get the major bugs and ai/pathing glitches fixed in the main branch ASAP."

I've not played for long but fully intend to continue!The archery is almost exactly as I'd want. It may be exactly what I want, but learning to adjust between how archery is done between different games is a big part of VR right now. There were some invisible walls/sections which arrows wouldn't go through on some levels, but otherwise fine.Sword and shield, it works alright. To be honest I don't know enough to know how it could best be improved. The shield does block effectively, but it's way too easy to just waggle your sword in front of you and pick every enemy very fast.Throwing knives, the only thing I think needs real improvement (other than my aim) is the ease at which you can grab them to throw. I found it wasn't worth trying to reach down to my waist for them (even before my poor aim).There's a good selection of enemies. Archers, mages, some with battleaxes, swords/shields, some cast magic shields around other enemies making them invulnerable. The AI could do with a little improvement. They do sometimes get stuck or think they can see you to hit you when they're ever so slightly just around the corner meaning they only hit the wall/pillar.Map generation is very cool. I really hope the developer intends to do some missions in actual dungeons. The dark, claustrophobic environment would be very intense! But some of the darker levels, despite their place on floating islands, do offer a similar experience.There's only a couple of notable issues I've come across so far:1. Weapon selection in the starting area sometimes goes a bit mad. When selecting a newly unlocked bow, it selected it on top of my existing bow. I was holding two bows, neither of which I could fire, and I could no longer move around unless I was holding the weapon select button. I solved by restarting the game and reselecting the new bow.2. The blink effect while teleporting is a bit too extreme for me. The field of view while moving is made way too small, and by not having anything visible in the peripheral, it was just as, if not more disorientating than turning it off. Perhaps look at Google Earth VR. It may not suit Trickster VR perfectly, but having an indication of where the floor is when teleporting, and perhaps being able to adjust the field of view while blinking would make it that bit better.TLDR; buy it."

Its just... beautiful!I can´t find words for it, but I gotta say that the level of environmental detail, the colorful sceneries, the well-made Orcs and creatures just looks lovely and really adds something special to the overall mood in this game, and to the immersion and feeling in VR.Its kind of a cartoonish style of graphics, but at the same time so realistic! You really feel yourself present in this fantasy world, and you kind of get on the right mood after a few seconds. Its impossible to describe in words, this game must be experienced for real in VR to understand my point here!The in-game combat is great, especially with the sword and shield, but the bow works and feels perfect - actually much better than in Longbow in The Lab.Soundtrack and sound effects are amazing, the music soundtrack gives you a Bravehart-feeling, and it fits perfect into this game. The orcs sounds like orcs, and you gotta love the sound of the sword hitting your opponents.And then the locomotion system - YES, it has support for touchpad-walking, so you can walk around freely during exploration and combat. Even when playing the wave-game mode, you still can move freely around - thats something I miss in most other games!The adventure mode is awesome, but the wave-game mode is very entertaining as well.Another thing is that the developers are constantly working to improve and update this game - so you get so much content for free once you buy this. And also, the price, well this game could have costed 20 or 30 bucks and still be worth it. For around 10 bucks this is really a MUST-HAVE game in your VR library. I promise you guys, you wont regret it!...and did I mention the graphics, btw? :)Wow, I can really recommend Trickster VR for you all, as its both a great game and also a beautiful VR experience. Definitely one of the best show-off VR games available as well, that you can show to your friends while introducing them to Virtual Reality.PS: Big thanks to the developers for adding VR Mixed Reality support to this game!Just get it, enjoy it, and you will love it!CheersSweViver"

There is also an option to occlude a portion of the field of view while moving to reduce motion sickness, allowing people who don't ""have their VR legs"" (like me) to use walking motion (instead of teleport, for instance).So far the difficulty has been challenging but rewardingThe procedural dungeons probably mean good replay-ability (I don't have enough playtime yet to vouch for that, but it certainly looks like this is the case)It has classic monsters (Orcish goblins and goblin-ish orcs) and an appealing color palette.This game sure is beautiful and it runs very well on my machineMost early-access games lack content and polish but this one seems to have enough material implemented to justify the price.I wasn't in love with the longbow's aiming, maybe all my hours in QuiVR warped my expectations. I think a few weapon-handling options would go a long way to help this game feel unique yet familiar."

It's one of those games similar to what I imagined VR would be like before the consumer headsets came out. The levels a great, the design is spot on and they nailed the bow combat. There are a few bugs, but it's not a heafty price tag so they can be overlooked to a degree. The biggest thing I'd like to see is a velocity/distance based sword damage mechanic. At the moment the sword combat is it's weakest part, you can kinda just waggle the sword and things will die. Overall though it's a great game for the price and I look forward to seeing it's full realease."
,Recommended,512220,29461046,Posted: 24 January,all,Blargedy,"I originally played this game when it was first put on the steam store. Since then it has undergone massive massive overhaul, which shows the game is in active development. There are some good things about this game, and many bad. However, I have high hopes and will check back some time in the future, as I am sure the issues will be addressed.In my opinion, this game is more of an action game than a dungeon crawler, due to the frequency of enemies and lack or real exploring. This may or may not be your thing, so I suggest trying the game for an hour and refunding if you don't like it.pros:- there is a variety of weapons which all function very differently from one another. It encourages varied combat and allows for more tools to defeat the different types of enemies that have weaknesses to certain types and directions of attack.-there are a lot of options for VR comfort, so it is possible to minimize nausea.-The game runs well on my computer, which  has a GTX 1080. You would think this wouldn't need to be said, but some VR games stutter and lag and frame drop regardless of your hardware.-exploration is encouraged via the changing objectives and waypoints-the art style is consistent and feels like a fantasy world-the music is enjoyable.cons:-the music is out of place contextually. It will be playing super epic music when I am just backtracking and nothing is happening. It makes it feel silly sometimes.-there are too few terrain pieces which the game chooses from. I found myself becoming lost because I couldn't tell whether this identical gate->grassy area->large curved cliff was one of the 4 others exactly like it or a new one.-There are too few poses for the enemies. They will teleport if they run over a ledge or drop down from their airship. They will go from standing in front of you to having hit you with what seems like jerky and unnatural body movements-Enemies will literally go inside you and just cheese you to death. This was a problem in the original release as well. It was the primary reason I didn't have fun in the combat. That being said, the trolls are far less agressive, and will only sometimes go inside you. The AI of the enemy is fairly broken, since they will just charge at you one by one, often with pathfinding glitches, and BS shots that shouldn't be possible.-The collision detection with  weapons and shields seems very inconsistent, with trolls blocking hits they shouldn't, and landing blows they shouldn't.-The combat feels weak and unresponsive. Due to the aforementioned hit detection issues, the combat feels like you are swinging a butter knife in front of you with enemies sometimes dying and sometimes not.-The multi shot crossbow is far too  inconsistent. It feels like it only shoots straight half the time. That being said it is still super fun to shoot with against several orcs/trolls coming at you. Sometimes the reload twists won't register.-The world hub is confusing. I don't know what the color scheme of the boxes is supposed to mean.-Quests lack meaning and feel arbitrary. Mainly due to the fact that the environments feel so similar to one another, the one-quest-per-world makes exploring the world unrewarding. I only did two quests, so this could change in later quests.-The constant epic music and stream of enemies makes there be no contrast. It gets tiring and makes something that should be exciting become boring.-In the two missions I did, there was no variety in game mechanics. The missions functioned identically to one another. Go there, kill stuff, go home.______________________________________________________________________There are some great aspects, like the variety of weapons and the promise of finding new equipment, and then there are some bad aspects, like the terrible sword combat. It has great potential. The idea is great, the direction it is heading is great, but it just isn't there yet.TLDR; This game is mediocre but is heading in the right direction."

You have a bow (good) and [secondary throwing knives (good) and/or a sword (meh not so good)] to start off using. The bow has a powerup feature that will let you shoot multiple arrows every so often (activate with trackpad then shoot). You can hit multiple targets with the triple shot arrow and the 3 throwing knives. Close combat is deadly. The mobs increase in number as you reach each wave and harder mobs come also that have different attacks to damage you. There are some champion type mobs that come that take many hits to kill and if they get close they do lots of damage to you and your portal. Over all a decent wave shooter if you like the bow and knives. The dev will be adding a different mode that has objectives and we will be able to move from island to island. I am waiting for that.

Never ending waves of baddies really hate your portal and want to kill is protective floating rocks. You really like putting arrows in their faces.While I did enjoy the title, I'm not sure the 9.99 price tag is appropriate. The demo video is a little misleading with the sword combat as the 'sword' is more a throwing dagger than a melee weapon.Really the game consists of 4/5 randomly appearing spawn islands floating up to your island and waves of orcs descend on your portal. The action gets fast and really fun but there's not a lot of depth to the game at the moment.My final judgement is that if you're a big fan of these games, go ahead and pick it up, you'll probably enjoy yourself.

It is The Lab Longbow meets Vanshing Realms meets the PC Orcs Must Die.  Fun tower defense with interesting enemy types.I'm really looking forward to seeing how this game expands with more weapons and enemies.At the time of this review, the bow feels pretty good when you go in the options and switch it to the long draw.  It isn't quite as good as The Lab, but better than most any other bow game I've played.  Love building up the power meter to get the triple shot.The daggers and swords need some work or tuning. They are ok, but I rarely use them compared to the default bow.  Maybe the game should have me run out of arrows and have to go to a column to grab another quiver. That might make me grab for the sword more often.I like how the teleport blocks your vision a little. It makes me hesitate in using it except for emergencies (compared to Vanishing Realms where it was so easy that it was more strategic to ""cheat"" by bouncing all around the enmeies)"

Movement breaks, enemy pathfinding breaks, enemy hit detection breaks (especially the lasers), weapon switching breaks, weapon reloading breaks, weapon firing breaks, weapon hit detection breaks, and all require a restart to fix.Completing levels is extremely glitchy. After a series of rapid respawns, the game will either dump you back in the hub world with the level completed, dump you back in the hub world without the level completed, or dump you back in the level with glitchy weapons. All three have happened regardless of whether I've died or completed the level.Melee weapons also need far more oomph. It feels like I'm swinging at air. I have no idea if my swings are doing damage. Adding significantly more enemy knockback would fix this.Also, using the grip for weapon switching causes accidental weapon switching when swinging a weapon.This game does a lot of things right, good graphics, procedural levels, great bow controls, hand based movement instead of head based movement, and properly using the playspace for dodging and cover.

,Recommended,512220,29182183,Posted: 11 January,all,Reach,"This game is amazingly well done. Even in it's early access stages, it's the first VR title I've purchased that feels like a fully fleshed out game instead of just a tech demo or ""a look into what VR is capable of"" and the devs are actively working to improve the game with hotfixes and content updates.The meat of the game is the adventure mode in which you traverse through procedurally generated dungeons to complete objectives while fighting through a horde of angry orcs. There's a good variety to the enemies in the game, each with their own strengths, and as you progress through the campaign you unlock new weapons to kill them with.The other game mode is a wave defense where you protect your portal from an onslaught of orcs and shoot for the high score.Where I think the game excels above other titles though is how it controls. They have several movement options:Teleport - Hold the button, point where you want to go and appear there.Point and Move - Press up on the right hand track pad to move where the controller is pointing.Single Stick - Use the right trackpad to move forward and back based on where you're looking.Dual Stick - Use the left trackpad to move forward/back, strafe left/right and the right trackpad to turn left and right.The dual stick is my personal favorite and feels the most immersive, allowing me to move freely while fighting. I feel more titles should adopt this system as I find the current standard of teleporting in most titles disorienting. The combat controls are also well done. Drawing the bow feels great and wading into orcs with my sword and shield is incredibly satisfying.All that said, while the player controls are tight, the enemy AI could use a little bit of work. I've found on a few occasions that I can confuse the AI into a walking loop by dropping off a short ledge, allowing me to pick them off without much difficulty. Another problem I've encountered is that when walking around some of the more cluttered areas, I will clip on objects and end up getting stuck for a few moments while I navigate my way out of a pillar or a barrel.All in all though I've had a fantastic time playing so far and look forward to what new content the devs are gonna add to the game. I definitely recommend giving it a try."

I've seen enemies floating in the air. Enemies stuck in the ground. And thief orcs completely freezing and not doing anything after throwing their smoke bomb.New weapons are great, But i feel the dual crossbows are abit underpowered. Maybe they're just bad against hunter / bow orcs? using the shotgun-like ability is fun though. I feel this game is going to be a really good VR title, As the developer is very active and frequently updates the game, So while the procedurally generated adventure mode is pretty neat it's still pretty wonky.Sadly the left handed option for the bows are still awkward to use. And i haven't been able to actually use the settings mode to change to right handed as it's unresponsive to my laser. (I'm ambidextrous, But prefer to use my left hand for stuff like bows, and having to hold the bow in an awkward position to aim with anything resembling accuracy isn't comfortable after awhile.)Ultimately this is a pretty good game, Can't wait to see what the future has in store.(also i'd recommened the player take damage if the try to go through / slash the healing orcs shield. As it's pretty weird to be able to switch to sword and board and just roflstomp your way through a bubble shielded orc completely ignoring mr glowy blue shield orcs purpose in life)old review below for fun history purposes. Some points still valid but take with your favorite brand of table salt+Different orcs require different strategies to fight (flank shield orcs, Dodge mage orcs magic etc)+Bow triple shot powerup feels really satisfying to land on 3 powerful orcs+Can swap glowy sword for throwing knives and vice versa mid game+You can teleport through orcs with your sword pointed at them to dash stab the orcs.+Wave shooter where you can teleport anywhere on your floating island+Melee combat+Glowy Sword that you can throw at the enemy+Price-You can't teleport on the orcs floating islands-""Being a showoff"" isn't that badass yet. The game counts your headshots in a row though.-Teleporting can be very disorienting and nausiaiting at first. Took me about 10-15 minutes to get used to it.-Melee combat is just hitboxes right now. Physics or being able to dodge orc melee attacks would be sweet (You can ""dodge"" by teleporting away from the orcs. But not what i mean.)-You can't abandon the bow and wield throwing knives and sword. It's either bow + knives Or bow + swordI like this game a lot, Has a lot of potential. More weapons would be great to keep the game fresh. And maybe some more orcs too.Also, Fun thing i like to do is put the bow controller out of my play area and do a sword only run.

76561198038610388,Recommended,512220,29429733,Posted: 22 January,all,Krut,"First thing's first, I think this game is worth the price point. Anything I say from now to the end of this mini review should be taken with a pinch of salt because none of it is damning, especially for a game which hasn't made it out of Early Access as yet. This game is a lot of fun, has good drum beat music that switches you into battle mode and what sound design there is impresses (I would have liked it if beating the shield madesome kind of sound but hey ho).Orc AI could do with some work. Sometimes the orcs come to fight you, sometimes they just derp and stand stock-still for an easy kill. There have been occasions where an orc ran away from me only to then confront me again and I can't work out if that's him being all fearful like and trying to save his own skin (because he saw how many of his brethren I had slaughtered) or if it was AI not knowing what it should do. Orcs do get stuck in geometry and in falling states if they come in via balloon and happen to drop down onto the wrong spot. This one time I watched in awe as an orc landed on a bridge only to charge forward (and down) into the void below, so it's safe to say their pathfinding ability is like their IQs, on the low side.Every now and then I'll teleport too close to orcs then I'll find that I can't hit them, which is fair enough.I imagine that by playing in walk mode you can avoid getting too close to orcs altogether. I've had situations where I teleported a short distance away from orcs and all the ones I could see a moment ago had apparently despawned (and none of them had been killed).Teleporting behind myself and wherever else I could escape to has gotten me out of harm's way many times but I think there have been just as many times where I was hit in the crossfireand took unavoidable damage. What I'll have to try and do is teleport more intelligently byducking before teleporting or otherwise taking cover behind rocks and trees and architecturewhile also laying down covering fire.When it comes down to it though, this is also a numbers game.If there are too many orcs in an area, they will probably overwhelm you because 5 archersfiring on you in an area just teleported to is something only Neo could counter.I might git gud but at the moment it's fun to kill in inventive ways.Blind use of the ballista immediately springs to mind as one of the more satisfying waysyou can slay an orc in Trickster although the only limit on how fast you can kill orcsis the speed you nock an arrow at and the haste with whichyou throw knives from your waist.The weaponry is a good selection that makes it so that you're never totally between a rock and a hard place. If all else fails, then a quick flick of the throwing knives at your belt will usually mess them up. I'm still getting used to the first badass weapon pair that you unlock. Nailing the berserker orcs with a ranged weapon special attack is always a highlight.Enemy ragdolling is pretty funny when it happens and the enemy variety is about what I would expect for the levels I've gone through (only the first few btw). You can see an orc in one of the trailers have his head shot through a pillar, which isn't a bad thing per se but it could detract from your immersion, I don't know. I've scored headshots I shouldn't have been able to in this way. When my Dad played, he accidentally kept switching weapons and made it look as though he beat an orc to death with a bow+arrow rather than sword+board which was kinda funny.That's my two penn'orth and I actually put my money where my mouth is so hopefully you come to some sort of conclusion what to do with your dinero based on what I said here or a video review or something and decide to help these devs out with your hardearned cash."
,Recommended,512220,29286235,Posted: 15 January,all,Hauke,I just picked this game up and had no idea how fun this was going to be.First Impressions:- The combat is quite fun. Shooting the bow takes some slight practice but is pretty fun. The sword and shield is nice and it feels good to slice and orc up. I was able to get the dual crossbow weapons and they are quite fun to kill the orcs with.- The VR immersion is actually pretty great you do feel like you're standing on a floating island- The game runs remarkebly well on my AMD system

First freemove I've tried and initially felt a little queasy but got used to it quickly and now I love it :)  Great to see a dev offering both options too.  I love a good hack n slash RPG and VR was made for this, good variation of weapons too.Could do with some improvement in the AI behaviour and the hit of the weapons could be a bit more accurate but minor issues that don't really detract from what is a fun game........plus its a tenner, bargain :)"

76561198081075225,Recommended,512220,30866944,Posted: 31 March,all,KRON,"Solid game, only just started playing it but I like what they've done so far.  I can see how the gameplay might get a bit repetative, but it's still fun and I expect the devs plan to build on what's there, hopefully adding additional levels, enemies, quest types and mechanics.   If they can 'flesh it out' in those regards a bit more, I expect it will be a top seller.  As-is, it's probably well worth the price and a fun game to take turns playing with friends since levels are reasonably short.The only major critique I have is for some reason is seems that when you turn your head in certain areas, the environment goes a bit dark.  Not sure if this is a bug or feature that's supposed to be tellling me something, but it seems like a bug.  Like somehow looking at a shadowed area turns down global illumination."

,Recommended,512220,26299417,"Posted: 29 October, 2016",all,Rinski,"--------------------------UPDATE1 (08 feb 2017 - change recommendation to ""Yes""):--------------------------Ok... Game now costs its money and it is good for one who like dungeon crawler type of games. It is brainless slasher and that's all. But it's still boring and misses something important for me, but I can not say what... >.<1. COMBAT SYSTEMNow Combat system is responsive and has some haptic feedback. And it is good!You can parry arrows with a sword, but I couldn't block another sword hit from orc with my sword. I tried several times, but could not. Was it a bad luck or just feature of the game - I don't know.Combat system is still have an issue for a good combat feeling. I will describe it in the next paragraph.2. AIOk, AI is still stupid as hell. They run towards you, when they in the distance to hit you, they will try to do so. They do not try to run around you to shoot you in the back, they do not move in front of you to land a flank hit. No! Just run towards you, stack in front of you, try to kill you, ???, PROFIT!The MAIN PROBLEM in AI and combat system is that when the orc is too close to you, you can not block its hits. You have to move a little bit backward and then you can block some hits again, but orc will come close in some time and you can not block again...The second problem is that AI can spawn behind your back where you were before, right in front of you in the air. And so on... Not a good thing. It's stange that you moved 10 meters from the spawn portal, kill all orcs in front of you, move 5 more meters and some orcs are already running from behind from spawn portal direction.3. GENERATED LEVELSNow I don't get any collisions. But levels are all the same. They are different because they were generated but in the same time they are all the same because they are generated from the small amount of templates.4. DEVELOPERSThat's the main reason why I recommend this game. I appreciate the fact that developers of this game try to do their best, they communicate with the comunity to make the game better, they support and keep updating their game. That's wonderful! Respect, TricksterDevs!--------------------------REVIEW (nov 2016):--------------------------Well, this game is impossible to play if you have played Vanishing Realms before.- Poor combat system. I couldn't understand when I landed an attack and when not, when I was hit and was not...- Stupid AI. They just run towards you and attack you with one template. That's all.- Buggy level generation system. I had to go through a wall to cointinue progress on level.And so on...P.S. English isn't my native language. Sry for mistakes."

,Recommended,512220,31345936,Posted: 24 April,all,Mutton (Ryan),"I love this game. Firstly it does locomotion right, I have a small play area so this allows me to walk around without teleporting or making me feel motion sick. (I use twin stick for this game)The combat is pretty fun, would be nice if there was more impact with the weapons as they dont feel real, like they float through each other. Enemies also feel big to fight and the random levels feel fun to explore.I really enjoyed this game and is definatly worth the money"

76561198048876713,Recommended,512220,30738045,Posted: 25 March,all,Jac Richardson,"I still don't recommend this game, but it has gotten allot better. They fixed my major complaints with movement. I didn't get stuck on geometry or teleport weirdly this time. Movement relative to facing direction is a huge improvement. There is now a teleportation icon, though it is a little awkward to do a stick click to use it. Now I can move around comfortably.As for gameplay, still a little shallow, but if you were just looking for an archery simulator with a little bit of movement, this is great. Though honestly, given how simple it is, a 12 dollar price tag is a little high. The approach of this game is more on the side is allot of playable content instead of a little exceptional content.Now the gameplay is still a little shallow, especially the sword play, but fixing that would be extremely difficult, as in the only obvious way to do it requires better hardware. As in, an omni directonal treadmill, a real sword and walls for resistance.For reference, the original review below.Its poor navigation mechanics stifle what might otherwise be an enjoyable game.First, I like that you tried to use the vignette feature, but you don't seem to understand why you use the vignette feature. Yes, for one it is to get rid of your peripheral vision, but that is not the MAIN point. the main point is to prevent you from seeing things moving past too quickly. Look at eagle flight. That always darkens when your turning, which is good since turning is uncomfortable. But it also darkens when you're next to something. So if some one walks sideways, you should actually shift the part you can see toward the direction your moving. That is, you should darken forward too.Also, maybe provide some smoother vignettes, so they are less noticable. In fact, if you could make it adapt to how close the scene is, that would be even better.Next, you don't seem to understand why we use teleport mechanics. The teleport should be a teleport, not a quick acceleration forward, then a quick acceleration to a stop. Thats actually more uncomfortable then smooth movement. Look at how robo-recall and farlands handle teleportation. That is how it should feel. Also, teleporting based on which direction our hands are facing is disorienting without an icon to indicate where we will teleport.Twin stick movement, where to begin. First, its buggy. With oculus touch, try walking forward then touching your face. If its like my experience, you will suddenly rush backward. Similarly, if you pount your right hand at your left while walking you rush back and left. This movement is fast enough it warps me under stairs. Not being able to walk while your shield is up seems weird as well.I don't know how that code is working, but it should be independant of hand motion. Walking should depend only on gaze direction, so this bug is baffling to me.Your twin stick movement also has a tendency to get stuck on rocks, so I have to physically walk to keep moving. If I never turn, this happens less, but obviously I want to turn. Your walking also is not as smooth as I would like. I would advise trying out windlands. Windlands has a fantastic walking mechanics. Take a lesson from them.Look, I like your premise, but the game is really hard to play without a comfortable movement mechanic."

Pretty good for early access.The short grip press is practically useless - it is far too likely to result in a weapon switch, and the long press and rotate takes too long. How about ran option for right controller grip press changes to melee, and left controller changes to missile?"
