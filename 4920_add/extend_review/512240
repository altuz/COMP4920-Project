76561198052665462,Recommended,512240,25075926,"Posted: 22 August, 2016",all,VReviews - KingPeuche,"Well that game was a pleasant surprise.This game is reminiscent of old style arcade games, however brought into VR. You have a time limit to shoot as many ducks or objects as you can, and in doing so you get points. The area is full of explosives and other little things that pop up, and it really does add up to make the map feel content-full; this also allows for every run to have a slightly different feeling. You also learn or see something new each time, and this is a fantastic thing to say about an Arcade shooter such as this one. Don't expect this game to reward sharp shooting, though, as there will be so many ducks flying around that the best option really is to just shoot like a maniac. One match of Duckpocalypse is 3 minutes long, if I remember correctly from playing, and that's the perfect amount of time for the game to progress in the pace it intends to. The gameplay itself also feels natural - you will certainly familiarize with the guns within the first 20 seconds of playtime as there is no reload time on them, nor do the gun shots curve due to any form of air phsyics, so it really is just pick up and play.This game has a thematic feel of a spiritual successor to Duck Hunt, and if that wasn't already completely obvious from the trailer alone, entering the game will demonstrate this in a much more powerful way, and will definitely make your inner-self scream ""Holy Crow, I'm INSIDE Duck Hunt!!"". I must absolutely commend the theme of this game, as everything somehow blends together perfectly; I just can't understand how an arcade/post-appocalyptic/Duck-Hunt mash-up makes this much sense. The game confidently knows exactly how it wants to look, and the player will appreciate this, as it really does feel refined and intelligently put together. So huge mega thumbs up on the thematic attention, Devs.There are two things that I must say are a little bit of a let down. The first of which is the replay value. After the first few rounds, it doesn't really feel like there's much of a reason to continue playing. Perhaps some extra environments would go a long way, or even some new modes or weapon unlocks or the like. In that regard, this game is an absolutely beautiful example of quality over quantity. I mean, I have nine minutes of frigging play-time as of this review, and check out all the things I have to say.The second teeny let down, which didn't really phase me much, is that the physics is advertized even though it holds no value in the game. Sure you can shoot some things in the main room and they'll react in a physics-respecting way, but there are many objects in the lobby that have no physics and simply have the same repeating animation no matter where you shoot them from. What's more, your guns don't physically interact with the things you touch them with, they just phase through. And this wouldn't be an issue; you won't mind this little flaw in the slightest, but the Store Page advertises this, and some may see it as a misleading claim.If you read this review and this game still interests you, then good news, you SHOULD hit that purchase button. Thanks for reading, and have fun killing ducks out there!"

,Recommended,512240,32502535,Posted: 17 June,all,Baphomet,Duckpocalypse is a short and sweet room-scale VR love letter to duck hunt and plays roughly like you would imagine a VR version would (except with goofy post-apocalyptic aesthetic).Not much else to say except that it's cheap and good for a laugh.

Nevr done a review before but was compelled to as it gave me a real blast from the past being some years over 40! I would agree with pretty  much everything previous reviewer has expressed but would just like to add that for £1.99, its a lotta fun even if short lived. 10P a go for duck hunt at the old arcade (long gone now  :( ) in my city back in the day..... Now in proper VR!! awesome!!!"

,Recommended,512240,25076555,"Posted: 22 August, 2016",all,BloodyLombax,"One of the better recent VR games Ive played. Visuals work surprisingly well in VR. Think Minecraft but without the blury ghosting effect and better aliasing. Controls and gameplay are responsive and easy, but game still requires skill. Where you aim is where you hit, which is what you should expect, but its something to be said because many Vive shooters cant seem to get this down. Its also very cheap for just $3, at the very least try it if you like VR shooters.FYI. Im running 1.5 render target multiplier on GTX 980, and game runs fine with no lag or hitching."

The pixel graphics make it unique and fun and the robotic ducks are amazing. The explosions are pleasing to watch and the sounds are great. I would definitely reccomend this game, it's a great VR experience to show to your friends & family and very fun."

Absolutly not!It's one map, one type of gun, one type of gamemode and one goal: Kill as many ducks as you can within a timelimit. What it does offer though is sharp 8-bit graphics, lots of cool explosions, tons of wild shooting, a lot of fun and did I mension an insane amount of ducks?If you have a couple of dollars, buy it. If you don't, then get some. I only wish there was more gamemodes, levels and more weapons, but for the price you really can't expect it."

,Recommended,512240,25196966,"Posted: 27 August, 2016",all,Sonia the Squishy,"The game definitely came as advertised: guns, ducks, explosions. Packing around an hour of content in the current build of the game (which the developer indicated in the discussions is subject to change, as new content may be added), the price is very fitting. A love letter to Duck Hunt (duh), and arcade shooters as a whole, Duckpocalypse is a pretty easy reccomendation for Vive owners, for a few bucks you get a fun, memorable arcade shooter with a great sense of humor. Be warned though that, at least in the current build, the game may get rather repetitive if you aren't hunting down those achievements!"

Usually when I start of SteamVR, before I settle into a longer experiece I'll shoot through a round of Duckocalype.  Also a great game to demo friends when you wanna show of the Vive.  Easy to figure out, fast paced, and a lot of fun... and for 3 bucks, less than the cost of a beer (which makes the game even more fun)."

The game is great and it supports oculus rift, even if it's not stated. I would really love to have a full oculus touch support though, as  it is now being used by the game as if it was a vive controller, and the touch action on the trigger shoots  altogether with the trigger pression, making it feel a little bit weird on the control side. great purchase! please devs, make it fully touch compatible ♥"

I only played for about 20 minutes before my weekling forearms were ready for a break, but damn that was a stupid amount of fun. This game is extremely simple, but has a lot of enjoyment in it. For $3, you can't go wrong. If you ever enjoyed playing Duck Hunt, this is guaranteed to put a smile on your face. Each round is a minute and a half long, a blaster in each hand, and countless birds to kill. I have experienced a lot of fun things in VR, and this is definitely in the top 3 in terms of fun. It will definitely be one of my go to games for introducing people to the vive. Having played it, I'd have paid $5-10 and still been happy, but at $3, I expect this to take off once enough people see it.Tip: Shoot the roof... do it."

,Recommended,512240,34536215,Posted: 27 August,all,-DOOMER-,"This is the NES game Duck Hunt, but on steriods.  I love this game and feel like I have way more time spent in it than Steam is showing.  I brings me back to my childhood and for a few dollars I think everyone would have a fun time with this shooting gallary.   There is no progression, its just a race to see how many points you can get in the aloted time, but its fun and something I play often in VR land."
