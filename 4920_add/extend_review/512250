,Recommended,512250,29421919,Posted: 22 January,all,A Tomato,"Your country is not a part of Europe!Oh... Sir!! is a turn based casual strategy game, where two combatants take turns to string together sentences using words and phrases, with the intent of breaking the other's morale before theirs is.Pretty original art style, at least for me. Goofy character proportions and animations make them look a little bit funnier.The soundtrack is very British and gentleman-y, I suppose. Dialogue is spoken in a Mad Libs manner, where pre-recorded voice lines are strung together. This causes some slightly odd pauses and inflection inconsistencies, but it doesn't detract from its charm.In gameplay, you and your enemy have a common board with words to choose from, as well as separate cards that can be refreshed once per round by drinking tea. Every character has weaknesses: Sir Shufflebottom dislikes getting made fun of his sense of style, such as his hat and suit, while Nigel hates remarks about his body size and shape. Additionally, repeatedly targeting a subject, like ur mum, grants bonus damage against the enemy. It becomes a tactical game where preventing your enemy from exploiting weaknesses or repeated subjects becomes more important than stringing a whopper insult, especially since choosing to continue your insult into the next round carries the risk of wasting it if the opponent's insult is strong enough.You also need to abide by common grammar rules, lest your insult has no effect. For gameplay purposes, commas don't exist outside of sentence terminations like ""and that's a fact!""However, the insults more often than not struggle to make sense, even if gramatically they're correct. ""You fart in your general direction, sir!"" is a valid insult and actually knocks off respectable points. The humor derrives, instead, from how nonsensical the insults can get while simultaneously proving to be effective. Finishing off an enemy with ""your mom is fat"" is a classic.You start off with 3 characters and 3 scenarios to choose from, and as you play through the single insults, tournaments and online matches, you can unlock more of them. It's a good way to extend the playtime of this otherwise small game.If it were any more expensive, I'd be more reluctant to recommend this title, but for just $2, it's worth it. Get a friend to buy it as well, for more laughs."

We just can’t hold ourselves back from insulting people. Oh… Sir! harnesses that and concentrates it on hurting random people’s feelings in a brilliant little $2 game.Worth every penny.It’s a wonderful feeling, winning an argument that is so feeble-minded that a three-year-old could outwit both competitors at the same time in. There’s nothing quite like telling people ‘your mother doesn’t like your cousin’s car and was born in your favourite Bond actor and smells like homeless man’s socks’, and you can do exactly that in this funny insult trading simulator.In the game, you must concoct the master insult in turn-based phrase-picking. You choose one word or phrase, then your opponent chooses one, then you choose another, then your opponent chooses another, etc. This goes on until you’ve used enough turns to tell the other player that their father works with the Hell’s Grannies Gang and dances like a parrot, and they blurt out that your hovercraft has worse hair than your house. After a few exchanged insults, you find out that you might not really be worth this first class train seat that you’ve been bickering about after all.If you use the same subject two insults in a row, you get a ‘combo’ which deals a bunch more damage to your foe’s pride. In the end, you want to make them lose all their pride and give up because you’re too tough to let words hurt you.Each character that you can choose from before entering a verbal abuse-fest has their own weakness, such as the old lady getting most offended when you speak about age or death, and the stylish gentleman becoming upset over you insulting his style. They also have their own phrases, such as the Russian character muttering in Russian and Morgan Freeman going on about ‘puny mortals’.You can practice against the CPU to test and hone your insult-dealing skills, try to offend a random person online, or compete against your friends on same system over the Internet.For $2 it’s a bargain and I’m having a blast annoying people in it."
76561198104660227,Recommended,512250,28194014,"Posted: 4 December, 2016",all,Mariya,"In a medium saturated with guns and fists, Oh...Sir!! provides a refreshing take on nonviolent combat that is well worth the asking price.  The game takes the skeleton of a typical fighting game and replaces precision reflex button presses with turn-based sentence construction.  It then surrounds this mechanic with lovely pixel art and all the absurdist humor and briticisms of Monty Python.  In fact, the direct references are so prolific that at times the game reads like an experimental sketch from the early years of the show.  And while the intentional silliness is a selling point, it does represent a missed opportunity for linguistic depth.Oh...Sir!!’s core gameplay finds you constructing insulting sentences by linking object phrases, like “your mother”, with descriptive phrases, like “is getting fat”, and stringing those together with conjunctions, primarily “and”.  Both players alternate picking one sentence fragment at a time from a shared pool to make the best insult they can before the pool runs out and the round ends at which point they speak their respective sentences aloud and deal damage according to the sentence quality.  Further depth of play comes from incomplete descriptive phrases, like “farted on”, that require a second object for completion, and a two-phrase pool that each player has that only they can access.  But it’s the fairly nebulous concept of a sentence’s “quality” that causes confusion.Imagine my confusion when a more logically coherent and subtly offensive sentence would give paltry damage, while a completely incoherent and irrelevant statement from the computer would win him the match.  Surely implying that my adversary’s spouse was having an incestual affair is more insulting than saying their “sense of style changes into a hovercraft”, right?  Further obfuscating the issue, I received a grammar penalty for a complex, but technically grammatically correct sentence.  It wasn't until I saw a hint on a loading screen essentially saying ""funnier insults do more damage"" that the nonsensical phrase options like ""hovercraft"" clicked into place: weirdness is a major factor contributing to the “quality” of an insult.  In this way, the subtitle of ""Insult Simulator"" is meant to be taken with the same irony one would expect from ""walking simulator"" or ""Goat Simulator"".  You see, while there are some systems to account for the freedom and magnitude of language (i.e. changing new phrases to match the tense and plurality of the existing sentence), the game almost never accounts for rhetoric or the full extent of english syntax.  Scoring is based on sentence length and very broad situation and character specific cues.  Combos for extra damage are strung together by including a phrase in multiple consecutive insults.  Oh...Sir!! isn’t trying to accurately simulate the refined craft of arguing exclusively with ad hominem, it’s trying to make a video game with arbitrary video game systems.  In other words, Oh..Sir!! rewards an understanding of its own invented mechanics while punishing an understanding of the underlying mechanics and creative usage of language.This is not to say that this focus on the wackiness of randomly generated insults is a bad thing.  In fact, in many ways it is a good decision.  For example, the more universal humor of a nonsense statement broadens the appeal of the game as increased linguistic depth might’ve made the game unreasonably difficult for people who lack an affinity for writing or rhetoric.  And the endearing aesthetic of the stiff and off kilter british caricatures definitely fits with their absurd, fractured remarks.  It just means that the game sacrifices certain interesting design possibilities.  Like, what if instead of each character having a full hypothetical set of siblings, spouses, children, and parents, they each had a unique, personal family history (perhaps akin to the generational system in Rogue Legacy) and maybe an insult about a person’s gay uncle could strike a nerve with them?  Now that could really sell the fantasy of being just a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a silver tongue.In any case, Oh..Sir!!: the Insult Simulator is well worth the $2."

,Recommended,512250,29837202,Posted: 10 February,all,[ARX]AnthonyPS,"Oh...Sir!! The Insult Simulator is a turn-based, comedy indie-game made by Vile Monarch. The gameplay is really simple: You have to form a grammatically correct sentence of insult using the randomly generated phrases/clause in order to mentally obliterate your opponent. It may sounds boring if I describe it, but those randomly generated phrases/clause are hilarious. If you're a YouTube dweller, you must have heard about this game before since it kind of boomed for a while back in its early release. Since the game itself does not have that many content to review, I'll just give you a short pros and cons:Pros:+ Definitely a fun local co-op (plays at the same PC) game to play in a party+ I have to give the devs credits for the creative idea. This is a fresh, innovative, and well-executed game idea.+ You will generate the most outrageous insult sentence that you have never thought of. My point is, this game has a great comedy aspect+ Enriches your vocabulary, you can insult people like a thesaurus+ Great balance between entertaining and challengingCons:- Limited map and characters. It will get dull and repetitive after several hours.- I do not know how difficult it is, and I have no experience in game developing, but the devs are a bit slow in adding new content to broaden the gameplay variation. They can lose momentum quickly if they failed to keep the player base engaged.- Almost no replayability value. People who have watched the YouTube gameplay already knows all the funny jokes and lose interest in the game quickly.In conclusion, this is game will be best in giving you the local co-op experience with people you know. There is really no point in going online and play with strangers or play with an AI IMO. Nevertheless, the price is really cheap, and it is right for the value. Challenge your friends for several rounds of this game if they don't know about this game yet and it'll be a blast.Thank you for reading!"

I think the concept is great but it is poorly constucted. There are so many repeats of the same phrases over and over. The majority of which aren't all that funny. Some just don't make sense. I guess I was hoping for a Cards Against Humanity humour type of experience. Sure, some lines are amusing but not so much when they get repeated over and over. This ultimately makes the game old fast. I guess I also was expecting a bit more variety. I hate that they used Monty Python lines in an attempt to make the game funnier. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge MP fan and that just make me want to ditch the game and go and watch some actual Monty Python. I honestly think I'd have more fun in a chat room coming up with my own inane/clever insults. I think the price was fair since you basically get a game that is engaging for about 5 minutes. The only thing that would turn this game around for me is if players could input their own ridiculous phrases or words. Like having 90 seconds to put in a couple of nouns, adjectives, etc...I also had an issue with the online play mode due to disconnection.

The Insult Simulator, a casual little fill-in-the-blank style game that will test your razor sharp wit as well as your friendships.InOh… Sir!, you face off against a computer or human opponent and try  to build the best insult. The goal of the game is to create an insult that not only shatters one’s pride, but also makes sense.  You’ll take turns with your opponent until you’re satisfied with your insult or until the word bank runs out of useful phrases.To do so, both parties select words and phrases from a shared word bank, presented as a variety of surfaces off of which two verbal joists can have afternoon tea.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=792109124And speaking of tea, the icon that looks like a teacup allows you to ""sip tea"" (which is a funny double entendre given the slang meaning), and refresh the two additional words/phrases found in the bottom left corner. You can do this once per turn, though you can use any of the four possible phrases.If you still aren’t satisfied with your zinger, click the button that looks like an ellipsis (…) This functions as a stall button and allows you to wait it out until the next turn, during which you can finish the insult you started. If you’ve completed the perfect insult early, the button that looks like a hand with a wrist watch (positioned right above the teacup; no true gentleman can be without either) will  serve as a way to speed things up by ending your turn and allowing your opponent to string words together at their leisure.*You don't do damage the turn you skipped, but hopefully you'll build a better insult as a resultHit them where it hurts.Once you submit your insult, either party reads off their insults in a voice that is only slightly less robotic than Windows 10’s Cortana. Then, the computer crunches some numbers and the prides of both yourself and your opponent receive damage. The first person to hit 0 pride loses.If your insult doesn’t make sense, it doesn’t do damage, so you are constrained by certain grammatical rules (like you can’t choose a phrase ending in an exclamation point as the beginning of your insult). Alternatively, you can do extra damage if you insult your opponent’s weak point—maybe he’s sensitive about his mother or maybe he’s proud of his personal flare?—and combo insults together by using the same subject matter—like dancing or fruit—more than one insult in a row.There are a total of 7 characters to play as in the “Instant Argument” campaign mode with 3 unlocked right off the bat. You unlock more characters by proving your insult prowess. There are also 5 fine locations where you can sling your insults, of which 4 are immediately available.The locations add a bit of charm to the playing field as you’ll find different backgrounds, themes for your playing field (the gentlemanly table in the tutorial stage becomes a rotting corpse by the lake), and a bit of context banter between characters when your face-off begins.It’s good to have options.Do you like online play? Great!After practicing against A.I. opponents, you can play casually against other meat bags or enter tournament matches, which add score to the leaderboards.Will you be the most offensive gentleperson?Bottom line.The game is loads of fun with or without friends and it’s cheap to boot. If you’re at all curious about the silly antics found within, you should definitely purchase the game. It’s worth at least a few hours of unlocking all of the characters in single player even if you don’t have people to play with."

Of course there are mechanics in this game that determine the way you play sort of like a card game (taking first turn therefore getting first pick on phrases, preventing the opponent from taking a word/phrase so that they can't finish their sentence or get a combo off, etc.)I would say the only negative with the game is the calculation of points. You can build random insults that don't make sense and still get a good amount of score as long as your sentence is grammatically correct (e.g ""Your father is you"").All in all, It's a simple 2$ time-filler that provides some fun with stupid insults."

The Insult Simulatorwas mildly fun for the first hour, but then quickly began to show its paper thin content and scoring system.I played through two tournaments (5 rounds each), and I believe I unlocked all playable characters. The only even remotely interesting character isLo Wang, and he even gets some custom insults. Nice touch. There is online multiplayer, but apparently nobody was ever on when I was trying to play that mode.Essentially, you and your opponent alternate choosing sentence fragments from a common pool to try to piece together decent insults.You each have a very small pool of your own personal arguments, and can refresh this once per round.While you get serious extra points for topical/setting based content and repeating themes, otherwise the scoring seems largely based off of number of sentence structure pieces used.The whole thing is interesting in a mobile game kind of way. I'll give it props that I've never really played anything like this short of theMonkey Islandminigame. The reason I am giving it a negative review is because I feel there was potential squandered, here. The combo system is a great start, but piddles out pretty quickly. Once again, it's paper thin and just too simple. Sometimes you will lose a round because the computer thought you were using poor grammar, and it just shows that not all combinations were really combed through by the play testers/devs. It's fine, but I also have to note that it is there. You quickly learn what the computer will let you do, and what it won't.Pros:+Cheap, interesting and fairly novel game+Nice artwork, and fairly good execution for entertainment that lasts about an hourCons:-No controller support; you must share a mouse for local play, which is kinda stupid - not all of us sit around a computer monitor to play-Scoring system and grammar analysis is too simple; I could go into much more depth here, but I'll leave it at that-The level themes are literally the same story every time; how hard would it have been to come up with a few other scenarios? As far as I know, I saw it all after 2 tournaments (which were exactly the same btw)-After two hours (or probably less), I can solidly say I have easily seen all of the non-character based insults-Hahahahaha yeah its funny wow its crazy and 60 minutes later I'm boredIt's only a buck, so you can't go too wrong here - but you need to know that there is not enough content here to even last you a solid weekend.Peace,"

The Insult Simulator"" is intruiging at first glance, it quickly falls quite short.(This being my very first review on Steam, expect it to be somewhat unorganized.)By putting together dialogue fragments, and constructing the most vile and absurd of insults, you progress towards defeating your opponent. You will be using their soft spots against them, hoping for the right words and sentences to show up in your favor. Perhaps they deal with family issues, or perhaps, their Achille's heel is their choice of style. By taking these factors into account, you come up with strategies, forcing you, the player, to think creatively. right?While I do think the concept in itself is very interesting, the game lacks depth, for multiple reasons.Firstly, picking up strategies along the way does not turn out to be all that engaging- as the options the player is provided with, are rather limited- both in numbers, but also in terms of function. You quickly figure out, that each sentence/word fits under a certain category. Including that sentence/word in any given sentence, you will earn a bonus, as long as the enemy character, considers that very subject offensive, not considering the context (except for the level of absurdity, which I'll explain futher down). Furthermore, as the number of possible words/sentences is very limited, it gets repetetive, and ultimately rather boring piecing together your insults. This is also creates a sense of inconsistency, as the damage dealt to your opponent's pride meter (?) seems arbitrary. The game does reward you for constructing longer sentences, yet it punishes you, for creating insults that are ""too"" absurd. While this is great in theory, the criteria for creating an insult the game considers ""too absurd"", are very vague.Secondly, the number of playable characters is limited. Attacking those parts of your opponents that are vulnerable, ends up becoming dice roll, rather than analyzing their background story (provided in the selection menu). This breaks their personalities and charms apart, as they end up feeling quite alike. I had hoped, that these characters would have something more to offer, not only in terms of the very few special sentences they each occationally are provided with during ""combat"", but also a few more alternative character-defining traits, whether it be passives, special abilites or something radically different. I know I'm being very vague, but the purpose of having different characters in the game, is almost entirely pointless.While the game suffers a bit in terms of the mechanical aspects, I certainly find the aesthetic much fitting. Decent pixel art, as well as some decent voice acting. While the voice acting could have been stepped up by a smidgeon, I wouldn't by any means call it lacking. It is crucial to have solid voice acting for a game about settling arguments through verbal abuse, and I think the game performs as it should in this aspect.Even though I do have a lot of critizism in relation to the game's contents, I still find it very charming, and there's one particular reason, I'm going to keep myself updated to the game. Considering the price tag, I find it perfectly reasonable, for having spent at the very least 1.5hours of fun. The points I've made on the game, are things, I certainly consider possible to fix.I think it's perfectly reasonable to criticize me, on behalf of my high hopes. I was perhaps anticipating a more ambitious project when initially booting up the game (Yes I know, it's 2 euros...).Anyway. Those are just my thoughts."

My suggestion to the developer is to not make it so hard to find some of the phrases and words like in the instance of  the ""Your Wife is interested in photography ' Nudge Nudge' "" phrase like I mean comon ive been trying for days to get the achievement for it but because the words are so random and the words that make the phrase up are so hard to come by that is no easy task to accomplish. Like seriously I've only had (Your wife is interested in photography but no 'Nudge Nudge'  twice in my whole 40 hours of playing the game seriously something has to be done about that.I understand a level of difficulty but this just seems to take rediculous Dumb luck and that isn't really what an ""Achievement"" is supposed to be.Keyword is Achieve meaning you work for it . But that doesnt mean Aquiring it through straight up dumb luck which this game seems to be all about.I just think its rediculous to have to spend 40 plus hours on a game which is all about putting words together and making insulting phrases just  to get all the achievements and for someone like me who tries his best to complete his games to 100% when I can this can be quite annoying.Overall its a great game for the most part but still needs a little work when it comes to the randomness of the words generator besides that little issue this game is quite fun to play and well worth the price"

You will be presented with a mashup of subjects, verbs, and objects, that you'll need to try to craft into the most incindiary, mic-dropping insults (all the while both exploiting your opponents' weaknesses, and protecting your own) you can create, in order to win a ridiculous arguement.(Screenshots here.)You can choose to insult a stranger online, a friend or relative on the couch (+++ for the inclusion of local multiplayer), or just try to withstand an incresingly difficult tournament against your CPU.As you play through the game, you'll develop your own personal playstyle and strategies, and unlock new characters and locations in which to verbally slug it out.The one negative I have is that the grammer rules can be open to interperitation at times, and tend to follow ""British English"" over ""American English"" grammer rules. I guess this should be expected, as the developer is European.Overall, I would highly reccomend this game. It can be as silly and casual, or serious and competitive as you want it to be, and is simple enough that even people who have never played a video game before in their life could easily pick it up and be competitive after a couple rounds."

Not quite like the original quote, but makes for a nice insult.Oh...Sir!! is that nice homage to watching public broadcasting when we were a lot more innocent and thought British humor was smart when in truth it was incredibly cheeky and rude. Ah, it taught me some nice insult skills. Those skills do come in handy in this game.It's a fairly simple game. Build a sentence to insult your opponent. The more absurd of an insult, the better your points. Well...not entirely true. See, your insult has to make a tiny bit of sense. If you're thinking as you string together insults, chances are you'll place higher. Longer insults get better scores but those that seem to be more coherent also do better. To help you get even higher scores, you can earn combos by lingering on the same subject like insulting someone's mother, hamsters, or their hovercraft. There are also weaknesses to exploit.Whittle down someone's pride and carry on. Stiff upper lip, eh?The conquest against the computer isn't the entire draw... You can play online against friends. Given just how cheap this game is, this provides for a lot of unpredictable fun. Think Cards Against Humanity only much less swearing with super proper British people trying to not be very cruel but show how cross they are with a good ol' insult-off.If multiplayer isn't your thing, you can spend time unlocking characters and scenarios to insult at. It doesn't take long to unlock new characters, but you might become so wrapped up in insulting and arguing that you'll lose track of time.Everything is voice acted so when your character is introduced to a new situation, you can hear them use the standard script (except for one moment but I'll refrain from being so picky). It's nice to have that detail. If I want to rush through and not listen to anyone, I can just keep clicking like a crazy person. No need to mute anything unless I desperately need no noise.Your pixelated characters are comical and exaggerated. The art style is fitting and I particularly love Mrs. Maggie. She reminds me of Terry Jones. The voice just screams Terry Jones to me and this made me feel a little warm and fuzzy to get that feeling. Other characters clearly draw inspiration from other popular media, but Mrs. Maggie particular spoke to me because of that. Sure it's not something cutting edge, but this is a humor game and a very cheap one at that. I admire the designs for the nostalgia they give me and I appreciate what they accomplish. If I had one critique, it would be that the other scenarios were nearly as obvious as the pet shop. Sure, everyone knows that sketch and I know the tutorial levels because of the things hidden in it. But I feel like I wanted a little more out of the other ones. No really, hit me over the head with some of the homages to British comedy because while I'm a fan, I'm incredibly stupid sometimes.I've seen some people criticize the voice acting and...I'm not sure if they understand what this game is about. The voices are incredibly spot on for what British comedy is and the final stage is a wonderful nod to pop culture of today. It's great. For the attention to detail on the British comedy that most of us grew up with (because face it, I was poor and PBS showed some awesome stuff after 8pm that wasn't opera) as well as other references we go WINK WINK NUDGE NUDGE over.A pretty solid game to waste time with and invite friends to do so with. However...this is going to be lost on certain gamers. If you're not willing to understand some British comedy and insist the entire world bend to American style comedy, then don't bother. The world doesn't have one way of laughing and British comedy was a very dark commentary on British behavior, politics, and other related things. It isn't hard to appreciate multiple forms of comedy, is it? If you can't, perhaps you should go find something else. Maybe a knock-knock joke book would be more of your speed!So if you like to laugh and might want to learn something, go right ahead. If you love Monty Python, you'll love the references.

The Insult Simulator is reasonably priced, somewhat British, somewhat funny, and extremely short depending on how much you enjoy insulting others. It features both single player content against the AI and online matches against other human beings.The gameplay consists of crafting insults by choosing words from both a shared pool and a two-word individual pool. Sometimes you’ll choose just a noun and a verb and end it there. Other times, you’ll throw in a conjunction to create a hefty insult or choose an ellipsis to carry the incomplete insult over into the next round if the current choices aren’t helpful. For example, “Your mother | dances silly | and | looks like | your husband.” could be something you make up.In addition to all of the above, you can also make combos by using the same subject multiple times in a row. Selecting “Your sister” twice increases the honour damage dealt by adding one to the multiplier. You can also take advantage of the enemy’s weakness if you’re familiar with the character. For example, Maggie’s weakness is death. Using phrases such as “is deceased” or “is stone dead” deal extra damage against her.The real reward for constructing the insults is hearing the voice actors say ‘em. They sound like they recorded each piece individually, resulting in some awkward tones depending on the insult you arranged. The ridiculousness of it all is what makes the game funny. You can even insult someone for using Windows Vista. As a former long term Vista user, I was greatly offended.The single player has a tutorial, a one match option, and the tournament mode. The tournament lasts around 30 minutes and has you face 5 different opponents with the last one being the Morgan Freeman version of God. The impression isn’t too shabby. Winning the tournament multiple times is how you unlock additional characters like Lo Wang and scenarios for the other modes.The online multiplayer pits you against one other person for one match. Wins and losses are recorded. You can choose to have a rematch after or just leave. Simple. I’m not sure how easy it is to find online matches with the population of several dozen people, but they’re definitely there.I think Oh… Sir! The Insult Simulator can provide a couple bucks worth of laughs. I don’t expect most people to wring out more than one to two hours of entertainment from it unless they -really- enjoy the gameplay."

Find a friend to play with, skip the tutorial entirely (unless you need the achievement) and just dive right in. And, uh, try to not die of laughter while hurling poorly constructed, puerile and oftentimes absolutely nonsensical insults at each other. Seriously, it's tons of fun.The new characters and maps are unlocked via single player's 'tournament' option, in which you spend about half an hour insulting the AI over and over. The AI, of course, being AI, can't insult for sh!t so the whole thing feels like a boring grind. That's the only real gripe I have with this game.I'd say the low price is justified, seeing as Oh...Sir!! doesn't offer a lot of replayability, but!

The combinations become more interesting as you go through the tournaments.I'm glad they made the code somehow rather accurately assess the degree to which the lines are indeed funny and coherent. If a line is not sensible and still respects the opponent's vulnerabilities, they recognise the intention, but the line won't score a lot of damage because it was not coherent or logical - indeed sometimes there is not much you can pick from the random proposed lines. :) but I like that they made the difference.I have a weird problem with this game though, one that rarely occurs with much more complex games. My laptop literally boils while I'm playing it. It is a rather newish laptop. Probably the code could use some optimisation, but then again it might just be a coincidence."

It's just as fun for 10 minutes as it is for longer, some games are just fun for one end of the range. This game is as fun for as long as you can appreciate it.

A sensible addition might be reasonably denied to you, but at the cost of losing a turn. This is my main and only actual frustration from a gameplay standpoint.It's not THAT bad though.

It's strategic how one can play offensively (taking the best parts for killer insults before your opponent can, and exploting each characters' weaknsses) and defensively (taking away parts that your opponent can use against your character's weaknesses), and yet it feels like this is tougher to master than it appears.I fully enjoy this hilarious time-waster, and also...

The game incorporates elements of Scrabble, Chess, Tetris, Connect Four and Lunch Money into an amusing smack talking experience.I think if you don't like any or all of the games I just mentioned and are over sensitive or politically correct, you might not like it.

76561198042997868,Recommended,512250,26621091,"Posted: 15 November, 2016",all,Dentolux,"The virtual conveyor belt of simulator games shows no signs of halting production. In the past we have had Farming Simulator, Goat Simulator and Ninja Scooter Simulator (because back in the Commodore 64 days there was a market of people who wanted to recreate the experience of riding a child’s toy whilst wearing an oriental assassin’s mask.) Ridiculous sims remain in demand so step forth Oh… Sir! The Insult Simulator. At first glance this PC/mobile download resembles a badly drawn Street Fighter clone, complete with 1v1 battles were you must deplete your opponent’s health bar. Instead of hurling fireballs however the game has players hurling slurs at each other.OVERVIEWOh… Sir! The Insult Simulator allows players to badmouth their computer or human beings. By navigating the main menu it’s possible to slag off the A.I in a one off duel or a five round tournament, which rewards victors with unlockable content. What the deuce? I thought these days extra characters were only obtainable by paying for overpriced DLC! If you would rather slag off a flesh and blood rival fear not because the game also allows gamers to challenge strangers online and friends locally. Be aware though that developer Vile Monarch is not responsible if said chums annul their friendship with you, after being subjected to a barrage of hurtful simulated abuse.Each match begins with the onscreen characters feuding over some trivial matter. Some examples include an argument to decide who gets a vacant train seat or a complaint about a pet store selling a dead parrot. Calm down folks. No need to get mad… just buy a replacement bird from the shop in Notlob. Gameplay wise Oh Sir is reminiscent to Cards Against Humanity. Players take turns to use randomly drawn phrases like “your mother” “smells of” and “the Nazis” to construct an insult. The more elaborate the remark being dished out the more damage you will inflict upon an opponent’s ego. Watching the back and forth ill-mannered exchanges reminded me of politicians bickering in parliament. Heck, most of the characters even spout off their lines in comical British accents.VERDICTMy rating for Oh… Sir! The Insult Simulator is a four out of five. Not only did the game make me laugh, but it is rather strategic too. Within the span of a fifteen second turn players need to build grammatically correct gibes and also have the foresight to sabotage a foe’s rude sentence by removing key words from play. Advanced tactics include combos, which are triggered by using the same slur multiple times (mocking someone’s son twice in succession for example will yield bonus damage.) Mentioning subjects that an adversary is sensitive to can also inflict extra harm. For instance, fashion conscious Mr Shufflebottom is weak to any comments ridiculing his bowler hat and decrepit Mrs Maggie responds poorly to death threats.One concern I have with Oh Sir would have to be with its limited vocabulary. I imagine the game’s novelty will begin to wear thin after a few weeks play, were you hear the same insults over and over. The title’s life span isn’t a concern though, as I bought it on sale for just a quid. Even if you tire of the game after a couple of hours it is hard to feel short changed when the Steam download retails for just two Euros. At the very least Oh Sir functions as good stress relief after a bad day at the office. Venting frustrations online can be most therapeutic and it must be said that the profanities you’ll hear here are far wittier than the vulgar language one may come across in Call of Duty’s hot-tempered lobbies."

This game is fun for maybe an hour and a half, but it only has so much material.There is no real reason to use a one character over another. Each has unique phrases and a diffrent weakness, but they all play the same way. Adding to this is the fact that there are only four levels and every time you enter one whichever characters are arguing will work the same script everytime; no unique character-to-character dialoge outside of the tutorial.Trust me, devs. The monty python jokes get old after the first 18 times.The battle system is less about making coherant, actually insulting insults and more about the word ""and"". It's seriously the only way to have a senctance with more than four components, which is the only way to win consistantly. This is only compounded by an AI that puts together such gems as ""Your mother secretly adores you!"" and ""Satan is old, so, you know, yeah, innit!"" They don't really put up a fight, the lovable inbreds.Lastly, the game is so shy and coy about all the secret ways to unlcok secret characters.I unlocked every unlockable thing (3 guys, 1 location (yes, seriously, that's it)) by playing and beating tourny mode 3 times. Not really a mystery, like unlocking ""Mewtwo"" in SSBM by having a fight that lasts 24 hours, or ""The Lost"" in TBOF by... well, spoliers.TLDR: It's short but sweet.

I recommend this game to people that take jokes, nah im kidding. If you want a humorous game, play this. It has cool and funny insults and is very entertaining to watch if youre friend is broadcasting it or if youre watching a video of the game. I may have played for 2 hours only but seriously it was probably the best 2 hours i have spent. That saying might be alot used now in most reviews but I intend to put it in anyways. but not really the ""best 2 hours"" but in a way though. I wouldnt give it a 10/10 why? because I dont see any cons in this game its all pros, but its not ""perfect"" okay. Lets put it that way. So if you have below $5 and not spent it on any game yet, then get this game. I prefer it the best under $5 game ever made ""at the moment."" Again that saying might be used in alot of reviews xD. Its totally worth buying for $2. Game would totally suck if it were to be free, because I see why it isnt free.  I think the price should be adjusted to 3-4 dollars and see where it leads to, because excellent game yet again and this is just all my opinion of choice.IMPORTANT: if you got this game and finished the tournament. Dont think that it sucks and its only repititve after that. its only a new game and still lots of new features to arrive. So have patience and enjoy that there is ""actually"" a game like this that exists.Entertaining Game 7.2/10. Thanks for reading my honest review. :D"

I'd also love to see like some theme DLC's or something for this game. A lot of people suggest that a purchasable DLC with actual swear words would be ineteresting. The only complaint I have is that at the end of the tourney, the final boss Father seems way too easy even with his extra pride bar. He's way easier than any other round due to his weakness, and there being so many nouns that count for that weakness.

I downloaded and played the prototype, enjoyed that, then invested in the actual game.The character designs fit the tone of the game, and it's very satisfying to see them roll up their sleeves or stick their tongue out when delivering a particularly effective insult. The insults range from silly or nonsensical to borderline genuinely offensive. You'll like them if you're a fan of Monty Python, no doubt.The single player campaign is fun, but after a playthrough or two, it gets repetitive fairly quickly.

Nothing special nothing lackingoverall 7/10 for what it tries to achieve it could use a bit better phrase reading as it is very choppy but that is not an easy task to overcome for a game like this.

This is going to be a great party game, but it also has a genuinely funny corp behind it.You do get single player and also online insult matches, but the single player isn't really great, it's much the same and you can basically unlock everything in an hour. Online I haven't tried yet but I can't imagine there would be much there after the initial rush.And yet....yet there is still a very well made, very well voice acted, genuinely funny game there and as I said it has that ""Just one more round"" factor in it, especially when you're with friends.It's a $2 game ($1 as I write the review) so if you go in with those expectations you'll be genuniely surprised.The game may smell of elderberries but it definately doesn't have butt cancer.7.5/10 - Strong Recommendation to buy."

It has great potential to be funnier and more enjoyable if they'd ditch the negative stereotypes, though. Lo Wang and Grisha are negative stereotypes, btw.  The game could also use more words and phrases in the overall selection pool. Gameplay becomes rather monotonous because of the limited selections. There needs to be more characters as well. H.P. Lovecraft doesn't really make sense in a game like this. William Shakespeare, J.K Rowling, and Walt Whitman, historically, have delivered some stinging insults to real life people and Shakespeare's characters are known for magnificent insults.Also, online multiplayer is stupidly unbalanced, because everyone picks God and his second health bar. I realize there are more opportunities to exploit weakness, but he still has a greater advantage over everyone, as sometimes those weakness phrases are not available. He shouldn't be a selectable character in multiplayer. A greater selection of scenarios/levels would also be great.I'm not sure if I am asking too much of a 2 dollar game.I'm recommending this game for now, but that may change depending on future development."

Also this game originally from a Game Jam which only gives you 48 hours to work on a game. Imagine if they worked on it longer! I think it would turn into a great indie game!

You try to form the best insult sentnece possible, and basically insult the other person into admtiting they're a horrible person. In a rare, almost unheard of case, it's actually easier done than said here.The game's controls are really easy, with you just clicking on the next part of the sentence you want to use, and clicking on the tea-cup whenever you want to switch out your life-line sentence-fragments.The game itself is good enough for a few chuckles, mainly online or in person, where people try to come up with the silliest sentences possible. ""Your mother supports the Nazis"" or ""your father looks like your son, and wanted to be your sister"" isn't that uncommon to see.That said, the biggest flaw in the game is that the scenarios don't actually change with the characters (with at least the starting charcters), so it's kind of a letdown that you don't hear any difference in character interaction.Another flaw with the game is the ""secret touchy subject"" that the characters have. While it's useful, there is an element of RNG to it, and if you happen to be in a situation in which all the sentence fragments are against your touchy subject, and none are against the other player's, then you're a bit screwed.Overall, the game is good for a break from other games, but can still be improved as time goes on."

This game is, at best, fun for a while, it feels like it was made just to pass the time, definitely more fun with friends, but it's limited to only 2 people.The cools:Depending on how you build them, the quips get really funny.This might help out people with moderate English skills lol!The characters are fun to play as, and each character has their own sort of phrase or word you could use to diss your opponent, and their own weaknesses which the player could use to their advantage.I got to diss God. I'd love to see a poorly-created version of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the game at some point.The alrights:The gameplay will get repetitive. There's not much else to do, except to click your quips to your win. So, it's fun for a while.The visuals and mechanics are nothing special. It's like a game made withGMS.The mehs:The multiplayer is not too active. It's more fun if you play it with another friend.It's not like in a lobby where like 5 people could join and take turns dissing each other after every match like in other fighter games (likeMortal Kombat). Rather, it's just two guys, including you, in one lobby.

There are actually very little words you can use and most of the time the sentences make absolutely no sense, or don't end up even being insulting in any way. Yet you have to work with what you're given to defeat your opponent. You may get a few laughs out of it if you're lucky enough to get some decent words during a round, but most of the time you'll be hearing utter nonsense, as long as it's grammatically correct. Yes, ""hearing"", because all the individual words or phrases are pre-recorded and then spoken in full sentence in a very robotic way, like through some poor voice synthesizer.That said, the game's price is adequate.

Unfortunately, this 'unique' experience quickly becameboring.But wait, let me explain before you down vote this review!At first, the characters and ways to construct the insults(Although a bit silly TBH)were very entertaining, as I learned to create insults that would completely destroy the opposer. I even tried multiplayer, and found my odds to completely reverse, as someone said ""Your mother is your father""(Ouch).Although, this is where my enjoyment for the game ended. I started to find the insults that were made really repetitive after versing ""The Insult God"", who basically dished out the most nonsensical trash, and was able to do more damage than believable.The characters personas became tiresome really quickly, and often times, I would find myself versing the same opponent time after time again, which isNOTgood.There wasn't a good enough variety of scenes either, or at least topics per scene. Each scene only had one topic to insult each other over, and it was by luck if you got to go first.The mechanics are fairly unbalanced. First pick is pretty much always guaranteed a win. Even still, why was there no variety in how insults could play out, for instance, starting both players off with a random starter, or something similar.I can't bring myself to play this game again, even if new content was released for it, as it is simply ""beating a dead horse"" at this point. I dare say I won't buy the""Sequel""either, as most reviews indicate to it being a carbon copy of this game.Overall, interesting concept, but poor execution.(P.S. Devs are definitely milking this for all they've got, judging by the unnecessary release for console)"

It has a rather clever set-up - two twee Brits politely exchanging insults over some inconsequential difference - and its retro-art is charming... in a retro-art sort of way. But as a game it is sorely lacking in content and game-play.As a single-player game, it really doesn't stand up on its own merits. The gameplay is too minimal and too dependent on chance to be much fun. It also has a disturbing lack of content; with a mere handful of characters and locations, it doesn't take too long before you start hearing the same insults (or segments thereof) again and again. The gameplay itself is clever - each round, both players have a limited - and shared - pool of words with which to create their insult, and the game is as much as building your own zinger as preventing your opponent from doing the same. Unfortunately the end result - a point value assigned based on how insulting your creation is - seems random and non-coherent. The different characters have certain weaknesses (for instance, insults against their social status, parentage or country may grant bonus points) but even this isn't certain. Even as a party game, played against friends, the game is limited. The insults are too nonsensical, and the charm of the game's weirdness lasts about ten minutes. After that, people quickly start looking for greater depth - and there just isn't any to be found.According to Steam, I got 66 minutes of gameplay out of this title, and that was only by really, really trying; I think most people will move on after half an hour, and never return. It's just to thin on content and concept to stick with it otherwise."

I wish there were more options for phrases or insults, or the ability to type in things yourself, which I understand would be very difficult for developers to program a large library of vocab.Still, I found this game to be funny & unique & worth buying if you have seen the trailers or Ads & are sold. If you have any doubts for it or think you may get bored of it, maybe its better to watch the game rather than buy.I found it to be worth the price, but I am an avid gamer & spend lots of money on games, so a game that is worth it to me may not be to others who are more causal buyers who wait for games.

You can combine previous insults with each other, point at the weaknesses of your opponent and be harshly rude.... in theory. Most of the time you won't get the chance to make a comby, not because your opponent steals it from you to stop you from scoring high, no! The game simply doesn't give you the chance because the word won't show up again.I played 15 battles and got only 3 times the chance to insult the weaknesses of my enemy, so i can't do that either. Also most of the insults are not insults but simple phrases no one finds funny or insulting, like ""Your country supports your father."" Which made 6 points dmg...And you cannpt estimate the amount of dmg such phrases do ... sometimes you get like 9 points out of nothing and sometimes 2.They also missed to add controller support, which reduces the fun to play local coop with friends. It would be funnier to play with 2 controllers on the couch ... or it would if this game would be funny.I think this game started as a funny idea, but it is realy not worth a penny.

Luck on whether or not good lines come up in the first place, luck on whether or not your opponent doesn't take the lines you want, luck on whether or not you get something useful in the extra two lines available, and luck in whether or not the opponent has good lines tucked away for themselves.The scoring system in the game is also a major failure. Rather than relying on GOOD insults or insults that actually make sense (Despite the game itself claiming that ridiculous statements lose points), the scoring system seems to care more about stringing together as many random lines as it possibly can. I lost 50 points because the CPU had two ""and"" words added to their personal choices, almost instantly giving them the win against me. It'd be one thing if turning the tides were based on skill, but this was literally just a case of the CPU randomly getting two words that let it abuse a loophole in the scoring and steamroll me."

However, the game itself will leave you disappointed and wanting more.Choose from one of three (or four?) different scenarios where you and a random stranger start insulting eachother! Choose from one of three (or four?) different characters, each with a very specific weakness! Then start picking random words and phrases to construct a complete sentence, and hope it damages the other person! The game itself doesn't check or care about the insults you craft, only the word type. Insulting the old man? Then be sure to pick anything related to technology! As long as you get a couple nouns, a verb, and some sort of closing remark, you'll be set. ""This conversation and your hat were born in you and farted on your father, mate!""For some pro strats: If you're lucky and get some repeating phrases or words from the randomized word pool, you'll get some bonus points. Always pick the phrase that you're weak against, since any grammar penalties are worth taking over the enemy going super-effective on you.This game is extremely bare-bone, having only a few different backgrounds and sprite changes, a very small word bank, and completely randomized gameplay where winning or losing is completely up to the word pool. That being said, I did get a few laughs out of the hour of entertainment I got from this game (mostly from the computers goofing up) and the $1.99 price tag is hard to pass up for some overall fun and enjoyable gameplay. I definitely recommend this game all the way, but in the end, it feels like a missed opportunity."

Sir!!, you and an opponent take turns picking words out of a pool to craft very British insults to hurl at each other. Each player also has their own small, personal pool that only they can see/select from. It sounds simple, but there is a lot of strategy to it. Some verbs stand on their own ([your face] [is dull and ugly]), and others require a second noun ([your son] [secretly adores] [elderberries]). There are only so many nouns in the pool, so don't pick a verb that requires another noun if that last noun is going to disappear before you can grab it! There's also the very valuable ""and"" which allows you to create longer insults, special enders ([you posh fopdoodle!]), or ""..."" which allows you to carry your partially crafted insult over to the next round. You can also net bonus damage by performing combos (using the same noun multiple rounds in a row.)There are multiple playable characters, each with their own unique phrases and weaknesses (Triggers?). One character takes extra damage from fat jokes, whereas another character can't stand his sense of style being insulted. There are even two guest characters; Lo Wang from Shadow Warrior and Serious Sam.Game modes include quick matches, a tournament mode (like arcade mode in fighters), and local and online versus mode. There's quite a bit of fun to had for the price of entry.Oh, and your beloved auntie tells dirty jokes at funerals and donated organs for your cousin's hovercraft, and you can't deny it!"

Ok its a little repetitive on single player but it gets a good few giggles and laughs along the way as you unlock people and places.  Biggest gripe is as an Englishman my grasp of english is better than the games and it has moments of telling me that my insult has incorrect grammar when the sentence actually makes complete real world grammatical sense.

For a 2 dollar game you, its quite impressive in terms of how the game plays, looks, and feels.TL;DR pros con list:+ Quirky and Funny+ Has surprising elements of strategy+ Voice acting is good and the characters sound very smooth for the most part+ Game has quite a load of achievements and a few unlockables+ Very low price of $2+ Multiplayer capabilities+ Decent tutorial that explains the basic mechanics of the game well- Game doesn't have alot of content overall- Game can become repetetive over time- Online multiplayer can be unbalanced at times- Slight learning curve as you will have to learn things like good word combinations on your own since the tutorial only covers basic stuff to give you an idea"

The insults are just gibberish some of the time which wears the novelty out pretty quick if you don't appreciate the humor. Not a big loss, and most might enjoy it, but it's not quite for me. It is a neat concept. I'd say it's deffinitly worth a look if you haven't expierenced it, because it's worth the 1-2 dollers that the game costs.What I was hoping for was total freedom in the construction of insults, but you're limited by the mechanics of the game, leaving some of them unsatisfying.

Except instead of slinging special moves and uppercuts you're insulting your opponent's fashion sense and insinuating some unsavoury things about their familial relations. Wrap it around some Monty Python style skits and some wonderful satirical humour. Then charge less than a cup of coffee at Starbucks.The game itself is relatively simple. Each round presents you with a collection of words and phrases, and you and your opponent take it in turns to select words to build an insult designed to bring your opponent to their knees. Each player also has two private cards only they can use (which can be reshuffled once during each round).There's some nice strategy in picking those insults though - each character has vulnerabilities to certain topics and chaining together insults on the same subject applies a multiplier. There's also some interesting decisions when it comes to picking words - both players can see the insult being built by their opponent, so sometimes it's possible to effectively block them by removing a word they need, assuming you can build it into your own insult. These add some surprising depth to the game given the price."

It is inexpensive, easy to play and works well with two players. It has a nice chilled-out classical soundtrack, amusing accents and a cheerful art style.The AI enjoys producing nonsensical insults ('Your hat wanted to be your mother and takes pictures of elderberries!') and the game lets you get away with these, although they're worth less points. Grammatical nonsense is not permitted. This isn't as bad a problem as a lot of the reviews make out.The only things that really annoy me are the timer - unneccessary stress in my opinion - and the fact that the game sometimes comes down to luck rather than skill. While you can plan in advance to keep yourself safe from running out of sentence components, sometimes the random chance just ♥♥♥♥♥ on you. Also, the AI can be a little too stupid sometimes."

It's not graphically taxing and has a simple concept that's easy for anyone who can speak English to pick up and join in the fun. Who needs to beat a guy up in a fighter game by mashing buttons to prove that you're better than someone? In this game, all you have to do is sit back and eat chips while you serve up some soul crushing insults and, if you have the right stuff, your opponent will (canonically) run away balling their eyes out! It has surprisingly witty PG-13 dialogue recorded by surprisingly talented voice actors. Most importantly (and many developers actually overlook this) it has online multiplayer so you can break the spirits of anyone from the US to the UK.

It's fun to play with friends or by yourself.The unlocks are a lot of fun, especially the characters from other games (Lo Wang, Serious Sam and Postal Dude) and the way you unlock them is pretty well done by the developers.The game still gets updated and the updates are very nice, absolutely recommended.9.8/10 would ""You mother is your father and your sister is your beloved auntie and you want some wang"" again."

,Not Recommended,512250,34542567,Posted: 27 August,all,Krate,"This video game is extremely disappointing. This game is sort of fun to play with CPU, but other than that, it's extremely unbalanced. If you get the first turn each insult, you most likely will have a better insult than your opponent, because you will be able to use a conjunction quicker than your opponent, giving you the upper hand. Not only that, but whenever you play multiplayer the game doesn't pair you with an opponent that has similar stats, it just pairs you with whoever is online. To put it in perspective, I played only 5 online games and I was ranked #64,000 overall. The game paired with up with a player that had way better stats and was ranked #2 overall. Of course, I was demolished because I didn't have nearly as much experience with the game.It's sad because this could be a really solid game if it weren't for these problems."

I am drowning in indie games that don't interest me. They either have Survival, horror, crafting, Walking sSimulator or RPGMaker tags  attatched.This game is a huge exception. While the dialogue might not be fluid, the writing is well done, The graphics are vibrant, cheery and sophisticated. The writing is funny, and the characters are well-voiced. Anyone who likesBritishcomedy will appreciate its humor. Some of the characters are reminiscent of British comedy shows, as well as some otherwordly characters thrown in.Each character has a life bar like a fighting game, probably noting how offended a character is. you construct sentences by clicking word cards. Extra damage is applied when you make combo insults or touch upon an opponent's soft spot.Well crafted and played good sirs."

,Recommended,512250,35200511,Posted: 25 September,all,PirateDaveZOMG,"Good time-killer, but quickly suffers from the problems you might imagine after initially seeing/hearing the concept: the CPU rarely comes up with creative or entertaining insults, and the scoring system is very ambiguous.  The real strength for this game is going to lie in the multiplayer, of course, but even then there comes issues from the lack of options in crafting your insults; I personally am disppointed by how often some options come up vs. others, such as ""your cousin's car"", which I'm sure have the devs snickering because of its randomness really has no substance to it in terms of creating fun insults.Definitely worth the price though!"
