,Recommended,512300,25364856,"Posted: 5 September, 2016",all,aimei66,"-:Updated 13th September to reflect 100%ing it:-From the moment you start this game you can tell where it gets its inspiration and thats the games of Rare in the 90s. From the cute nonsense babbling characters to the light sense of humour, this is a love letter (no pun intended) to the likes of Banjo and so far I love it. The first world is brimming with charm; from the boxes that follow you around and welcome you to the little cars you can drive. I always think that you can tell the quality of a 3D platformer by how much you want to just forget about the point of it and explore, and this one had me doing it from the start (which is frustrating that it starts with a locked in tutorial).Amount of content -1x Hub World3x Quest WorldsEach world will take you around 2hrs minimum. I think most people will play it for between 8-10hrs and it took me 16hrs to 100% it. There is enough content to warrent the asking price, especially when you consider that the quest worlds are considerably bigger than a level in a game like Banjo.Gameplay -On the surface this is a collectathon like Mario64, Banjo etc, but it is not just copying them and I love the fact that it is also trying to bring something new to the table, which comes in the form of the unbox mechanic. This allows you to jump up to 6 times without landing, enabling crazy big jumps. The game suggests your health is connected to the unbox mechanic, however there are very few things that actually make you lose health which for me does diminish the excitement of it by the end.Another way in which it builds on the platformers it takes inspiration from is the amount of character interactions. Not only are their quests to find, but people to talk to about the world you are exploring adding further flavour to the world you are tumbling through.The difficulty of the game is similar to the likes of Banjo with a mixture of stupidly easy to more fiddly tasks. However the tone of the game gives you the feeling of relaxed fun even when trying to judge the gap between two distant boats you want to jump to.Finally there is the customisation of your plain brown box. Completing the tasks and parts of the story lead to customisation unlocks which means you can turn your boring packaging into a weird bounding wonder. So if definining the protagonist your way is important to you then it is there and it is easy to do (you just need to find the tailor, which took me about 10mins after the first island unlocks).Graphics and Technical Stuff.The graphics are a mixed bunch with a combination of some great water textures and rock textures combined with some very plain ones mixed in, which works for the most part but at times can seem a little strange (watch the video above and you will see what i mean). However I found its short comings did not hinder the gameplay, which based on the first world I love.It has an uncapped framerate and on my 970 rig will all settings maxed I was getting around 100fps at 1080p and there were no noticable major dips or stuttering. You can adjust things like FOV if you want and I know this is an important issue for some.I would like to note that the game did crash for me while I was messing with the settings, but I suspect this was my firewall, because when I logged back in I had to allow the game access to areas my firewall didn't auto allow. After this initial crash I had no other bugs or crashes playing the game, however there was a little screen tearing which was largely removed by uncapping the framerate (others have suggested turning on vsync in your GPU control panel).Controls -How the character controls is important in a platformer as much as any other and I found the controls to be good; although controlling an object with sharp corners meant I needed a few moments to get to grips with how the box handles (because it does handle like a box and not like a ball). The vehicle controls do feel a bit looser and I am not sure how much that is me or the game.The developers recommend a controller and because it is a 3D platformer I would agree, however I found it perfectly playable with WASAD and a mouse (mouse controls the camera and unbox mechanic while keyboard is used to move jump and interact). I could not get my DS4 to work with it natively, if that is how you like to game. However it worked great with my Xbox Elite and its paddles.One issue I forgot to mention when I reviewed this initially was the fact that the controls are not customisable. So if that is a major issue for you, then you will need to take that into consideration.Multiplayer -This is local only and while it looks fun from YouTube videos I never had a chance to play it.For Parents -There is nothing in this game that would not be suitable for children of any age. The fact that enemies do not damage you, (only push you flying into the air and into the water grrr) and the fact that all enemies are boxes make it very kid friendly. Humour and tone has some more mature ideas but there is nothing sexual or particularly violent underpinning this game.Overall-All in all, I think this is a great game and I love my time within it. It is the 3D platformer I have been waiting for and wet my appetite for Yooka next year.Hope this review helps anyone trying to decide whether to buy it. My advice is watch the video above on the shop page, it really does give a very good idea of what you are buying."

76561198025468353,Recommended,512300,25720156,"Posted: 26 September, 2016",all,WigWam,"Unbox has quickly and mercilessly shattered all of my expectations to become one of my favorite games of 2016.  Unbox is the harbinger of the Rare-vival.  Many of us feel the warm nostalgies for our classic collectathons such as Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64 and we crave something new in this genre.  But it's not the genre that we really miss.  It's that wonderful personality that those games had.  That goofy sense of humor, that hilarious cartoon approach to characters that made us feel like we'd jumped into a saturday morning cartoon.  That's what Unbox nails.  That's why you should play this game.  Unbox is fun, the mechanics are great, the graphics look good, the music is a delight but all of that is secondary to the amazing personality that this game brings to the table.  I didn't get this game for free, I'm not biased, I'm just a huge advocator of people having fun and this game is pure joy in a box.Here's a video review for those of you who need to see my wonderful face to be convinced of what I just told you:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9Hu6SAZfPY"
,Recommended,512300,25375588,"Posted: 5 September, 2016",all,Carlz0r,"WOW, this game really took me by surprise.  No, seriously, I had never heard of this before it released on Steam, but I decided to take a gamble and buy it, and I'm blown away.If you miss the 3D platformer/collectathon genre, and maybe you've been disappointed by some other indie attempts to mimic that genre, I think maybe you should try Unbox.  It does have similar gameplay to those N64-era favorites, but it's kinda doing its own thing at the same time.  Unbox isn't a straight-up clone of Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie.. it sets out to provide a similar type of game, while bringing its own unique flavor.The controls are solid (at least on a controller, I haven't really tried Mouse/keyboard yet), the gameplay and world seem polished, and the game gives you some really big, detailed worlds to explore, collect things, and complete challenges in.  It even has boss fights!At the time of writing this review, I've played about 2 hours, and I've only just reached the second world (not counting the rather large hub area), and I'm having a great time. I've been collecting any collectibles that I've come across, and I plan on going back for the rest later, because I'm actually having enough fun to maybe 100% this.If I had one thing to complain about, it'd be the music.  It's not bad or anything, you just hear it looping over and over and over and over again, and it gets kinda old after a while.. or at least the first world's music does.Anyway, this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for, and I was glad to stumble upon it.  It gets my full recommendation."

76561198006725384,Recommended,512300,34570538,Posted: 29 August,all,Krotchey,Tons of banjo-kazooie/collectathon fun. If you like those old Ty/Mario 64/Sunshine kind of games then you'll have a lot of fun with Unboxed. My only complaint is with the painfully slow intro/tutorial sequence where the dialog box pops up every 5 seconds.. the game isn't that complicated to warrent a step by step tutorial lol. They should have just had the dialog on the screen without pausing the game so you can just rush through it if you know what's going on.I love that you can collect outfits for your box haha. Just beat the game 100% and loved every minute of it (after the tutorial ended).
,Not Recommended,512300,25550456,"Posted: 17 September, 2016",all,NickShock,"This game has a lot of heart it really does. I love the box rolling mechanic, I think it's incredibly fun.Here are a couple of the main reasons why I don't reccomend this game despite the game's charm and appeal.First, right off the bat, the game has long unskipable cutscenes which wouldnt be a problem if it's not for what comes next in the list.Second, the map design in the game is great and a lot of fun. The problem is there is this mechanic in the game called UNBOX which essentially uses a life to launch you great distances. which ends up turning this map that, at the start of the game seemed overwhelmingly large. To a much smaller map due to your increase in speed and mobility. It turned all the obstacles into non-problems. This was killer for me. and what made it worse was:Third: You unlock all your abilities at the start of the game. This is what turned me off of the game. This game has a lot of potential without the UNBOX abliity The tutorial levels where you can't use it are really fun. They should have waited till later in the game to give it to you. You can really see the developers struggle to make interesting missions with this ability simply due to how overpowered it is.Fourth: The missions in this game struggle to keep the game interesting. I hate to say it, but they really do. This is for a couple reasons. One, the story itself can't really figure out it's main purpose so they really just drop you in and say ""have fun"" with no real reason why you need to do these missions. Plus most of the missions are completely inconsistent in difficulty and time to complete. This game has collectables similar to banjo-kazooie as you are probably aware. But the main ""stamp"" collectable is what gets you essentially to the next level. But one mission can take you less then a minute to complete saying ""go here"". And others that are whole races which you need to get 3 gold metals to get one stamp. I think this just goes back to the developers trying to accomadate for the UNBOX launch.Fifth and Finally: The story. The reason this is last is because in these collectathon games story is ususally of minimal importance. BUT! This story is particularly confusing. Lets get some of the minor gripes right off the bat. Other characters have somewhat inconsistant personalities but tend to stay true to their ""Archetype"". The major problem I have with the story is the fact that the developers never actually figured out a driving force. You start the game as ""The box that will save the shipping company"" which is a fantastic premise. Then they go on to the first main ""open world"" island. And tell you ""oh forget about it, go and have fun doing our missions"". It just never feels like you are making any progress despite beating the boss, and going through levels.tl;drGame has fun mechanics and a fun story and interesting level design, but is dwarfed by game breaking powerups that should have been locked till the end of the game, a story which loses purpose within the first 20 minutes of playing, and challenges which fail to remain interesting for long periods of play.The developers show a lot of potential in this game, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next.  Given a chance to learn from their mistakes with this game. Hopefully the next one is fantastic.EDIT:I've been informed by Cancer's Spooky Cousin* that you can now skip cutscenes*I know"

,Recommended,512300,25471675,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,eyesinkcrow,"Must buy at any price [✓]Worth the money but wait for a small sale [x]Wait for a huge discount [x]Avoid at all costs [x]8/10INTRODUCTIONUnbox, a game that is an open world platformer, it's like Super Mario Sunshine and Mario N64 but in 2016 which brings back the nice nostalgia feel.The game is very kid friendly which sometimes brings out the cringe but overall it doesn't change much of the experience.STORYThe story seemed weird from the Steam page, it made me think ""Do I seriously want to buy this? The story seems pretty bad tbh..."" For some reason it wasn't as bad, it was very original at the same time.You're a self delivering box made by ""GPS"" (Galactic Post Service), they made you to save the company, you're the last hope as they've put in so much effort into making you the smartest box around. You're sent out into 4 worlds, you collect stamps across them to eventually in every world fight ""The Wild Cards"" boss named ""Boss Wild"", they're basically rebelling against GPS.You'll beat all the rebels, a mystery box who watched over you finally reveals himself as the alien (which was obvious, maybe kids would be confused about it though...) he goes back to his home planet explaining to you that you're all clones of him.OPEN WORLDThis game is VERY open world, I've found no invisible walls nor death barriers (The only thing close to it was glitching up high into the air, hitting something on the way down)There's 4 worlds you can play around in, they are:""Other Base"" AKA the main hub world, it has all the collectibles aswell as alot of secrets and areas to explore. ""Paradise Isles"" which is the first proper world you're sent into, it's multiple small isles with one in the middle with a huge tower connecting them all together , you move around with fans that push you up high into the sky/ boost you in a direction, or just hop onto a plane. ""Parcel Peaks"" is a icy mountainous area, it has a similar layout like Paradise Isles, there's alot of mountains joined up by some bridges, it has fans that let you move around quickly, it's probably the most fun area aswell as the icy parts make you go flying around (So you can basically ski) There's also a rally track.""Isla Con(smth)"" Is a tropical island, it features a rally track, a dead volcano, ancient ruins and secret areas inside the mountain, it isn't like the past 2 areas, themed off of small islands joined up together but instead a huge island. It's got multiple villages. Shrek Swamps and overall it's covered in some water.The world is very detailed and seems like alot of care was put into it.CUTSCENESThis game has alot of cutscenes, I can imagine the developers struggling with them as it's a game about boxes, can't do much animations on them as they're cubes.The cutscenes themselves weren't bad, except the boxes flying in, they just seemed so unnatural to the game's physics, it's not a huge problem but it was annoying.COLLECTIBLESThe game offers alot of collectibles, 200 Golden Tapes which aren't rare but there's alot of them scattered around the map, 18 Stamps which are rarer and harder to find, 9 of them are found from doing levels for the main story. 10 Captured Zippies which are a little difficult to find but not as difficult as Stamps.When you're close to a collectible you'll hear a sound or Bounce (one of the main GPS guys) will tell you a hint.You can also go to Bounce if you're ever struggling to find an item, it'll give a general area screenshot to help.CUSTOMIZATIONYou unlock alot of things for your box, hats, mustaches/face wear, skins , clothing.You get them from collecting specific items, finishing missions, finding some characters to talk with...GAME LENGTHin 8.1 hours I've finished all of the main story, with getting 100% on The Hub world (collected all the Trapped Zippies (1) and 200 golden tapes) , around 20%-25% on the other worlds.I tried speedrunning the story though, you could probably get 10 hours of doing the main story if you would take your time, to get 100% on everything I'm guessing around 10-20hours if you're quick enough.You can have up to 4 save games, so you can speedrun one save, take your time on other one, speedrun , 100% speedrun.GRAPHICSThe game was made on Unreal Engine 4, that's pure pleasure to read if you're a lover of graphics.If you've never heard of Unreal Engine 4 it basically is one of the most detailed game engines out there.If you want a rough idea of the game on max settings 1080p check out my screenshots.For a small dev team who made the game in under 12 months, the graphics/world is very detailed, nothing is un textured or out of place.The only texture problems are when you select a new box, it'll not render proparly inside a shop but when you walk outside of the shop the box will render in proparly.VOICE ACTINGpure gold.MULTIPLAYERThere's only 4 player splitscreen and 11 player local, as I have no local friends I don't know much about it.(This game would be amazing with Multiplayer though, Developers please eventually add it as it would bring more attention for co-op campaign platformer games ect. and add more replayability)CONCLUSIONTHIS GAME IS DEFINATELY IN MY TOP 10 GAMES OF 2016The game feels like alot of care and love was put into it, it's a genuine platformer game with so much open worlds that came with the game that nowadays would be considered DLC. (I wouldn't mind DLC, this game already has huge worlds to explore with alot of content)It feels optimized, looks good, is good , fun as a platformer and a fun game to play around with in the world.If you loved all the old 3d Mario games then you'll love this masterpiece."
76561198241683356,Recommended,512300,28348656,"Posted: 13 December, 2016",all,jedidjs,"Unbox is the kind of game you play when everything stressful is going on in your life. The cute visuals and music help get across what kind of game this is going to be. From talking to the diffrent boxes, finding collectibles, to exploring the diffrent worlds, this games is one I can play and immideatly have a nice day. But is it fully worth it?PROS- The worlds are massive. I found myself exploring each world for hours in hopes of finding new secrets. The detail in them is incredible, and they immideatly get the theme across.-The music, while simplistic, is nice. It reminds me a lot of the 3d Mario games. Each song is fitting for each of the worlds. Altough for some it can be a little repititve.- Each character has a unique personality that let you know rightoff the bat what kind of box they are. Wheter they are a jolly happy box, a worker box, or a possible homicidal bunny box, each of them has something that makes you like them- All of the challenges ar simple and fun. None of them felt unfair, and I looked foorward to seeing what the next would bring to the table. From time trails, to exploring the maps for collectibles, each challenge requires you change playstyle in some way shape or form.CONS- The physics in this game, while functional, have a tendency of being a little messy. I found myself getting stuck a few times, and even had to restart a challenge or two due to some weird physics glitch.- While I was not expecting Metal Gear levels of storytelling in a game like this, the game could have been even better with more bits of story. This become evident towards the end where everythig just becomes rushed because they needed a reason for boss battles.- While I love collect-athon games, this is one of the weaker ones. Outside of a few cosmetic unlocakables, there is no real reason I found for collecting all of the tape and stamps outside of getting 100%.- The combat in this games is just very clunky. It ranges from being simplistic to frutrating. You will go from slamming enemies, to doggin missles that range from being slightly annoying, to instant kills. This is especially proven in the final boss fight, where I found myself getting 1 hit KO like 20 times.-Lastly, the game almost feels too short. With only three worlds and a hub world, the game almost feels incomplete in some way. I feel that the game would have benfited from having an addotional two worlds to make the journey feel satisfying.While these cons may seem frustrating, I still had fun with the game, and look forward to whatever the developers have next in store. If a sequel were to be made and fix some if the issues this first one had, I feel we will have a good tribute to the old N64 collector games. While $16 may seem like a lot and I would personally wait for it to go on sale, if you have the money and are looking for a relaxing fun time, get Unbox!"

It looks great and runs smooth when you have fps cap set to uncapped. The soundtrack just makes me happy and gives a big nostalgic boost to n64-era games. The platforming is original, it's something new and it works really well after an hour of messing around. Controller is needed for this. And you unlock customizables for your character!For the price even a few hours of gameplay would've been worth it. But the game is bigger than the price indicates. The game is casual and makes me feel mellow. It's not hard at all, but with the weird and fun box-rolling physics I think that's a good thing.The gameplay stays the same from the first to the third island. So no upgrades or anything, just custom looks for your box which isn't enough to make me want to collect everything in the game.The multiplayer is actually really fun if you have 4 people to play with. Chaotic fun. 2 or 3 isn't enough because of the complex juming and rolling around the most experienced platformgamer will almost always win. So it's not a great party game.It took me about 10 hours to complete (without doing everything) and that includes playing multiplayer.The game isn't comparable to super mario 64 or banjo-kazooie in my opinion, but then those were aaa-titles with the pricetag to match. What Unbox does do is give me that feeling of staying home sick when i was young while just watching cartoons. Relaxing, colourfull, smooth and fast (if your pc can handle it)."

On each map you have to find a certain amout of stamps to move on by completing all the missions in an area and finding them around the map, the mission although the same on each map are varied enough by the location and spread out between each map that they do not become tedious and boring. The abilties you have are fun to use such as unboxing which allows you to double, triple and quad jump but also reduces your lives as you do so. The story is quite fun and has some charming humor and writing. I would recomend it if you like 90s and early 2000s platformers and are eager to play something new in that genre, especaily during a sale."

,Not Recommended,512300,25487750,"Posted: 12 September, 2016",all,ROFLPIZZA,"IntroductionFirst off, I'd like to say that I saw this announced a while back and have been pretty stoked about it since. However, I was kind of disappointed when I finally got my hands on it a couple days ago. Furthermore, I only have two hours on record so there may be some later content that I did not access and therefore cannot know that it might relate to the things that I am going to write about below. Also, I guess I'll add a TL;DR at the bottom.____________________________________________________________CollectiblesFor the first half-hour or so, I found myself lost in the game's charm. It was fun rolling around as a little mustachio'd box with all my other sentient box friends but it grew kind of dull after a while.After the tutorial was over, I went on to just start collecting things because that's what you do in this kind of game. Just to explain this a little further there are three different kinds of collectibles: Gold Tape (the plentiful, 'coin-style' one), Trapped Zippies (the bonus 'free your friends!' one), and Stamps (the main 'star-type' one). Those three things are what you'll find around the world of 'Unbox.' Now, here is what I think could be improved on:I feel like there should be maybe one or two more types of collectibles. Having two hundred rolls of Gold Tape strewn about each world comes off as a little lazy, especially considering these are the types of items that tend to be collected while on the way from one objective to another. While there are plenty on the roads and paths, a lot of them are also quite hidden so the player must search high and low for them all which, normally, wouldn't be so bad but there are just way too many. I think changing the amount from two hundred to one hundred and then adding a new collectible would be a better option.Difficulty and General GameplayNext, I'd like to talk about the difficulty and other things related. The game feels far too easy and I understand it's supposed to be a casual collect-a-thon (and that's okay, I love games like that) but 'Unbox' lacks something that keeps me engaged. I breezed through whatever challenges were in my way and the only difficulties I had were from the wonkiness of trying to roll around as a cube-shaped object. While I understand that is the point of the game, I'd like to say that it's too much here. A game can be wonky and still feel right to the player (think Katamari here or even Starwhal if you've ever played it) but this game does not do that for me. Instead, I would find myself frustrated that I failed missions or missed an item due to a messed up jump because my box was laying at an awkward angle or something like that. I think the gameplay would greatly benefit from something that could add a level of fluidity or smoothness such as slightly rounded collisions or much less rough terrain. In short, the only challenging part of this game is its handling and not in a fun way.Writing, Story, and DevelopmentContinuing on, I'd like to mention the less important aspects of the game such as writing and whatnot. I say, ""less important"" because I know that these things weren't the developers' primary focus here, but since this is a review, they're worth mentioning.To put it bluntly, the story is not good (spoilers ahead). It's like this: GPS (Global Postal Service) is going out of business because they can't stop losing people's stuff. As a last ditch effort, they started manufacturing sentient, self-delivering boxes. However, this didn't entirely work and they were still in trouble. So, as a last-last ditch effort, they designed a totally new and improved box that was supposed to be much better than all the others (that box is the player). Then everyone keeps saying that you're the only one who can save GPS and that's pretty much it. ...or is it?Almost immediately, a good 'ol 'mystery character with an ambiguous moral alignment' arc is thrown in. There is no build-up, there is no point, there is only 'Mystery Box.' He also very quickly reveals that the G in GPS doesn't stand for 'Global,' but in fact 'Galactic' so this also has something to do with aliens and/or space or something. It just feels like the developers didn't really know what they wanted to do with their own game. Also, they do this thing when you continue your game or travel to a different world that automatically tries to replay the most recent story-related cutscene and I don't like or understand that at all.That being said, I do really like the world that 'Unbox' is set in. The idea of sentient delivery boxes that just want to bring things to people is cute and fun. There's also 'Mop,' a box that used to deliver mops until marketing research decided that wasn't really selling. He's sad and that makes me sad because all he wants to do is deliver mops. But anyway, the game is beautiful, the environments are great, and I really love the concept. I just really don't love the writing. In addition to that, the villains, otherwise known as the 'Wild Cards,' are super annoying. I don't mean they're annoying as characters, they're annoying in-game. The player will occassionally come across these guys whilst in the middle of going somewhere or doing something and they don't add anything to the gameplay at all. They just knock you around and they're a nuisance. But I guess that belongs in the gameplay section? I'm too lazy to move it and it's a kind of acceptable segue into the fact that I also hate Bounce. This character is also incredibly annoying because he/she/it never stops giving me useless hints from the tutorial. Please add a 'Turn off Bounce' option for everyone else to enjoy.BugsFinally, I'd like to address bugs. At the time of this review, 'Unbox' is at v1.02 and still contains a number of bugs. This is pretty okay due to the game being brand new, but it's a necessary thing to mention in a review.ConclusionTo conclude, 'Unbox' is a fun game in its own right. However, it falls short of what one might consider to be a polished game and its only saving grace is the creativity of the concept and world. There are just too many smaller issues to ignore, which is why I cannot recommend this to others.TL;DR:The game is neat but it falls short in fluidity and, to some extent, quality of content. The story is also bad but the overall conceptual part is pretty cool."

I'll start out with describing play style, then talk about the positives and negatives.Obviously, this is a platformer game bringing back the days of Banjo Kazooie, Spyro and Crash Bandicoot. In regards to world and feel, it seems that Unbox hits it right on the head. I felt like I jumped right into a platformer world which made me happy. If was to compare the movement to the likes of 2D Nintendo games, I feel like it would compare more to a faster Mario play style than say a slower Donkey Kong Country style. You do have a lot of control over the boxes movement and it feels pretty easy to get used to.On the positive side, well, this game is just really positive. The world is bright and fun, the interactions are light hearted, and the game sucked me in almost immediately. I was compeelled to start obsessing about finding gold tape because that's how I typically play these things. The box was fun to control, and yet surprisingly challenging. I thought the number of jumps you get would make it a bit easy but quickly found out how difficult it can get, but not in a super frustrating way. The game is definitely fun and I can't wait to try out some local co-op on the PC with friends!My negatives are minor at best but I'll point them out. First, there are some reports of bugs but I only ran into one. I tried max view distance (depth?) which lets you see more of the world on your screen. Max is bugged for my setup and all I had was a strange fuzzy tunnel on the screen. Anything less than max worked fine though and I quickly settled back to the 90 default so I could see up close better. Second, someone already mentioned this but I felt like reiterating it. You can tell that this game was made on Unity. The boxes look great, but some of the world objects look a bit rigid for the rest of the world. I'm sure it's because Unbox doesn't have the art budget other titles have, but it isn't something that bothers me while playing.Overall, this is a great game to sit back, relax, and enjoy the afternoon with. These are the games I love to play when I just need to de-stress! I'm really looking forward to Yooka-Laylee when it comes out, but we have a little ways to go before it releases. With the current 20% off promo, I feel like this game is a steal and you should definitely get it before the 12th! Support the platformers!!!System: FX-8350 @ 4.6, 16 GB of RAM, 2 x R9 290 in Crossfire, SSD, Windows 10 64 bit, Monitor with FreeSync enabled.

Anyone looking at this game and looking at the massive, and positive score it's getting and thinking of buying it, well three words! Go and buy it!It's a refreshing fun game that does not take it self serious.As a lot of reviewers have said already, it's like playing a Nintendo game back in the 90s.Full of charm and humour and you get that feel of super Mario world 3D or one of the great Rare game.The developers have put this on steam at a cheaper price upon early launch, but to be honest the full price is very very cheap for a really fun 3D / adventure game with platforming elements and other great ideal's thrown in to this awsome game.It real feels like it should be on a console, but we have this style of game on PC!.It's got so much stuff to do in it like shooting targets, quests for other little box buddies you meet along the way and even racing sections to.Also you have baddie's to fight and the normal Boss sort of fights to.And from the mini games you do as well, it well sort of feels a little like Mario party to!.There is so much to say about this refreshing game, amongst the norm of call of duty and battle field games, that this is original to a degree, and not some tired franchise which is loosing ideas!.I spoke to one of the Devs to ask if there was any plans for future expansions, and sequals!.And they emailed me back and said they would love to if the game does well and the interest was there.Even at full price this game is cheap, and I would happily have paid double for such a awsome,charming,fun and funny game with well balanced controls and difficultly to.Two more things to mention is it has alot of graphic options for low and very high end PCs, which you can tweak to your needs and full game pad support to.Last but not least it has a great Caribbean music which fits the game perfect, and makes you feel you are playing a Nintendo game from the 90s even more!.So all that's left to say is buy buy buy!And after if you don't like it within the 2 hour play time, then get a refund!

This just takes you back to playing games like Spyro, Gek, TY, and Croc.You jump around massive game levels as a box who can Unbox, into a smaller box, and doing so will give you a ""double jump"" which you can do up to 6 times. While it can be sometimes awkward as a box to roll around, the platforming controls in the game are extremely tight and well thought out. It's a pleasure to play.I've seen 3 of the games levels which are huge, and they all look beautiful. I highly recommend if you're not sure about the game to at least play through to the 2nd level, not including the hub, as moving around in that level is such a blast as you slide along in the ice.A small complaint if I had one was about the music in the game (at least on the 1st main level) almost driving me insane. The second levels music sounds a lot less prominent and therefore less annoying though.This is game you should definitely pick back if you want to chill and do a bit of exploring / platforming, while collecting a whole bunch of stuff."

Down to nearly every detail, it will remind you of those wonderful days of gaming.The physics are far superior to anything that could have been offered in the late 90's, as are the graphics (but without seeming too flashy). They retain the cartoon, polygon appearance we all love, and the spirit of those games is upheld even in the characters ""speaking""I only really have one complaint about this game, and it pains me to admit it, but it has made me start to lose interest just a tad. In the 3D platformers (actually all platformers, back to the NES), there were lots of short levels where you could feel a sense of accomplishment, many times, over a few hours. This game doesn't really do that for me.I enjoy open-world games as much as anyone else, but in many other successful games there's still incremental payoffs that occur fairly frequently ie. deeply interesting story and accomplishments or brief challenges with frequent minor rewards along the way. I did not get that with this game.I would play another game in this style, from the same dev's, again for sure. But I would really hope for twice the levels/worlds and 2/3's the collectibles per level. At that point it would be absolutely equal to Banjo-Kazooie or Mario 64, or all the other fantastic games this emulates. Hands down.7/10"

They nailed the tone/feeling/gameplay of the era but in their own colourful inventive world of sentient self delivering boxes.The gameplay mainly consists of free roming around the different worlds doing challenges for a cast of different Box characters scattered around the worlds. If successful you will receive a stamp form them. There is 20 stamps to collect in each world and 200 gold tapes scattered everywhere. The gold tapes are everywhere from just around on the floor to in some really hard to reach places (eg. On top of a really tall tower). There is also 10 caged box NPC's that need freeing in each map aswell as a Boss to beat. You can't face the boss until you have collected enough stamps to do so.That's where the games one main mechanic comes into play, to move around the wolrds you can do a normal jump but you can ""Unbox"" while in the air to perform a double jump if you will. The great thing is that you can do it up to 6 times to get some serious air, you'll be flying thru the sky trying to land in some very hard to reach places coz you can see that shining golden tape just waiting to be collected.You can only ""Unbox"" once for each Health box you have (up to 6). These Health boxes are in abundant supply tho so you rarely find you can't use the ability. There is also checkpoints scattered  around that when used will fill your health boxes up aswell as count as your next spawn point incase you die.That brings me to explain that there is no real dying in this game. You will see tho that you can't hit the water more than once without ""dying"" which sends you back to the last checkpoint you visited with no consequences. You migh find that some collectables are so far out that you won't have enough Health boxes to get back to land, you can hold down a button/key and it will respawn back at the last checkpoint. You might get crushed by stompers and other hazards around the worlds but again all it will do is respawn you at last checkpoint.So as i'm sure you can tell this game isn't supposed to be anything more than it is. A casual kid friendly collectathon game which has been a joy to play. You definetly see the Banjo-Kazooie influence all over this game down to the text boxes, the noises the NPC's make when talking and just the general gameplay similarities. I'd say this game is a lot easier than Banjo-Kazooie but I have only just unlocked the 2nd of 3 worlds from what I can tell (correct me if i'm wrong), so I don't know if the difficulty ramps up but I can't imagine it.You have a main Hub world which also has stuff to collect in and which gives you access to the Worlds thru doors in different areas of the Hub. The worlds look huge and is really fleshed out into what theme it is supposed to be. The first one being a tropical island them and the only other world I have seen yet is a snow themed one complete with slippery snow. Can't wait to see what the next theme will be.I found myself amazed at just how well it all works maybe being used to so many broken releases nowadays, it was such a nice suprise to play this and it just oozes Nintendo like quality control. I haven't encounterd a single bug/glitch while playing with a solid 60fps. Seriously if you like these type of games you will have a blast.There is even local 4 player races and battles which I haven't tried yet so won't comment on it.Higly recommended if you like the games which it is inspired by. However if you like your games challenging, you probably won't find satisfaction here so probably give it a miss. The only real time you might notice a difficulty spike is when you are doing challenges for stamps as some of these are on time limits, which means you might fail a couple of times but they're still easy enough to get thru.If you do wanna just sit back and and enjoy a well made original nod to the golden era of the N64 then pick this up you won't regret it."

Polished like the biggest jewel on the crown of a king, this quirky platformer generates a feeling I haven't felt for a long, long time. With surprisingly great controls, high mobility, very shiny graphics, and delightful music, Unbox coalesces all of its strengths into an experience that simultaneously feels grand and innocent. This is the kind of game of which I would have strong, fond memories, had it come out when I was a child.I think those critics just don't get it, and are applying an inappropriate set of standards. You wouldn't evaluate the animation of a Disney movie with the same standards with which you would evaluate a painting from the Renaissance era, would you? No, you wouldn't. That would be stupid.Ignore the metascore. This game is one to experience -- it's cute, ridiculous, satisfying, and surprisingly large."

If you love platformers, love quirky games then this is a must!You play as a box and your job is to save the company which is called GPS. Like all platformers of yesteryear you do this by exploring the world, collecting things, doing challenges and finding secrets. As this is a game about boxes the main things you will collect is cellotape and stamps. Collecting 200 cellotapesin in each world gives you new clothing for your box and collecting stamps lets you fight bosses and progress. In each level you can also rescue boxes that are trappped in for extra stamps. The wolrds look beautiful and well detailed with lots going in and teh humour is fantastic.I've only couple of hours so far but I haven't come across any problems and really don't have anything negative to say. So if you love  fun, funny, quirky games or platformers this is one you should play! If you don't find this adorable and cute then there is something wrong with you lol."

,Recommended,512300,33900948,Posted: 30 July,all,Jackorfiction,"I thoroughly enjoyed this ode to 90's collect-a-thon platforming. The challenges themselves sometimes got a little repetitive, but like many of the games this is clearly an homage to, it's the world, level design, story, and dialogue that kept me playing.Especially the world design, which really is top notch. A lot of care was clearly put into making interesting paths that loop around and cross over one another like spaghetti, which makes the more open hub worlds actually work instead of needing more linear levels like a lot of collect-em-ups do. I kept finding new paths and things to grab in areas I thought I had already cleared whenever I approached them from a new angle, and that can't be easy to pull off from a design standpoint.Between that and the clever bits of dialogue and gameplay references, this comes off almost as charming as the platforming giants it's giving the wink and nod to. Favorite joke of the game was the clothing store, ""Swift Tailoring"". It's delivered so straight that it actually took me a few times hearing it to get it, and when I did I burst out laughing at both the game's and my own stupidity. 8/10 would shed soggy cardboard skin again."
