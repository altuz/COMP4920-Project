I Defeated the final pirate and stopped playing when I got to the West India Company. Honestly it got a little repetitive and also I had a hard time fighting when I was limited to 4 ships compared to their 8.I did make 1 cash purchase in the store. I bought some skill points for $1 and got the HMS Victory (1st-Rate ship) for free on a promotion. (Should have bought some buildings for the islands instead as skill points can easily be earned in game) The HMS Victory made the game a little easy at first, but I quickly got to a point where it wasn't enough and I needed more 1st-Rate ships to progress in the story. I got the additional ships by capturing them in game, no more money spent.Well worth the $1 I paid for over 22 hours of fun."

And after i found out that the border of the visible map isnt the end of the world, i went exploring. I found out that there is infact an european landmass. I think im close to gibraltar right now but i have no idea really for there is no real landmarks. Yet i found it very fun to find this game to be bigger then it seems. I will write another revieuw when i find something interesting :P"
,Recommended,512470,30121449,Posted: 23 February,all,Aandreas,"Last night - I tapped this ball around for a bit, ( for 7 addictive hours ), - I did enjoy this FREE TO PLAY game.  However, I cannot work out how the dev thinks supply and demand works..It's good game - and you cannot grumble at the price = FREE. But let’s have a go. (At grumbling, I mean)!  I think this is a great game and I give it a positive thumbs up, it's just that I noticed (what I think) are non logical things happening in the trading system.I could be that maybe I don’t understand the game, (I even have doubts about my own sanity), but I think it's fair to say I do understand how these things work; because I play tonnes of trading games, both in the PC world and in RL board games etc. And have done all my life, might I add!Seems simple enough.. You see a low price ( in green ) at a port for some commodity like Sugar and take it to a High Price Value port. (in Red).  = Logical.But - the game gives you special missions ‘commissions’ too, but when you take the commission e.g. a trader in 'X' port is waiting for Sugar to be delivered, When you - buy the stuff and go to some ports there must be a glitch - because it sometimes says, you delivered the goods to the wrong port?Or even - before you buy goods - after accepting the commission. e.g. I'm in port 'A' and see a request for Cotton at Port 'B' and I can see it is for sale at a cheap price at port 'C' - I accept the mission, then go to port 'C' to get the goods and that's usually where you fail.. So - I don't understand what the Dev thinks the term 'Trading' means..I don’t even have the goods yet and maybe even travelled empty to get the goods, so why would it say I’ve delivered to the wrong port when I don’t even have the goods in the first place?Time is a big issue in this game- so building out your base facilities to generate goods to sell is your best way (I think currently), go make money in this game. Then buy ship - (I have not got my shipbuilding working yet) ;-(I enjoy the ship battles, but my advice currently, is to always check to see that you are not outgunned in 'The Pirate'. (In reference to - I love to play ‘Assassins Creed: Black Flag’, but the battle mechanics are stupid in Black Flag, I can attack a couple of Man-o-Wars and faster escorts, - attacking a whole fleet and have them on the ocean floor in no time!  - Not so in The Pirate! )With my misplaced false sense of security from Black Flag I went into battle after battle against military ships, even going up against a single Brig with two ships a Schooner and a Ketch as heavily armed as you could be. I got totally annihilated every time!  This will take more strategy - perhaps I just have to outgun the enemy two for one?Good game, Good Game. Get it - Cheap at half the price - right?"
,Not Recommended,512470,29550639,Posted: 28 January,all,Deviant,"Having put a little over five hours into this game, I have to come to realize what prevents this ""good"" game from becoming a ""great"" game.""Then why the hell did you give this a thumbs down if it's a 'good' game?"" You might ask.Well, i've yet to find any bugs, and the gameplay is for the most part pretty solid. I'd even say the gameplay if pretty quick. However, i'd also have to say it is a little too quick at some times, and this drive to have ""fast gameplay"" seems to me to be pretty ironic at times.How battles start in the game is pretty straightforward; all the ships spawn in a ""coastal arena"" type of setting, with all the ships being within sight of eachother. What's wrong with this formula however, is how close this spawn in can be. Sometime's you'll spawn facing eachother at a fairly far distance... sometimes they'll spawn to the side of you at approx. double cannon distance.Oh, and they'll also spawn directly behind you, and even in between your ships.What kind of captain would, before starting a battle, allow the enemy to sail BETWEEN his ships and then PUT HIMSELF AGAINST THE WIND, while having five other enemy ships within a cannon shot of one another. I mean, for god's sake, i'd swear the pirate that sailed into battle during the loading screen was hammered out of his mind. I kind of get the feeling of getting ""quicker into the action"" but for gods sake, the wind negates this! For example, when you're chasing an enemy into the wind and it causes you to spend five minute chasing them before you're in cannon shot range: It's at these times that the wind mechanics go from ""cool additions"" to ""aggrevating annoyances"" And when it comes to your friendly AI ship intelligence; you can tell they're hammered as well. ""AVOID THE ENEMY"" = ""Sail into the land, get yourself stuck, and then continue to take broadside bombarbments untill you sink"". It's rage inducing!To summarize, the trading, sailing, and leveling mechanics are fun. Overall this game is pretty good. What ruins it for me however, is the purely mindblowing battle spawn locations, and the aggrovating chase into the wind that serves no purpose. It's at moments like these that all other aspects of the game are forgotten, and you feel nothing but a sense of dissapointment with what WAS a good experience."

Also then you can restart whenever you want. Instead of losing all the things that you bought when starting a new game, this is the reason why I  haven't bought anything yet.Otherwise it's a great game with great graphics and mechanics.Truly a game I long searched for and final found!!!!PS: This game is also available in the windows store but there where problems with the  save files; I couldn't get passed the 3th tutorial quest. So just play it trough staem and youll be fine."

Ultimately it is a grinder game, but it is a slow one.Biggest problem:The menus were designed for normal screens, and not adapted to wide screens, so  I could not see some things.Outside of that, it is just boring."

76561197972437090,Recommended,512470,29665613,Posted: 3 February,all,Maestro4202,"I played the mobile version for a while.  Steam version is far superior.  Totally free and great game either way except for some differences.Mobile version has a lot of ads.  The upside is 250 gold to watch an ad.Steam version is far superior tho, better controls, bigger screens, better performance.Honestly tho.  It's a well made game thats totally free with an option to help fund the devs if you want to.  And it's a free full game that is very addictive and fun.  Combat, trading, graphics and overall progression are solidly made.  There's even an option to free roam the world if you want to physically sail the world instead of fast travel.  And the world feels very alive with treasure and other ships as you explore.If you're even slightly interested in this, you are missing out if you don't give this a try."

You cant turn. Its a major hassle of the game.For this reason, I cannot have fun while playing.I understand that the sails get reversed, but I sit there a sitting duckflipping sails in all combinations and nothing happens.Makes it a bad experience for me."

,Not Recommended,512470,29881935,Posted: 12 February,all,Sergeant Gunny,"I tried this game hoping it would be a something like a cross between Pirates of the Burning Sea (the older $15 monthly subscription game from Sony, with lots of detail and micro management) and the new upcoming pirates game called Sea of Thieves (which looks like it focuses on fun, team-based PVP).  It wasn't so I didn't play with it too long.P.S. You can now play Pirates of the Burning Sea for FREE thanks to the guys at Portalus Games that bought the rights to the game.  You can get it for free here:www.burningsea.com"

You can do the whole game easily and if you aren't able to pay your crew and generate money it is because you are doing it the wrong way.I don't get how people can end up doing microtransactions in this game, it gives nothing ? Maybe it will save you a little time...I like how the ships react to the wind 10/10.The battles are boring 6/10, and the multiplayer isn't balanced 2/10 (but at least there is multiplayer right).Graphics are horrible (mobile port ?) but my eyes somehow managed to not notice it anymore.But I'm REALLY disapointed with the islands, they are ugly. Have you never seen any mangrove ? Guadelupe really doesn't look like that, please improve the vegetation.Also you have to do challenges so you can build the lighthouse... But there are no challenges available ?If you want to take a look at the ships I guess you could install this game."

76561198153683681,Recommended,512470,29473071,Posted: 24 January,all,StukaGruppen13,"This is not your average arcade-y pirate game where you go ""argghhh"" and pillage ships with peg legs and eyepatches. Actual real piracy, hunting merchant vessels, sell captured goods, hiring crew, taking slaves, ransoming towns and becoming a pirate of any country you want. Also a whole boat-load (pun intended) of ships to buy, upgrade and build. This game also has a neat city building aspect, where you have to buy and upgrade buildings that produce things to sell, make money or to repair boats. Being a ""Free To Play"" means there are microtransactions, but you can deffinetly still play with out buying things. My only complaint is the music, not bad but repetitive and odd, tavern music would be nice. Overall, great game.7.5/10"
