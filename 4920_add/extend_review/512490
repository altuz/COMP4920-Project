Now that it supports online Co-op it is great. I can play this again with my friends. This game doesnt feel like a port from the Xbox 360, It feels remade for the PC. All in all i give this game a 10/10 with a ton of replay value. Hope you make the same decision i did and buy this awesome game :D Great work Netherius!"
,Recommended,512490,29240669,Posted: 13 January,all,Grizzly,"Played this game on Xbox before it ever came to Steam (I've been waiting impatiently) But nonetheless, it's finally here, and here are some of my thoughts on it:Pros:-Extremely fun-Extremely addictive-Multiplayer-Tons of customization and freedom-Can't put it downCons:-Didn't come to Steam fast enoughRating: 11/10 IGN approved ratingFor the price of this game, it isn't even a question... TAKE MY MONEY"
,Recommended,512490,29229249,Posted: 13 January,all,The Anti-Anti Christ,"One of the more satisfying zombie shooters there is. Just the way you massacre hordes of zombies, taking of chunks out of them and their swarm - MMMmmmm.This game isn't just some cheap zombie shooter that you'll play for 10 minutes and get bored of or not understand; the developers have actually put time and effort into making the system user-friendly and simple enough for new players yet haven't dumbed it down enough to remove the depth and variety of weapons and characters.Also, if you're worried that this game is a bad or lazy port from the Xbox, it isn't. I can sort of see why it took quite a while to port it from the 360 as they have made the game PC-friendly. In fact, if you didn't know it originally came from the 360, you probably wouldn't spot it; it has been implemented onto the PC platform very smoothly (V-Sync is toggleable, THANK GOD, and resolutions don't seem to be a problem which is good for someone with odd resolutions, e.g 1360 x 768 for me).Basically, if you want a fun game to play with friends, offline or online, then this is a great choice. Enough depth to make it interesting but not too many features to be overwhelmed and confused as to to be able to play the game to it's full potential."

Zombie Estate was my favorite Xbox Live indie game, and I've been hyped for this port since it appeared on greenlight back in 2012.I couldn't believe it when I saw it up on the store today. This is one of the best co-op survival games I've ever played. I've spent so many hours playing the first one and this game, it's amazing.They even added online coop for the steam release and it works perfectly. I've already met some great people today who are just as nostalgic as me. This is highly recommended, it's honestly one of my favorite games of all time.For 5 dollars this is an absolute steal, I can already see this becoming one of my most played games on Steam."

,Recommended,512490,29347953,Posted: 18 January,all,[GL] Piesmartguy,"What is Zombie Estate 2?If you don't know, you are missing out!Zombie Estate 2 is a Zombie Shoot-Em-Up that orginally came form the Xbox 360 (if you don't know what that is, you are living under a rock or you came out of cryo-stasis) where you can choose over 70 weapons and upgrades for every one of them (Almost)! there is also a good amount of characters to choose from! Why is this game good though? Let me tell you (in pros and cons)!Pros:++ Unique weapons and many to choose from (also very fun to use)++ Addicting to use the very expensive weapons and always feels well worth the price!+ 3 difficulty modes that have a very clear difference between them (health, amount of zombies, continues, etc.)+ characters feel very unique and each has different and fun weapons!+ Dance moves! (yes, this is very important to me)Neutral:= i get crashing problems every once in awhile, i don't think it is too bad. It happens whenever an update installs on the game and only for 2-3 times. It's annoying but not to the point where i should call it a negative. Try working on that.Negatives:-- I think there is not enough zombie types, i know the game came out not too long ago, but i really need that. Please-- Some characters are just plain unused because their starter weapons are so bad compared to others. a good example is the nail gun, which i find so bad that i no longer use any character with one.--Cand feel quite repetitve once you get everything you need. I think a good way to solve this is by adding more types of zombies and upping the difficulty on everything.- Not as bad as the rest, but a custom gamemode could go great for setting rounds, difficulty, health etc. If you do make this (please do), make sure you make everything customizable (health, damage, armour, ammo, modifiers, things like that!).Other Thoughts:I would strongly reccomend opening this to steam workshop. Imagine the things that the community could do to help make the game Amazing!!!Conclusion: Overall, the game is a ton of fun and even better with friends. The price is super cheap too, so i cant see why this is a waste of 4.99$ or less on sale!I'd give it a solid 8.5 and a 9.5 if you enable workshop (I'm serious, it will change everything for the better)"

There is also a dedicated server browser where you can find people to play with online. For new people, this game has alot of replayability and is very fun with friends. I couldn't reccomend this game anymore!"
76561197976001863,Recommended,512490,33965578,Posted: 2 August,all,deathx88,"The majority of people who bought this game originally played it on Xbox Live Arcade. That seemed like years ago, and after the very long wait, we're finally able to play it on Steam. The wait was worth it though, this game is still just as fun as I remember. When it comes to twin-stick wave-based zombie shooters, this is definitley one of the best. The pixel art and 8-bit zombie gore is very appealing, and is especially fun when playing with a friend.The game also seems very balanced with the weapons, characters and perks. The ridiculous amount of obscure weapons you can buy also adds a lot of replay value and offers several different strategies. Plasma swords, robot minions, healing totems, frost arrows, bio rifles, bubble bazookas, cattle launchers, orbital strikes, just to name a few. There's a lot of kooky characters to choose from as well, each with there own stats and very unique starting weapon. Perks are also worn as hats on top of the small bonuses, and you can unlock more characters and cosmetic wear by earning coins after each run. I was also suprised to see tons of new enemies and creatures every time I restarted, making each run very refreshing. This game has a lot of depth to it, and is so much better than most of the other generic zombie shooters."

(The two word review ""is $h!t"" does not count) This game is not the ""same old same old"" nor is it a ""clone in a sea of clones."" The orignal Zombie estate was realeased for Xbox 360 in May of 2010 and was a absolute blast and a fairly popular indie game. Zombie Estate 2 was realsed for the Xbox 360 in April of 2013... APRIL OF 2013!! So don't sit on your @$$ and tell me that this game doesn't bring anything to the table when you know nothing about the game itself. Not to mention, the artwork is not ""a bit rough,"" it is exactly how it is supposed to be. It is the same style as the orginal that was released in 2010. The map is definately not ""a bit glitchy."" There may be some odd things like walking through the center post on a double door but that is intended. I would not want to get stuck trying to fit through a door when running from a hoard of tanks. ""The guns are as standard as it gets""..... Really? You can get a Mini Robot after two waves (one if you are lucky) and thats just the lower tier, not even above the 10 cheapest weapons. You can even get a pet zombie with a freaking MINIGUN.Rant over... time for the acutal review :)Zombie Estate 2 was an amazing couch co-op game for the Xbox 360 that is still fun today. It was a huge update to the original adding characters, abilities, weapons, zombies and maps. It added a touch of RPG without taking away the core of the game. Now being released on Steam, there are even more characters, abilities, weapons and zombies and even two brand new maps to boot in addition to the much needed online play. The controller support is perfect (duh it was released on the 360... I think i mentioned that before) and the mouse and keyboard controls are well done. Overall this game has a lot of amazing features and is WELL worth the measly $5.Pros:-Lots of gameplay-Well functioning online mechanic-Great balance with small RPG elements-Lots of characters with different abilities to pick from-Lots of hats that change the characters' abilities-Lots of weapon types to pick from-MINIZOMBIE (tiny pet zombie with a minigun)-Varitey of maps to play-(currently) three different modesNot quite Cons:-Lobby browser currently doesn't work FOR ME (I'm certain it's my internet), but seeing as it's the only way to join online matches, I know that it works for other people-Currently (realitivly) small player base, but it was just releasedCons:-OK text scaling, don't try to play this on a 4K TV at 4K resolution at the moment, 1080p works fine though-With a good team and full knowlege of the game, Hard mode can be a little to easy-Not sure if this last one is intended or not, but the limititation of 3 zombie types spawning at a time makes unlimited mode get slow after a whileWhile there are some things that defintely can be improved, in it's current state (no pun intended), Zombie Estate 2 is well worth the buy and the time."

,Recommended,512490,29416943,Posted: 22 January,all,BaC0nz,"OVERVIEW:Zombie Estate 2 is a wonderful little game. It is full of personality. The weapons, characters, zombie types, and hats are just as quirky as they were back in 2013 (when ZE2 originally launched on Xbox arcade). You can play with up to four people online or local co-op on 6 different maps. This game is easily worth $5. Not to mention, the developer is already planning to add more weapons, characters, hats, leaderboards, achievements, bug fixes, and control fixes. It is awesome to see this support on such a small game.PROS:Very addicting and fun with friends.Over 100 weapons to choose from. Weapons vary from shotguns, swords, automatic rifles, rocket launchers, turrets, and much more.13 zombie types that act differently. For example, Goliaths move very slow but have a lot of health.  Hazmat Zombies explode dealing damage in an area when they die. This forces the player to approach these zombies a different way.3 difficulty modes (Casual, Hard, and Unlimited). Casual and Hard last up to 15 consecutive waves and allow the player 3 attempts to survive.35 characters with unique stats and starting weapons. Unlockable hats can alter character stats and help buff certain aspects. For example, you can choose a character that specifically focuses on melee or fire damage.Soundtrack is awesome and unique. The shop theme is wonderful!CONS:Some balancing issues and a few bugs. Some weapons are overpowered while others feel completely useless.PC controls could be a little better. Primarily switching through a lot of weapons is a pain (Dev plans to fix this).Lack of replay value after you unlock everything (Dev stated he has plans to add more content).A few bugs and HUD does not scale at higher resolutions (Dev is aware of this problem and is working on a fix).While it is not necessary a CON it might take a while to find a match. The player base is not the biggest. I suggest playing with friends if you can.SCORE:8/10Zombie Estate 2 is completely worth it in my eyes. The content and replay value for $5 cannot be beaten. Not to mention, the Dev plans to include even more content in the future. It is a fun little game that is very accessible and is a blast to play. I recommend that you try it!"

Would slay zombies again with a upgraded bacon slice gun!If you never heard of Zombie Estate the first two were on Xbox 360 originally years ago. They were amazing games. This is the updated version with some new things plus.... ONLINE play for up to four players! Something many people wanted on 360. Its old school sounds, graphics...etc in a pixilated flat but 3D looking world where you face wave after wave of zombies. There are three ""difficulties"" to play from. Casual which is short and has some continues. A harder mode with less continues and harder enemies. And a unlimited mode where the enemies are random every wave and get stronger as you go on. Probably the funnest mode with 3 other players joining you!You have a few levels to choose from, 100 weapons and tons of characters and hats. As you kill enemies drop money and ammo. Money gets used after each wave at a store on the level. You can use money to buy weapons and use in game coins (given after each wave) to upgrade them. And after a game, even if you lose, you earn Zombie coins to unlocks new characters (with different stats and unique weapons). Or you can unlock hats, which have higher costs but give you boosted/unboosted stats.There is PLENTY to keep you busy for a long time in terms of unlocking stuff. Some of the weapons and characters are hilarious but fun to use. Like a man whos starting weapon is a bacon slicer that shoots slabs of cooked bacon at enemies to kill them. To guns that have elemental damage. To guns that call in orbital strikes. The levels always leave room for you to learn who to use and with what weapon in hat depending on where you are in the level. There are lots of enemies with varying abilities and weaknesses.You can use a controller or mouse and keyboard. And from what I seen people on systems as far back as Win Xp seem to be able to get it to work. I have had no issues, well aside from getting to bed four hours late because I was in unlimited wave mode. lol. If you do have any issues I'd say please be patient with the creator, hes always getting feedback to patch any issues. We already had a patch, thats how dedicated he is!And the maker has said he may release free updates in the future if the game does well. Personally I am biased towards this game having played it for so many years (well the 360 version which had less content). But its probably one of my favorite small time made indie games. Defiantly give it a try, its only $5 which is amazing because I'd easily pay $15 or even $20! This is also a one man production by a man who has spent his free time putting this on PC. I honestly hope he does great!"

,Recommended,512490,29238676,Posted: 13 January,all,420% American,"So far, this has everything the original title offered but in a much more refined and PC friendly environment.  I played the first Zombie Estate on 360 with a buddy quite a lot while zoning out to music, and the sequel has implemented enough features and changes for this game to be both entertaining and challenging (although I feel the amount of chars. plus stats mixed with there being very little text present without use of context menus makes things a bit convuluted and chaotic at times).  All in all, the load of content added to this sequel makes for a much more replayable and fun title.  Tons of weapons, 4-5 maps, hats for stats, several zombo types and more.This is more than a fine purchase at the asking price of $5, and would honestly say it's a bit underpriced for the content you get (which includes local co-op, which in my mind is a magnificent feature to have been maintined in the games transistion to PC).If you enjoy killing multiple types of zombies wave-to-wave with a variety of unique weapons and need to something to play with a buddy, this is it."

Don't get me wrong it's a very fun game I've played 1 & 2 a lot on console, but after a few plays you can unlock everything really quick and drop this game really fast."
,Not Recommended,512490,29285504,Posted: 15 January,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"At this point, I do understand this title is several yeras old. Unfortunatley, I still have to compare it with titles in the modern gaming market. Sometimes older titles can still compete, and other times they pass by the wayside in the wake of newer games with more bells-and-whistles.---Look, maybe it is just my taste, but the genre of wave-fighting is spent.If you are gonna develope a game using that formula, ya gotta bring *something* fresh to the table.There is nothing inherently broken withZombie Estate 2, but it is just a clone in a sea of clones. Why should I dump time into this one? I have a metric ton of these shovelware-ish wave fighters.Essentially, its the same-old-same-old.You fight waves, and between waves you buy guns and ammo. There is local play, which wasn't really all that much fun, if I'm being completely honest. The guns are as standard as it gets (at least lower tier ones). The map was a bit glitchy, even.Pros:+Controller support was good+It's cheapCons:-Text was a bit small for couch play, which is what this game aims to be-Artwork is a bit rough-Zombie theme? C'monUnless you have some group of friends that really gets into this, don't dragyourfriends in."

This game is a blast to play with friends and is a GREAT coop game, so much that I ended up buying 2 extra copies for a couple buddies.  My favorite by far and can't ever get enough of this game!Some suggestions though- I think this game would EXPLODE if they had a custom map maker to add more maps!- Somehow adding more unlockables?  I guess that's hard to recommend when I can't think of any others myself.- Adding different zombie types!- Lastly, I'd like to know how much damage my minions do since there's no real way to tell :(I hope the creators can see these reviews and maybe impliment these!

If you have not played the original, the game is fantastic on it's own. The game has fantastic graphics (if you like the style, at least), and the sound is great. The gameplay is intuitive, fun, and satisfying. The controls are easy to get used to, there are a wealth of fun and interesting weapons to use, and there is a great variety of enemy types. The shooting feels great; the guns feel powerful and it's just a blast obliterating a massive horde of undead.For $4.99, this is an absolute steal. It's a fantastic game.

Then afterwards you can start experimenting with different combinations of characters and hats, which you buy with tokens earned at the end of every game.  Also make sure to play some co-op games, since the difficulty is ramped up (read: more zombies) with each additional player. Co-op games on Hard are always a blast trying to get past the first few levels, cooperating together until each player can get their items.Solid 9/10, especially for only 5 dollars."

You won't find a cheaper, quicker, or more fun multiplayer experience. Playing alone is fine, but multiplayer is the peak experience for sure.
