,Recommended,513000,29796259,Posted: 8 February,all,Desolater IV,"A F2P Multiplayer FPShttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ftB7JCuP68+ The gameplay is actually pretty fun, especially if you are looking for a more casual experience. It's really just a fast paced first person shooter.+ Visually I personally enjoyed the style. It's very blocky like minecraft, but I found the maps to be well designed and looked pretty good.+ Clearly inspired by Counter Strike Global Offensive, but... I actually think this is a good thing. The game even includes case openings where you can unlock skins without having to pay real money.+ The popular maps are actually well designed, some are actually direct rip-offs from Counter Strike but you rarely get spawn camped, and even if you do you have a few seconds of invincibility when you spawn.+ Cross-Platform play (Between mobile and PC) meaning there should always be people to play with, and it really is a much more casual environment for people like me who just want to dominate and have fun pwning noobs :D- Most players seem to be russian which makes it hard to understand what people are saying in chat.- The premium weapons from the DLC (mainly the Pecheneg and Deagle) are a bit overpowered in my opinion. The Pecheneg is an LMG with a HUGE clip that quickly kill players across the map (AKA Spray and Pray), and I was being called a hacker in some games as most players do not have the premium weapons. The Deagle seems to be 1-shot kill to the head which is crazy powerful if you are decent at aiming.- There are health and ammo packs in the game, but they took me a while to discover where to find them. They are kind of hidden, and cost quite a bit of in-game currency to unlock. (health packs are a huge advantage as you may expect from a shooter where health doesn't regenerate)[Disclaimer] The developers sent me the DLC for free in return for checking out the game and making the video above. The DLC is $3 and gets you 3 premium weapons, 2 addional weapons, 6+ weapon skins, and lifetime VIP. Pretty good deal if you enjoy the game, although may have influenced my opinion on the game."

At first, I was angered by how long I was sitting on the loading screen for, but then I realized that there is actually no game, just a loading screen. Which makes sense, considering the game's size.Amazing loading screen, 10/10"

,Not Recommended,513000,29597976,Posted: 30 January,all,Mr Scary Cake,"This game could be really great and I'll update my review if it changes, but as it stands there is something severly wrong with the balance. My first game I had a blast. The map had lots of corners and hiding spots and I felt immersed. I would double back on a teammate who would take care of the enemy from their blind spot, the group moved as a unit and everybody was watching each others backs, it was great. I felt my weapons weren't doing a lot of damage, but overall I didn't feel overwhelmed by other players despite just picking up the game. My kill to death ratio was about even and there didn't seem to be that much of a disparity between me and my opponents' weapons.I used some of the in-game currency the game gave me to purchase the shotgun. I figured the standard uzi was lacking that punch feeling because it was a rapid fire weapon. My second match was a sniper's wet dream. The location was great for snipers, both teams started in opposite cubies and went across one of two desert lanes with a few boxes. Not being high enough level to unlock a sniper, I tried to make the best of my situation and started using the pitiful pistol. I died in around three bullets from an assault rifle, normally one from a sniper rifle. Was my shotgun as powerful as these rapid firing weapons? My thought was that since I only had a two bullet capacity that it would be amazingly powerful. Twice I was five feet from the enemy unloaded both shots and it didn't kill, it seems that it is only a one shot kill if it is a headshot from close range, so you should never take the weapon because a head shot kills from both the assault rifle and sniper rifle and they hold way more bullets.... a shame I can't unlock and use them.This game has that mechanic where people drop their guns when they die, so you may think it may not matter what gun you have because you can always grab a different one from someone's corpse and level the playing field. However, bare in mind that you are grabbing that gun from a place that someone just died and you will not keep it if you die. The rate at which the guns stay is not very generous, sometimes they stay a while, sometimes they don't even hit the ground before they despawn, so.... not sure what to tell you there.My first match showed me the game could be fun! But with so few people playing and being unable to be very competitive on certain maps without leveling, the game isn't that newbie friendly. Which means this weapon issue will continue to be a problem. I know that is how this game makes its money being free to play and all, but I can't say I will play another match."
