Absolute YouTube bait.Edit: I'm being downvoted by trolls, but it's critically important you don't buy this game, so let me explain a little more.* The game boots up to some pretty good music, but you cannot skip through any of the logos.* You try to make a character and are treated to dozens of skills (including kindness, mental faculities, temper, etc). These skills don't do anything.* You must then write a bio OVER 140 characters. You cannot start until then.* The game starts* You sit through 5 minutes of text. Even if you speed it up, it's painfully slow.* You start a tutorial after 10 minutes.* If you don't follow the tutorial instructions perfectly, you'll be sent back to the main menu.Edit:If you manage to make it past the tutorial, you'll find that this game is just an old fashioned  beat'em up (even bird poop hurts you) with some platforming and puzzles.You can't save, but there's a checkpoint at the beggining of each chapter.Enjoy.Edit: For a full review, please visithttps://theradlands.com/2016/12/02/the-underground-man-smoke-and-mirrors/"
,Not Recommended,513230,32327762,Posted: 10 June,all,Death2Sam,"Read the reviews: this game is barely a game. It's hard to tell whether this is a scam or a joke but this game is essentially the world's slowlest text speech with gameplay that will send you back to the very start (pre-tutorial) no matter how far in you are.Saying this is a joke doesn't excuse it. There are so many games (e.g. Garry's Mod, Goat Simulator) that are just jokes that are enjoyable as games and funny as jokes. And saying it's a look at games themselves doesn't work either because, once again, there are so many other games that do this but work as games (e.g. Pony Island).That said, though, the music and visuals are nice. I don't know whether, if you actually manage to power through and make some progress,  this game has some good moments.However, overall, this game seems like it could be a cool idea (either as the serious game it's marketed as or a better executed joke game than it is) and could've been fun but, ultimately, it's just infuriating and borderline unplayable.EDIT: I've done some more research and people are saying that to be able to understand this game you must be Russian. Apparently, it references Russian internet culture and is a parody of 1990's games from Russia. Maybe, if you're from Russia and remember this time, you'd love this game but from my point of view it wasn't fun. Let me know, if you played it and it was good from the Russian point of view."

76561198034642823,Not Recommended,513230,25398225,"Posted: 7 September, 2016",all,Citizen of Steel City,"I suppose that many people remember the slogan of Interplay “By gamers for gamers”.I think the real slogan of Mehsoft would be something like this: “By (greedy) trolls for (stupid) trolls”.More correct (and not politically correct) slogan could be “By goo dwellers for goo eaters”.They claim The Underground Man would be “old-school hardcore game” and other pretentious nonsense like this. But devs are simply trying to get easy money by FALSE POSITIVE RECOMMENDATIONS AND REVIEWS (written by Mehsoft’s fanboys). The truth is The Underground Man nor “old-school” neither “hardcore” game.1.	They say that there is an enjoyable retro-graphics here. But it’s not true coz in this game we have very bad (rather eye-damaging) graphics. The only true thing that the graphics really looks old.2.	Devs designed this game to include bad mechanics on purpose as a parody (as they claimed to), but they literally crossed a line and have made the bad game itself, maybe the WORST GAME IN 2016. The game’s design is lazy and uninspired. The enemies and bosses are boring and the game relies much too heavily on instant kill events everywhere for difficulty in place of clever game design. The Underground Man is difficult only for difficulty's sake and not particularly fun to play.3.	Clumsy and repetitive gameplay. And as I said the game is built around the difficulty itself. So it means that almost every part of the game is designed to kill you, particularly in certain areas (that’s the only idea of the devs). Fun for trolls probably but not for humans.4.	You’ll be dying in this game very often so you have to start from the beginning of the game coz you can’t skip it. And remember there is NO save/load system in this game. Hardcore? No, just a bad design, for sure. And you know how wasteland by Mehsoft looks like? A LOT of empty screens. But the truth is that being bad and poorly designed on purpose doesn't really work.5.	The gameplay of The Underground Man is boring and unfriendly coz devs tried so hard to capture the ""crapnes era experiences"" that they forgot that people not only would have to play this game but people would be paying money for this product. It would be less offensive if the devs don’t lie and write the truth about the game in the Steam.6.	They say that slowly moving text in game was made for fun and hardcore purposes. It’s another lie. The game is so SHORT that devs slowed down the speed of text to prevent completing the game before 2 hours and refunding this game after the game’s end. And besides you can’t skip the dialogues in the game.7.	There are too many poopy jokes. Really, even for non-squeamish persons. Btw the game text and dialogues were written in the “13-years old schoolboy” (besides not clever one) style and the devs didn’t hire any editors and proof-readers so your eyes would literally bleed when you read the text in this game.8.	Maybe you believe in the devs’ statement about unique system of character development? They lied (yeah, again) because the creation of the character doesn’t affect anything (except biography but I’m not sure) and there is no real development of the character in this game.9.	To my surprise there is rather good music in the game.10.	And last but not least - there are some bugs in this game. Really, the hive of bugs there.THE MAJOR PROBLEM with The Underground Man – the devs forgot (I’d rather say they are so greedy that they don’t care) that people would be paying money for this product. The meaning of parody and satire is clearly lost when you have to shell out money to play such a bad game (like The Underground Man).Let's be honest here. It's the bad game, even if you ARE a fan of Mehsoft. And if you're not such a weird person there are NO REASONS to play this product of Mehsoft.Everyone knows that good entertainment is good and bad one is bad. It’s a simple idea but fanboys of Mehsoft will keep LYING IN POSITIVE REVIEWS to justify their purchases. Sheep will be sheep even they are acting like trolls. BAAAA.So if you are human being AVOID this trollish game by all means. Sadly it’s the only playable option for this game. But if you are a curios person (like me) don’t forget to refund before the game’s first 2 hours ends (like me).THIS REVIEW WAS CREATED IN PURPOSE OF SAVING YOUR TIME AND MONEY.Для русскоязычных пользователей (буду краток):Игра позиционируется разработчиками как «пародия и перфоманс» (но не в стиме, чтобы не уменьшить продажи этого продукта, что характерно), при этом игра настолько плоха, что ее не спасает большое количество сортирного юмора (для любителей подобного, хм, продукта). Плохой игровой дизайн, низкое качество текстов («буриться в землю» - это не энурез, а землеройные работы), графика в стиле «вырви глаз», намеренное недружелюбие игры к игроку в стиле гопника, отсутствие возможности сохранения игры и умышленное затягивание игры путем медленно прокручивающегося текста.Если вы уважаете себя, не покупайте эту игру (даже из любопытства как я).Рейтинг игры накручивают фанаты какого-то Мэдокса «ради шутки, лол». Но правда в том, что шутка эта именно такого свойства как показано было в одном старом советском фильме (см. ниже).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdLojckn-HM"

Very boring.So, you can't skip the beginning; if you die or fail and that happens pretty fast, you have to start all over again; you can sit there, hold left shift, what makes the text move a little bit faster and wait through the at first a little bit funny, later somehow frustrating and now just boring text. OK. And if you obeyed and made no mistake, you can start wandering through the wasteland, screen after screen, and after many, many screens without something happening, a lame joke. OK, then it repeats itself.And then I just wanted to die, in one of this meaningless ""fights"", so I did. And then I wanted to write a review, telling other ones, that the concept of this game is far less funny as you would expect reading the other reviews. It's just infantile - or less; written by a thirteen year old? - and plain boring. (And don't forget about the frustrating part).And now: Adios, Underground Man, I'm claiming a refund, because I don't want the developers to get my money for this crap.Of course the game is some kind of joke; but a joke only on behalf of the player? You can do that if you want to, but then you have to expect people wanting their money back. And the joke is a pretty lame one. (Players, who want to question the concept of games itself could play Pony Island, for example, because there both sides tend to be satisfied.)And I tend to believe the positive reviews are from people somehow associated with the devs - or some weird fanboys, who like the devs attitude that every crap can pass greenlight -, cause seriously the game is just a piece of crap (as the dev said himself).Update:I got my money back!"

Not to anyone I can think of. I feel like I have to justify why I spent the better part of 6 hours finishing this game. Don't speak Russian, but as far as I can understand this was a joke to see if it could get on Greenlight, which seems about right. I liked the music and general aesthetic, and I guess it's nostalgic for me in a way I'm not entirely certain it was intended to be. The whole thing is vaguely reminescent of a computer game we would have played in the 80s or 90s because there was nothing else to do.That isn't really a rationalization for why I finished it now though, because I have a high end PC and hundreds of games in my library to choose from, many of them far less deliberately obtuse, plodding, and mean-spirited than this. What I can say is that the game♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off enough to keep going, I liked the action and the world, enjoyed the music and sound quite a lot, and I was basically interested to see what would happen next.People seem to be saying they can't get past some of the platforming/beat em up sections, but those are mostly simple and I found them enjoyable, apart from the long wait to get back into the game. The text bits are the real killer. A lot of the things you need to enter are very precise and some are nonsensical, especially in Mitino. I think these were put in the game to really sort people into two groups; psychos like me who would finish this entire game for some reason, and sane people.Got some laughs, swore at my screen a little bit, but I was glad to finish it. I don't know why Russians like terrible old memes so much though. I also like Bloodbath Khavkaz, but this is honestly a better made game than that.

Allusions to the old-fashioned nostalgic moments, such as racing and a Helicopter-Boss of Dandy and Sega times will definitely make you feel that this game is MUCH more than just a simple experiment on a parody.Moreover, the author of the game, Ilya ""Maddyson"", is a very influential figure in Russian gaming industry. He was the first Russian ""Angry Video Game Nerd"" and many people do call him a founder of the whole Russian video-blogging. Being fed up by the adsurdity of many trash games of old times, Ilya has developed ""The Underground Man"", which is a galant bow to the era of hardcore, fully-involving video games.

Aside from hilarious and gripping text-based dialog/narration, The Underground Man is a mish mash of 2D platformer with not quite bullet hell action combined into one. Ironically, it was created to parody low quality games that make it through Steam Greenlight but instead ended up as quite a jewel.It's easy to get caught up being frustrated as you die over and over again, as you inevitably will. However, the further you get into the game, the more you realize just how every aspect of it cumulates into one huge troll. I wish I could say more but that would just spoil the fun. If you relax and enjoy the (very salty) ride, you won't regret it. Maybe.There is one caveat. The Underground Man was created with a lot of Russian culture and memes in mind, so some things won't seem funny or make sense unless you have a nice Russian friend on hand or personal experience. Some other minor flaws include that the Russian to English translation is not perfect and some of the text answers are annoyingly specific. For the former, I actually see the sometimes awkward translations as part of the game's charm. As to the latter, using the hints feature will help greatly.One of the best parts of The Underground Man is that once you beat the game yourself, it is still endlessly entertaining to watch your friends have a go. Their rage as they progress through the same trials and tribulations you went through are as rewarding, if not even more so, as your personal victory."

И самое главное: очень мало экранов при переходе между локациями (ну, всмысле, тех где как раз птички, враги или пустота).Я планировал посмотреть трилогию Крестного Отца пока ходил между локациями, но из-за урезанного количества экранов добрался только до середины второго фильма."

For me, it even has seemed very simple. Has passed within 5 hours.About money: 3 people for 3 months, with no experience, did the enthusiasm of the game. For zero dollars salary. Everyone wants to eat a meal. This is not a No Man's Sky where the money collected and posted 20-30% of what it should be. The game should have been much worse and unplayable. It is 30-50% more content than expected by fans and up to 300-400% if you play half an hour as you, but at least 3-6 hours.About the idea: The idea of this game came after the developers stumbled upon streamers on it.http://store.steampowered.com/app/431740From this game, you really ""Burn.""

And think about everything with humor.""PS. Buy at your own risk.

Это просто откровение, я до сих пор не могу отойти от финала и суровая мужская слеза катится по моей щеке, хочется настоящих мужицких объятий людей которые тоже прошли эту игру KappaPride. Такую бурю эмоций я давно не испытывал и кажется игра лечит от игровой импотенции.Если серьёзно:-Игра сделана очень качественно, учитывая 0-й бюждет и малую команду разработчиков.-Узнаваяемая бытность россии, мемы нижних интернетов, твича, ААА-игр, стримов Maddysona создаёт теплую атмосферу на душе.-Сюжет и тексты. Просто уйма текста который очень качественно построен в сюжетном плане. Более глубокой и проработанной игры со стороны целостности сюжета сложно вспомнить.-Забытый жанр. Попробовать текстовую РПГ было очень приятным экспириенсом.-Челенж. Вы будете вскакивать, ругать матом всех и вся, кидать наушники и гейпады в стену, но продолжать садиться, чтобы победить игру. И когда вы побеждаете её той бури эмоций, что вы получаете хватает до самого конца.-Отличнейшее музыкальное сопровождение!

Гори в АДУ Т.Г.PS: игра на твердую 9, потому что разработчики обещают(Обещания от Ильи Kappa) готи-эдишн под новый год, где будет доделано всё что было задуманно, а задуманного хватит чуть ли не на 2-ю часть. Брать сейчас чтобы насладится оригинальным приключением и ждать дополненную версию.PSS: Если очень серьёзно: для ярых поклонников Мэда 10/10; для людей знакомых с его творчеством и всем что/кто крутится вокруг него 8/10; для просто мимоигроков 6/10.
