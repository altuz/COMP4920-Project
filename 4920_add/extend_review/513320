,Not Recommended,513320,26441035,"Posted: 5 November, 2016",all,Ronny,"Terrible movement system. Stearing with your head and sliding forward by pushing the track-pad. No teleport option. If you affected by motion sickness do not play this game. Slow paced and quite boring gameplay with very simple puzzles. Obviously designed as a seated experience, not taking full advantage of room-scale and motion controllers."
,Not Recommended,513320,31322131,Posted: 23 April,all,krank23,"+ At least it looks like a complete game.+ Does not explode nor eat your kittens.+ Once graphics are turned up, the uninspired assets at least look decent.+ One or two not-completely-horrible outside vistas.- The horrible, horrible controls. Unintuitive, contrary to every guideline regarding how to use HTC controllers to interact. Movement is vomit-inducing, non-teleporting and unidirectional (only in the direction of the MHD; no strafing etc). The car only seems to cooperate about 20% of the time when going backwards. Picking up things and interactions are all trigger-based, regardless of context (i.e. grip controller is never used, for instance). Throwing is a button rather than based on accelerometer. All in all, the designers of this game very apparently did not design the game with VR in mind, or at least not the Vive.- Instability. The game has crashed or become unresponsive 100% of the times I've tried to exit the game, and also every time I made the apparently fatal mistake of pressing a button (any button) during the way-too-long intro sequence.- These ""puzzles"" aren't puzzled. ""Puzzle"" implies using the brain in some way. This is just trial and error combinatorics. Five switches, experiment with them until you activate them in the right order. Move this robot around this grid, we'll give you absolutely no clues as to which squares are safe. Experiment. Trial and error. Seriously, go play some Myst or even some old point and click Lucasarts game. Or pretty much any puzzle game. These are not puzzles, they're patience gates - You Must Be This Patient To Continue.- Uninspired, clichéd ""surrealist"" imagery, and equally uninspired sci-fi aesthetics.In short: not worth it."

I am very excited by this game's story, setting, and tone.  It's Alice in Wonderland reinterpreted to be a sci-fi puzzle-em-up adventure game.  What more could you want, eh?The puzzles are a little simple at the start, but I am assuming that is because the game wants to establish the basic mechanics/language for the puzzles and then will ramp difficulty.  As for the story, there more going on than what I have seen in my limited time playing, and I'm intrigued by the few snippets of over-arching plot that have been teased!Overall, I have found ALICE VR to be an immersive, engaging, and beutiful game that I cannot wait to keep playing.I know some of the reviews mention graphics quality, but I think those issues have been patched already and, based on my anecdotal and limited experience, the concerns seemed limited to Vive users (the game looked amazing on my Oculus and when played in 2D).If you're curious to see how this game plays, take a look at the video below (there is a short clip of the game running on the Oculus headset towards the end):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EciWCcgoNYs"

Remember folks, this is still the 1st generation of VR.No the bummer. I only managed about 10 minutes of actual play in my Oculus Rift due to the fact I felt so ill while playing. This is the first time I have had this happen so quickly (it did happen with Project Cars after about 2 hours). But I'm still not going to mark it down, due to the fact no one else seems to have this issue, so I guess this just isnt for me. The fact I can still get back into it without the VR means at least I can still play it."

There are some puzzles you occasionally have to solve inbetween unlocking the story, but I'd hesitate to call that 'gameplay'. I kind of feel like the 25 dollar price tag might be a bit much for this. It's like Solus Project but with less actual gaming elements.Still, other than the blurry visuals, everything else is well polished and  thoughtfully crafted towards a pleasent VR experience. Normally I don't like story simulations, but VR kind of changes that. When certain mechanics are well done (locamotion, asset / ui polish, voice acting, setting, story) it's enough to make me forget all that and just enjoy the  wonderful vr experience.I'm only an hour in at this point, and I don't expect to have my mind blown by the time I finish, but certain moments did stand out in that first hour. Driving around the planet in a the vehicle for starters. The driving was super smooth, caused no motion sickness, and really made me feel like I was exploring an alien planet.There was also kind of trippy dream sequence that was short but enjoyable. I'm guessing i'll see a lot more of these as I delve into the story.So there it is, the game puts the right amount of attention on the core mechanics and fundamentals that I can recommend picking it up despite the somewhat high pricetag. It all comes together for a really immersive experience and that's really what I'm here for."

However, the controls of the game have been designed for a basic RPG (controlling the head with right stick, and the movement with the left stick), which, when turning the head, is the best way to create the worst puking feeling.I survived about 10 minutes before asking steam for a refund. And that was not even in the gravity bending puzzles.I am quite sad, as I was looking forward to a new game inspired from Alice, and another game in space."
,Not Recommended,513320,26548486,"Posted: 11 November, 2016",all,MDuh,"I realized after I reach the driving part of this game that this was designed to be a seated experience masking itself to be room scale.Even though this was one of the VR games that impressed me graphically, always relying on Async Repro to get a smooth @ 200 supersampling is not the way to go (P.S: Got 980Ti)Since this was a seated experience, I can only play this game 15 minutes at a time before nausea kicks in (The driving part even accelerates the puking threshold). I refunded the game because I'm already having problems before the physics bending part of the puzzles which some people expressed problems with motion sickness, not only that, but this game seems to be veeerry slow paced (AKA: Boring) and very little to no action when I watched some playthroughs to what I can I expect next. I'll be honest though, I would have not initiate a refund if they made the driving at least use the 2 controllers to be like a steering wheel.Also I know the dev has stated that they will be implementing teleportation, but I doubt that will help on that upside down puke inducing puzzle part.I'll get this game again maybe after they implemented teleportation, but definitely not at full price when I bought it. I'll be waiting for the 66% discount sale."

To me, it seems game designers are more art/voice actor/textures and asset focused. This is good news, because on the technical stuff, you will run into trouble here and there when playing this game.The game does offer a variety of puzzles and varied environments. The starting area of the game required some extra puzzle solving since I had to figure out how to proceed through some of the corridors that were narrower than their appearance."

Firstly I should mention i'm playing on the Oculus Rift and it works easily and well. The turning does give me strange sensations as many games that don't use the tick turning technique. So far the puzzles are extreamly simple. Its essentialy a walking/driving game that has puzzle elements and its got some surreal elements as you would expect from an alice game. The story is interesting and theres some strange hints in some of the recordings you find so I'm deffinatly wanting to know what happened on the planet. Overall I think its an OK game. Its not brilliant but it is Okay.(remember I'm still early on in the game, just under an hour spent)) I think you will be playing this game for the story and to see the surreal elements (like flying sharks)My recomendation is if you like Alice in Wonderland and you liked the surreal elements (not the gameplay just the surreal attitude) of American Mcgee's Alice and you like walking/driving simulator with simple puzzles then this game is something that will deffinatly keep you entertained.p.s. I am finding the interesting points spaced out just right, but people who want a fast acting game will finding it slow and pottentialy boring. So be patient and just sit down when you have spare time and enjoy."
,Recommended,513320,28177598,"Posted: 3 December, 2016",all,Quintaar,"Experience not on VR. (for now)The game is slowely paced at first, perhaps maybe little bit to slow as interactions are scarece. It picks up later on a bit. I got to it after playing Firewatch and willing to try another story based title. Story driven, with nice enviroments.  What annoys me the most is that game actually introduces interesting game mechanics and then refuses to use it for more interesting gameplay. Shame. I suspect that the pacing and the movement speeds are made to accomodate the VR experience.This game is in a nutshell:Half-Life (sadlly the opening sequence)Firewatch (complexity of the game mechanics)Portal (the setting and environments)Any FPS (the puzzles)Positives:*Looks great*Interesting game mechanics (increase/decrease your size, gravity defying platforms)*Alice in Wonderland inspired*Interesting narrationNegatives:-It can be slow, without giving you many interrations-Simplistic puzzles - aimed at younger audience I guess-Not everyone is fan of Alice (dream alike sequences)-Under-utilised puzzles and  shrinking mechanics.Conclusion:I'd like to see the game through the VR some of the changes in the environments would look impressive (collapsing structures, changes in perspective). I'm not sure if it would give me any motion issues or not, but it it one of the better looking games so far and immersion must be great. It's good to see a finished product rather than something that looks like a simple 5 min tech demo. Alice VR introduces few nice concepts but fails to play with it through out the experience. Levels are big in size but not terribly interactive. A lot of work was put into how the level should look, but then you will end up with 3 buttons to press and a simple puzzle to solve to get to the next stage."

,Recommended,513320,29493974,Posted: 25 January,all,Shadow,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEcuhPtso_kWelcome to Borderlands Adventure VR... err wait, no... Alice VR!If you're a Borderlands fan, you might mistake Speculo for Pandora on a few rare occasions. There are some similar gameplay elements. It's just missing the Psychos and all too easy to love/hate main villains.Not only is there a system that is visually and mechanically similar to the Catch a Ride system(https://youtu.be/LEcuhPtso_k?t=2773)but also elements such as an Echo Recorder equivilent and the coveted Graphene (Eridium.)It's a vague comparison but I see inspiration in enough places to make me smile.To the actual game:The setup...I had a few issues getting the game up and recording. I mention the recording issues with mirroring in the video and it's mostly just YouTubers and Streamers that that impacts so I'll skip that.I did forget to mention the other issue though. I had several game crashes while trying to load the game up. When I would pull the trigger on the loading screen I would crash the game and receive a fatal error pop up. I was instructed to not do that anymore.... Waiting for the game to fully load before touching anything worked and I was able to run the game flawlessly after that. Obviously...They are working on patches and are aware of it so hopefully that will be fixed soon.There are a plethora of options. More so than a typical VR title. Several languages, graphics and audio sliders to mess with. Not as much as a desktop game but still in the top tier of VR atm.There are also several locomotion options which gets a big thumbs up from me.I really liked the look of the game. It did look better in the HMD than in did on the mirror window. That could be my fault though due to me trying to minimize the black bars.I also really liked the voice acting by Heart and CAT. The scattered journal entries are a nice touch for delivering story as well.Walking into the hangar for the first time was one of those wow moments. Around 26 or 27 minutes in I think. You walk through the door and you're greeted with a hanger that reminded me a lot of my Star Citizen hangar. It was just really cool, and made me want Star Citizen VR all that much more but that's a rant for another time...There were several wow moments like it but this was the most memorable IMO.Dr. Who Sharks. The end.There seems to be a decent amount of content that validates the 24.99 price tag.The not so good:There is a puzzle to escort a bot over a pathway. It's a memorization task so you'll have to restart several times. Reloading the puzzle and getting a new bot takes far too long. Roughly from a failure at 18:35 to being able to move the bot again at 18:47. Seems like a minor issue but it's annoying waiting on the bot to reset and your pretty much guaranteed to mess up a few times. Maybe it is a petty complaint but it just wasn't enjoyable and stood out compared to the rest of the game.The artifical gravity room. This got pretty close to the Doom lift.(https://youtu.be/9Q0J3zsLbWY?t=3353)I'm pretty good with motion sickness. Relatively iron stomach for most VR experiences. The world rotating around like that was uncomfortable. Thankfully it was just a short period. You can navigate it in under 10 seconds or so. I recommend staring at your feet.Speaking of motion sickness, the buggy might be uncomfortable for some. I was pretty much ok but I could feel some discomfort trying to creep in. If you're prone to motion sickness, you might want to bypass the buggy and walk/teleport. Let me know in the comments below if you had issues with the buggy. I'm curious what others thought.There are some graphic glitches that are immersion breaking at times. Such as the terrain creeping up and down the edges of objects as you move forward/backward in relation to the object.Headlocked trackpad locomotion instead of Onward style trackpad locomotion. Though with the strafing ability this isn't as bad as games that only let you move forward. It's definitely not a worst case scenario. Just a hair shy of ideal but worth mentioning.There was some weirdness with my floor bounds that had me feeling like my height was changing. Still need to figure that out. Not sure if it's Vive related or Alice VR related so I should probably exclude that from the review. Forget I said it..."

It seems as if you can't so the keybaoard option is pointless and unnatural to use. I'll use the controller from now on, but that means I probably won't ever play the game tbh.  Maybe I'm missing something? Looks like a good game otherwise.I understand VR games need to be different to 'normal fps games', apparently to fully appreciate environment.Being honest, I just want to play VR games the same  way I play other fps games with mouse and keyboard...

I felt disoriented and motion sick within the first few minutes and I couldn't last any longer than 15 minutes when I first tried it. While I understand a teleportation-based system might make the puzzles less fun and diminish the gameplay, the trackpad movement was simply unplayable to me without sickness.If you don't get motion sick in VR at all, this might be a great game for you, but I can't recommend it if you are susceptible to VR sickness in any other games."

Be another year before 4K headsets hit the market. TIll then we're looking through a screen door at most things. Had to stop playing because the floor texture wasn't level with the rest of the map, thus trapping me in place. Annoying. Will wait a while before attempting again. Hopefully developer will address the issue. I would still recommend this game though. It feels like early access in some ways, but definitely could be something. It kind of reminds me of Solus Project. Great game. Now...if I could just keep playing without being stuck I could see just what this titles has to offer. You may want to wait a month or so before buying, pending another set of patches. My 2 cents for what's it's worth :)"

The graphics were rough at first (1080) because of the issues they were having but promptly fixed it and it looks amazing now. I have in-game set to 220 scaling with graphic settings maxed out and it runs great. I like the puzzles mixed in and like that they aren't too hard to where you get frustrated. The gameplay is slow but I like that for an exploration game like this. I like starting out in a desert with similar feeling to The Solus Project and then making your way into the city. The sound is great. I only have 1 small complaint so far and it's really small but I had a hard time turning around the dune buggy in tight areas. Everyone begs for a story-driven game for the Vive and the devs delivered. I definitely recommend this game! Good job guys.

I have an iron stomach most of the time, but this game made me feel really, really sick.Also, the fact that i have to point and click a lever in order to pull it in the game, other than say, er, just reaching out and pulling it with my hand, is a huge red flag that this game was ported to VR (Vive) as an afterthought. That, or the devs just don't have a clue what they're doing. The controls are. just. bad. No blink option? No comfort mode. Either way, the defaults make having vive controllers about as useful as a gamepad with a built in laser pointer.I'll give it props for nice graphics (once you remember that anti-aliasing renders everything horribly fuzzy on a VR headset and subsequently turn it off) and pretty decent sound design.Generally the concept is quite unique and the surreal elements were the only thing that made me want to push on despite needing to vomit and rolling my eyes at the 'puzzles' which I think would have been better traded in for some relevant gameplay and thoughtful controls. You want to make me feel immersed? Ditch the silly 'memory game' puzzle and let me pilot the ship rather than simply cutting to the next scene of this walking simulator.The ability to shrink and grow large is quite clever, but somehow managed to steer clear of doing anything useful or gratifying with it. That's why the whole thing feels kind of unfinished, like standing inside a big beautiful animated painting and not much more."

Mainly your progress is blocked by a variety of physical puzzles that will even have you walking up walls and across the ceiling in giant city scapes, There are audio logs to find from the old inhabitants of the city giving some story to the game, and playing cards to find as well.The downside to all this for me is that you will never meet any other characters in the flesh and their are no cut scenes to wonder at, There are parts in the game where you reach different transport but you don't get to see a cut scene or any real time travel, just another loading screen. I wont say about the ending but as with a lot of the game it's a let down and I was hoping for a lot more, It totally screams for a script writer to flesh out the story and give it some jazz, If it was not for the wondrous atmosphere it would be a negative, but as it is I think it's worth $15 for a rather cool experience and a trip to another planet."

If you are looking for a good VR game, this game is not you are looking for. DO NOT TRUST THE TITLE.1. Movement realization is bad. This game does not have teleport system or freemove system (when you point your controller in direction where you want to move and click the trigger) or may be swing arms like you walk… Nope! Forget about this. You have to put your left thumb to circle pad and slide it around to move. Well, I don’t know how describe it, but I hope that you understand.P.S. If you affected by motion sickness do not play this game. Take care of your health.2. In-game interaction is not bad. IT IS REALLY BAD. When you need to push the button, you can't push it, you have to point your controller and click the controller’s trigger. When you need pull the lever, you can't pull it as you used to, you have to point controller and click it! Yeah, like move your mouse coursor to it and click to interact! Do you like to drive car? You will hate it! If you think that, you can actually turn the wheel or maybe pull some levers… Nope! You have to gently push circle pad with your finger and it's more uncomfortable than walking. HUGE DISADVANTAGE!P.S. Sometimes car does crazy flips if you hit an obstacle... ~Hello, motion sickness!~3. This game is boring. It’s corridor style where you can’t turn the wrong way. Puzzles are for children (pull 3 levers in right order). And story… Well, it’s strange and unarticulated. I pushed myself to play at least for 1,5 an hour with thought that “Come on! I was waiting for this game! May be it is not so bad…” I was wrong, IT IS. To be honest, I wanted to drop this game after 20 minutes.4. I got stuck two times in-game. And I had to quit and load to the last checkpoint two more times and spent 10 more minutes to walk and drive the same route.5. Graphics is strange. I set them to maximum with AA and it was like a soap in my eyes. It was so blurred. Then I turned off AA, graphics was ok, but was too sharp with these little edges that cut your eyes. It was very uncomfortable to play.6. The last one… And the worst one. I got short blindness on my left eye in one of the loading screen. Strong light fired in my left eye (the right one was ok), I immediately close my left eye and take off Vive from the head. My left eye is ok now, but it was like the worst VR experience ever.But I should admit game has a strong side. If you like to walk around in post apocalyptical sci-fi world with the voice behind your back who is telling you what to do , you can give this game a chance. It's very atmospheric."

It only took a little over 4 hours to complete, so the game is definetely short, but it looks like there are additional achievements I can go back for with an additional run. The gravity paths do not work well with VR and can cause motion sickness. Driving the buggy was cool, but again, It could cause motion sickness for some. A few bugs here and there, but overall an ok experience."

It should be a gorgeous, amazing place to visit... but it's just so buggy. If you are using Oculus hardware, so much as pressing a button on your Touch controllers will crash the game instantly with a generic ""Fatal Error"". If you give up and just use a standard gamepad you can actually get IN to the game, but right away you'll experience painful, eye-twisting visual artifacts... where a reflection being rendered on one eye isn't being rendered on another. Also, this is very much a ""walking simulator"" style of game with adventure elements... it's ideal for something like the Omni treadmill, but I cannot for the life of me get the game to accept any input other than a standard XBox controller.I wanted to love this, but it's not playable. It's a buggy, crash-ridden mess. Such a bummer."

As an adventure game , don't waste your money or time on this. To get anything done you have to solve a large number of mind-numbingly simple puzzles. The same puzzles repeat throughout the game. A typical puzzle is: can't reach high object; AI says you'll need to grow larger, push grow larger button.; touch object; push grow smaller button to continue on your way. After a short while this becomes extremely boring but I gave it a fair play and got 20% through the game before I gave up on it."

Teleport works fine only with gamepad, so I play with him. I also teleport-walk instead of driving and close eyes during up-down, so I play now without motion sickness.Overall, I like this pretty good looking and relaxing game with puzzles and immersive walking around another planet."

I have not gotten much past the first 20 minutes so I cannot comment on the full game yet, but these devs have been working around the clock and have been super responsive. Looking forward to some Alice head tripping tonight..--------------------------------------------------------I was so excited to pick this game up today when I saw that it was available, as I have been waiting for it excitedly since I first learned about it. Well...Unless I am missing something major here, this game is a total let down for the following reasons:1. Graphics, graphics, graphics.. I have everything turned up to Very high and the game runs smoothly on my GTX 1080, but looks terrible, so terrible in fact that I simply cannot get immersed in the world at all. For $22.49 I was expecting Raw Data level graphics and instead got PS1 level graphics. Sorry devs you really need to do better with your textures and lighting, I know VR can be a difficult beast to tackle, but that is no excuse when you have examples of how to do it properly, again Raw Data comes to mind. Maybe you could try to add a super sampling adjustment as a start?2. Production value: For all the hype I was again expecting almost AAA production value and this misses the mark for me and just does not draw me in.There is one good thing to experience here and that would be the locomotion system, I do love the way they nailed movement and interaction, I wish every dev would take a note of how they did that. Sadly it's not enough to draw me back into Sci-fi wonderland as I had hoped it would be.I really hate to write bad reviews, but as a VR consumer who spends a ton of cash and invests a great deal of time, I really expect a better more polished end product. I literaly shifted my day around to play this game to give you an idea of how excited I was..I will change my review if the developer can fix the graphics issue..****UPDATE**** 3:11 pm 10/27So I decided to try the game in 2D mode after watching a walkthrough video on youtube and the game looks great. I had no idea really that a game could look so bad in VR and look so good on my monitor. That gives me hope that the devs will add supersampling and fix the other issues. I will update my review once the game is fixed.."

Maybe it's better with a controller, I may try that out later, but standing with the Vive you stear with your head and the ONLY direction you can move is forward.  You can't strafe while looking at anything, nor can you even go backwards.   It's kind of exhausting to constantly think to point your face wherever you want to go, and you can't even look at any of the cool stuff without stopping and walking to the edge of your chaparone(that's where the player's collider is, apparently).All the tool tips or prompts are hidden in the far end of the HMD, requiring you to strain your eyes to try and focus on them, though I guess you get used to just kind of using your peripheral on them. These things make me wonder if this was even a VR game from the start.It's kind of intriguing so far, but I've been lead by the hand through the first set of puzzles.  For instance, before I even got to the blocked path, I was told: ""Oh, if you path is blocked, maybe try going up to another level then coming back down another elevator?""  Jee... thanks.  And all the other doors are locked, so I couldn't get lost of I tried.I'm going to put at least another hour into it to see where it goes and will update this review if anything changes, but I'm not sure I can get past the navigation on the Vive."

This game is NOT suited for HTC Vive at all. The developer would have been much better suited to take their time, adapt to VR correctly, then release. It seems to be a PC game adapted for VR and done very very poorly at that. The graphics are way off vistually, they are terrible, which is a dead give away that it isn't a VR build game. The controls are clunky and terrible. The movement of the game is soo bad it is hardly playable. You get stuck on things you shouldn't which aren't even there. You can't walk where you should be able to where there is nothing blocking you. Worst of all where I should have been able to walk I couldn't and then in the engine room when I shrunk, I was able to walk through the ships wall and and go across the otherside through the ships structre. To this I then say all the polygons, the space outside, etc,big bug break in the game. for HTC VIVE I say don't bother and stay away as is. you'll be refunding it pretty quickly."
,Recommended,513320,31889370,Posted: 21 May,all,Ben Plays VR,"I bought this on sale. After almost 6 hours of game play I finally beat it.I enjoyed it overall. But the ending was incredibly anti-climactic for the experience. Details below.--------------------PROSBeautiful environments (in graphics settings, turn up the graphics scaling for better visuals)A fun, casual adventure. Not crazy hard or impossible.Great music and ambience--------------------CONSIt's kinda glitchy. The floor height was always too low beneath my feet, I felt like I was hovering most of the time.Whenever I entered the ""dream states"" the graphical performance became poor. Lot's of stuttering until the dream was over.If you want teleporation as your movement method, you have to decide that in settings BEFORE you start the game. Then you're stuck with the setting you chose. You can't change it mid-game.--------------------You'll be driving a buggy a lot near the beginning of the game, but you'll eventually move past that.Spoilers below:The ending left me really disappointed after playing through the whole game. The narrator basically said ""you didn't do well"" and then it faded to black.It's possible that I made the wrong choice at the end, but the ""moral dilemma"" at the end doesn't make any sense. You're supposed to choose between obeying your orders or letting the city keep its resources. But the city is completely uninhabited! Even the Mad Hatter voice that speaks, asking you to spare the city, is a self-proclaimed AI voice. There are no living beings to worry about in the city, therefore the ""moral dilemma"" has no stakes, and isn't a dilemma at all!I found that confusing, which probably led me to make the incorrect choice at the end. I wish the game provided better closure for you at the end.Anyway, if you find it on sale I think you should try it. Just know that it's a little glitchy, and you need to decide on your movement style at the beginning."

I have no Pros for this title at the time.Save your money untill the issues are worked out (the devs do appear to still be working on this game).
