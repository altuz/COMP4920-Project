76561197995669628,Recommended,513360,30256047,Posted: 1 March,all,Sorokonojka,"Mu Cartographer is a landscape exploration game where you scroll across the screen to find unique places and color skins.It took me about 3 hours to learn how to play but the process was actually very simple. Saying that this game may feel very relaxing or very frustrating. This is one of those games where learning the game is the game, so you should play it blindly to get the full experience.Lack of tutorialIt is pretty clear to me that it lacks a proper tutorial do to the subtext of the game(you are lost). Well technically it teaches you basic controls with blue images but they are not very helpfull. I made a guide for playing the game which you should only you as the last option. It was fun for me to figure out how to play but I can certainly understand that some people hate feeling confused with goals and controls.Story vs SandboxThis is not just a pretty sandbox although I still spend like 10 hours just playing with shapes. The game has a story that is told through text and visuals which should take around 4-5 hours to complete. Yes, there is an actual goal in the game and it is not just pressing buttons. Apparently, it is based on real explorer and I think some of the locations are inspired by it. The ending was a little disappointing for me and I think the developer could have done a lot more with it. My Cartographer is more of artwork than a video game but if you like abstract and atmosphere it is worth trying.Lack of intuitive explorationThis game really looks a lot more complicated than it actually is. I thought that when you in the right area you need to adjust all Knobs until you get the exact combination to find structures (which would be cool). Well it would be near impossible to do that manually because of how precise it is. Instead, all the game ask of you is to follow steps that more or less do it for you.So this whole Elevation thing has little to do with the actual gameplay. You following blue images but not really using landscape in a meaningful way .Immersion/MusicI like the ambient feel of the game . It does feel unique  I will give it that. Playing with the environment can create some pretty combinations of colors so there is some aesthetic value . There are few enjoyable soundtracks but I really wish you could find more music choices around the map .Verdict 8/10Mu Cartographer is a different kind of experience that will appeal to people who enjoy ambiance, abstract and feeling of discovery. I enjoyed it but I can see people getting frustrated because the game does not provide a tutorial on purpose.Unfortunately, this game is about following few steps that don't really require you to look at environment yourself. My biggest problem with the game is just the fact that developer could have done a lot more with it and there should have been a way to get a more satisfying conclusion."

And after playing for a good long while, though I've figured out how to play, I still can't describe what this game is. All I can say is I'mveryhappy I bought it, it's really cool, and I recommend it.Also it's got fantastic music."
76561198140299850,Recommended,513360,27911463,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,foofaraw,"This is a very Q&D (quick and dirty) review of Mu Cartographer. (Because of the sale, true, but not because of the badge.) Unfortunately, I began this game too late for the detail that it so richly deserves (and the game contains, even though this review does not. Yet.) The sale will be ending very soon, and I wish to encourage friends, and others, to consider this game if they are interested in any one of the following:Challenging and complex (but fun, and not ridiculously difficult) puzzles that explain themselves strictly in the context of these unique puzzles and environment. Your mind will (hopefully) adapt to the puzzles.NO hands-on training. The player will, or won’t, understand almost every aspect personally, and love the feeling of each breakthrough. And understanding is progressive and logical.Breathtakingly beautiful music and sounds.Beautiful, yet to be explained alien landscapes to explore….from a distance, using controls that have little connection to the world we know. Color and texture is a huge part of Mu Cartographer.If any of the above may be appealing, this price of $2.49USD for Mu Cartographer is, like the game itself, simply too good to pass up. My friends, Mu Cartographer is one of the really, really good ones (and I won’t even qualify for the badge, even with this review. But YOU will qualify for a really special game!)(SPOILER HINT - If you get a bit stuck near the beginning, there's a pretty big clue in the Store Page trailer.)Thank you."

,Recommended,513360,30268817,Posted: 1 March,all,Khalum,"Very unique game - the biggest drive is figuring out how it actually works.Once you 'get it' it's basically about collecting all the story fragments tolearn what the heck is going on.[edit] I just completed it, apparently it took me 3 hours. Money well spent."
,Not Recommended,513360,30621428,Posted: 19 March,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"There is some charm here, and I do appreciate something fresh, but nah.I only  paid a buck, but even at that price I'm not certain I'd recommend my friends invest any time into this.Mu Cartographeris a game of twisting unlabeled dials and flipping switches to figure out how the mechanics work.It is definitely a journey of discovery. There is a lite story and some neat 'aha' moments, but I think it is drug down by its meticulous and, quite frankly, tedious interface. When it comes to 'lining up symbols', it's just too picky. It could achieve the same end-goal with less demanding precision. I also felt that the 'aha' moments weren't rewarding enough.Why has this title recieved so much praise? I'm not sure.It feels and plays like something the mobile market would eat up and consider 'high art'.Like anApple'App of the Week' or 'Editors Choice' lol. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad per-se, just underwhelming when it comes to the PC indie experimental category.Pros:+Unique gameplay that is a journey of discovery+Lots of cool UI options+Good music+Nice visualsCons:-The gimmick is kind of paper thin-Bogged down by demanding precision required for lining up the graph and symbolsIt's not really about the money, but the hour-and-a-half or so you'll lose - when you could be playing something better."

The top reviews explain it far better than I ever could.Hour and a half in and I only just figured out the last of the instruments at my disposal. Frustrating yet rewarding game experience.Edit: Just finished it. The lack of any sort of reward or closure for completing the game is disappointing. Still, interesting concept that deserves more attention."

It doesn't give you any hints whatsoever, meaning its a sort of highly-experimental puzzle-exploration game. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a fun brain tease. I got stuck at some points, but still managed to complete the whole thing in ~2 hours."
76561197974793790,Recommended,513360,30532079,Posted: 15 March,all,YotsuMD,"It's you and a bunch of weird controls. No explanations. You fiddle around with it...and suddenly it makes sense. You discover things, unlock things, and gradually learn the fate of an expedition to an impossible world. I loved figuring out and exploring things, and recommend the game for anyone wanting to try something different.The open ending left me wanting some closure, however. The nature of the game makes it hard to tell if there's a secret I haven't found to bring the story to a conclusion."

,Recommended,513360,30301429,Posted: 3 March,all,Pogo,"Strange and enjoyable if you like searching for stuff. A ""Jump in with no instructions"" kind of game.Three explorers have left on an expedition to an unknown land. As the player, you use your mysterious instruments to locate points of interest on the ever-changing topographical map. You are given no explanation of what any of your tools actually do, so it's up to you to figure out when and how to use each tool. As you locate these points of interest, you find clues to additional locations as well as diary entries from the explorers.Experimenting with the various tools has a puzzle-solving quality, and there's an ""a-ha"" moment when you realize what you're supposed to be doing. Learning how the game works is the substance here. Using that knowledge to locate your objectives will take some time, but each tool has just enough application that you can exhaust its utility before it gets too grindy and repetitive.My two criticisms:Being able to rearrange the instruments is a nice touch, but it seems unnecessary and it's easy to screw things up when you're trying to learn what the tools actually do.There is no closure at the end. I have achieved all the apparent objectives, but there is nothing to indicate that I've finished. No fadeout, no credits, no exit to menu. This suggests to me that there must still be more to accomplish, but what could there be?At any rate, it's a fun diversion and a nice exploration game.Sangria / 10"

The gameplay is pretty fun and majestic finds. May want to add at least a basic introduction but still farely easy to figure it out after like a half hour.

,Recommended,513360,27747180,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,Annuschka,Probably not for everyone. But if you like to analyze systems this will be pretty rewanding. It's not strictly necessary to really understand what every interface element does. Only downside is you can beat it in a few hours if you solve it systematically (though this might be an upside for some).For me this was a special experience: A game about exploration - and I discovered something that wasn't supposed to be accessible (from the GUI).Bonus Points: Psychedelic colors  & nice music!

As you fiddle around with these and feel generally lost and confused, suddenly a discovery will be made leaving you with a small shard of a hidden story and a key to understanding the controls and world you are faced with.After stumbling upon further discoveries you will notice you handle the game with more certainty than before and are rewarded for this.This is a game that requires you to find all answers for yourself and is a very calming experience while also offering a surprisingly interesting along the way.
