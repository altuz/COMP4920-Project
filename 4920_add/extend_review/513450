,Recommended,513450,30605278,Posted: 18 March,all,Artibius,"PROS:+ FREE+ charming art style+ nice soundtrackCONS:- really short game time- mouse pointer does not disappear- a couple of bugs/glitchesComment:This game looks cute and as a casual platformer it's fun. Both the art style and the soundtrack help you relax while playing. Level design is good although not perfect. Like collecting the tokens seems a bit counter-intuitive, some require you to kill yourself in order to get them. Luckily you only need to pick up each token once. The game might still need a bit of polish. After finishing and collecting all tokens (I got the achievement) it shows me I am missing all 3 tokens on the last level and 1 from the level before the last. Also the hitboxes are inconsistent in some parts, especially against spikes and flames. Overall a nice little indie game that, while flawed, will give you some platforming fun for a little while.------------------------------------------------------------------If you liked this review you can find more on theCurator pageor in myReview Corner."

Certainly, the devs can fit all 12 levels in one screen,3) Adding a short tutorial on what to get (the tokens as it is important for an achievement), how the droplet functions and what to avoid.Overall, this could be one of my free favourite games if its not for the difficultness for I need to repeat certain levels more than 10 times and 4 hours to complete it. Perhaps, I am not good in platformer games.However, you should give it a try and challenge yourself. It can be frustrating but satisfying."

,Recommended,513450,29428428,Posted: 22 January,all,Joliet Jake,"Cute platform with very nice ""hand-drawn"" style.It's short but enough to fully enjoy it. Also, it's not as easy as you might think since like old style platformers, you have only 1 life so when you die, you have to restart the level again. Rinse and repeat until you learn the level by heart.And the game is amazingly for free! :-DPS: kuudos also from some anime references (like Dr.Slump and Saint Seiya!"

This game is an interesting puzzle platformer revolving around a small water droplet's dreams of freedom. During your quest, your drop will take advantage of the 3 states of matter (gas, solid, and liquid) to get through different areas. For example, the cloud form lets your drop fly.I was really impressed by the quality of this title for a free game. The graphics are in a cute, hand-drawn style, almost as if they come straight from the pages of a picture book. The music is well composed, and gives off the feeling of adventure. There are even cute skins you can purchase for your drop using tokens!Overall, I would recommend this game. It has an unmistakable charm, and if it were longer, it could easily pass as a paid title."

Tho some parts of the game I wasn't quite sure where my little drop was dropping. I would give some sort of level info in the beginning of each level. Also the lack of check points made the harder levels really, really frustrating. I think I spent around 25 mins on the last two levels of the total 1h playtime which was enough to end the game. The ending cut scene was also a little disappointing.Pros:- Basic platformer- Nice graphics- Cute characterCons:- Lack of checkpointsI would give this a solid 3/7"

,Not Recommended,513450,29746925,Posted: 6 February,all,LFS | Poop da Woop,"-Gameplay-It's kind of like Super Meat Boy except shorter, easier, and without the frantic moments or the badass feel.  In other words, you'll be cursing in frustration while you struggle through a tedious section, only to sigh with relief upon clearing it instead of feeling like you did something awesome.  Difficulty goes up and down from one level to the next.-Style-High res graphics are nice, hand drawn art style is pleasant, music is unobtrusively generic.  The player character is cutesy, sometimes annoyingly so.  Aside from the squeaky voice work, it's aesthetically enjoyable.-Overall-If you're looking for a free side scroller on the PC, I'd recommend Cave Story or Khimera over this one any day.  They don't look or sound as sharp as Drop Alive, but they're much more fun, creatively nuanced, story driven, immersive, memorable, etc.  The fact that either one of them is free amazes me.  Drop, on the other hand, feels exactly like freeware/shovelware.  Not a turd, but not a gem by any means."

,Recommended,513450,29547314,Posted: 28 January,all,.tomi,"Drop Alive is a plarformer game in which you control a water drop and clear levels in order to get from a house to a pond. The idea is quite simple. Actually, everything about this game is simple, beginning from the visuals, though the music, sound, and controls. The graphics look done by hand, which is quite unique in video games. Only one button for jumping is used alongside the analog/d-pad movement. The game is also not too long, but not too short either. It is simple, but it is this simpliness that is its biggest charm and selling point.Each level is different, which is nice. New elements show up. The game do not bore the player. There are three types of the drop: normal water, steam when heated and ice when frozen. It surprised me at first when the drop turned into steam when it touched a heated metal pipe. I was expecting a far more simple game. It turned out to be better than I expected. There are even small touches like that a sponge sink in the water from the drop!I really liked playing it. It felt like good old times came back, when people made games more for sharing the fun than for the money. It has ‘this thing’ in it than a lot of games today do not have.The biggest problem with Drop Alive are bugs. They destroy the good and fun atmosphere the game brings."

Extremely casual game.
,Recommended,513450,29427398,Posted: 22 January,all,Tejan,"Pro:Cute art style.Relatively relaxing.Pretty fun.Neat mechanic in that your character needs to refill constantly.Cons:The hitbox on your character is constantly changing. This means that some jumps might not work how you remember them due to your hitbox being bigger, or smaller, than it was when last you did something.Going for all the tokens is annoying. Most tokens revolve around insta-death traps and failing to grab them means you need to play the whole level again, but the levels are really easy, so this makes the game a lot less fun.The art style, while really nice to look at, leaves a pretty big issue with most objects have weird angles and slopes on them. There are some areas that look like you should be able to just roll onto them, but you need to jump up and sometimes these are in very inopportune spots.If you're looking for a relaxing hour, or so, of platforming this is a good game to play. I highly recommend that you don't bother with going for all the tokens though as that might end up ruining the game for you."

You start off playing this game thinking it's gonna be a piece of cake but it's deceptive. Like others have said the later stages are quite tricky and it really does remind you of old school platformers. If you screw up you do it again from the start and I think it does the game credit for that tbh. Good game especially for free
