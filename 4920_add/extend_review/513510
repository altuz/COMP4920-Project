,Not Recommended,513510,31278034,Posted: 21 April,all,Finesse,"Look, I want to like this game, I really do.The game feels, incomplete as of writing this. (4/21/2017)This is my opinion of the pros and cons of Intralism coming from an osu! player.Pros:1. Intuitive Controls - If you have ever used a keyboard in your life, the controls are easy to read, WASD or arrow keys, each part of the circle corresponds to one of the buttons.2. Engagement - I felt pretty engaged with the music using the controls, which is probably the most important part of the whole rhythm game genre.3. Community Accessibility - Easy to pull songs from the workshop, very good decision to implement custom maps.All of these are great ingredients for a good rhythm game, but what I had issues with are some of the smaller things the were poorly implemented or missing (?).Cons:1. User Interface - Once you start a song, you are thrown into the game in its purest form. Except theres nothing to tell you how well you're actually doing. I will explain why this is a problem later.2. Feedback - Something that osu does very well is making the player know when they have hit an object. In Intralism there is no such thing, sadly. When objects fall into place they take a little while and then just disappear after a delay (!). No sound to tell you if you hit it and no sound to tell you if you miss one that takes away your precious life points.3. Visibility - It is sometimes difficult to see exactly how many objects should be played in succession, and is very frustrating for me, where I press the buttons somewhat quicker than what the map has, which leads me into my next point.4. Settings - For any kind of rhythm game, the ability to adjust the audio offset so that all players can feel comfortable with the way that they hear the music. I am aware they are putting in some more settings in an update coming up, so I'm keeping this short.The user interface is very important to have for those that want to be competitive when playing the game. On one hand, the game is fitted for the casual player with the checkpoints, and the score for competitive, but the lives are still important for both the casual and the competitive players. This coupled with the fact that there is no feedback when missing a object means that the player is left in the dark regarding their progress."

76561198046247085,Not Recommended,513510,26745406,"Posted: 22 November, 2016",all,BittersweetKat,"Pros:- Good music.  Really one of the most important things.- Good community element with custom maps.  I played more of the custom maps than I did the actual levels.- really fun and engaging.  Despite how insanely hard this is I want to keep going.- Devs have already improved the game based on other feedback and example videos in the store.Cons:- Like others have pointed out, markers are so hard to see in a stack. Maybe there needs to be a difference in colour of the arcs so its visually clearer, or something.  As well as when buttons need to be hit at the same time.- Hard to see when hit/missed as there's no real indiaction as to score/life.  The glowing orb in the middle shrinks, but when you're being pelted by arcs it's really difficult to see what state you're in.  Maybe the orb could change colour (red when in trouble), or some other more obvious visual indication of health?Overall, i think it's a bit hard to play right now to recommend, BUT I'm going to keep checking back for improvements as I really want it to work.  If you like harcore challenges, it might be one to watch."
,Not Recommended,513510,28546712,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,mindways,"*Very* close to being a very good game - and wow, is it lovely -but has a few design/UI problems which mean I can't recommend it:• No immediate feedback when you mis-key. (Critical to a learning-feedback-loop.)• The ""checkpoint"" system is simply cruel: you'll probably re-start with 1 life left, turning the latter portion of a tough song into an irritating restart-fest rather than an engaging challenge.•When you fail or finish a song, you can go back to the main menu... but not to the screen you just came from?!? Click load click click OK now I can pick a different song.This seems to have been fixed. Hooray!I love that there's user-created content; the most fun I had with the game was with some of it - especially one piece that was very challenging but also gave lots of lives. Furious fun trying to keep up with it, which would have been even better if there'd been little explosions every time I mis-keyed.It's too bad there's no adjustable difficulty level, both to accomodate a wider range of gamers (without giving a big ""play the same song 10,000 times to practice"" middle finger to folks who aren't already good at this sort of thing) and so I could hook up my dance pad and play with that (which would be awesome, but is currently entirely infeasible - it'd be way too hard)."
,Not Recommended,513510,33394108,Posted: 8 July,all,LinkSlayer64,"Now, I want to praise this game, more rhythm games need to exist, and I found the music in this excellent.However, I just have some issues with this game to keep me from fully enjoying it,The stacking um, ""pieces"" that represent what you have to press get too hard to tell apart when they go in sequentially. I feel like it could benefit from having sequential pieces having a different color outline, so it makes it fairer to count.Secondly, the delay on the pieces disappearing is too long without any decent feedback. Sometimes (especially in sequential pieces) I end up pressing a button again thinking I haven't gotten it yet.Best of luck to the devs!"

76561198078784788,Recommended,513510,29206709,Posted: 12 January,all,mafalda_157,"Simple and minimalistic, this is a very satisfying rhythm game.The soundtrack is fantastic and the gameplay is suitably challenging (especially on hardcore mode where you can't miss a single note). There are also some little extra things I liked, like random item drops that slightly change the hud's appearance and the multiplayer aspect.But to my surprise my favourite part was actually the editor. I usually never bother making my own levels on games, but Intralism makes it very easy to do so. You basically ""record"" yourself playing the song you want and that's pretty much it! And then maybe play around with some aesthetic/environmental options if you want. Because of this there's a great amount of custom created levels available and that increases the playtime and enjoyment of the game tenfold. I've definitely played more workshop levels than game levels and had just as much fun!At such a low price, you'll certainly get your money's worth if you buy this!"
76561198045435899,Not Recommended,513510,26466318,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,Oranel,"TL;DR: Cannot reccomend in gamestate as of writing, but definitely a game worth keeping up with in time.So I discovered this game while browsing through some of the music games in my queue. I come from OSU mainly, has having played that for more than 5 years. This game caught my eye as something I might enjoy since I played Flash Flash Revolution in browser when I was bored at school.Getting into the game, I'm a fan of the minimalistic look, though the settings are lacking in terms of graphics and resolution, which is a shame because it would be nice to play this game in a window while waiting for a queue or something. I'm sure this will be included in a future update at some point, but for now its a gripe I have.In terms of gameplay, the experience is a little rough around the edges. The actual action is fine, but there is a distinct lack of feedback when you hit a note. It just kinda disapears after staying there a bit (the fact that the note lingers for a bit without any indication as to if you hit it or not can really throw off a player during fast moments in gameplay. Even a simple color change would go a long way here). The notes themselves aren't hard to follow, but a line of them are. Once a few notes in the same side are past a certain point in the screen, its INCREDIBLY difficult to know how many times one needs to press the keys. If there was maybe some contrasting outline to each note that would help differentiate them, the gameplay would be a lot clearer in my opinion (maybe in a skin or something). Additionally, the only indication of when to actually press the keys is the beat of the music. Relying on this alone can be confusing when the beat is not easily defined or if the notes follow an undertone.All in all, theres potential here. As of writing this review, however, I cannot reccoment it. The gameplay is unclear and seemingly clunky. The asthetic is great, but I don't feel like its well suited for the needing of defined input feedback.I'm looking forward to what this game has to offer in future updates."

I don't know until I loose, there are no signs of ""life counter"". Or, Did I hit the note correctly, and if I did, was it on point or a bit early/late? Again, I don't know, I don't have anything like a flashy ""Good"", or ""Super"", or ""Perfect"". I mean every other Rythme game has it, and for an obvious reason.I mean, if I can't see the mistakes I made, how can I improve ? (Plus the wiggling is not a good feedback, it's annoying more than anything).And there are easy solutions, For the first one, just put the number of life in the little circle in the middle. And for the second one, just add the ""Miss"", ""Good"" and ""Perfect"" flashy text in the middle or in a corner."

No lag or anything like that.However, it's just not very fun to play.  And quite frankly, it does not enhance your appreciation of music.  A lot of the times, it seems like the music really has nothing to do with the gameplay.  The fact that you can mess up once and you have to restart the checkpoint, makes listening to a song even more stresfful when you should be enjoying the experience.As far as I can tell, you can't even listen to your own music (maybe they will add this feature in the future).4/10 ... could possibly change my score and recommendation with future updates"

You gotta use Launch Options through Steam properties, and that's not how it's supposed to be. Also, when I try to bind keys for my Xbox 360 controller, it kinda doesn't recognize the controller buttons, so I had to use JoyToKey in order to use my controller.Second, you can't use your own music. I know the music that comes within the game is amazing, but if I can't listen to my own library, 50% of the fun is lost for me. You can actually create a level and uses your own music, but it only supports .ogg music. We are still living the .mp3 age, so I don't think that was a good format decision.And finally, the difficulty!I managed to beat games like Barrier X, after alot of tries, and of course I rage on games like that all the time.But this one starts way too hard, in my opinion.Right at the 20 seconds into a track you will have to press it like 100 times per second, the game says you have limited ""hearts"", but there is no onscreen information of how many times you messed up. So you just end up dying again, and again, and again.The arcs come together in bunches, but how we are supposed to count how many times we gotta press the button, if they blend with each other?It's not a question of ""get good"". I think the game should have settings for casual players, like difficult levels, and/or different layouts for how the arcs appear on the screen, because the way it is at this moment, it's too hard and frustrating.But it stills has potential if they work on this properly. Just saying."

,Recommended,513510,31495278,Posted: 1 May,all,Reinhardt,"Intralism is a face-paced, arcade fashioned rhythm game that may remind some of us of another game.Any osu! Players here?Your basic controls are AWSD, though for two-handed mode, it will include the arrow keys. I have not tried the latter, so my review will not include details on that feature. It’ll take some time to adjust to these keys when playing, and more coordination if you are playing harder maps that have you constantly clicking a streak or more than 1 key at once.As a rhythm game, the player’s goal is to complete a song without fail. If you lean more towards the competitive side, you may even be facing the challenge of reaching the top of the leaderboard too. This is another part of Intralism that I also like, which is how the game appeals to a larger set of audience. Whether you’re a casual player, a competitive player, or even one who likes creating workshop items for the game, Intralism is one that fits the bill in many categories. I, myself, and a casual player and publish maps for the game regularly.The overall design is neat and simple. There are options, setting and other features all available on the menu. When you play, you’ll notice how the environment can change from time to time, depending on the tempo and bpm of the song. This really heightens the players experience, and for me, really did made mefeelthe music. Esepcially with the vibration effects of the centre notes. For workshop items, it could be even more appealing where there is a custom BG, text on screen and other effects to the map. I have yet to use these features on my own workshop maps.Music almost all, if not 100% of the game’s value. The second you start up the game, you are hit with a tune of awesome EDM once you are at the menu. A lot of the default maps are sweet too, with one of my favourite from the set being Flaklypa. Needless to say, not all of the music available will be EDM. Have access to the workshop and you’ll see a whole range of different genres of music made by a small (but growing) community.Surprise, surprise: The game also has Trading Cards, achievements and drops steam items too. What more could this game offer? I enjoyed this game and play it when possible. I strongly recommended to try Intralism, especially at the cheap price it’s at."

,Recommended,513510,30880330,Posted: 1 April,all,Auze,"Intralism is a fun, colorful, and fast-paced game. The premise is simple: arcs will come down from around the screen, and you use your arrow buttons (or WASD) to eliminate those arcs, making sure they don't reach the middle. Let too many reach the middle? You lose, and have to restart (from the latest checkpoint). The best part? They come down in tune with the music. I'll go over the main pros and cons of this game, and then comment on specific features.Pros:Very funFast-pacedGood conceptGreat map-making communityReally engagingDifficult, but not too much soCool devsTrading cardsIn-game skinsCatchy music (it's EDM, so may put some people off the game)Multiplayer supportRuns on potato computersEasy map-making systemCons:Annoying checkpoint systemCommunity made maps aren't often synced up with music wellBasic settings menuHard to see arcs at timesThis game is pretty solid, with some cons, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons. The game is really hard at times, and until you get the hang of the game, the first few “built-in” levels are table-slammingly difficult.GameplayThis game is *mostly* singleplayer, as there aren’t very many players who play this game to host any servers, and none of my friends own this game too. But that’s just theory as I actually don’t have any friends. The 6 included levels start mostly simple, but then get harder and harder as you unlock the next one. The learning curve for this game is quite steep, despite the simple concept. However, once you get the hang of the game, it gets pretty easy.  What’s really good about the singleplayer is the community workshop, which I’ll touch on in the next part.However, despite the strangely difficult gameplay, it has some major flaws. Multiple arcs coming from the same direction at the same time can blend in with each other, causing you to lose lives. Colors from the background, the music visualizer, or the huge, pulsing orb in the middle can sometimes make the arcs hard to see. However, despite these design flaws, the gameplay is fine. Just keep your eyes sharp, and these problems shouldn’t be a big deal. Also, don’t worry about lag, I play on a horrible laptop with integrated graphics, and unless I’m in a custom levels with lots of colors and effects, I maintain a solid 60+ frame rate.CommunityThis game has a very active (and very Russian) map-making community. There are plenty of maps to choose from in the community workshop, and they range from simple and easy levels for beginners (Gorillaz - On Melancholy Hill) to tougher levels for more experienced players (Caravan Palace - Lone Diggers). Most of the maps on the workshop are basic, with just a simple map, and nothing special. This is to be expected as the map-making system is really easy to use, even if you aren’t the best at the game. However, there are many maps (Galantis - No Money) that are simple in gameplay, but have breathtaking effects and colors that must’ve taken many hours to create; hats off to whoever created that level, it’s great.MusicMost of the music in the game is EDM and dance music, with some pop songs. If you are a fan of this type of music, great. You’ll definitely enjoy the game. However, if you’re more of a fan of rock, metal, jazz, or even rap, it’s tough to find levels appealing to your music taste. There are only a few rock songs on there, and even less metal. However, this shouldn’t put you off the game, as even if you’re not the biggest fan of EDM and dance (like me!), you can still thoroughly enjoy the game.MultiplayerI don’t know much about the multiplayer, as I’ve only tried out hosting a server by myself. However, the core multiplayer system seems fun, and if you can get your friends to shell a couple bucks to get this game, you can have a competitive music duel to try to get the highest score (or work together for the Steam achievements). I won’t dwell too long as here, as in my opinion, this is a game that most people play alone.Level editorOne of my favorite parts of the game, the level editor is simple, but still allows you to create awesome levels. Making a level is as simple as hitting “record”, playing a .ogg file (only ogg files are allowed), and pressing the arrow buttons as if you were actually playing. To test the level out, you can just go to “play” on the menu, and select the third category. There are other more complex methods to make your level more custom with effects and colors, but I have no clue how to even start doing something like that. It’s best to consult the “guides” section for that.Overall, this game is really fun, a good time waster, and super engaging. It really gets your heart going, and is incredibly fast-paced. Despite some minor annoying problems that the game has, it’s really easy to see through them and have a great time with Intralism. And for that price tag? Get it. Those 2-3 dollars you spend on this game will translate to many hours of fun gameplay."

However, Intralism was different than other rythm games that I have tried, in its own special way, and I enjoyed every second playing this game.Pros:- A variety of readily available songs to play, excluding those from the workshop.- Great visuals that support gameplay.- Includes a level editor, where you can make your own levels and share them to the worksop.Cons:- Remaining lives are not shown clearly- Poor community level rating system- Level editor lacks flexibility/dull interfaceIntralism is a great game that in my opinion is underrated and deserves more attention. Smooth gameplay, great songs and the availablity of the workshop makes this game worthwhile to play and explore. Higly recommended for players who likes rythm games, or games with good soundtrack overall.7.8/10 - Needs more levels with classical music"

I'm a huge fan / rather good at DDR (Stepmania) and games like Superhexagon so it seemed like something I'd be into.It's... fine. Not really good or bad, and having to choose an up or down vote is hard in itself. Being under development I can only assume it'll get better.The core game loop needs some pizzaz or something. I get that the idea is to make a challenging fail condition but unlike Super Hexagon, there's really no sense of progress or trying to beat yourself - there's no ""just one more game!"" aspect that converts frustration into wanting to play more, so what you're left with is just that frustration (or more likely ambivalence) until you quit the song with a shrug.At a mechanical level, and maybe this was by design, multiples of the same 'note' direction get stacked and lost visually so maybe there's actually three beats in there but you only hit it twice and then one goes through as a srtike against you. What it really means is that you can be feeling totally good about your run and then just sort of fail, seemingly at random.Part two of this is that the 'wrong note' screen shake shudder is seemingly identical to the 'right note' one, so there's no really solid feedback for what you are or aren't doing right / wrong. In a game that's going to make you repeat things constantly in order to evolve and learn your way through them, it's not super great at demonstrating or teaching you those skills.EDIT: this part 3 sentence complained about the vagueness of where you're supposed to hit the notes but an update added a crosshair hitbox thing so that's infinitely better.

,Not Recommended,513510,30122174,Posted: 23 February,all,grape up bitch,"I'm pretty well-adept when it comes to the world of rhythm games, having played them for a good 8 years now with over a dozen completely unique titles in my arsenal. When I got a coupon for Intralism, I decided why the heck not because I thought this might be a nice and unique experience given all of the positivity and credit it's been given from a pretty high amount of ""recommended"" reviews.Let me start off with the only major pro this game has: its intentions are very healthy, and you can tell that the creators REALLY tried to create something fresh and unique with this game. The general idea behind everything doesn't seem to be entirely leeched from any specific game (or number of games) and for that reason, I believe the creators deserve props for their efforts in that regard.However, it really does pain me to say that aside from that one little aspect, Intralism doesn't really have a whole lot going for it that other games don't, and in every single visible case, other games have it going for them much better. Even aside from THAT, Intralism is still very much so, in general, filled with flaws.The first thing is that the ENTIRE ""mapping"" system was so extremely leeched from osu. I'm sure that hundreds of people have noticed that, but I thought it'd be a good idea to say it for the people who only use Steam and have never played/heard of osu before. If you like the custom map creation aspect of Intralism, I recommend you check out osu for the exact same thing just with much stricter map criteria, which results in far higher quality gameplay. That, and osu is just in general a FAR better game.Next, Intralism is absolutely GARBAGE at explaining itself.When you first load up the game, the obvious thing to do is start the tutorial, right? That should always be something game creators focus the MOST attention on once all of the major gameplay dynamics are set in stone and ready to be beta tested. Without the tutorial, you're cutting out a good 90% of the people who came into this game blindly with very little knowledge of rhythm games as a whole. For a small indie game like this, that could damn well be 60-65% of your TOTAL playerbase. Not good, not good at all.However, Intralism doesn't do that very well. The tutorial is absolute trash. Allow me to explain where it goes wrong, and how that branches off onto other problems present within the game.First off, you're given no explanation on WHEN the keys should be pressed to hit the notes on the game screen. The only thing given is, ""press WASD to destroy the incoming notes."" Normally, this would be fine if the intent was that it was common sense to know when to press your keys, ergo; press them at any time, as long as they get destroyed. However, that isn't the case at all, which leads to my second issue.Next, the scoring system isn't explained at ALL. You can literally full combo an entire song without a single miss or misclick, and still come out with a negative score just because you didn't press them ""at the right time."" Which, as I explained above, they never once tell you what the ""right time"" even is.Finally, there's even a bit of misrepresentation here. The game describes its gameplay as ""miss, and you fail."" However, that isn't even the case. You can miss in some songs without failing, can't in others, and everything in-between. There's where the problem arises; you're given absolutely no notification, vision, or idea of what your health in the game is. And this isn't just a HuD problem either; there's NO DISPLAY of health for a specific map at ALL. Not ANYWHERE in the game! The only way you ever know is if someone actually TELLS you how much the map has (only the map creator knows, so if it's not in the description of the map then you're sol), and even then you're going to need to count down every single time you miss/misclick a note just to know how much more health you have to deal with before failing.Truth be told, the HuD itself only features two things outside of gameplay-specific things:1. A very small bar at the bottom to indicate your progress through the song to indicate when it's close to ending.2. Notifications for when you reach a checkpoint.Now, say you learn this game perfectly over time all by yourself. Is it worth recommending then? Personally, I still say no.Although the creators' intents behind this game WERE, indeed, very healthy, it still doesn't really change the fact that there's no reason to play this game all that much.If you're looking for a game that's similar to this, but just of much higher quality, you can find those things with osu!mania and Stepmania. Both of those allow custom map creation, which has led to there being TONS of songs to choose from (probably every single song on Intralism is featured within either of those games as well).Those games also bring to the table more customization. As opposed to on Intralism, if you don't like a map's background or elements of it distract you, you can easily just disable them on osu/Stepmania. On Intralism, guess what, you're screwed. There's also custom skin creation for both of those games as well, which are 100% free as opposed to there being a few available for DLC purchase on Intralism (which, from what others have told me, aren't that good regardless).I appreciate the creators for making this game, but the fact still stands that I don't really see any reason for anyone to play it long-term. If you enjoy the game, that's great, but I personally don't see how multiple other games aren't tons better in comparison simply because they do extremely similar things, just with much higher quality.If you manage to get a coupon to get this game for 50 cents, I recommend grabbing it just to sit on it for an hour for the sake of trading cards. But would I recommend anyone actually play this game? No, not at all, simply because it's not a good game.Final rating: 2.1/10"

It is written in C# on the .NET Framework. The game has also been ported to macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.[1] Its gameplay is based on commercial titles including Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, Elite Beat Agents, Taiko no Tatsujin, beatmania IIDX, O2Jam, and DJMax.Game levels are called beatmaps. In each beatmap, a song will play and different Beats hit elements (hit circles, sliders and spinners) will appear on the play field. Players must use a pointing device to manipulate these elements in time with the playing song's rhythm in order to earn points. The use of a graphics tablet in combination with a keyboard is common in osu!, although some players do use a mouse.""Now basically what this game 'Intralism' is where you press the arrow keys or WASD to hit notes in a certain, direction (so if the note was coming from the top of the screen you would press up on your arrow keys or W for WASD) this game is alot harder and is a rip off of 'osu!' this game does have potential, but i wouldnt recommend it unless you like getting -25054 score because its dumb physics and if you also like missing one 'note' and failing instantly, now im not here to advertise 'osu!' but i just thought i stat it out, that after being a 'osu!' player for quite awhile now that this is a rip off, now anyone reading this is welcome to check out both 'osu!' and 'Intralism' but i assure you'll probably find 'osu!' is more enjoyableSo to conclude my, 'review' don't waste your money on this game, unless you are trying out the free 'osu!' game and want to help support my reasoning for disliking this game, i would personally wait for this to be in a sale if i ever went to got it but i spent my money on it to help you guys out, ;)-Thanks for taking you're time to read this, and I hope I helped some people out"

Note scoring is bad, you get full score for each note as long as it is on the screen, no matter if it's on the judgement line (i feel bad for even calling it as a ""judgement line"", as i said, the circle which indicates the right place where player should hit the note has nothing to do with scoring).It was still fun to play for a few minutes, but after a moment it got boring. I've also tried the map editor to make my own song chart, but I gave up shortly after, because it is quite bad as well; there isn't any BPM sync or snap grid to help syncing notes with music precisely (well, I think lack of BPM meter can be good for not experienced people); also, it is quite hard to read.Pros:+Cheap, especially on sale+Good for time killing+Has editor+Not really bad when not counted as a rhythm gameCons:+Bad scoring system+Editor isn't really great+Not a rhythm gameWell, I suppose if you're looking for a cheap time killer when you have nothing to do then it's fine, but seriously if you want a rhythm game then go somewhere else."

Definitely worth a few hours of your time, especially for the price, especially considering the user created levels and replayability that add to your value for money. The punishing restart system makes it all the more rewarding when you finally get that song finished.What I would say is that the cues can become slightly ambiguous, with a lack of a line to tell when to press instead of relying on the audio - this wouldn't be a problem if the patterns weren't so inconsistent, but it's mostly personal feeling. Track 4 nails the sense of beat for me and it showed that such a line wasn't really necessary, but to me the first few need a little tweaking."

It's beyond infuriating how you can be near the end of a song and have one bad moment, Hit a checkpoint, and then fail with the one miss you had left. You want to restart at the checkpoint? Don't miss again as you still have that one miss. The devs seem very active so I have little doubt they won't implement it.I'd also like a way to turn camera movement off but keep the shake you get when missing a note. I also noticed when finishing a song or backing out of one you get placed at the menu again. Maybe add a return to song selection button?"

I was excited since I like rhythm games and some of my favorite games are rhythm games. Unfortunately, that's not what I got from this. I'll list all the problems I had with Intralism.First off, it isn't really a rhythm game, since there's no rhythm to follow. It's more mashing the WASD buttons with music playing in the background. In fact, I had better luck completing levels with the music muted. That pretty much speaks for itself.Second, the pieces delay on disappearing whenever I hit a button. Sometimes I'd press the same button again worried I missed it when most of the time I didn't.Overall, this was very disappointing. If you're looking for a good rhythm game, I'd look elsewhere.

Let me explain with some sort of a list:Pros:+Awesome OST (in case you like electro)+Pretty simplistic, yet epic visuals+Easy to learn+A lot of levels+Pretty high difficulty+Community levels+Level editor (a really good one)+Tutorial videos+Fair price+Items allowing tons of customisation+Comes in bundle with ""Linea, the game"" and an exclusive item if you own both games+No high requirements, this game will run everywhere+Some hard or secret achievementsCons:-Unclear gameplay-In-game-purchases-Item-drops each require 60 minutes of playtime and cannot be achieved any other way than purchase-So called ""Mistery Item"" which is currently beeing sold for around 105$ on Steam market (is this CS:GO or what?!?)-Level editor uses "".ogg""- format; mp3 is NOT compatible-Hard to master-No display of lives, score or powerups during level-Partially unprecise controls-Unable to listen to the soundtrack while not in game-Some stupid or auto-achievements-Partially bad checkpoint settingSummary:Intralism is a fast, colorful game that requires precise timing and reaction skills to be mastered. The mechanic consists of pressing ""W"", ""A"", ""S"" or ""D"" keys or Arrow-keys at the right moment. All actions that are to take are represented by different colored (for standart it's red) ""Archs"", that means quarter a ring. They show up on one of the sides and you'll have to press the key according to that spot at the moment the obstacle hits the visualizer's layer. By mentioning the visualizer, it's simply a line pulsing in a circle, as seen on the screenshots. All the game looks pretty neat, the best I probably like the menu. As clear as the controls are, this game is an intense challenge to master. The patterns are irregulary, the checkpoints aren't always good and aditionally there is no spot to display your lifes remaining, so you will only notice having lost them once you're dead. That's what disturbed me a little. To name some good arguments, I have to admit that this game is pretty much the best if it's about the OST. Despites beeing unable to listen to it out of your game sessions, it's an insanely sick electro experience. In case you are into Dubstep, EDM or DnB this game is a must have for you. Awesome fact aswell is that you can buy new menu loops on the community market, so you can do with angles and effects. Instead of buying you can hope that you get some epic stuff dropped as a reward for spending 60 minutes within 24 hours at intralism, but ""epic"", a.k.a. rare items are, well, rare and way to overpriced. But the definitive reason I like this game for is: The level editor. Once you have figured out how it works or after you watched the tutorial-clip, there's nothing else to stop you from making awesome levels easily. Ignoring the copyright-disclaimer there are hundrets of levels created all over by the steam community, providing the game an entire new experience.Should you play Intralism?Yes, if you want to spend 2.99$ on a small challenge game with O.K. controls but with epic, minimalistic visuals, SUPER awesome electronic soundtrack and interesting level editor, play it, just now.I won't recommend this in case you want to get this for items or achievements or if you came here for a fun game, which is highly entertaining for both, casual and long-time usage.Otherwise, I see no reason to complain about this game.Final score:3/56/1068/100"

Intralism is unique to it's genre in the fact that it caters to exactly what the player wants. Itcanbe unforgiving and difficult. itcanbe relaxing and laid back.

Whenever you get an incorrect note it just lingers a bit. Maybe the game should add a dark color change for incorrect notes or outside the notes more apparently.

Thankfully, there is a workshop and an ingame editor for infinite amoumt of custom music. However, for where it is, I don't think the price for the game is reasonable. $3 ($0.99 on sale when I bought it) seems absurd for how ""basic"" it is. There are other advanced rhythm games, like osu and Stepmania, where its free to download."

,Recommended,513510,34036442,Posted: 5 August,all,Croof046,"Awesome Rhythm game that rewards you for timing your keystrokes to the beat (Hardcore Mode).If you're finding it a bit challenging, download some easy maps from the workshop, there are hundreds of them!Got your rhythm down and want an extra challenge? There are maps for that too! Some people may consider those maps 'Key Mashing' but put it in to hardcore mode (which does not allow for a single mistake and penalises you for poor timing) and you are forced to play to the music. Multiplayer is mostly dead, but the workshop is very active and Leaderboards in Hardcore mode are challenge enough for what you're paying here.I love it and my kids love it (My 9yr old aced a song on Hardcore today *proud tear*) - playing this game also improved my reaction and timing on games such as 64.0 and Super Hexagon."

,Recommended,513510,34031618,Posted: 4 August,all,Xonah,"WORTH THE $1 PRICE... but... This game feels far too much like an Early Access title.I bought the game for myself and two firends while it is on sale.  I had my eye on this game for a while, however, i never bought it until recently. I'm a huge fan of rhythm games. However, there is so much that this one lacks.First, I will say this game has a tremendous amount of potential. It's the only reason why I'm not refunding the game. (Though i wouldn't get much back anyway). But i feel like the most joy-killing aspect of the game is the lack of difficulty and handicap adjustment. Unlike many games where you can regenerate your health after missing or mispressing notes, you don't get that in this game. Instead you are allowed an annoyingly limited number of mistakes. I'm talking from 5-8. That's something i feel needs to be addressed. Sure maybe I lack skill, but shouldn't I be able to get better while simultaneously enjoying the game? I can't even progress through the first 10 seconds of some songs due to the lack of health regeneration. Perhaps add an easy difficulty that allows us more mistakes? Once we develope the skills needed, we can take on harder difficulties. That's how I found my way around DJ Max, after all.My next point is more opinionated than factual. But I don't get much of a satisfying note comfirmation. The notes don't burst upon catching them. Imagine guitar hero or Rock  Band. Notice how the notes burst and explode when you hit them on time, right? Such a thing doesn't exist in this game. I find the overall layout of the gamelay interface a bit confusing all together.The game is also poorly optimized. I can't even adjust the resolution. The game forces me to lay  in Fullscreen. My laptop heats like a grill while the game is running. Thankfully theres an upcoming update addressing this issue, but its been over four months since this update was announced.I don't want the devs to feel discouraged. I was part of a game that recieved reviews similar to mine and the project was shut down. I don't' feel this game should share the same fate. That's why I'm keeping the game, while hoping that the upcoming update makes this game more fun to play."

Excellent gameplay, as it helps creating decent sync between mind and fingers(as this isn't about analysing but reflection of music keys). Damn good music makes it a better game among the competitors. Definitely a must buy game if you're a music lover and just a arrow key user."
