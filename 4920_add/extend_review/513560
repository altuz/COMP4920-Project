,Not Recommended,513560,29712745,Posted: 5 February,all,sunnytimes | YouTube,"Upon first impression, this game appeared to be a sort of dungeon scroller type game. But once I started playing this game showed it's true colors. A quirky 8-bit styled MOBA that introduce a wide range of characters. Liked the intuitive tutorial, but later found the game to grow a bit stale. What got me the most was that you'll have to pay for the pack to unlock all the different characters instead of earning in-game money to purchase whichever hero you desired.This would work better as a dungeon crawler. With online connectivity to enjoy with local friends or people around the world."

,Not Recommended,513560,29980159,Posted: 17 February,all,Patwag,"From my experience of the game playing as ""Elemental Flux"" for one game:Nobody playsThe bots are terribleThe gameplay is slow and clunky, hunger feature is out of place for this genre, difficult to tell whats going on due to bad / lack of feedback mechanics and finally the item and scroll system is so flawed, it is similar to if dota 2 or league of legends locked most of the items in the store behind account level walls and in the out-of-game store (the one where you buy characters and skins, which by the way are very reasonably priced, maybe even too much so, being $1 each) which seems to be a way of draining your in-game earnt currency (similar to the runes system of league of legends). If you play against another player who has played more of the game (not that anyone is playing) you are at a HUGE disadvantage as they would have numerous items and scrolls that you cannot buy and have no clue what they do.Which reminds me that on the menus the descriptions of each character is so bare bones, no numbers or anything are shown, the character descriptions on this page are about as detailed as they get for this game.Such a small game, which such a small following will likely die rather than become anything of worth."

76561198123536716,Recommended,513560,30024701,Posted: 18 February,all,Ubiquitous,This game is great to play casually during free time. If more people would sit down and play it I think it would very quickly become popular (Atleast until battlerite comes out...If it's good). Overall more stages and game modes need to be added for more people to be stay intrested.

,Recommended,513560,30149308,Posted: 24 February,all,Cremejoghurt,its a really nice game although you can only play the free champs unless you pay for them...not really but you get around 10 DD per match and a new hero costs 1050 i mean it wouldn't even be ok if u didn't have to wait 5 minutes in qeue to find a game...BUT...its REALLY funny to play with friends its fast and overall just enjoyable to play.i wish the developers would lower the costs but besides that i don't really find anything to criticize.nice jobAND PLEASE ADD BETTER CHARACTER DISCRIPTIONS.unless u play them through free week u have no clue what a character can do.i mean take a look at the goblin. it says increased damage for collecting coins. But you do also get movement speed attackspeed and you fire muliple bullets at once. and you dont know that until u play him

76561198079081379,Recommended,513560,29772229,Posted: 7 February,all,Mrrgle the Mediocre,"It is a video game.You can play from a (Currently) limited cast. Most of the characters are kind of bland, but the ones  that stand out to me are ""Ninja Cat that is extremly pathetic and hard to play"" and ""Fat Goblin Merchant that is also extremly pathetic and hard to play."" There is also an Octo Pirate, some sort of Mech, a Samurai, a Orc Knight, some sort of Elemental Flux... Anyway, the game sometimes descripts itself as an MOBA, but it isn't really. It is just weird. But, since it is early in development, I will give it the benefit of the doubt and say it is decent."
