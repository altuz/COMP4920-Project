I had numerous crashes at random times, but nothing that like, locked up my PC.My main gripe with this game is that it seems like such a good game... but why didn't the Dev take the time to get someone who actually reads and writes English to edit the games text?I think I can safely say that this is a big issue with a lot of smaller, over-seas dev-teams. Grammar and spelling are very important because if not, then your audience disconnects from immersion in the story, and that's exactly what a game should avoid doing! Make it a priority!!! Oh and your buddy who ""kinda speaks English"" is not what I mean when I say find a copy editor. Get on some forums and find an native English speaker to help you out! There are a ton of people out there just itching to help with something like this!!So there's quite a bit of real potential as a short experience for this title, it just needs a little love in the Copy Editing department, and maybe some more optimization so that the game is a bit more stable.If these things are changed, I'm definitely switching my recommendation for this game!"

The core gameplay of wooden house consists of bumming around in a house for 20 minutes and picking up keys; you also have to run away from one zombie whose animations are incredibly jagged and spastic. This is an early access game but there is really no where else for it to go from here, you have the house, you have the zombie, you have the keys, and the one puzzle at the last door.

,Not Recommended,513570,31106081,Posted: 12 April,all,Mellow_Online1,"IntroductionI have played 2 of this developer's previous games, those 2 being White Mirror and The Lost Souls, I believed that White Mirror had some good elements going for it but was let down by too many flaws and I feel like, with The Lost Souls, no effort had been made to make it enjoyable. And now we're here with Wooden House, the next horror game by developer GDNomad, and I have to say, this is probably his best work. Whether it's good is still up for question though.GameplayLike GDNomad's previous titles, it's a puzzle horror game, however, I realized that unlike his other titles, these 2 aren't balanced out in this one, but in this game's case that's actually a praise. Throughout the entire game, there is only 1 puzzle, and there is actually a more emphasis on the horror and the horror is done significantly better than in the previous titles.However, is the horror good? No, it still sucks, but I got more scared than I had from the previous games, but I still didn't get many scares. The Lost Souls, I never got a good scare once, White Mirror had 1 good scare, and Wooden House has 2 good scares in it, and both of these scares are near the end of the game. The horror in this game doesn't rely as much on cheap jumpscares but now on trying to create a horror ambiance with its sound, environment, and atmosphere, which actually work in some parts of the game when it comes to its level design. The basement in the 2nd act of the game was pretty good and had me slightly uneasy being in there, and the area in the last part of the game of which you need to try and escape the house had my heart racing at a couple of moments. The 2 primary good focuses of horror come in near the end, which is 2 chase sequences as you're given little notice of these when they're about to occur and it catches you off guard and you even end up having to run back at 1 of them which is quite a heart pounding. However these small glimpses into what a horror game should be consistently filled with, is literally all you get, these 2 moments that are pretty well done, but then are surrounded by an atmosphere which, like these 2 moments, only have slight glimpses and moments of something that could be good but doesn't live up to the rest of the game.In short, the gameplay has glimpses and short spells of something that could be in a good horror game and the game shows some real potential at times but is let down with the rest of the game being slow, uneventful and not scary.Additionally on top of the game not being too scary, since this is a game from GDNomad, expect at times bad grammar, bad spelling which is so bad that you won't be blamed for being confused at times when reading things (puzzles, clues, hints, story) in the game and not understanding what they say.For objectives, the game also just decides to place objects that are necessary to the progression down randomly and with no explanation in an area of the map that you've already been in, which will be confusing that people will have to backtrack to find an object that they need that was literally just spawned in an area they were in previously after just finding out that they need it.StoryThe story is that you have rented an old house out for a while, away from all the noise and stress of the city, however one night, the main character starts hearing voices coming from beneath the house and additionally finds an old book that once opened, releases all evil that is contained within it. It is up to the main character to get rid of this evil or face the fate that is waiting for him.Now, in essence, this would be a good story, but the issue is I had to get the story from the description on the store page. This is because, in the game, the story is so poorly explained and poorly paced that it just seems like it's jumping from one thing to another. Great concept, poor execution.Graphics/SoundUnlike GDNomad's other titles, the graphics aren't actually all that good in Wooden House, with some especially terrible textures in some areas of the house, particularly walls and the majority of the interior of the house. There's no great lighting work shown as in Nomad's other games, in fact, he doesn't take any opportunities to showcase this which is usually a strength of his other titles.The sound also seems to have been downgraded slightly. The music for the chase scenes at the end of the game in the last 2 acts is pretty good, nothing else really stood out to me, the ambience which is promised in the description is just the same old music that Nomad's reused from his other titles, but here it doesn't fit the environment well.Play Time/ReplayabilityWooden House is slightly longer than Nomad's previous games, consisting of 6 chapters, but this only minorly increases the play time and your play time is expected to be around 30-50 minutes. The game offers no replayability and no factors to make you want to play it again, so it's short and gives no reason for you to play it a second time through.Final RecommendationI still believe that Wooden House is the best game I've so far played from GDNomad, but I still don't think it's worth recommending. While the horror elements have improved slightly from the previous elements, these good horror moments aren't consistent enough to really keep horror fans thrilled with their purchase, and while I like that the puzzle focus of the previous 2 games of Nomad's have been toned down to a minimum, it's effectively now been stripped of nearly all of its content for just a minimal increase surrounding it's horror offerings.The story is confusing to follow, and Nomad's bad translations, spelling and grammar doesn't help with following a story that has a good concept and setup, but it overall fails to deliver any form of determination or set an end goal for you, especially for a game that offers minimal help as a feature, it doesn't drive you towards an end goal or have you got a set goal with at least a basis of what to do to give you the freedom to go from there, otherwise if you don't do that, there's not much of a game if this is a feature that you want to incorporate.Graphics and sound have been severely downgraded from Nomad's previous titles, as these were really the only 2 things I gave praises to from his 2 previous entries, so it's disappointing to not get something too appealing to look at or to listen to.The game is also short and offers no reason to the player to go through the game again and replay it through.Pros+ At times, good horror elements+ Good level design+ Good story conceptCons- Minimal attempts at horror- Bad grammar- Badly paced and explained story- Ugly graphics- Bland sound design- Short- No replayabilityMy Steam Curator"

Unfortunately for him every door is locked and as soon as he opens one, he finds out that the previous owner was someone wanting to resurrect the dead using a magical book. Unfortunately the book brings skeletons back to life, which after a while kills him, but he comes back to life also because of the book. All the souls are ticked off that no one can get any rest. Before the skeletons killed him, he wrote down that he needed to destroy the book to finish it. So you go down to the basement to destroy the book, but you can't, because it can't die as it is only a book. With world in crisis, you again get chased by a skeleton this time with a broken leg down a short corridor, and you get out leaving the skeletons to enjoy the book all to themselves, the end.Well at least I think that was what it was, the spelling is so bad it’s hard to decipher what it was. There are bugs and crashes galore throughout the 5 chapters which can be done in about 20 minutes so you will need to save in each chapter. Chapter 4 save is completely bugged, if you get too close to a skeleton on the floor you will die immediately as you spawn in.The developer has a number of games on Steam and not 1 of them has an overall positive rating. This is because he just quickly throws together a rubbish product and sells it on Steam. He often relies on over the top 'super-natural’ tom foolery as a 'tnetennba' to get people curious.Nothing is good here. Story is stupid, Mechanics are a mess, Sound is laughable, Graphics are cheap and nasty. Buying this is like scraping the bottom of the barrel. There's much better champagne worthy titles to pull out of Steam's cellar."

,Not Recommended,513570,31072120,Posted: 10 April,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Review of White Mirror:Here.Out of the seven-title collection that GDNomad has amassed onto Steam in the last three years, Wooden House has to be the worst yet. Released on September 5, 2016, it is a nearly identical, yet condensed, clone to that of White Mirror (released on January 27, 2016). Wooden House is a shameless asset flip that's even more expensive than its predecessor, all the while delivering an even more shallow story in a runtime that's half the longevity.As I made my way to the generator to turn it on during the very first few moments of Wooden House, I couldn't help but think to myself ""I think I've played this game before, maybe I did and refunded it a while ago"", but I hadn't. As I made my way upstairs to lay down, I thought ""maybe I watched a YouTube playthrough of this title"", but I hadn't. While I was tasked with going down to the cellar I wracked my brain and paused, only to look up the developer's other titles, and there it was... White Mirror. Only a few parts of Wooden House aren't taken from the aforementioned prior release, even the end of the game has the same H, J, and K key puzzle, just in a different format.Ripping off one of his other games aside, there's just nothing interesting about Wooden House, not even the one zombie-like monster that slowly shuffles after you in a ""catch me if you can"" sequence. It's drab, boring, and it has obviously been done before. Not to mention, this title does like to crash during its loading screens. Much of the store page is also fabricated: ""Lustrous graphics, allowing you to see in bloody detail."" Sure, they're okay, but they're not AAA quality. ""Enemies that hound you, tracking your every movement."" One enemy, two chase scenes, and it moves slower than a 110 year old woman. I'm also fairly certain that a part of the game was cut, as the store page features a screen cap that is not present within the game itself.Save yourself the hassle of long load times and potential crash issues and just do not purchase Wooden House, even if it's on sale. Don't support developers who enjoy asset flipping, and charging more for essentially the same, shorter game that they've released previously. This one isn't even worth a fun run on a cheesy b-grade horror marathon night.

Easily Visible because I was recording my game play.It would've been a wise investment to have a native English speaker to spellcheck their dialog, because the grammar is an atrocity within itself.As for scares?  You're not going to get any with this game, the monster chase animations are sub-par, and it moves at such a slow pace, and tendency to glitch through doors.  The music associated with the jump scares were redundant and disappointing.The one thing that I loved were the graphics, if you look beyond the poor English and jump scares, there really is a very pretty game under it all.Overall, if you have $3, you can probably get a cheap laugh out of the game, you might even enjoy it, who knows?

It's like one of those low budget horror movies that are so terrible that they end up being a comedy.Let me start with what I liked. I thought the graphics were decent and I kinda liked the chiming sound that would help to sort of guide me through the story so I didn't get too confused about my objectives. When it made sense. Sometiems it would chime and say something that would confuse me even more.The english translation is really bad. So bad that it is challenging to understand what the story is or what exactly is wanted from me. As an example: One of the first tasks is to find a key in a basket down in the basement. The trouble is, there was no basket in the basement. It ended up being in a big metal locker.After experiencing the first chase scene, I learned that the monster could clip through the door that locked it out of the stairway and kill me anyway. Fantastic. Teleporting zombies.I got as far as the puzzle in the fifth chapter before it crashed. And now everytime I go to reload my game it just does a repeat crash to desktop.Bummer, I would have liked to at least finish this game. As it is, I can't really recommend that anybody spend any money on this game when most of the people who have tried it are unable to finish it for one reason or another. Sorry. :("

There's two 'scary' moments, somewhat ruined by the word RUN appearing in the middle of the screen in bold red font (Yeah, there's a zombie after me, I can figure that out for myself, thanks) after which the game throws out its only puzzle before abruptly ending.I'm not expecting a horror epic for £2 from an indie dev, but please try to put a little effort in.
