You are equiped with a boomerang Wrench (Boomerwrench?) and the clock from that amazing movie Clockstoppers (2002). You somehow got stuck in the world of the Fifth Element (1997) and you are desperately trying to get home. Will you make it?Side note: The ""Quit to Desktop"" button doesn't work. That's invalid considering nobody would ever want to quit playing this game!-Casey"
76561198086787906,Not Recommended,513620,32312187,Posted: 10 June,all,Communist Velociraptor,I dont normally write reviews but this game was so bad i'm confused how or why this was released. It has many bugs and glitches. The voice acting is terrible and to top it all off the game can be completed in less than 10 minutes. So to finish here is a list of glitches and bugs i experienced while playing this.1. the back to menu and exit to desktop buttons don't work.2. the spanner would often take a good 20 seconds to return to my hands.3. sometimes i would clearly hit the turrets and the hit wouldnt register.4. every level can be completed by climing a building and jumping making no insentive to actually do anything.5. the level select screen doesn't work since even if you finish the game you can only select the first 2 levels and the first level is a cutscene.6. This isnt a glitch but throwing the wrench feels weak and flimsy and goes like 2 meters which is complete crap because by the time you throw the wrench the enemies have either already killed you or you'll still miss the target.P.S: I spent way to long playing this game because it had so little content i was sure i was missing something that i can no longer refund it.P.P.S: The excuse for a story this game gives is literally here have a wrench and a pocket watch now go ♥♥♥♥ yourself and half of the missions cant even be completed by doing them as your supposed to.P.P.P.S: Seriously just save the money and put it towards buying games that you wont hate after playing for 10 mins like Cluster Truck or Superhot which are basically what this game is trying and failing to be.P.P.P.P.S: Sorry for being so harsh I just really hate this game.

Somewhat challenging and I really like the mechanics, but I like all mechanics in games that have to do with time travel, anyways.The only bad thing I have to say is that there are a very few amount of levels, so you may want to hold off until there are more. But this game is great, can't wait to see what the developer does with it!Oh, another thing. The voice acting is hilariously bad. Sorry, but it's true."

It is worth the asking price if you are into this sort of thing."

76561198056073158,Recommended,513620,28279881,"Posted: 9 December, 2016",all,GryphonTheBard,"When I heard this game was a fusion between Superhot and Clustertruck, I became very excited. While I won't go over everything here, I did make a video on this game, which you should totally check out (winkwinkwinkwinkwinkwinkwink)My Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdcn8YoUJwY&t=314sAnyway, a few key points. (I played this game during the 1.1 update btw)First of all the game is great, so don't let anything I say change that fact. The main issue I found was that cars too often were too difficult to land on. Many times one would become cought on the sides or land on it just to immediately fall off. I understand that the game should be hard and the platforming is key, but it becomes difficult when it's hard to predict how the cars interact with the player and viceversa. Also there's a bug where the wrench just won't throw, as in it'll play the throwing animation as if it hit something even if there was not anything there.I will come back and review again after a few updates have passes, but I like the changes so far, such as the 30% wrench return charge. <3"

Other than that, I bought it for my friend and I and we couldn't get off it until our computers crash... So we took them to the apple store and come home to continue playin it :D. I love it, 10/10.Keep up the great work <3"
,Recommended,513620,28260814,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,buud,Amazing indie game! Judging by the voice acting I believe it was a work of one person. Still has a lot of bugs but its nothing major. Anyway person who made this you did an awesome job and it's definatly challenging and addictive!
,Not Recommended,513620,28298789,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,<OmniStars> OmniTitan,"The concept is great, the execution is terrible.This could be an amazing game if it was just polished a little more. Primarily the counterintuitive movement, if you jump off a moving vehicle (while being carried along by it) you suddenly lose all speed you had as if you just jumped from a stationary position. This one issue caused me to stop playing due to it feeling like the levels were designed with it in mind.....yet it isn't there.I think the concept is amazing and if little issues were fixed I would definitely play it, but even the one jumping issue (that caused me to retry one of the first levels over 20 times) is too major of an issue to ignore.Hope I can one day recomment this, but today I cannot because of its unfinished state."

76561198278662866,Not Recommended,513620,30182247,Posted: 25 February,all,MeeptheSchoolTurtle,"Ok, here is the deal.It is creative, I give it that. I have played bad games, however this is an exception. The game has a music loop that repeats every 10 seconds and is more annoying than GASP's menu screen. The controls are so wonky and and terrible I feel like my atari controls better. The atmosphere it TRIES to give off just doesn't work, as the music doesn't fit in, and all your surroundings are the same. The combat and slow time mechanic is either way too overpowered or just doesn't make sense. You have a boomerang wrench that never came, the lore makes no sense, and the watch doesn't work. (More into that later.) First off, the game is WAY too buggy. I can jump from the top of a building onto another, and then be one with the roof. The turret thingamajigs that for some reason explode at the touch of a frickin wrench, and the terrible parkour is just the beginning. The cars are impossible to jump on, you have to slow down time, and HOPE that you can land on it. I am stuck on the third level because I can't find out where to go, and every time I find the way to go, it bugs out. The watch is unresponive even when I have the bar filled sometimes, and the wrench physics are broken. By this, I mean if you throw the wrench while moving in midair, the wrench will follow you while being thrown. What. I just feel like I got ripped off, paying a buck and 99 cents for this. Don't download it, unless you wanna check if the uninstall button still works."

76561198156035770,Not Recommended,513620,33701678,Posted: 21 July,all,Cloudy,"AESTHETICSI do not care about graphics unless they look awful...this game looks awful. This game is screaming for a style it just looks bad the shadows are awful all the levels look the same they just blur in my mind. The models are really bad they look like Minecraft creations by a 5 year old.The hud is disgusting it looks like something put together in a day by someone who just finished making his first power pint presentation.GAMEPLAYThe level design has the complexity of running in a straight line and freezing time and shooting your wrench when you see a turret... IT NEVER GETS MORE COMPLEX THAN THIS. I can only remember one level that broke up the monotony you had to follow this car and jump on it to beat the level, the problem with this is that you can slow down time, and the car is moving quickly... you see the problem there is no in between the car is either moving so quickly that you lose or so slowly that you get bored.No levels compliment the powers that you have, its almost like you were playing a sonic game but every time you go fast an enemy snipes you and kills you in 1 hit,  THE ONLY OPTION TO WIN IS TO GO VERY SLOW, AND GET VERY BORED, for example: the enemy is almost impossible to beat if you are going quickly because of the travel time of your weapon, but incredibly easy if you slow down time, and bore yourself to death.Another problem is the lack of enemy variety, only 1 type of enemy exists in this game, a turret a stationary 1 hit turret that kills you almost instantly if you are not using your boring time power.SOUNDThe voice acting is terrible it sounds like it was recorded on an iPod and put into the game.The music is so forgettable that I am not even sure that there is any music, and I do not want to check because that means I have to keep playing this game for another minute and thought of doing so makes me gag.CONCLUSIONThis game is not worth the dollar it is asking for, and it fails on every aspect it sets to do if it wanted to be like Superhot it failed, because Superhot is a Puzzle FPS, but the only puzzle in this game is use wrench on turret, because your time powers make it so it is impossible for you to lose any encounter with the 1 enemy type in the game. It fails at being Custertruck because Clustertruck has cars whose movement patterns change the level design in interesting ways other than you were too slow to make it to this point that looks identical too every other thing in this level before this car so you lose.0/5 this game is not early access saying that it should be early access is an insult to early access games like Subnautica, or Dead Cells."
