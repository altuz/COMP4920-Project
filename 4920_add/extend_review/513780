It is a game to play if you just want to relax and play a simple game. If you want an even more chill game, get the original Turbo Pug. The original Turbo Pug is way easier and very calm. Also, this game is on sale basically 24/7, so you can usually get it for $0.49. I definitely recommend this game, it is way worth the 49 cents."

What's not to love?Im a sucker for pixel games and I love pugs so I just had to buy this game.It's a well optimised game with alot of customization. One interesting feature is that each character has different effects, like the super pug has double jump. This adds alot of depth to the game.Now, lets talk about the music. It's probably some of the most emmersive music i've ever heard in a game. The music is feel good and generally puts you in a good mood.The only problem i've had with this game is when you first start playing it will hurt your eyes for a bit and will cause eye strain. After half an hour this should stop though and your eyes should be fine with the fast moving screen.If your considering buying this defintly do! It's only 79p so even if you don't enjoy it theres no harm done!This is a must for pug lovers!"

76561198145808195,Recommended,513780,29594378,Posted: 30 January,all,RaNdOmFerret04,"in turbopug xd you play as the worlds fastest doggo, running at such high velocities that if they run into a wooden crate, they literally disentegrate, but upon contact with water or lava, there is no difference in the sounds therefore breaking my immersion and making me think ""did i run into water or lava"". The god rays in the game help restore my immersion, but once i feel i am becoming immersed again, i die by either water or lava and am forced to contemplate which if the 2 was my demise. all in all i like to be a fast dog, but i like to know which liquid killed me, and my immersion better."

Achievements can be tedious. The most annoying aspect of this game are the minigames. There are two, but to play them you must collect the 10 letters that spell out the game title. The round after you are ramdomly placed in one of the two. Getting oriented to either will waste your first few collections. That is slightly annoying but not a game breaker."

76561198043933101,Recommended,513780,34571386,Posted: 29 August,all,therob,"In this game, you play as a pug (or other unlockable animals) and run and jump over obstacles.   It starts off ""Nintendo hard"" for several hours, but you get better as you continue.  PROTIP: you don't need to double jump nearly as much as you think you do.  If you're good, this game will take about 25 hours to 100%.  One of the achievements depends on how long your pug has run and it will take about 25 hours to do this.  My suggestion is to play the game while you're watching TV or listening to YouTube videos or whathaveyou.Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but there's really only 1 stage and it keeps going endlessly until you crash into something.  Throughout the stage, the placement of obstacles may change so it's not always exactly the same each time you play.  You can also apply other ""skins"" to the level and there are also weather changes and day/night changes in the background.Should you get this game?  I say yes.  It's only 99 cents and sometimes you can find it marked down to 49 cents.  The characters are cute.  However, most people will not 100% this game due to the difficulty."
,Recommended,513780,35134055,Posted: 22 September,all,GlockTheDoor,"Pretty fun! A great game to kill time with, whether it be waiting on friends or sitting around waiting for a larger game to install. One button control which is a nice change of pace (thanks, PUBG). Songs are pretty good. Overall a solid game, especially if you can get it with a discount."
