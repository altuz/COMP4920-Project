An hour of gameplay later and I have to physically force myself away from it in order to get to swordpractice on time (I'm the trainer, for heavens sake!)I haven't played a point and click adventure in almost two decades, but this really got me engaged. The atmosphere created by the artwork and music is superb. The puzzles are logical, but challenging. Huge plus that every single object is historically accurate.Well worth the coin."

76561198261972637,Recommended,513890,29712732,Posted: 5 February,all,Tunnel,"As a big fan of point & click adventure games, I've already played some very decent ones the past couple of months and It's safe to say that The Frostrune is competent enough to make my ""golden collection"" list of the genre. It's one of those games that I know what to expect and have faith that it won't let me down after seeing the screenshots and description (well, it's just a hunch basically).The Frostrune has a beautiful artstyle and it kinda reminds me of Tormentum - Dark Sorrow, which is an amazingly well-crafted game (visually in particular). Apparently, the devs had worked hard to constrcut the environment and build up the atmosphere, laying the foundation for an immersive gaming experience. The majestic soundtrack and voice acting fit in perfectly with the cultural settings of the game as well.As it is pointed out in the description, the story of TF is inspired by Viking myth and is based on historically accurate Norse culture and environments, which reminds me of Year Walk, a similar game based on Swedish mythological lores. However, when it comes to the depth of the story, TF kinda falls short in my opinion. Although it does deliver a Norse epic vibe, I feel that it could have been done better. I'm not saying that the story of the game is dull or lack of effort, what I mean is that I would be happier to see a more dramatic and elaborated one considering that it's completely linear.The puzzles in TF are quite straightforward as they all have their own clues either written or depicted elsewhere, not to mention that there's a hint system in the game at your disposal. I believe you can beat the game without many obstacles by your own wit and be rewarded a specific achievement for your heroic undertaking. Well, I'm not a hero because I usually get lazy and undetermined when there's a walkthrough within reach.To be honest, I was a little hesitant about whether to buy this game or not upon seeing the playtime of a couple of reviewers even it was 10% off at the time. A 2~3 hour experience for almost 10 bucks maybe a little steep if you ask me (considering that Year Walk is about the same length but about half the price), and if you're not a fan of the genre, you'll probably think that it asks for a little too much either. However, after finishing the game, I'm not regret my choice because the effort put in by the devs lives up to the price and I truly had a great time playing it.Overall, The Frostrune is beautiful, intriguing, and enjoyable, highly recommended to those who have an appetite for point & click adventure games."

You didn't get bored and you didn't get stuck in one place for too long, which is just the way it should be (in my opinion).All in all, I really enjoyed this game (and the fact that it's made by Norwegians is also a bonus ;))So if you, like me, love point and click games and Norse mythology, you should definitely buy The Frostrune."

76561197983740996,Recommended,513890,33722243,Posted: 22 July,all,Chane,"The storm hit your longship close to the island. The winds were too forceful to withstand, even for the battle hardened Vikings. Slowly the ship sinks in the cold, dark sea, taking every soul with it, except yours. You are spared. The only living survivor, stranded on the northern shores of an island, that seems to be abandoned by it's inhabitants. What happened?The Frostrune is a point-and-click adventure with an interesting twist. During the course of the adventure you find a magic staff, allowing you to dive into the world of ghosts. The mixture between the real world and the sphere of ghosts offers an interesting experience.The story of 'The Frostrune' is mediocre. It' OK and the game is enjoyable but the main reason you should play this game is the atmosphere. If you like Nordic mythology, Vikings and ghosts, this game is for you. If you don't, you can skip this one. Personally, I enjoyed this very much.Pros:- beautiful graphics, hand-painted- extremely good voice acting, gives you shivers every time a ghost speaks. The language is old Norse. Sounds wonderful to me.- great sound effects- nice music- very strong atmosphere- mysterious- inspired by Viking myth- magical- all objects recreated from archaeological sources, according to the developers- balanced puzzle difficultyNeutral:- short, finished the game in four hours, but it felt longerCons:- a few very stupid achievements. I played this game without caring for achievements. After finishing the game I discovered that you get an achievement for a speed run in 30 minutes. This kind of achievement is completely unnecessary, especially for a quiet game like this."
,Recommended,513890,29656836,Posted: 2 February,all,Griffin,"A clever little puzzle game, just oozing of character.  The setting of the viking era, withouth settling for tired tropes makes it a true gem.  And both art and sound are outstanding.It's not too long, and it is also not frustrating in the way some of these games tend to be.  Recommended as a somewhat short game that does some interesting and clever things inspired by an era that generally only goves us action titles.As a disclaimer, the senior designer is a friend of mine.  Still paid full price, and did not regret it one bit."
76561198011515841,Recommended,513890,30024500,Posted: 18 February,all,LJS67,I enjoyed this game very much.  The scenes were like stepping into paintings.  The soundtrack was beautiful as well.  I don't have a lot of Norse mythology and cultural knowledge so I found the story fascinating and kept my interest.  The challenge level was pretty good.  I found myself reaching for my notebook so I could make note of clues rather than backtrack.I do hope this game does well and we get that sequel that was teased at the end.  I thought this was a lovely game and well worth my time and the price.

Looks gorgeous, and as historically accurate as you could hope to ask for (given the obvious magic bits)Reasonable difficulty: Some of the puzzles require quite a bit of backtracking and experimenting, but most are not too hard. The game gives you hints if you want, but unless you're impatient you probably won't need them: The clues are generally intuitive if you pay attention to the details in the artwork.A map function would have been nice, but the game world isn't big enough for the lack of a map to be an actual problem.Not too short, but would've been enjoyable for at least another hour.Worth it."
,Recommended,513890,29775709,Posted: 7 February,all,Vulpes Fawkes,"Clocking in at just around 2 hours, The Frostrune is a short and stunning Point & Click adventure game set in the mid-late 900s in Norway, in a time where Viking myth is predomenant. I don't pretend to know a lot about Viking mythology, or even Norway for that matter (though I have an interest in Nordic subjects in general) as an American, if I'm being honest. That said, this little game is a stunning achievment in showing just how well sticking to the archaeological record can enhance the experience of story-telling. It definitely - DEFINITELY has it's fantasy elements, but those fantasy elements are in the story-telling, not the visual aspects, which is where this accuracy shines.In terms of the actual plot of the game, it was a very interesting mystery to try to solve, and I found myself eager to learn more. I wanted to know more about everything in the game, which perhaps is it's only ""failing"" - leaving me craving more information. Which, honestly, doesn't feel like a failing to me - I'm sure I'll spend extra time after playing this game doing research on topics relating to the subjects this game presents. Ultimately, I find myself kind of blown away by the rich mythology that the player is presented with, and I'm sure I'll come back to this game many times to experience it all over again.Game-play wise, the visuals can create a little bit of confusion for what is or is not able to be interacted with, but the puzzles are not too hard (minus, for some reason the wolf rune - that tripped me up hard). Visually the game is stunning. Props to the artists, because I wanted to stare at the different locations for several minutes at a time just to take them in.I would absolutely recommend this game for people interested in accurate Nordic/Viking representations based on the archaeological record (aka nerds like me), people interested in vikings in general, and people who like mystery and point & click games.The price tag was a little high to me when I first decided to buy the game, but having finished it I would say that it's worth it."

Worth it?Pro's-Amazing art and beautiful music.- If you know your Nordic culture and mythology (which I do) then you will love the puzzles and story line based on this.- The puzzles are tricky enough to be funbut not frustrating.- The work gone into this by its creator is inspiring and I LOVE the historically accurate Language, homes, beliefs, clothing, tools, weapon (singular) and so on.Rune binding... you know your stuff my friend.Con's- Too short, I need more!- If you do not know your Norse history then puzzles may be hard to follow or understand at times. (Helpful hints are readily available at any time in the menu)- Going back and forth can be tedious, but as the game is not long this does not become unbearable.- not much replayabilityWorth the price? Well Yes and no. I'd happily pay it to support the work that has gone into it, so that I can see the next story it teases (Ormr). But! for the love of the gods please make it longer next time! Its too short for the price, especially if you know nothing about the mythology and have no love of the culture. It would be a waste for those, and may recieve unfair reviews.

They really kept the essencial to avoid overwhelming us with too much story at once, for now they set ""your"" arrival to a new place, and you try to make your way till you begin to understand what happened and what's your fate.PRICE wise, for me it is totally worth it and normal to give 10€ for 4 hours of gameplay.

The Norse theme is what initially got me interested in it, and as a historian who has been immersed in Norse history for nearly a decade, I can attest that every inch of this game is crafted with a love for the culture. Everything is painstakingly historically accurate, and this creates an absolutely beautiful world. I had no previous interest in point and click games initially, but I enjoyed this game fully simply from the art and music. The only negative of this game is that it has an end. Sadly, this end comes far too soon. I'm looking forward to the next product this company puts out, and please, don't change the setting! You've mastered the best one for me at least."

As someone who is very interested in Norse mythology and knows a fair deal about viking culture, I really enjoyed the historically correct details. The game doesn't take a whole lot of time to complete, but as an alternative to going to the movies or out to dinner, playing through Frostrune is well worth the money.Pet peeve: I tried to run the game in Danish since that's my nationality and it seemed appropriate for the theme.

You have to click everywhere to see if objects are interactive (obviously a consquence of being developed on mobile which lacks a hover state) - I don't need to be handheld but completely random object interactivity is not fun.The navigation between scenes seems quite arbitary and it is very hard to tell whether a path/opening will lead to another scene or is just for aesthetic purposes.Don't really get the love-in from other reviewers regarding the art style.
