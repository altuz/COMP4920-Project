,Not Recommended,514240,25987880,"Posted: 11 October, 2016",all,mrfredyt,I bought this thinking it would be a fun game because of the positive reviews...Wow was I wrong. This game made me feel like I was actually having a stroke...at one point i'm pretty sure I smelled burning toast. the movent is extremely shakey and i had to turn my mouse sensitivity almost all the way down just to be able to move. I moved my mouse a fraction of an inch and I end up turning around completely. The game could be scary if you werent so busy getting angry at it.

Also I had a few crashes during loading but no issues at all with the actual gameplay.I can't yet speak for the overall story, but what little I've played is properly scary and I'm excited to see what this game will become. I don't usually recommend early access games, but this one has some real potential and is definitely worth the entry price.If you have any love at all for horror games, check this one out.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZFdtUb2lgw&feature=youtu.be"
76561198207419712,Not Recommended,514240,29860646,Posted: 11 February,all,jesterjfool,"This game was short and frustrating. It wouldn't have been so frustrating if the mouse controls were better, but for some reason, they would basically randomly become sluggish or warp speed. It was nearly impossible to point to an object on the first try. Most objects required several attempts to point at.Furthermore, the game is nearly devoid of story. Without giving spoilers, your character gives a background that he's come to look for his sister in their childhood home where their uncle mistreated him for years. The rest of the story, you uncover through notes your sister has left about the house. Many of her notes don't even make sense... They're written as though she's just musing to herself.Overall, this wouldn't be a bad game if they would just fix the mouse controls, and maybe add a bit more story. For now, though, I can't recommend it."

Why do we move like a someone learning to walk for the first time, only instead of legs, there are stilts? I really tried to keep playing this. I wanted to, even. The graphics are okay, the sound is pretty good, it's creepy. Story is just intriguing enough at the beginning. But the mouse movement is horrifying. Had to turn it off less than an hour in because it was making me so nausous."

The game is so approximately developed - jerky camera movements, extremely rough controls - that it looks like the product is in beta stage.Even the low price point doesn't make it worth in such condition. If the developers clean it up and bring it to a releasable state, then it's likely a good product, but not before."

I did like the atmosphere and the deliberate slow pace and to a degree the story that unfolds.  The puzzle solving was quite minimal and overall this game is a wander around and open up doors investigation.  If the game was free i might give it a slightly positive rating, I might, but for 3 bucks it was meh.  Maybe the VR version would push it up a notch...maybe."
,Recommended,514240,28857628,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,Shjya,"There's the good and the bad to this game.  My reccomendation is pending the developers fixing the HUGE bug with saving advancement data (see below).Pros:- Excellent storyline- Just the right amount fo scares for me- Music/sounds is awesome and sets the tone so well- Just the right amount of search vs storyCons:- Mouse sensitivity is only along x axis.  Y axis will always be too harsh- It runs choppy (this is helped by lowering mouse sensitivity, atleast laterally.)- Takes awhile to load (only the first time, was not a dealbreaker for me)- You can fall off the map and be thrown back into your autosave (upstairs in office, back corner I stepped off the map)- If you get an ending, you MUST START OVER.  And I mean this.  The game does not recognize that you have done the things needed to ""trigger"" the next step.  I know this because I triggered advancement, got an ending and when I reloaded my save I absolutely COULD NOT get it to trigger the next section, no matter what I did (for over an hour).  So I had to start over.  THIS.  Is frusterating.  I will not get the 4th ending because I would have to start all over again to get it (and I made it up until the exact moment of it, but didn't react fast enough).  I am so disappointed at this.  THIS is a dealbreaker for me.  (It might not be for you, the entire game, once known can probably be played in 1 hour- or even less- if rushed)Again, the storyline is amazing.  I loved it, just my kind of game.  But it was so frusterating for me as a ""fan"" to have to start from scratch to try something else when I died.  It's like writers killing off your favorite character in a miniseries.  It is hard to suggest this game, but I think I will, PENDING CORRECTION OF THIS HUGE BUG WITH SAVES.  If they are fixed (see patch notes), then buy it!"

Tried to play on my desktop and 2 laptops.https://youtu.be/EZECEZtiwZYI guess this is a game that from the amount of people that can't play it I can say I'm not ""Alone"" with this issue. The devs are aware and I followed their advice before and after the 1.0.5 update and deleted my old thumbs down rating to allow them time to look into it but after a month no fix so the thumbs down rating is back. Wait for the full release before buying this unless you want to roll the dice on if you are going to be able to play this or not."

76561198059328574,Recommended,514240,25453719,"Posted: 10 September, 2016",all,Ganondorf,"Alone? is a very immersive psychological horror game when you actually scare yourself more than the game itself does. Noises can scare you, lights, shadows, and so on. The story is intriguing and makes us want to get to the end of the game. It sure still has a few bugs, the mouse does not move very well and the running speed is very similar to the running one, which can be furstrating sometimes. There are also many places where we can just fall through the map and die. As a horror game fan, i'd give this one a good 6/10 since it's not so long (approx. 3-4 hours).However, I'd have a small question.**SPOILTER ALERT!!!!!***So I made it to the end of the game where I found the car keys and I have to run from the house. Howver, there is this Abraxas that keeps killing me in the stairs. Even if I can make it past the stairs, I randomly die without even being able to run or see him (I tried staying in a corner and wait, still died without seeing a thing). I also tried watching my back as fast as possible and I try getting my light off/on. Still results in death every time. What can I do at the end?"
76561198307251278,Recommended,514240,25269017,"Posted: 31 August, 2016",all,TiggyTime,"ALONE? hearkens back to those classic psychological horror games where you have to solve many a puzzle while dealing with consistent scares and sounds along the way. For a game that is only priced at $2, it surprisingly offers tons of replayability and versatility, as the game features multiple endings based on the way you play the game. For that reason alone, ALONE?  more than pays for itself. The graphical environment is very pretty for an indie game, the story is intriguing off of the bat, and the atmosphere is genuinely spooky, but I wouldn't go so far to say that this game will give you nightmares with the ""jumpscares"". Still, for the price of admission, it's definitely something to check out if you're a fan of this genre.

So I gave it another go, determined to not like it really based on it locking my computer on a black screen.  So yes I did have to restart the game a few times to progress through it.I've now been sitting at my PC  playing it none stop.  Yes its unpolished.  I have read some reviews stating they had issues with the musical notes. I'm not a musician but the developers have left a note lying around on a table giving us a quick guide to musical notes, so I did infact open the safe, which I grant you is annoying.  I also did not find the paper until after I'd opened the safe (via surfing the internet)My main advice in this game is give it a chance, the storyline does grow and it is very in keeping with the atmosphere, there are no over the top scares but its the subtle ones that will have your mind playing tricks on you.  I don't need to tell you what the game is about, you can read the description for that.  You don't realise it but you are afraid to enter the next room do to the way the game cleverly plays out.  As an early access game I highly recommend it."

It is as if the player is suffering from some sort of head movement seizures.I've seen some reviews about a great story here, and in depth gaming, but where that comes from, I have no idea, and like I said, if all I have to do to die is walk around, open doors, look at things, then get instakilled for no apparent reason, I'm not sure there is a whole hell of a lot else to say other than this:Spend the small pricetag on something better, like toilet paper."
