Get factorio instead.  If you have factorio, and are looking for things like it, this is not it: there's no depth here."
,Not Recommended,514290,30635714,Posted: 20 March,all,dubesor,"Feels unpolished. Maybe should have stayed in Early Access a bit longer.  Tutorial is really bare-boned, I already noticed a lot of lacking things such as I'd like to see processing speed and ratios of each part and I couldn't find them unless they are hidden somewhere. Not being able to adjust import volume is just silly. The sound bugged out, sometimes the machines made noises and sometimes they didn't. I then noticed heavy framedrops randomly and no proper campaign and decided to refund."

This game is so terrible I had to tell other people not to buy it.The problem is that the graphics and the price are rubbish. If you want a good game, get factorio. Only a bit higher in price but way better. This game isn't even a 50p game let alone £6.99. It is way to easy to win and isn't fun. So if you have a brain, please don't buy this game"

The game started on day 30.I started another game and halfway through making plastic bricks, before the bricks were finished, it changed to BB guns, and gave me no research points.I'm always ready to help a developer, but this time I requested a refund.  Possibly in the future, I'll come back to it but now I can not recomend it.Sorry."

However, looking on it now, on its ready status, I feel cheated. It doesn't have any options to customize. For example, i have an azerty keyboard and there is NO way to get it corrected in the game. Granted you can change your system language and that solves the problem butyoushouldn'thavetodothat!!!!!Factorio is a game that's mentioned a lot. But they're right in mentioning it. This is the SECOND time I am burned with an early access game. But that's the risk your taking. This is going in my 'never touch again' folder along with my money wasted.Unfinished. Bugged and boring.If I still could, I would refund but I can't so...Watch youtube let's plays first. Make absolutely sure you know what you're getting."

76561198041550897,Recommended,514290,26565611,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,blueimpb,"For an Early Access game, it's in great shape.  It's basically a much, much better version of Big Pharma.  You'll see people saying it's like Big Pharma + Factorio, and that's true, but it's much closer to Big Pharma than Factorio.The basic layout is identical to Big Pharma: you have some small-ish factories of odd rectangular shapes; you import and export goods at the walls of the factories using special machines; and then inside the factory you route to and from various machines with arms and belts to make products and produce a profit.Like Big Pharma, there's no way for belts to cross each other (like Factorio's underground belts do) so layouts become puzzles.  Also like Big Pharma, you buy your equipment on the market (as opposed to making it, like in Factorio) and money is a constant pressure.It greatly improves on Big Pharma in several ways. Selling to market is easier and less annoying. The machines are a bit smaller relative to the factory so you've got more room to ramp up capacity.  (And, because the market mechanics are nicer, you have more reason to ramp up capacity).  There's much more of a meaningful research progression and research requires actual products rather than money, which makes for more interesting and dense factory designs.Overall -- especially for being early access -- it's a more fun and engaging version of Big Pharma. Looking forward to its evolution."

It could be a different take on Factorio but since the dev is make these really simple mistakes I doubt the game will ever get finished.

Yes you are going to hear alot about how this is a Factorio clone because the conveyour belts and insterters look alike. Thats about as far as it goes from what I have played. But if Factorio and Big Pharma had a baby I guess this could be what it would sorta look like. So far ive only got a couple hours in, would play more but very sleepy and need some rest.But in my couple of hours of play I have really enjoyed it. It is not super easy which I like. I went broke my first time. I like how you can saturate the market and makes the price go down and how you lose points for research if you keep using the same product.If you enjoy planning out lines and actually make a product to sale then this is a good game for you. Which is how I feel it really differs from Factorio. In Factorio you would create things and only use them to create more things. Here you actually create something to sell. Now of course you will have to create some things in order to combine them with other things to create the finished product but you will have a finished product to sale.Cant wait to unlock the storage upgrades and other high tech upgrades to see how it adds to the game.I put a small video on youtube, not my specialty but couldnt find any others for this game.EDIT:After playing for a while I still see the potential in this game. But I feel the layouts are a bit to small to get anything big going. Would be great if there were crossover/ under conveyour belts but the transporter just takes too much research and does not reach far enough for me anyway. But this being early access maybe they will fix this. I would love to see just a big open area to be able to play in or have it so that the areas you can unlock be connected to the starting area."

,Recommended,514290,30697292,Posted: 23 March,all,Tom,"tldr; Game is fun but unpolished, buy it on sale, hoping developers keep updating it throughout the coming monthsThis game is fun and a good time killer, but ultimately unpolished and lacking in some categories. Overall it is a good game, and I recommend that you buy it on sale.Some mechanics of this game are fun to mess around with, especially in the fun-focused sandbox mode, but some of them become a hassle or just plain annoying. For example, arms that grab items from the conveyor belts can only turn 180 degrees to move a product. They should be able to rotate in any direction to enable people to have a well-running factory that looks nice and earns lots of money. However, even in sandbox mode, your factories can end up feeling small and limited because of this game's limited mechanics and factory sizes. While there are many different factory rooms that you can use at the same time, they are all pretty small and oddly shaped.This game can be fun but needs to be updated and changed. It's a good time killer, but not something to keep you hooked for hours on end. Many games have done what this game is trying to do better. With some updates, changes, and tweaks, this game could end up being another big and addictive simulator. For now, just wait to get a good deal on it from a sale. Not worth the current $10 price tag."

It has a lot of great and complicated challenges, but it lacks a few user interface requirements that would make the game easy to play. The tutorial has to be skipped if you don't have a scroll wheel mouse, and in order to clear a room of equipment you have to right click each one- which was murder in my thumb using a laptop trackpad. A tool that lets you lift a large area of equipment similar to the Sim's dump truck tool would make rearranging for new things a lot easier. I also wish there was a way to chute equipment in two directions, but it's possible I just haven't reached that feature in the research yet. Either way it's a lot of fun if you like the challenge of manufacturng and turning a profit!"

This game (although it is early access and may include bugs) is pretty fun, although there is a glitch where the Research takes more than one, but only processes one of the items. This is time wasting and maybe you should add two menus that pop up when a Research takes more than one item to use for Research points. Anyways, good game, keep up the work, and just saying, fix your punctuation and grammer."

A few of the models look the same.You are able to expand to more factories and I would hope you can move materials between them. My one concern is that factorio had danger from aliens, since I doubt this game would have that it may get old after awhile.If you like micro management games and for only 10$ you can't go wrong with this game.I would recommend itif you can't afford Factorio"

The game is based off of factorio, Big Pharma and more and I can say puting those games into one was a really good idea and makes for a really fun game exspecaly if you can't really aford the games its based off of. So far play the game I like how you can retrive the mechinery once you remove it and the genaral game play but I don't like how (well for me) rescherch takes a long time and that the tear 2 products have the same rescherch value as the tear 1 products. This may be a bug or not but my conveyor belts jam up but I think its pretty cool cuz you have to check up on your probuction line.

Ignore the fact that is an $8 gameYes, the correlations to Factorio are obvious. Yes, there is some growth for improvement in the graphics.

Well the game kept crashing. I wrote this reveiew as negative initially and also opened a discussion thread about it. I am not exagerating when I say Kim got back to me within less than a couple of hours and had a fix in beta before the sun set. There is more to this little engineering challenge than meets the eye and just check the negative reviews, those guys didnt even give it a chance. The current community threads are rubbish too, all they embrace is trying to decide what the game is like when actually its completely unique.I started building a few things un-economically and quickly I was losing money, started again and put in some design time and wow now we making stuff, its easy to criticize a game but why dont you show us if you can actually master it.If you like economy latched puzzles, solving problems, design etc, this is an awesome game.

,Recommended,514290,25446960,"Posted: 10 September, 2016",all,KatherineOfSky,"I am writing this review on the first day of the game's release, and will update it as the game evolves.Firstly, the game is VERY early access, for example, it is missing music entirely.  There are sound effects, but no way to control the volume, etc.However, these items are readily acknowledged by the developer, so I'll put aside those known unfinished items and instead focus on reviewing the values of the game:It is clearly inspired by Factorio with a bit of Big Pharma tossed in as well!  Like Big Pharma, the map consists of several large buildings in which you can place your machinery.   One building is available at the start, and additional ones require funds to purchase.To create products, you must first import raw materials, then send them through a production chain via Smelters, Assembly Machines, and finally Product Makers in order to create finished finished goods that can then be sold via the Exporter modules.Of course, the game wouldn't be complete without conveyor belts and Handlers, which transfer goods from machine to machine to belt.There is quite a lot of research, which is purchased with points generated by feeding Research Labs with completed products... the same ones you could be selling!  Each product has a research starting value that goes down every time one is processed... so changing the products that go into the labs is a necessity.Research points are used to unlock further machinery, new product designs, and things like loans and lower interest rates.I really like that this game has an economic component: one is limited by funds to buy machinery, etc.  My first attempt at the game was to build a long assembly line of several smelters, etc. ... and then I ran out of funds before I could buy an Exporter to sell my goods!The game has interested me far more than I anticipated, and I'm glad that there is a new factory-building game on the horizon!This game does need a lot of work, which the developer acknowledges, but they are also asking for player feedback to improve things, etc.  I will delighted to provide that feedback and see where this game goes in the future!I would definitely recommend the game if you are interested in the genre, and want to see how Factory Engineer develops!Check out my Let's Play series here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdiwPCCOWVQ&list=PL4o6UvJIdPNqlSf6unAU2oebvktcE9Uw5"
