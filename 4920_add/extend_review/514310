,Recommended,514310,26529969,"Posted: 10 November, 2016",all,Akka,"The most sexually gratifying game on steamThe cast of top-heavy young ladies from Senran Kagura get together for an Iron Chef tournament (controlled via rhythm game). Arcade mode gives you a brief storyline tailored for each individual character. As a spinoff parody, the plots aren't taken too seriously which works in the game's favor, offering a very relaxed experience.There's three difficulty settings. If you're unfamiliar with rhythm games or otherwise...distracted, then don't worry, you aren't gonna be roadblocked by hilariously challenging levels unless you want to face them specifically. Even better, each arcade campaign is relatively brief. so I can easily see every storyline through to the end!Even so, you'll want to play as precisely as you can. Excellent playing is rewarded with a MOUNTAN of fanservice. The referee, upon tasting your masterpiece, will engage in a fully animated, hilarious cutscene. For example, in the level you give him shaved ice he imagines devouring a literal mountain of it, leaving only two smaller mounds with the red syrup flavoring on the tip of both. The camera zooms out to reveal he's left the shaved ice in the shape of breasts. Amazing.Play well enough and the clothes from the other girl you're competing against just burst off her body! As the match draws to a close you'll see her bare, compromised form planted onto a gigantic plate of chocolate and whipped cream. You read that correctly. On a decisive victory you're given a special view of your opponent covered ONLY in dessert toppings. Sweet.The fanservice doesn't even stop there either!In between rounds you can change your own character's outfit, hair style, accessories--the dressing room in this game makes the one from the original game look smalltime. With so many more clothes and options to play with your favorite girls, you can spend hours dressing them up only to rip their clothes off and fondle their half-naked bodies. You can even pet them on the head! Too hot for Nintendo!If you love anime oppai then this is absolutely a must-buy for you. Nothing is taken too seriously and you can pass through it without much challenge on lower difficulties. Everything in this game was tailored exquisitely around the lewd fanservice. I refuse to pretend I have any shame in indulging myself with this."

This is what you'd get.Senran Kagura: Bon Appetit - Full Course is basically a rhythm game in a similar style as Guitar Hero but with a twist. You're determining the quality of a cooking contest between two anime girls (each of them with generous jiggle physics). There are three rounds per match, the first two pretty much just helps to strip off yours or your opponent's clothes (depending on whose score is lower) while the third determines the victor. The rhythm section is divided into two bars that require the usual timed button presses. I recommend playing with an XBox 360 controller just for easier gameplay.There is no complete nudity in this game. You're limited to only stripping your opponents down to their underwear, which in some cases just means a pair of pasties and very stringy bikinis.There are also some rather...suggestive alternate costumes that the girls can wear, such as a squid that's wrapped around them...yep...you read that right.The game still has much of Senran Kagura's trademark humor, initially starting out with a serious sounding monologue by Hanzo, who's your steriotypical pervy old man with more than enough power he can get away with it. The monologue sounds serious but then he breaks the charade. From what I've played of it, the game is a fairly decent rhythm game. There are unlocks such as voice sets, videos and images, and...lingere for the girls. But it's still a good casual rhythm game if you're looking for one that delivers both cooking and stripping anime babes...again, with the generous jiggle physics."
,Recommended,514310,26525031,"Posted: 10 November, 2016",all,Sham,"This game is still a Vita port, so if you're expecting some PS4 level remaster, you're not getting it for the right reasons.The game is fairly simple in its controls, loaded with fanservice, and has a story that isn't so much of a story as it is the ""Girl's missions"" for the other games padded by a ryhthm minigame that goes from ""So easy grandma can do it"" to ""I bet Korean Starcraft II tournaments are easier than this.""The game has an unlockable/outfit system which you can use and abuse to your libido's limits that works by beating various characters, and story modes to unlock items you can use in the dressing room. On top of that, between each challenge, you can hit the dresisng room immediately to put those cat ears on your ninja of choice.I think the game, personally, is a bit up there in fanservice. It gets really hard to hit the right buttons when giant breasts pop up and take command of the scene, but other than that. If you're into that, great. I got it mostly to know more about Senran Kagura story (lol [no really, I like the ninjas and all but knowing more about a character is plain fun ] ) and sharpen up my rythym skills so I can play other games like STepmania and Crypt of the Necrodancer a bit easier. It seems like a promising way to get better at those as well.tl;dr : It's a ♥♥♥♥♥ comedy. Ask your junk how badly it wants this game, because it's probably going to get its money's worth."

76561198058156743,Recommended,514310,28283489,"Posted: 9 December, 2016",all,Inspector Dosh,"So, we were given a Senran Kagura spin-off and that is a rhythm game about busty highschool girls trying to win some scroll that grants any one wish by having a cook-off. I would have prefered one of the main entries to the series, but I suppose if you have any thoughts of getting this game, I might as well attempt to give this review a bash.First off, this is a PS Vita port so the texture quality is unsurprisingly poor, but otherwise it functions just like what I expect from a PC port with a decent selection of 16:9 resolution options, rebindable keys, volume sliders, and of course, runs at 60fps with no technical issues to point out as far as I can tell. Honestly what surprised me the most was in game looking at the button prompts for each note and it actually gives me keyboard prompts according to what I have bound at the time. Why did it even surprise me in the first place? I guess most Japanese ports usually gives you generic gamepad button prompts forcing you to guess which keys did the developers arbitrarily assigned.There are 3 modes of play which are mostly the same thing, being free mode, arcade mode, and story mode. Free mode is just one song where you pick your waifu and your opponent of choice which determines the song that’s going to be played, while story mode is just picking one character and read through the story with 6 opponents within each playthrough that spans around 30 minutes and the arcade mode is basically the same thing but without the story elements. With that being said, there are only 22 songs in the entire game with 3 levels of difficulty so whether that’s enough variety is entirely up to you.Level completion is a little bit weird in the sense that it’s not based on how well you did percentage wise, but is mostly dependant on a domination meter that’s fairly unforgiving with each song separated into 3 segments with the first 2 segments being completely irrelevant to beating the song. In fact, it is still possible to get an A rank if you nearly flawless the third segment, it’s just that if you don’t bother to try to flawless the entire song, you will miss out on Grandpa Hanzo’s sporadic fantasies and the sexy bonus at the end.I will recommend this game on the mere basis of it being a good PC port and a solid rhythm game to sink a bit of time into, so if you like Senran Kagura and/or you like big anime racks, then this game is a good pick up for you."

,Recommended,514310,29465606,Posted: 24 January,all,つつね,"You don't... You don't REALLY need a review for this, do you? You're here to play a generic rhythm game and stare at animay tiddies. But whatever:SENRAN KAGURA Bon Appetits is a big goofy pile of cutesy Japanese music, subpar port, and low-resolution 3D modelled butts. It's fine if you came here just to play a rhythm game, but if you follow Senran for the plot, you're already gone and I can't help you.On a strictly technical note, the game does have a few issues, like the somewhat frequent lags that throw all the button presses out of sync and greatly niggle my rhythm game tisms. Also, it's a very obvious port, and I hope you have a gamepad, otherwise navigating some of the menus, like the dressing room (You knew it was there), is a complete cast-iron motherfu­cker of an ordeal.I'd probably give the game a 4/5, and does an overall good job of being your typical rhythm game with a heaping helping of Plot."

,Recommended,514310,33102720,Posted: 1 July,all,ウルトラ先輩,"As this is a Senran Kagura game, I already knew I was going to love the game, and wondered to myself what I was getting myself into. But I found Senran Kagura Bon Appetit to be a really fun rhythm game. There is a wide array of characters you can select from (aka the roster from Shinovi Versus), so you can enjoy cook-offs with your favorite against everyone else. There are three main modes in Bon Appetit: Story Mode, Arcade Mode, and Free Mode.The story in this game involves a cook-off competition, with the prize being a Secret Ninja Scroll that can grant its user any wish that she may desire. It works the same way as it did in the previous entries: Shinovi Girls' Hearts stories. You play through each characters' stories and find out what they wanted. I really enjoyed playing most of their stories because some are quite hilarious.The songs that you play depend on who your opponent is, which I think is fine both in Story and Arcade Modes; but I wish that you could pick whichever song you wanted to play in Free Play. But I understand that the songs are to match each of the characters. Some of the songs in this game are good, and some are mediocre. For the mediocre ones, they were pleasant to listen to, but not fun to play because those songs tend to be the somewhat slow songs; and I gotta go fast.Gameplay-wise, it's fun for a rhythm game, just simply press the corresponding button or key at the right time to get the most out of it, and activate Ninja Arts for maximum power. The little ""specials"" that occur during a song is distracting if you're someone like me who takes getting perfect scores seriously, but this is Senran Kagura, and we should always expect stuff like that.The Dressing Room and the Library remain, and operate the same way as the main titles; and everything is unlocked simply by playing the game (there's no store like in the previous titles). If there is one big thing that I would have to complain about the most, it's that there's no multiplayer functionality. This should've been a feature because I want to play online against my friends and against other people around the globe. The only online feature available in the game is Leaderboards.But overall, I recommend Senran Kagura Bon Appetit to people who like rhythm games and can deal with the theme of Senran Kagura, but I definitely recommend this game to any Senran Kagura fan.

Fun.Pros/Cons:+ Great music.  It's very catchy and likeable.  Given the replayability of the game, this is a really good thing.+ It's a bit like guitar hero in that the button presses follow the melody of the music.  It's not simply metronomic.+ The animations are pretty cool-- the characters will actually stir pots or spin cotton candy or stare at a microwave depending on the dish being made.+ The judge is hilarious.+ The game does not take itself seriously and has some pretty silly plotlines.+ The customization system is great.  There are a huge number of costumes-- not just simple recolors either.  There's also accessories that are entirely adjustable in terms of position and size.  That means you can stick a giant lollipop on someone's head or make their entire upper half a giant trout... or something more sensible, I guess.+ The notes line up nicely with the music.  It's very satisfying.+ Hard mode is challenging yet not overwhelming-- not a crazy mess of button mashing like some rhythm games.+ It took me roughly 24 hours to get all the achievements.  Given the replayable nature of a rhythm game, I'd say the price is very worth it.-Personally, I had a lot of trouble getting this game to run properly until I checked the discussions for a solution.  When I first booted it up, the framerate was very stuttery.  It was unplayable.- Some songs are unproportionately difficult compared to others.  They're challenging even on normal difficulty.- The songs are played in three segments, each being a different dish.  My issue is that, to pass a song, the first two segments don't matter in the slightest.  One can literally put their controllers down and fail the first two parts and still be able to win.  Alternatively, they could ace the first two sections then lose because they lost the last part.  It doesn't make much sense.- Some of the costumes for larger characters don't scale well for smaller characters making them look sorta nightmarish and odd.Overall:I really love this game.  It's one of the best rhythm games I've played on steam. It reminds me of guitar hero, and I absolutely love that about it.  While it certainly has heaps of fan service and rather... pneumatic characters, that is not what drew me to it.  As a huge fan of rhythm games, I have to say that this game is, well, really fun.  It's got good art, animations, and character customization.  Despite my troubles in running it, I have certainly enjoyed my time with it.  I recommend it to any fan of the more guitar hero-esque rhythm games."
,Recommended,514310,30914955,Posted: 2 April,all,Holy Toast,"~Ooh-La-La~Senran Kagura Bon Appétit is a foray by XSeed and Marvelous into a new genre for the game series. Bon Appétit can best be described as a rhythm game much in the same vein as Guitar Hero. You play as one of the Hanzo/Gessen/Hebijo/Crimson Squad girls who is cooking and competing against a fellow Shinobi. Your goal is to maintain your rhythm with the songs and make amazing dishes. The game features the same wild antics that are present in Shinovi and Estival, while also treating us to some comedy + saucy gold.Positives+ Some rocking songs! - There are some really catchy songs here that are worth your listening.+ Laugh out loud moments - Comedy gold here folks. Especially the Hanzo interjections.+ Fanservice galore - Bon Appétit doesn't hold back on what it's known for.+ Some replayability - Easy/Medium/Hard difficulty help keep the game from stagnating.Negatives- Limited number of songs! - Only 22 songs. Eventually gets to be repetetive over a long period of time.- Difficulty Restrictions - Normal feels too easy... Hard feels way too difficult for me. Can leave you stuck.- Aged graphics - Character sprites are not the smoothest... some cut-off edges on curves.In any case, I enjoyed Bon Appétit for everything it provided. Go ahead and purchase it at full price if you're an avid fan. If you're in any way unsure, I'd suggest waiting for a discount."

I call that a win win, Why? More food to eat and a hot girl for your viewing pleasure. (I just sounded like a total pervert, but hey that's what it basically is for the player (゜▽゜;) )All and all its a pretty fun game that actually pushes your limits in some of the matches, heck its even hard for me once I reach the final stage. I give this game a 7/10."

Because it is HEAVY here.  And of course, it's a Senran Kagura game, so clothes will be flying off the girls, with the usual censorship.That being said, this is a rhythm game, where you press the scrolling buttons as they appear.  Being set in the Senran Kagura universe, this game is about a nonsense food tournament where the girls compete against each other to attain a scroll that would grant whatever wish they so desire.  Why would such a powerful item be up for grabs in a mere cook-off?  Because this is silly.  Heck, the game says so itself.Each 'match' has three stages.  Whoever has the upper hand in each stage, the losing girl has parts of their clothes blasted off.  I think you know where this goes.  Especially when you perfect a girl.  Perfecting gives you a scene where the losing girl is 'served' with fruit as a dessert, wearing nothing but chocolate and whipped cream in certain places.  And then you can perv on them.  And since this is a SK game, you are able to unlock outfits and dress up the girls however you see fit.  Want to make them all wear the same outfit?  Go for it.  Make them wear as least as possible so that the clothes being torn off doens't really matter?  Whatever floats your boat.The music is pretty good, as it has to be in a rhythm game.  In my opinion, the best one is Miyabi's, ""Machiavellism of Despair.""  Seriously, go look that one up.There are differences in the difficulties, with easy being simple, but the other ones have you doing complex combinations.    This rhythm game has two tracks of scrolling buttons for you to... well, keep track of, requiring you to be really good at multitasking.  You got basic stuff.  Press button, mash button, hold button, etc.  It doesn't take long to understand.Since it's a silly premise, the story is pretty non-existant here, just the girls wanting to fulfil their desires being the driving force.For the price, this isn't too bad.  If you're a Senran Kagura fan, you'll probably pick it up.  If you're a fan of rhythm games, it might appeal to you.  If you're a perv, you already bought the game.You could do a lot worse for thirty dollars."

Impressions below based off the Vita version.It's a rhythm game, and I daresay it's better at being a rhythm game than every other Senran Kagura game is at beating a fighting game. The songs are all essentially the same sorts of energetic, bouncy video game music tracks you had in SKSV's strong soundtrack, so if you're expecting to get some Hatsune Miku variety you will be disappointed. Each girl has their own song, so which song you play is decided by the opponent you pick. If you are clearing story modes, this means you will be repeating songs by necessity.But the fundamentals are strong. The dopey Senran stories from SKSV are ramped up to 10 in ridiculousness here. If you wanted to know what lay ahead for Yumi after she learned what justice truly was in SKSV, this is surely your game.Naturally, the dressing room, clothes getting blasted off, and the bounciness you have come to expect from SK is all still here.Fair warning: Hard is pretty hard and even ignoring the distractions up above, the note track isn't the easiest to read. Also Daidoji and Rin's songs are about twice as hard as anyone else's so if you rush straight for them be wary."

I grabbed it because I generally enjoy rhythm games and this sat on the top of the charts for a bit, I was also surprised and shocked at how much I enjoyed the previous beat-em-up from the same franchise.  My opinion of this one is a little more tepid.  I sat for a while wondering what it is about this game I don't like but other rhythm games have and in short-it's the funk and soul I see in the others I don't see here.First, the rhythm portion uses controller button presses to manage beats in time with a song.  If you've played any rhythm game since amplitude, the controls are immediately familiar.  The taps fall in time with the song playing in the background and the gameplay is familiar, if copied, from previous generations.  Not necessarilly a bad thing.The songs however, are mostly jpop even when the tracks try to switch to a different genre the jpop remains familiar in the background.  This is a preference thing, you may enjoy jpop a lot, I like japanese folk music more and that will tell you how aged my preferences in japanese music are.What is happening is well, anime girls with big gainax boobies take a break from beating each other up to competing in a cooking competition.  Some strange old guy judges.  His reactions to the winning dish can include, at its most extreme, growing a large pair of big gainax anime boobies himself.  He then blasts the clothing off of the losing contestant with his mouth laser.  It sounds like a twisted mix which came out of Japanese games like D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die.  Incedentally, it comes off as being just strange and not strange and amusing.The combination of cooking, titilation, and rhythm comes off as a bit off-putting and unusual as in it probably doesn't work well together.  It's like if that old Stephen Chow flick ""God of Cookery"" got mixed together with jpop and anime boobies, it sounds wierd enough to be enjoyable but something seems a bit off.I like rhythm games enough to open it and slog through a bit more every now and again but even with what's available on steam, there are better alternatives and maybe this one should be passed."

The player even has access to a power up that evens the odds if they hit enough notes. On normal difficulty, there were only a couple of songs that took me a couple of tries to perfect.Aside from that, Bon Appetit is worth checking out if you're a fan of fanservice or just the absurdity that is the Senran Kagura series.

Mostly Jpop, but also has some hints of traditional Japanese music in them.+ Very nice, solid framerate. I have a really crappy computer, but even on the highest settings my computer only hiccups when I take screenshots and when there's a LOT going on on screen (at that point it drops to around 40 fps, but the audio doesn't slug so keeping a steady rhythm isn't hard at all.)+ Amusing stories. Keeps the humourous tone throughout the whole game unlike Shinovi. Not that I found that to be a problem, but, given this game's specific mechanics, it wouldn't fit very well if it were otherwise.+ Responsive buttons; no input lag.+ Massive anime boobs (and one loli for the degenerates.)+ You can still molest the girls in the dressing room.+ Murasaki.CONS:- This could just be my computer, but there are a lot of graphical glitches in the background of my game. A lot of the background turns black for some reason.- Repetitive gameplay with no variety. (Aside from the music itself.)- No multiplayer. Can't rekt my friends in a rhythm game with giant anime tiddies.- Stories are really short. Only 3 character interactions (and 2 randomly selected characters) then you're done with that character.- Learning curve is pretty steep in my opinion. For context, in Normal mode, I lost to Rin 7 times before I got past her in Ryona's story, but I full combo'd Minori's song first try, without having heard it beforehand. Take that as you will.- No way to view your gameplay over unless you manually record it, so you can't see Murasaki shaking her booty at you because you have to focus on the buttons so hard :(- Rin's song.

Even in the easiest mode there is still some challenge to be had and with every charater you face having different levels of difficulty to their beats, it allows you a clever way to try and predict how hard earned your victory might be. I will be perfecty honest though, all the characters are basicallly stereotypes and are played more for humour than actual relatability, but the ""special reward"" you get for having these characters duel is not dissapointing."

It should be said that this game is DEFINITELY more for people who are already fans of the Senran Kagura games than hardcore rhythm game fans; BUT if you like rhythm games and dig gloriuosly gratuitious T&A, then you may very well enjoy this too.There are some frame drops here and there when the cooking gets more intensive, but the visuals are a very nice upgrade from the Vita nonetheless. Gameplay is pretty simple just hit the corresponding buttons when they land on the point like most any other rhythm game. I'd recommend a controller, but you could probaly do fine with a keyboard.The main issue I have with this game is the difficulty spikes it has. While the majority of songs on easy/normal/hard are relatively respective to those difficulties, there are five or six that are absurdly more difficult or absurdly easier than they should be for their difficulty class. I speak in particular about the difficulty spikes in Rin and Daidouji's songs. When on Easy, those songs feel more like they should be on Medium. On Medium, they feel like they're more suited for Hard, and on Hard they're just pure hell. This is really the only REAL issue, I believe.Overall, coming from someone who's a fan of the Senran Kagura series, it's fairly solid. It's not the most amazing game ever by any means, but it does what it does well-enough."
