When I first read the Negative reviews, I laughed at them, and then went ahead and bought the game.OMG - People ... Believe Every Word that Karahan and others have written here.  This 99¢ game is a waste of good money!  No, really - 5 minutes into the game I was bored stiff.  2/10 only because movement in-game on skateboard was really smooth & looked good, although I couldn't stand the actual gameplay - oh well.A word to the wise - don't make the same mistake. Cheers  (# of hours reflects game running overnight for card drops FYI)"
,Not Recommended,514660,29288719,Posted: 15 January,all,WidescreenRules,"I really hate to be a Negative Nancy on this. The idea behind it is fine, but the sad reality is that after a (short) while, the game becomes boring as hell. Yes, there are unlockable characters, but honestly I was not able to figure out how to unlock them. I was 1 out of 5 on my way to the second character but I have no idea what that 1 item was to get me there. And the map is the same thing over and over and over and over again.It's definitely bright and colorful and the difficulty level does ramp up quite well; but with the same level repeated ad nauseum, the fun was soaked out of it. I respect the opinion of those who enjoyed it. Maybe it takes a certain attitude towards these games to enjoy them. If that's the case, I'm clearly not in the target audience for the game as of the time that I write this.Maybe future changes and updates will cause me to take a second look; but as it stands right now, this game is fun for a very short amount of time and then becomes stale and boring very quickly."

Not being able to even toggle sounds or music is a big red flag from the start. No instructions or ideas of what is happening in game, for instance there is a random debuff the game puts that drains your health constantly until you die, no idea why or how to make it stop. I tried to give it a shot but when I finally passed the first stage I got to the boss whose attacks are completely unavoidable. When a game doesn't give you a chance to survive and no idea how to do learn from it, it makes it a bad experience. Really bad game."

,Recommended,514660,31677857,Posted: 10 May,all,jkrevo,"Not the best twin-stick shooter, but it's plenty worth the $3 or less.Several weapons with plenty of variation and upgrade levels.Has some unique gameplay elements in the form of area-wide modifiers that can be either positive or negative.Once you get the hang of navigating the map and figuring out which modifiers to look for, you can easily get into a nice groove and blast through each wave rather easily.However, the bossesaretough. (FYI-not a bad thing)"

Only issue I've had with it so far is that the bosses are reaaaaaally hard to beat. Or I just suck at these kind of games. Yeah, it's probably that."

,Recommended,514660,26048974,"Posted: 15 October, 2016",all,djspade,"Well, just started playing it.The controls were a bit strange to start... I couldn't figure out how to keep moving.  I was holding the controller in the direction I wanted to go... then finally discovered that you have to keep constantly pressing the direction you want to go when you start to slow down on your board... which is a bit odd for a twin-stick game.Then I can't figure out why sometimes I am getting hit by the lines going around the screen.  I don't know what is setting them off to be dangerous to the character.  Most of the time they don't do anything but sometimes they hurt you and I'm not sure what causes that.Anyways, once you get the hang of those controls it is a decent game, since I only paid 92 cents, can't complain!"

I mentioned it to the developer and hope the mouse could be locked in screen.  Other than that it is a really neat game and only for a dollar?

,Recommended,514660,26099284,"Posted: 18 October, 2016",all,Tom and Sue,"Seems like a solid game, could use some more ways of progression, since currently all I could do to ""upgrade"" my weapons was to pick up the bonuses that spawn every wave, and all they seemed to do was either increase the amount of projectiles fired from one of the 4 weapons, increase the size of the projectiles or just give the weapon a damage boost, which didn't really seem to affect the guns performance much.Now, there are 4 weapons as I mentioned before, your standard blaster, which from upgrades receives extra projectiles.The second weapon I'd best describe as a curved (banana shaped) projectile, that at higher levels grows bigger, and passes through a few enemies.The third weapon seems like a rocket launcher of sorts, but the explosion barely deals any AoE, even at level 9.The fourth weapon was one of my favorites, along with the 2nd weapon, this one shoots sort of like, mini rockets, that deal no AoE, but with levels you get more projectiles. The reason I'd describe the projectiles as mini rockets, is because they're angular & slower than the other projectiles.after wave 20, you get a boss fight, and after beating the boss, you get to choose between four (presumably) random perks.after choosing your perk, you're thrown back in to the arena where you started, just now there's more enemies spawning & the walls have moved a bit.after reaching wave 36 or so, I got killed.That's about as far as I've made it as of now, I do intend to play the game some more, just to see what the other characters do & if they have any differences.To unlock a second character you need 15.. let's just call them crystals.. I've got no idea on what criteria I'm awarded crystals, but after three runs of the game, I've gained 8 of them.The game claims to have controller support, but it didn't seem to recognize my xbox one controller, nor does it have rebindable keys.I had no issues with the keyboard layout that the game uses, except for the odd choice of putting a specific perk (bomb I believe it was called) seemed to be bound to z and 5.. you change your weapons by pressing Q,E,1-4 or right clicking, or scrolling your mouse wheel.. but using a perk (that you might get after wave 20) is bound awkwardly to 2 buttons that aren't easily reachable, especially when your left hand is already stuck on WASD.all in all, a very good game for its pricepoint, hope they add more content in the future & fix the keybindings & controller support.p.s. who binds shooting to the bumpers and toggling weapons to the triggers?"

The pictures and videos shown are very accurate. Does it get a little repetitive? Yes and it makes unlocking characters a bit of a pain but even if you pick up and play this game for 20 min a day, you can still see the progress from round to round and it has kept me coming back."
