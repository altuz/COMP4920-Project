,Not Recommended,514670,28431596,"Posted: 17 December, 2016",all,kessusagi,I really want to like this game but the delivery of the game mechanics make it hard to like.So here are some pros and cons.Pros-clean UI-pretty-low system requirement's-no need to understand physics in spaceCons-Poor tutorial that doesn't explain how to use the tools provided.-RNG isnt tied to a difficulty curve so you get impossible missions right at the start of the game.-doesn't matter how much you understand  physics in space.-feels like a poor mobile port with little done to adapt to PC.I love KSP and understand physics in space along with orbits but the user interface in this game is what I'm having problems with. It feels like the developers wanted to stream line everything to give it a clean appearance but fails to clearify how the user interacts with the tools provided. The tutorial just says look at these icons and fails to explain how to use them.I personally dont like difficulty from frustration and a good example of this is getting a deorbit mission that is impossible to complete right out of the gate. The game loaded up a deorbit mission and the object had almost the exact same orbit as my default satillite but on the opposite side of earth so no line of sight could be made. Then to add insult to injury my satillite went into hibration mode and didn't want to wake up thus failing 6 more missions and failing the game. How is that fair? Did I just get a really bad random number generator 5 new games in a row and if this is the case why not have a default mission or two as a tutorial that is possible.Unforgiving gameplay should be tied to skill and understanding of the game mechanics not used as an excuse for RNG without parameters or difficulty curve.As stated at the top I really wanted to like this game but as it is I can't recomment this game in its current state.I have taken my own advice and refunded the game because I haven't had any joy playing it.

Certainly not justifiable of a £7 price tag - should be £1.49 like it's mobile Ctrl+C.At first glance, gameplay may seem in-depth, but it is not - merely tracking an object, using a tool, waiting until a resource is critical, resolve said resource, repeat."

Don't expect KSP2, its really what the Name of the Game suggest. You command Satellites, can start new, deorbit old, and you get contracts, so you can earn money to extend your possibilities by research. Earth-only, some science-facts around for some contracts, nothing too spectacular. got 28 achievements in my 22h-game (while reading a book meanwhile), the others are too much of a grind imho. but for the price (sale), it was ok. better than many other ""indie""-games."
,Not Recommended,514670,30022206,Posted: 18 February,all,Magnetom,"This game had a very good idea, but a very poor execution. It's by all means functional and playable, but actually how much enjoyment can you get from this game? Every satellite looks the same, theres no different cosmetic changes or anything except for the icon colors from the map portion. Every mission in essence is the same exact things, either with different tools or locations where you have to painstakingly change your satellite's orbit or launch a new one. You can research upgrades that give your satellites a little more longevity. In the end, it's pretty repetative and offers very little in the way of goals. Is it worth its price? Well, as far as graphics and the actual looks of the game goes, maybe. I'd be able to recommend it if it had a little more to offer. Games like Kerbal Space Program are better in my personal opinion."
,Recommended,514670,33423707,Posted: 9 July,all,Fuckbeak AND YOU KNOW!!,"Very interesting and unique experience of a space management game with a casual-esque feel. Very peaceful and relaxing with an OST to support this.Problems:-Even in SANDBOX MODE, you need to do contracts and research the new modules and upgrades. I mean... what? This is what sandbox is for- to have all the upgrades to test or play around with.-As people said, it gets grindy fast and pretty repetitive. You can't time warp unless all your satellites are sleeping, so you have to sit and wait for contracts to be finished- even/especially when there's only one in range.-MASSIVE spook every time a new tech. is researched or contract completed.PLEASE give us a way to turn that notification off.-The earth survey missions,where you need to scan locations on the earth's surface, are very fustrating as you either need to alter a satellite's orbit and make it super distorted, or launch a new one. And they orbit at realistic speeds, one orbit every ~90 minutes.-Hardcore is the most fustrating and least engaging, ironically, in that everything is harder and you need more contracts done before you can use any upgrades. The starting satellite has the battery of an iPad and dies even when fully charging. Unlike other hardcore/serious game modes in other games, I don't feel much accomplishment for doing this mode.-The game would probably take about 6-7 hours of play to beat all the contracts to 100%.Overall, was worth the price I paid, I'd reccomend for very casual gaming or for an intro to Kerbal Space Program astrophysics, as it doesn't let you do much outside of orbital mechanics."
,Recommended,514670,32809127,Posted: 26 June,all,FredyC,"It's fun little relaxing game for sure. Controls are not that terrible as many people are complaining about, I've definitely seen worse. It's nice to play it during a break or when you want to clear your occupied mind with something meaningless.Unfortunately game turns into grind very soon with very little reward for your effort. Finish very similar contracts, get money, research something or launch new satellite ... rinse and repeat. Actual research is giving very little benefit after you get tech for major tools. There are some effectivity upgrades, but it mostly makes the tedious job even less interesting.It's pity that development is stopped due to small budget. The game could be so much more with some additional management tasks and/or different challenges for contracts."

76561197982567490,Not Recommended,514670,31250112,Posted: 19 April,all,Nathaniel Prime,"Very unintuitive controls. It seems that the entire game is about fiddling with the functions of the satellite, with not much strategy or tactics to be found. Most games adjust your space equipment to do whatever tasks you assign them, and this game takes the exact opposite approach. It turns out there is a reason most games automate tool use - fussing about with solar panel orientation and such is just not fun."

Hopefully the devs change some things upBut overall good game!"
,Recommended,514670,28502409,"Posted: 20 December, 2016",all,Axiomatta,"The time pressure is the only real driver here. There is no risk from planning different decisions or even not planning at all.That said, this is basically the motivation bit missing from KSP. You get to do science in space with satellites, which never really became a major part of vanilla KSP."
76561198023571784,Recommended,514670,28472339,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,Shadw21,"Updated 12/21/2016:Two days after the post launch review and an update has been pushed out for this game, which addressed many of the points they mentioned brought up and that I wanted to see in the game. Playing it again was definitely worth it, it feels better and now acts more like I was looking for in the game. While it's a bit harder to mess things up/more casual, you are still punished when you forget to do something, like leaving the battery charging while trying to build a new satellite, forgetting to start charging once the satellite is in the sun, or when you have a tool running. Started a new game to see all the changes and I played for much longer this second time around.Would still love to see hard numbers for the satellite resources, both when creating satellites and once it's been launched. Tutorials still need work, I don't think there was a popup window when first entering the engine menu/options for inclination/altitude changes, which while not needed right off the bat, should probably come up when you first enter the menu, or when you first get a mission to H-CAM something on Earth's surface.Final thing I'd like to see changed, or an option added for, is at present is when switching between satellites while in the planet view, the camera zooms in on the newly selected satellite and you have to return to the planet view. It would be awesome if the camera could just center on the newly selected satellite, without zooming all the way in on it, or having some option to change what happens when selecting a different satellite. Not game breaking or anything, simply annoying at times when trying to get multiple satellites woken up, or pointing to a mission object and having to re-orient the camera with each satellite switch.Can't wait for further updates and am no longer considering trying to refund this. I would say this update brought it to a place for those new to these types of games to give it a try and see if it's for them or not. Tutorials may still need some work, but they are clearly better than before the update, and Stormtide seems to be very fast on updates and responding to user feedback.Hard science and KSP fans/players, wait for a hard mode and further improvements, which, if Stormtide keeps updating the game this quickly, could be sooner rather than later.Initial review 12/19/2016:I purchased and played this over the weekend, intrigued after seeing Scott Manley's review of it. While I did enjoy it, I felt there were a number of things that could be greatly improved on and was considering returning it for now as it felt like it was in a Beta state, rather than a full release state.However, I saw this morning that they had a post-launch review and that they would be addressing a number of concerns I had with it, specifically a rebalance of the overheat mechanics and the targeting system. I look forward to the easy and hard game mode types, as I  would love this as something more casual.I feel the time for a satellite to wake-up was fine as it was, though perhaps if the satellite is manually/properly shut down, rather than auto shutting down due to overheating/power loss, then the wakeup time should be reduced. In-game reason could be that's it's skipping a diagnostic step or five.Something I would like to see that wasn't mentioned in the post-launch review, is more information on the resource displays, even just a percentage. It would be helpful and more immersive to me, though since in the system window it gives absolute values of resource gain/depletion, knowing the hard numbers would be even better.All in all, for hard science types and KSP players, this is, or will be, a good buy. For those wanting to get into these types of games, I would wait for the tutorial updates and an easy mode to be made. Overall a good game with potential.I will try to update this review as I play more and see the game updated further."

It is obvious that this is a ported game to PC, but the graphics are quite nice. The gameplay is mission based: you will be given missions regularly that you must complete within a specific amount of time or suffer a reputation penalty; too may failed missions and you will fail the game!  Completed missions reward you with funds, reputation, and progression.  You can also research technologies to make your sattelites more efficient space tools.To note: this is NOT an open world, sandbox game like Kerbal Space Program.  You are limited to controlling sattelites that are placed into Earth orbit for you.That being said, anyone with a decent grasp of orbital mechanics will be able to play through the game without great difficulty.If you are looking for a nice filler satellite management game and can get this on sale (I paid less than $10 for it on sale) then Satellite Command will scratch a nice itch for you."

Why it's easier to destroy sats than repair them? Why the orbits are soo messed up?This game answers a lot of those questions, except it's not really a game, it's sim sat basically."

Overall definitely recommend and will keep playing!"

When I saw Satellite Command on Steam for £6.99, a dramatically lower price that Kerbal, I was taken by how visually stunning it is. I decided to purchase it and give it a try, I found that it is not as complicated as Kerbal and focuses on Earth orbit. I also found myself playing for what I thought was half an hour but was actually a couple of hours. I found it easy going, so I could play at my own pace and also informative. It is a nice zone out game, but the tutorial needs some work (which the developer acknowledges and are working on)."

You make satellites and launch them in the space. Than you can upgrade them to make them better for the harder missions. Here is my update suggestions for the game:-Make a game mode that we can pick the missions. I don't wanna deal with missions while I'm trying to dock my satellite. It's annoying. At least, make seperate game modes. The current one may be the Time Trial mode and the normal one may be the Campaign mode. Just like what we did in Uplink. Pick the missions, and ready to go.-Make some tutorials please. I went crazy while figuring out what am I supposed to do with the docking button. The game's not hard but I, as a player, don't know♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game. Just jumped into it and started playing.-I didn't play that much but you can change the satellite visuals when we upgrade them.-I don't wanna wait while my satellites doing their jobs and my crew is researching something. I should be able to warp the game whenever I want to and while speeding up the game, researches should be done.I'll update my review once I play again. Nice game guys, good price and lots of fun.
