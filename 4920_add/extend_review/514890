,Not Recommended,514890,31109498,Posted: 12 April,all,Lyric,"The game LOOKED fun from the videos, but upon actually playing it, it's not. The movements are not fluid enough, the powerups are hardly usable and very sluggish, and there's a massive lack of consistency between the level difficulty and the boss difficulty. The bosses are the easiest parts of the entire game!Now, I know some will say ""you're too critical about a game on sale for $0.99"", but I take gaming seriously. Quality is everything, even for games worth this amount. I have played games of all price ranges, and there are some 99 cent games out there definitely worth playing, but certainly not this one. I was horribly disappointed and this game seems unfinished to say the least. I could have kept it, but it was so bad that I requested my 99 cents back. I'd rather spend them on trading cards."

Very simple fix, just go to steamapps (or something) and change vertex buffer to 1 in the config/options file.Now as for the game, it has beautiful pixel graphics and classic platformer gameplay. Easy decision to pick this up if you enjoy things like the classic mario games!"

The Steam achievements add a lot of replayability to this game. This game is definitely worth your 99 cents if you are a Mario Bros. fan or classic 2D platformer fan in general. No need to wait for a sale for this one!"

The developer of this game is a nice guy, very polite I liked talking to him. This is actually a really nice game, the only complaint I might have is, the difficulty is pretty hard but that's kind of the point of the game so I won't talk about that much, this game is actually pretty good."

But for the love of all things good, please add save support. I'd like to see this entire game without leaving this game just running all day."

,Recommended,514890,33203455,Posted: 3 July,all,なかの23,"You've been looking for a kind of super mario like game? Then you found it.This game have good challenging stages, some of them make you facepalmon the way you got Jagua killed, and others leave you retrying several timesthe stage trying to pass through a part you were stuck on.Most of this games powerups are good, there are some secrets that eitherteleport you to a room full of loot, or to a future stage.The only problems in this game, is that there is no way of opening themenu while on the map screen, you must enter the world to open themenu, meaning you can't even close the game If you are on the menu,too bad I only discovered that later, and the boss fights are ridiculous, seriously.The bosses have a ridiculous AI and are very predictable, the only boss Ihad problems with were the Pterodactile boss, because weren't timingwell time moment It flies to ground, anyway, bosses are still the easiestpart of the game, at least for now, since I only went up to after the 4th boss.Fun game to pass the time, and for this price, It's worth the money spent.I wonder If it's developer will try making other games."
,Recommended,514890,28754961,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,Ubylmoen,"This is probably the most accurate that a newer game has come to capturing what made retro games so great. There are no gimmicks, the physics are true to retro style games, the music is amazing, if you've been wanting to find a new ""old"" game, this is it.  The levels can become quite difficult, and there isn't a save feature, but this is being quite true to the source material it is (accurately) emulating."
,Recommended,514890,30090629,Posted: 21 February,all,Zarc,"To keep it short and to the point, this is a good, solid retro styled platformer. Fun variety of levels, a few neat powerups, and secrets scattered about in many of the levels.In staying true to the classics, there is the risk of starting over from the beginning once all lives have been used up. However, the game offers a generous coin distribution as you play the levels, and lets you revisit previous levels completed, making it very possible to rack up lives to continue your adventure.The only thing I don't quite like about this game, and while it is an understandable one, is the lack of a save feature. Still, once you know the layout of the levels, I'm sure it's possible to beat it in just a few hours.Honestly though, to find a game that looks great and more importantly is fun to play, that costs less than a dollar? That's more than enough for me to recommend it."
