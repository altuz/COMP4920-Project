Currently it has the basics: The player car, the scores of other cars, moving (abeit all of one kind) and nonmoving obstacles, as well as all manner of unusual track designs.Wishing List-More tracks. Possibly the inclusion of track worlds for increased diversity. Long term ideals would include some sort of level editor along with Workshop support. The future would be boundless!-More obstacles, be it static or dynamic. Of course, maybe there will be additional themes and as such whole new designs with varying dangers can be introduced then!-More cars. Maybe even other different cars. At the very least the road oughta be a bit more crowded to help bring out the exciting clus.. car experience!The concept is more or less nailed down. Apart from the light suggestion or two, the main want is MORE!"

Of course there are the frequent freezes,(You really should get working on that devs) but I was able to make the freezes less often by putting all the settings to the lowest. I'm glad this game is still in beta, because there is a lot of stuff that would help this game really get somewhere.I have a few suggestions.1: Online and local multieplayer would be a blast!2: More variety to the levels. Like boost pads, loops, chain saws/lasers that will cut your car in half, rockets, or maybe even bouce pads.3: Some sort placing system. Like 1st 2nd and 3rd or where you are placed at the begining of the race. You can chose to have it ether where you only have to finish the race, or have it to where you have to get 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.Over all, I really like this game and really recommend it! It's a great laugh for a good hour, and I like to give myself little challanges, like, I have to ram at least one car off the road before finishing the race. Stuff like that.I give this game a 8.5/10"

Poeple have been complaining about crashes and freezes but after completing the game 9yes in that hour) i only had one. It is a very funn midless game that does not require any brain work. That saying it is still very fun. I got it for a buck fifty at the summer sale and for that price it is worth it. No it is not going to be the deal of the centry but it is a cool, and fun game. Leave it in your wishlist till a sale comes then buy it. Also it is has a little play world that i did not expect. it is fun but olny 15 more min of fun before it gets boring. All in all i liked the gameand would recomend it."

76561197987253793,Recommended,514920,28545521,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,triplemerc,"This needs work, full stop. Although the game's premise isn't exactly original - being a blend of Stunt Playground, a freeware classic of old, Trackmania, and Clustertruck - it is fairly interesting! You're racing on tracks with obstacles and competition, but being that it's early access, you're dealing with a limited amount of unique assets on the tracks - I hope you like swinging hammers - and you're dealing with a lack of actual real stakes. If you crash, your weightless-feeling car careens off the track and you start again. Your placement relative to your opponents doesn't matter, finish first, finish last, just finish. Considering it seems to want to be physics-based damage-emphasized car game, it's not actually that satisfying or useful to hit opponents, you simply don't have enough control to recoveer properly, and all the cars are flimsy and easily broken. You're better off just staying away from everyone.So it's not bad - it's definitely a good start - but the physics, the tracks, the driving, all need development. I'm excited to see where it goes, and hope that it has a successful development."

76561198158453435,Not Recommended,514920,29865537,Posted: 11 February,all,What'sItToYah,"Horrible, the game keeps freezing up after one level. Don't buy it. Don't waste your energy, time or money on it. Do NOT under any circumstances buy this game whether you buy it for $5 or $3 (Steam Sale). The game is not worth the money. There's more hassle than there is gameplay. Finish a level and you think you're in the clear, but as soon as you choose next level the counter counts down and the game freezes at ""Go"". I've gotten to level 15 only by restarting the game 15 times. You play a level, then you need to restart the game. Sure you may argue that, that is a bug since the game is still in early access, but there haven't been any updates to the game since I bought it. At the moment it seems that the game was just an asset flip on the developer(s) side. Please listen to me. I am not the only one with these issues. The rating says mostly positive, but when you start reading the reviews, you'll notice that a substantial amount of people have the same issue. I know for a fact that it's not my computer because it can run War Thunder on movie settings at 150-160 fps. I'll say it again and again if I have to, do NOT under any circumstances buy this game. I bought the game when there was only one review, and that review was positive. Read the other reviews and decide for yourself. But I, as well as others, strongly advise that you avoid this game at all costs. It's almost as bad as Airport Simulator."

However, in the 15 minutes that I played, I had SOME fun.I found the gameplay right now to be very, VERY easy. Maybe if the levels were longer, or if actually getting in first place ment something, then it would be difficult, but right now the best strategy is to go AFK at the start, let the other vehicles pass you, then continue on in the free open area.I do have high hopes for this game tho! I can see a bright future for this!Check out my gameplay on it if you want a quick look:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk3VgdXttrE"

,Recommended,514920,28398413,"Posted: 15 December, 2016",all,Vaxen,"(Review edited on 12/16/2016)Dear devs, as you said, you people are going to develop this game based on the feedback of players. I'm really happy you guys do, because I've got a lot of suggestions to do with this awesome game.This game is really awesome! I want to let you know, as a person who has been playing a lot of racing games for more than 10 years long, that this game, which seems to be in Early Access, is heading in the right direction.The idea of making an arcade racing game with damage physics similar to Next Car Game or BeamNG.drive is an amazing idea! And it works surprisingly well.The driving is pretty decent. The car controls with WASD and brakes with Space. Very simple, very decent.The soundtrack is very enjoyable to listen to. It fits the game well.Graphically, not the best thing I've saw, but honestly, graphics don't matter much if the gameplay is good.The gameplay is VERY addictive. It's so fun to race with many other AI cars with damage physics similar to Next Car Game. It leads to unique crashes, saves and race moments that are totally epic. The tracks are short, but the level design of these tracks is excellent.Crash Wheels is heading to the right direction. However, the only problem of the game is the lack of content.However, there are a lot of ways Crash Wheels can obtain much more content.Devs, consider adding/fixing/improving these:---Add a level creator. Since the main tracks are quite simple, it should also be simple to do a custom level. Have workshop support if it's possible---Add more cars. Having the possibility of driving only one car isn't good. Or at least, make that car customisable. Let players change the colors of the car.---The racing is hard. I'm not sure if there is a drafting system, but if there is, make the drafting more effective. If there's no drafting, add drafting. Or else, it's hard to outrun some AI cars.---If I'm not the first car to reach the finish line, the game still says that I've won. While it might be a reference to Big Rigs, I think it shouldn't say that I've won.---If I try to crash an AI car while driving, I will very easily lose control of my car. While it kind of works, I think the intensity of the loss of control should be toned down a bit.---Add more options, such as a way to change the controls, mute the music or sounds, etc.---Add multiplayer. Both Local and Online multiplayer will work.---Add different camera views, such as a view in the interior of the car, on the hood, etc.---Make the suspension slightly softer. Right now, the suspension is too hard.---Improve the interface of the menus. While there is nothing wrong with simplicity, it would be prettier to have a better looking interface, making the game more professional-looking.---The collision between the sledgehammers and the cars can be quite glitchy. Fix this issue ASAP.In conclusion, you should definitely buy Crash Wheels. It's a very simple game, but it has a bright future and a lot of potential."
