,Recommended,515040,25791969,"Posted: 30 September, 2016",all,Hurt by Johnny Cash,"Before I bought this game, I thought about what I expected from it. My expectations were:- Entertaining for 10 minutes, until the novelty wears off- Rote, grinding gameplay- Low replay value- Average game overallThis game more or less met my expectations.The core gameplay is centred around two main goals, paying off the national debt and defeating the Islamic State.To pay off the national debt, you fly around a world map buying and selling oil, supplies, and food to make a profit and pay off the national debt, with a few trivial mechanics such as the ability to invade countries and drill in Alaska for oil, but the restriction on doing these things is the threat of angering other countries and setting off WW3, which is the only losing scenario. The trade is repetitive and gets rote very fast, and it takes a lot of it to pay off the national debt. This took up the majority of my time in-game, I must have spent about 90% of it trading and using the related mechanics. To defeat the Islamic State, the other goal of the game, you have to play an arcade game in which Trump fights ISIS soldiers, which is funny the first time, and annoying the second time. You don't know how long the levels are or how much is left, it's difficult to aim, and it's really only fun the first time you play it.The novelty of the game wore off very fast. There aren't many Trump sound bites, and while they're funny the first few times, they get annoying after a while, along with the soundtrack, and after about half an hour I muted the game and switched on spotify.  Having pepe as the newsfrog was funny at first, but like pretty much everything else in the game, it lost its comedic value rapidly.After completing the game the first time, I started a new one, but couldn't be bothered to finish it. There's little replay value here, it's just the same grind all over again. You probably won't be inclined to replay it unless you're an achievement hunter.Overall this game is average, but I still recommend it. It's better than a lot of indie games I've played, and it's great for a quick laugh, even if it's lacking in a bit of substance beyond that. It doesn't overcharge (at the time of writing) for a game you'll probably only play through once or twice at most."

While playing the game, you will notice that it mocks the stereotypical view of the way some americans see the rest of the world.Based on a satirical immersion of Donald Trump's Presidency, this game has elements of practicality in it. While the game pokes fun at what Trump has said in the past, there is an element of seriousness involved where the unknown actions of the Presidential Candidate have been so heavily speculated to the point where people automatically assume that Trump will do these kinds of things if he becomes POTUS.Regardless of your political views, this game is a good way to pretend that you're taking those speculated actions of Donald Trump and carrying them out to see how the other countries will react. Rest assured, it's just a game, and it serves no purpose other than to make you laugh."

Its true, its true. I know a lot of people, I know how to make deals. China beats us all the time. You know China right? They beat us ALL the time. But I love the Chinese, I make great deals with them! That's the point, they have smart leaders, we have stupid leaders. But not anymore, not anymore. So this game shows up and it's like WHAT? Subscription based? Ay ay ay, I knew it wouldn't last long. And guess what I was RIGHT. It went F2P. You know why? Because they realized how stupid they were and they took my advice, make it F2P, create a lot of ingame purchases, and you have to tell the Chinese, “Listen you motherf—–s! We’re going to tax you 25 percent!” and it will work! So this game goes F2P, and guess what the ratings go up, they make better expansions, but then a new guy takes over and screws everything up. This total loser Perfect World Entertainment. who by the way is so low in the polls he should just drop out. Can you believe it? He spent so much money on ads and he's at 3% I spent almost NOTHING and I'm on top. Anyways, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. I keep seeing these new ships in the game from the Delta Quadrant. Who wants to play in the Delta Quadrant? And now they are bringing them in can you believe it? They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, they should not be anywhere near our solar system. We will build a wall I tell you, which by the way Mexico will pay for, we will do it. And it's going to be so high once you go up you wont want to come down. Anyways, this game, it's good, it's good, you should play it before our leaders make another stupid deal. Oh and by the way, the media, they are totally dishonest, some of the worst people out there, not all of them, but most. Don't trust the reviews. Look at them they wont move the cameras! They never show the crowd they have the camera zoomed in to my face! HEY you blonde lady! Turn the cameras around, turn them around! I will make America great again, I will do it.

Although I wouldn't say thats a bad thing. The game has four main goals:Max-out the American economy.Defeat ISIS.Pay of the national debt.Don't start World War III.But the games length and the way it's handled makes these goals fun. You max out the economy by buying upgrades with commodities such as food, product, and oil. This is one of my favorite parts of the game. Commodities can be bought from and sold to other countries, but prices are constantly changing. Occassionally prices will plummet or skyrocket for brief periods of time, which makes buying low and selling high more dynamic. Money and commodities can also be gained by invading other countries.In contrast, defeating ISIS consists of defeating hordes of enemies in a survival mini game. While the free market trade mechanics are engaging, fighting ISIS is repetitive. There are commodities and money to be won by finishing a game, but since there are upgrades that are required to finish some of the ""Fight ISIS""mini games, you won't always be able to finish what you start.Upgrades can be unlocked through international relations. Goods can be bought and sold from other countries, but you can also send relief to countries, invade other countries, threaten other countries (to lower prices), schmooze other countries (to charge higher prices), and drill for oil in alaska. These actions will often raise or lower individual countries fear (lowers prices ) and love(raises selling values), or the overall world tension. If world tension rises to much World War III will begin, which acts as a gameover. But more specific actions (e.g buy x amount of y in country z) will unlock upgrades that can be used in Fight ISIS minigames or the main game. Some are optional, but a few are required to complete the game.In conclusion MAGA is meme game. That's about it."

Being satire, Make America Great Again is subject to Poe's law.I found it both very comical, with very good gameplay.  You control Trump's helicopter and fly around the world making fantastic deals.

Furthermore, you'll get three guaranteed trading card drops which will likely add up to $1.50 in your steam wallet when sold (October 2016). So in essence, the game is a steal.+ Play as Donald Trump! Trade with countries across the globe, purchasing oil, arms and food during market crashes, then profit by selling it later. Pay off national debt and defeat ISIS in 5 minigames to win.+ Build the wall and secure the border!+ Provide emergency aid, food during world crisis' and policing to make countries love America, or fire missiles and launch an invasion to increase their fear. These options directly affect trade.Negatives:- Bad graphics and interface.- Some repetition after awhile, lacking depth.- Short game, around 5 hours.- The game itself is really basic. If it had just a little more effort and development time, the world map would not look so cartoonish, the controls would be customisable, there would be options for sound in the menu and overall it would have that feeling of professionalism and seriousness, resulting in a rather appealing albeit simplistic political-trade title.Overall score: 5/10I recommend this game for Trump fans that have a bit of extra time to spend.

The game basicly consists of you flying from country to country looking for a deal on resources, buying them, and then getting a stupidly one sided deal for yourself. When you fight isis it is a scrolling helicopter game, the hitboxes are bad, and the gameplay is not that well thought out, but I think it somehow fits the game.Pros-Addictive-Content for Price-UICons-Hitboxes during ISIS missions-Tutorial completes to much-Keybinding can cause uninteltional invasions-Content for a diplomacy/stratagy game-To Easy (Specificly Debt)Overall, for $3 it is a great political satire.

Of cause this game is not even trying to be an exact image of Politics, but just an entertaining funny little game. You have to handle the national debt, trade with other countries, defeat ISIS and you can even start wars with other countries. The gameplay gets pretty repetitive after a few hours, but for 3 $ you can`t really expect more. The way the game was done is pretty entertaining.

,Recommended,515040,32748268,Posted: 24 June,all,RaZman,"Simplified strategy game surprisingly rich on content. In the role of President Donald Trump you start the game with three goals: Defeat ISIS, clear the national debt and maximize US production, all to Make America Great Again.To maximize US-production you have to buy and sell products from different countries and continents, the simple but addicting strategy is to follow the global economy and buy cheap to sell expensive. Every country has fluctuating prices on the three resources (oil, supplies, food) and it's up to the player to either wait for the prices to drop and increase, or simply threaten or negotiate with the countries to make the prices go one way or another. With enough resources the national production can be upgraded in six levels, max out the updrages to clear the goal. The mechanics of this goal is tied to clearing the national debt and you simply continue buying cheap, selling expensive until the debt is cleared.To defeat ISIS you enter a mini-game in the style of a 2D shooter in which you control President Trump flying a chopper shooting down ISIS-forces. This spans over five levels of increasing difficulty and ends in a boss-fight. To clear these levels you have to upgrade your chopper with armor and weapons, this is done by unlocking achievements connected to trading with the different countries on the world map; Upgrade the chopper to handle the more difficult enemies. The mini-game is not only well made but offers some well-needed variety to the game as a whole. It's a nice nostalgic throwback to the Megadrvie/Genesis-days.I took my time trying to unlock as many trading achievements as possible in my first run and the game lasted just over four hours. Based on the entertainment provided during these hours I have to consider this game fantastic, especially for the price. I highly recommend this game for those looking for a simplified strategy game with a healthy dose of comedy, for €0.74/2.99 it doesn't get much better than this."

Thank you very much.I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us. On our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign.I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I mean that very sincerely.Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together.To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. It is time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be President for all of Americans, and this is so important to me.For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family.It is a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs, who want and expect our government to serve the people - and serve the people it will.Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business, looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world.That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well. Tremendous potential. It is going to be a beautiful thing.Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.We will also finally take care of our great veterans who have been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people.We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people, and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It is going to happen.We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will have great relationships.We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country, and beautiful things and successful things once again.I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.And now I would like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight a very, very historic victory. First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great people.I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. Truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Marianne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. Where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert, and they should be on this stage, but that's okay. They're great. And also my late brother Fred, great guy. Fantastic guy. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents.To Melania and Don and Ivanka and Eric and Tiffany and Barron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty, and it is tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all.Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all of the people that we have. Look at all of these people.And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here, and I want to tell you it's been very, very special.I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. He's unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings, and Rudy never changes. Where is Rudy. Where is he?Gov. Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, Chris. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he is as smart as you get.Sen. Jeff Sessions. Where is Jeff? A great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? Is that Rudy? Up here. Really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats, Dr. Ben Carson. Where's Ben? Where is Ben?By the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family Sarah, thank you very much. Gen. Mike Flynn. Where is Mike?And Gen. Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign and they are special people. We have 22 Congressional Medal of Honor people. A very special person who, believe me, I read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is ... that's right, how did you possibly guess?Let me tell you about Reince. I've said Reince. I know it. I know it. Look at all of those people over there. I know it, Reince is a superstar. I said, they can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win it. Like Secretariat. He would not have that bust at the track at Belmont.Reince is really a star and he is the hardest-working guy, and in a certain way I did this. Reince, come up here. Get over here, Reince. Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. It's about time you did this right. My god. Nah, come here. Say something. Amazing guy.Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success and what we've done, so I also have to say, I've gotten to know some incredible people. The Secret Service people. They're tough and they're smart and they're sharp and I don't want to mess around with them, I can tell you.And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down in the seat, but they are fantastic people so I want to thank the Secret Service. And law enforcement in New York City, they're here tonight. These are spectacular people, sometimes underappreciated unfortunately. We appreciate them.So it's been what they call a historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job, and I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do"

We've got great great graphics. They're just great!SoundThe sound is just great! There are so many sounds and they sound so great. You're going to love it!StorylineStoryline?? I'm not sure what that means?? Like the story??OverallI'm going to give my personal recommendation for this game. It's so great. Once you get this game, you'll be begging to stop playing because of how great it is!Honest ReviewI voted for Hilary. I was one of those people who couldn't sleep the night of the election. The fear of an America rampant with hatred, racism, & xenophobia was all too real to me.Well, that didn't happen... not yet anyway, and it doesn't look like it will. To me, it seems like this may not be as bad as I initially thought. I saw a friend playing this game and thought that it would be a good coping mechanism for me. It did help, in some ways, to relieve a bit of the anxiety.Make America Great Again: The Trump Presidency is not a bad game, it's not a great game either. You control Trump who's in a helicopter and go around the world making deals and fighting ISIS. The controls are a bit clunky. Or rather, moving around from one end of the map to the other feels a bit labored. The countries aren't always easy to find. I didn't know that Europe, France, & England were 3 separate things you could click on at first.Making deals is a bit arduous, esp since most of the countries with good buy/sell prices are the smallest, meaning you can only sell 5 units at a time. You can threaten or bomb countries to get them to lower their prices, which was fun. I threatened India and failed; so I bombed the shiite out of them and took their goods for next to nothing. AMERICAAs far as combat goes, this game has it. It's a bullethell-lite style of play. I did fell like the hit box on Trump's chopper was a bit too big. But, if you take the time to get your upgrades before you go to battle there's really not much of a challenge there.Overall this isn't a bad game and I would recommend it to all my friends, no matter who they voted for. It's a serious satire that doesn't bring in any of the hate mongering we were told to believe during the campaign."

It is satire at it's finest as the game may seem to glorify Trump but his exaggerated nature and pro-America message is a dead give away; critics and Hillary supporters need to calm down and have fun at Trump expense by playing this game instead of rioting in the streets.Overall, nothing to write home about the graphics, voice acting, or game play. Mostly, the graphics looks like a flash game, voice is just a spliced and paste of Donald's speech to comedic effect (I'm like a chess grand master playing against a checkers child), and game play is about max/min mircomanagement with the point and click combat scenario thrown in involving Trump in the helicopter shooting at ISIS terrorists in CANADA (of all places).Really fun and funny game as it is one of a fee that had me crying with laughter at the sheer comedic genius of this game.

I like games where you don't get to screw over tronald dump.  Sad!Serious review: this game is of the quality that you'd find free on Newgrounds in 2003.  It's replete with cartoonishly bad animations and random sound clips of Tump's voice firing off at seemingly random intervals, sometimes for long seconds after you've finished thei nteraction that triggered it.  The screenshots are totally misleading, as this is not in any way resembling strategic play where you can click on stuff, but instead use your keyboard to drag the comic trump helicopter in a crooked position so its finger is pointing on the country in question.  You don't use the mouse for anything other than clicking to open menus.Past the first minute or so of tutorial, the game sets into a plodding pace where you could spend theoretically hours doing nothing but buying and selling oil, boxes, or cow heads to/from the same 8 countries to raise money to pay off debt and do the actions to unlock achievements.And unless you consider random snippets of odnald trump speeches and an occasional pop-up of Pepe to be memes, this game has no memes, and has a theme to it almost like Team America World Police without any satire or self-awareness.tl;dr maga hashtag benghazi lock her up not my benghazi:It's a scam of a game.  The kind of thing you'd find for free on a Newgrounds type site linked off The-Donald subreddit (which is the only thing meme-related referenced).  Of the description, just like trum, only about 30% of it is truthful, and makes me think the person who wrote the description has no idea what ""parody"" means.  Or ""memes"".  Or ""comedic"".

How about the flash game with Bush and Gore boxing?If you can somehow dig that out of your memory, then this game will bring all those good times running right over you in all  their topical glory!MAGA: The Trump Presidency is essentially a flash game that you pay for, but is it really worth a few dollars?Kind of.To be honest, the interface is a little difficult to get a hold of for the first few minutes and you might find yourself clicking on the wrong country every now and then, but it's by no means the worst thing I've ever encountered. Aside from that, there's a very (very) simplified form of resource management that boils down to trying not to blow the US to smithereens - with a few truly Newgrounds-style flash mini-games in-between. The mini-games are simple side-scrolling shooters and platformers, so don't be surprised at the lack of originality; though, for a quickly made, topical game, it's not surprising in the first place.The real attraction here for me, though, were the sound bytes from Trump's speeches peppered into the gameplay. Whether you like him or not, it's at least amusing to hear him spout his more famous sayings while blasting away ISIS operatives or building the wall on the Southern border.Personally, I thought it was a fun little romp for a few bucks.Have fun!EDIT (10/2/2016): I noticed the dislikes are probably because the cards aren't worth as much as when I wrote this review.

You buy low and sell high in addition to other sidequests. For $3 it's not a bad deal especially if you want to pimp out your Steam profile in support of Donald. I'd recommend it to any Trump supporter. They give a shout out to The_Donald on reddit in support of God Emperor Trump as soon as you start the game. It's done well enough that I'll likely complete it to add to my total. The mouse cursor is a bit annoying because it doesn't always show up, but you get used to it. A little more polish wouldn't hurt especially on the graphics. Regardless, if you support Trump buy the game. The forum trolling alone is worth the $3 price tag since no pro Trump groups took hold. This allows us a unique opportunity to troll the HRC supporters which is pretty much condemned over on The_Donald right now since saying or posting anything that could hurt feelings is suddenly assault instead of free speech.If the game were not about Trump I'd never have purchased it but since everything the God Emperor blesses turns to gold it's a 10/10.

Honestly, the UI is one of the most terrible I've ever seen. And mind you, I worked with SAP.But that's only the start. In essence, the game objective is ""buy low, sell high"". Because, hehe, Trump is the Wizard of the Deal, isn't he? Well, that's not even lol. That's not what the Trump presidency is about. Not even being a US citizen (I'm from Germany), so many things come to my mind that, if properly implemented, would have made this game quite a lot of fun (in the Imgur-Reddit sense of fun): liberal media, wigs, orange make-up and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-long red ties, putting Clinton into jail, alternative reality, draining the swamp, Trumpcare, Sean Spicer, press conferences in general, Kellyanne Conway, wiretapping, Breitbart headlines and Alex Jones rants, innercity communities (yo bro!), import taxes, Putin, China, 2nd amendment people, Ivanka-brand jewelry ... ok, there's a Mexican border wall, at least. But: you build it, and that's it. Why not keeping Mexicans from using ladders or digging tunnels? There is a megaton of good jokes (no matter which your political affiliation may be) waiting directly in front of your tiny fingers that the game simply misses.Furthermore, the ingame challenges. Which I'm not fond of (because, if I want to play an action shooter or a puzzle game, I buy one). Anyway: Killing IS terrorists from a helicopter? Are you freaking serious? That's as far as your imagination gets? Why not a tweeting contest? Or a ♥♥♥♥♥-grabbing challenge? Or, the opposite, try to avoid any female reporter that's less than a 8/10? Or a helicopter race to Mar-a-Lago, while liberal snowflakes and the White House press corps tries to stop you?Frankly, I'm a awful programmer and don't understand anything about game AI or graphics programming.

,Recommended,515040,33569642,Posted: 15 July,all,Whistler,This game has taught me much about the current US president.I truly feel ashamed how judgemental WE all feel towards him.This game truly proves what a shining beacon of goodness Donald Trump is.Especially in the level where Trump visits the orphanage and gives a freezing little boy his gloves.These little moments truly make the game worth playing.I expect to spend many weeks playing this game in the future.God bless the US.

Obviously you will buy this game for the lulz and not for the gameplay experience, but I can tell you, it was easily worth the 0.74$ which I paid for it, very funny game, it is worth buying on a sale.Praise KEK I guess(PS: You get Pepe Steam emotes, which makes it easily worth it)"

Wenn ich könnte, würde ich durch dieses Spiel 100 mal und gib es allen meinen Freunden zweimal. Dieses Spiel geht über alles hinaus, was in einem modernen Klassiker benötigt wird. Dieses Spiel hat die besten Ghrapics, die ich je gesehen habe mit meinen eigenen Augen auf diesem Planeten namens Erde. Die Geschichte ist gut und macht dich über dein Leben nachdenken. Dieses Spiel sollte loben als eins oder wenn nicht das beste Spiel HANDS DOWN in der Welt"
