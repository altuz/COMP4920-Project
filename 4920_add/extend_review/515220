,Recommended,515220,34514639,Posted: 26 August,all,Araripe,"It was a long – but rewarding – wait. F1 2017 is finally out and it definitely matched my expectations. From classic cars to an unbelievably good career mode, the game got everything that we all have been dreaming of ever since the first title, back in 2010. It took way more time than it should have taken, but the timing couldn’t have been better. The current cars are faster than ever, and the wider body and tyres allow for an insane “wing-to-wing” race (door-to-door wouldn’t fit, amirite?). The real thing might not be as exciting as expected, with not so many overtakes and barely entertaining, but F1 2017 is exactly what the real deal wanted to be: fast, wild, competitive. You will laugh, cry and sweat through every single race. After all, that’s what Formula 1 used to be way back then. Codemasters brought it back like never before. The spirit of F1 is back.Due to the fact that the 2017 cars got wider tires and body (and additional weight), resulting on more grip and downforce, the handling model had to be improved in order to provide a proper driving feel. It’s a night and day difference if you compare it to the previous title. You can finally feel the car instead of that classical “numbness” that had always been present in each and every Codemasters title. The force feedback was also gotten right, meaning that you can finally feel the weight transfer while cornering and also quite a few bumps here and there (most tracks are completely flat though). It’s definitely a huge step forward into the simulation field. It’s not there yet, but it comes pretty damn close.The success of F1 2016’s career mode made me think that Codemasters would keep that untouched on the next title, as most developers opt for when they get something right. Surprisingly, they went even deeper into it, allowing for an extremely complex upgrade tree, which is exactly like the real deal (it seems so). While the old one had a tree, it wasn’t quite as deep, with just a couple key elements (Engine, Fuel Efficiency, Chassis, Downforce and Drag). The new tree, though, goes way further into the underworld of F1 mechanics, which is definitely a huge positive aspect for die-hard fans of the category. Newcomers, though, might get a bit scared of such complexity. Complexities apart, it was definitely a step into the right direction when it comes to replicating the life of a pilot. As if it could not get any better, engine parts can get worn out as you push your car to its limits, leading to unexpected failures and moments of anger. As frustrating as it could be, that’s how it is. Formula 1 is not a magical world where everything goes wonderfully well if you don’t crash. Engines may fail, and this addition shows how compromised they are with delivering an unparalleled F1 title. Kudos for that.The graphics were also improved, which makes it even more immersive than before. The boring motion blur is still there, but you’ll get used to it, eventually. The textures were hugely improved, making it as closer as possible to the real thing. The color palette, though, is quite a bit off. It’s way too colorful and makes trackside details look rather dull. Nothing that changing the gamma settings could not “fix”, and that hardly takes the bright out of the great handling model and the game as a whole. Talking about eye candy, they added a Photo Mode. If you are into taking screenshots, that is definitely a huge selling point. You can pick any angle you want, and change saturation, exposure, brightness, contrast, shutter speed, etc… It’s pretty much like a built-in DSLR camera just waiting for you to take the most beautiful shots ever. Performance-wise, it’s pretty lightweight. I managed to get 60 fps on high/ultra settings with a GTX880M at 1080p. Not bad at all. And it runs on integrated graphics cards like any EGO engine title. Don’t expect to max it out, but it’s definitely playable on low-med settings.Oh, I almost forgot about the best part: classic cars! Yes, they are back! With classics like the MP4/4 and the F2004, you’ll be able to experience each and every of these beasts on a selection of special events (so-called invitationals) on career mode. And, of course, you can also drive them on Grand Prix mode, Time Trial, etc… It’s just like F1 2013’s Classic DLC, but miles better. Not to mention that it comes with the base game, except for the MP4/4 which is a bonus content until October 18th. It’s definitely the most complete F1 game by Codemasters, content-wise.It was definitely worth the long wait. The cars feel great, the artificial intelligence got smarter and faster, there are plenty of new game modes and, of course, the classic content. Bundle it all together and boom, you’ve got a masterpiece. That’s exactly what Codemasters achieved with F1 2017. Simulation-wise, it’s not quite there yet, but who cares? It’s complete and fun, and that’s the point. Anyway, who’d enjoy changing engine modes and braking profiles from corner to corner? Because that’s how the real thing works. Maybe it’s simcade for a good reason. It wouldn’t be as fun, not to mention that it would become a niche game, while the developers want the exact opposite (sales are important, ya know?). Codies found the perfect balance between simulation and arcade, and I got to say that I liked what I’ve seen so far.Read the full reviewhere"

,Recommended,515220,34945448,Posted: 14 September,all,MrGhostO1O,"MENUSThe menus in Codemasters's F1 2017 are very simple and well looking. You can easily find what you are looking for and never get lost. It does not take up too much space of the screen and they like adding pictures to the main menu which makes it look even better.As in previous games, there is no mouse support which could make one or the other hardcore pc gamers raise their pulse rate.GRAPHICSI really like the way that Codemasters went with the graphics. The previous title, F1 2016, had too much color and brightness. F1 2017 looks much cooler and welcome compared to its predecessor. In the options menu you can change many settings to fine tune your visual experience and performance. The Benchmark tool is one of the best that the games of the current time have to offer and it lets you test your performance with the settings you have selected on any track as well as condition you like.There are a few flaws in the game connected to the graphics. Even with motion blur set to 0%, the surrounding textures start to blur when the car is in motion. This can make the game look fuzzy and irritating while driving. There are also many reports of missing textures (textures are completely black) and colored lines appearing on the screen.AUDIOThe audio of the game has not changed too much from its predecessor. The engine sounds are the same with a little louder whistle from the turbo. Contact and crash sounds are also mostly the same. In the options menu, you can change the volume of the different sounds, such as master sound, voice, car etc. . You can also switch to push to talk or deactivate voice chat from others in multiplayer lobbies completely. Your ingame engineer, Jeff, can also be changed to speak only when there are critical situations.There are also issues with audio in the game as well. After patch 1.6, many players report missing audio or audio stutter. Unfortunately, in order to turn off the commentators at the beginning and end of a session, the player must turn down the voice volume, which also turns down the individuals talking to you in the paddock area.CONTROLSSetting up the controls in the menu has become more detailed and user friendly compared to the previous title. The player can now use presets for his wheel or change them to make his/her own mapping which he/she can save. There are also wheel specific settings that the player can change, like the throttle saturation or wheel dead zone.CAR HANDLINGThe handling of the cars is the best that Codemasters has ever programmed. The the cars have a lot of mechanical and aerodynamical grip meaning that the car has very good traction exiting and very good grip through high speed corners. It just feels like you can do everything with the car. The force feedback on the wheels has been increased and the player can now feel every single bump on the road.Many players report the force feedback disabling completely all of a sudden in multiplayer races. Decreasing the enviromental effects can make up a few tenths of a second.MODERN CARSThe modern cars models have been recreated very accurately from the first grand prix.The liveries are not correct though. FIA have made a rule to make the drivers more visible by increasing the driver number and short name on the cars. The goal was to personalize the cars more to their drivers. F1 2017 players are still waiting for an update from Codemasters to make the liveries accurate to the current ones in real life. Due to the PEGI 3 rating of the game, Codemasters are not allowed to include alcoholic sponsors, which are on the cars in real life as well.CLASSIC CARSCodemasters brought back the classic cars mode that was last seen in F1 2013. The player can do custom events and challenges using one of the 12 available classic cars from the past 30 years. The handling and the looks of the cars are breathtaking and the same goes for the sounds. The player can also use them in multiplayer.Due to the different programming of the engines and gearboxes, they cannot be set to the same performance in multiplayer lobbies.EVENT MODECodemasters use the event mode to challenge the F1 players. They also use it as a qualifying method for the new esports event that was announced. The events are changed from week to week.CAREER MODECodemasters have again taken the career mode to a higher level of realism, expanding on the fundaments of its predecessor, by adding more practice programms such as fuel saving and race strategy as well as adding the ability to change parts of the engine and the entire gearbox should they wear to much. Like in the real sport, the player will receive grid penalties should he/she resort to a fifth unit of an engine part or change a gearbox. The player can reduce the wear by either following the instructions in the parts descriptions or upgrading the duration department of the Research&Development Tree, which is a massive upgrade to the previous, simple and overpowerd upgrade system of the last title. It is devided into 4 departments, which are durability, powertrain, aerodynamics and chassis. Each of the departments have their own branches of minor and major upgrades that increase the performance of the upgraded department. The process is much slower and more expensive than in the previous game, making the comletion of practice programms vital for the car development. In total the R&D tree covers 115 unlockable upgrades. The safety car (SC) and virtual safety car (VSC) have been improved. Players will not be able to exploit the VSC without being penalized by pushing over the delta limit right before it ends.The replay mode has not changed.MULTIPLAYERThe multiplayer of the game has not changed a lot from the previous title. The only additions are 2 spectator slots in lobbies, short layouts of a few tracks and a ranking system, which saves the players stats and increases his/her level by gaining points through races.From launch onwards, the multiplayer was very unstable. Players were disqualified at the end of races and collsions did not work. Cars that retire stop on the side of the roads and never disappear, causing a constant yellow flag situation in that sector. Blue flags are not shown and corner cutting is very easy to get away with as the system somehow does not recognize the player going 10 feet left or right from where they are supposed to be. The spectator cameras have not been improved at all from its predecessor and there are still no live standings with gaps. The multiplayer still has no report option to report players who crash others out on purpose, ruining the experience for others.CONCLUSIONF1 2017, in terms of the single player aspect, it is by far the best that Codemasters have ever created. The rules and regulations as well as practice programs and upgrades are very realistic, accurate, balanced and a lot of fun. The cars feel amazing to drive the classic cars make you feel like Michael Schumacher in his glory days. The multiplayer however is a literal mess. The bugs and glitches as well as trolls ruin the experience. There have been no major improvements except 2 spectator slots, which do not have the tools to make good live streams for esports and league events. Through already many patches and a little luck, some multiplayer sessions work well and as they are supposed to, but most times they unfortunately do not, making leagues not possible at this point.MY OPINIONThe multiplayer has been ignored this year too. It is a mess and league cannot run properly like in F1 2013. Leagues are as much of a reason for Codemasters success as the Career mode, making it as important.Unfortunately Codemasters does not seem to care too much.I still recommend the game though.My rating: 8/10 (the career mode saved it from a 5/10)Let me know what you think!I am open for respectful discussions!"

Best Codie's game so far.However, I've noticed I am able to take Copse at Silverstone flat out in top gear for all cars, modern and historic. I know for a fact that 1990-2017 cars all needed to lift through Copse, so I am a bit confused by this. Additionally, you can stay absolutely flat out all the way through Maggots, and through the left turn of Becketts in modern and historic cars, which definteily isn't correct.It's only been out for 10 hours, so hopefully it will be tweaked a bit. I feel all cars have too much highspeed grip. Curious as to what other's think? Other than that, it's good to see that not too much of the model has changed since beta (I was in the beta test), and I think the final product is very good so far!"

But multiplayer is basically unplayable right now and there are many other bugs and glitches in this years release.Two steps forward, one step back and one step sidewards. I recommend this game to all F1 and Motorsport fans.8/10EDIT: Mclaren-Honda Carrer Mode engine R&D upgrades are broken and do not work... you could not make this up... not sure if this is a positive for realism or a negative because it's a game breaking bug..."
,Recommended,515220,34486805,Posted: 25 August,all,Broeckoli Boop™,"This is a single player review, as I'm not one to play multiplayer nowadays, but most of this review is still relevant, as it covers the entire core of the game.Having already played nearly 6 hours on release day, and having spent around 500 hours on F1 2016, I've just about completed my first 100% distance race on Ultimate difficulty in the Renault.My thoughts so far? Stunning.I have never been so impressed by a games launch, it's just great.The game is very well optimised, running on max settings with an MSI GTX 980 (the recommended GPU is a GTX 1070!), FX 8350 and 16GB of RAM, with an average fps of pretty much 60. Temps are within acceptable levels, with only the infrequent frame spike (which may be patchable, but barely a hassle).With no assists and a Logitech G29 steering wheel and pedals, the car can be difficult to drive, and you can really tell the drop off in tyre performance as your stint goes on, with the car sliding and twitching through all manner of corners. Once you've hooked up a corner perfectly? It's a fantastic sensation, and you can really sense the time gained. The car evolves during the race as the fuel runs down, and by that last stint, if you've saved enough fuel, you can really gun it to the end if you've got the car and strategy just right. The practice programes are shorter, but even more informative for your race, a perfect balance. There is a real sense of reward throught the race weekend, and it keeps you hooked and wanting to gain just a bit more.The AI is a struggle to fight with maxed out at 110%, you really have to push while conserving your tyres and lifting and coasting (yes, you really have to do that for this title, it's so immersive). They attack, defend (could still be slightly improved on on those fronts though) and make mistakes. Also, in qualifying, they no longer make the silly mistake of leaving the pitland with no chance to start a new lap before the timer runs out, which is a plus for the immersion. However, the AI seems to be quicker when time is accelarated, so that may need to be looked at. For now though, you can do as the AI does, and start a lap before the timer runs out to make sure none of the AI put in a lap time oddly quicker than in real time.The added additions to career mode, such as the R&D, the new suites for that and your personal manager, and car management from your laptop, is simply wonderful. A lot more time and dedication is needed to progress your car and your reputation, the game won't be over in a matter of two seasons.I have yet to encounter any issues, and any issues found will likely be fixed thanks to how well the product has been released, and how much time Codemasters have until they need to focus all their attention on the next F1 title. In time, I believe the game will be moddable in at least the same way as F1 2016 (which you'll be able to find of RaceDepartment), prolonging your interest in career mode and keeping it fresh.If you're an F1 fan, this game is a must. If not, but always been interested or tempted by the racing series or motorsport in general, you'll appreciate this game as something different, realistic and challenging, with plenty of replayability with the classic cars, career mode, multiple kinds of championships you can run.EDIT: Oh boy the R26 is a joy to drive. I forgot to mention the classic cars specifically, but the way it's tied into career mode is great; short, sweet, leaves you wanting for more and is nice reward at the end of your first career race."

,Recommended,515220,34761668,Posted: 5 September,all,LikeWildFire™,"F1 2017 takes the F1 franchise to a whole new level, and will most likely be the very last F1 game I buy from Codies, because next year, cars will get a halo. That kills all hype for next year.Unlike 2016, in 2017 you can push the car to your maximum pace without risking going off track, because there is much more downforce and grop (Just like in real life lol).Pros:- Classic Cars (A dream come true for any F1 fan)- Short layouts for some of the tracks (which could make some races interesting, especially online)- Cockpit view has much better visibility than last year (You don't even need to tweak its Camera Settings to see the track ahead well if you're a cockpit view player)- Helmet customizable at any time (Colours and design as well. This could be particularly nice if you're changing teams and need to change the helmet colours to reflect your current team's)- Race pace is much more realistic and rewarding (You don't need to push like a madman and abuse lock ups on braking zones for a good pace, consistency and smoothness is key)- Transition from Formation Lap to Race Start Light sequence no longer triggered by a black screen (for added immersion)- HUGE R&D development system that will take you almost all 10 seasons to max out (Instead of the ridiculous 2-season long R&D system last year)- Engine Management (Must manage the engine wear in order to maintain reliability on top during the course of a season)- Pit Limiter is now Manual (must trigger it before crossing the pit lane entrance, which is a nice feature)- Pit stops now have manual launch (To make you have a more active role during pitstops)- Multiplayer now features a Rank system with Stats (Wins, Podiums, Poles, Average Qualifying Position, Average Finishing Position, and more)- AI difficulty adjustable from 1 to 110 (Instead of presets like Easy Medium Hard etc.. This allows players of all skill levels to enjoy a much more realistic race. AI will no longer be too slow or too fast for the player)Cons:- Formation lap is still not fully manual! (It's a huge turn off for hardcore simulation F1 fans)- Pit driving still not Manual! (I hate not being able to drive the car inside the pits myself, as doing so could giev you a much more realistic pace over the course of a race)- Damage model remains unchanged (Apart from rear wheel damage, which is the only change so far in my book)- Multiplayer hasn't worked on lag issues at all (Not sure why)Despite all these Cons, this game will remain one of my absolute eternal favorite games of all time. As an F1 fan, it gives me the immersion I need to feel like I'm actually part of the F1 grid.The AI difficulty is much better than last year. I can finally enjoy a good challenging race that will keep me focused and make me feel like there is work to do (such as catching up on the car ahead after a pitstop)9.5/10 <3"

As a fan of sim racing I have the whole kit and kaboodle, nothing fancy like a direct drive wheel (I own a CSW 2.5) but for what shortcomings F1 2017 has I believe it to be the best complete package out there for racing fans.The sim community seems to have a few gripes with this game it's simple physics and the fact that using certain driving aids such as traction control makes you faster as well as rather flat FFB feel. While they have improved the FFB to make it more lively it pales in comparison to sim titles such as AC or iRacing making it much harder to judge what the car is doing. Part of what makes those titles feel so real is the FFB and its direct feeling that F1 titles have yet to achieve.That said this game offers one of the most complete packages. What it lacks in simulated physics it makes up for with great AI, a career mode that makes you feel like a real F1 driver put under the stresses of performing (improved further with the previous point about the harder AI). It has a nice progression feel with its tech tree making you feel excited to test out the latest upgrade package to see what edge it gives.Simulations offer realism in terms of handling, tyre physics, car physics in the case of iRacing laser scanned tracks that are pinpoint accurate. But most of these games are built around the idea of short races or hot lapping etc leaving larger races to be done in private leagues. F1 2017 nails what racing is like, letting you sit down and experience it anytime you like, you have to manage your fuel. Pit strategy can change instantly as a safety car comes out. You can be left with your pants down after pushing to hard early and burning up your tyres. All this plus also having to really think about how your manage your four power units in the racing year and what upgrades will be the best for your teams current position. Its that tense that I seriously do my own out-lap and in-lap to make sure the car is not being over worked... Its extremely fun.F1 2017 is not a simulation, yet it offers the most realistic racing scenarios around and has me coming back every day for another race. It might not have the physics of the sims such as AC & iRacing but all that quickly melts away when you turn the AI up to the point it will really tests you and you try and make it as a formula 1 driver, the pressure is real, the thrill is like no other and shiz gets real when it starts to rain. F1 2017 is the best and most complete formula 1/racing game to date!"

Something I really like about 2017, other than the classic F1 cars which is awesome, is as of now I use a 360 controller and in 2016 I had the traction control on medium but now since the 2017 cars have wider tires, codemasters did a good job transferring this over to the game. Now I can play with traction control off.Anyone that played 2016, if you like that game, your going to really like this one."

,Recommended,515220,34490074,Posted: 25 August,all,sequence_9,"Well done Codemasters. It is an amazing game. I'd like to start with handling. For me it is a big improvement over 2016. Cars are much more responsive and traction is amazing. It is easy drive and be consistent, but hard to master. It feels like cornering and breaking are more important in 2017.  I am also using a pad and I think there are some imrovements on that too. I can feel the car. It wasn't the case in 2016 and controls were stresful for me.Dynamic weather is amazing. You can feel every stage of curcuit. Transition between wet and dry is slower and more realistic.Career mode has been improved a lot. It is so much fun. This game feels like a whole package. Everything I love about f1 is in there. Racing and strategy...For me the only con of the game its A.I again. Although there are improvements on that and its feels amazing. It lacks personalities. I mean it feels like there is one type of driver and only difference is its pace. In the future,  I'd like to see some drivers being more agressive or some rivalries going on between them too for example. A.I's pit strategies are also generic, nothing special or unique. That being said, it feels nothing like in 2016. It is so much fun race with this improved A.I.Overall it is an amazing game. Racing, strategy, r&d, management, unique story lines... Like I said it is a complete package. Don't miss it, I highly recommend it."

I think everyone would be angry if their fun is ruined for the next 10 minutes multiple times because they got severe wing damage because some moron doesn't know how to drive at 100 mph.And they reset multiplayer levels even though that wasn't glitched, only the statistics were... issues are being prioritized that shouldn't be. Maybe they should fix the people that waste everyone's time never connecting to the game, but no, it's more important to fix statistics...The multiplayer mode - specifically public matchmaking, the only way to get levels - is trash, time trial mode is glitchy, everything else is acceptable.Multiplayer is so bad... you have to wait up to 10 minutes for one person to connect before you can start or end a race. Whoever doesn't connect in 20 seconds should be auto-kicked, and whoever doesn't connect fully at the end of the race should get auto-kicked after they get their xp. It also switched my car between the qualifier and the race, which made me go from 1st place to DNFing. The races themselves are even bad. The penalties are not strict at all for collisions, so your race could be ended on the first turn by a complete moron and they walk away with a just a warning in ALL situations, no matter what.Also, I couldn't even get into a game recently because public matchmaking is just horrible. I bet it was contionously trying to put me into a game with the server/host on the complete opposite side of the world. I bet there is no prioritization based on ping. It should not take up to thirty minutes to get into a game, especially because there are a lot of players.I crashed while loading the event too, just because I pressed ""Start"".In conclusion, this game has so many broken ""features"" that its embarassing.

You now feel the road effects (even had to turn them down a bit) and really have that ""gritty"" feeling better sims give you. It's not up to par with AC, Iracing or Automobilista, but it comes really close.- AI is really agressive, i like it. Even on 50% difficulty it is pretty hard to win a (short) race coming from last starting position just because overtaking is so hard. Random divebombing will result in crashes. The AI also tries to overtake you again as soon as you leave the corner and will bump you if you drive like a♥♥♥♥♥♥ And yes i drove like a♥♥♥♥♥♥:)-  The classic cars really feel different. Only downside is that the older cars need some adjustment on the FFB imo, it felt way too strong, even when i already tuned down the settings on the modern cars (playing with a t-300).

Some great additions this year with components, engine wear etc.- Visuals are fantastic in general.- The game mechanics are still very good. Not perfect. But certainly extremely enjoyable to play!- Tracks look and feel spot on.- Classic Cars are a cool addition. Didn't think I'd enjoy them much, but they are a nice bonus element to the game, especially with the classic car events such as: pursuit, overtake challenges, checkpoint races etc.- Championships look a lot of fun as well, but i haven't had the time to dive into that yet - career and online for me so far.- Menu's and layout all seem to be very accessible and polished.- Great community.Cons:- Online. Year after year this just seems to be a very neglected area. Why no dedicated servers? It's 2017, and games such as this - it shouldn't even be a second thought. Especially now the game is being promoted so heavily by F1 itself and is now entering the realms of eSports.- AI. Yes it's improved, but there's still a few things that drive (pun intended) me crazy. Get off the racing line ffs in qualifying on out laps. Stop looking like the Human Centipede in corners on the first lap.- Rules. Yes the rules are correct, but their implementation at times, is a disaster. Heading into the chicane at Monaco, get shunted through, cop a penalty for cutting the corner. Argh what? How about no? Get squeezed to the outside of the track because Jolyon Palmer didn't bring his guide to F1 book and do all you can to avoid a collision correctly, then cop a penalty for exceeding track limits.What I'd love to see in the future:- Pastor Maldonado mode.- A 100% complete game.- Expanded career.- Online career's or a much much more in-depth online championship mode.- Dedicated servers for online.- Ability to run leagues in game - with many more customisable options.- Some actual F1 videos of drivers doing the tracks and giving their tips.- Damage model updated to be more realistic.If I see the Halo in game for 2018 for T-Cam view.

,Recommended,515220,34914147,Posted: 12 September,all,Papa Bless,"TL;DRUnlike McLaren Honda, this game isn't a complete disappointment. Career mode is a direct upgrade from last years, especially since RnD is no longer a gimmick. Online feels neglected, but the classic cars are a nice touch and provide some much needed extra content. Overall, this game has more replayability than 2016, and feels more polished.My spielScroll down for pros and consAfter years and years of disappointment, Codemasters have finally published a title that does F1 justice.  I have been a fan of F1 since the 2012 season, and started playing the Codemasters games since 2013. Year after year the games kept getting worse. F1 2016 was a breath of fresh air, but still not the title that I was looking for. The career mode was heavily hyped, but the car development was just a gimmick.When F1 2017 came out this year, I was skeptical. I did not pre-order it, breaking the 4 year chain of pre-ordering f1 games. After seeing a couple of positive reviews, I paid the premium price and so far I have not regretted it one bit. The cars are much more exciting to drive than they have been on previous games, and the career mode progression finally feels realistic. For me, its the small details that make this game better than all the previous f1 games. F1 2016 had a great  feel on track, but the menus and controls were a mess. This year, it feels like Codies have actually put in some effort into every aspect.Pros-Career ModeCareer mode finally feels progressive and realistic. The practice programs have expanded, giving them more relevance. You really need the resource points for car development this year. The R n D feels great this year. The resource tree gives you the ability to upgrade certain elements of your car that might be lacking in performance. Unlike 2016, each car you drive will have different needs. A McLaren Honda will need a lot of work on the engine, while a Williams will need a lot of chassis work done. The classic car events are a nice deviation from your standard career mode, although putting them right after a race can make them tedious, especially after you just finished an 100% race at Monaco.-The RacingThe handling model keeps getting better and better every year. The cars this year are much faster, making them much more fun to drive. The AI has been tweaked this year, and is much more aggressive. They are still quite dumb, but it is an upgrade over 2017. Codies have also implemented manual clutch on pitstops as well as the pit limiter for entering the pits. It really doesnt change much at all, but I like it.-Classic CarsGlad they are back. Really enjoyed them in F1 2013, really enjoying them now. Nice to have a more modern selection of ""classics""-WeatherFinally, Codies has given us a more unpredictable weather system. There is no longer a clear crossover point in between dry and wet. This year you will actually need to think about when to come in to change compounds, and you might get it wrong.-The Small DetailsThe menu is cleaner, it is somewhat easier to map controls, Loading screens have some pictures now, not just a boring white screen, AI now has a difficulty slider (THANK GOD)Cons-AIWhile the aggressiveness of the AI makes them more racey, they still can be quite stupid at times. The AI really likes to park it on the racing line in qualifying, which is really annoying when you are on a fast lap.-Licensing IssuesWhile we have classic cars, we don't have the historic driver names.-BugsCould have been a bit more polished, quite a few glitches and bugs. I got boosted up 10 places while on the formation lap for no reason.-OnlineStill neglected-Strictness on ModsThis has been a big problem since 2015. Before, you could mod the games. Custom helmets, liveries and championships used to add a huge amount of replayability. Every year, Codemasters have made it harder and harder to mod the game files. This is a huge disappointment."

,Recommended,515220,34490525,Posted: 25 August,all,Cozzie,"If you are looking for a serious review, I hope you listen up.This new installment has thus far expanded on the one giant leap Codemasters took on F1 2016 after falling rock bottom a year earlier. It maybe hasn't took a giant leap of it's own, but maybe put both feet further up. After exploring all the game's new features I find this an enhanced F1 2016.R&DLet's talk Career Mode. Last year Codemasters mainly focused on bringing Career back up to Earth per se, whilst adding the new R&D section to actual feel that you could have took that Manor car to glory, as demonstrated by the one and only Benjamin Daly. This year, they have built upon that foundation, including over 100+ Upgrades to put on the car, covering all different aspects such as Aero, Chassis and the main Engine itself. At first it may seem a bit daunting for a casual player, and it did to me, but when you could have took the Sauber from last to first within 2 seasons last year due to the small amount of upgrades available, this year it will feel more of a reward when you and Paschal (hopefully you picked him) are challenging the Ferraris and the Mercedes in Season 4/5 after trying so hard to build up those resource points for a few seasons now. Another cool feature about the R&D is that some potential upgrades that you apply could actually fail, giving the game a bit more realism, as well as not making every upgrade available for the next race. Overall, it's one of the main things Codies wanted to improve from last year and they have done well, 8.5/10.Engine ProblemsOne of my big problems with F1 2016 was how AI were extremely exposed to engine failures, something I would have expreienced 2 maybe 3 times every race, WITHOUT ME GETTING ANY.However, Codies have soorted this out by not only making us vulnerable to engine failures as well, but also adding more depth by forcing us to check on each engine part. As in real life, each driver is given 4 engines to use over the course of the year, and if one fails, they must use another one with the punishment of a penalty. This is the same in game, which is really nice to see, making us more involved during a race to see if there is any risk of a particular part failing. And of course, in the trailer showcasing this they used Mclaren, props all to Codies for that. 8.5/10.AIThe AI in this game seem very similar to F1 2016 something that might bugger some players. The AI never really go for unnecessary overtakes, and as a whole can be quite cautious. However they will stick their nose down the inside if given a chance. Unfortunately, from what I've heard the *glitch* which causes the AI to stick to their position coming into the pits even if another car is still there still remains, which did annoy me a little bit on F1 2016. The grid order seems very realistic, with Mercedes and Ferrari dominating most races, with Red Bull close behind, then the midfield bunch followed by the Mclaren's and Saubers.As a whole though, the AI are decent, not awful (like they were on old generation), but definitely something Codies might want to improve on for F1 2018. 6/10.CustomisationLast year Codies enabled us to choose our own avatar, helmet and number, something that I liked, but something I hated say if i didn't like my helmet, as I has to restart all over again. This year, we are now able to change our helmet, avatar and number as many times as you want, as well as unlocking number 1 by winning the championship. All helmets remain the same, apart from the new competition winners that are new. Some of them look ok, but none of them are customisable which kinda sucks, because a few have cool designs. You can also have female avatars as well, so if for some reason you want to change sex before Spa feel free. Overrall, it's better but not great. 7/10.Drivers/AnimationsNow, where to start. One of Codies weak points are their ability to make good animations. Since F1 2015, where they started showing the driver's faces and added podium animations, it's been one of my negatives of the F1 games, same with 2017. I can definitely see improvements to some driver's faces, for example Hulkenburg, Kyvat and Verstappen all look a lot better, but the same can't be said for others. Most drivers look creepy as ♥♥♥♥ and some look nothing like their real life counter parts. Idk what they did to Lewis Hamilton but what they did wasn't good. Also whilst I'm at it, I'll mention podiums as well, something that changed as well, not for the good nor for the bad. One complaint I have is that all drivers get the same podium animations for winning, something we know doesn't happen irl. One hope for the future is that Codies make the drivers have more diverse personalities, not like they are all controlled by the same robot, just with the drivers faces planted on them. As mentioned in WTF1's Review, imagine Ricciardo doing a shoey, Hamilton throwing his trophy in the air or even Kimi just looking really miserable dispite winning a race, now that would be awesome. 4/10.Classic CarsSince F1 2013, when Codies added Classic Cars into the game, I've been dying for Codies to put them back in at some point, and in F1 2017, they finally did it, to my delight. All of the cars are awesome to drive, two in particular being the MP4-4 (obvs) and the dominant Ferrari F2004. Another really cool feature they implemented into Career Mode involve these cars, where you meet Jonathon who invites you to invitational events were you take on different events in different cars, something I feel is awesome and something I did not see coming at all. 9/10.OnlineOnline Multiplayer we all know won't be perfect, as it is with any other Online game. A cool feature that Codies have added is the 2 slots for spectators to watch, something that will definitely come in handy for League Racing. Apart from that, most things look the same, I would need to wait and see as to how much Aliens have landed onto Earth to bug into the game, but until then, a solid 6/10 will do.ChampionshipsAnother main problem I had woth F1 2016 was with the lack of offline choices. You had Career Mode, Championship Mode, Quick Race and Time Trial. 2 of which I barely touched. Now in 2017, Codies have added additional Championships, adding to the depth this game has to offer. Some use Classic Cars, some use Modern, but if you are feeling bored of Career Mode, which I hope you don't, then these are your alternate routes. 7.5/10.GraphicsAs usual, the game doesn't fail to disappoint with the looks. It's very similar to F1 2016's, but I just think it's better. Maybe something to do with the shaders, as anything at sunset is glorious. The cars look cool, maybe a liitle bit abovve the ground but I'm ok with that. Obviously they are using the Melbourne versions of the cars so the graphics are different to what we will see at Spa this weekend, but an early patch to fix it up will be fine and dandy. 7.5/10HandlingI don't use a wheel, sorry guys. As for people with pads (on body or a controller), the imput lag is way less noticeable this year, which is always nice. Also, if you have been using traction control on full, it might be an idea to switch to medium, as I think it's way easier to control the car. Apart from that, decent, 7/10.PriceBeing £45 seems expensive for aa game, but actually if you compare it to the likes of FIFA 18 and COD:WW2, it's a reasonable price for a game which is vastly expanded from last year. The amount of content it contains will leave you with something to do for a good while, so for a die-hard F1 fan this is a must buy. For the casual viewer though, the choice is all yours, buy now or wait a few months until it goes on sale, and then buy it then.7/10.Other things to mention:Monaco at night - 10/10.Both Mclaren's retired in the first race (for me at least) - 10/10,IntoTheBarrier was top of the leaderboards at something - 0/10.Overall: 8.2/10 Recommended."

I was dissapointed that progress towards making a more polished game was not happening so from F1 2013 until F1 2016 I did not support CodeMasters products. I decided that this year however I would give them another shot. The game, from the outside, looks much better and the handling of car physics has met that nice balance of sim versus arcade. It is still absolutely closer to the realm of arcade but it will most likely please even sim nuts who just want a purpose build F1 game.However...I still see bugs and issues in the game that were present in F1 2012. First off, the safety car can still cause wrecks. The ""please use multiple tire compounds"" bug that will DSQ you even when you do use both compounds still happens in online races. Speaking of online races, have they made...ANY progress on making this experience better? No matter where your opponents live on this planet, you are going to get a super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ connection race. It is really hard to take it seriously when the other racing games on PC have miles upon miles of better experiences.Looking at other PC racing games/sims, where in the hell is VR support? You had it in Dirt Rally and now you just abandon it? I get the the PC market is niche but look at almost every other PC racing game and what do you see? VR support.If you are looking for a single player experience, then sure F1 2017 can scratch that itch. However it is still a buggy experience and without VR it feels like a bad value against other racing games on PC. I cannot recommend this game unless you do not have last year's version. If you have any previous version, stick with that."

All the cars feel terrific to drive, and getting behind the wheel of a v12 F1 car from the 90's alone makes F1 2017 worthwhile.As of the creation of this review, the ratings for the game are at 85%, and I suspect that the remaining 15% dislikes come from various bugs. I still recommend this game because I haven't run into any joy-depriving moments. The biggest issue I've had is when the game refuses to save practice data between playing sessions. Some completed 'programmes' during the practice session of a race may be lost after saving, closing the game, and firing it up later. I ran across this in F1 2016, and it was never fixed. However, this did not keep me from playing that game, and won't keep me from this new one.As for multiplayer, I haven't tried it and don't intend to for awhile.If you're worried about the 15% or so, wait for the game to be patched at least once."

,Recommended,515220,34509172,Posted: 26 August,all,porojussi,"First impression - Magnificent!The game runs very smoothly, driving feels great and it's filled with different modes and activities. Legendary cars feels and sound amazing; The last time i got the same kind of chills was when first playing the new Doom as i did with driving a 2004 Ferrari throught Eau Rouge. (Regarless of hitting the wall immediately..)I play with an Xbox controller, and albeit being very sensitive by default, it feels really good once you get the gist of it.+ Career mode- You get so much options with the developement of you car and the team that it makes buying Motorsport Manager worthless. I started my career with Mclaren, and after 3 practise sessions and Q1 my Internal Combustion Engine was already 86% used. So a plus for realism. My teammate retired on the first race because of an engine failure...+ AI- I've been playing with almost expert difficulty, and the AI difficulty seems very good, there are no massive gaps between teams like there used to be on older F1-games. A little minus for AI tho: Vettel kept ramming my rear end on straights even though he could've easily just go around me.+ Graphics- The cutscenes and misc. are not the main part of the game, but even they are so well done that you have to stop and admire them for a while. While racing, the cars look really good too.+ Strategy- There's so much micromanagement to do with your fuel, tires, engine etc. that it really makes this game a gem. Everything feels linear, and you get immediate feedback if you improve on these fields. Really rewarding.+ The lady who keeps telling me stuff has a nice butt- Multiplayer-I'm sure that it's just because there's not very many players yet, but i tried to get into an online game for a good 15min, and when i finally got to a lobby and went into a race, the game froze on the loading screen. Dunno if it's the servers or the Host's internet, but it just kept loading until i shut down the game.Overally a solid 9.5/10.  (-0,5 points for the online issues and the fact that Kimi seemed pleased on the podium after finishing 2nd)EDIT: Fixing grammatical errors. I'm a bit tipsy while writing this."

76561198042501819,Recommended,515220,34719828,Posted: 3 September,all,abhinn124,"So, F1 2017 is definiteley a step up from 2016 in many aspects.The new improved career mode is much more in-depth and tries to follow all the current FIA regulations i.e. pertaining to the use of power unit components, gearbox,etc. This does add a certain autheticity to the game.The addition of various other game modes such as the one which presents you with random scenarios are very welcome not to mention the classic events.The other thing that has been improved and which I think not a lot of people will notice at first is that the circuits are represented very realistically, meaning they have all the bumps and embankments that you'd find on the real circuits(especially Silverstone, Suzuka, Austria).The support for both wheel and controller has also been marginally improved. FFB on a racing wheel is a challenge and a delight whereas the support for rumble triggers and very good vibration feedback on the XBOne controller is much appreciated.The game does well to show how the new 2017 cars handle and corner. You can brake later but have to be very precise and  you can also get  back on the power a lot earlier which does make driving these new cars a lot more fun since you get a feeling of pushing harder than ever before. The vintage cars on the other hand are a whole other story which I'll get back to later, though I do have to admit and admire the way they sound and look.Now coming to the bad part.The game itself has a number of issues and seems rushed. There have been many instances when the entire grid started on a Dry tyre in Wet weather conditions and nothing seemed to matter. And while we are on that subject, driving in the wet is a joke. Its easier than it was in F1 2013 whereas 2016 seemed far more legitimate. The driving model as a whole seems a step back from 2016 which does take away a lot of the authenticity. Driving all the vintage cars is a piece of cake and all of them drive almost exactly the same which is a big disappointment because a lot of people were excoted to test them out(I know I was!).Now coming to the graphics which let me tell you are worse than 2016 and by some margin. CODIES - Using a filter does not necessarily improve the looks of the game. Graphics in the wet are also very bad. Both the track and the cars look way worse than before in the wet. There also seems to be a contrast issue present in the game which makes all the cars look a lot more whiter which no amount of tweaking could solve.In the end, I would like to say that I would definitely recommend this game. I just wish the vintage cars drove uniquely and the graphics were better. F1 and Codies have come a long way."

From the ancient V6 turbo fury of the MP4/4 to the Grid Penalty Happy Epic Fail Hybrid that is the MCL-32...and of course a Legendary V12 that gave a Legendary driver his Title#3.Next: Plot twist!

Welcome Aboard the Ferrari Hypetrain(wreck?)Next: Bwoah the Iceman Cometh! Kimi Raikkonen, our loveable icecream man turns back the clock for suddenly his AI here is somewhat like during his prime time from 2005-2007ish, a nice touch indeed.Next: That Kvyat guy! this Torpedo boy is guaranteed laser-guided to give you a wonderful wreck of a race, BEWARE!Next: Physics! 2016 gave an easy-peasy guide to overtake and has that cutesy understeer because its reality, come 2017 these cars are wid-er, aggressiv-er, fast-er and a lot of ""ER"" that it gives you the straight facts overtakes are hard-er, battles are brutal-er, and if you aint careful-er, the rear could dare to throw you off the gutt-er...coz its reality, broth-er!Last: E-Sports! Now the community is somewhat bitter why this pc port is harder to mod, simply because codies wants us to enjoy a LESS hackable environment so they can roll-in official game events(which only PS/XB consolers are entitled last time) here on steam and bring in the real hardcore racers who are under the pc master race, and enjoy the game more by plain competence. Get it? So start training, join the E-Sport Army, Private!The only ones they really missed are 3 things: Updated liveries with those easy-to-see driver numbers(imagine that with your own number!), that much anticipated BRAWN GP BGP001 that never happened, and will only happen in fairy tales(or make a wish to the fairy F1 Group godfather Ross Brawn), and of course our fingerboy Vettel's BLACK PUMA GLOVES that has been around since melbourne.

After downloading nvidia's latest drivers however I'm happy to report that the crashing has become far less frequent, it should be noted however it has not stopped entirely. The game does still crash from time to time. But if you get into the habit of using the ""save mid-session"" feature then these infrequent crashes become more of an inconvenience than a total deal breaker. I'm glad that I can change this review to recommended because now that I can play the game for more than 15 minutes at a time I've gone from liking it, to loving it.The cars feel more stable than 2016, and they look amazing in my opinion. Especially from behind (where I unfortunately spend a lot of my time), the wider track just looks so low and planted. The addition of classic cars is also very welcome. They each feel distinct and have noticeably different handling characteristics. The ability to utilise an H-pattern shifter with the old cars is also very nice, however the shifting doesn't feel perfect. Still a blast driving through Monaco in an MP4/4. The older cars are well-integrated into the career mode and really break up the somewhat monotonous, weekend-after-weekend grind of earlier F1 20xx's.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase, the addition of classics already won me over but all the smaller additions like the expanded R&D custimization and extra free-practice programs really make this worth my money. Crashes are annoying to be sure but I can live with infrequent ones. Whether or not you could tolerate them is up to you, however if you can I think you are rewarded with the best modern F1 game.P.S: who knows, maybe they'll patch it."

Was very excited to play and make Renault a top team again but its impossible to do when you get disqualified because of bugs and other issues with the safety car. Race after race when the safety car comes out it causes so many issues resulting in cars crashing into the safety car and drivers getting penalties for no reason. Example was in P2 at Spain in the Renault on 100 difficulty (Legend) and safety car gets called out received 3 drive through penalties and ended up finishing the race P13. This means I lose my rivalries, I get less resource points and I lose reputation with other teams. Codemasters, please fix your game and don't just focus on Youtubers and your eSports championship, please can we just get a game that actually works without issues. Don't even get me started on the multiplayer problems."

Getting a game going is difficult (there are not many players and the matchmaking doesn't give you many options. most of the time it will put you into a group mid race and if you try to exit and choose matchmaking again, you'll end up in the same group again), half the time the game then crashes and otherwise, if you do finish the race, a bug on release means that everyone gets disqualified. They should have sorted this bug out before releasing.- It is difficult to work out what is a good difficulty level, the game should have some mode to test skill levels and recommend something. On the default difficulties you'll be winning races in a Sauber."

On release it worked fine for me, but as soon as they released patch 1.5 it wouldn't open at all for a full day, and when it did finally open and I ran a race, the game crashed within the first 10 seconds of running it. Patch 1.6 rolls around and now I can't even drive....I use an Xbox one controller to drive because I dont have a steering wheel. This worked fine until just recently; as soon as I boot up the game it starts rapidly scrolling sideways as if i had the stick pulled to the side, but it isn't in the same direction. Going through the menues it'll change as i try to move it, making the menus impossible to navigate. Went into a race, and as soon as it started it drove me into a wall... I tried changing controllers, didn't work. Tried restarting the game, didn't work.I am kinda annoyed I bought a broken game at full price.Now for the good bits that actually make this game worth anything. It has a rather good imersion level, needing to run qualifyings and practice runs before the actual race. If your computer has Tobii Eye Tracking, it actually has the ability to use that. Needing to watch my fuel usage and how much I take onto the track is a lovely experience, as well as needing to worry about engine wear too. The story mode is quite fun, I've taken on Ferrari as my team, and race with Vettle. I greatly enjoyed getting to run Monico at night and Monza right after watching the real F1 racers run it. I think it would be great if they'd add the Nerburgring in as well, though I might just not have seen it yet.All in all, it has the potential to be one of the best racing games ever, if it didn't have so many bugs and glitches. Fix everything and it would be perfect."

,Recommended,515220,34612408,Posted: 30 August,all,Hopeless,"Many people say that F1 2017 is a reskin of the previous game but it really isn't.  The handling especially when using a controller feels more measured.  It's not snapping at me and you can get a good sense of when the tires are beginning to slip.  The increased mechanical grip and downforce is felt quite readily.  I have to also say I was glad to find that it supports the Xbox trigger impulse vibration which not many games do readily which also helps you guage how close to the limit you are. You feel like you can really attack in the corners now.  You cannot really compare this game to Project Cars, Forza or any other big named racing game.  F1 is quite niche and what is here, is done well in realtion to the sport.Graphics wise is a bit of a mixed bag.  There has been an update to the track surfaces, the grass and gravel traps as well as the building especially in Baku however there are a few things that are distracting.  There is no option to run SMAA or MSAA now.  There is only temporal filtering which should make objects that are in motion look better - here it doesn't.  Combine that with the motion blur, it looks like a real smudgy affair at mid to high speeds.  I feel that there is also something off with the lighting which I am guessing due to the HDR compatability.  I don't run a HDR monitor (it's good a great contrast ratio though) to see whether the blown out highlights are due to this.   I feel that maybe reworking the anti aliasing for a sharper image is in need here.The career feels more in depth and from the outset, there is more of a sense that you should invest wisely in upgrades (as the parts can fail in development now) and the immersion factor of interacting with the other characters feels much more lifelike compared to the previous games.  The computer AI feels a lot better as well.  I typically run the difficulty medium to highest and the AI does actually push you on higher levels.  They also tend to be more aggressive as numerous times I have been run off the road or battled with the leaders.  Yes there is an issue with the parts wear but I have to admit that I drive quite smoothly most of the time so don't have too many problems myself, but it is something that needs to be balanced as many have cried out for it.  The system itself is a great addition as it does make you think a little more strategically about how you are going to race.  Are you going to go flat out and risk a part (or three) failing or are you going to play it safe at the cost of research points and your place in the driver standings.There are a lot of positives but it echos what I said about Dirt 4.  It is a great start and although F1 doesn't lack as noticably in terms of content (like Dirt), there are bugs, glitches and apparent oversights that a quick look on the community hub will show.  My faith in the devs is being tested but the game on the whole is/will be fantastic once those bugs are sorted!"

The game either looks like a pixelated mess or like your screen has been smeared in vaseline with no in-between. Turning motion blur off in game and DOF off in a config file does not seem to help muchCareer mode part durability is horribly broken if you play on anything less than 100% race distance. My power unit was at 64% wear after only one weekend on 25% length.Scripted AI practice/qualifying times. What they physically do is of no consequence because at the end of the session they will be give a time with in preset parameters. For example a dry laptime when clearly the conditions are wet.Online mode is unplayable. DQ'ing whole fields, ghosting, etc.Modding the game prevents you from saving. This also means no custom liveries, names, whatever.No mouse support in the menus. Sweet console port bro.OverallUpdated 08/31/2017As of today and the 1.5 patch the issues with career mode and 25% race length have been fixed. No longer will your ICE/Gearbox be dead after 2 races. This was the most important issue for me, as career mode is where I spend 90% of my time.Sure, there are other issues that persist but they are not game breaking the way they were as of a couple days ago. The graphic issues are annoying but they do not ruin the core gameplay or experience. The scripted AI qualifying times are also a pain but they do not destroy the game, they just make you have to work a bit harder during the race since getting pole is difficult.I am changing my review from not recommended to a soft recommeded (this is when a star system would be nice).

76561198042993114,Recommended,515220,34508203,Posted: 26 August,all,Patrick,"Career mode has been massively expanded, and it is amazing (because really, who plays multiplayer with all the nufty's and trolls?). It even includes mid-season challenges that you can drive the classic cars in - so if you've only got time for career mode play you will get to do some 3 or 5 lap challenges with classic cars.There are more management aspects to the game - you need to manage engine components, gearboxes, and still do enough practice as to complete R&D challenges for research points. I still don't feel there is anywhere near enough complexity (i.e. let's see some in game financial currency as well as the R&D, sponsors events, individual skills, public relations, etc.); and it's hard to know what direction / upgrades even that the AI teams have and are developing in as it is only displayed via a bar-graph.Racing has been improved and the 2017 cars are much more fun to drive. AI seem to go through pace phases and also appear to be affected by fuel saving, engine saving and trye wear (my experiences, not facts stated by the devs). The undercut & overcut sometimes work, but it's definitely not a game breaker - and the game seems to be much more sensitive to lift & coast and protecting tyres than ever before.Gone are the days where running ""normal"" fuel mode will see you finish with +2 laps of fuel; you'll need to be managing it the whole race & are often praying for a safety car. However, there are also consequences for running lean fuel; you'll chew through your energy storage reliability quickly if using it too much! Running the full 5 laps of the race pace strat is all the more worth it on higher difficulties to make sure you've got the perfect tyre and fuel strategy.AI teams by the end of the season will be taking penalties for components / gearboxes too. I seem to recall that these factors haven't really been imposed much on AI in previous games, but it is very prevalent in this year's game and in the last race of season 1 I was promoted from 11th to 1st after penalties.I found that I could get all of the durability upgrades within 1 season, which kind of made season 2  too easy (6 races in and I'm still using the same engine components & gearbox, and it looks like they could go another 5 race weekends) - but I am grateful for all of the 120-odd potential upgrade choices (some are purely points, some are experience based).I'm loving this year's game, and am already looking forward to next year. But here's a few directions I'd love to see them expand into...- I'd love to see some individual driver skills / traits - when creating a driver are you a tyre protector, a quali specialist, a race specialist, a wet weather master, or just a plain Jane all-rounder?- Would also like to see durability upgrade effects reduced slightly.- A few more options for team roles which are less linear would be great (i.e. more than just ""1st driver"", ""2nd driver"") - how about some ""rear gunner"" Kimi style, a ""selfless"" support driver like Bottas, an ""experienced old hand"" in Massa - helping develop a teammate / provide setups / they get the upgrades first, or even ""fiesty but team-focused inter-team battle"" like the current RBR lineup where the Drivers World Championship is unattainable and so they focus on the Constructors World Championship, and the obvious ""Championship contender"" roles?- Some more interactivity with the other teams as far as R&D, you know, media speculation reports / photos, etc. showing the player what the rest of the field is 'suspected ' of working on, would be great.- This whole thing could be tied together better with some story telling. You've got a couple of commentators who provide very generic pre-session comments, a couple of random AI characters who give very bland and generic scripted info; but there is no personality to it. I'd love to see Codemasters collaborate with the new F1 owners (as they've flagged massive changes to things like social media access, driver access, etc.) or even SkySports to bring about some more personality and stories as the season progresses. Development corner? Paddock rumours & gossip?TL;DR -This is a great game. If you liked the direction CM went in 2016, but don't want as much managerial control as F1 Manager - buy this game. If the price is a bit too much, grab it in the half-yearly Steam sales. You won't regret it."

E.g. a minor engine upgrade gives 5hp to a top-end merc engine and the same 5hp to Honda's lawnmower. With all upgrades applied across all cars all cars are exactly where they start. Forget about McLarens goal of returning to winning ways if you race at a diff that is your appropriate one.No post-launch content updates seem to be planned. All tracks from Monza onwards are filled with placeholder 'F1 2017' ads. Coming out of Parabolica and seeing a sea of yellow and black F1 generic logos is jarring, to say the least. On top of that initial team rankings and car models are based off pre-season testing. Merc has been running a new front section for a while now but as of Spa and Monza it is still missing from the game. You can't mod these things in as this seems to break save functionality.Still the same old tired setup options of 1-11 on most everything... Modern F1 cars provide huge amounts of telemetry, why not give absolute freedom in setup, and provide more and more accurate data on the cars sweet spot for the track as you turn laps in practice sessions?The AI is very clearly scripted in all sessions except the race. How is it that I qualify 19th in a McLaren in Spa, then charge up the field in the opening laps and keep hold of P6 until the very end?Overall this game is good, its got a fair bit of features, but the features that are there lack polish, sadly. It's neither a hardcore sim like Asseto Corsa or iRacing nor does it celebrate motoring in the way a Forza game might. I don't think I'm going to play much past two seasons, as I plan to join a top team for S2 and be done with it after that. Hopefully by that time Forza 7 will be out."

In my opinion, no. It has less teams, graphics are an improvement on most but then wheel animations are poor. People claim better handling with more grip then unrealistic driving at speeds around some tracks. At last, finally female avatars but it is the same faces for NPC team, and the same commentary quotes, and the same engine noises. Wind noise is a positive addition.The only marked improvements are, classic cars, better R&D, difficulty sliders, and short track option. As for multiplayer, I never had issues with 2016's online racing not that I did much of it. 2017 is claimed to be an improvement although watching others race while in the lobby everyone seemed to get disqualified for leaving the track which seemed rather harsh to me so I never even bothered to race, as such I cannot comment on whether the multiplayer experience is better or not.If you do not own a F1 racing game and are looking to buy then this is your game.

Career mode expansion is the big one this time around, with a vastly expanded R&D system with 115 parts to be developed will mean an at minimum 6-7 season career to get them depending on starting team. The actual development programs that run during practise have been expanded and improved upon to be a much more satisfying experience too. The handling feels about the same as 2016 but obviously with more grip through the corners as per this years regulation changes, one small thing I have noticed is the vibration coming through the force feedback on my wheel are much more powerful than before. Almsot as important as the career mode improvements is the AI this year, so much more agressive at overtaking and defending position without just simply ramming the player. Had an epic 12 lap battle with Alonso in Australia where positions changed 5-6 times but at no point did we hit each other!

76561197972409682,Recommended,515220,34473878,Posted: 24 August,all,Grug,"*** EARLY IMPRESSIONS - NOT FULL REVIEW ***These impressions are designed for people who have played F1 2016 and want to know if it is worth the upgrade.First up, the car handling. It is so much more fun to play than F1 2016 - largely due to updating the driving model to match the new technical specifications in the 2017 season. We've heard the real life drivers say how fun the new spec is to drive, and that is certainly represented in the game. You realise pretty quickly that you can carry considerably more speed into corners, as well as push the car harder when exiting. It really has more of a ""hold your breath"" sense of dare when you aggressively attack corners and I have caught myself giggling a few times when a daring maneuver pays off. That said, you still have to learn the limits of your car or you will be punished for taking it over the limit.Secondly, performance. (For reference I have an i3 6100, 16gb of DDR4 ram, Radeon RX 480 8gb GPU, 256gb m2 SSD, Logitech G29 wheel). For some reason, F1 2016 always threw random frame rate drops at me, regardless of what graphical settings I was using. I'd be coasting along at 85 FPS and then suddenly the frame rate would drop for a second to the sub 50s, which affected my driving performance. I was desperately hoping that this would be fixed in F1 2017. And it has! The game not only looks better than last year, but it also seems to look better while not decreasing the performance compared to F1 2016 and most importantly, the random frame rate drops are gone. I'm so happy about this. It's smooth as silk.Thirdly, career mode. I put plenty of hours into career mode last year, and while it was great, it was crying out for expanded depth. I've only done one 50 percent length GP for Haas so far, as well as the first invitiational event, but I can already see that they have injected it with more life and depth. The tech tree looks seriously cool, and you are really going to be able to develop a car over the long run that suits your particular driving style. The invitiational event was also a nice little distraction, and it was great to drive (and hear the roar of) a V8 classic). They aren't just reskinned cars, the driving experience is very different, and very fun.My biggest gripe with F1 2016 was the difficulty settings. I (and many others) quickly found myself stranded between two difficulty levels (e.g. expert too easy & master too hard) and it was impossible to find a middle ground that provided a challenging but fair racing experience. I am thrilled to say that Codemasters have listened to the feedback and provided a 1-100 difficulty sliding scale that allows fine-tuning. It only took me a couple of free practice sessions to find my perfect challenge level and as a result, my first grand prix provided a very fun and competitive midfield race as you would expect from a Haas car this season. Of all he great changes Codemasters have made this year, this is oddly the one that I am most happy about. Such a small tweak makes all the difference.So to answer my point at the start of the review... is it worth the upgrade from 2016. YES! YES! YES!If Codies put this much love into the 2018 edition, I will happily upgrade again!P.S. Forza Ferrari this weekend in Spa!"

The new R&D system and limited amount of power units makes career mode more enjoyable. Handling wise apart from higher speeds and downforce the cars feel the same as 2016 which is ok i guess. Already got bumped by Kvyat so realism must be excellent.The bad: A lot has been imported straight from 2016; intro's, commentary, MFD and a lot of other things. The biggest disappointment for me is setting up the car is the same aswell. No telemetry data or anything like that. This makes working towards a good car setup difficult.Dispite this, if you enjoyed 2016, you will like this one. With the new cars the cornering speeds have gone up alot. They look and sound much better and the AI seems to behave better aswell. I just hope that for next year the add a proper car setup system."

In a sport where split seconds make all the difference, I think codemasters has always understood the F1 series needs to be optimized enough to run smoothly on most rigs that meet the hardware requirements. That doesn't mean you can just max out all the settings and it's going to run as smoothly - not unless you have the hardware to support it - though on my GTX 1080, I've had no issues with frame dips - for me, it's been 60fps on every lapThe driving can feel as realistic as you want it to be. I have a wheel - and if you do too, then congratulations - this should be your benchmark to enjoy that wheel; that doesn't mean an Xbox controller would be a waste. F1 2017 has plenty of control schemes, individually saved, depending on what you want to use. A full set of assists and options for realism will help you find that sweet spot between difficulty and realism - so if you're a little intimidated by open wheel racing? Don't be. It's accessible to any gamer who's a fan of racing games.As for modes, a great amount of expansion has been added since 2016. Some of these modes are dual use - by both familiarilizing yourself with the track and each apex - to training you to apply it mechanically, such as coasting at the right moment to save fuel or learning how to ease up on your tyre wear. These are of course packaged as a sort of mini game within the race weekend - but they make practice sessions (an internal part of a typical formula 1 race weekend) something you WANT to attend.Along with these training challenges is the research and development options available to your F1 team of choice. Meeting those requirements during practice earns you points to spend on a rather extensive upgrade tree for your car and it's components - and like I said... I was surprised to see how many upgrade paths there actually are.The campaign mode is solid in its presentation. Starting as the second driver for your team of choice, you work through this R&D tree while also competing with a specific rival - cutscenes help frame the journey in between races, and they don't feel forced or campy.Sometimes you'll even be given ""invitational"" challenges, for example - cleanly overtaking as many slower cars as possible on a given track, while driving a classic F1 car like the 1996 Williams-Renault; which brings me to my next great addition. If you're familiar with the history of F1 to know these cars, then you probably already have picked this title up - but F1 2017 has included quite a few ""classic"" Formula 1 cars if the past. Each one of them sounding, looking and driving as they should - F1 history buffs would have a great time with this, but even a dumb yank like me appreciates the change of pace!Dynamic weather, night courses, push to talk voice control, mid session/race ""anytime"" saves  - theirs a lot here that's been added since F1 2011, and it's helped Immensely to fill out what was already an excellent racing series - and once it bites you? Once you start slinging yourself through corners and actually feeling the track (force feedback wheel owners rejoice) you might just end up driving that full 58 lap Grand Prix!In a nutshell, I don't have a lot of bad things to say about F1 2107. For a while, it feels like the F1 series was just a yearly paint job update for new teams and new drivers - and though not everything I've mentioned is groundbreaking? This is the first F1 I've owned that really felt truly well rounded. If you're looking for a white knuckle driving experience? Give it a spin.It's cliche to say it with annual or semi-annual sporting titles, but.... this this is definitely the best F-1 title released so far.Pros:- Expanded Career Mode with clever mechanics and invitationals- Excellent sound design- Some gewd gramphics- Adaptable and customizable driving to match your skill level (including flashbacks)- A better emphasis on race day strategy (customizable pit strategy, tyre and fuel saving techniques, etc)- Classic Cars!- Voice Communications actually tell me what I need to hear- Solid caution, pace car and penalty system (including pit lane speed limits!)Cons:- Apparent lack of SLI support (depending on what you have, you may not even need it)- Difficult to tell if the AI uses any other strategy besides ""as fast as its programmed to drive""- Damage physics are limited (your car won't sheer into 20 pieces - but you will loose a wheel/wing. But that's about it!)- Teammate seems to be just another driver on the track (which... they are... but i should be able to ask them to hold off the pack or let me by, beyond just another blue flag)"

When you throw more cars into the mix it turns to complete mush.It's really disapointing to see a game fail due to the AI alone, but in all honesty the rest of the game reals and looks really good, Force Feed Back support though not exceptional it is acceptable and control feels really responsible. The voice activated pit orders is surprisingly reliable and fun to use.But all in all the fact that the AI is total garbage and the fact that they will ruthlessly sideswipe you off the road with no penalty ruins this game for me, making it probabally my most disapointing purchase of 2017.

I feel accomplishment when I pass because the AI is more racey.Sure the quali is still calculated, but so what percentage based AI skill helps hone it into where it should be.  AI is MUCH better in race than past titles.  I've been ""dive bombed"" a few times by AI passing with DRS.  When I race in the Sauber, I can actually feel like I can't compete with mid/high teams unless I drive the lights out of a track (Or scale down the difficulty a few percentage points).Practice ""mini-games"" are much better, I can pass tire wear now on a game pad (It's hard to feather accel/brake on a pad).

The return of classic cars is fun and the new R&D system in the career mode is welcome as well. You really get a feel for what the car needs to be competitive. The engine wear is fairly bog though. The only way you won't take a penelty is if you purchase a fair few durablity upgrades. I just take the penaltys. The driver AI is improved, more racey and the lessened effect of the slipstream makes for some tight racing with the AI. The addition of the difficulty slider is also on point. When i started playing this game i was playing on 88. Having just increased it one point at a time when i felt it was too easy im now on difficulty 102 so really handy to be able to fine tune the challenge. Its still too easy to dive half the field into turn one tho. Things codies could imporove is more dialogue variety for commentators and engineer ( if you had 2016 you have heard it all before), more podium celebration animations, graphics aren't the best for a driving game, some sort of big celebration cutscene when you win the championship, maybe a mention of the fact that a driver is a defending champ for the next season by commentators. all the little things would go along way for immersion. An F3, and F2 series in the title would also be a cool thing to see on the cards at some point.Classic tracks would also be sickness esspecially as we lose malaysia next season. It would also be nice if the R&D helped equalise the cars at its end game.

The game does have flaws but the good most definitely makes up for the bad. I would suggest this game and here is why.Good:1: AI does not follow a strict path like they did in previous F1 games (By what I have heard)2: AI will fight for their position and will not just give it up, sometimes they will fight for it so much that they end up braking to late and running off the road.3: Graphics are great (Much better than 2016's version even though its 1 year difference)4: Lots of choices in F1 (Formula 1) cars from classic to modern.5: Good career that acts as if you are a real F1 driver and not just a randomly created storyline.6: Real F1 rules from Engine Swaping penalties as in if you got 4 engines you want to make those 4 last the whole season and same with gearbox.7: Realistic damage mechanics somethings and F1 2016 and before has never had.8: Engine damage.9: Gearbox Damage.10: AI difficulty adjustment from 0 Very Easy -> 110 Ultimate.11: Easy to learn.12: Each F1 team has different expectations as in if you pick Mercedes AMD you will be expected to do a lot and if you pick Mclaren or Sauber you are not expected much at all.13: Each F1 team has a different spec car Mercedes AMG being the best car out there and Mclaren and Sauber being tue worst.14: Can get contract terminated if you underperform.15: Start out as a second driver and can work your way up to primary driver.16: Can switch teams after each season.17: Need to do practices for points for the R&D Tree to upgrade your car.18: Has R&D Tree to upgrade your car.19: Have to qualify to figure out what spot on the grid you start out in (Grid being position at start of race).20: If you crash and your wheel comes off you will have to retire from session and you get auto placed to last or if you take out someone and he looses wheel first you will then be placed one spot or more above the person or persons you crashed.21: Has choice of 2 lap to 100 percent race (2 lap being 2 laps a race 100 percent being 60-90 laps a race and then there is a 25 percent which is like 10-12 and 50 percent which is like 19-30)22: Can turn off or on damage.23: Can turn assists on or off.24: Can turn racing line on or off (Race line being a line that turns red or green Red being Brake Green being Gas).25: Can save mid race and or simulate the race.Bads:1: AI can get to agressive and crash you into a wall.2: Need to learn how AI plays/how they fight for their spot.3: Best played with a race wheel but can be played with a game pad.4: Has bugs but is being worked on so thats a plus5: Online has major issues (But not really a online game anyway in my honest opinion)With that being said I do suggest the game and would say you should buy it and get anyone interested in the game or any racing sims to buy the game. The game like I said does have its flaws but the game for sure is better than it is bad.

Happy when program bugs was adressed and fixed, frustrated when not.I was directly addicted to 3D when I first tested it over 6 years ago. It is the Asus 120Hz 3D LCD. Of course, a few years later I also had to buy the VR HTC Vive. To me the VR HTC Vive was a big dissapointment compared to the Asus 120Hz 3D LCD system. Why? The VR HTC Vive dont support SLI + has very bad peripheral visual quality. The opposite is true for the Asus 120Hz 3D LCD system!The F1 2017 has become a very enjoyable simulator to drive. A good driving feeling in the car, AI-cars behave much more professional in F1 2017 + have the possibility adjusting AI-strength much better. IR-tracker support is finally reintroduced after having been dropped for a year in F1 2016.But all is still not fine with F1 2017. I am sure all is well in 2D, but in 3D a couple of visual issues still needs to be adressed.Like in F1 2016, the shadows, sprey behind cars and the clouds are still not in 3D. These small program-bugs makes an almost perfect 3D simulator worthless. This is not a new problem because in the earlier F1´s by Codemasters, the same visual flaws existed but their program-updates solved these issues.Are these problems SOLVED, I gladly recommend F1 2017.Until then, I have to chose from: iRacing, RaceRoomExperience,Asseto Corsa, wich all of them handle Asus 120Hz 3D LCD, WITH the shadows, spray and clouds, Perfectly simulated.One last comment. Since I have BOTH Asus 120Hz 3D and VR HTC Vive,  I want to express MY oppinion to anyone thinking on getting VR. Above I did not mentioned another serious drawback with VR googles. That is, after an hour or so one gets a pressing pain in the face because of the rubber bands that strip the googles to your face. One hour, then I at least have to stop using it.Want 3D? Dont think VR! Get Asus 120 3D LCD!! This have Exellent peripheral visual quality wich VR HTC Vive still lacks.  Asus 120 3D LCD have EXELLENT 3D. A 27 inch LCD screen to maybe HALF the  price you get a VR-system. (frankly, I dont understand why it is so unknown compared to VR. Also, it works with so many more games/simulators. As long as the program you want to run in 3D is mathematically correctly done and the most common graphic-engine is used by the program, it just WORKS!).You wont be dissapointed is my guess, rather quite the opposite!"

Of course non of us have driven an F1 car but if you follow F1 you will know about the torque of the current engine and how to have to be carefull with the throttle so you dont light up the rear tyres etc.The game looks great and I get a very good steady frame rate, but every two or 3 races i might get a slight frame drop which would be mildly annoying but usually doesnt affect my laptimes.The whole classic car thing isnt for me, it was fun the first couple of times but now it just feels like a chore so i just skip them, but you can definatly feel the difference in the amount of torque, grip and overall performace there is between cars from just a few years ago to the current generation.I play with a racing wheel which feels fantastic, i havent tryed playing with a controller but i dont think the experiance would be anywhere near as great, although its not a full sim racer and it is available on console so i would expect you can fiddle with the settings and it would be just fine with a controller.It is realistic in the sense than teams like McLaren are massively down on power so if you race for them expect to have a tough season to start with, but that is all part of the experience.If you are an F1 fan with a wheel i would say this is a smart purchase. If you are not and F1 fan then why are you reading this review? :D:D:D"
