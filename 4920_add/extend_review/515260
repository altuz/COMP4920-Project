,Recommended,515260,33283206,Posted: 5 July,all,Jiyorude,"Virtual Rides III is currently the best game out on the market within the funfair/carnival simulator genre. ZKW, the developer of the game, released an earlier game called Funfair Ride Simulator 3 which was first released on mobile devices, explaining the gameplay mechanics, dlc packs and graphics of that game. Virtual Rides III is their more in-depth and realistic take on the funfair genre.VR3 is the successor to VR2, which was released in 2014. Although fans had to wait a very long time for VR 2, it lacked a certain depth. You were given five rides to control with enhanced and updated graphics and that was all. I was personally very excited when VR3 was announced. Virtual Rides III lets you enjoy the game within two different perspectives just as the original games, but expanded into depth and gameplay possibilities. You can choose to wander around the fairground area and look at the crowd react to their surroundings. The crowd chooses which rides they want to enter, which foods they want to eat and they react to the style of control when it comes to your ride. You can be part of that, by also entering into the first person cam, which places you in the seat of the funfair ride while you control it yourself. On the other hand, you are a business man, a carnival ride owner. You can design your ride from the ground up, change the name of the ride, change the runnings lights, colors, jingles and use echo effects within your microphone, just as the real funfair rides do in northern Europe.The customization part of the game is great, and really never lets me quit playing this game. This depth is what the series really needed. I also enjoy the smiley currency within the game. If you give away a good show during your ride, you will gain more smiles from your customers. You can use these smiles to upgrade your ride with additional effects and parts. However, I wished that it would be expanded more in future updates, together with additional rides. Only seven running light sequences are fairly little, together with the available themes. It would be cool if you could import your own themes by adding a image import feature within the game, just as the user can insert their own jingles and music. The game is based on German fairgrounds, which depend on large rides to attract large crowds. I wish that you were able to control a larger variety of rides, such as kiddy rides (Carrousels, ufo jets, balloon rides), and some of the rides from FRS 3 and other amusement parks (Monster III, Huss magic, rock express, top spin).My final verdict is that this game resembles a realistic view on the fairground genre and lets you enjoy countless hours of good fun. Especially the customization is really additicing and enables you to really change the ride for the better towards your own liking. I am still looking forward to future updates and from this point of view on I believe the game can only become better in the future. Price is decent for what you get, if you manage to get it during a sale it is basically a steal."

The graphics are great and the possibility to add custom jingles and music makes the game more awesome!I hope for many more awesome rides and features in the future! I will keep playing the game for hours and hours, keep up the great work! :)"

It did take a lot of patience and trial and error with the graphics settings to get it to run smoothly, but I'm using an old 2013 MacBook. If you want excellent graphics, you should have a new, high spec machine. Remember that it is a simulator - not a game - so only get it if you want to operate rides."
76561198307733544,Recommended,515260,31484881,Posted: 1 May,all,ardkore1992,"More then a review but a history of my kirmes hobby and kirmes video games...Since my folks took me to Wildwood NJ at the age of 5, I've been a huge fan of portable amusement rides.  I remember being in my stroller and seeing the HUSS ""Pirate"" on Fun Pier for the first time and I was a-gasp at the vision of this thing.  I couldn't believe an industrial sized version of a kids boat toy could exist in real life.  Discovering other rides from a childs perspective was just as awe inspiring such as the next year I was in Wildwood I saw what looked like a gigantic carousel however this thing rose into the air and then started tilting around like it was going to fall over.  I couldn't believe this thing.  It turns out it was a swing ride, the Zierer Wellenflug / Wave Swinger.  Wildwood was also the first place I saw the Chance Zipper, another machine so weird, it's amazing that it exists at all.From that point on I became what the Germans call, a Kirmes Modellbauer (one who builds scale models of portable amusement rides).  First tinkertoys, then legos, then IHC models, and ultimatly Faller models.  I still enjoy this hobby today although finding hobby paint that doesn't suck has become an issue lately.There were never really any decent video games about this hobby.  When I had a DOS PC in 1991 there was a game Disney put out about roller coasters.  It was a sim where you could build roller coasters.  I never liked roller coasters so I built dark ride tracks with it and used my imagination.  Then with the playstation there was Themepark but I wasn't crazy about that game either, it was too cartoony.  I had another rollercoaster game on the Dreamcast but it was only about rollercoasters.  On the real Xbox 1 I had a themepark game that actually had a Wellenflug that was half decent but the game was really just about hiring help to clean up trash park visiters leave behind like on PS1 Themepark.  Since I was a fan of the actual rides I was no stranger to real ride catalogs and websites.  HUSS had interactive demo ""games"" of the Top Spin on their website for a few years in the early 2000s.  Later they included a CDRom in their catalogs after they became HUSS Park Attractions that had park models of the Frisbee, Topspin, and Jump interactive demo games.  Around that time someone on Ride-N-Rumors.de (maybe _this_ game publisher!) posted a tech demo of the Mondial Insider which gave me many hours of fun.Fast forward to now, I bought a modern gaming PC and I had heard about this game coming out.  VR2 and Funfair2 were out but I decided to wait for the new version.  I didn't even know this game was out yet till I was looking at my kirmes modellbau forums on facebook and I saw a link to this game.  Apparently it came out a month ago.  I bought it as soon as I saw it was out.I'm quite impressed with the game even if the only goal is to entertain yourself (there is not scoring unless you count the amount of visiters you ""amuse"").  The game is a sandbox where you can customize your rides (except for the sign font and color).  You make your own fun like ""how many times can I get the roll over to roll over"", and ""can I actually park the Evolution without hitting the cheat ""P"" park button?"".  It seems the rides are pretty authentic except for minor details that were altered intentionally.  I don't completely understand how altering fonts, decoration, and ride drive systems avoids copywrite infringment with the actual ride mfgs.  Maybe the law is different in Germany and you can just slightly alter small details on a ride and your in the clear.  I don't know.  If this game gets popular enough maybe you can get or renew sponsorship deals with HUSS, Mack, Chance, Mondial, etc.  This way the rides can look even more life like?Regardless, the game is very entertaining, the publishers are extremely good at patching glitches and adding new content for free.  I expect there will be pay DLC in the future and I will certainly be happy to buy them.  I really hope they build more classic rides from my childhood like the HUSS Condor, Mack Music Express, Petersburger Schlitzenfahrt, and my favorite ride type of all the Geisterbahn / Darkride / Ghost Train.  It would be great to build a Dante's Inferno or the Plushes Dinosaur Cavern.If your a hardcore fan of portable amusement rides / kirmes, you will love this game.  If your only casually into this, it's probably too geeky for you and you won't get nearly as much enjoyment out of it as I did.  This game was clearly built for the hobbiests and I really like that."

,Recommended,515260,30677172,Posted: 22 March,all,TonyTango,"If you enjoy playing other funfair simulators then this is definately for you :)Personally i have played a lot of funfair sims in the past and this has got to be up there with the best of them. The fact that the rides are pretty cool and well animated, textured and cool sounds too not too forget to mention the fact that people can ride all of the rides, also there are staff that help with the restraints which is pretty cool too.you can also customise every aspect of each of the rides with different lights, changing colour schemes , textures , also you can customise the special effects like fog machines and lasers etc.Note to developers: My pc is i5-2300 2.8 ghz and i can run this simulator very easily with no lag :)If you are really considering buying this simulator , then you seriously need to add it to your library :)also it would be good if you could add more rides either free or dlc's please :)"

,Recommended,515260,30593701,Posted: 18 March,all,KatyCatJulius,"if you think this is like rollercoaster tycoon or planet coaster then you are wrong, it is nothing like those games at all. in this game you can walk on a huge fairground (yes the fairground is actually huge!) where you will find 6 areas with 2 atractions/fairground rides each, you can completely controll all of those in total 12 rides and costumize every detail of them. while controlling the rides you earn smiles which you can use to unlock new costumization stuff, also you are able to control the lights, jingles and music there is also a microphone option. this is fun to do. performance is better now but needs more optimizations second the music, microphone and jingle system is better now but still needs work, you can't skip songs to the next song or skip them in seconds/minutes and there are keyboard shortcuts for microphone now and the music does fade down now which is both good!. and you have the jingle system, this jingle system is the worst i've seen! first if you have more than 12 jingles (which by default you have) then there is no keybinding for all of them, 3DMRS with their simulation called inversion got the perfect jingle system they give you 6 groups of jingles with 12 jingles each by doing this all of your jingles can be jused by a keybinding, just switch to the group the jingle you want to play is in, press the right keybinding and youre done. and secondly at a real fairground you hear the ride operators use jingles really fast for example they press a bottun for 1 jingle rapidly (you hear the jingle restart again and again and again) and then let the jingle play until it's done, in this game you cannot do that and that makes it not fun, in the inversion simulation of 3DMRS you can do that which is good. in the nd the game is now better than it was at launch but especially the jingle system needs work and it needs more optimizations as it is better but still not as good as it should be. for the fun of being able to controll a fairground ride i can recomment this game now so i will but don't expect that you can use jingles as good as they do at a real fairground and don't expect really good fps (i hope in a few months or so the fps will be a lot better, if you are lucky you will have good fps)when this game is actually better in some time in the near future i ofcourse will update my review :)the dev team said on facebook they want to create this game with us the players so since that is the case i want to ask everyone who has bought this game to report any bugs and feedback to the developer just like i do this way together we can make this game the best fairground simulation ever"

The environment is awesome and a lot more advanced compared to Virtual Rides 2.There are a couple of bugs still present in the game at this point but they are not that big of a deal and I'm sure the devs will take care of these within the next couple of weeks.I hope they will reintroduce some of VR2's features like the ipad control panel as well as a more logic keyboard control, this is at the moment very strange.It would also help if they would reposition some of the operators cameras.This game is great!"
