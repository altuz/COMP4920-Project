I think I finished it, I ran past the zombies in a forest section into a tunnel section of a road & then it put me back to the menu; I still had a key that I picked up which just says 'Key from Door' in my inventory, don't know where that was meant to go & I still had health so I don't think I died. The game doesn't have a story unless I was meant to pick up notes, so it is hard to tell if I was victorious in whatever this is about.I jumped past most of the zombie assets & ""finished it"" in 15 minutes.Basically, this is all the zombie models you've seen in Unity & that model from I think it is X-17 where the teeth are too big for the mouth (if you're a fan of stock Unity assets as I am, you know the one I mean).It wasn't glitchy  or buggy, the framerate was fine; it was just a very basic 'kill the zombies or don't' shooter that exists for seemingly no reason. It cost less than $1, so I find the overall quality & content less offensive than some of the other asset flips on Steam.I don't recommend it, but more for the reason that the lack of story means there doesn't feel like there is any reason to be there, doing these things, even for less than $1; but I've definitely spent a dollar on worse."

Very little effort here.It's the start of something nice but this IS the final product.I completed the ENTIRE game in 28 minutes. Not speed running and idling for a few minutes to go to the bathroom.It's cheap but still ain't worth the money.You need to eat every 3 minutes or you will die. Yes, that's correct. Three minutes.Sound and music is awful but I expected that.AI is straight idiotic but some models look nice.It's 2 gig for 30 minutes of unchallenging and uninspiring gameplay.Many bugs.Two of the maps are direct copies of maps from Left 4 Dead 1. Play the game for yourself and you'll know exactly what ones I mean.The dev seems to be obsessed with asian girls because there are tons of pictures of them and some are half nude. (they are covered but still) (this kind of thing turns me away from many video games)Animations are alright.Icons for in game equipment are alright.Graphics I didn't mind.6/10. Refunding. As a fellow indie dev who strives to make his games as good as possible, getting community involvement and eliminate all bugs and such, it really annoys me to see ""finished"" products like this. Even if for only a dollar. Crap is still crap.P.S. If you're just going to comment to start trouble, don't. I'm not going to be harassed by a bunch of fan boys for having an opinion of my own."

I tried giving it a chance, i know it is cheap and almost free.. but it should be free for something someone calls a game.Even for the low price I would not recommend this... It feels unfinished.. but it is not early alpha or anything? Feels like a free game you play on Facebook or something. I don't get the hunger part either.. I didn't eat anything and nothing happened? And you can jump, but can't jump on anything. You weapons can break? But the game is far to short for it to be any ""danger"" of that happening. This is lame. Needs much much much much work and more thought into it.. I like the ""RPG"" style with the inventory.. but it is far useless due to your armor never breaks, and you never need to use medpack or anything... Just a big NOPE so far.Oh and also to add! In the trailer they show you like 95 % of the whole game :) Enjoy."

There are an amazing amount of poor design decisions in this title:1.The melee weapons are FAR overpowered, you can beat the entire game with the knife.2. The weapons have a durability meter that is pointless, the game is too short; you'd never break a weapon even if you went out of your way to kill every enemy in the game with one.3. The game gives too much ammo and supplies, you never feel in danger of  running out; towards the end I startedhaving to unload the ak-47 into enemies just to save space for other types of ammo.4.Some of the weapon inventory icons do not represent the in-game items/weapons.5.Zombies are very slow so you can run through the entire level pacifist style if you wanted.6.The game just ends by kicking you to the title screen, At first I thought it was a bug or something so I reloaded and beat the game twice just to be sure.7. Some assets don't have a Physical forms in-game (you can walk through set-dressing objects like buses and cars)8. Some assents DO have physical forms that MAKE NO SENSE!! You can't shoot through bushes or glass...9. Enemies don't do enough damage.10. You can stun lock with your knife so the zombies don't stand a chance.11. Nonsensical invisible walls.12.Its mostly an asset flip. There is nothing wrong with buying assets tp import into your games; but the game isn't aesthetically pleasing when you notice the midevil underworld minon zombies stambering next to the office temp worker zombies.Do mind that this title ISN'T in early access; This is it. THATS ALL SHE WROTE! For $ 1.09 CAD I could have gotten a snickers bar... So the question is did I enjoy this game more then I would have say a crunchy chocolate waver bar~?No. I'm going to get a refund. -Which is unfortunate, but I insist the the developer of this game NEVER GIVE UP! You've gotten the base of creating a game; not pour your effort into your next project! Take what you've learned from making Inventiuon 2 and make sure that your next game is properly balanced and created."

,Not Recommended,515310,25679660,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,Monsieur-Owly,"To be honest, I have really mixed feelings about Invention 2. Sure, it's another typical indie FPS with zombies. No doubt about it. And it's really easy to see that it's made with Unity asset flips. Those who played The Slaughtering Grounds and other indie FPS might recognize the infamous saw-toothed zombie. Also, it will take no more than 30 minutes to beat the game and the ending just leaves much to be desired.On the positive side, unlike other indie FPS with zombies, Invention 2 features an inventory and scavenging system  (weapons, ammos, equipment, food) that show some effort although they are underexploited. At least, the gameplay involves a minimum level of surviving.Considering its price, Invention 2 is worth a buy and worth your time.Since the current Steam score does not represent the actual quality of the game, I'll have no choice but to display my review as a negative one.Rating (for a 1$ game):6.0 / 10Rating (according to my game preferences):3.0 / 10"

With the exception of Gasp, which if you don't know what it is, it is basically a walking simulator, this is the worst game I have ever played. On the cover it looks like a fun game, the video shows the player mowing down hordes of zombies. it only costs 99 cents, what could possibly be bad about this game? I'll tell you the problem. The hordes of zombies don't make any sense. neither does the map. I came out of the first area and saw three zombies in an alley way. I went and explored that whole alley, killing those zombies along the way. I came back out and sneaked into a weapons shop set myself up with a lit loadout, grabbed all the ammo and went outside feeling confident. maybe like three minutes i realized that the zombies weren't going to stop when a horde of like 15 zombies came out of the alley i had cleared. another problem, you use to mucb ammo for the amount of zombies there are. The weapons will sometimes not hit their target. I'll have a clear shot to the chest against a zombie and it'll just decide not to hit it. It's unacceptable. Your stamina is useless, since you friking run out of it after less than a second, and doesn't regenerate immediately. I can honestly say that, without a doubt, this is the worst game i have ever played, in my entire life. I'm gonna go play some watchdogs now. Anything is better than this trash."

It does have trading cards and it's very cheap, which is nice, but on the other hand, it has very many problems.- The graphics are mot very good- There are too many supplies- There are many invisible walls- Zombies walking through wallsThat is only a couple of the problems. I could keep going for a while. But to be honest I have had more fun playing this game than many of the games I have in my library. If you collect games or trading card this is the game for you. But if you are looking for great gameplay and a good story you should keep away. If you are looking for something to entertain you for 45 minutes, and then refund it after, then this is the perfect game for you."

The ambience and atmospehere is perfect for the survival horror genre. You wander out on to an open street and see a ton of zombies just standing there, as you spot the open building you hope they don't see you as you make a dash for it. Unfortunately you are not lucky enough and have to hold them off along the way! The sounds and model designs are great, along with a UI that is simple yet functional. There is no stutter, no missing textures or areas that feel empty. I agree it is a little too short and we do get left with items/keys and there is no end scene. I have to add, this as a series has a lot of potential if the time and effort can go in circumstances allowing. As stated in the description though, this is an episode and I hope there will be more to follow on!

Whilst the game does not really do anything wrong, it does not really do anything right either.The game is short, you can easily finish it in less than 20 minutes. Very ugly graphics and with plenty of assets you have seen elswhere. The biggest problem is the complete lack of danger, in fact the arbitary (and utterly pointless) hunger meter is more dangerous than the zombies! You could easily complete the game just using your melee weapons.So its a cheap, linnear and mostly competent zombie shooter that lacks any pacing, danger or excitement. On the upside the controls are smooth and the performance and stability are good. Worth the 80 pence if you just want to mindlessly hack down braindead zombies, but don't have L4D2."

My original opinion of the game still holds as far as Im concerned.  Its a very basic, mindless zombie shooter that tries very hard to model itself after L4D.  Even most of the few ""levels"" resemble L4D levels in layout and scenery-well, they would if L4D had far more primative graphics that is lol!  Anyway, you get what you pay for here.  If you expect a 99 cent game to be a 99 cent game then you'll be fine with what you get in this game.  If you try to compare this game to games that cost far more than 99 cents then you are being rediculously unrealistic and are probably that way concerning all things in your life so you cant be happy with anything anyway.  Either way, I dont care lol!  Im just telling you my thoughts on the game.  Good luck and have fun ;)This game is pretty basic.  You WILL get bored of it quickly.  This game WILL NOT challenge you.  Its like Left4Dead without the story, without the graphics, without the variety of maps and without...well, without a lot of things lol!  BUT it costs only $0.85 cents right now.  And for that tiny sum of 85 cents, you get a simple and mindless little zombie shooter that can resolve a few minutes of your boredom once and awhile.   So, as far as cost verses content value, I think that the current sale price is about right for what you get in this game(which isnt a whole lot).  Since I believe that the game is worth the eighty something cents being asked for it right now then I must give it a thumbs up.  Sure, buy it.  Why not?  Just dont buy it expecting a game that would be worth more than eighty something cents."

The campaign was absolutely amazing, I was baffled that it wasn't given the sandbox tag given how many different approaches you can take to the game's mechanics and story progression...oh wait"

,Not Recommended,515310,34697176,Posted: 2 September,all,Queenie,"This game sucks all of the ♥♥♥♥♥...No, really, it sucks all of the ♥♥♥♥♥!It's somehow even worse than the first one! Few things have been added or changed, the character models and assets are the same from their previous asset flip and there's actually, somhow, less content in this game than the first one.Invention 1 had around 3 of the big monster zombies.Invention 2 has 1 of them and you can walk right past it, without it attacking you.The wide open spaces of this game don't do it any favours, zombies don't notice you unless you shoot them or get too close as they have no spacial awareness, whatsoever and there aren't any new assets added to this game at all. The level design is significantly worse than the last one as the corridor shooter design of the last one didn't show off how awful its long distance backgrounds were and how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the AI is.I will say though that the worst thing, the thing that pisses me off the most? Is the ending...The first game at least attempts to trick you into thinking that there is an ending but it's broken but this game is a little more up front about it's not caring by simply dumping you back to the main menu, once you reach a certain point in the game.Just... ♥♥♥♥ this game!Don't make an invention 3! Fix 1 and 2! Or just ♥♥♥♥ off all together, either would make me perfectly happy."
