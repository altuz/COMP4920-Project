We can say it's only about focus.But songs... Really made for only this game? Couldn't find them somewhere else. It's the best Jingle Bells i've ever heard. Also other songs are good too. You should get the game with %90 coupon and play to listen, listen to play."

Soundtrack (Christmas?)Cons:- Makes you sick- Not enjoyable- Easy but Grindy AchievementsTip:Turn down the sensitivity, it makes it easier.ReviewHyper color ball was a game that I got just for the achievements. When I first started to play, it made me so sick, the starting sensitivity is way too high and the color combination is awful. After I turned down the sensitvity the game was very easy for me. The achievements are a little grindy like die 100 times which is pretty easy but still takes some time. As a game itself it is very boring and is not very fun to play. The music was okay; nothing amazing but okay to listen to. If you are looking for an easy perfect game this is for you when it's on sale. I would not recommend this to anyone else besides achievement hunters.This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curationOnce we have a 100 followers on our group there will be a game giveaway, but only the followers have a chance to win.If you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.

There is little to no touch on the keyboard controls, and that makes it very difficult to negotiate the obstacles. If you thrive in a state of frustration, this game is for you."

The game also seems to punish me if my score goes above 100, as the ball implodes and I get game over, no matter how much health I had remaining. Refund requested."
,Not Recommended,515470,26106200,"Posted: 18 October, 2016",all,Real,"Sorry but this game is not a good one despites the 'positive' users reviews right now. It's not a rythm game because of the controls of the ball which revolves around the tube continously which make the controls to be totally unrelated with the tempo. There's no online scores, no achievment, no level, no challenge, UI is clumsy and ingame soundtracks are unpleasant. If you like these kind of games, try Dub Dash or Riff Racer instead, but avoid this one. I got it at 10cts, but hopefully I will have the possibility to sell the cards to get my refund."
,Recommended,515470,29655401,Posted: 2 February,all,crippler,"Okay - very simple game, you can't play through. It's just a little survival mode steering your ball not into obstacles.  Slowly it gets faster + faster, but it's still very, very easy cause the obstacles are the same after 5 minutes and don't vary.One of the ""hardest"" achievement is to survive 180 seconds, but this is not a big deal! I personally suck in those games and could make it to ~ 440 points/seconds easily!Bad are 2 achievements - catching the rare Virus 25 times is taking some time - even more to die 100 times...thats just annoying..Only 3/10, but still recommend cause cheap, easy to complete achievements + cards!"

You just have to dodge some obstacles and can collect only 2 different kinds of powerups - health or slow virus. The controls are bad. Because of A D left right and W for jump. If you choose for left or right the ball keeps on spinning into this direction around the middle pole. It's quite nervy and cause the most crashes. Also achievements only popup after leaving or reentering he game. Stil not fixed. To protect you from epileptic reaction I recomment to choose some non flashy wall/surfaces on your sphere and the pole."

There is no essence of difficulty when playing and it gets incredibly repetitive after a while. I tried to be good, I gave it a stab to see if it got any better, but really I'm only playing it to finish the achievements and then I'm done.As for the music... It would actually drive you insane, but then I thought that I could use the 'feature' where you can place your own .wav files in and listen to your own music instead. No. It did not work (why am I not surprised), the in-game christmas music clearly overpowers it and the files for the music aren't in the music folder so you can't change them.If the creators were to spend more time on the game and fix a few things then maybe I'll come back to it."

A++++++++++ Game!Why I ChangedThey change the game to much what used to be a fast paced hair raiseing challege has been turned into a clunky mess your ball used to glide now it feels sticky and slow, all to make some babies who dont like a challege happy. I would play this on my hour lunch breaks i havent touched it in month since they change the fluidity of the balls movements. THANKS KIDS Finally had a challege then you had to cry about it being to HARD! Also the christmass music from last year in 2016 has not been changed."

I'm finding it hard to see what is coming up next and mostly it's a bit of guess work especially when you're upside down.Meh, cost me £0.47 on sale, it's scratching that kind of itch that Super Hexagon does if you fancy a simple game whilst you're just chilling. Music is really nice, I'll give it that."

Tried loading my own music, a track I converted to ogg didn't show up in the game, having a track list would be helpful, as well as supporting more common file types. I ended up muting the game sound and playing music externally, the color syncronization didn't seem to do much for me."
