They areveryindie, and have a lot of character.2. They are quite simple games; definately a one-trick-pony as far as mechanics go. No RPG elements or anything like that. The first minute of playtime will be exactly the same as the 30th hour of playtime, except you may be better at it.3. IMO there should only be one game, and not three, but hey they are cheap.4. Your only goal is score-chasing.Yeah, the series is overly simple, but they are fun to play in short bursts and definately have great indie feel."

The target is much more stable now. This is Ubermosh series on nitric acid, super fun to beat and the music simply didn't worn off yet. Not for me.Thoughts: Walter... you're on longe term trouble man. Your commitments literally have created a vicious circle to everlast impendin addiction.What??The more you keep doing games like this, the more I want it - hence my previous censored comparisons, like dope. Where the hell will this lead us to? To unstoppable brainclap rage, unfair swarm, loose gunner paradise? God help us. Nah, forget him. I'll just find a Big Fuccing Gun. Faster the better."

Black added a system called brainclap, where after a certain amount of KO's, you kill a lot of stuff with an attack. and vol 3 added an endless arena, which would be nicer if it had stuff in it, it also added swarming enemies and other things that i've probably forgotten about.and finally, graphics, audio and all that stuffits standard 8-bit (but not actually 8-bit, its like 16 or 32 bit but it has the pixelly feel) graphics which work really well with the scenary, the soundtrack is AMAZING, so i bought it (its a weird kind of heavy metal electric music that works), and it runs perfectly whether your computer cost $7000 and runs better than an olympic athlete, or a 12 year old laptop run on lemons."

,Recommended,515570,24976341,"Posted: 17 August, 2016",all,[ Maxie ],"I've been a follower of the UBERMOSH series for a while and when I heard that Vol.3 was out, I immediately had to get it.And it's still just as intense as ever, but now it's moved to the open world, meaning that you're no longer confined to a small area. There isn't any cover so you do have to play this one different tactically. And I like that.The brainclap introduced in UBERMOSH:BLACK makes a comeback along with several more achievements (I like the addition of the survivor-like achievements as well as the score addition), and the game is still as fast-paced and frantic as ever. And still good fun.A couple of criticisms though. As much as I absolutely love the soundtrack and how fitting it is, I would love some new tracks so there's more cyberpunk moshing to be had. There is some slowdown when there's a lot going on but neither of these detract from the fun this is.Yes, some might argue it's more of the same but the open-world arena and the extra challenge presented by a new enemy (they remind me a little of the swarm in SWARMRIDERS in their movements) definitely set it apart from the other entries in the series.I'm sure there's more to be added to the game but as for some suggestions: perhaps an infinite respawn mode, still within 90 seconds, where you try and gun down as many enemies as possible but perahps there's deductions for using respawns? And maybe some new guns or even more blade moves.All in all, a highly recommended experience and good for short bursts of fast-paced action. This isn't a game to be played for hours on end but it's good for quick bursts of gameplay."
76561198095119607,Recommended,515570,26380395,"Posted: 2 November, 2016",all,DarkSyndrome,So I happen to get this game by being bored and decided I would browse steam during the holloween sale for some cheap games. Saw this in the list and for some reason the Name of the game interested me. Got al three games and the OST for only $2.39. GREAT DEAL! Right away when I started playing it it was just amazing. You are like some punk samurai chick(that can also use gun) who must slay aliens and other things and you can also cut/block bullets.It never really gets boring either. You just always want to try and get a better score than you previously did :D. I would definitely recommend this game if you love like 8bit 3rd person shootem up games.

,Recommended,515570,27233353,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,Cream-of-Plenty,"(A lot of this review will be identical to the original UBERMOSH because the two games are VERY similar).Just like the original UBERMOSH, Vol.3 is comparable to a top-down Devil Daggers:  You appear in an arena and are tasked with surviving 90 seconds of relentless onslaught. 90 seconds isn't much, right? And all of the enemies die in a single hit--how hard could this possibly be?As it turns out, hard as ♥♥♥♥ing nails. Set to a thrumming metal and techno soundtrack (which is still easily one of the best things about the UBERMOSH series), you will die again and again and again. Fortunately the game subscribes to Edmund McMillen's ""Super Meat Boy"" model, wherein dying happens quickly and restarts are virtually instantaneous. This game doesn't want to waste your time--it just wants 90 seconds.Depending on your class*, you may begin with a sword; use it to relieve an opponent of one of a handful of different firearms. Some of these weapons are great. Some aren't so great. Fortunately (as I previously mentioned) enemies die as quickly as you. Therefore the best weapons are those that allow you to spread death around fastest. Within 30 seconds of a single game, you'll have access to every available weapon--pick the one that works best for you.*There are several unlockable classes that are fundamentally different takes on the same thing: One can only use a sword, one starts with the best weapon, etc. And each has a different number of allotted respawns. They impact the game, but not in a radical way.This time around, there is also a ""Brainclap"" mechanic to compensate for a complete lack of cover.  The way it works, each character class automatically produces a ""Brainclap"" (an explosive attack that can clear most enemies from the screen) after a certain number of kills; some of the weaker classes have lower thresholds for triggering one of these explosions, making them more common.  In general, it helps provide a risk-reward mechanic for some of the weaker classes since the Brainclaps are most common (and effective) in large groups of opponents.The game is stripped of all but the barest essentials--there's nary a plot, an economy, or an exposition.  Like UBERMOSH, Vol.3 doesn't have time for those sorts of formalities. And because of that, the game's a great shot of adrenaline whenever you've got more than a couple of minutes to stop and play it.Who might like this game? Anybody who wants a no-frills top-down shooter that's hard as hell. People who love a soundtrack that makes you want to kill, crush, and destroy. For those who played Devil Daggers and thought, ""You know, I wish this game was remade as a twin-stick shooter."" For $1.99 this game is a solid deal; for $0.99--the price of a candy bar--you'd still be a fool to skip out on this game.PROS+ Great Soundtrack+ Super accessible drop-in/drop-out model+ Very challenging+ Additional ""Brainclap"" mechanic is a solid additionNEUTRAL~ EXTREMELY similar to UBERMOSH--to the point that you could almost argue Vol.3 should have been a game mode in a previous game.  Still, you can get both games for a combined $1.49 on sale, so it's not a big deal in this case.CONS- No Steam Cards (even the previous Ubermosh had them)- Weapons and enemies could still use a little more variety"

The game is extremely fun for a short amount of time, and the game is very cheap, but on the other hand I have seen games that have had way more effort put into them and are also very fun, but still free.This game has a few classes that barely differ:-Some start with a sword, some start with a gun, some have more lives than others, some have the special move start earlier.Also there are only a few enemy types, meh soundtrack, a few gun types and a completely flat map with no walls or anything.I have also noticed is that this game seems like to basically reuse what the first one Ubermosh game had, barely changing anything and still asking for money....I just don't see that much effort put into it.
