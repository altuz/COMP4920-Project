Will write a more detailed one later on.This game is great if you like roguelites. I bought it because I loved the art but it's also very fun. I'm pretty sure whoever made this game was high on several different drugs but it just adds to the charm. It's pretty basic in some senses, 90% of rooms are just enter and kill everything, but the combat is fun so that's ok. The items have been pretty damn varied so far. Unlocked a couple characters and they all have their own distinct playstyle. Definitely worth the price if you like roguelites and great pixel art!"
,Recommended,515650,32057161,Posted: 29 May,all,Dennis,"Simple, challenging, tight and really, really weird, Straimium Immortaly is like a lost 90s PC gaming gem but without most of the problems that plagued those. Even with the intentionally gross art style, the graphics and sound design work together to create a very charming, lo-fi game.Gameplay-wise, it's a mix between a ""roguelite"", a metroidvania and a shmup. There is a pool of pre-built rooms put together randomly to form an open, fully explorable square map divided into 5 increasingly difficult areas, with many different types of rooms (puzzles, challenges, shops, etc). In each of the 4 first areas there's a boss that, when killed, drops a key. With four keys in hand, you open the final boss in area 5. Your character can fly and dash in any direction and your guns can only fire forward, turning every battle into an exercise in pattern reading and quick dodging. It's challenging without being unfair or trapping you in nigh-unwinnable scenarios.Overall, it's a nice little hidden gem with a low price tag and lots of personality. A few technical problems and awkward decisions here and there, sure, but it's an enjoyable trip into the strange, strange world of Straimium.(PS.: The weird English everything is written on can be off-putting for some, but it's far from indecipherable.)"
,Recommended,515650,26114252,"Posted: 19 October, 2016",all,Misery,"So today, I'll be reviewing a game called ""Stramium Immortaly"".  The funky name is just the tip of the mountain of weird that can be found here.This game, at heart, is something of an Isaac-ish roguelike.  You've got a big dungeon to explore, special rooms to find, items and powerups to grab, and you'll create a unique build over the course of the game as you power-up your character.However, this isnt played from the top-down view that Isaac uses.  This plays more like a 2D side-scrolling shmup, but without the side-scrolling.   Your character can move in any direction, but you can only fire left and right.  This may sound restrictive, but the whole game is designed with this in mind; you're not really going to encounter anything that's made stupidly hard simply because you cant aim upwards or something.   You also have a special power you can activate, which is on a cooldown, and a secondary attack that uses mana (and you can find new weapons, powers, and secondary attacks, too). And you have something like a dodge move.   Sounds pretty simple so far?   From here though, is where it starts to differ a bit.Firstly, unlike other games in this genre, you're not going through the normal level/floor based setup that you usually do.  An entire run is combined into ONE inter-connected dungeon maze... think Rogue Legacy's castle.  Like in the game, there are different sections divided by difficulty level (and marked in different colors on the map), and you can go to any of them at any time... it's just usually not a good idea to go to the hard ones too early.  But you have that option.  The map gets interesting fast... not only do you have a huge and complex as hell maze of rooms to navigate, but the game is STUFFED with things to do.  So... many.... special rooms.   SO MANY.   I think I counted somewhere around 50 of the things?  And the full number of rooms that make up a full run is 121.   So... that's a TON of special rooms.  Which to me is part of the appeal of the game... you're not going to spend really long stretches of time JUST fighting stuff.  You're frequently going to be running across all sorts of special, interesting, and useful things.  Some of these things are simple to use... a shop for instance, or gates that lead you to alternate off-the-map rooms where you can find boss keys and power items.   Other things are alot more complicated, such as the room with the huge monument in the background... have fun figuring THAT out.  Other rooms are just bloody strange.  Like the one where you face off against what I swear must be Cthulhu's long lost brother in a game of rock-paper-scissors, and if you win too much he beheads himself to attack you, because of course that makes perfect sense.   Or there's what I call the ""Mario Block"" rooms... you'll know them when you see them.    The sheer amount of weird rooms and interesting things in the game really speak for the game's amazing level of creativity, as this is a game that never really starts to feel stale, and it never really feels like a carbon copy of anything else.And all of that creativity is backed up by fun, interesting game mechanics, great controls, interesting enemies/bosses, and unlockables.  And weirdness.  It's also got weirdness.Enemies and bosses are worth mentioning here... being that this game kinda controls like a shmup, enemies will thusly tend to attack mostly by flinging bullets at you, often in coordination with wonky movements.    Sometimes you get a ton of bullets on the screen, and not every bullet is made equal, some of them get funky in how they behave.  Learning enemy patterns is very important here.   Interestingly, unlike most games of this type, you dont HAVE to clear every single room of enemies in order to progress.  Most rooms, in fact, do not require this.... only occaisionally do you find an ""ambush"" room where the doors actually lock.   However, clearing out all the enemies in a room will open the treasure box in the back of most of them, dropping all sorts of possible pickups and items and whatnot, and it also ""goldifies"" the room on the map (counts towards run completion percentage, as does fully and properly using all special rooms).  This means that you can progress in the game in the way that you want to, and the game even has a speedrun timer function that you can turn on, if you like that sort of thing.As for bosses, well... these guys play into the goal of the game, which is to unlock the giant door at the center of the dungeon, which leads to the ""Queenie"", your final target.  Doing this requires that you defeat the boss of each of the four major areas; these bosses are big complex fights, however they never change from one run to the next... so they can get a little stale, which is kinda unfortunate.   But they still work out well and provide a fun challenge.  Once you've clobbered them and gotten all of the keys, you can go do the final fight.   A full run through of the game, a successful one, will take you a bit over an hour, including a bit of backtracking.   That, to me, is right about the proper amount of time that a run in this genre should take, particularly since as far as I know, this game lacks any save & exit feature.Also:  Items.  There are tons of them.  Powerups, consumables, weapons, sub-weapons, goofy things.... and they all have just about the strangest freaking descriptions you'll ever see.  This is pretty funny to be honest, as is all of the dialogue in the game, but it can make it a little confusing to deduce the exact effects of some items.  That aspect is a little annoying.   But there's alot of interesting and fun items to use, many of which get quite powerful.Not that you NEED crazy power here... while this game is challenging, it's not hugely difficult.  After just about 4 hours, I've beaten it for the first time, without all that much trouble.  However, with unlockable mutators (including ""Asian Mode"", which speeds up bullets and such... yes that's what it's actually called) and characters and things (and hats), there's alot of things that can change up the game and potentially increase the challenge for you.  You even have the option of doing ""small cube"" runs, where the dungeon is much smaller, making for quite short runs.  How hard the game is though of course is subjective... I realize I'm not the best one to judge difficulty here, as I'm used to games of extreme difficulty like bullet-hell shmups.  So you may find the game pretty hard, or maybe you wont.  You will probably be confused every now and then by some things though, I can promise you that.Regardless though... the game is just outright FUN.  So many interesting things to do, so much to see, lots of creative... everything... and such a unique and trippy style overall (did I mention the game is a bit strange?  Because it's definitely a bit strange) and fantastic gameplay really make this into a very unique title that has very few things that I personally consider to be flaws.  Honestly, I really cant think of much to complain about here.  I like basically everything about this.  Which is pretty freaking rare for me.If you like games of this genre whatsoever...  have a look at this one.  It's one of the strangest and most unique that you could possibly find, with tons going for it.  Highly recommended."

So, if you don't enjoy those kind of things, I cannot recommend this to you. Otherwise, so far, it's pretty great. Varied items, not too rediculous enemies, and... interesting design choices. Rather trippy, and the characters all speak like an odd combination of deviant-art sex-rp and drunk kindergarteners.Pros --Fun, like pretty addicting and whatnot as well.-Well balanced. You will die, but it is not impossible. You will improve.-A lot of things. Every playthrough so far has had something new.-Good music.-Interesting design...-Variety of characters, items, and power-ups.-No bugs so far.Cons --Very odd dialogue. Not really a con actually, but not a pro either.-Hard learning curve. You will need patience.-Hard to focus occasionally. There is a lot going on at times, and it is all very eye-catching.So far though, it's a good game."

76561198162701540,Recommended,515650,29750828,Posted: 6 February,all,Froderick,"STRAIMIUM IMMORTALY is one of the finest procedural 2D action games I know of, and I do play a lot of them. I would put it up there (with Downwell and Teleglitch) among my favorite indie discoveries, and another example of truly great game design executed by an individual developer.STYLE:The first thing you might notice about this game (perhaps the reason it piqued your interest in the first place) is that it is absolutely dripping with psychedelia. There is a breathing, flowing quality about the visual elements in this game that is both pleasing to the eye and subtly overwhelming. The psychedelic feel is authentic, and the pixel art is sublime. That being said, it would be a mistake to judge this game solely on its hallucinatory visuals - this is not just an empty gimmick like the presentation layer of so many otherwise lackluster 2D indie titles. Behind all of the style and comically deranged language is a finely-tuned action game with brilliant balance, tight controls, and great replay value. There is art here but there is science as well, demonstrating both inspiration and keen intelligence on the part of the developer.CONTENT & SUPPORT:Not only is the game design strong, but the ongoing support is absolutely heroic. (Recently, for example, the developer fixed a bug that I found, within hours of me posting it, and had a new update ready to go by the time I finished eating my lunch!)In the time since I bought this game, the content updates have been coming faster than I can absorb the new additions.GAMEPLAY:STRAIMIUM IMMORTALY looks like a platformer at first, but you have unlimited flight, so your character’s legs are essentially cosmetic. Therefore, as the description indicates, it is more like a shmup with (light) bullet hell elements, crossed with a roguelite Metroidvania platformer. [That was an odd sentence].If you look at the core mechanics of this game, you control a little guy that can move XY in 2D space and shoot left and right. He can also dodge a short distance and has a secondary fire mode and a special attack. That’s it. But from simple mechanics, great gaming experiences can emerge.Like Downwell, it seems like a lot of thought and care went into making the perfect control scheme. The act of moving about and shooting is fun all by itself. This is, IMO, very important with 2D action games. The player should feel empowered, not restricted. This game does that well. STRAIMIUM IMMORTALY makes dashing/dodging a core mechanic and thereby makes you feel nimble, like a space ninja should.PROS:+ Solid gameplay with tight controls (works great with Xbox One controller)+ Crazy bosses with unpronounceable names+ Punishing (but not artificial or unfair) difficulty level that challenges the player to hone skills. Learning curve is rewarding.+ Option to generate dungeon from seed or at random (using a seed allows you to strategize a bit more, based on previous runs)+ Wide variety of weapons, powerups, game mutators, secrets, etc. keep things fresh. It feels like there is always more to discover (and new content is frequently added).+ Trippy visual style with lots of thought-provoking details (i.e. abundant non-hostile 'lifeforms' and intriguing background elements)+ Inventive, stylized language is both comical and surrealCONS:- No multiplayer (does this matter to you?)- Could use greater musical variety (The music that is included is perfect, I just want more)- Some bugs may exist at any given time (which is really because the game is updated so frequently that it's always changing. Bugs tend to be fixed just as fast as they are introduced).I can't recommend this game highly enough to anyone who likes 2D action, procedural generation, rogue-lites, crazy powerups, or game design as an artform. Frankly, I think STRAIMIUM IMMORTALY doesn't get nearly the level of acclaim that it deserves."

I'm not sure why I never heard of this game up until now, but I am very glad I did as this is an amazing game. Game pretty much throws you inside and lets you explore where you want without any limitations besides the countless deaths you will encounter within a short period of time. Bosses were very quirky and different while also challenging at the same time. There are quite a few items in the game for you to collect along with some customization of which you also find by literally throwing your soul into a tv screen, kind of like how you are right now reading this review. For speed runners there is also a pre-installed mechanic to track your time which is nice. (Good luck speed running this as your slower than your mother buying ""one thing"" from your local grocery store.) Soundtrack was pretty decent as well which added to the overall game. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a decent challenge or something of the unusual sort."

I'm not sure how much lasting appeal it will have, despite the random layouts and abundance of items I feel it will eventually get a little samey. But for the time I've spent in it so far I've definitely had my money's worth of entertainment. And I love the whole aesthetic of it, the mixture of old-school charm and alien mystery, wrapped in quirky dialogue and LSD colour scheme.It is fairly tough to start with, and any new players I would recommend choosing large maps as they will give you more stuff. Things i would have liked in this game: some kind of local mini map so you don't have to keep pausing, and a bit more powering up of the main weapon (just for funsies, you get plenty beefy enough to deal with everything as it is).Anyway, nice game."

It would be great if there was an option to stop and save a playthrough to resume later (for the sake of those times when you need to walk away and don't want to have to replay the whole level/seed to get back to where you were), but if you like a good challenging shooter, it's worth every cent.

The sound style is totally my thing too.If you are looking for a hardcore roguelike, maybe give this one a pass.

Quite a bit has been added and changed, and as suits a roguelike, it's harder and more varied now.First of all, the addition of hazards is welcome.  Each section of the game includes several elements placed throughout that can hurt you, especially if you lack dodge.Further, there are more rooms with multiple enemy types, and an unlocky for even more of such rooms.Then there are alt bosses, which are each a bit harder, and add much much needed variety.And of course, more items, more little hidden things to do, and then mini-quests that unlock the other characters.

Everything from the items and weapons to the way players can explore / progress through the dungeon and unlock characters adds something new and interesting to the game. Items / upgrades are all interesting and provide just enough of a power bump to let players feel more powerful without being overpowered. Weapons are very diverse with interesting pros / cons and overall just are really fun to use.While the game can feel a bit chaotic and players can feel a bit pressured and nervous about continuing to explore the dungeon at first, there are just enough ways for them to step back and take a breather and relax. The difficulty of the game is right at the sweet spot of being challenging enough to not get bored but not so hard that it is frustrating to play. Dying doesn't feel like a waste of time thanks to all the things players can unlock and accomplish, nor does it feel unfair. Every death I've had has been because I took on too much, and never did I feel like I lost a round because of terrible RNG (which often times is the most infuriating thing about games like this).The only complaint I have about this game is that the art style is a bit hard to read at times and can cause problems seeing what is actually happening on the screen. The colors are all pretty saturated and muddled, which can make the game a bit hard to look at. That being said, it's not bad enough to make me not want to play it or recommend it any less. Also, the music is pretty awesome, so I'm willing to overlook such a small flaw. If you're reading this and looking at this game and somehow still on the fence, you'd be doing yourself a disservice to pass it up."

,Not Recommended,515650,33942148,Posted: 31 July,all,Cat ✅,"Just briefly playing the game, one major flaw I've noticed is the inability to shoot vertically. This means if any enemies are above or below, you can't hurt them and instead have to weave your way around to be exactly horizontal. This breaks the game for me, as the enemies don't have to follow suite and instead can kill you from any direction."

,Recommended,515650,28302892,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,Pretentieux,This game is like Straimium Immortaly but it is exactly like it and the developer did a great job rendering it in it's own engine exactly like he did that time that he did it.  I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a game to be recommended to them that is fun & unique & an obvious labor of love.

There's lots to learn and many unlocks/achievements. It obviously doesn't have the content of games like Enter the Gungeon, but it is less than half the price. I say it's well worth it if you can snag it on sale."
