76561197991023581,Not Recommended,515980,29810884,Posted: 9 February,all,i kill people,"As someone who has an Iron Warriors army dedicated to the Tallarn war, this was basically an instant-buy for me.Gameplay wise, it's okay.I highly suggest going for the How to Play the moment before you begin, so you know the basics of how the game plays. But, if you played 40k, most of the tank combat carries over. Firing at your targets from the side or rear has a higher chance at dealing damage, so positioning and movement are perhaps even more important than shooting. (Except for Contemptor Dreads, who basically one-shot everything with their power fists). The AI is competent, and will give you a run for your money especially on hard.My major complaints are the sound, music and sprite department, which really could use some work. It sounds like it's a PC game from the early 90s, and that's when there's music that plays. Most of the time, it's just silence during gameplay. The poor sound, mediocre sprites and effects doesn't really help the cheap iOS feel that the game has from time to time.As an app, I wouldn't be as critical. But on PC, I'm expecting a few upgrades at the very least. Especially at the asking price.Finally, I wish there were some ease-of-life fixes. For example, make it easier to rotate your tank. Fix the rotation button instead of making figure out which pixel is okay to click on. As well, even with a tutorial telling me how to navigate the clunkiness of the game, it's far too easy to make mistakes with the current interface. It's easy to make mistakes when figuring out which weapon you're going to fire. It's easy to mess up your movement and shooting because a friendly unit got in the way of your firing arc. It's easy to underestimate how long it takes to climb a hill, messing up your unit's movement.And it's this clunkiness that makes it hard for me to recommend thus far. As it stands, it's hard for me to recommend it. I like it, and I want to like it more. I love the setting, I love the factions in play, and I love the 40k universe, and I'm going trudge through another few hours, and hope things turn out for the better."
,Recommended,515980,29921276,Posted: 14 February,all,bad_rain,"Battle of Tallarn is a decent hex-based tactics game. Very minimalistic in design and visuals, obviously low-budget. Also, it's an iOS port, so if you're alergic to such things, stay away.This game has a lot of problems, beginning with serious balance issues, clunky UI and somewhat ""cheap"" feeling. Some of those issues were patched, other are promised to be improved, but you can't change the overall mediocrity.For what it's worth, it's a 10$ game and if you need your Wh40k fix, you'll get some enjoyment out of this. Don't expect it to be very tactical - most scenarios rely on you knowing what to do from the start. So, on later levels you're pretty much destined to lose the first attempt. And yes, forget about playing the traitor side - their campaign is horribly unbalanced at the moment. To the devs credit, some balance problems were solved... Well, time will tell, if all.To sum up - If you're a complete noobie in terms of Warhammer lore, there's nothing here for you. You'll find other, better hex wargames in more familiar asthetics. In the other hand, if Horus Heresy means something to You, you'll find a bit of fun here. Just don't expect a complex, tactical game - Battle of Tallarn is quite basic."

I'm a big HH and Iron Warrior fan, and there was little fluff which was also disappointing. I'd return it if I could.I almost forgot about the bugs. This game crashes or goes unresponsive often, and I guarantee it's not my rig."
76561197970435474,Recommended,515980,29794535,Posted: 8 February,all,Vargas78,"Not bad, whilst it suffers a bit from it's ios-like feel compared to more polished pc only titles, i've still found it an entertaining turn based strategy game based during the horus heresy era which is a setting I like that's often underrepresented.Pros:a.i. seems decent enough.Quite a lot of units and weapons.Can redefine keys, which is an option a lot of ios type games+ports don't allow for.The RNG results don't seem too bad to me, but might need more time to know for sureQuite tactical, need to take into account line of sight and good deployment to maximise your forces firepower. Flank/rear attacks and distance seems to have an effect on damage and hit chance too, more so on some weapons than others, which i like.Fairly cheap.The campaigns can be played as both loyalists and traitors.Theres a decent number of standalone missions that can be played too.Negatives:Whilst interesting, campaigns are linear so there's probably not that much replayability once completed.Graphics and music feels like from 90's gaming (which isn't necessarily a bad thing for some people)Limited multiplayer options, appears to be only local (hotseat) hosting available.No undo move option if you accidentally move to the wrong hex.Lacking a map/scenario editor/maker so we can make our own content."
,Not Recommended,515980,30201414,Posted: 26 February,all,Dark Seraph,"The balance in this game is just simply unfair which is a shame because I really wanted to like this game, nine out of ten times your shots will miss or just do no damage. Enemy units seem to have every single advantage which from an Astartes point of view is to be expected but enemies can shoot through the fog of war and dreadnaughts just absorb fire like sponges. It is horribly unbalanced and I would not reccomend it to anyone until they rebalanced the game."
76561198042065216,Not Recommended,515980,29868060,Posted: 12 February,all,Warsmith Honsou,"This game is unpolished,Doesn't have multiplayer or map creator.Enemy units can shoot you when you can't see through the fog of war so you can't determine what unit to counter it with.Dreadnoughts just about one shot everything so just take them.Some maps are interesting while others you have very little choice of what you do.Terminators take enviromental damage with small health pool so are a liability, AI suicided a powerful unit against me.Got my money's worth but its not a good game."
,Not Recommended,515980,29906862,Posted: 13 February,all,Fulgrim,"terrible - even for 9 euros and if you dont care for visuals. terrible gameplay mechanics, terrible balance that becomes straight on unfair in late campaigns - even on easiest difficulty and terrible UI. both sanctus reach and wh40k: armageddon beat this pile of **** in every aspect."
76561197998331012,Recommended,515980,33766584,Posted: 24 July,all,Footfleas,"I know this game gets a lot of heat for being ugly, unbalanced (for the Traitor faction in particular) and troops missing ""all the time"" but it's really not that bad. Make no mistake, it's definitely taken a spill from the ugly tree hitting every branch on the way down, but Its a fun little game.Playing the ""unbalanced"" Traitors was actually the most fun for me, as it required much more planning and making desperate flanking maneuvers compared to the sledgehammer efficiency of the Imperium. And for me that works! As for the inaccuracy of troops I'm from the days of old school PnP RPGs and I've seen the dice make enough mockery of statistics to not even flinch when my troops appereantly forget to load their weapons with live ammo and seemingly just fires randomly into the air anyway. However, it's not my experience that the enemy faction is any better off. It's just blind luck at times which can be frustrating to some but for me it kinda' works (seeing the same thing on my analog 40k battlefields all the time anyway).So to sum up a short review... it's ugly, it's simplistic, and it's fun!If you can get it on sale, I would recommend giving it a shot (though you might miss ;P ). Not sure I'd pay full retail price though."

Your units miss every shot, even at point blank range, and even on the rare occasion you do hit something, the thinest armour will abosrb lascannons like a sponge soaks up water, on the other hand the AI are the finest marksman in the known universe, every shot rings out with eagle-eye accuracy, and it would also appear that your units have forgot to put on their armour this morning as every round blows through your units like hot♥♥♥♥♥♥on tissue!I dont think I'd recommend this game to anyone, there's probably better ways to spend £7..."

,Recommended,515980,29849206,Posted: 11 February,all,OsirisAU,"A good game, if not a bit basic.Compared to other Warhammer 40k/30k based Video Games such as Dawn of War ( a similar kind of game) it is a bit of a let down, although overall the game is fun.There isn't much ""strategy"" I've found so far, having played the Tutorial Missions and the first two segments of the First Strike Mission (Traitor), is that it is really predictable. Like, once you die, you know where everything is, so you can tailor your forces to deal with it. The only exception has been the Iron Hands Dreadnought mission, because the Imperial aligned Knights deployment seems to be random.Overall a fun, if not basic, game."

76561198010040405,Recommended,515980,29828818,Posted: 10 February,all,Der Katakan,"At first I was very sceptic, I thought it was an cheap Armageddon rip off. Just after playing a few scenario's I was not bored at all by the simpleness of the game, there are not much rules or complex structures in the game. Some scenario's are actually more challenging then I expected. It is a fun game and it is worth it's price. The ghrapic and music style are not so mine, but they are okay.  If you like this game I recommend Armageddon, which is more expended."

Hopefully the developers will add some extra scenarios and maybe the ability for units to gain experience and keep your veteran units from scenario to scenario. Veteran units could also obtain extra abilities like the crew being able to repair there damaged vehicle or better armor/defense. higher hit percentage, Stealth until fired...etc...etc. Of course the editor would come in handy and add longevity to the game 6.5/10(Lot of Promise)."

The combat system feels like it's random chance, doesn't matter how far you are from the target, what you're shooting it with, whether you're hitting it's rear, side or front armour 9/10 shots you take either come us as missed or no damage for seemingly no reason.
