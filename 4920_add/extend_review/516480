,Recommended,516480,32408447,Posted: 14 June,all,seph.au,"Bought on a whim one evening and had me glued to the screen, figured I owed the game a short recommendation. Excellent little platformer with a great soundtrack that can be played through in an evening or two. Absolutely nailed the controls and difficulty curve. Bonus is the 20 achievements, completing game nets another 'perfect'. Loved super meat boy but despised the difficulty? Pinkman is well worth a look. Sitting in your library from a bundle purchase? Give it a whirl! :D"

I suggest you buy it to have fun for a few hours!Pros- Cool background music- Runs well (Wouldn't expect anything else due to what kind of game it is)- I like the background change when you die (Different colours - Can make it harder when it's darker)- Simple, easy controls- Good game for people who like to SpeedrunCons- Aren't really any if im being honestRate it - 7.5/10"

In these levels, there are a bunch of obsticles and new gimmicks that get shown to the player and the more levels you complete, the harder it gets by combining these gimmicks.I would highly recommend this game even if it is just for an hour."

Due to this the levels are always looking interesting.The controlls are responsive and the ability to view the whole level prevents fail and error-gameplay up to a certain degree. Visiuals, music, and the minimalistic appeal are fitting.When the Level desing is at its best it creates a very nice flow. But some Level demand precise controlls, which are somtimes difficult with a gamepad. Also a few levels requiere you to wait for objects which interrupts the flow and is getting rapidly annoying after a few tries. Even though i respect the simple and minimalistic menu design, it would be nice if you couldturn off the wilhelm-scream andadjust the volume of the death sound. I suggest a visible configuration-file in the game folder.A nice, interesting and well crafted indie game.I really enjoyed it.Definitly worth the 99 Cents. so give it a try :)"

I'm sitting here trying to stop recording, but I just couldn't end it. It may be the art style, maybe even just the fact that it's an awesome platformer, but I loved every bit of this game. Although I'm only on level 29, just knowing that there's more levels (who knows what they'll offer) to this game makes me appreciate it more. And the music, man, that adds a lot more flavor to it no doubt. And it's not a difficult game, just a bit challenging, but not enough to where it'll make you rage quit. Just enough to where it really tests your platformer skills.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GrwTdVavvI"

The controls were pretty easy to handle. The first few levels are pretty easy but it gets more challanging with every level you pass. What made the game a great experience for me was the music. Being able to play this good platformer with amazing music giving you a very relaxed feeling was great to me. I'd defenitly recomend this!Here is the first part of my Let's Play:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0DRqwbIzaAAt the end of the video I ran into a bug.

,Recommended,516480,31168089,Posted: 15 April,all,Huyo,"Fun, simplistic platformer. About an hour and a half of gameplay. My biggest complaint is that you can't change the controls, (arrows to move, 'Z' and 'X' for actions) but fortunately there is controller support which makes it much more comfortable. No reason not to pick this up if you're a fan of platformers. As a hint 'C' (or 'X' if using an XBOX controller) let's you look at the whole level at once.P.S. Not sure if the dev will see this, but there is a typo on the final screen."

You don't have fall damage and a abillity glide or jump higher through the power of farting... Well... Although that it was obviously meant to be funny... it isn't. But the game is really fun and hard and I reccommend it to everyone that enjoyed the N-series of games and it is pretty cheap as well. There is no reason not to play this game for fans of N.

The level designs are creative and the changing music and color palette keeps things intersting even after repeatedly dying on the same level. The only problem is the red backgrounds makes it hard to keep track of your pink character. I found myself dying on purpose just to get a new color palette.

,Recommended,516480,29308638,Posted: 16 January,all,MastaCody of 99 Cent Gaming,"I personally purchased this game. I reviewed it for my 99 Cent Gaming series.Wow...I think there has been a gold standard set when it comes to games I've reviewed on my show. Ladies and gentlemen I present to you Pinkman, a very fun masochistic platformer that is in the same vein of Super Meat Boy, N+, and those before it.There is so much going for this title that being priced at a cool .99 (and cheaper if you get it during the first week) makes it almost criminal to not recommend. Everything from the controls to the gradual increase in difficulty to the introductions of new mechanics and obsticals are all done in a way to only help the player understand what exactly brought them their doom.Like many platformers of this kind, Pinkman offers very simple controls that support both keyboard and controller. I used controller in this case and the character handled very well and never felt too sensitive or weighty. In addition to moving and jumping you can utilize a jetpack (or ""fart"" if you perfer) to give an extra boost when trying to make up to other platforms or trying to avoid an explosive death.Never once did I feel like a death was cheap or unavoidable, something that could have easily been done to make players try over and over again to pad out play time. Every level I had played through for my review (1-35) felt fair, difficult, and fun which only made me want to keep playing once the video was over.Altough the graphics are very simplistic, they also help the player to keep focused on the obstacles at hand. There's never a distraction thrown at you from how it's designed. The sound is also amazing and it kept my adrenaline going even when I suffered a round of deaths on a few levels.If I had to nitpick, I wish there were options for recording how fast you beat a level. Games like this are a speed runners dream, and the lack of a time keeping mechanic just baffles me. Hopefully in a future update this can get added.I have more to save in the video below, but overall this was a joy to not only discover but to review. Controls were on point, everything seemed polished, and it felt like a game with a purpose. Was this worth the .99 cents: absolutely! In fact, I was in doubt I'd ever find a gold standard when it came to games around this price point. Now I hope that I'll find other games that can reach this level of 99 cent enjoyment. Definitely give this developer your support.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=himmyLacgcw"

Pinkman Is An Execellent Platformer Where You, Pinkguy Go Through Small But Challenging Courses And As You Get Further And Further The Game Gets More Creative And The Levels Get Harder. I Haven't Noticed Any Bugs So Far Except The Portal Hitboxes (In My Opinon) And The Game Freezes Randomly For No Reason. The Game Has Froze 3 Times Now And Its Definitetly Not My Computer Cause I Just Built Recently But The Game Freezing Is Not Too Bad At All Since You Dont Lose Your Progress. Another Sort Of Annoying Thing Is That When You Die And The Level Changes Colors It Can Be Hard To See Pinkguy Sometimes. But These Small Things Dont Ruin The Game At All So I Think You Should Buy It Cause The Price Is Very Reasonable. ( I May Update This Review In The Future If There Are Gonna Be More Updates To Pinkman Or If I Find Another Bug Or Something.)"
,Recommended,516480,29332121,Posted: 17 January,all,JimDeadlock,"2D action platformer with 100 levels. The quality of level design is excellent and imaginative, along with tight, responsive controls. New mechanics are introduced regularly and it feels fresh and challenging throughout. It's difficult but you always feel you can succeed with a few more attempts. Each time you die the level changes its colour theme, this doesn't have any significance to the gameplay but it is a nice aesthetic touch. Pinkman is always pink, of course!There is no settings menu but everything is already set up exactly as you would want it. Steam/Xbox controllers 'just work', the sound volume is set just right and it starts in fullscreen. Alt-Enter to switch to windowed and you can stretch it to any size you like. Controller X button to zoom the level view in/out, Y to toggle music (which is very good). The whole playing experience feels comfortable and satisfying. Other devs could learn a thing or two from this.Overall I highly recommend Pinkman, and at this price it's just plain rude not to buy it. I do wish I could play it on Linux though."

If you have played Celeste by Matt Thorson before, you will do just fine at the beginning.It's an action plataformer where you have to open doors, turn knobs and so on in order to progress. It is pretty simple but the game has a nice progression on the level design getting it harder each time with new doors to open or things that might kill you, as well as complicated designs that are hard to navigate into.BTW, fun fact! Watching the video on the store page, when the character does the ""second jump"" I thought to myself: huh, that looks like a fart. Little did I know that the game developer refeers to it as a fart inside the game. That was nice :)Great job, great game. Having lots of fun with it!"
