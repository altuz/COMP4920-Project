,Recommended,516590,25004379,"Posted: 18 August, 2016",all,Nefrai,"Just spent some time playing around in the game, and it looks very promising. I like the scale, the buildings look tall, it's fun to get up on top and teleport between rooftops.Couple things -- The game needs some optimization. I ended up dropping the graphics down to ""fast"" or even ""fastest"" due to stuttering when a lot of enemies are present. To give you an idea of this, my PC uses an i7-4790K CPU and a GTX1080. I would also suggest adding in a setting to lower detail around the edges of the screen, if your engine allows it (Similar to what Raw Data does, so you can have better graphics, but they drop in detail at the edge).- Please also consider adding in volume controls. It would be nice to be able to turn music down, but leave SFX turned up, for example. The simple options may just be due to being an early build of the game though.Overall, I like the game and really look forward to updates, and if you add multiplayer, it would really be a blast. I think your sales will also improve by leaps and bounds if you can add in multiplayer. I may not play this a lot right now, just because optimization is still needed to run the game smoothly.--Update after some game patches --Played a few more missions today, and since the updates it's much smoother. When I first played this, I had to leave graphics on lowest setting. Today I had it bumped up to max graphics and it was playable at that setting (GTX1080 GPU). I do get some frame rate stutter still on highest graphics when a lot is going on, but at least it's doing much better. Bear in mind I'm maxing the game out at this point. Originally I couldn't even play ten seconds at this setting, now I can go 3-4 missions and I feel ok. I may bump the graphics down a notch or two for smoothest gameplay, but I'm happy to see the progress made on this already."

If I had to compare to it anything so far it would be Raw Data.  You can go into buildings, on the roof, stick your gun out of windows to shoot...Ok, I'm going back into play.  I haven't tried anything other than Open Word mode...Yes, you heard that correctly.  No MP yet, but if it comes, this is going to be ridiculous.  Love this so far.  Edit  - I'm running this on an overclocked Titan Black and 4770k and can play it on Good.  I do get a little bit of juddering but it's very playable still.  I'm sure it'll improve so please don't trash this game.  It's a chance at something really special once they release an update.  Multiplayer would be amazing."

If they could just tweak it a little further it would be smooth as butter.Only one reason you would buy this game for now. To help dev and get it cheaper.In its current first release state it's very raw. Needs a ton of work.

It's got all the parts of the game separated and playable with new parts being added so they can integrate it all.Sure, it's got some hiccups now and again, the buildings have a hard time keeping up sometimes for rendering when you're high up and traveling fast with the jetpack (running a 1080 and I7-6800K so I'm fairly sure it's not my setup) and you do get the occasional fade out to Vive, but beyond that everything is smooth and enjoyable.As a caveat, the jetpack can be nausea inducing for some people that probably didn't think before they bought a VR set (duh...) so if you have a sensitive little tummy you might want to ... well, return your VR honestly and slap yourself, lol.But, the game is good!"

Move freely around the city and fight alone or alongside AI soldiers against rogue robotic AI units. Do not expect another AAA shooter from this, its still in early access and a little rough around the egdes. But its quite polished for early acess and is a lot of fun to play compared to most of the wave shooters and rail shooters currently around for VR. The game offers intense battles, freedom of movement (you can even get inside buildings and up on rooftops), cover based combat and environmental destruction. You really feel like as if you are at war.If the developer creates more of a narrated storyline, team vs team PVP multiplayer (and perhaps a coop mode) in the future this game will be awesome!"

It takes wayyyyy too much arm swing to move and the jumping swing does not always work. This often would be annoying, but worse than that I ended up clipping into buildings and walls and then would get stuck. It has a lot of potential, but ended up being way too frustrating to continue trying to fix or figure it out. I decided to refund it."

The controls are dead simple, weapons are simple, there's no need to collect ammo or reload.  There's no plot, there's nothing to stop you from doing what you want to do:  shoot **** up in a VR city.You can teleport nearly anywhere you'd like, then after a while the game unlocks the next level of freedom: the jetpack.  Your playing field moves into 3D where there's lots of flying threats and shooters on rooftops to go with the ground troops.  The controls are very intuitive and provide a nice balance between being able to perform any maneuver and getting lost midair.  Of course it can get really nauseating, particularly if you turn your body mid-flight or try death-from-above drops, but even if you get sick you'll be glad you tried it."

Played with Oculus Touch, i5-3570K 3.4 GHz, GeForce GTX1070. Graphic quality is adjustable in Game on the fly. I played almost on the highest graphics setting with no framerate drops and any other problems.The Playground / MapYou play in a town with skyscrapers locked under a force shield dome. Some Buildings and Shops can/must be entered to complete the wave assignment or to unlock a new weapon. Somtimes thes are at th rooftop. You can teleport to higher ground also. You have enemies in the Ground and in the Air. Use your hud to get all enemies (red dots). You get different weapons and can switch weapons during gameplay in each hand seperately.Jetpack and Motion SicknessI would suppose you wait with deciding if this game is for you or not, until you unlock the Jetpack! You will get it in about 30-45 minutes of gameplay. Thats a real turning point!IF you DO NOT get motion sick (like me), this game is for you and you will have fun with it - Promise! It's really awesome to fly the streets and rooftops like a Rocketman or Super Hero :)Overall...A really fun an great experience!

It looks better ( & way more immersive ) ""in game"" than the screen shots demonstrate.Granted I've got settings cranked up to ""spectacular"" on a 980ti OC'd & hardly ever experience dropped frames (with TONS of enemies & frantic action). There is some visual anomalies going on when lots of baddies on screen & action (like blurring/fuzzy rendering for those areas) when things are going full-out... however it's not showing that it's dropping frames (which is good) so hoping/expecting this will be polished/fixed.It's really everything I'd been looking forward to: structured missions, open world, & frantic (as you like -again, can hide/snipe/run).If this were multi-player / co-op it would probably best the most purchased & played new game on the market.Devs have routinely posted updates - so that's also great news.It's EA title, but so polished & completely playable & enjoyable as it is now.If you like: fast paced shooters, open world, destructable environments - I'd highly recommend getting on board with this game.Once either co-op or multiplayer is added, I think that the popularity/exposure will skyrocket on this one."

In contrast to most other VR shooters, this one is open world - well in this case it's open city ;) That means there is no linear level, but a few blocks of a city, with roads, alleys, houses and roof tops. You can simply go everywhere, even into some houses. On the streets there are parked cars, that can be destroyed and you can take cover behind a lot of objects. Your enemies are flying drones and bipedal robots and all come in several types with different look and weapons. Your weapons are (as far as I discovered them) automatic pistols, automatic rifle and sniper rifle and using them feels good and a lot of fun! The game offers several game modes, but I tested only the first two: the missions and open world. In the missions you are give a specific task and after completion you are given the next one. In open world it's simply you in a city full of robots and you need to survive as long as possible. Although I haven't completed all of them yet, I enjoyed the missions very much!But my absolute favorite part was the jet pack! A jet pack in VR can make a lot of people sick if done the wrong way. But in this game they did a perfect job! You can fly in any direction, have nice ""dog fights"" with the drones, attack the ground bound enemies (robots and spiders) and there is no motion sickness at all! I tend to feel motion sickness from all sorts of sliding movement, especially if it is accellerated or slowing down. This game makes it perfectly right: the speed of your movement only depends on the presure you put on your trigger finger, but there is no accelleration at all. So basically you move or you stop immediatly, which is not realistic as in air you would drift, but this way I can enjoy the game without any bad feelings in my stomach!"

It's the type of game I imagined in the mid-nineties when VR was all over movies, and it still seemed so far away.The graphics are bland - doesn't matter.The AI is basic - doesn't matter.The guns are limited (so far) - doesn't matter.It's so freakin fun to run around a few city blocks shooting at waves of enemies, going where you please, with unlimited ammo and absolutely no reloading. It's pure, unadulturated arcade fun, like the 90's never left and that same, original dream of VR actaully came to life.The only issue I have so far is with performance. I have to turn the settings down very low to keep from getting nauseous while I play, and I'm running a 6700k with a GTX 1070. I don't care that the graphics are bland, but I feel like I shouldn't have to lower everything so far just to get a steady 90 frames. Additional graphics options would go a long way here, I feel.

The map reminded me alot of The Division, lots of places to go but often its just a place to be.The concept of ammo, or even loot drops, would be a great reason to explore rather than just kinda fly about and rain terror for the sky.Also I REALLY dislike the HUD and mini-map being glued to my face, I would love them to be moved to an arm situation, as I can't pull the mini-map up closer to look it over when its just stuck there."

Survival mode allows you to move around a pretty big area and fight hordes of robots. Teleport movement at first but you do unlock a jetpack pretty quick that makes the game orders of magnitude more fun.However you quickly run out of new weapons to unlock (you can't seem to dual wield most of them either). And whats more the enemies really platau in terms of difficulty and pretty soon there's no challenge whatsoever in the game. I think this is because it seems to spawn waves of enemies, and no wave is ever too much. Ideally a game like this should ramp up the difficulty exponentially.It reminded me a lot of Earth Defense Force, running around a low-poly city destroying monsters. As it stands it's a decent enough arcade experience, but there's not a lot of difficulty there.

I watched a presentation by the develepor at the RTP VR meeting in Durham, NC last night and tried his game during a demo afterwards. I was amazed with the quality and play during the demo and it reminded me of the thrill of Space Pirate Trainer which has been a favorite since I bought my Vive in April. Only in this game you are not confined to a single room-scale area. I'm greatly impressed with the playability of CyberThreat and after only one hour-long session (I only stopped because I managed to kick my cord out of the plug). The jet-pack movement option is really thrilling to play and gives some really new combat strategy I haven't experienced before in any other FPS. And it's FUN! This is the kind of VR experience we've been waiting for - flying through the sky like almost no one (except experimental jetpack pilots) has ever done. The developer chose to have the enemy targets be non-human drones and robots, but these targets provide a fun challenge even at the early levels. Interestingly, the game seems very similar to the upcoming Epic Games Robo Recall. But, I can tell already CyberThreat will compare favorably despite the lower fidelity of his 3D content and graphics settings. It's just too fun! I highly recommend this game already in early access if you like first person shooters."

The open world is the best I've played in VR (plus, who doesn't love blowing up cars).  I loved the first time I had soldiers fighting around me.

,Recommended,516590,26349675,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,LiquidAvatar,"This is by far the most challenging VR game that I've played from a ""VR Legs"" perspective, but it's also the first game where movement in the game really clicked for me.  It starts you off with akimbo machine laser pistols, then proceeds to make you feel even more badass from there.  Teleportation is a nice and easy way to move in this game, but it swiftly gives you a jetpack that changes everything.At first, I got really disoriented and a little bit nauseas when using the jetpack to fly around, but suddenly it clicked for me.  When I was a teenager, I used to wake board; this was like that.  I could point my controller in the direction that I wanted to be towed and I'd soar off in that direction.  I was wake boarding without gravity, and it was amazing.  I soon found myself doing strafing runs at groups of robots, banking around turns as I wove through alleys and between trees.  Not that banking is required, as there's no momentum in the game, but leaning and thinking of it as if I had momentum made it super fun and just totally work for me.I've really enjoyed the game in its current state (0.0.7 ) and can't wait to see what cool additions make it into the game as it grows."

It's the closes to COD in VR I've seen, except that it lags.I have a fairly powerful machine (3.3GHz CPU, Nvidia 1080, 32GB RAM, FIOS), but the lagging is bad enough to make me stop playing after a short time.Now I know how Rift folks feel all the time...Still, I do recommend it.

76561198116304836,Not Recommended,516590,32797433,Posted: 25 June,all,Aerowyn,Until performance can get fixed I can't recommend this one.. With a 1080ti and 7700k with zero supersampling I can't keep a stable framerate when a bunch of robots are flying around even with graphics all the way down to 2(which looks really awful). I had this same issue with my old system many months ago with a 1070 and 2600k and now a brand new system same thing so I highly doubt it's just my system.  I honestly would love to see frame timings of a system running this at a steady FPS when fighting robots with graphics at 4 or higher.

Holy batballs, Nutman. Once I got the jetpack, something clicked and I fell in love with it. I totally see where they're going with this.

It has a ton of open world missions to blast your way through, each more challenging than the next.  Although very fun, the game does feel repetitious with the same robots and drones attacking wave after wave. Would love it if the game was online multiplayer too.

76561197972572144,Recommended,516590,29302316,Posted: 16 January,all,CptTangerine,"I have played this game for an hour or so (which is more than enough time to get an initial impression of it).  This is not the deepest of games in terms of gameplay.  There are robots, they are shooting at you.  Shoot them.  That's basically it.Now, I'm not saying that this is not an enjoyable game, it is.  It's a pretty arcadey shooter and there's nothing wrong with that.  The graphics are of a reasonable level even at this stage, there are plenty of robots to shoot, and the guns are pretty good fun.Is it worth £11 at this stage?  Yes.  Providing some things will be fixed later on.The basic functionality of the game works fine as it is at the moment but I am experiencing a lot of graphical glitches.  The main glitch is the missing building glitch.  The buildings seem to pop randomly in an out of visibility both to me and to NPCs.  I am finding that there are a lot of times when I'm being shot at but nothing is whizzing past me.  I return fire at the small stick figure hanging in mid-air and my bullets don't reach them.  It's only when I get closer that (sometimes) a building will pop into existence between us.   The game is early access, I understand that, and it's just one of those early access things.  I'm sure it will be ironed out in the near future.Movement controls are good.  You can use slide locomotion or teleport and the speed for the slide locomotion can be set in the options.  I have heard quite a few people complain about motion sickness but I have the constitution of a concrete elephant so I'm not the best person to judge.  Feels fine to me.  I could see that some people may get a little sick when the jet-pack is introduced but, again, it isn't causing me any problems.  I would love to see the jet-pack controls made more like a real jet-pack so that it is controlled using both Vive controllers - this would make shooting while using the jet-pack very difficult but I could live with that.  At the moment it all feels a bit on-rails, there's no bobbing or having to juggle power between up and forward, or anything like that.  You pull the trigger to go in a direction and point the Vive controller.  When you take your finger off the trigger you just stay hanging where you are.  I would like it a bit more involved than that, but as I say, it is an arcade shooter.My only final comment is that it would be good to have a volume control in-game.  At the moment, with my current set-up, the volume is really, really loud.  I can cope, but I would like to be able to turn it down.I would definitely recommend shelling out a tenner on this game.  It is bound to get better and it's good, fast-paced fun.  There are plenty of game modes: open world, a campaign of sorts, defence mode, and some sillier ones.All-in-all, not back for this stage in development."

Highly recommend, its a game I keep coming back to!This VR experience just gets better & better! My fav VR game by far! The scale and atmosphere is truly amazing, this coupled with brilliant immersive effects, shattering glass, explosions & damage and freedom of movement makes this truly epic! If you want crazy paced action or if you want to be more strategic tackling the various Cyber threats, the choice is yours! Great choice of weapons & challenging enemies. The AI soldiers on your side are  brilliant, find myself trying to protect them, can only imagine what this would be like in multiplayer!
