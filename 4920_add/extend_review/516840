With humorous dialogue and intuitive puzzles, this is one of the best pointy-click adventure games I've had the pleasure of experienceing. I'll definitely be purchasing the next installment, whenever it comes out.EDIT: The achievement bug has been fixed. Thanks to the developer for their quick response!"
,Recommended,516840,25788868,"Posted: 30 September, 2016",all,Oats,"Going to be honest, I didnt care what this game was - I was buying it just for the word ""dragon"".But I'm really happy I spent that £2.50. Good art, great voices, a little short but we all know size doesn't matter all that much (PLUS it has a dragon). I love the humour and I'm curious as to where the story is going.I found this game while looking through the steam market results for ""dragon background"", I stumbled upon Norb and I HAD to buy the game. And I'm glad I did.Can't wait for Episode 2."

The Tale of Doris and the Dragon: Episode 1 was without a doubt the best Point and Click game that I've played in a long time. The artwork, the characters, the gameplay and the story are all amazing, and I'm looking forward to the next episodes!"
,Recommended,516840,25425779,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,Davjo,"The Tale of Doris and the Dragon - Episode 1appears to be a game first seen on good ol' Newgrounds, bearing a quite short, yet immersive experience of an old lady (who is not immediately aware of their own death, which appeared to happen in possibly sinister circumstances), following her journey through the void and afterlife in hopes of meeting up with her husband once again, this time with updated visuals.A rather annoyed, yet very helpfulbritish dragonwill assist you as much as he can, being able to be called at any time with a phone-like device that you obtain quite early on.Despite this game being rather short (and there really being only one part you can be stuck at if you lack knowledge in music, even if a specific other item gives you a rhythm), it still shows a bit of humor, especially in the terms of you being an elderly person.All in all, a quite enjoyable game despite being rather short-lived, easy to pick up and barely any ""nonsense-crafting"" like in some other Point-and-Click Adventure titles.You shouldn't forget to check the gorgeous artwork of the Steam Trading Cards too, my friend Darklitria has drawn the main menu background as well as these cards!"
,Recommended,516840,29473963,Posted: 24 January,all,BecDerp,"Lots of funny moments, lovely visuals, has some difficult sections to spice it and the story so far seems really awesome, with lots of questions needing to be answered! The episode itself is a little short but still good to pass the time with!"
,Recommended,516840,25741474,"Posted: 28 September, 2016",all,Tophy,"Short, but very good! The voice acting is genius, i personally laughed quite a few times. Soundtrack is great. Great puzzles even though i did struggle a bit sometimes, but the more challenging - the more fun. The text that rolls is honestly a bit annoying because it's really hard to read that way.It's all in all a great and original game, love the creativity behind the game, and it's definitely worth the 3,99€When is Episode 2 coming out?"
76561198115829784,Recommended,516840,26281967,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,frank2351,The humor of this game is cracking me up.Dialogs are well written and this style is unique. Voice acting is funny too.If you're into point and click adventures this title is worth looking into.If you consider it to be art more than anything else you're golden.The downsides:- very short game. You can beat it in an hour. Speedrun is less than 10 minutes.- some of the puzzles aren't very logical and you eventually end up with a 'try and error' approach to find solutions to puzzles some of which aren't intuitive at all (the flower in the basket)All in all it's a title to buy for a reduced price. It's well worth 2$ and i can't imagine people regret a purchase around that pricepoint.
,Recommended,516840,25435679,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,Snapdragon Syndicate,"This is the Steam Greenlight version of the Doris and the Dragon that was (and is still) on Newgrounds from last year. As far as I can tell, the biggest difference is that this version is fully voiced. There's also more dialogue and information overall, and the interface is easier to deal with.Very standard as far as point and click adventurers go. There are really only two puzzles in this brief (~1 hour) first installment, and both are simple but will take some fiddling. Not rage inducing, but perhaps squinted side-eye inducing. If you're into pointy clickies I assume you're accustomed to this and won't be miffed.It is short but it's also endearing, and I look forward to the future episodes being released."
,Recommended,516840,33245560,Posted: 4 July,all,Lumenwright,"I loved this story episode from the second I saw it, while looking for games about dragons. Finally, a story where an old woman gets to have a proper adventure and meet a friendly dragon! I got exactly what I expected: a short, endearing, straightforward homage to point-and-click adventures, with the kind of story and characters I always wanted to see. It felt like rediscovering a favourite little cereal box bauble from twenty years ago.Of course, this retro experience includes all the frustrating little things, like feeling 'stuck' often and clicking and right-clicking and dragging every pixel on the screen to figure out what I was supposed to do. Each puzzle was relatively straightforward though, since there's only one or two puzzles you can solve at a time with your entire inventory. The game also has lengthy conversations that, though amusing, are hard to skip through until I figured out that you're supposed to ""use"" an item on a person, not ""interact"" with them, to give it to them. It's also hard to tell when a character has something new to say. I'm sure many of the less fun things will be smoothed out in the next episode, though.The music box puzzle was my favourite because I love music puzzles and bone/fossil xylophones, but it took me a while to figure out because I had sound effects turned off, because after a while the Fur Elise snippet playing every time I clicked on the box reminded me too much of all the times people wanted me to play it on the piano. I sympathize with the demon entirely. So basically I couldn't figure out why nothing was happening when I clicked on the ribs.I'm very glad that The Tale of Doris and the Dragon is being told. It's the kind of pure, snarky, cute adventure I always wanted, with just my type of humour. Its ""clunkiness"" doesn't get in the way of the story. I'm very much looking forward to Episode Two!"
,Recommended,516840,26550557,"Posted: 11 November, 2016",all,AuldWolf,"An unexpected treat, a joyously little thing, and with such great voice acting. It reminded me of what I loved about Pratchett, and it caught me off guard by sharing a more fleshed out view on Grant Morrison's concept of the purpose of a Universe. All in all, lovely. Fun characters, great voice acting, and just an overall sense offun.Really, really good job. I couldn't praise you enough, despite how short it is. Loved it right down to the stylised visuals that reminded me of Another World.Please make more."
76561198011447144,Recommended,516840,26364995,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,[bd]JohnnyPneumatic,"Entertaining and well-written.  There's not a lot of content - a handful of puzzles and about 45 minutes of gameplay, but it's definitely worth the handful of change I paid for it.  The characters are interesting and surprisingly well-developed, and I hope Arrogant Pixel makes a boatload of money so they can make the rest of the episodes."
,Recommended,516840,33268286,Posted: 5 July,all,❤SandyDragginz,Point and click adventure for you to figure out what needs to interact with what...Norb is soo cute and cool. I wish he was my Pet. It was great..part 1 was very short...I can't wait to see what happens in Part 2!
76561198110725258,Recommended,516840,29559347,Posted: 29 January,all,Topsty,"Disclaimer: This Review may contain small spoilers pertinent to the plot of this Point and Click Story. Edit: lots of spelling errors but im too lazy to fix them B)Let me start of that Im completely down for a game like this. Grandma ends in puragatory, has to scoot around with a terribly uncomfortably-looking tiny grocery cart, fighting daemons, and exchanging dialogue with a witty (english accent and i cant fussing remember if its scottish or irish) dragon sitting a desk job. Talk about stories that you even consider anyone could think. However, even an outragous story can produce some of the finist world-building even if its small. Lets talk pros and cons, however im afraid there will be more cons :(.Pros: Artwork-wise Id say this was great jab at pixel-animation. For the most part, it was smooth, pretty, and gave the world the sense of size parallel to the story.Music: I dont know who rights it, but the soft tone and simplicity of the game's music really captured the mood of how mysterious and vast that this ""Purgatory"", this world that the Doris has been stuck in, really is.Cons: Voice Acting: I really do love some of the voicing acting in this game, but alot of the few characters they introduce, not so much. On the top of my head, I believe the Doris, the Ferryman, and the Daemon (crap thats like 75% of them) are the ones I felt had the most unconvincing voices and lines in the whole story.Dialogue: I didnt get a whole lot of passion in the character line's. Sometimes the tone is more passive and neutral and doesnt serve to pull the player into the story, it felt like i was listening to one of those middle school essay reports where the student, who really doesnt like speaking out in front of he classes, blazingly skims through his report in the most blandest monotone ever. Now this DOESNT MEAN all the dialogue is bad, its just alot of it didnt match what the character should have been feeling.Another annoying habit ive noticed is that when you need to reneter a conversation with a character, you have to start over FROM THE BEGINNING to find that piece of information you MIGHT have missed, and then it becomes tedious and redunant because you end up skipping alot and spamming that mouse button to get through.Controls: Point and Click stories have this one nasty habit of playing a game, tedious and frustratiing and that's having to click on the spot you want to do. I believe this ito be bad mechanics to implement into the game because the player ends up spending to much time getting frustrated to moving Doris to a specific part of the map to reach that one specific item you need but have to be precisely nearby it. I would reccomend the devs allowing the use of keyboard motion rather than click-and-drag so that players can focus more on immersing into the story rather than quiting the game because the controls make no sense to them.Puzzles: Thinking back to the old school point and click adventures, when all the items you picked up during the progression of the game didnt start to make sense why they were there in the first place until you gathered more items and then figured out how the went together. While this does make the game make you go the extra mile to put literally every item with another to make every combination you can think of until something happens, it does give you enough visual clues as to the significance of these items and doesnt baby you the entire game.Another Puzzle issue I had was the very end SPOILERWhen you are inside the daemon's body and trying to escape you find a music box that plays a small tune for which you have to replicate by hitting the poor monsters ribcage to duplicate the tune. Now im tone-deaf, and im sure maybe other people are so i could not for the life of me figure out this puzzle to the point where i had to watch a video to solve.You gave players a puzzle with few visual and auditorial clues other than the music box playing the song.I know it might be considered a small issuse, but im sure that many people were dissapointed about how non-complex the puzzle was and how it relied on sound cues to solve when most people dont always have the greatest ears.A thumbs up for the game because I know that it still impressed me just for an episode 1. Its not all that expensive and every penny spent on this game helps the devs improve onto newer episodes to come. Peace! ;3(also kinda bias cause i love dragons :)"
,Not Recommended,516840,31325203,Posted: 23 April,all,NyappiCat,"I don't have much to say about this game, the episode was quite short and the puzzles were not too tricky. The character designs for the dragon and the demon are cute. The music is nice and sets a nice tone for the game. Unlike games such as Undertale, I don't think the pixel graphics are used to the game's advantage, but rather makes it look very basic. It's not a bad game, but there's nothing special about it. Not too sure whether I'll buy the next episode."

I think we all know someone just needs a nice coffee and a couple nights off work, haha.I'm looking quite forward to episode two. This game has an interesting introduction and I'm liking the story and humor so far!"

Somewhat Monty Python like in human- very enjoyable. Only major complaint is a puzzle towards the end of the game that was nearly game-breaking in terms of Moon Logic Difficulty. Cannot wait for the next episode!"

76561198273267787,Recommended,516840,31910184,Posted: 22 May,all,Ugonhavabadtime,"This game was fantastic!  I loved the humor and the characters and the voice acting was delightful.  This tale was charming and it's great to play as an elderly character rather than the young characters I have come to expect.  The visual design was quite nice too.At the same time, this game is not worth 4 dollars.  It is far too short for that.  Also, there is one puzzle that is rather difficult to complete if the player is deaf or if the player does not know how to interact with items in his or her inventory.  Something needs to be done to show how to interact with items in that way within the game.I would 100% reccommend this game, I just suggest purchasing it on sale.  I cannot wait for an episode 2."
