Even with all the errors and typos having been fixed (I was originally playing a version without the edited script) you’re still left with stiff, awkward sentences, dry dialogue, and a complete lack of any attempt at innovation. And if it’s fanservice you’re after, you’d be better off just looking on Deviantart, since these parts are forced into the game with all the grace of an ice-skating centipede trying to go in a straight line.CharactersThe characters are cardboard cutouts. Kayo, our tsundere, is the only one that vaguely interested me when she spoke about her reasons for disliking Nayoko, the standard “flirty and fun” girl. Other than that, they’re boring and forgettable, just another two anime tropes that don’t get along because they’re soooo different from one another, but still somehow fall head over heels for the same dull guy. The development of a relationship between the might-as-well-not-even-give-him-a-name-he’s-so-generic protagonist and the girls is forced and, again, boring. Grandpa was a nice dude though.ArtFinally, moving onto the aspect of the Sakura games that I’m sure is the only reason they gained any popularity in the first place; the art. The familiar shiny-boobed aesthetic is in play as usual, which I personally find quite pleasing. The CGs and backgrounds are pretty and vivid and the sprites are cute, it’s just a shame that they’re wasted on a game like this. Also, some of the Japanese-style music was good and matched the setting well, but we’re still treated to ridiculous comedy music during the ecchi scenes. Seriously, save yourself the time and money and just google “anime boobies” instead.Overall, if you’ve played any of the other Sakura games, you’ve already played this one. Unless you’re desperate for more, I’d give it a miss.Click here for the full review.Follow the Visual Novel Fans curator list!"
76561198006413390,Recommended,517000,35342971,Posted: 30 September,all,woosk,"This 10th title of the Sakura series from Winged Cloud feature a male protagonist Toru who recently inherited his family's legacy as a priest for a pair of shrines standing close to each other. While staying at his grandfather's house, he receives a visit from the resident guardian spirit of each of the two shrines - catgirls Kayo and Nayoko who show up at his house as uninvited guests and at his school as his classmates. Over the course of this visual novel, Toru's grandfather Mr. Akita will explain to Toru that his required task as a priest is to perform the Rites of Ascension to help Kayo and Nayoko become true spirits of the land during the Ascension Festival where one or both of the guardian spirits might eventually develop feelings for Toru.The story and plot is written like a romantic comedy with a share of humour and fanservice and has 3 nice happy endings, the background music by REN from the circle 'Bastat tail', artwork by Inma and Fatelinealpha and overall presentation are great. Reading through the storyline and dialogue and unlocking all CGs at gallery will take less than 10 hours. Recommended when at discount or bundle offer for fans of Winged Cloud who might be interested in collecting the titles in the Sakura series, a short romantic comedy with fantasy themes, fanservice, appropriate background music and great artwork in the trading cards, badges, emoticons and profile artwork in this game."
,Not Recommended,517000,25645752,"Posted: 22 September, 2016",all,Michael_SK,"Was kinda hoping for a different story... some diversity in the Sakura series, but I didn't get that. While the story is quite interesting, it's filled with plot-holes and a lot of questioning aspects. The art is always great with this series, but the sprites always seem to resemble other characters in previous games, sometimes also resembling personallities in previous games as well. Because of that, it can seem to be a copy-and-paste with a tweaked story.I guess you can't expect much out of overly-sexualized VN. Only great thing about this the art with backgrounds and event scenes. If you like this series, buy the game and check it out. If you haven't touched this series before, I can't recommend this to you (or anyone else who isn't a Sakura series enthusiast).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOMF5H0c88M"
,Recommended,517000,25488258,"Posted: 12 September, 2016",all,✩ Helenα ✩,"Well, Sakura Shrine Girls fulfills its promise: fanservice, fanservice everywhere. The art style is indeed really nice (I particularly love how this artist colors the character’s eyes) and the BGM fits the whole “comedy/romance/supernatural” atmosphere.The story is simple, but to be honest, if they had put some more effort, it could have been actually good? I liked the fact that Toru is a priest in training, that could lead to a larger and perhaps more interesting plot, I don’t know. I just have this feeling.There is only one thing I disliked: there are ONLY sprites for Kayo and Nayoko, the two catgirls that you can romance. Toru talks quite a lot with his grandfather, and what we get is plain text and a background. No sprites, no effects to demonstrate emotions, nothing. For a narrative this simple (like in all Sakura games, not too many details and just straight forward dialogues and descriptions), it got somewhat boring. Not only when talking with his grandpa, but every time Toru is alone or with another character besides the girls, it’s like that. I understand that it can be annoying to draw a non important character that will show up just a few times but really, it felt so… Empty.4/10, get this VN on a good sale and if you’re already a fan of Winged Cloud works. If you’re looking for a serious plot and character development, this VN isn’t for you."

You play as Toru, a priest in training who... discovers there might be more to this spirit thing than he expected. Two spirits are under his care, Kayo, a black-haired cat girl who is formal and graceful, and Nyaoko, a white-haired catgirl who is more... a free spirit. Through his actions and choices, he can end up falling in love with one or both of them. Sort of typical for a Sakura game.While I am beginning to get burned out by these things, I do have to finish what I started... and frankly, having acquired the bundle when it was 60% off, I really should complete my analysis of the set..."

Had likable love interests, and a pretty likable MC. I didn't find myself skipping any of the dialogue, me being genuinely invested in what this VN had to offer.It's by no means the best Sakura game, but one of the better ones.Solid 7/10"

,Recommended,517000,31694863,Posted: 11 May,all,The Angry Sakura Game Nerd™,"Sakura shrine girls is another one of the games in the sakura franchise that isn't porn centeric, but you definetely shouldn't miss out on. If you liked the fantasy-ness of sakura spirit, this game follows the same sort of Idea. if you aren't in the mood for a ultra-romantic dating sim and just want to hang out with or wife some furry shrine girls, bingo; this one is for you. not a whole lot of drama at all in this game, it stays pretty light-hearted and happy throughout and the endings dont make you feel bad if you ditched one of the girls for the other. as usual for the sakura games, the music is nice and doesnt seem to be really repetitive, and fits well with the game's overall asthetics.overall, if you are buying this for the porn and want to support the winged cloud team, do it. but if you are looking for a SUPER SERIOUS DRAMA FILLED ROMANCE VISUAL NOVEL avoid all sakura games. these VNs are meant to be enjoyed and give a comedic feel like a rom/com ecchi anime, not taken as seriously as a Triple-A title."
,Recommended,517000,25694271,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,Lumina,"The visual novel revolves around you having to take over your grandfathers job which is too look after the shrines, turns out there is a pact between yoru family and the spirits, there are 2 shrines each housing a a spirit and the spirits do not like each other, one being ""mature and responsible"" and the other being ""playful and unresponsible"" they have to keep all of spirits in check and your character has to look after them and the shrines. I enjoyed the story and liked the way our character is skeptical of spirits at the beginning but has no choice but to start believeing.It is a sakura game so as well as the good story you can expect scantily clad women and sexual flirtations and your guy a ""shy, respectful gentleman"" that is awkard around such. As I have said before about Sakura games; they are cheaper than going to the cinema to see a film and give me as much enjoyment if not more depending on the film; so it is worth the price in my opinion, the game like the others also has a album so if you do want to look at the pictures again after playing it you do not have to replay it just to see the pictures; which while they are not for everyone I enjoy the Sakura pics.If you like visual novels or a story that shows character development. you will enjoy this; if you are looking to have some fun and coming across the usual type of Sakura pics you'll enjoy this and if the pics are not to your taste than don't leave negative stuff about it as others do on sakura games; anyoine playing a Sakura game should know what to expect."

This is on the bland side of the Sakura series and nothing happens or sets this one apart from the others.Story is nothing. You're just a kid who one day becomes the head of the two shrines whch just so happens to have Spirits in them. They don't get along but luckily you're a facless protagonist and they are two horny kittens so little development is required.The Art is fine. Just wished it stayed away from the school setting more since this is called Sakura Shrine Girls. But the sexy scenes are not that worth it and feel so forced a lot of the time.Really this game is just boring, and probably should have been called Sakura Boring. Better than Sakura Beach, but then so is stepping on a broken Lego."

I wouldn't say it is a bad story at all it has its hooks and does keep you asking questions which for me keeps me engaged. The art style is also really fun and anime like so give it a check or just give my video a go if you want to see first hand what you would be getting into!

I am currently following the second path with Nyaoko, 1st being the Cat-girl Guardian Spirit Kayo.There seems to be 3 paths to take Kayo, Nyaoko and a harem path containing both girls.* Kayo is a very dignified girl who in training to become one of the spirit guardians of the land.* Nyaoko is a very laid back girl whom enjoys life and is a incurable prankster, and is another of the spirit guardians in training.* Toru is a young priest in training and is a medium whom will be working with these 2 girls.Each path seems to take about ~2.5 hours although I am a fast reader so may take others longer to play.It was awesome you also released this as a bundled version allowing people to collect all the series in one go.I greatly recommend this visual novel and other from the series if you like visual novels. I rate it 5 stars.I am currently working a CG unlocking guide and will be releasing it when complete. As most the rest of the series from winged cloud has trading cards I believe they may release those shortly to."
