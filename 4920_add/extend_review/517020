But I think it could be a great game if it was polished and the devs define its as the ""Call of duty"" VR game compared the ""ARMA"" style of Onward"

I was hoping this game would be just like onward but with respawns but its not. There is no idication at all that you are hitting someone or that you are getting shot. Until you die that is. then you know you were getting shot lol. No features at all. Game was thrown together quickly it seems. I would hold off on this game until they put more work into it.

76561198161877542,Not Recommended,517020,28089873,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,militant,"Just to make it clear to the friends of the developer who don't like my negative review, I am not recomending this game for a few reason and none of them have to do with anything but the state of Virtual Warfighter.1)The game was released in a pre alpha state just to compete with Onward and it was broken because of it, from launch day (3rd of sep) up until a couple of weeks (start of November) back this game was completely non functioning. I actually playtested the game just before release and it was broken then too (unplayable due to network problems), when i asked at the time about a release schedual i was told it by the dev he didn't know and he still had lots to do. Then a week later when Onward announced their release date Virtual Warfighter just happened to announce there's too and it was to be a few days after Onwards release. On release the network code was still broken and no body could connect online, to top it off the dev still isn't sure things are fixed which he talks about in this thread because no one is connecting (but that could be because no one is playing it).https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/5ff90d/virtual_warfighter_update_25_released/2) Which brings us to point two that nobody plays the game and i mean nobody EVER plays this game and for an online only multiplayer game it's kind of very improtant that people play it. At it's peak it has had 7 players online (that was when the game was broken btw) but since release it has only had 4 or 5 unique players which consists of the devloper himself and atleast 2 of his playtesters (MulleDK and Exohop on reddit) meaning it's whole community seems to be the dev himself and friends. Which he also admits in the reddit thread i posted in point 1.http://steamcharts.com/app/517020#1m(website tracking people who play this game)3) Content wise this game is absolutely bare bones, there are no constistant updates and at one point in September the dev said they were going to be weekly. Since then he has taken 2 months to fix the network problems and released one map and one game mode to pad the already thin offering. For a $25 game this is not even close to good enough and this brong us to our next point.....4) Future content is to be going tactical game modes like Onward which is not where i was expecting or wanting this game to go. As of the end of November the future content plans are only for tactical game modes, first person hands and maybe weapon attchments in the future. This is not good enough, the game is already barebones and it's future planned updates look bleak at best, there is no mentions of maps, weapons or other features.  Not to mention I feel like there is a lot of people who don't like the tactical gameplay of Onward which is a niche market treaditionally and it seems like there is a gap in the market for an arcadey shooter. Yet never being advertised as being a tactical shooter VW now seems to be focusing its future content on Onward style gameplay.https://trello.com/b/S2fn1V0h/virtual-warfighter-issue-tracker(""future update list"")To top it all off there are a few people here who continually go around praising this game and telling people to buy it too, these people just happen to be friends with the devs and help him playtest it regularly too. I find this disturbing because of the simple fact that the game was at the time not working and as the dev admitted himself, he is not sure it's fixed. Yet for some reason these people run around rubbishing Onward and accuse anyone who says anything negative about VW of being onward fanboys (as you see bellow in the comments).Personally i have no attachment to either game and i think the numbers of people playing teach game and the sales speak more about the quality each respective game then i ever could. Onward has a thriving community, VW is a broken mess with no community."
,Not Recommended,517020,29812910,Posted: 9 February,all,HardCoreVR,This is a great game and could be the =of VR (hardcore) COD...But nobody seems to be playing online.+The controls are immursive and it offers a great combo of roomscale/locomotion movement.+ Graps are sharp and clean and the sence of scale is great and immusive.-It seems to be impossable to find players.

This should be a .99 game.Let's start with seeing the vive controllers in game, because completely kills immersion.Next, there are the white circles to hold your gear, which couldn't feel more unrealistic and cheap.Why in the hell would you people have a forward button and then use your head to define the path that you travel on? It should be following the direction of the controller, which is just common sense.The sounds are bad, the position of weapons for holo sights to line up are horrible, even the lobby is garbage - I could really go on and on....Oh and did I mention... NOBODY IS EVER ON IT TO PLAY WITH. An online multiplayer game that has no players, what a concept...DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE unless you want to gain appreciation for other games and are just looking to see how bad things can get in an FPS VR game, because this is definately a bottom of the barrel game."

I started my own server to check it out for 10 minutes. The movement is tied to your head, which is awkward. No side stepping is annoying. I had problems grabbing weapons and items off my belt.It is a shame, I really like the idea of a more arcadey shooter in VR. Onward is great, but I often crave some deathmatch with respawns for instant gratification."
,Not Recommended,517020,25411440,"Posted: 8 September, 2016",all,PapaBiddies,"It's unfortunate because this game looks like it has potential to be a great game and has appeal for people who like more of a respawn and less tactical shooter than Onward but in it's current state (yes, I'm aware that it's in Early Access) is unplayable. The player base just isn't there. When I did find a match I was playing against an invisible player and all I could see was a floating gun.I'd consider picking this up in the future on a steam sale if the player base is there and the bugs are squashed.TLDR - It has potential but isn't anywhere near playable at this point."

It's like onward on a smaller map.In terms of value, it's the most early access title I have ever seen. It's incredubly empty. It's a terrific demo. But come on, the price is insane. Look at QuiVR. You have a 5-10$ game here in my opinion.I encourage you to try it. Early access is not kickstarter.Edit: The dev is active and the game is now functional. I want Onward locomotion. I want more gun, more maps and more people playing."
,Not Recommended,517020,25308994,"Posted: 2 September, 2016",all,[RIP] SpaceBaldy,Sorry Devs - this is more of a demo that a game.Needs some polish and more content even before it becomes early access.Movement is via gliding wherever you are looking and doesn't feel natural (made me feel motion sick even with my cast iron stomach).
,Recommended,517020,25503926,"Posted: 14 September, 2016",all,Morten,"YES. H3VR meets Onward.Not a lot of players atm. (in fact, I haven't played with anyone but myself yet), but when people scream REFUND and BAD REVIEW the moment they realize that early access actually means EARLY access, no wonder the player base doesn't grow.H3VR has great weapon interactions, but the developer refuses to implement multiplayer.Onward has multiplayer, but terrible weapon interactions (guns are glued to your hand, so you can't drop them, take out your sidearm with the other hand while your rifle is equipped, etc.).Virtual Warfighter has both multiplayer and realistic weapon interaction. Just like H3VR, you can actually pull the pin of two grenades and throw them at the same time, or even pick up dead enemies' weapons and dual wield rifles, etc.If people buy this, and don't just frantically refund it the moment they spot one bug, or can't find a game, this game will grow to be something awesome.If you have any questions about the game, you can find me on the unofficial Discord server for the gamehttps://discord.gg/ztu5d9K"

Being a direct competitor to Onward, this game offers matches where you ACTUALLY get to play more, without the need to wait for the next round once dead. With the addition of voip and maybe a few changes to the movement mechanic, this will be a go-to VR shooter. This game also runs great, even on my under powered machine running a gtx770 (unlike onward)."

It's early days, for sure (as I write this, the game's only been out a few hours), so the game scope is limited, but what there is works well and seems bug free.  The developer seems to be of the philosophy that the game should release with a small number of features that work well, rather than lots of features, all riddled with bugs.  This is a philospohy i can respect.The game seems to be geting compared to ""Onward"" a lot, to it's detriment.  Some people seem to be leaving bad reviews simply because this game isn't exactly like Onward.  That's absurd.  They're different games. One guy was even complaining about lack of players, hours after the game released!I'm looking forward to watching this game grow and develop.  It's got great potential.  The problems it has (the locomotion system needs some tweaking) are easily fixable, and I'm sure new content will be coming along shortly."

I like the small map and being able to respawn. I'm more of a COD player so while I like playing Onward I'd rather have something with a faster pace which is why I'm always going back to Raw Data. This game has a ton of potential. The only thing I didn't like was the movement system because as far as I can tell there is no strafing. You can only move where you're looking. I'd like to see something closer to Onward. Great job devs and looking forward to updates.
,Recommended,517020,25393168,"Posted: 7 September, 2016",all,B3NNYZOOSE,"Bought this to support the vr fps genre more then anything and to hopefully keep the developer working on it.The graphics are pretty good I'll say that along with the weapon mechanics so far but the character movement definitely needs work I'll agree with most other people there and there will need to be more maps and weapons added but in saying that well thats why I got it to support the development so keep up the good work.EDIT - Further thinking about the game I hope that there is an option to turn the controls into hands if you wish and allow those ""hands"" to stabilise the weapons when firing (like in another certain VR game lol) and some small player created arena damage/affects aka bullet holes those little things would improve the realism a fair bit I'd like to think in the future.Cheers"

There are some issues with colision detection, some bugs that cause you to lose your weapons if you colide with walls or containers, and ocassional blackouts where you can't see a thing. So far there not many people playing, and the content is limited: one map, one rifle, one sidearm, one type of grenade... no comms ingame, and lack of team based game modes.    The menu is quite succinct, but it has a multisampling and anti aliasing setting which lets you improve the overall visual quality quite a lot (if your rig can handle it..)  The fov-comfort setting is also very useful, although I haven't tried higher comfort settings as I have strong VR Legs and do not tend to nauseate with natural locomotion.This is a very early release and there's  a lot to improve and build, but I am quite sure that this game will grow into something really special and I personally can't wait to see the game and the userbase grow."

You spawn, and depending on how close to enemies, you might get into a firefight right away. The weapons are great, but I need a tutorial to reload...      there is a so much potential for this game. after playing Onwards, sometimes I just want to get in there and shoot (or get shot), and this game does it. Very similar locomotion and graphics. I highly recommend, as it's a blast but still with much more content to come. It still needs voice chat, tutorials, but it's pretty exciting."
,Recommended,517020,25701831,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,BeerN'Cheese,"I can never find anyone to play with.I do, however, think it's awesome.The only thing I'd suggest is to allow the touch pad to also control strafing. I find myself turning my head to look and naturally moving my thumb to the side of the pad to keep my body moving in the same physical direction. If there is a way to enable this, can someone tell me?Also, visuals are blurry on the the gun logos/branding, and when looking down the sights. I've read on how to adjust my vive and such, but I thought perhaps there's also a way to increase aliasing within the game?Overall 7/10 experience. I'd rate higher if I could experience multiplayer; and even higher if the strafing was including into the touch pad controls. The over visual fidelty isn't terrible, any counter-strike fans would find no flaws in how this looks. It does a great job of creating presence, but some of the sound effects are a little too loud or too quiet. One thing that I found slightly aggravating, but wouldn't necessarily say is game-effecting.. is that I, personally, find it difficult to put weapons or items back on my person when trying to switch out.I do recommend for anyone looking to say they have ""CoD"" in vr."

I'm going to recommend this ons as if the devs give this some attention and work with the community it has promise to be a fast paced, quick turnover shooter which is the kind of VR experience needed, Buy it, support it, constructively criticise it and it should be worth it - and you'll have had more practice with it than those annoying kids that dominate you at COD!"
