76561198287587698,Recommended,517130,25770654,"Posted: 29 September, 2016",all,CrappyScientist,"Holy moly. This was great. I don't want to say it is better than Audioshield, it is just a little bit different.First the bad: I encountered a bug where some videos would slow down, and the sound was distorted. You could also see the timer went slower, so.. memory leak perhaps? Other videos worked great.Audioshield vs Soundboxing:If you like Audioshield, you will enjoy this game as well. In the latest update, Audioshield discontinued Soundcloud support and implemented Youtube instead. Audioshield also has an automatic beat detection feature for unplayed songs, where Soundboxing is manual. The good thing about Soundboxing, is that you can create a completely new ""beat map"" if you don't like the existing one.Intensity intensifies:Audioshield has a nice feature where you can choose difficulty, and you can also find mods online to replace the existing difficulty settings.In Soundboxing you need to kind of figure out the difficulty level yourself. If you see a song that is 3:20 minutes, but it has 600+ beats / punches, then you know it will be intense. So that gives you an idea of how difficult the song is. If no one has played that song before, then (some will say unfortunately) you need to make your own beat map. You need to stand and punch at the beats however you see fit.MissingIn the future, I would like to see the following:FavoritesGenre selectionRegion based high scores"

Anyone who has played VR will instantly start having fun the moment they try the game without a tutorial.Songs are all player created, which results in notes being synced up with the rhythm much better than Audioshield.Creating songs is easy and requires no outside editor. Simply playing a song freeform will result in the songs notes being created from your punches.CONS:Very low skill ceiling, if you have ANY experience with rhythm games you will have no trouble acing even the hardest songs with only a tiny bit of practice.User created songs can be dull or outright bad if the author of the song doesn’t have rhythm or try to improvise dance moves.Reliance on YouTube for songs makes it difficult-impossible for those in countries that block YouTube videos (Germany) or people without consistent internet to play.SUMMARY:Soundboxing, in essence, is a hybrid of precision rhythm games like DDR, and dancing rhythm games like Dance Central. While you are still hitting a sequence of notes, you also feel like you are naturally dancing to the beat; more so than any other rhythm game I’ve played. Anyone can easily jump in and have a good time because at its base the game is insanely fun. That being said the game does lack a skill ceiling as even the hardest songs in the game are easily playable to anyone with any skill in rhythm games. While it’s not the most depth filled rhythm game, it definitely shines as a cheap, fun party game that easily belongs in everyone’s Vive repertoire."

,Recommended,517130,33881488,Posted: 29 July,all,Dr.Unfähig,"Soundboxing is not just a game, its a workout!Playing Soundboxing will get very exhausting especially for your arms and it will definetly make you very sweaty! The fact that you wear an HMD while getting physically active obviously makes that even worse. After longer play sessions (30+ min) you might want to take off the HMD because it's getting a bit uncomfortable.The name already says what makes it so special compared to other VR music games.The harder you punch the orbs with the motion controllers, the more points you will get!You can search forany song on youtubeand create your own challenge for it or try to beat challenges that other players have created.The good thing about that is thatyou can make an accurate beat syncronization that really let's you feel your music how you like itwhile other automatic algorithms from games like Audiosurf, Audioshield and many more might fail to capture that feeling.If there is no challenge for a song you need to create your own because Soundboxing has no automatic algorithm.Each challenge has its own high score board. You will get an ingame message when someone beat your highscore. You can add challenges to your favourites and also you can create your own playlists now.While playing you can see a big screen where the music video is playing and you can select between a variety of beautiful background enviroments which creates a great atmosphere!The haptic feedback of the controllers also does a great job and supports the feeling of getting into the beat quite well.Sometimes I had some issues with the ingame pointer and a few crashes but apart from that there's nothing to complain about.Soundboxing is a great workout game with a high replay value and its absolutely worth the price of 7,99€!"

I have high hopes for this game, not only is it a great foundation to build upon but the developer interacts and listens to the community.A side note for fellow germans: Since YouTube is used, a lot of modern music is blocked by GEMA.What I would like to see adjusted:- The ability to restart from a certain point in my recording and stop with the click of a button- A grid like view to see more songs at once- Hide the constantly visible menu with the menu button.- Make the plane you have to hit when recording more visible, since its quite easy to loose track of it"

,Recommended,517130,30450674,Posted: 11 March,all,Avitz,"I've only played a short amount, but due to the nature of the game I'm certain not much is going to change.I like this as a welcome alternative to Audio Shield a game of pretty much the same concept. VR, youtube vids, go nuts. This one allows you a lot more freedom off the bat however, creating custom tracks as opposed to using some formulator to work one it. This has it's pros...And one rather arm aching con.Soundboxing takes it's main game play philosphy in a different sway to shield. It's on the offensive. Rather than just Audio Shield's 'just getting the orb gets you all you need', there's a multiplier tied in to how much welly you put into a hit. Five minutes later and I was a sweaty mess after going all out on a track. Definitely great potential for an exercise game here.Few problems however - If people have suggestions to resolve these feel free to leave a comment and I'll get around to correcting this.- No way to change the youtube stream quality. It streams on a pretty big screen with what I think is 480p. I don't have the greatest internet, so waiting for this to load is a time sink i'd rather not have. Let me crank it down (or up for those with better net) so I can just get to the music and the punching.- This is pretty strenuous in comparison to the aformentioned Audioshield - Make sure to have them wrist-straps on, have a nice big open area to punch towards - It likes to go for low and wide stretches sometimes. And don't bother giving this game a shot unless you have some foam replacements/sweat proof foam guards. This game is a sweat machine.- It's not as pretty as it's rival. This isn't a gripe, just I did like the asetic of Audioshield more.All in all, it's a sound punching game that takes on a more strenous and aggressive approach to similar games. Not the best if you just want to unwind whilst flailing your arms around, but if you want a workout routine oh boy you're in for a treat here."

,Recommended,517130,31068064,Posted: 10 April,all,Scruzzer,"Soundboxing is in the same vein as Audioshield, but it's more about punching than deflecting. It's more beat focused than Audioshield, but at the same time it's more linear. AS sends down hits at various angles while Soundboxing is more structured delivering your hits from straight ahead of you.I like the play of Audioshield more, but Soundboxing has a great main feature that can't be ignored. The routines are all user generated. As a player you have the option to play someone else's routine or create your own challenge with the song of your choosing to share with others or play yourself. This creative layer to the game sets it apart from Audioshield or most other VR games for that matter. Audioshield is predictable, but Soundboxing is playing someone's personal choreography. Note that if the song you want isn't already set up as a challenge, you have to create it to play it. That's really not so bad though.Is one better than the other? No. Think of Audioshield as freestyle interpretive dance where Soundboxing is a planned routine. Fun either way."

Airtone (most expensive, great look and gameplay, limited songs)2.	Holodance (really really great, nearby nr. 1 and by far nr. 2)x   (Soundboxing - can not recommand at this time as it is very buggy, uploading beatmaps does not work and virtual keyboard does not work for Oculus users)3.	Beats Fever4.	AudioshieldAudioshield: it did not feel like a rhythm game at all and it had only a few sound-stages. The gameplay was not in sync with the music as the algorithm does not do that well. Every game with predefined beatmaps is far superior. You Tube integration does not help. Gameplay feels often chaotic and shallow.Soundboxing: Gameplay felt more serious as in Audioshield. It has user made beatmaps and a youtube integration. You can easily create beatmaps to your own favorite songs and share them.  It has 12 different show-stages. -- Can not be recommanded atm as uploading beatmaps does not work and the virtual keyboard does not work for Oculus users --Beats Fever: Good looking environments, 40 songs with predefined beatmaps. Songs are a bit generic, gameplay is okay but does not feel that organic. A bit chaotic at times.Holodance: with Osu! integration, great looking, fun gameplay, definitely one of the best. Through Osu integration nearby infinite gameplay.Airtone: Best rhythm game out there, if you can life with Japanese pop. It has the best rhythm gameplay of all of them: you have to punch/slap the notes, just holding the stick in the direction is not enough; your punches/slaps make a sound when you hit so you hear the rhythm you are beating (not just a short vibration), the presentation is very beautiful, every song has three difficult levels, all in all very fun and addictive. 25 Tracks included."

The game slows down quite often and randomly, which is pretty aggravating to say the least. Being able to create my own beats is something I've always wanted with Audioshield and now I have it! Once the devs fix the bugs and polish it up a bit more, this will be the No. 1 rhythm game for VR."

,Recommended,517130,25895521,"Posted: 6 October, 2016",all,arleas,"For most rhythm/music based games, the worst thing about them is that you depend on an algorhithm to determine the beats.  Some games will painstakingly create beat maps for each song, but then you're limited to the songs they've done.  This one fixes both by giving the beat map creation to the players of the game.One song can have multiple beat maps, so you're able to see various ""interpretations"" of a song, and in some cases, a variety of difficulties.This game is still a bit rough in some places though.  Right now it's plagued by occasional slowdowns while playing and creating song beat maps.Some things I liked:Each song ""challenge"" is tied to a particular video, so you can't have someone play the 12 minute extended disco version while someone else plays the 3 minute radio edit and put them both on the same scoreboard.If you see a video challenge that looks interesting but then comes up disappointing for some reason, make your own!In VR, it records all the movements you make even if you don't punch so you can feel free to be expressive with your ""dance""Things I didn't care for very much:At this time, you can't see your friend's activity without directly putting their name on the website.The game is plagued by slowdowns while creating beat maps. It may or may not still happen during normal play (not sure yet).If your song choice isn't on youtube, you're out of luck (I guess you can try to make an account and upload it yourself?)the ""boxing gloves"" are set at an awkward angle so you have to hold the controllers differently from other games to line it up properlyOverall, this is a great game, and I expect to see much improvement as the developer is still working on it.  If I had to choose between this and AudioShield, I'd pick this game."

It's as hard or as easy as you want it to be.Unlike most VR rhythm games it's not about just moving your arms into the correct position, you actually punch. So while you can just put your hands in the way of the orb you actually get more points for punching. And that is what I like. Infact my favorite songs aren't the super fast ones with a million orbs, it's the mid speed songs that are a challenge, but actually give you a chance to do full punches and box. It's a lot of fun. If you like music rhythm games you'll love this and maybe lose a few pounds too."

Most ideas sound good on paper but end up not working in practice. This is the opposite; it sounds kind of pointless on paper but holy crap it is fun. I picked it up because it had really good reviews and I'm just pretty much sweeping up every VR title at this point. I didn't really expect it to be very fun, but I figured I'd give it a go and return it if I didn't like it.I started the game thinking I'd do a song or two to try and see if I wanted to keep it or return it. I ended up playing for an hour straight and I only quit because my body totally forced me to. I was having such a blast! The targets move around in the zone so you end up basically having to dance/punch to the music. It feels great, and it was a great workout too. I'm trying to get into shape but I hate exercise like everyone else, so games like this are a really cool way to get some cardio in.You can also just search youtube for a song and make your own challenge for other people to do. So if there's a song that you want to do that isn't there, just go make it! I'm leaving this review because I want other people to buy it so that there will be even more songs out there.

It's basically the same thing, right?I'll copypaste a chat conversation with a friend in order to answer this quickly:#Discussions_QuoteBlock_Author1:16 AM - Commandhat: It's Audioshield's duel-shield concept, but with actual maps.1:16 AM - : isnt that what holodance is?1:17 AM - Commandhat: Does holodance do the duel-shield thing?

(I'll update this review when each issue is solved.)Player height is not considered. Maps created by tall players are completely unplayable to players with low ceilings or short players. This is on the dev's feature wishlist, so it may be tackled soon.You type with the SteamVR keyboard, not with a game keyboard. The major issue with this is SteamVR designates the wrong hand to type with a majority of the time, but this is also in issue in many other games. (Audioshield's search, for example)In relation to the first issue, there is nothing preventing you from walking all over your playspace to make your beatmap. Except, Standing Mode players have no playspace, so they can't do that. Not much of an issue because 95% of the beatmaps created have the player standing in one spot, anyway.You can't log into YouTube from inside SoundStage and pick a video from your viewing history or from your channel.You can't hide the freaking announcements button that tells you everyone else is better then you :(However, there are also some must-haves that improve the feel of SoundStage for me:You see the dancing robots in the trailer? If they annoy you, you can disable them. They still show up when watching high score replays.You can alter the beat speed, to see more or less of the playfield and have more or less wanring of impending hits.You can link to specific beatmaps online, and they can be previewed using HTML5 magic, so you can check if a course looks too intense for you before actually playing.SoundStage can detect if you're making wrong-color hits due to tricky color placements instead of just missing or intentionally using the wrong hand, and will keep your combo going as long as you recognize the issue quickly."

This game is unique in that all the beat maps are player generated in game - a great way to increase the quality of beatmaps compared to the autogenerated beatmaps of audioshield. Users can vote on beatmaps so the idea is that the good ones float up to the top. It seems, however, the demographic that is playing this game is primarily interested in anime and videogame songs thus the top of the popular chart seems to be litered with this. It would be nice to have a better option to sort these songs out if you're not interested in them. Additionally, the interface is somewhat buggy, graphics are mediocre and challenge level is overall low. Increasing challenge buy making better use of a roomscale environment would be welcome.

,Recommended,517130,30316289,Posted: 4 March,all,Spooky Noises,"Easily the best rhythm game available on HTC VIVEWhile Thumper is an extremely polished experience, and Audioshield gives you more options for track selection Soundboxing is by far my favorite.The gameplay is intuitive and encourages high energy motions creating an exhilarating experience that's sure to leave you drenched in sweat.The user generated content can be hit or miss, but if you can't find any premade tracks you enjoy, you can always make your own.However, making your own tracks (good ones at least) can be far more challenging than just playing.You can't edit individual notes, so you really have to nail it all in one go and you'll likely be playing the same song 5 times or more to create a track you like without any mistakes.As fun as I think this game is, I get more excited thinking about what it could be with a few additions.Workshop SupportThe ability to customize the notes/background/avatar is a staple feature for most rhythm games and letting the community take the reigns would add a lot of value to the game.Transparency Slider for the ""force field"" during track creationThis isn't 100% necessary, and I know the small lines extending from the fists also tell you where the edge of the strike zone is, but it can be difficult to keep track of it while doing elaborate motions.I think having the option to set it as translucent or even opaque would aid in reducing errors during creation.Options to reposition or duplicate the ""force field""During regular play notes can be struck (within the timed window) in seemingly any direction, but during creation you can only generate notes with a forward motion towards the field.If you could move the field within the parameters or place multiple fields (covering left, right, and vertical motions) it would open the door to much more creative and uncompromised track creation."

76561198041362633,Recommended,517130,31071253,Posted: 10 April,all,flipii,"Oculus Rift.No performance issues at all but I haven't tried recording. I believe I'm on patch 1.13, which came right after a major optimization pass by the developer.  I have an i7 6700k and a 1080 founders with I think the local cable company's fastest ""consumer"" internet ($70 range /month?) for what that's worth.Worth every cent.  In fact, worth 3 times what I paid for it.  I'm already at 30 hours actively played, which means it's already outlasted most of my VR games.  The last non-vr game I played for a long time is Total Warhammer (Warhammer, Total War) and I'm at 151 hours and $100 spent on that game),I'm a little nervous about copyright shutting the game down, I admit.  I just want to go on the record as saying that even if I had to watch youtube adds to play the game (just like when watching music videos on youtube) I would still think this game is worth it.   Although that little Geico Gekko would drive me nuts (Geico has the long not-skippable ads).  I might boycott Geico out of spite after watching 2 hours of gekko commercials.  The point being that if Youtube needs to monitize this, there's room in my wallet and my patience for compromises that gives youtube its due.  Although I have picked up 3 mp3s already after playing this, so at least the music company I have been angry at for years is getting its due (why are soundtracks with music made for the movie more expensive than the movie!?).I have not tried audio shield or the beetle game.  Getting more points for moving faster is a huge draw of Soundboxing for me, as was the need to really MOVE.  Plus I feel soundboxing requires a lot more variety in how you move -- basically if your two hands can move in any combination of ways - Soundboxing supports it as a dance/boxing move series.The user generated content is, of course, hit or miss, but I've found plenty that are really good.  Plus, after getting a sense for what kind of things I find to be really fun/not-fun (there are almost infinite variations possible) I look forward to making my own.  The best ones really give you a sense of over-the-top dancing (if I tried this in real life, people would get hurt).  You can also probably actually box through most of it, but I doubt boxing teaches throwing a right cross down to your left knee . . . just remember it can't measure power, only speed, and there's no bag, so don't hurt your joints by overextending and be aware it will probably give you bad habits by emphasizing speed and ignoring power and follow through).  The haptic feedback is just right to give you a sense of ""popping"" bubbles and allowing me to pull my punch before I would risk overextension based injuries.My only complaint is that I wish the height could be adjusted in game.  [EDIT: As of a new update, it can!] I play with a sloped roof that makes high&wide notes *thunk* and at 5'7'' there are some really high notes I can just barely clip.  (I have short arms).  I've tried telling steam that the floor is 8 inches below where it really is, but that only helps a little, if at all.  I'm not clear on what determines how tall I am relative to the robots. Fortunately, as an oculus user, a new set of controllers is only $99 and HUGE benefit: the ring REALLY protects your hand.)  Also the fireworks are GREAT fun.I should probably throw in that I was a giant fan of rockband (2?) and guitar hero (3?).  So I'm obviously into this type of game.  (oddly, rockband vr doesn't really grab me, I think because I'm not big on improv and the ""feeling"" of playing in front of an audience is not of even slight interest to me, and I like a technical challenge with exact yes/no key presses (even though I am bad at it), so it looks kind of mushy to me.  And it's going to let me go off script, I'd rather something that lets me plug an electric guitar into my computer and actually learn to play. Plus of course the need to order a guitar online is a big meh).Also: I recommend a cover for your VR headset that is better at handling sweat.  I wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes after using it, but I'm sure that's going to destroy the foam and isn't perfect on a porous surface.  My heartrate did hit 114 after one set (my resting is in the 50s), so it's pretty active. Far more so than robo recall at it's most active.  I can definitely see how that guy lost 50 lbs.As for my VR interest, so far only a few games have made it to the 30 hour mark: Elite Dangerous (sooooo close to what I want but I got sick and tired of the police killing me for stupid reasons when I was trying to be super law abiding and helpful, plus travel time needs more automation), Subnautica (I have an innate fear of dark water--being on the shore at night creeps me out, so sometimes the thought of playing causes me stress, but still great as exploration/horror/crafting, but look-to-point is bad), robo recall (although getting old) and minecraft (Minecraft got somewhat old by 30 hours, but I bought minecraft in the beta a decade ago, so it was only the content that got old, I love the freedom of left stick movement with snap turning.  While it was the only game to ever make me feel uncomfortable, switching in and out of flat screen and closing my eyes meant that after an hour or two of practice I could run backwards at an angle while jumping of cliffs without the slightest twinge.  The toggle-flatscreen mode was GENIUS)."

Sound maps are way better for some songs than others, due to user generation.  A simpple 1-5 star or thumbs up / down after finishing a song would be huge.* Better way to navigate songs:  It's hard to find stuff.

It is still some what fun, but I bought this game because there were enough people saying it was better than Holodance. It is not, far from it. I will get bored from this one really quickly, personally.In soundboxing, hitting the orbs coming at you doesn't feel satisfying at all, there's no sound on impact and there's barely haptic feedback. Holodance has both sound and haptics, with option to increase haptic feedback.The environments and the appearance of the gloves on your hands look terrible in Soundbxing. Not so with holodance, way better visuals, with much more environments.Soundboxing you only have circular orbs you punch once, very boring. Holodance has a variety, for example when a note is sustained in music you may get a slider orb in Holodance. A lot more fun and intune with the music in holodance.Soundboxing does have youtube, but you always have to be connected, Holodance you can be offline once you download tunes from OSU. Will admit it's more difficult setting up songs from OSU.My biggest gripe with soundboxing is, if you start a song, you have to finish it, you cannot quit it to start a new song because you hate the current song setup. Second biggest gripe is it really feels like I'm just hitting air which in fact I am. But Holodance makes it feel like I'm hitting something tangible."

This game has quickly become a favorite and I feel it is a great value price wise especially compared to other song based games! Player created beats, a wide variety of songs, and the ability to create your own beatmaps means you will be entertained as long as you can stand and punch the music! We have tried other song based games and this one is our favorite. This game will make you sweat and you will feel it the next day! I found you sweat harder when you create your own beatmap because of the way you have to punch in order to get the beat bubble to show up....i.e. no cheating or your beatmap will look lazy and boring! So if you are looking for a full body sweat, make your own beatmaps!A couple of suggestions:- the first time you use the search feature it works great, every time after that, the box is hidden behind the songs so you can't see what you are typing- if there could be a tutorial on how to create a beatmap, I think that would be very helpful. When I did my first one, at the end I didn't have a single beat bubble. Because it was my first one and the robots were mimicking my punch, I didn't realize anything was wrong...it took me a few tries to figure out that I had to punch through the red and yellow lines at the end of the gloves and to make sure I didn't step out of the circle or even close to the edge it seems. I have also noticed that you really have to recoil and extend your arm fully for the best chance of the ""beat bubble"" showing up. I found I sometimes have a tendency to do more of a wrist flicking motion and none of those ever count.Overall a great game that leaves you feeling like you danced for hours at a club that plays only your favorite music!"

,Recommended,517130,30249367,Posted: 28 February,all,dinosauriac,"Damn good workout and a lot of fun. The fact that all of the beatmaps are hand-generated by users means they're generally much more in keeping with the rhythm of the songs than the auto-generated courses Audioshield creates. Which means when you bring up a good one and get in the groove it almost feels like you're properly dancing or playing the drums!The biggest strength of this game is also its weakness though: this is completely built around YouTube integration. Trawling the video site to find things to play can be a chore and the huge 360p screen they play on in front of you is a bit distracting. If we were able to use sound files on our own disk drive to play, SoundBoxing would handily beat any other game in this genre. Right now there's also the risk of things like video takedowns or other issues with YouTube itself which might end up removing challenges from the game that relied on them.There are some nice touches though, like the little robo buddies that bop in time to the beat. They seem to play back the moves of whoever created the course, giving you essentially the ideal actions to perform and a window into how exhausted some players were at the end of a track. Creating your own beatmaps involves watching a video and hitting against the forcefield in front of you, fairly easy to do, though it can take a while to find your rhythm.All in all, this is a great little game that I think I'll be coming back to a lot and hope continues to grow wth time."

You won't want to be passing around a headset at a party unless sweat soaked foam is your thing. Get an aftermarket one that can be easily sanitized and wiped dry if you want to take turns.2) As of right now, the game is mildly buggy.

,Recommended,517130,33199795,Posted: 3 July,all,Xariann,"I tried Soundboxing, Audioshield and Holodance, so I can make some comparisons. I like Soundboxing for sure, much more than Holodance, although Holodance is more varied. What killed Holodance for me was the Osu integration - I had to mess about with external installations which I didn't think were very intuitive so I wound up giving up.With Soundboxing all the beatmaps are created by the users. This is both a good and a bad thing, as the beatmaps are as good as the users make them, however if you are really dissatisfied you can make your own. I like the light social aspect of it - you have your profile with your songs and you can see who played them and whether people liked them. However bear in mind that if you want people to play your beatmaps you are more likely to get them played if you create them on more known songs. If you are like me though, that is irrelevant, since I like to play my beatmaps because I just like the songs!Due to the fact that the beatmaps are completely custom made, you can't really tailor the difficulty. I found some beatmaps were outright ridiculous, others were challenging but they made sense (no sudden spasm of your hands :p )I found a few frustrations with the beatmap editor, where some of the beats aren't quite in sync because you have to hit a ""wall"" at the right time. However it is easy to miss the wall, which is almost invisible, which means you miss some beats. I found that I tried to overcompensate by standing closer to the wall, which in turn meant that then my hands were hitting it slightly too early. I guess it takes some getting used to. Correcting mistakes is a bit difficult: you can rewind but some of the beats you created will still remain after a couple of seconds from the rewind point, so you have to guess where they stop, and then resume accordingly. It is not that straight forward since you are trying to follow a beat.Movement wise Sounboxing is the most repetitive of the 3 games I tried. There is extra emphasis on how strongly you hit a beat though. You can't ""hold"" a note, they are all hits, and there are only so many combinations you can do. It is still quite a lot of fun and I recommend it. You certainly work up a sweat and it is a great way to excercise."

The user-submitted maps (i.e. all of them) vary immensely in quality. Some seem like they were created by spastic spinning and flailing, others actually match the beat 80% of the time. Best to just put on a personal favorite and record your own punches, then try to match yourself.The editor could be better, though. I would like to see some sort of algorithmic ""guide"" when creating a challenge, similar to other rhythm games' level generation. Would help with staying on beat and remembering changeups when recording.And while I'm making suggestions, it'd be nice to keep the current search text when opening the editor. Often I'll just need to make some slight correction to the dictated search, but trying to edit it manually makes me type the whole query.It's very fun trying to hit the targets hard enough to get that nice explosion.Definitely worth $8 at least."

It's now a lot of stupidly fast and shiz nightcore crap to skim through. I maintain that it is fun but having some filters to ignore certain things (nightcore) would really help.having some beatmaps that are included and verified would be nice too. I still keep my score though{edit 2} OMG I found the tracks I did first and favourited them. I even made my own and one thing that strikes me if I watch the dancing figures on some tracks. People are trying to dance in their own style which is very hard to match to hit the beats. Some though, make their beatmaps with a mind for someone else to follow so the placement is not based on someones unique dancing style but actually on game play and predictable patterns.making a beatmap is quite simple, you just play a track through and dance the beats. it's because it's a one time thing that the problem of someone dancing in their own style compared to laying out beats for others to be able to match. the nightcore jap stuff is a perfect example of someone trying to lay down a complex dance studio or arcade dance set of moves but with no editing ability to make sure it matches the beat turns it into a farcical request for others to repeat. I'm not even sure the people that make the beatmaps can even repeat their own performance!still loving it though. it's the first time I've got a sweaty mask liner since I got the vive{edit 3}Please make it so I can ignore a username. It seems some people are just making huge amounts of beatmaps to poor songs, poorly executed in some misunderstood way of getting seen.I need a way to list only songs with beatmaps.I'd like a set of non-amateur created beatmaps to play with rather than hit and miss with choosing tracks that are poorly danced or so extreme that the person who made it can't even get past a 20% scoreClicking on a name in VR should NOT open a browser on the pc. If I'm streaming, I can't see that the browser opened and my viewers can't see the action.Add ratings so you can tell everyone that a beatmap is not worth it to help with the natural selection process of discovering good beatmaps.Some hints for beatmap creators would be to use predictable patterns and build up to a fast section so it is more of a duplicatable experience for players. Also, not everyone has a full 5x5 room to play in so stepping to the side twice is not the best move.but score still stands! it's massively fun."

I already have Audioshield so I wasn't sure I wanted another seemingly similar rythme game. But I'm glad I gave this a chance. It's different enough from Audioshield to set itself apart and I honestly I think I may like it even more. The beatmaps are really fun to play through and really responsive. Being able to create your own beatmaps is great too, it make the game feel more connected to the people playing and there is a community built up around it. Plus it's great to be able to make a beat map and hand the headset off to friend to say ""OK, beat that.""The only downside is that making the beatmaps takes a bit of getting used to. There is a fairly hard to see forcefield in front of you while you make the beatmap and in order for a punch to register as a new note you need to hit this forcefield, punch short and nothing will register, punch through on the prior note but fail to draw back through the forcefield so you can hit it again and the next note won't register. Each punch must impact the forcefield to register (this only applies to making beatmaps, not playing beatmaps). It's not too bad, but it does take some getting used to."

,Recommended,517130,31020529,Posted: 8 April,all,4o7.dc | Gpig,"I have 68 VR games in my library. This is my favorite. Audioshield was my favorite, and I still like the graphics and the cool feel of the vibration as the orbs seem to splash around your hand.  I used to turn Audioshield on for a song or two and immediately feel pretty good. Audioshield is a good pick-me-up.But if you can only buy one rhythm game I would get this. Soundboxing is the ultimate pick-me-up. It's much more energetic and feels like you're moshing to the music on some songs, on others it feels like you're doing the finger snaps (this is definitely true on the excellent ""Happy"" remix). I was sore this morning from the hour I played when I first got it, and so I said I would only play one song and take it easy. Less than a minute in, that had gone out the window because I was having too much fun.This game would easily be worth $20, but it doesn't look as cool in the screenshots/videos as Audioshield so it would be a tough sell without word of mouth. You can turn the robots off if you want. Don't. I thought I would hate them but I think they're actually recorded by the beat creator and so they're excellent.Buy it. It's cheap. There's a Steam refund policy. There's no downside but a potentially huge upside in trying it out.Edited to add: Punch the notes to get more points/get a good workout. Just let the notes hit your hands to take it relatively easy. Try both and see which you prefer."

Some of the user created content is pretty intense.  This is a game that will only get better with the more users purchasing and creating.  As of now it's a solid game in my VR library.

Only downside is that tracks have to be made and not auto generated so if you like obscure stuff your going to miss out. Most popular songs are weeb nightcore style stuff but even if ur not into that stuff like me the gameplay is so good espiscally if u wana sweat!

,Recommended,517130,34482286,Posted: 25 August,all,ChunkyStyles,This game is very fun to play.  It will also cause you to work up quite a sweat.Don't buy this game if:- You don't like sweating while playing.- You like obscure music and would be annoyed that your preferred songs don't have beat maps and don't want to make them yourself because they may never get played by others.Do buy this game if:- You want a good rhythm game in VR.- You want to get a workout in VR AND have fun while doing it.The UI isn't great.  Searching for songs is cumbersome.  Some people who create beat maps aren't very good at it.But all of that doesn't matter too much because this game is a blast to play.

,Recommended,517130,34722635,Posted: 3 September,all,Spook2Spooky,"This is by far my favorite VR title now. There's a wide variety of beatmaps already created or if you're feeling spunky you can create your own.Huge exercise potential when you get better and can 100% most songs and focus on maxing the strength meter each hit. It's competitive with the notification system telling you someone beat your score.I wish the featured section would still update regularly, and I have had some issues with scores not saving, but outside of that, no real problems with the game.It would be awesome if the devs pushed more.  I think achievements could be added easily and would help with people losing motivation to play.Highly recommended if you're looking for a game to get a good workout and some competitive fun! I won't touch audioshield now - I tried once and went straight back to Soundboxing."
,Recommended,517130,34601108,Posted: 30 August,all,Sir Casm,"I bought an Oculus for this.Update: Alright, having tried out all the main rhythm games on VR (Audioshield, Holodance and Soundboxing) - I can safely say that this is by far the best among them.Audioshield can generate from any track, but the downside of that is - it often feels random and not synced.Holodance is pretty cool, OSU integration equals access to tons of beatmaps, but it was too fast paced and often glitched out for me.Soundboxing so far has been perfect. Lots of user generated content and some amazingly sick rhythms in there - and the beats just feel right for most of the beatmaps I played. Highly recommended!"
,Recommended,517130,34914232,Posted: 12 September,all,LathiiSa,"Despite the few flaws it has, I'm really enjoying this game. In its current form, it feels very raw, but it works. Right now it currently beats the competition out of the water (I couldnt even get audioshield to load) as to whats currently available. I was looking for a replacement of exercise to replace my mudane workout of swimming a few times a week and this fits the bill.. combine it with washable face masks and you're good to go. With that in mind, there are a few things that are missing that could make it an incredibly better experience. I truly wish the developers would 1) Open up Workshop availability for users so that the player base can change robots, the balls, environments, & maybe modifiers a la DDR (EXCELLENT!, sound hits.. etc) 2) Make the custom beat tracker less chaotic  3) Fx the rift controller in the keyboard mode inside the game and lastly 4) Have automatic generated tracks that haven't been made by users yet. If you can get over these hurdles all in all it's a good VR game for it's time and at $8 you really can't beat it. Pun maybe intended."

I hardly ever get a crash now and this has dramatically improved the experience for the game. There's also a fairly broad library of songs these days, although if you really want a track for a song you're still going to have to make it yourself. I've been using this game as my main means of exercise and it's done wonders for my upper body.Old Review:Good concept, tracking on the controllers works pretty well. The game crashes quite a bit though, which ruins the experience. Also, if you accidentally click the pause button (which will likely happen given your grip) you lose your note streak when you resume. Would much prefer an auto-generated mode (like audioshield) as most of the songs I want to play haven't been created and I don't want to put in the work to create something."

Unlike some other VR rythm games, the stages are not procedural, but user created, and as such the songs are a lot more fun and better synchronized than any other game could be.Overwhelmingly fun and an excellent work out.

,Recommended,517130,35485654,Posted: 4 October,all,UnicornHarrison,"While there are no shortage of VR Rhythm games on the market, Soundboxing has the simple, yet engrossing gameplay down and it truly feels like a workout. Never has punching virtual balls feel so rewarding. There are no gimmicks or over-stiumlated backgrounds. The robots mimicking the challenge maker's moves are an incredibly nice touch. More importantly, it's fun.It's such a shame that the rest of the experience feels like it should be early access. The UI is difficult to navigate at times, search is fairly useless, and the game has a tendency to lock up. I can forgive these things because of the low price point, but the real unforgivable sin is the real lack of dev communication and community curation. Games like this live or die on it's community and Soundboxing seems to be on the verge of dying. The challenge creation tools are extremely limited and difficult to make. Challenges with videos that have been pulled down are still up. What challenges are new are never pushed to the featured section as that section is never updated.Considering a lack of updates (last update was in June 2017 as of writing), it seems progress will be slow. I really love Soundboxing and I am proud to recommend it for it's gameplay. Just don't expect an active community.+ Simplistic yet Rewarding Gameplay+ Great Workout Tool- UI needs work- Lack of Developer Updates- Community Curated challenges are hit/miss"
