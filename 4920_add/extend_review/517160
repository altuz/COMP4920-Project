I was feeling a little gutsy so I grabbed the longest, narrowest plank in my garage. I walked it a few times IRL -  no problem. But when I fired up Richie's Plank Experience... oh boy.Que a solid ten minutes of me with one foot in the elevator and one on the plank whispering to myself ""it's not real, it's not real."" When I got brave enough to step halfway out, I panicked. I hit the home button in a cheap attempt to escape - but to my horror, the menu was transparent, and I could still see myself standing on the plank. There was no way out of this. I closed the menu and had to shimmy back into the elevator, my heart beating out of my chest. Trembling, defeated, I hit the elevator button and did a little skywriting first, to get myself used to the idea of flying (and falling).The firefighting is definitely the best part of this game. I had a blast and felt like a superhero zooming around the city. I can't wait to see this expanded and to have more goals (and ways to lose).And yes, I finally did make it across that plank - but when I got a little too confident and tried to execute a graceful turn, I plummeted to my death.

Might cure someone with acrophobia...or just frighten them away from VR for good (in a good way)Definitely recommend, for added immersion, setting up a *plank*, although even w/o I'd imagine still a fun experience (particularly as the plank is only part of the fun)Gameplay/Replayability:Enjoyed walking the plank (had a plank setup, elevated) - going near top of 1st for my ""1st time in VR"" demosBEYOND the plank - spent even more time doing the rocket-based fire fighting & really got a kick out of this (hence my comment that even w/o plank setup there's more to do & enjoy)Seriously this might be the best ""flying super hero"" core mechanics we've yet to be able to experience in VR! (plank walking aside!)General:I've been quite impressed, following this just for a while now, with devs communications in forums & discussions about roadmap/status/etc. With EA games, this is important for me, as I've voted-with-dollars before on EA titles that didn't have much communication from devs/community involvement/engagement & those were the ones who seemed to drift away immediately. Much more confident with the communication & engagement we've got a lasting commitment to the full release, as well as something that's already well worth the time & money.Price:For just barely more than ""a high end coffee"" out, where I live, this is a bargain as is. I've frequently spent more-for-less on other VR titles. And the uniqueness of this type of VR experience, perhaps more-so for those who setup a ""plank"" of sorts (imagine create ways besides lumber this can be done - heck, lrg carboard box folded over few times might just do it).For anyone interested in a unique VR experience, that can also incorporate a ""real world prop"" for added realmism, and/or enjoys a fun ""flying game"" mechanic - I'd recommend the purchase.Looking forward to following this as it develops.TL;DR - bargain price, very unique experience (both plank & flight gameplay), more polished than many EA VR titles, active dev who engages community.

First is the Plank walk, where you go to the top of a skyscraper via elevator ,Then walk onto the plank, jump off and die, ect. Basic but fun!Second is the Sky Writer mode, one hand holds a paint shooting rocket, the other allows you to pick different colors. You fly around and sky write. Also basic, but fun! I made some neat stuff with it.The main reason I was waiting for this, was the flying mode. You are given two rockets (The right hand can switch a rocket for a fire hose that you use to put out fires around the city.)Fast Iron Man style flying was so much fun, I put out a few fires, then played chicken with cars, flew up the sides of buildings, ect.I love what I played so far, and can't wait to see whats added to it! Fingers crossed for some spiderman style swinging, cars that I can pick up and throw around, and some super villain fights.....assuming it ever goes that route.It was worth the money to me."

At times this game had my heart racing or just laughing hysterically. It's just great.It doesn't seem like there's much game here but looks are deceiving. Basically, you take an elevator up to different floors. The main attraction is a high floor that opens to a plank hanging out into the air. Walking it feels so frightening. If you go the extra mile and actually use a real plank to walk on, the immersion will have your heart racing and in cold sweats. And if you fall off the plank? Let's just say I'm going to rule out jumping from a building as a form of suicide if I ever become despondent.There are other floors that you can mess around with. A really fun one has you putting out fires...with a jet. This mode lets you fly around the city using a rocket jet in one hand and a fire hose in the other. Crazy, right? But it works! You can fly anywhere you want and it just feels so cool! You can land on tall buildings, look down, fly away, land on a car, fly straight up, and let yourself fall to your death. It. Never. Gets. Old.Until you start feeling sick. I'm still a little dizzy writing this review. It's not terrible, but this game is best enjoyed in short bursts."

Not much replay value but the joy of watching friends crap their pants is PRICELESS! You MUST use a wooden board for a prop. Adds to realism X1000. 2 other modes besides plank were not done all that well but have HUGE potential. Mode objectives were just bypassed and I flew around the city like superman!! It was amazing!!

Dont buy this for the plank nonsense, you'll be done with that in a few minutes. Sky writing is ok, but this really shines in the fireman game. The controls are simply wonderful.  I've never felt like a super hero quite as much as I did flying around putting out fires on buildings, on moving cars, in the park, etc...  There are bugs and the game is a bit short and gets repetitive, but they are really on to something and I hope it gets fleshed out into something even more incredible.  This was money well spent.

The flying fireman in particular is great - easily able to chase the chopper, annoy birds and zoom through the park a metre off the ground.- the graphics are good (SS 1.5 on a 1080). Not photorealistic but compared to a comparatively priced window washing sim - MUCH better.- the audio effects are well done with traffic and other noise (i've yet to make a plank and put a fan in the room).- that movement mechanic when flying is great, i can see it being used in other games. No nausea, no plummeting to the ground if you take your finger off the trigger.Cons- there's a gap in the lift door.- can't surf around the city on the roof of buses."

Which is actually precisely like Black Mirror season 3 VR episode with its own giant spider, but here it's like PS1 graphics and still scary as hell!Perhaps a bit overpriced at $8, but still, very replayable compared to other titles. The plank walk and fall experience is a great thing to show new users and the firefighter mode (while glitchy currently) is surprisingly fun. The painting mode is kinda tough since you can't see what you made until you turn around, so you have to be pretty good at visualizing things."

Yeah, putting out fires is fun and so is sky writing, but let me save people like superman/the rocketeer. :)Also, why no double art jets in sky writing?

I have no fear of heights but it took me thirty seconds to build up the courage to step off the plank.  Great for a quick demo for first timers.  I am going to get a 2x6 next time I make someone do it.  Having carpet takes away from the experience.Don't buy this if you are expecting something with a lot of replayability that you can sink 20 hours into.  If you have company over often, it is worth the couple bucks.  It is worth it even more if you have a friend who is afraid of heights...EDIT 08/30/2017Cycled through 25+ co workers through the plank. Some wouldn't leave the elevator and immediately closed the doors and hit ground floor, some got out half way and had to baby step in reverse back to safety, some danced on the plan without fear before stepping off, and one jumped off when she came face to face with a big spider near the elevator door.Continues to be one of my ""go to"" titles for newbies once I get them used to VR in more relaxed titles."

For those customers overseas who suffer bad exchange rates, this title ends up costing a fair bit and doesn't offer enough. For a start you need a reasonbly big play area. For a small room VR setup it was impossible to even get to some of the buttons.

Partly because it costs about the same price as a pint of beer and a packet of crisps and partly because it's unexpectedly fun.It is another one man band VR experiment riddled with bugs and rough edges that appear to be left on because the dev obviously thought ""What the hell, I'm just messing around. It's not like anyone is going to play this that much beyond the plank part are they?""So how the heck does it end up being so much fun? Forget the plank game for a start, ignore that, that's for your fat aunt who does not like heights and is trying VR for the first time. We seen that already.Anyway, why is it worth even trying? Well, it has a level that lets you fly round an extremely horrible N64 looking version of a city with two rockets attached to your hands like Tony Stark. That's it. I mean the music just cuts off at one point as it is clearly broken or just gives up and it fades to silence. The jet trail from one rocket is bugged so the smoke trail cuts off...You should be quitting....What, you are still playing? What are you doing? There isn't even a backdrop beyond the city, just a friggin untextured polygon nothingness, why are you still here? What are you doing?Oh you know, just flying through the sky, zoooming up to cars and pulling away at the last second. Flying straight up the side of a building and landing on top. Flying in between narrow gaps and Radio masts. Squealing with pleasure. Like in a childhood dream.Looking at this from the point of a hardened somewhat jaded gamer I would say this game totally sucks, it looks God awful and has way way too many bugs, but due to the power of VR, some lovely coding for the jet conrtols, throw on ""Back in Black"" in the background it is crazy fun for at least 20 minutes (opps played over 1 hr).One day there is going to be a superhero game that will be truly great, this clearly is not it (unless they refocus on the flying hero level alone), but as soon as you try that level you will know the flying mechanics are going to work. So what you get here is a chance to experience a glimpse of the future, a suggestion of another, better game. That's why it's worth the asking price, besides us Vive owners are choking on bundles of cash anyway right?Pfft..they said we would all get sick if we moved in VR, well I have just been flying and I feel just super."

You'll get about 3-5 minutes of enjoyment out of it and likely never come back. It works as a cool VR demo, but if you're seasoned in VR it probably won't blow you away unless you're really prone to motion sickness. In the game you can do only three things.-Put out a tiny fire with a hose.-Fly around and draw with your exhaust.-Walk the plank.Perhaps if I had an actual 2""x4"" on my floor it might be more worth the experience, but honestly it was pretty bland. The fact you can actually fall from the plank is pretty neat, though.The game itself doesn't feel like it was well made either. The buttons on the elevator can be pushed through the elevator wall or even outward. Almost everything enviroment-based is just flat planes or cubes with textures.Compared to free VR games that I've spent hours in like Rec Room or Accounting, I can't justify this game being $8."

As the sleigh moves around, you pick up presents and throw as many as you can into the chimneys before the reindeer move off to the next stop.I can't recommend this title highly enough. It's a wonderful introduction to V.R. for friends and something fun to show off when you have visitors."

But the fire deck in itself is a good reason to buy this. makes you feel like a super hero. My only compaint is how un realistic the city looks. The flying would be alot more fun if it didnt look so fake. 7/10"

Whenever I demo the Vive to my friends, this is the game I have them play first. The immersion is incredible. When I first walked the plank, it took me over 5 min to get the courage to jump off. I wanted to jump off, but my mind was telling me not to do it!The city is beautiful and the graphics are great.Everyone has a blast being santa throwing presents and flying around the city."

,Recommended,517160,30147918,Posted: 24 February,all,Skeleton,Awesome experience! I get a little laggy or slow at the start but thats it. At first I thought this game was only a plank but you get 2 other game modes that are so cool. You get a jet pack and you fly around the city and you can paint with it. Then you fly with a hose and kill fires. Super fun.

The plank thing on the top floor is alright and perfect to demonstrate VR for first timers, but the real fun is at the fire deck, where you can fly around the city like Superman. I was worried about nausea the first time I tried this, but to my surprise (and delight) I had absolutely no issues with simulation sickness in this game."

I'd gladly pay much more just to watch the cowerinng, frozen legs, and general screaming as my friends try to convince themseves it's not real.  Truly immersive and love it.   More content would be great, but this is a must to showcase what VR is truly like to friends."

I find it fascinating that even though I know it is a VR simulation,  my brain fights me furiously against walking out on that plank. And using this app my son recorded what might be the funniest YouTube video of my wife trying the app, except that she has forbidden us to uplaod it. (but it was hilarious!)"
