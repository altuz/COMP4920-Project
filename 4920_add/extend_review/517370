,Recommended,517370,30428373,Posted: 10 March,all,Faudraline,"People go to church for the same reasons they go to a tavern: to stupefy themselves, to forget their misery, to imagine themselves, for a few minutes anyway, free and happy. - Mikhail BakuninTavernieris the debut game coming from the French indie developer studio, From the Bard, presenting a tavern management simulation in a fantasy setting. For me it is a brilliant idea, since we rarely take a look on the NPC side of any fantasy story. I've been playing RPG games for years now, both on computer and tabletop. In nearly all those games that I've been to, all player characters voice a dream one time or the other: dealing with the main quest and being able to retire to safety one day to open an inn or a tavern. It's the optimal retirement plan for any medieval adventurer, ask anyone! Now, you can actually do it, yet again another adventure is included for you nonetheless.Your uncle was a Tavernier before you, and now your time to take the establishment over has come. As he retires, he shows you the basics and leaves for you to handle the management of the tavern in the town. As you start, you'll have guests coming from many different social groups: folks, guards, rogues and wanderer to start with. They all prefer something else on the menu, a different kind of music for the local bard to play, some other treatment coming from the Tavernier, etc. It will be your job to attend them and pick one to favor above others to get a reputation and a social standing for your own self. As you go by though, a mysterious visit from the town mayor occurs. He comes in, picks one of your patrons and no one ever sees that man again... This unsettling occurrence repeats every month and townsfolk are reluctant to talk about it. Only if you manage to earn the trust and acceptance of one group, you may delve into this eerie mystery and uncover the scheme which threatens to destroy the whole town! Enjoy your retirement!Now that we're done with establishing the base setting, let's hit our other subjects. For the display, nothing is marvelous or spectacular, but all artwork are fitting for the setting as hand drawn characters and environment. I enjoyed different kind of customers and their various outlook in game. There is no voice acting whatsoever, but you are free to choose your background music - folk, metal, jazz, classical, you name it! - fitting for the social group you are trying to impress. All musical numbers are free sample legends, playing on the same piece until you change it.As for the game mechanics, it all is quite simple: easy to learn, yet hard to master. According to the kind of customers you favor, your complete number of customers for the week and the random encounter you face, your whole income is regularly calculated. You have to deduct your taxes from that though. With your earnings, you are free to garnish your tavern furthermore, to attract more customers. Random events occurring at the end of each week will depend whether you have the right decoration, have appropriate amount of money, whether you are considered a professional or just a cool guy too. Each new group you favor will unlock different random events for you to enjoy, and their outcomes will affect you furthermore.Each month, an event relevant to the main story will occur, and if you've managed to fulfill its criteria, you'll progress in the main story. If not, you'll try next month. In 52 weeks, your game will come to an end, whether you've managed to solve the plot and face the main villain or not. So, I foresee various trial and error periods before you manage to complete the game with the good ending. Once you get a hold of how the main scenario works, you won't have that much of a trouble though. Then, achievement hunting begins - which is the real challenge. There are 4 main social groups and 4 more that you can unlock in your progression (you have to pick 2 for a single playthrough) according to your choices. They all will present you different abilities like tipping, attracting customers, being able to use magic etc. So, this simple little indie game presents a surprising amount of replay value for you.Well, at the end of the day,Tavernieris obviously not the best thing since sliced bread, but it is a successful indie management game with a good story in store for its value. I do recommend the game for your discovery. Good day, and good gaming to you all!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

I finished the storyline in 30 minutes, however I am a very fast reader and I did not pimp my Tavern out as much as I could have, because I didn't realise that more categories unlock as time goes past. There is a storyline to follow and I think the hourglass on the counter tells you how long you have to complete the storyline. I haven't tried the management mode yet, but I will soon! It's a good game, you pick sides, pick a type of customer to focus on, buy loads of perks and set up a menu. I'd definately recommend it as a fun little time water with potential replayability due to the RNG events you get constantly."

It's not particularly complicated or deep. Over the course of 52 weeks (52 turns) you must generate gold and increaase your customer base by selectively buying decorations and food. Also, each week you have to make a decision on a random event that has just happened, but this boils down to a choice of two or more text based options. There is an overarching plot but again it's presented in the same way as the weekly events.I think what I'm trying to say is that it's a basic managemnet sim with a VERY light RPG element to it. It's worth the £2, if only barely."

Its price of only £2 makes it hard not to recommend.There isn't much gameplay as its a simple management game with a choose your own story mechanic that doesn't have a lot of depth. This however doesn't take away from the fact that it's fun in a way Cooking Mama or Papa's Pizzeria where simplistic things are executed well and are enjoyable to play. The basic gameplay, as fun as it is, did not make me want to play through the game again. I liked the story but I felt like it wouldn't differ much on a second playtrough, however your experience may vary.The game only costs £2 and I felt like I got my moneys worth for the experience and I recommend you to buy it if you enjoy a fantasy setting and a casual management style game that has a pretty interesting story that you will unravel fairly quickly."

The art style looks nice, and the writing got more than a few chuckles out of me.  There are even nice atmospheric touches like changing the look of the tavern as the game progresses and giving you new music about halfway through (to give you a break from the track you've probably been playing for the past half hour).It took me two playthroughs and a little over an hour and a half to figure out how to get to the end of the story, but there are several factions you can focus on, so I'll probably play through it a few more times just to see more of the dialogues.  If you find you're stuck, use the ""management"" mode instead of story mode.  It'll show the rewards of all possible actions, so you can make better decisions about how to build the stats you need."

This is a game with a lot of glaring issues that pop up constantly.Firstly, there are grammatical errors. A lot of them. And not simple, forgiveable things like a misplaced comma here or there, but great big flashing misspellings and broken paragraphs that launch me right out of the game, not that that's terribly hard because the story is completely nonsensical. Not to spoil it for those who still wish to play it, but the primary antagonist shows up multiple times throughout the story in disguise to actively help you, and this is never explained. You can also apparently become captain of the guard just from having a lot of coppers drink at your establishment.Finally, the choices you get given throughout the experience have bizarre outcomes that don't make a lick of sense, including random radical alignment shifts, which can be devastating for a game that flat out requires you to fo all out with your alignment choices. Being anything but abusive to the guards that show up on occasion apparently makes everyone (including the guards) think you're less ""cool,"" while the only way to regain coolness seems to be to do things that actively hurt your business.It's all rather poorly thought out and irritating, but it also seems to be the very first game from this developer, so this is to be expected. The art is nice, and FromTheBard may go on to make some genuinely good games in the future, but this is not one of them."

It had interesting twists to it I wasn't expecting, and it was fun trying to get enough gold to buy perks. However, it's EXTREMELY short, and about 30 minutes in, you'll start to see the results of the choices you make repeated over and over. You can focus your play on the different faction for some variety, but the results are still the same. If you got this for under a dollar, kudos, but if you have to pay more than that, I wouldn't waste your money if I were you."

It's a fun game although I wish you could make it more difficult. I mean, on my first playthrough I only just beat it on the last day (and I'd just like to mention that I've only played story mode), but I'd been a really cautious player. Overly cautious, as it turns out there isn't really that much nessecary managing to do and your actions don't have too much of an effect on you. All consequences are immediate and small.For exampleA rogue asked me to spike a drink and offered money, I took the money but did not spike the drink. He ended up dead and another rogue threatened me ""We won't forget this"". Nothing of depth ever came of that threat. It was just a loss of population amongst a group already at 0% population in my tavern. Immediate and small.The price completely justifies this though. I just love the potential this game had (has?)."
,Not Recommended,517370,33108629,Posted: 1 July,all,[TechRaptor] Coboney,"Tavernier pitches itself as tavern-management but it is all interactive fiction with all of the gameplay loop based around effecting up to 7 different bards for your customers and your 'professional vs coolness' and growing customers for more money. The game has 52 weeks and in each week you make a decision to an event that is relatively short and mediocrely written with many issues. The ""tavern management"" is setting what meals and decorations but for meals you select food items and decorations its just choosing items to display, not that it is shown in game. All these do is impact those bars or your money or customer count. There's no depth here and while I generally like narrative experiences there's no real payoff or compelling story here."

I expected more from the time management aspect but that was incredibly easy. Only buy it if it's on sale ~ it's not worth it otherwise.I would compare the style of gameplay to Papers Please, which is way more challenging and the storyline more complex.

The game makes it very easy to quickly speed through the dialogs, and the interface is large and easy to navigate. The artwork is attractive. The sound effects and music are minimal, but also well done.I’m considered the Grammar Nazi at work, but I did not find much wrong with the writing in the game. Maybe it was patched after some of the negative reviews mentioned it? A few lines were odd, but nothing so bad as to be confusing, or detrimental to the game.First game, I lost.Sure, I did the tutorial, read all the encounters, made choices...etc. I just didn't understand how to win.Second game, I won on the last turn.Learning from my failure, I figured out a strategy.Third game, I won on turn 40.I'm getting better, but the strategy for each game is much the same once you figure it out.Fourth through twenty something games, I was mostly picking up achievements and seeing if I missed any interesting choices or situations in previous tries.Overall the game is enjoyable. I “finished” it quickly, but continued for several more hours to see more.The only thing I was not a fan of was the victory conditions. You must meet specific requirements to progress in the main story line. These requirements are essentially the same for each game, so once a recipe for success is known, it is similar for subsequent games."

Replay value kinda seems minimal once you've gone and beaten the game one. There's other achievements to be had, but hunting them out seem more like an exercise in tedium than anything else.Not too much in the way of depth, or story. Overall, I probably wouldn't recommend.

I have to confess it was a drunk buy when I came home from the, well, tavern.  And, cconfession #2: its the perfect game to play during that window of time from when you come back from the bar and have like, one or two more drinks before you pass out.Look, I cant be the only person on steam that has come back home from a night of carousing, thought ""I could do with another beer or two"" and then you start going through your steam library looking for something to play.  No, anything involving other people is out b/c screw them. Last thing I need harshing my buzz is having some nerd yelling over my headset while Im tryna play Battlefield.  And Im not looking for anyhthing too complicated; Europa Universalis is out.  I mean that game is hard enough to deal with when Im sober.Enter Tavernier.  Look, youre in the right mindset to run a saloon as youre already half in the bag-and if youre reading this review youre probably the kind of person that has thought ""I would love to run a pub in the Shire.""

You control a tavern at a macro level, choosing decor and food to draw in certain factions, each of which brings different kinds of scenarios you must deal with. Depending on your preference or distain for a given section of the community, different choices may open themselves up leading to a pretty entertaining combination.Pros:+I really enjoy this art style. Almost a comic woodblock, see alsoDarkest Dungeon.+Music is all-around really great and actually acts as a mechanic in itself, with different music choices drawing in different customers.+Low price tag. I got it on sale but the current full price of $2.99 is pretty good for the fun I got out of it.+The overarching narrative is intriguing with fun twists, especially with the first run through or two as you get different endings.+Many of the weekly scenarios will make you think or can just be off the wall and hilarious.+Good, clear, skippable tutorial.+You'll want to give the game multiple run-throughs to see the different scenarios, endings, and achievements.Cons:-The game can be quite short. Once I figured out the game's most efficient pathways and knowing what the various quests were ahead of time meant I could eventually knock out a full run-though in minutes.-Actual tavern management is limited. You have a small-ish selection of tools, furniture, and food to select but the entire experience is on rails so there isn't much space to experiment or go free form.

You are givenproprietorship of a tavern, and you have 52 weeks to figure out what evil is happening in town, and to make necessary adjustments to your tavern in order to put a stop to this evil before the 52 weeks end. You will want to decide what factions you want your tavern to appeal to (folks, guards, rogues, wanderers, mages, etc.) by having your tavern bard play music that appeals to them, changing tavern decorations, changing menu items, and other changes. You will also be given a randomized moral decision every week that will increase and/or decrease certain attributes of your tavern (percentage of your customers that belong to different factions, how much gold you have, whether you choose to have a ""cool"" or ""pro"" tavern alignment, the customer tipping rate, total number of customers, etc.).Depending on the changes you make to your tavern and the weekly decisions you make, this will affect the path you take and the ending, of which there are several pathways and endings. The first time you play, it may take two or three hours to finish, but every playthrough afterwards will take significantly less time because you will see certain recurring weekly decisions pop up every now and then. There is replay value in that there are different ways you can play depending on what weekly choices you make and what factions you appeal to. Unfortunately, while the weekly choices are randomized, there are not a lot of them in each pathway. Once you get to a third or fourth playthrough, you will start to notice a lot of reoccurring weekly decisions, which can feel repetitious and reduce the time of those playthroughs to around half an hour. However, this isn't an issue with me personally; this is because you still get a significant amount of content for the low price because of the variety of paths that you can take and the endings.The artstyle is great, the music sets a good mood, and it controls very well. The negatives I have with Tavernier are minuscule. There are some minor spelling/grammar mistakes throughout the storyline and dialogue interactions with characters. Some of the outcomes from your weekly decisions don't make a lick of sense, and there are glaring plot holes in the storyline. Also, I noticed in a couple of my playthroughs that one or two randomized weekly decisions will pop up every single week in the latter half of the 52 weeks for some reason (possible bug?). Despite these shortcomings, I recommend Tavernier for providing good tavern management entertainment and replay value at a budget price."

However, I finished my playtest wanting the game to be more than it is. I would be giving a neutral rating if this were possible.- The music is great; the art a sort of pencil-sketch style that does a good job. The English wasn't written by a native speaker, however. The grammar is generally okay, but you consistently encounter words that are completely inappropriate. For example, ""the right SPRINKLES are what makes a people come and go"" (referring to extras that improve the tavern; I believe the word they wanted was ""touches""). Other times, the game refers to the ""cave"" when I believe it means ""cellar"".- It makes excessive use of anachronisms (your bard can play rock music, for example) and fourth wall breaking (in one weekly event, I have too much to drink and see my beer floating before me. My choices are to grab it or ""press the space bar"". I chose the latter, andmy bar floated into (outer) space, and I was able to grab the beer, which gave me a bunch of gold and increased my reputation with several of the customer types).- Something about the core game mechanic is unfulfilling; there just isn't enough to do in the tavern management, and no real sense of story in the choose your own adventure part. You have four types of customers (guards, rogues, wanderers, etc) and can change the menu, music and decorations to draw more of one or another; your one ""choose your own adventure"" choice each week inevitably changes your reputation with one or more groups. These A / B choices do not give a sense of story so much as they simply move sliders around. The management part feels similarly unfulfilling; you're given a money dump at the end of each week, which happens as soon as you make your ""choose your own adventure"" choice. The money seems to pour in no matter what, and the net at the end of the week doesn't really feel like it has much to do with my choices so much as like I've been given an allowance by Mom and Dad.The game would probably do better if it were re-tooled into a real-time mode (like the old SIM series) with a more rapid-fire series of events to respond to and the ability to pause. It would probably be better if there were some micro-management to do in real time, and the events occurring more than once per week."

Playing it had several amusing moments, such as during the tutorial where your uncle says ""You're a Tavernier now"" and I could think ""Yes, yes I am"". But that's really a personal level of enjoyment that most won't experience.Gameplay wise, there's not a whole lot there. It felt a bit like a Kongregate game but the promise of a hidden narrative added enough that I'm happy I bought it, given how cheap it is. I've only played through it twice and I'm not in a hurry to play through it again soon, but I'm sure I will somewhere down the line. I really wish I could give a 'meh' rating. The only reason I went with a 'no' was because other players won't get that boost from sharing the name with the game.If I had one note it would be that I wish the decorations and food you ordered for your tavern actually showed up in the game. When you buy all new furniture in order to attract more customers, and the game screen shows that you're still using the same wooden benches and tables, it is a little disappointing."

If the game had a little deeper game-play, a more open ended structure and a slightly more personal touch with the customers (the game treats them merely as a statistic), it might actually be interesting and worth playing AND paying for. As it is, I can recommend this game only to those with a more professional interest in the concept."
,Recommended,517370,25233948,"Posted: 29 August, 2016",all,Sharethepain,"Absolutely worth it for the price, even though people say that the playthrough is too short, that is not necessarily true, it all depends upon the player to explore the actual tavern and various upgrades that you can buy, as well as interactions that have multiple consequences depending on your choice. Some won´t even show if you dont go along with certain factions. That said there is a lot of hidden content that will become apparent only after multiple playthroughs when you choose a different faction or a way to approach the game.+ The graphics are really nice.+ There is so many interactions with multiple choices that even after few hours i still haven´t seen all of them.+ Some of the events are really funny+ The game has great atmosphere+ Great music that evolves (changes each time you progress main story) along the game.- Could use a bit more time to manage the tavern before the actual ending, but iam writing this because i seriously can´t think of any downside to this game for such a price.If even all of this hasn´t convinced you that this game is worth it for such an insignificant price then this game also offers trading cards with neat badges and a handful of steam achievements. It will give you hours of fun for a little bit of cash.9/10, a real steal for this price tag."

Also, the post-end gameplay isn't very rich - I guess it's intended, but I have the feeling you only get access to a small number of events which repeat themselves.The gameplay itself is quite immersive, and the tutorial allows you to get the knack of it quickly enough, even though the first run might be difficult because of events you don't expect and storyline prerequisites you don't understand / aren't prepared to reach. The concept of the tavern management, with a storyline to follow is quite innovative, and I found it to be a great experience."

Also, this is a game of little surprises, so if you want to get the most for your money, don't watch any ""Let's Play"" videos on Youtube.  That said, I'd probably pay the game's asking price just for the soundtrack alone.  The music is very well done, and the producer should go on to offer one's services to produce for other products.  I say this especially for the mid to late game songs in the advanced factions, but that's to be expected as a reward.  Better music is for better playing."

I enjoy the type of  atmosphere in real life. However I grew bored roughly 10 minutes into the game. Done differently with a longer story line and more mysterious things. Along with some end game content to strive for, this would definitely be a better game. However due to the utter lack of content I can't see the game remaining even halfway entertaining after an hour into it.Heres to hoping the refund works."
