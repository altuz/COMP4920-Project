It's lacking players a bit now, but once I got in a few games I was totally hooked. It's simplistic, the controls are intuitive, but It is without a doubt the best multiplayer game out right now for the Vive."

,Recommended,517670,26523826,"Posted: 10 November, 2016",all,Shubert,"Cowbots & Aliens is a multiplayer saloon brawler set in an old-western town filled with Robots and Aliens. It's an absolute blast and does a lot of things beautifully that other VR games fail miserably at.If you like the Paintball mode in Rec Room, but are left wanting a lot more, this game is for you.First of all, the physics in this game are absolutely fantastic. Most VR games suck when it comes to object collisions, but C&A nails it. Every object reacts realistically, and there are tons of objects to interact with. You can flip over tables for cover, grab chairs and use them as a shield until they break apart, then use one of the broken off chair legs as a weapon, or just chuck shot glasses and broken bottles. Of course there's guns too, but the improvised weapons are a lot more fun. You can open every door and move anything on a hinge, even bash someone's head in with the flip-up counter. It's all totally intuitive. There's lots of fun objects, like a piano, horshoes, and a card table, and you can use almost anything as a weapon. You can stack objects on top of each other realistically as well, and even pick up big objects by using both hands. It's a lot of fun just to play around with the physics and see what's possible.The multiplayer is brilliantly implemented and the different game modes are all really fun as well. There's FFA, Team Deathmatch, ""No Guns"" and ""Gold rush"" which has two teams fighting over a bunch of gold bars. The ""lobby"" is a little western town with a tiny saloon and often has more people brawling than the actual game modes themselves, it's a great place to hang out and chat with people, or break a bottle over somebody's head and start a fight.The art style I think speaks pretty well for itself, but like many VR games, it looks a lot better than screen shots give it credit. Personally, I love the cartoony old-west/sci-fi mashup style, and all the little details on all the Robots and Aliens like smoking pipes and taped-on mustaches are really funny.This game can only get better as more people start playing and Devs continue to update and add more.Thanks Devs for such a fun VR game, can't wait to see more content in the future!"

The game is beautiful.  I realized that the moment it was booting up and I saw a giant crisp intro graphic.Pros:- BEAUTIFUL- No bugs or crashes so far- Several wearpons scattered around to play with in the town square- INTERACT WITH ALL THE THINGS- Shank someone with a broken bottle- Several game modes keep things interestingCons:- Not enough people own this game.- Needs more maps- No one playing right now (not the developer's fault of course)I just played my first match with someone last night.  I ran out of weapons and we started throwing shot glasses at each other.  It ended with him charging me with an empty mug and me picking up a chair and killing him by smashing him over the head with it.This game is seriously impressive and the many options for weapons, including enviromental objects, puts this currently in a league of it's own for fun online combat.OVERALL:If this game looks like you'd enjoy it, you'll probably enjoy it.  Definitely worth a buy while on sale!"

Most of which was derived just from screwing around in and around the bar. The game modes are fun though and the shooting feels really good. Melee weapons are a bit hard to throw and don't grab by the hilt unless you pick it up the right way. The graphics are charming and fit the game very well, and if you have friends to play with it provides for an entertaining sandbox to screw around in.You can check out my experience playing this game with friends here:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=801644343"

Jumping into a room, flipping a table and ducking behind it for cover, picking up a bottle and smashing it on the bar, leaning around a wall to peek into a room; it all works very intuitively.

I played with three guys earlier today, just messing around in the town and trying out the four game modes (FFA, TDM, ""Gold Rush"" and No Guns). All four were really enjoyable. As soon as this gets more concurrent players, it'll be awesome!It's a teleport-based shooter, but it's fast-paced nonetheless. And killing people by whacking a chair over their head is one of the most satisfying things I've done in VR.My only gripes are the lack of a manual reload system (to dev: perhaps hold trigger for 2 secs to reload?) and that the ""Personal space"" bubble allows you to see where your enemies are even when they're out of line of sight.

It's hilarious.I'm really looking forward for a roadmap to see where all this is going (I'd really like to reach the upper levels of the saloon, and to be able to choose your avatar), but at this moment its fully worthes the price, and already feels very polished (I haven't met any bug, and the physic glitch were rare).."

It would be nice if you could see how many were playing in each region when you go to change regions.  There are a lot of very cool but hidden aspects to this.  You can carry guns on your belt and quickly swap them with the guns in your hand by using the grip buttons.  This saves on reloading time.  You can force  a quick reload by putting the guns on the belt for a second.  I love leaving the guns on the belt and quick-drawing on people.
