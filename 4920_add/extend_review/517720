,Recommended,517720,35167168,Posted: 23 September,all,Guts,"So I've put in a few hours and have really enjoyed the parts of the game that are out. The only things I would like to see is more availibility to game features that we shouldn't be without. Upgrading parts of the tavern is a huge part of leveling it up and we don't have that yet? Seems like a fundamental feature.Outside of that the game, which is at its bare bones clearly, is still really fun and a great time killer. Theres a bunch of witty stories and the game is rich with pop culture references. Even though not everything that should be available with an early access is missing, you can still see the full potential and the future this game is going to have. Right now 7/10 but when everything is available and they start adding the new stuff I can't see, then this game is easily going to be a 9 or a perfect 10."

It makes you feel like a Guild Master from those mangas with RPG elements that assign or gives out quests. Reminds of a mobile game called ""Dungeon Village"" which has similar elements.One suggestion i would like to throw out there for the devs is that characters should be allowed to form their own parties, and as the tavern owner, assigning quests to parties rather than individuals. The more quests they take should also factor in their teamwork ability.WARNING*** this game is still under development so be prepared for crashes and bugs. Would not recommend buying Early Access for $25."

Clearly very early alpha here and not yet worth anything close to the asking price of $25 for most players. But if you are looking for something different from  most other games, and you have money to spare, this might interest you. It has a fantastic sense of humor at every turn.Very little control over your quest once you send your party out on a mission, so choose your team wisely before they engage a series of RNG text-based encounters. If they come back, you can upgrade your tavern. And if they don't, you'll probably die smiling.If this game does not receive frequent updates, I will change to thumbs down, but for now, I'm having fun with it and expecting good things. Most people should probably wait to buy.TLDR: Charming, very funny, and very very old school with potential. Totally worth $5 now, and very soon maybe $12 if they update."
,Recommended,517720,34989521,Posted: 15 September,all,DrumAce,"I have been watching this game for awhile and have been itching to get my hands on it.  I love management games and I love RPGS!So Far from what I have played I like what I am seeing.  That's not to say the game doesn't have issues as I did run into the save bug. I also  really think this game needs a good tutorial as there are quite a few systems to try and grasp and the managment pages certainly can look and feel overwhelming.I have done early access before on a few other games, some I have bought way to early, others I have gotten were pretty close to complete.  I would say this falls in the middle.  You can certainly play and get some enjoyment from it, but you can also see that there is so much more that is to come.I will say the game comes in on the high side as far as price goes for an early access this far from completion.  I don't regret the money I spent though as the Devs are very active in the forums and are already addressing bugs.  I can see myself spending many hours in this game once it is complete. Who am I kidding I'll probably have put alot of hours in it well before then!"

Saves are working and my party is growing.  The game at its current state is fun with lots of humor and challenges as you progress further.   A+"
76561197985976891,Recommended,517720,34923811,Posted: 13 September,all,Nucky,"Not much too it yet, But there is alot of potential. You can see they have plans for quite a few tavern upgrades, different equipment for your adventurers etc. There are also alot of different characters or visitors, they could also do alot with the story of each one there (or get a bigger randomzier pool). Dident do much of the story though it starts you off (after the introduction quest) with a good old rat killing quest. So d&d storys of any kind can easly be thrown in here.Fun, easy, cute, chill game. Would maby wait abit to buy because of the price.Peace."
76561198426881006,Recommended,517720,35169379,Posted: 23 September,all,handlnbiz,The game is really different and it makes bar hopping fun and adventurous.    It's a different take on the bar scene where you meet people to go on combat missions and get wasted too.    The game is set back in the day with old school weapons and fun and crazy missions and characters.   The game is kind of like an updated Dungeons & Dragons that you play on your pc.   I like how the game makers are listening to us when we tell them we want new stuff in the game.
,Recommended,517720,35174752,Posted: 24 September,all,lonewolfgame,"This is a fun game, still a work in progress, but it is fun!  Basically it is managing a tavern and hiring adventurers that frequent the tavern to go on quests to earn gold to keep it running.  Don't expect a game where you are doing all the fighting yourself, it is more or less managing the band of adventurers and the tavern's day to day business.  The real meat of the game comes in the form of the game's witty writing, the stories that are sewn together through the adventurers and the quests are fun to read and give life to the game's palette of colorful characters.  It's fairly easy to get hooked on the game, as you build up your tavern and go on quests, you want to see what the next unlock item is, and what characters fit in each mission.  It needs a bit more polish in terms of explaining the importance of the traits per quest, so you can better prepare a party to go adventuring, but that is nitpicking.  For an early access game it has a surprising amount of polish, and although there are a lot of elements that show it's a WIP (especially in the GUI) it doesn't really impede the gameplay, rather it gives you insight in to what the developers are going to integrate in.  You cannot use a controller with the game, so make sure you have your keyboard and mouse handy, even if it did though I think it would be pretty clunky to navigate the UI as it is with a gamepad.  Go forth and adventure!  This is a fun title to pick up and play!"

But the stuff is missing right now, so... I've gotten a few hours of gameplay out of it and will wait until more content is added to put in more."

It feels like I am at an old medieval tavern, watching Lord of the Rings and going on a hike at the same time.Being a team leader/entrepreneur and having several companies, this was great. It made me think of how building teams is a skill not only in this game, but in real life. You have to A) hire the best people B) make sure you have them with the right equipment and C) make sure you take care of them when they come back all jacked up from their mission. In many ways, this game reflects my real life experience as a business owner and professional YouTuber.Hats off to the people who made this game. I'm sure you gotta be tough to do this. I hope they stay strong and keep putting more into this one, looks like they will.I started from the bottom, playing games like thisAtari, Super Nintendo, and GenesisNow I drive a $100,000 BenzI make my endsAnd this game is super intenseKeep it realReal I sayI'm being sincereIt's fun for the family and me all yearBOMBA"

76561198368562787,Recommended,517720,35170300,Posted: 23 September,all,smanny455,"In this game, you can choose all sorts of different and unique characters and go out on different missions. Then, after they are done with their missions, they come back and hang out at the bar. You can level up your characters and give them equipment and stuff, which is cool. I think I even saw one of the barbarians get drunk and pass out. The story has unexpected twists and turns when you are on a mission, but everything starts and ends at the bar. Unique idea.Gotta try this game, it is really weird and different and I like where it is going. It is not what I expected and it is already fun, I bet it gets even more fun as time goes on and they keep building it."

It reminds me of D&D and a little of that Football manager game. The art is fantastic and the sound design is spot on for its kind genre/setting and im really looking forward to the future of this game as in its current state its pretty bloody good. P.S. please keep in mind this is early access and I have found bugs to the point of where I had to reset the game, not a lot of them but it has happened. The developers seem like they are constantly working on it and updating it regularly so the bugs dont last long."
76561198011086062,Recommended,517720,34976942,Posted: 15 September,all,Calis,"I really dislike the idea of spending 22 € on a broken alpha. At least features like saving and loading should work properly. That is the absolut minimum requirement for even an early alpha. If I could, I would want my money back. I dont mind contributing to the game through my feedback and bug reports, but this is asking a bit much. Another month or two would probably have helped the game immensly.Right now the game is a crash feast where you have to restart every couple of hours with 0 ingame progress. The problem I see, is that the bugs that will come to light for mid to endgame phases will just prolong the development process unnecessrily, since they cannot be found until saving and loading is possible.My recommendation:Wait with the purchase until the development of the game is close to finish.Edit:The patch fixed the save/load problem. Therefore the biggest issue has been fixed.The concept of the game is fun. Changed my recommendation."
,Recommended,517720,35276435,Posted: 28 September,all,The Dark Tyger,"First thing first:This game is early access. It is NOT a finished product. There are bugs, placeholders, crashes, and missing content. It's a work in progress. If you're not willing to take the ride through the development process ironing out these issues, don't buy early access.That out of the way, it's an enjoyable game. Unlike a certain other early access game with a similar quest system, there's actually some depth to the questing side of this. And it's being added to all the time. No, it's not super deep, but it's got a lot going for it.The tavern management side is similarly not overly deep, but it is enough that, combined with the questing, it makes for an engaging game. Rival taverns and more building upgrades will only make it better as they're added in.Is it worth $25 now? That's debatable, but I, for one, am glad to support such a lovely dev team's endeavors. Will it be worth $25 upon completion? If they keep going the way they are, it'll be a steal at that price."

76561197997899034,Recommended,517720,35481735,Posted: 4 October,all,Sandsifter,"Good game, and I see lots of potential. That potential of course will rely on the feedback that comes from folks who pay the $24.99 for early access. I honestly think that if the devs dropped it to $19.99, more folks would be willing to try it out; hence more feedback.I actually tried to refund it at first, saw that I had played for 2.2 hours, and then thought to myself that maybe I had enjoyed it more than I realized. The lack of tutorial about anything but the very basics does make starting out a bit frustrating though; equipping items, levelling, some bugs (it's hard to tell whether they are really bugs, or if you just haven't figured out how to do something yet) were not especially clear, and I've played these types of games quite often.But, I eventually figured most stuff out through trial and error. My Tavern is famous. I have 8 adventurers (level 3-4) begging for more quests, and I still have enough gold to satisfy the rest of the Adventurer wannabees until I have another slot open in my expidition.I think it's worth a try at this price. I've enjoyed it for 10 hours so far, and I usually evaluate an early access game based on price/hours enjoyed. If it drops in price, or goes on sale, I'd definitely recommend grabbing it. If the Devs continue supporting it, it could turn out to be one of the hidden gems in your collection.Sandsifter"
,Not Recommended,517720,35053854,Posted: 18 September,all,Darklokey,"In the current state of the game, I do not believe it is a ""recommended buy"" at this time at the $24.99 price point.  I've encountered many game breaking bugs that require either exiting and reloading (about 12 - 15 times) and two games in a row that were corrupted during a mission, requiring a full re-start.The gameplay is very limited and is basically a game built around chance rolls.  The food and beverage component needs to be fleshed out a lot more, and is currently just a waste of time to add some content to the game.  In fact, most of the tavern feels very incomplete, and rewards such as the infirmary seem to just disappear without reason or don't work at all.The quests are very limited as well and require little input, except for the user to just keep reading and clicking.  It gets so boring after a short while that you just skip the dialogue and hope for successful rolls, ignoring the rest.A large amount of items are marked as ""coming soon"", which is bothersome after paying a pretty decent sum of money for it.  I'd say it is worth about $9.99 in its current condition.  Will keep checking back to see if it has improved, it has the bones and makings of a really good game and concept."

Nice GUI, good audio and ambience, just not my type of game.Note, because this is an Early Access game I don't want to be too negative. There are a lot of good things going for this game, I am sure someone who is more into the RPG / Adventure aspect of the game will enjoy it, as for me, I am not into this game type. I do not like being forced into playing a way I don't want to play. The management of this game has its potential, but as it sits now, it feels too much on rails.I bought this game based from its tags, Simulation, Management, Strategy, and Indie. It is more RPG / Adventure the way it forces you to play the RPG aspect."

You don't play, you just read.Heroes can have different primary stats (combat, survival, social, mind...) depending on their class.The mission has a primary stat requirement which will be put to test against your party heroes total stat. A roll (1 to 100%) is done and your heroes then use this % of their stat, you add all your heroes result, if it's bigger than the mission stat : success.They get bonuses or maluses depending on their buffs/debuffs which are random during the adventure mission.During the adventure there are other random events (mini quests/missions) that play the same way.You get gold in each mission and mini event and have a sum at the end. You can get a % for your tavern and the rest for your heroes. The gold they get is in fact experience which get them a level up and points to put in their stats. Sometimes a piece of equipment too.You have to make them spend money in your tavern for gold to buy more food and drinks.

There's really no ""building of any kind really, you just select an ""upgrade"" from a menu. And select heros from a menu. And select a quest from a menu. Menu, menu, menu.I got the feeling that the outcome of certain events during quests had some impact on the ending, and then future quests, and that failure/success could be be nudged once you had a selection of heros to choose from, but the interaction is so hands off that I couldn't really bring myself to care.  It's just random dice rolls, with so little control over the outcome that it didn't really feel worth trying.All-in-all, a neat idea that was tagically executed.
