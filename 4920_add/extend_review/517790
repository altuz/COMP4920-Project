76561198032804619,Recommended,517790,30480754,Posted: 12 March,all,kebzero,"Caesar 3 is the first of a quartet of city builders made my Impressions Studios, the successors being Pharaoh, Zeus and Emperor. The four are set to the Roman Empire, the many Egyptian kingdoms, the Greek city states and the long history of China respectively, each depicting the prosperity - and decline - of dynasties and cities.In many ways, Caesar 3 was the 'prototype' that the other three were built upon, and as you play the latter titles, this shows. The backdrop and intermixing of history is a bit shallow in Caesar 3 compared to the latter titles, and though this game pioneered the 'walker' system of distributing goods and services, it lacks the basic tools of controlling said distribution that its sequels wisely got. While you can substitute the basic roadblock with a massive gatehouse building and thus somewhat control where your citizens patrol, you'll very much miss the better controls of markets, warehouses and granaries that's been present from Pharaoh onward. The only way to micromanage this is by sheer distance; markets won't fetch goods that are some sixty tiles away - good to know when you want to deny your plebs wine or fine dining.You might also find it a bit odd that Romans speak in cockney accent (click on your citizens, they'll tell you) - but that's also somewhat charming. Indeed, consulting your citizens on how the city is faring is a favorite passtime of mine when playing Caesar 3.I have many fond memories of Caesar 3, and it's a good game - but its successors give a far better experience as they introduce the tools you need to properly control the flow of goods and services. I highly recommend buying them bundled when possible; as they share the basic architecture you pretty much learn them all by learning any one of them. Fortunately, Steam seems to have a big Sierra bundle that contains the first three games (and expansions). Emperor is not available on Steam as of this review, but can be bought over at GoodOldGames.Building a better Rome is great fun - as long as you can keep the pesky barbarians at bay. There's always that one little village out by the sea that refuses to submit to Roman rule, after all.I've been playing the game on Windows 10 and I've had no issues save two annoyances; occasionally the music track will stutter and begin to loop endlessly (which can be solved by getting the proper dll files from IndirectSound), and the fact that the in-game video clips do NOT adjust audio according to the game's volume setting. If you play with greatly lowered game volume for whatever reason, the videos might bust your ear drums.I'd heartily recommend any of Impressions' classic city builders - just keep in mind that they refined the product as they advanced the series. That said, there's something very special about building a Roman settlement, with all the fineries of the burgeoning empire. Caesar 3 definitely brings this to the table, and is well worth the pittance it now costs."

There are many ways to make your gaming experience for this title better, I highly recomment watching youtube videos on how to start and maintain a well oiled ""village""? or whatever you feel this would be called.Also remember this is an older game with an older engine that runs it. So you need to have alittle bit more patience with your learning curve just as I did. There are alot of little rules when building the game, which in its simplicity is also its great achievement.The game I would give if it was here to give would be 4 or 5 rating.

There's a lot to be said for the fun and nostalgia value wrapped up in the game. I didn't own it in the 90's so picked it up on Steam as I always wanted to give it a go. If you're not sure about whether you should pick it up then perhaps have a look at some of the old Caesar 3 forum comments to get a feel of what sort of experience you're likely to have. The game has some real design issues. Services need to be provided by walkers who apparently randomly traverse the streets and intersections in your cities, meaning that it could be a toss-up as to whether they would actually reach their intended destination to provide the service needed in your city. The workaround for this apparently is to create a long winding snake of a street with no intersections, which is pretty artificial and makes the playing the game a bit contrived. However there are also real glitches in the game. In playing it I noted that changes to remuneration and tax had a negligible effect on gameplay, and reordering priorities for worker assignment (food gathering vs working in the entertainment industry) appeared not to work at all, with many otherwise fine farms remaining unstaffed while the interface indicates that all needed farmworkers are on the job. This can make it fairly frustrating to play, even for a seasoned old school strategy player like myself. Bear in mind that this game is also available form GOG for about the same price but I am not sure whether their version runs any better. Enjoy the nostalgia, but if you haven't played it before lower your expectations. There are vastly better city builder strategy games like Tropico 3 for the same price but offering much better enjoyment."

You'll get along as long as you persevere (and with the internet on your finger tips).Buy it."

Fell in love instantly and played forever until my old HP laptop died on me and the games wouldn't play on my new computers because they were too old. Heartbreaking.FINALLY found it on Steam and freaked out and bought it.Been playing for roughly 30 minutes and have had to restart the game now three times because of music loop. It's silly, but I like the damn background music while I watch my citizens revolt. Is that so much to ask? I have attempted to use the ""IndirectSound"" patch recommended below, but to no avail. Can't get into the .exe game file to install it and really don't want to return it.HALP."

The simulation engine is excellent, graphics aren't too wonky, and the gameplay is both challenging and fun. There's some weird issues with the sound sometimes and I am still hoping Steam adds acheivements, but overall it's worth playing."

Had this game before it came out on Steam with hundreds of hours in playtime.The hours I have put into it on Steam are just from the days between Christmas and NY. It's awesome.If you like this type of games, you will not regret your purchase."

Before Rollercoaster Tycoon this was there. Can it be matched at any point in time when it first came out in 1999? Nope, however if you are a modern guy with a completly different operating system, maybe follow a guide or discussion to make it work. The original developers are probably long gone or off doing other things after the many things that could have happend in 18 years. But I digress, this is what I found for fixing it in Windows 10:After doing some research in finding a solution to launching Caesar 3 correctly without a problem, it becomes apparent that it is always possible with a little tinkering. Look into the ""Compatibilty?"" discussion in Caesar 3 and you can find a solution. For me It was replaceing some files, making sure antivirus didnt delete the HD c3, checking some boxes with dxwnd.exe, and then launching with permssions the c3.exe or the HD one.Perfect Nostalgia profits.ps. always read readme's of 3rd party stuff to make sure it works as inteded and anything is possible."

It's difficulty curve allows for both beginner and veteran citybuilder sim enthusiasts to enjoy the game. Despite this it is still a thoroughly complex and challenging game. It appeases both the general and the city planner in all of us through it's 'peaceful/aggressive' design of level selection. This same design also allows for a degree of replayability in a game. Although even without that aspect, the game is so entertaining and provides so much choice in how to design and manage your city that it would still manage to keep me immersed for far longer than most citybuilders. A feature which I believe is often underrepresented by game critics is that of music, and in this area, as well as any other, Caesar III excels. The music doesn't distract, keeping a largely ambient feel; yet it is sufficiently 'epic' to give to the experience of being a general/governor and eventually Emperor. I feel that Caesar III can unquestionably be called the Citybuilder upon which all future Citybuilers should be measured. The game is a city building classics. Even after so many years it offers finely tuned gameplay, cute graphics, memorable soundtrack... I install it every few years when I look for some modern city building game but find none this good."
,Recommended,517790,33492767,Posted: 12 July,all,drone110266,A really fun game from back in the day. The one that got me into city builders actually. It does it painfully hard to play pretty fast though and some of the mechanics are a bit broken.

,Recommended,517790,35024423,Posted: 17 September,all,Clauwie,Remember this game from when I was younger. The gameplay still holds up to today standards. To bad there isn't a HD remake. Really enjoyable game if you don't mind the limit graphic options.
