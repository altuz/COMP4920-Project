Like that damned market lady that would choose to not deliver to a certain section bumping everyone down to lvl1 -- much better now that different citizens pull from the markets as goods are available.  Also much less guess work with things like religious routes - they've taken the guesswork out of it.  Brilliant stuff.I'll admit, this iteration of the game as available through steam does leave something to be desired.  There's a .BAT file in the game's folder you need to run as admin to get it to go.  Why oh why they not include this as part of the setup script.  Anyway, saw a negative overall rating and figured I'd throw my hat in... the game itself is wonderful.  Well worth the price - heck, it was $60 when it came out and I'd probably pay that again.  <$20 is a steal."

It improves on everything, runs great, is sufficiently difficult and dynamic enough to allow replayability, and comes with scenario editors (though I haven't used it yet, I'm still having fun with the base game).  Your city looks and feels much more alive with the much greater number of citizens, prefects, workers, etc. walking around and doing their thing.  If you want you can even find out which house they live in and where they work.At this price, it is a complete steal."

While I understand why they don't like it, IMO Caesar 4 has its own charm that Caesar 3 does not.I don't even remember how many hours I have spend in each games. Must be more than 100 hours. Back in the days, there are not a lot of game available to play and it's difficult to get new games, not like now. And over the years i've been re-install the game in countless of time and redo the campaign.If you love city builder game, especially roman or mediaval age, this game worth the try.=========+ Simplified worker/citizen housing, divide them into 3 categories and have their own housing, so you don't have to worry about house merging like in previous Caesar game.+ Market Place, now citizen will pick things up from the market, previously market has worker that do house patrol and sometime their pathing can be frustrating and some houses didn't get their supply fast enough. Caesar 4 also divide the market building into each category depending on the luxury level, you can also control the access (who can/can't buy).+ Campaign, lots of missions to clear and have 2 different route for each stage (economy & military). Roughly if you are new to the game, I would say you are going to need at least 30-40 hours to complete all the missions (perhaps more)+ Free/Sandbox mode, it also got this freeplay mode and even scenario editor (a bit difficult to use though, not a very good editor)+ The city feel alive, I should say that the city do feel alive. Citizen interaction and your action felt meaningful, not like in most modern city builder game where they are just pure number. Though I have to say CivCity Rome got better mechanic regarding this issue, but Caesar also felt good.+ Better Graphic, than most older city builder game (well, because this is one of the newest).----------- Military & Combat, are as bad as ever in city builder game (lol)- Old game, this is an old game therefore there don't have the most user friendly UI like modern game. The option are lacking, control can be difficult, tools can be frustrating when you first learn them. But you will used to it after a while.- No Caesar V:<"

And I've recently decided it's not the games themselves: it's the subjective experience of playing, or having played them.CAESAR IV succeeds in a profound way that CAESAR III, ZEUS and its expansions did, and PHAROAH or EMPEROR never quite managed for me: it makes my time spent in-game feel consequential. Like I've been building something that had meaning, not just ""wasting time on a video game.""I suspect this is the appeal of the best city-builders (although I never got the same feeling from SIMCITY or CITIES: SKYLINES), that I was engaged in a creative act while playing, and this meant the activity had value, in and of itself. That the skills I honed playing this game were skills that would benefit me in other ways, in life.I'm delighted that CAESAR IV is now available on Steam. I've just started my second or third campaign playthrough, and am enjoying it thoroughly. I'm happy to recommend this less-than-perfect game to anyone looking for an engrossing, humane, challenging real-time resource management sim set in a fascinating era. Enjoy."

It takes this game at max graphics and runs with it into the hills, holding hands and smiling happily at each other.

But that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ since they never actually played it.Ceasar IV is what brought me back to strategy games after I forgot about the SimCity of my youth. I picked it up one day from the store during a christmas special thing, almost ten years ago. Man, I can't tell you how much in love I was with this baby; it just kept beconing me back into it's world and I couldn't say no.You have good control over how the city is built. Simplistic control. You build a row of houses, give them a well to get a drink from, and a couple of fields and a farm to eat from. Doin good, but you should keep the houses away from the fields (during this time period, cow dung was often used to fertilize, so living next to a farm was HORRIBLE) if you want to see your houses upgrade into something that has more people. Then go build the middle-class housing for the blue-collar workers out there that are needed for working the aquaducts and resevoirs, oh and the pump houses.Simple concepts, hours of fun listening to people ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain, or praise you like a god. (just click on the little people)  You even have advisors to berate you, so you can't go wrong!So happy I got it again, my original copy was mishandled by my cats and a rather heavy drawer that broke the CD in two.

However it is lacking a certain....something. Soul, maybe. Combat is bad, the map involves a bit too much finicky building placement (the squares are too small, organising a city layout was actually easier in C3). Some reviews have commented on difficult camera and annoying rocks blocking your placement etc and these comments have some justification, but can be worked around. I've encountered a couple of bugs regarding combat, which is wonky as all hell, and if you doubt me just try to send your men across a bridge while there's barbarians on the other side.Once you know what you're doing you can blast through the game in no time at all - i finished both republic and empire campaigns in 15 hours (played on normal difficulty and max speed). You rarely have much wiggle room however and I often struggled to get my city running - kept running out of favour and was always going into bankruptcy scrambling to build an industry to supply whatever new thing Caesar wanted this time.I return to C4 every couple of years so there is definitely something here, but I'd recommend picking up on a discount.  By the end the game feels very 'samey' as there is no gradual unlocking of resources + things like there were in C3. Perhaps it's because there are only 3 tiers of pleb and equite buildings and no real incentive to improve their quality of life with theatres etc.  A buy, but get it on discount."

I couldn't get it to run, and had to get a refund.  I own it on CD though, and continue to play it occasionally even after all these years.  I encountered a bug during start up that kept the game minimized and frozen.  Tried everything, but finally got a refund.That said, this is a great city builder game, with Caesar breathing down your neck about tributes to Rome, and barbarians always knocking at your gate.  The combat system is pretty clunky, but it gets the job done.  The camara could zoom out about twice as far, but otherwise the rest of it holds up really well.  The resource managment side of it though it really well done, with a lot of different factors affecting your people and the cities health.  The length of the campaign and the replayability are really impressive.There's probably better game out there today, but this is one of the best ones in my opinion.  If it works for you, great.  If not, go get it somewhere else."

Having whizzed through the Campaign I thought I'd give C IV a go... just now was my 4th try with it and I have to confess I've given up. CIII had such a great interface, really easy to understand and absorb all the info you needed at a glance but CIV has it all wrong. The advisor menu is a mess of cruddy text and weird lurchy characters. I appreciate it was 2006, but why bother when the previous game had no need for animated advisors and it looked much better? My gripes aren't all to do with aesthetics. Dragging the mouse along was lurchy and tempremental, turning buildings took forever and it's really picky about where roads have to be for buildings to have road access- I thought I placed the road where the insulaes door was but obviously not. Why do wells need road access anyway... I couldn't get further than the first few houses which is pretty bad I know, but why bother when I could just play CIII again...Pretty disappointed."

Plus a funny comment hereand there from the plebs.a lot of attention to detail went into the individual character animations.another cool aspect, is that you can zoom in very close and really see some finerdetails, which most aerial view games don't usually have.I really only have two issues... one is the advisors... everytime you click a specificadvisor, he says the same line... which is great, unless you have to click on theadvisor thousands of times.the second issue, the campaigns are quite challenging, in some ways... it remindedme exactly of caesar 2, with the simulation dynamics being very touchy.Some of the simulation dynamics, don't always make sense... like sometimes somevillas will be stuck with stunted growth, and then you give the plebs less money, andfor some reason they upgrade and prosper.i kind of liked the secondary statistics page that caesar 2 had, where this one is kind ofbuilt into the Heads Up Display.  It's alright though.The resources really make things a lot more difficult, and so you have to juggle a lot more,on top of managing an army and all the farming, you have to constantly try to appease Romeusually at the cost of your own citizens.i think the extra simulation dynamics make it interesting... but it can be a little confusing attimes, and unless you've played that particular scenario before, it can be a bit frustrating.Overall, i think Caesar IV deserves a positive review.I think as many have stated though, to appreciate it, you have to play for a good deal oftime, before figuring out all the little tricks to make it all work."
