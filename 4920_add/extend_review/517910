This game is a rare gem, and i dont think its for everybody, but its free and can be easily finished in 20-30 minutes, so i reccomend everyone to play, the worse that can happen  is that you wasted 30 minutes of your life, and we all wasted more time than that. Definetly give this game a shot."

Graphically, it's not amazing, but it's child-like charm is endearing. The music isn't the best thing you'll ever hear, but it is nice and adds to the atmosphere of the game.It's only half an hour long and definitely worth that time."

,Not Recommended,517910,29588917,Posted: 30 January,all,Kalamir,Everyone is just here for the achievements but the actual game is pretty bad. If you're interested in philosophy just google Albert Camus and get the original version in cliffnotes form.

The music is quite relaxing and fits well with the theme of the game. I very much enjoyed it and highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to spend a nice, relaxing, however thought stimulating, half hour to an hour of game play. Bravo!"
