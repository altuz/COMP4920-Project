,Recommended,518030,34635941,Posted: 31 August,all,Owsi,"I have a coordination disability (Dyspraxia), it makes using a mouse and keyboard very challenging at times, playing video games is a challenge, especially if I have to be precise with my movements (shooters mostly). But this is really helpful, not only for video games but for general wellbeing with dyspraxia and mouse use. I have struggled for  years with this disability, but this handy application has really improved my coordination after only playing with it for a little while.HIGHLY recommended"
,Recommended,518030,30907812,Posted: 2 April,all,Ridgeway,"This is very nice for an Overwatch player, specifically McCree players. Counter Strike players may have practice maps made by the community, but Overwatch has only the sub par Practice Range. Set the FoV to 71 to mimic Overwatch.The different modes and maps are nice. You can customize the size and speed of the targets, as well as the crosshair to mimic the Overwatch dot, and short crosshairs. I set the dot to .70, and the short crosshair to .3 to mimic Overwatch crosshairs.The game mimics Overwatch's sensitivity pretty accurately. It has modes for shooting at random targets, strafing targets, and doing flick shots. There is a lightning game mode that mimics Zarya's gun, but I found that the target moves too much randomly on the Y-axis to be good practice.This program was instrumental in improving my McCree play at a higher sensitivity than I was using before. I was able to quickly test and experiment with different sensitivities and grips, and the feedback stats you get at the end of a round were very helpful to compare my method's effectiveness.I would like to see features added for customizing the rate of fire of your weapon, shooting projectiles over hitscan, and the amount of shots it takes to destroy a target on the ""Simple"" game mode. More maps and modes would also be welcome.All in all, I highly reccomend this program in its current Alpha state. The price tag is as much as a cup of coffee, and the training is zen-like. I really enjoy training on this program."
,Recommended,518030,32184197,Posted: 4 June,all,ay,"Awesome game. I've been using this kind of thing to help my aim since 2011, (aim400kg/training_aim_csgo) and carried the top headshot percentage on ESEA with the ak-47 for basically all of 2014, so my opinion is pretty reliable. What this is missing, in my opinion, is an angles simulator. If there was a mode added into this where you started with a center target and then one randomly spawned out on a line, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, which you then shot and then went back to the center target to shoot, it would be perfect. That, in my opinion, is where true muscle memory is built from. Keep it up, guys."
,Recommended,518030,26680824,"Posted: 18 November, 2016",all,Xeniera,"I've been using Aim Hero as a method of warming up for Overwatch sessions and getting used to lower sensitivities in a very precise, controlled manner.  I've already noticed a huge increase in my in-game accuracy and consistency.EDITED FOR FEB 6 UPDATE:So as of the February 6th update, all of my feature requests have been granted.  There is now an FOV slider.PSA:  Aim Hero measures vertical FOV, with the default being 60 degrees.  Overwatch measures horizontal FOV, with default being 103 degrees.  There are calculators online where, if you plug in your aspect ratio (assuming 16:9 here) and 103 degrees horizontal FOV, you'll discover that AN FOV OF 71 IS WHAT YOU SHOULD USE TO GET THE SAME FEEL AS OVERWATCHYou can now edit all parameters of the exercises, your distance from the targets, the target size, the speed with which they appear, etc.  I have been working a lot with reflex and fast aiming with the smallest target size, and slow rates of appearance to build precision.For me, I have found the Classic, Reflex, Strafe and Fast Aiming modes to be most helpful, because of how unpredictable they are.  The Simple mode has been okay for making large turns to find targets quickly.  The PentaKill mode feels too easy, but it's probably more applicable to CS:GO than Overwatch.Since using this game to warmup (or just for stress relief when I want to mindlessly shoot some things to rewind), I've gone from ~30% accuracy with McCree with a 3% crit accuracy to 60% general accuracy with 11% crit accuracy.  My scoped accuracy with Widowmaker is also pushing 60% now, whereas before it hovered between 35-40% with a pitiful crit rate.As of now, the one thing I'd really like to see added is some form of high ground training.  Like, a different vantage point for Simple or Pentakill modes would be fantastic.I still highly recommend this game for aim practice, especially for the price.  The devs listen to the community, and seem to be pushing out quality content at a decent pace.OLD:There are only a couple features that I really want that are missing, those being a way to control the FOV, and a sort of training-wheels option for the reflex aiming, where the targets don't disappear until you shoot them. As it is right now even on the easy setting, I feel like I miss enough shots that continuing to practice that course will just solidify bad habits.A method to your results would be nice, too, but from what I read this is already in the works.Overall, for me, it's proven to be a great way to improve precision and reaction time."

,Recommended,518030,32794863,Posted: 25 June,all,Soon to be Dadmanglia,"Only played 20ish minues at the point of writing this review. This seems like solid aim practice, but wanted to note that I  got motion sickness during only a 20 minute session. This is a fairly good sign this game isn't running above 60Hz, I have a 240Hz monitor and set the FOV to 100 and I had the FPS limit set to 1000 and I was getting over 500fps while playing. I may have to try the vsync setting but that just seems odd to get 144Hz+ to work. -edit- VSync resolved this issueEither way if their's a way to do 144Hz+ I would love to know it and if I can get that to work I would 100% recommend this. Atm though I think I might just limit myself to playing only 5 minutes at a time. -edit- After trying Vsync it supports 144Hz+ definitely recommend this especially if you recently switched mice or sensitivity, great way to get used to the new settings quickly. Can easily play for 30minutes without getting motion sick now.Classic training, and the lightning gun training are both pretty damn good (LG works similar to strafe but that isn't an issue for this kinda training), penta training just seems a bit linear imo, strafe just trys to avoid your crosshair but I'm not sure if their's a better way to program it.WishlistScoped Sniper training. Will need a way to emulate the way scope looks for various games though. OW, CS, TF2, hell I'd love to see some Battlefield support as well. CS and TF2 will need adjustable Scoped sensitivity as well due to a large number of players using non-default values.Aim training that includes player movementwould be very difficult to support games individually but having an adjustable movement speed value would be awesome and allow people to select the speed that for example a CSGO player would have while holding an AK, or TF2 scout, etc. also Practice Circle Strafing, left-right stopping and tapping, etc."

,Recommended,518030,32012776,Posted: 27 May,all,Ed Northcott,"Overall, I recommend this game -- though there's still a fair bit of work that could be done to improve it. The various game modes are useful in helping to develop mechanical skills that give an advantage in games like Overwatch, but some of the games themselves still feel 'off' in what they provide. The clearest example is the ""lightning gun"" game, which should be an ideal choice for improving tracking. The problem is that the target is reactionary to the cursor, so rather than learning to train tracking on a randomly moving object, we have one that seems to actively repel itself from wherever the crosshairs happen to be. It loses the feel of genuine tracking (or so it seems).However, for its price it's a fair product, and seems to be doing the job in helping to improve aim in game."

,Recommended,518030,33163961,Posted: 2 July,all,ZalQ,"Great game - extremely recommended.I am an Overwatch player, and I mostly play Aim Hero to practise my flicks and quick precision aiming, for which the game's Reflex mode is the best. I feel like it is helping with my target acquisition time (reflexes), aiming precision, as well as aiming speed. In other words, reflexes feel better and I notice myself having better accuracy over time - consistently. I also like the Lightning mode of the game. It is helpful for tracking, which helps if you play Overwatch and play heroes like Soldier 76, Tracer, or Zarya a lot.The customization options of the game are good enough and you can customize the games nicely enough within whatever mode you decide to give a try. As long as you get your eDPI/FOV settings right over from other games you play - you should have a blast and notice results.Even though the game is in early access, I can't think of much I would like to be added, aside from scope-training mode and further customization options, such as crosshairs or other map types. I am confident these kind of things will be added in the future anyway.Absolutely recommended for Overwatch, CS:GO or other FPS players. Especially for the players of the two aforementioned games, since Aim Hero has a sensitivity converter built in it for those games!"

If anyone asks whether the aim enhancement is working, there is a dramatic rise. It is just like studying to overcome things that are not fun. It looks like there is no royal road. If you have a complaint, practice diversity is too lacking. I had hoped to have a variety of sniper, moving and running, even at double the price."

The author introduces updates regularly. Helps me practice and warm up for slow paced games like PUBG where oppurtunity to practice isnt readily available. Its well worth the 5 bucks that I would otherwise have blown on a large caffe moca or something like that. I would have liked to see a built in mouse sentitivity converter to go from CS to PUBG without alot of guessing. I would have also liked to have the ability to change my point of aim on the fly to simulate myself moving. Use web based calculators likehttps://www.mouse-sensitivity.com/to match your mouse sensitivy across all your favorate games.

Take a break occasionally, you can't marathon this.My only complaints are the limited feedback and lack of diagnostics for individual runs, and it needs more gibs.

While I was told by ioStux that reflex mode is the only one worthwhile, I actually really like the newest mode that trains your tracking aim (great for Zarya in Overwatch). I would love to see a mode that trains for scoped ""charge up"" shots (e.g. TF2 sniper or Widowmaker's rifle in OW). I'd also like to be able to practice on animated character models (for headshots specifically) instead of just target roundels. I think this has a lot of potential and I'm eagerly anticipating new features."

I personally use it to get better in Overwatch, and after more than 20 hours of practice i am starting to see noticable improvements.(I usually play 15-20 minutes 3 times a day, often as warm up.)My weapon accuracy on Soldier:76 went up by 12%, from 33 to 45(on average). I am now also able to secure kills on Tracer that i could not before.However it takes time, you will not aim better over night, a lot of determination and will is required to pull through these regular drills.

,Recommended,518030,34845035,Posted: 9 September,all,☮JeanChoux☮,"Very useful for those out there who often plays FPS games competitively. Aim Hero currently supports Overwatch, Paladins, and CS:GO. I train myself with Aim Hero if I'm bored and before every CS:GO session for about 5 to 30 minutes and my aim has improved significantly. Ace? done that several times in a few past days. Flick Headshots? done that 3 times in a single round on the last session I played.Sure some fellas out there said that the classic and reflex training mode is available on custom maps in CS:GO community workshop. But the thing is Aim Hero also provide other modes that haven't been available on the workshop. While I should admit that classic and reflex training in Aim Hero lacks customizations (also in other modes), but I don't think that would be a dealbreaker for me.Also, the mechanics and hit register is far more smoother than in CS:GO. I don't know if this is a negative thing for Aim Hero or not, since this would mean that Aim Hero doesn't reflect CS:GO's mechanics and hit registers perfectly (lmao).Including CS:GO's weapon (AK, M4, SMGs) recoil characteristics and its recoil training would make Aim Hero the perfect aim training simulator. Including pre-fire training on several popular maps such as Dust II, Inferno, Cache, or Mirage would also be nice."

I play CS:GO alot and the idea of a third party practice ""emulator"", to me, was really attractive. What this game had to offer, albeit verry  little, was to me woth the money. I find myself commanly looking for more diverse and effective aim practice maps in CS, but hardly find any as effective as this game ""in theory"". Unfortunatly, this game ran very poorly for me, wich was suprising. It runs much, much worse than counter strike. In terms of fps, it runs very smoothly, exept whenever you shoot, where large lag-spikes occure. After running this game for about fifteen minutes, my cpu somehow went from ~45 to 78 degrees c, witch is nuts. I am running a dual booted imac (on windows). Imacs are notorious for their lack of ability to keep cool, but, to give some perspective, i can run Fallout 4 ""Witch falls far below (in recomended hardware) than my mac"" for hours without passing ~50 degrees c while overclocked (my mac was not overclocked while running this game). The strain this game put on my computer honestly doesn't make any sence to me, but it is there, and quantifyable using afterburner, and the lag is very real. By any maens, I dont the games price is justifiable despite my troubles running it, however, I do really like the idea. If you are considering buying this game, I would stick to workshop/alterier methods of training until the price is cahnged, or content is added. As far as the technical issues go, I belive I am in the minority, for other comments seem to say the game runs very smoothly for them, and honestly i have no idea why it does not do so for me as well.Will edit of game gets to point where it will not  FRY TF out of my cpu.

Abillity to change the weapons and custom weapons (for example: weapons from popular games like Overwatch and CS:GO)2. More maps and a map editor. With the map editor you'll be able to create maps yourself.3. Bots training mode. Make a mode with fully customized bots.4. Custom mode editor. Please add a custom game editor when you're able to make lots of customization and custom games, and add lots of advanced stuff.5. Please fix  the UI and the controls, It's really annoying. For example: Make that the 'save' button will automatically make you return to the main menu without clicking 'menu'.6. Please add more music tracks and the abillity to change them. I have a few nice tracks, so it'd be nice to add more of them.Overall, CS:GO's training mode is a lot better than this game :/You can customize everything in CS:GO, and here you can barely do so.I don't recommend buying this game until the developer changes the game and updates it.Please listen to community feedback, it'd be nice to come back later to this game and see lots of changes.And one last thing, more updates. Please update the game more frequently.Thanks"

I think it will likely work, it's really simply aim practice, the question is how long do I have to practice with this before I see noticeable improvements in other games.=================Week 0/Control Test: This is week 0, I have only used Aim Hero once today, this is as good as not using this program at all.Battlefield 1 - I REALLY suck at Battlefield 1, I usually die 4-6 times before I finally get a kill, but I hope to improve this.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - I suck at COD, occasionally I pop off one kill, maybe two, but usually I get killed before I even know where I'm being shot from.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive - Right now, I'm a fairly decent player, not amazing, but I certainly can't do competitive, I can pop off 1-2 kills before being killed.Overwatch - Right now I main Pharah, Sombra, Mei, Bastion, Torbjorn, Mercy, Lucio, and Symmetra, the best hitscan hero I can play right now is Sombra, which I have an average accuracy of 20-25%, I'm great at the support role of Sombra (flanking and hacking health packs) but I am not very impressive at aiming with hitscan weapons in general.Quake Live - Currently, I'm being dominated by people who've played this game for way longer than me, I am not surprised, and I don't expect to become skilled enough to be able to play well anytime soon, but if I do manage to get good enough to compete with this playerbase then Sim Hero will be well worth my $5.Rainbow Six Siege - This is actually the first time I'm playing with friendly fire (yeah, I've never actually played with friendly fire enabled in any game yet), I messed up a little at first but now I survive about 40% of enemy encounters.Team Fortress 2 - I primarily can main Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Heavy, Engineer, and Medic, I do best with Pyro though. Regardless, I suck at hitscan weapons, especially sniper, hopefully I'll improve to the point that people won't kick me off for incompetence in casual. Of all games I currently own, TF2 is the one I perform best at, and, as I already perform well on this game and there is only two primarily-hitscan classes in this game, I thinkg TF2 is the game Aim Hero will have the least impact on, but we'll see if I'm right soon enough."

Stats and graphs to be able to track progress over time.  You can do measures of accuracy, score, average time it takes to hit the target, etc. over time.2. More specific difficulty settings - For example, for reflex, I would like to be able to control how long the targets stay up on the board, how big the targets are, and how fast they spawn.3. Reflex training - instead of moving the viewer farther away from the plane used to display the target to simulate smaller targets at different difficulty levels, keep the same distance and make the targets smaller please.  This would help users have more accurate shots when they have to do bigger flick shots.4. Sniper training - I think this has been mentioned before.5. Crazy Aim Training - In Overwatch there are many heroes like McCree and Tracer that require you to do like 90 degree or 180 degree flick shots.  One way this can be done is to spawn a target and then once the target is shot, the next target is spawned at a certain degree that the user chooses.Those are a couple things I could think of off the top of my head but I think that this aim training software has a lot of potential if it includes some of those up above.Thanks!-Thomas"

JUST DO IT!"

After doing maybe three rounds of various modes @3 minutes each I could feel my eyes begin to strain. Turning on Windows 10's ""night light"" greatly reduced the burn in my eyes and allowed me to play longer. I also started doing custom modes, instead of the default, just so that I could reduce the time limit for any given trial.Game is working, just don't mess up your eyes!"

I'm updating to say that after the updates, this prodcut is worth $5 and will slightly improve your wrist aim if nothing else.It obviously isn't as good as just playing your main game, like doing quick play in Overwatch or hitting dm servers in CS:GO, so I suggest playing this game while you're in queue for a match to keep warm during the down time.Do not prioritize this game over actual playtime in your main game. It isn't the same, this game should be used for warm up inbetween matches or before matches.Recommended, but don't expect to become a star just because you own this game. You need to grind out your main game for hundreds of hours to actually improve. This game is good for warmup."

Something to be aware of though, for a while this game hurt the crap out of my eyes and I couldn't figure out why.  I took a hail mary and lowered the fps cap from 1000hz to 300hz and it made a huge difference.  No more eye strain and 2 new PRs."

,Recommended,518030,34128704,Posted: 9 August,all,Grave,new update is really good but I think they ruined the reflex training and would prefer the old version
,Not Recommended,518030,32289299,Posted: 9 June,all,I Tendou Stay Offline :),Edit: Ever Since the update they fked up reflex training and training just been getting worser.
,Recommended,518030,32603332,Posted: 20 June,all,False,Reflex mode works very well. Went from 29%-65% accuracy after a couple times practicing. I've also noticed a major improvement in game.

,Recommended,518030,34586253,Posted: 29 August,all,TheLibrarian-,"I use this primarily as a warm-up before playing Overwatch. I've set my Aim Hero sensitivity and FOV to reflect the settings I use in Overwatch. This can also be done to reflect CS:GO settings. Normally, I'll go through one round of the classic training, strafing training, and finish with reflex training, spending around 10 minutes each day before starting an Overwatch session. This has already yielded significant improvements in my aim.In Overwatch, I primarily play as Lucio, who isn't a very aim-dependent character, but so far, my weapon accuracy for a match is regularly 35%-40%, whereas before I was in the 20%-25% range. I've become significantly better with heroes who depend more on aim, especially flick shots, like McCree. Playing as these heroes, I regularly get gold medals in eliminations, objective kills, and hero damage, and I imagine I'd be good with other flick shot heroes like Hanzo and Widowmaker if I played as them.Aim Hero is still in its early stages, and you can tell that it lacks polish, but it has produced tangible results for me so far. If the developers continue adding polish and features like leaderboards to compare statistics with other users, more training modes, and so on, it could become an essential tool for hardcore FPS gaming."

76561198399440388,Recommended,518030,35502011,Posted: 5 October,all,valentinb219,"If you are motivated to train your aim, this is a great product. If you are not motivated, it will be boring. But fear not, all that is needed is some background music, or a podcast, and you're set. Lower the in game default music to 0, and lower the shot sounds to as low as possible while still giving you feedback on your actions.It does exactly what is advertised, and, in my opinion, with excellence. The modes are challenging, and I don't stray much from the default difficulty settings, even though the customization options are extensive. I see great value in this product, especially as an Overwatch player that hasn't played an online FPS before it. I do recommend it, and have already recommended it to my friends."
