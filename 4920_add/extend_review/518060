76561198162410567,Recommended,518060,32623806,Posted: 21 June,all,Awkward winkyface,"Excellent chess game. Visually stunning, runs decently, VR support, online multiplayer - it has the whole bunch. The menus and GUI are intuitive and decent enough to look at. There are a monicum of customization options, allowing you to change the settings and piecesets and/or their material. It employs the original AI that bested Kasparov and passed the Turing test, so anyone looking for an impossible challenge got to the right place.It does however not come without it's flaws: the control panning for keyboard and mouse users is very poor - disallowing you to rotate the screen to view the environment(which is ironically a main selling point). It employs the conventional ELO system, but in literally every match you play. This means you can increase ELO by playing against incapable friends(pretentiousness ahoy) or against easier AI. There is no casual mode. The PR is unimpressive, which will surely lead to it's playerbase dying out very soon.Overall it's definitely worth the price, but it could use some tweaking."

And this software is awesome guys, good work, keep it up!I love classical music, and I enjoy the music you pick for this game, thx.--I think it's a good idea if you:-add more skins! and more background of course. this software have so many potential, do keep develop this game.-advertise this game to all Chess lovers, this Classic game should and will be famous on steam.-add more music. you know some interesting match could be long.or, allow us to customize the background music we like.--most of all, it's a great game and I would like to recommend this game to everyone. thanks for your effort."
,Recommended,518060,33659777,Posted: 19 July,all,Kincaid7,"Really really great Chess Game, the only ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part I have found was that a lot of your enjoyment is gonna come from playing aganst the bots and your friends (good luck getting them to buy it, it would be nice to have a 4 pack option) as the multiplayer works in a style where you get into a game and the person who started the lobby has MOST LIKELY already exited the game and is doing other things.I wish they would put in a option where you can only get matched with other people who are currently in game or are also searching at the same time as you and put less priority on lobbies that have been up for hours so if you wanna play a continous game you can easily do so.Some of the camera angles are set to be tilted too on some maps and that can get pretty annoying, so if they could implement more personalization with the camera angles that would be cool too.Still worth it though even accounting for those complaints9/10 Best Chess game out there"

,Recommended,518060,34132917,Posted: 9 August,all,devslashzero,"Wow, I have been looking for something like this for years! I've found it because I was bored, so I started exploring recently updated games in the shop. The game is quite new and I hope the developers will continue keeping it up-to-date over the years to come.Actually it has been a long time since I've last played chess. Here is a good opportunity to start again. The graphics is good for the purpose. For me, it's the best graphics I've ever seen for a chess game. You can actually put it on max details and 4k, as framerate doesn't matter. Seriously. Even if you downsample 4k on a 1080p monitor, it still looks amazing.I haven't tested the VR mode yet, but I don't think I'm really interrested. Maybe I'll try it sometime. I find it more relaxing on my big monitor or with Steam Link on my TV anyway. While your opponent is thinking, you can do other things simultaneously. There is a notification function, when it comes to your turn again.The game has a good soundtrack and it isn't annoying. Actually it calms you down, so you can concentrate on the game. You could enjoy it, with a glass of wine after work. ;)There is great potencial to make more people start playing chess again, which is (IMHO) the best turn based strategy game ever invented! Easy to learn, hard to master.When you want to play online, better take some time with you. That's how chess is supposed to be played. It's all about thinking, till your brain gets muscles. :D"

,Recommended,518060,32647665,Posted: 22 June,all,Allomein,"I am an avid chess player, and off the bat I'll say that there are many more sophisticated chess programs out there that permit analysis, use of databases etc.  That isn't what Chess Ultra sets out to be and honestly it is a welcome addition, and at under $15 it is a real bargain. I can strongly recommend this for just enjoying a game of chess. Also, it comes with a lot of mate in X tactical puzzles and historical games to play through.  A beginner or an advanced player would enjoy this.For jumping in and quickly getting an enjoyable game of chess with gorgeous sets I don't think you can do better than Chess Ultra right now.  I have had a fantastic time playing with and without VR against the computer and human opponents.  Playinmg against the Grim Reaper in VR was a lot of fun.Sure, below amatuer level the computer is horrible - but at challenger it starts to really play chess.  The puzzles and historical games are quite good.  You can play the computer at different levels, random human opponents online, or people from your friends list.  They also have a tournament system in place.  You can play untimed, 5 minute blitz, 30 minute with increment, and 45 minute.  I wish they would let us do custom times, or add more options like 10 minute, 15 minute, 3 minute and 1 minute bullet (although the nature of a 3D interface is not conducive to bullet).After a little tinkering with resetting my seated positon, VR works very well and it is a lot of fun to sit accross the board virtually and really feel like you are sitting at a board.  I wish it would complete the sense of immersion in timed games by letting me also hit the clock (it automatically hits the clock) - but I can forgive that.  Speaking of clocks, they have a model of a chronos-like clock but animate the buttons as if they are pressure (click) buttons when they are touch buttons on that clock so would not actually move - but that is a minor detail.As for sets, they are all very good looking.  I wish they would add the option for a cheapo roll-up board to go with the plastic pieces to give a feel of just playing on a tournament set.   They could add that and a ""random coffee shop"" environment :PShort story - a lot of fun and if you have a Vive you will enjoy playing in VR :P"
76561198220599868,Recommended,518060,33743491,Posted: 23 July,all,LXQUICKJUSTICE,"Love it. It can be played with an xbox controller, and if you have the patience for it, facing off against the computer at increasing difficulty will turn you into a chess master. The music is sexy and the environments are stunning. If you ♥♥♥♥ up vs the Hall 9000, which will happen quite often, it lets you back up as many moves as you want; this definitely helps players perfect their craft."
,Recommended,518060,34091343,Posted: 7 August,all,SteelHandedStingray,"This is probably the premier chess game on Steam. Absolutely breathtaking visuals and very relaxing soundtrack to accompany the mood of each level. Could the AI be a tad better? Sure. It's not a deal breaker or for that matter, even anything I would mark Chess Ultra down for.The new update answered almost all the real problems with the game (more control over camera angles being the biggy). I will say however that it is very, very difficult to find an online opponent within a reasonable amount of time. This is a big one for me and a problem I look forward to being fixed soon.Fix this and this will be a 10/10 chess game."
,Recommended,518060,33329733,Posted: 6 July,all,MalloryKnox,"This is probably the best version of chess I've played on PC. I don't have anyone to regularly play with in person so its the next best thing. The challenge mode is great too, and is actually that, 'challenging'.Worth the money, but don't expect it to be more than it is; just a chess game."

,Recommended,518060,32720271,Posted: 24 June,all,MICHAEL PUGNETTI HELLO,"NOTE: I AM PLAYING THE NON VR VERSION OF THIS GAME.Great graphics, amazing soundtrack. Really great production value, the tutorials are definitely helpful with teaching. I don't think it's possible to make a better chess game. I haven't been able to get DSR to work yet, and there seems to be some faulty resolution / scaling shenanigans going on which I'm going to assume will be easily fixable. Overall I'm enjoying this awesome chess experience. I'm also using the steam link to cast to my TV to enjoy the super epic graphics and soundtrack.Multiplayer uses an ELO system which is always good. A few easily fixable issues here and there like people joining a game and being AFK so the game doesnt begin, but most of my matches went on flawlessly5/5Hopefully the few issues I have get resolved. but this is the definitive chess experience."

Purchased game because I thought it included animated AI opponents, but there are none.  Perhaps in a later DLC they plan on releasing them. Tournament play is dead.  No players at all. Cannot offer a draw, computers AI never resigns.  Controls are clumsy.Once the eye candy wears off there is not much here.  For those that really love the game of chess, this game cannot be recommended because it doesn't inlclude even half the features you can find in free chess programs."

76561198003223591,Not Recommended,518060,32943793,Posted: 28 June,all,DarkStarClassic,I like chess so i bought it.But its very limited mainly probably focussed on VR.No draw options if your in end game and computer have only king left and you have lets say queen and few rooks but times up you lose even if he don't have materials to win so no real chess rules here.Responsiness of mouse moving pieces and click squares is terrible you just lose 30-40 secs in one 5min match. Also first move you do no matter what you try you aleady lost few seconds.Computer on any level plays fast forget winning on time not posible.Over all it's ok chess program just for fun thats all.Can be very frustating at times with not all chess rules and using mouse try get pieces move fast and sometimes don't work well ugh..Because it's 13 euros it's no big deal but for real chess and fun go to website thats way better then this.It's better then Pure Chess same developers but because of limitations buy it only if your collector of chess programs:)New to chess or like VR buy it if vetran i would not spent money on this one.Have fun or not!
76561197971972173,Not Recommended,518060,32951153,Posted: 28 June,all,Xeno,"I bought this to use in VR with the Oculus DK2. Yes it works, but the graphics are horrendously blurry and just hurt my eyes too much. The actual level of the opposition is very weak. Also - the tracking for the Oculus doesn't even work, therefore when you for instance, lean forward, you'd expect to be looking over the board. Not so. The entire image jumps all over the place, and no there is nothing wrong with my tracking or headset. Many basic options I'd expect to see in many free chess games are simply not there. I'll forget VR Chess as I realise that there is no point to it - especially if not implemented perfectly. I've got Fritz 14 and a real wooden digiboard to use with it - I'll stick to the real thing and with a decent program. I've requested a refund. This game is worth at best £3 for the novelty. I'd pay that for it - but not £10."
