,Recommended,518580,29430279,Posted: 22 January,all,[JAWA] LibertyBohnz,"If you like Rick and Morty, you'll love this! Definitely one of my most fun VR experiences. Was literally laughing out loud while playing. Short, sweet, funny, and free! Can't beat it."
,Recommended,518580,29866237,Posted: 11 February,all,CYB.tachyon,"When I heard there was an interactive VR experience by the creators and voice actor of Rick and Morty, I thought I knew what to expect.And lo and behold, in all its glory, an impish, impetious, curse-laden delight.I laughed, I giggled, I cavorted, I once even guffawed.Great for everyone except those people who don't like long-winded high-brow expletive-based with-weird-dashes-in-the-middle humor. Those people are wrong, screw 'em."
76561198002049680,Recommended,518580,29542758,Posted: 28 January,all,Dimvision,"A truly funny experience, well worth the 20-30 minutes to download and play. And when I say truly funny, I don't mean the kind of funny where you laugh at things when others are around because they're supposed to be funny. I mean truly funny in that the dialogue was extremely well written and had me laughing to myself stupidly at night after my family had gone to bed.A few parts took me a bit to figure out (especially the court room) but that is mostly a testiment to the writing: I wasn't sure if I was supposed to do anything because the characters kept saying hilarious stuff. Accounting was free and extremely well done, and easily deserves a recommendation."

,Recommended,518580,30216105,Posted: 27 February,all,Ooops,"This is a surreal, at times funny but also deeply disturbing title that takes about 20 minutes to complete. Accounting is truly groundbreaking, making brilliant use of VR to reach an emotional impact impossible in any other medium.But that means It could also be traumatic, so I'd advise quitting if what it asks of you makes you too uncomfortable. Nevertheless, Accouting is a must-have in any adult's VR library."
,Recommended,518580,29814370,Posted: 9 February,all,Defnac,"Wow. This game is hilarious.It just makes you think about VR possibilities in the field of graphic adventures. I know the game is simple and easy, but is just great! I loved the humor, recognized Rick and Morty voice acting immediately and loved the game from beginning to end. Would pay everything for a full game.I just hope graphic adventures come back with VR."

,Recommended,518580,29512129,Posted: 26 January,all,Psythik,"Very short, but very clever. If you're a fan of Rick & Morty or The Stanley Parable, you'll love this game. Some parts may take a while to figure out if you're stupid. Bring over the dumbest friend you have and let him try this game for the lulz.Also, if you like this game but you haven't seen R&M or played Stanley, do yourself a favor and take care of that RIGHT THIS VERY SECOND."

76561198041775277,Not Recommended,518580,30013425,Posted: 18 February,all,PancakeAuditor,"The graphics are well done, and perhaps this is unduly harsh as I played this game immediately after finishing the absolutely amazing Budget Cuts demo, but I found this to be annoying and puerile.  While I thoroughly enjoyed Rick & Morty, the humor here seems to be a 12-year-old's interpretation of Rick & Morty.  The audio and dialog really get in the way of what could be a fun game, but ultimately just annoys and discomforts the player."
,Not Recommended,518580,29911118,Posted: 13 February,all,Quitch,"Big fan of Rick & Morty but this just did nothing for me, Humour didn't land, character's talked for far too long about nothing and often over one another so you can't always hear what they're saying, and there's little to do except figure out the one gimmick in the room that will move you to the next. And when it ended I was glad, and that's never a good sign.The master volume for the game is also too loud compared to other games"

,Recommended,518580,29557492,Posted: 28 January,all,AtomicToast,"It's free. It's short. It's VERY funny. It's simple enough that beginners to the Vive can make it through, and it's unique and polished enough that veterans should also all play this. There's no reason not to download Accounting."

,Recommended,518580,30237211,Posted: 28 February,all,Kitty Rampage,"A VR game by the twistedly hilarious minds behind Rick and Morty. That should be enough reason to play it right there. It's amazing funny and after playing it I can't help but continue chuckling as I remember playing it even days later. It's a short experience, if you allow all of the dialogue to run it's course (which you really should) then you'll finish it in about 30 minutes or so. But it's free, so who cares if it's short. Really the only reason I wish it were longer is because it's *so* good. Really looking forward to seeing more from this team in the future."

76561198006529957,Recommended,518580,30125730,Posted: 23 February,all,CrazyC,Its free and the humor is on point so its a fun little sampler that you can beat in 15-20 minutes. However I should note that a few essential in game objects were just outside of my play space which meant running into things in real life and made some parts of the game a brief pain in the butt. If they fix that everything else is great.
