No strap on or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥could ever have the realism that was necessary and ended up as a practical joke.Thank-you to the developers who accurately give me the gift of understanding."

And truthfully, which of us can claim that we have never been in many of these 'game' situations in real life?  Which of us has not occasionally dressed up as Batman  and run around the office showing the shocking truth that lies behind the cape? Are there any of us who have never dressed as a gorilla and run around the supermarket showing our banana to the checkout girls?   I know I certainly have.This is a roller-coaster of a game.  You'll laugh.  You'll cry.  You'll be tazered. Mark my words:  This game is destined to become a major Hollywood movie.  Or a TV series.  Or both.  A modern classic."

After you've beaten all three levels, there's really nothing to do but try to get a high score. I was expecting more from this game. It's certainly not worth the $5.49 CAD I paid for it.I requested a refund, but since I was outside the 14-day refund period it was denied :("
,Recommended,518670,33326958,Posted: 6 July,all,Dr Megaman,"This is a brilliant game about a lonely man who lives a life where he's constantly bodyshamed by his many female peers, so in an act of retaliation, he bares himself loudly and proudly to as many people as possible, only to get assulted and arrested.  This game showcases an important message that men are beautiful too, but often find themselves shunned, attacked, or even having their lives ruined, for simply presenting themselves as they are to the world.   This game tells that dark tale, and should be played by everyone."

You are a Peeping Tom exposing yourself to the females while trying to stay away from the Security in the game.Intensive ExposureIts quite straight forward,  while there are only 3 levels at this time, and the characters can be unlocked via your point totals.  The music is a fun chiptune to laugh with. and the audio is alright.Overall VerdictIts quick and fun, hopefully they will add on more down the road.Overall Score: X/10'Id say at the curent state its a 6/10, price wise its a good buy,  if they have more levels i'll reconsider my score."

,Recommended,518670,25556281,"Posted: 17 September, 2016",all,Kacper Kwiatkowski,"After seeing it displayed on a game jam, I had to take a closer look at the bigger version. Bigger, but not huge, the trick is in the ingenuity, and the game exposes a lot of it. It's intensive and to the point, quickly showing its best stuff: bare action. Straight, yet getting hard at times. And also really easy on the eyes.It might not catch your attention for hours, but it's nice for a flash of fun in the evening. This game needs more exposure!"

I'm upset there's only three levels, but hopefully more will be done with this considering recently more characters (skins) have been added including Harambe. It's a fun little romp I'd compare to as a cross between Party Hard and Shower With Your Dad Simulator with the most upbeat score.My only complaint at this time is that there is no in-line mode. There's plenty of room for competition beyond leaderboards, and I hope they impliment that in the near future. Until then, flashing the digital dong safely has never been more fun. Mostly because safe flashing isn't fun but you get the idea."

You basically just... expose yourself to a bunch of feminists and they freak out.

,Recommended,518670,25419698,"Posted: 8 September, 2016",all,Sire,"High concept and perfect execution, it's been a long while since we've seen a game this inspired and it's Miyamoto levels of basic, clever and addicting.Welcome to the best Sexual Harassment Simulator out there.You're Moe Lester, and you've recieved a ""disguise"" in the mail which will allow you to hatch your ultimate plan: expose yourself to as many people as you can. You have three stomping grounds, an office, store and museum, the only thing that changes is the layouts and look but the gameplay is all of the same. You try and flash women as long as you can without being caught, everytime a cop touches you that's a slap on the wrist and after 3 you're done. You accumulate a higher score the longer you flash the same women and the higher your multiplier goes. You also get to knock down things to slow the cops and continue your rampage. And that's about it, nothing else to do other than achievement hunt and unlock all of the skins in the game (though they're cosmetic only). The game is quick and you'll probably have multiple goes every session you play. It's great.Sadly the game seems to have some strange issues with the FPS tanking and several crashes to desktop. Other than that I haven't found any bugs.Worth the price, good buy."

You go around 3 different areas flashing people, playing as a man in a trench coat or using any of the many unlockable skins. The game does refer to itself as an arcade game so the fact that it only has 3 zones shouldn't be too surprising. For only $4 this game is a fun little addition to your library."
