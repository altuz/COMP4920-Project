I can't honestly recommend this game for the price. It feels like a f2p mobile game, the guns feel and sound terrible. The game calls itself a cover shooter and yet the enemies fail to use cover and just stand/walk into your bullets. They repeat the same lines with the same voice over and over, they come from the same 2-3 places with the only variation being if they walk or run out into your bullets. If this game was released for anything other than the vive it would get hammered for how cheap it feels, it just isn't worth anywhere near $20, save your money, seriously."

You can definitely tell the difference between one type of barrel and the last, or even the next level of muzzle.Cons:Even though this is a room-scale game, your ability to walk around is limited to your cover available in the area you're in.  Not taking cover means certain death.Becomes somewhat repetitive if you want to unlock the highest levels of armor and weapons with all upgrades.Static spawns and movement for enemies makes it a bit predictable for each level once you memorize them.  The enemies, however do tend to go to various locations and/or shoot from cover, etc.It may not matter to some folks, but these guys were only in Early Access for 5 months and made updates like clockwork based on feedback.  That's how Early Access is supposed to work!I look forward to the next series of levels for this game as well as weapon unlocks, etc.Great game and lots of fun!"

It is great in the sense that it reminds me a ton of Time Crysis and brings me back a bit. The problem is that they are simply charging to much for what is essentially a cell phone game port and they really need to polish it up a bit. Fix some of the glitchiness, make the aiming a bit tighter, put in some higer res textures for the love of god etc. I could see 7.99$ for a title like this. Had to refund it even though it was enjoyable.It has the makings of a really fun experience it's just ashame they priced it as something that's it's not.I'm going to put ""recommend"" as to not screw the game over since it's so early with few reviews, since I like the game, with the understanding that I do *not* recommend it at 20$."

The best way to describe this game is a mix between Virtua Cop and Time Crisis with cover mechanics in play and a version of 'on the rail' gameplay where you come up to each section of the level automatically before the action takes place.The gun upgrade system is good as it gives players an extra sense of progression (extra customisation options would be even better) and the manually selected difficulty during levels is a nice touch. Graphics are good for the type of game and although I've only played through the starting levels there seems to be enough for variety and further gameplay."

It's single player so far and it would be great to see a co-op mode available at some point for added fun.  I've been enjoying it since purchase and I have over 80 VR games.  The fact that I am playing this one today instead of another speaks for itself.Pros:-Decent gun mechanics (a physical firearm/controller would make it more enjoyable)-ability to accessorize weapons-sense of progression-Arcade style light gun battles but with the need for cover-You have to actually move to play thisCons:-Slow reload not based on skill or player speed-It’s easy to accidently eject a magazine by holding the controller too tightly-I want to dye my armor (not really a problem… I just want to)I love Sairento but it’s nice to not have to jump around all the time and worry about pulling my cords out  and I don’t get VR sick from having to use some awkward teleport or run feature.  So for today, this is my shooter of choice.  In short:  It's a fun game and worth picking up, especially if you get it on sale."
,Recommended,518720,28748569,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,SGT America,"This is one of the more fun VR shooters in my opinion.-Shoot from behind cover until all enemies are dead.-Available cover is highlighted.-Choose the next cover that you wish to move to.-Shoot from behind cover until all enemies are dead.Each mission has objectives.  Completing those objectives earn you stars.  Unlocking more difficult missions requires more stars, so objectives must be completed in order to continue.The best part is the weapons customization and the amount available.  I did not expect a VR game to have so many options to be honest.  This game gives me hope for the future of VR.  Overall an excellent game for anyone who likes to shoot and dive around the room occasionally smacking face into wall.  Be sure to set up a ""safe zone"".My only two complaints are related to the controls.  Unless I am missing something it is not possible to remap the keys.  I feel that the mag release should be a button pressed by your right thumb.  It is hard to mow down bad guys when the slightest squeeze of your hand drops the mag, but that is not the worst part.  Two handed shooting does not require a button to be pressed, so when I go to reload I will occasionally end up grabbing the weapon with my left hand.  This causes the weapon in game to snap to the hand and is more of a visual eyesore than anything else, but occasionally (like while in the prone) it throws off my aim.  One button should grab it and that same button should release it.  Just my opinion."

Don't be mistaken, the game isn't actually ""On rails"" as you are stationary until the enemies are cleared and are you able to move to the next bit of cover, but there is an element of progression as you move to new environments in the level.PROS:- A set of pretty assets that helps differentiate from the swath of unity-asset store content we've seen in Vive games, porting from a pre-established franchise (despite being a mobile game) has helped significantly.- A very crisp UI that's easy to navigate and look at.- In depth weapon customization that impacts both the performance and look of the weapons- A decent range of environments and scenarios to play in, even if there are only two zones.- Fair enemy variety- Satisfying gunplayCONS:- ""Grindy"" in nature, as the upgrades don't neccesarily follow your progress thoughout the game, requiring you to replay levels even after you've completed all of the secondary challanges- A limited weapon selection, all weapons feel somewhat samey- Easily exploited AI allows you to blind fire with impunity. Later levels have you needing to deal with hostiles that spawn on your flank, but if so desired, you can sit in cover forever.- Few lines of dialogue gets old fast."

As I discovered it's way to easy to spend to much money pimping your starting guns, and later discover your horrible mistake. And the only solution is to gind and grind your economy up again, so you can get better armour, more items, and better weapons(remeber to upgrade them as well.

You can just follow the tracer rounds so it is possible to see where you're firing but when the baddies come up close then you cannot see them in front of you.Not sure if this is just a problem on my end but it doesn't really take anything away from Overkill.My only issues with Overkill are the character models are just not that exciting and what they have come up with just look..well odd.  Personally I think they should've just stuck a to more normal looking military uniform.And the weapon sounds, especially the baddies.

The terrain is jumbled and provides cover for both you, and your enemies.One of the things I like best about combat is the ""two controller approach"" to the submachine guns.  It adds both accuracy and realism, as both hands are now involved in aiming, and the second controller vibrates as well to make it feel like you are actually holding a weapon.You also have to manually insert your clip, instead of just pressing a button, which makes reloading that much more realistic.Just got finished playing my first session, and my legs are already tired from crouching behind cover.

Though bugs still exist, the developers have responded very quickly to bugs and criticisms. This gives me faith that the game will grow and move in the right direction.Since I now give this game a thumbs up, here are the pros and cons:Pros:1) Highly responsive developers.2) In depth gun / character progression with many choices.3) A ""Time Crisis"" esque, arcade-style, gameplay where you pop in and out of cover.4) Contains mini-bosses and turret segments that spice up the game when popping off trash mobs becomes a chore.Cons:1) Not very pretty - The graphics are quite polygonal and textures for many objects are flat/static pictures.2) Suffers from ""chest high wall"" syndrome - Sure, it's a cover based shooter... but you can have cover that is taller than you to peak around. I spent most of my playtime so far sitting on the ground due to the height of cover.3) Some collision boxes are inaccurate. Sometimes enemies were able to shoot through solid objects.TLDR: It has a ways to go to become polished, but you can most certainly find $20 worth of entertainment here."

I like it!It's good for a quick blast. Unless you have thighs of solid steel, that's about all you'll find yourself capable of doing. The action has echoes of Time Crisis' cover based pop-and-shoot mechanics with the awesome addition of a decent enough gun customisation system. It's a pretty robust carrot-on-a-string that's well paced and addicting.The devs are remarkably transparant and listen to feedback, the game is getting substantial updates and appears to be getting better with time.It's good fun for the price but if you're looking for a highly polished, well produced action game- Look elsewhere. If you want something that's fun to throw on and have a good time with for a few minutes I highly recommend shelling out for it, I definetly got a lot more mileage out of it than it's current VR contemporaries and for the price- I can't really complain."

U shoot, reload and cover, what feels great. But u could stay in cover all the time couse no one will try to flank u. I guess there wont spawn more enemies before u kill the already existing, so u wont get overwhealmed after taking cover and not shooting for too long.After a while u get used to it and u spray one-handed with ur assault-rifle over ur cover and hit. there should be better benefits of holding a heavy weapon with 2 hands. It is more fun playing like a real soldier but easier to lie on ur homefloor and spray like crazy. i dont think the game was meant to play like this, so it shouldnt be possible or that easy to play like this.Sniping is so very cool and when u have a riflestock for ur controlers and u get used to to AGOC u can keep both eyes open and aim for heads and be aware of ur suroundings what feels soo realy badass. unfortunately there is no map where ur in need of the higher ranged scopes. i realy would like a snipermap with a long range where u maybe cover alied troops or something.For the amount of maps u level too slow and earn to less money so u have unlocked all levels and u need to play them again to 'grind' xp and money for buying weapons. it is cool to play maps again but it would be much cooler if u would score for headshots, multi kills, time not getting hit or streaks without missing...etc  and at the end u can compare to your old bestscore (or others if u want)i bought the game on sale but i think it´s worth its normal price and it should not miss in any vr libary."

The enemys are well made, they dont feel stupid (AI seems quite OK) and control as well as the gameplay feels very good and immersive. Bear in mind that Overkill VR actually is a wave-based shooter, so you actually dont move freely or even teleport more than between the waves and levels. If you enjoy wave-shooters you will probably love this game!The aiming is a bit awkward at times, especially if you add a laser dot and laser sight on the weapons. Well, that could be just me, so I wont judge the game for that. Roomscale is working good in the game, as I can hide behind walls and take a few steps in every direction inside of my gameplay area.In the video above, Im playing Overkill VR from the first mission and about half an hour into it, and Im getting the feeling that you probably have more than 30 hours of gameplay in front of you if you buy this game, as it looks like there are loads of coming-up levels on the mission map. The developers says its about 40 hours of gameplay in total, and I dont doubt that actually! And thats not a bad thing either, because at this point we are still not spoiled with content in most of the VR games. 10+ hours of pure action gameplay in OverKill VR is highly welcome for most of us, I guess!I will continue this review when I have played some more hours into Overkill VR, but for now I really like this game and could recommend it to anyone who likes FPS games and wave-shooters!"
,Recommended,518720,30132550,Posted: 23 February,all,VetteofSD,"I was surprised at the amount of negative reviews for this. It's one of the few different shooters currently available that actually runs well and has a fair amount of content. Sure, it has its areas that need refinement, but overall, its one of the better VR games right now.A great example of how this game plays is the Time Crisis arcade games.The Pros:1: Great selection of different guns to choose from (~15)2: Excellent amount of gun customization available (triggers, magazines, barrels, etc. ~4 tiers each)3: Difficult! a lot of games are way too easy nowadays. Nice to actually have a challenge for once4: Good amount of levels. You will definitely have to spend a fair amount of time to complete the game.The Cons/Needs Improvement:1: Cover refinement/Collisions- I've been crouched behind cover and watched enemy bullets come right through and hit me...2: SWITCHING HANDS NEEDED: I'm left-handed. As far as I can tell, there is no way to flip the controls so I can have my primary hand be my left. You can't just switch controllers since the reload buttons will now be on the inside of your palm.3: Cover Height: I'm quite tall, (6'3""), some of the pieces of cover you're supposed you use are very short. If I'm in a crouched position, my head sticks out like a mannequin head on a table. Some of the ""red"" hard cover spots, I have to lay flat on the floor to actually fit behind it an not get hit. This might be related to the collisions issue, but is still a problem.Despite the cons, it is a fun, good looking game that you can easily come back to. It's a few patches and updates from being a very solid game. It's also one of the better shooter games that isn't horror or zombie based. So if you're looking for something a bit different and like a good arcade-style shooter, you'll have fun with this."

I get that it's tough at this point and most VR games are trying to nail down more fluid and natural movement, but it's still a disappointment when standing still is all you do.The AI is rather dumb, and all you have to do is wait for them to reload every time before just shooting them again.Graphics: 7/10Graphics for the environment are really nice but the character models are kinda meh. It's disappointing that it's just a floating gun and you can't see much of your character model.

The reloading alone made me furious as there is no explanation or logic to how it works.How about press the A botton to eject the clip and maybe be able to pick up a new clip before you eject so its ready to go.Make grabbing a gun with two hands a function of the gripping buttons on the left controler, not having it just stick hen it gets close. becuase it draggs your gun around when you want to let go .The guns seemed to have wildly fluctuating fire rates. As in, between shots on the same gun the fire rate sped up or slowed down to the point I wasnt sure if it was firing on auto or semi auto. Is there a way to change between semi and full auto? I have no idea.The idea of handling guns and shooting is awesome.  But it needs to be seemless and intuitive.  This game may get there. but not right now."

It looked like it was going to be exciting and awesome.I would like to say first , that it's not a bad game, it may well suit many people, I would like to give it a middle sort of rating, I can't reccomend it, but I'm not 100% happy giving it a thumbs down.So it plays fine, it runs ok when it runs, but the gun play doesn't track as acurately as I feel it could (other VR games are far more accurate in my experience).The enemies are dull, they pose no threat at all really until the end level vehicle, and that is when you have to duck, once, stand, and waste it. Otherwise I never felt the need to even cover. Yes you could argue that I'm not playing it properly, and I agree, but I had no sense of fear or danger or urgency.The enimies are also repetetive in looks and actions.The two handed control probably works great with a 3D printed rifle, but two handed gun play like this is extremly un natural, I ended up holding every gun like a pistol with 2 hands to avoid the poor aiming I suffered with the mechanic.I also experienced several freezes in the game menu, requiring restart, and occasionally the frame rate would just tank for a few seconds.Then the final straw for me was after the latest patch, it loaded fine, went to the menu fine, entered arena and one eye went black. Tried several possible fixes, but this did not happen in any other game nor in Overkills menu, only the game. VR one eyed is weird as all hell. (AMENDMENT : The one eye black issue turned out to be a Vive issue that happened to present itself first in Overkill and then happened in other games too, please disregard the one eye black issue)Requested a refund, sorry devs, it was a nice try, but it's not for me, I will be keeping an eye on your future productions though.i7 6700k16BG RAMSapphire R9 390 - 8GBSSD drive."

,Recommended,518720,33332714,Posted: 6 July,all,Cyrix,"It's all right. The graphics aren't great nor terrible. Gameplay is decent; it's remniscent of arcade games like Time Crisis, where you warp to a position, shoot at the enmies that spawn around you until you've killed a certain number, then move to the next position. There's always some crates or barrels or whatever to hide behind. Cover-based shooting is fun in VR, but most of the cover is waist-high which is completely exhausting to hide behind since you can't lean on it.A glaring and immediate problem is that there is almost no haptic feedback; the controllers barely vibrate when you shoot. This really harms the immersiveness of the game.The progression/unlock system feels heavily inspired by mobile games, though thankfully there's no IAP and it's not balanced to require 1000 hours of grinding to unlock each new gun or upgrade. However, there aren't enough missions to justify the number of guns and upgrades available. I finished all of the missions long before I had unlocked all of the guns, not because the guns take a long time to unlock, but because there are only enough missions for a few hours of play.It's clear that this game was structured for far more missions than they actually have, suggesting they abandoned the game before finishing it. There is an achievement for getting your character to rank 45, but by rank 15 you'll probably have finished all of the missions. There are 9 armor upgrades to buy, but you'll only have purchased the first two or three by the time you finish the game. You're free to go back and replay previous levels at any time, but there isn't much motivation to do so.$20 is a bit steep for what you get, but I could see myself spending more than $20 to play this repeatedly at an arcade, and it's deeper than an arcade game. With that in mind, I'll give it a weak recommendation."
76561197961860435,Recommended,518720,34376615,Posted: 20 August,all,Whyte.Oni,"This is a generic shooting gallery in VR, and that's exactly what I wanted!MISSION/STORY PROGRESSION:Each mission has objectives, clear all four objectives, you get four stars. Future levels are locked by a certain number of stars, thus you don't have to be perfect at all missions to still make progress. There really isn't anything in the way of an actual story, but there really didn't need to be one.UPGRADING GEAR:This is simple: Money. Do missions, complete objectives, get paid. Need a better gun? Larger magazines? Better scope or a laser pointer? No problem, just grind to get the cash. Each gun has a great selection of upgrades, Barrels, barrel attachemnts (comps and suppressors), optics, lights and lasers, triggers, stocks, and of course paint jobs. While there is technically some limitations based on level requirements, I doubt you'll be able to afford the weapons before you've made it to the appropriate level.GAMEPLAY:Pretty straight forward here, which makes it fantastically easily to jump in and have fun. Point, pull trigger, repeat until you need to reload. At this point you have some getting used to. Squeeze the side buttons on the gun hand and the mag drops out, the off hand has to come up and then back down to replace the mag. Squeeze the side buttons on the off hand controller to switch weapons. You can, for long guns at least, do a double handed pose where the off hand ""grips"" the barrel of the gun to provide better accuracy and stability. This principle works in real life very well, but not so muh in game (in my experience). This is why you'll want to pull down your off hand in reloads quickly so as to not confuse the game that you are trying to ""two hand"" your weapon. Finally, in missions ther will be little hoverring drones you can shoot down for power ups.TIPS:* Get lasers as quickly as possible for any gun you intend to use.* Hold rifles one handed and use the laser to aim.* Avoid arm fatigue by not extending your fulling, instead keep it close to your chest.* If there is cover to your side, use it! Lean out hen needed. If there is lower cover in front of you, take a kneww and stay there. Bouncing up and down, side to side will tire you, mess up your aim, and could tangle you in wires.VERDICT:9 / 10 - I have a few gripes with the pacing, the graphics could definitely be better, and there are some fit and finish issues, but they are all minor. Overall, I am very happy with this game, and it has become my second favorite VR experience (first is Star Trek: Bridge Crew, and I think I was born to play that game, so second place is really the best anyone else is every going to get). I look forward to seeing what Straloop does next, and would certainly be willing to put down more cash for more content in their current offering (read: will DLC)."
