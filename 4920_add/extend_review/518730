,Recommended,518730,26147913,"Posted: 21 October, 2016",all,LadyOberon [#GamersRule],"Initial ImpressionFor me, this was a perfect example of thecasual shooter. I'm not very adept with FPS games, so a game like this allows me to get myshmupon without a challenge that exceeds my gaming abilities.Thegraphicswere super sharp and original. Thesoundtrackwas appropriate and enjoyable without being a nuisance. Repetitive games like these can often include a soundtrack that grates on the nerves, but this one pleasantly accompanies the action. Thecontrolswere very responsive and worked exactly as they should. This is most certainly a game for anyone who likes to grab a controller and relax on the couch.GameplayThe gameplay mechanics are relatively simple, aiming and shooting through waves of enemies of varying degrees. There are a wide variety of enemies to fight, and each has its own unique characteristics, whether it be a balloon flying zombie or one that heals other mobs. Each type of mob is a different challenge, and the game steadily combines those challenges to see just how well you can think and react on the fly. You also have friendly refugees that yield rewards,if you happen to not kill thembefore they cross the finish line to safety.Good luck with that; I know I killed more than I saved(oops)but sure had a lot of fun doing it.During the game, you'll unlock the other two members of your team, abomberand asniper. Weapons and attributes for each of the 3 characters can be upgraded multiple times with gold obtained from killing enemies and saving refugees. There are also special attacks thatblow dynamite,stop time, andrain bombsfrom above to thin out the herd of zombies. You can also upgrade things like blast radius and increase the effectiveness of special attacks, like time stop, with diamonds which are obtained for completing levels.ConclusionThis is a game that can be completed in one sitting, easily. In fact, Imaxed out all possible upgrades and unlocked 100% of the achievements in just over 4 hours. It was a fun game that didn't require a lot of puzzle solving, and it wasn't one of the many games saturating the market that are either inferior or just plain hard for the sake of being difficult. I definitely recommend this game for casual gamers and achievement hunters."

,Recommended,518730,30489936,Posted: 13 March,all,Wazig,"I finished this game and unlocked all achievements in less than 3 hour. Zombo Buster Rising is a casual and easy shooter. I recommend it if you like casual games and want an easy shooter/tower defense in your library. This game is suitable for both kids and adults.Remember: ZBR is a short game. So buy it only if you really want a casual title and you like to play such titles. Plus, ZBR has a cheap price so I don't think you will waste your money. Good game and I want to see more game from the developer, e.g. ZBR sequel(s)."

Nothing out of expectation but still good for time killing. Worthwhile if you buy it on sale.Only one let-down: I was expecting switching among the three characters for different gaming experience ... but no such an option.

,Not Recommended,518730,34880090,Posted: 11 September,all,Karma,+ Easy achievements+ Nice art-style- No windows mode- Takes only 1 hour to beat- Only one level layoutI would recommend this game but same time I would not. You are stuck with 1 layout for the entire game and the only thing new is the zombies but some are so similar to others you don't really have a hard time beating them.Heck I beat the game 100% without using any of the items in my backpack and that includes losing no hearts on the final boss. It is not a hard game and you can beat it 100% within 1-2 hours.For that I say get it when it is on sale and not full price. Even at £1.59 it does not really have any replay value unless you like endless mode but that is really up to you and how you see how much money you would spend for the hours given.But it is not a game I would return to even if I had not 100% it.
,Recommended,518730,35231632,Posted: 26 September,all,Trilion,"Worth purchasing at full price.Zombo Buster RisingIt's a defense strategy game where you defend your base from waves of zombies of various types. You start with a single hero and gain two more shortly into the game. Each hero are static and can't move and each has their own unique weapon and you're given three special abilities to assist you in your defense. I completed it and obtained the 24 achievements after 2 and a half hours of playing. I were moderately engrossed in the game while watching a movie, so there's not much thought required to play the game. I bought it with a 90% discount coupon for a mere 0.20€ and I do consider the game worth the original 2€ price tag as it's not a bad game. However, I wouldn't place it at the same level of other games here on Steam as it's more of a web Java / WebGL game. The game exists both on iOSApp Storeand AndroidGoogle Play.The graphics are cartoonish and the sounds are decent but slightly repetitive as the background music is on a loop. The game lacks any graphical settings except two audio sliders. There's no built in Windowed Mode. However, you can somewhat force this by using the Windows shortcut [Left Alt] + [Enter].ConclusionI'm recommending the game to anyone who wants to consume some time without much thought and anyone who wants a cheap game for achievements and Steam badges.FeedbackPosting your own experiences with Zombo Buster Rising whether good or bad assists newcomers in making their decision in whether to purchase the game or not."

A little more variety in the gameplay and the maps would have been great, however.I'm forced to give it a negative review because this game is sold as Linux compatible, but it doesn't start on my main computer (the first mission freezes) and i got no reply from the support."

76561198072155841,Recommended,518730,30393001,Posted: 8 March,all,zeranixaimar,"This is a simple shooting game in which you defend your base against coming waves of zombies. You earn money in stages and shinning stars by completing stages. Since the game is generally easy, with a little effort in grinding, you can max out all the characters and skills and beat the boss without problem.This game gave me three hours of fun. So it is a recommendation for those who like shooting zombies."

,Recommended,518730,32113168,Posted: 1 June,all,Trim The D,"It's a good, slight distraction for a couple hours. The progression is fast enough, despite having to grind at some points. It's a bit underwhelming and much shorter than I anticipated, but luckily that means it doesn't overstay its welcome. It's short and sweet and something I'm willing to recommend, especially at such a cheap price!"
,Recommended,518730,32332005,Posted: 10 June,all,blomeland,"Short and sweet. I reached the end with 96% of the achievements in two hours. Although I had to replay a few of the levels, overall it was on the easy side and I beat the boss on my first attempt.There's an endless mode and I tried it once, but it seems pointless as there's nothing left to discover or improve once you reach it."
