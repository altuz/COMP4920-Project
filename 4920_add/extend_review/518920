It feels like an early access title with very little content and lots of bugs.It's WAY too easy for your virtual hands to get stuck because the game thinks you're trying to clip through something. The collision is really, really stingy and it makes the whole experience feel very clunky.I also don't like the grip mechanics here... In the original game, it made sense to have full control of all your fingers, but here, it only gets in the way. The trigger should be used to grip with the thumb+index finger and the thumb pad should be used to close the rest of the hand. Having to hold the grip buttons to keep your hands closed is tiring and annoying.I'm also having some pretty weird performance issues. My framerate keeps dropping even though my computer is MORE than capable of running much more visually impressive games in VR than this (I have a GTX 1070).Cannot recommend right now. Wait for some patches and more content."

Bashing someone's skull in with a hammer kills them, huh.""I don't really need to expand on that thought process, but I'll say that SS:ER is not just a VR port. Much like the Advanced Edition, ER takes everything the previous iteration was and adds more. If you thought the mouse controls were clunky, worry not! This version lets you control the game with your hands and pretty much remains just as clunky but in my eyes that's a good thing.3D controls add a certain freedom and speed to the game, however, where if previously you could only watch organs fly out of reach you can now simply step over and pick them off the floor, good as new. Not to mention the several new features added such as different camera positions displayed on the in-game screen.Unless you have a serious aversion to surgery done terribly, terribly wrong, get this game. It's worth it."

Much easier to get things done than the Original keyboard and mouse version haha!  Love how there is a nice slapping noise for when you smack the patient.  the satisfaction of smashing out all their teeth with a hammer is just too much.  Also doing surgeries in twenty seconds or less feels pretty good!The thing that i noticed that changed and i didn't appreciate was how you can't poke the eyes out with just a pen or a pencil (in the eye surgery) instead of having to use a knife.If you are seriously complaining about the controls of this game, you don't know what you're talking about because most of the fun about the original game (keyboard and mouse) was trying to do serious surgery with the ♥♥♥♥♥iest controls possible.

The reason being is that you pay so much for a game you already own, just in VR. To be fair it's so much fun, but way too easy. It's so easy you could beat the game in 45 minutes. 45 minutes to finish the game unacceptable for a VR game and charging full price! Instead this should be a DLC for the original game or at least get a discount if you own the previous non-vr game. The game is what you expect it to be, except there are no extra content which made it very disappointing. If I do get a refund, and this game gets big free DLCs... I will definitely pick it up again."

You also can't use the hands very much because they disable when you reach in the body.The people you do the operation on die way too easy. It may be a good thing that you have to do the operation good, but you can't because of the problem I stated above.Now for the last thing, the equipment doesn't turn off once you turn it on, for example the drill, it sound way too annoying and can't turn off.I wouldn't get it in this state, it's overpriced."

Without reading a single review, I purchased this.I regret it.The original SS was frustrating in a goofy and fun sort of way. It was part of the charm.The control scheme on the Vive, relying heavily on the side grips, is infuriating. And not in a fun sort of way. A simple improvement might be to simply make the side grip a toggle, allowing you to readily manipulate the index and thumb but easily keeping the other fingers out of the way. As is, it's too annoying to bother with."

76561198160723419,Recommended,518920,28247052,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,tornwingss,"I loved this game, Ive read allot of mixed reviews so far and the biggest complaint is the grab mechanics. Yes the controls are very touchy and awkward because you have to use pretty much all of the buttons, the grip button touch pad button and trigger. However that being said, its still a solid game. this is a 100% port of the original surgeon simulator to VR. It is pretty damn easy to complete when your actually using your hands instead of having to manipulate the controller. So in my opinion the fact that you ""get"" to use your hands to perform surgeries instead of a controller more than makes up for the ocasional clipping issue or awkward button assignments. All in all i would rate this a 7.5/10. Its not very challenging, the mechanics need to be smoothed out a bit. but its still every bit as fun and funnny as the original. I only hope that the DEVS decide to expand on this game and give us some more levels instead of re-inventing the wheel. If they're going to step things up and make this game a VR title they need to be prepared to give us more content simply because by making this a VR title they made it twice as easy to get through."
