,Recommended,519140,29864722,Posted: 11 February,all,Ross Delgado,"Initially, the game was p spoopy. The giant ape wouldn't stop turning off my lights and wacking off behind my doors. But, there came a point where I was put in a maze that I don't recall ever installing in my basement. The elevator also seemed a little off but we'll save that for another time. However, a point arose where I needed to go full on Putin and hack the pants off three computers. Luckily, my hacking skills are top notch and I only needed to press one key. But, alas, there was an obstacle. This absolute mongoloid fresh out of the thunder dome kept chasing me. But, with a few masterful manuevers I was able to put the slimey ape on skates. His ankels looked like he was fresh off the boat from somalia after I was done with him. His career was absolutely ended. Along with this tard's inability to perform proper defensive technique, he also struggle with shooting the gap between door frames. On multiple occasion my persuer was halted at least six times because the gosh darn bunglard couldn't squeeze his thunder thighs through the ""slim"" doors. Over all, I like the crossover between horror and the NBA 2K series. The opportunity to dance around the dude trying to swipe my ball and pull up when he ain't woke is 10/10."

,Recommended,519140,29763191,Posted: 7 February,all,I Dont Play Cs anymore,"Minds Eyes is a decent game, lasts about 30-45 minutes and they tell you its meant to be played in one sitting and that's okay. The story behind it is kind of generic, however, there are jump scares that made me jump and that's not easy to do to me lol. It was pretty cool and because its free of course i'd reccomend it. It is a free 30-45 minutes of horror fun."
76561198018258741,Recommended,519140,30208103,Posted: 26 February,all,GandalfTheGay,"I really don't get all the bad reviews. Yeah it has plenty cliche stuff and some annoying moments but it's a fun and short free horror game. The lack of interaction that was felt during the sitting was there but it made it somehow special or different. I didn't get the part with the safe and teddy bears (i only got 2 and i am sure i was everywhere)...I would highly recomment upgrading the ,,Bad guy,, - his running animation was just pure garbage.Overall it was a fun experience that took me 30min.."
