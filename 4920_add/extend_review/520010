I was skeptical at first because for some reason I thought it was a shallow VR ""experience"". I could not have been more wrong, Climbey is one of the most engaging and wildly fun titles for VR. Tons of content to play through thanks to the Steam workshop and a great community. You will not regret picking this one up, it is a MUST HAVE VR app!"

I got sweaty palms.Con: Jumping control is really bad. I got to level 11 and couldn't get used to it. It feels like my jumping velocity is literally my controller velocity at the single frame when I released trigger. It's super hard to grasp that single frame. At least do a lerp for like, recent 10 frames, so player can have more consistant feel of control."
,Recommended,520010,34569839,Posted: 28 August,all,byteframe,"I wonder if this was made by the same people who made 'Cavey', a small climbing/caveman simulator that was guide good. There was a mountain in it, and you collected firewood, and berries and hid in the cave during the night. I'd rather be reviewing that right now, because as you already well know Climbey is great! It's the bees knees, the cat's PJ's, and the best climbing game there is. I don't know about CryTek's The Climb, and 'To the Top' was lame, but Climbey is where it's at! It has multiplayer and helpful systems, andpremiumVR gymnastics and locomotion. Plenty of levels to explore, and you get terribly vertical! It's got that VR blocks aesthetic and that, but that allows for lots of levels and larger scales, for awe. It's worth 10 bucks, plus a tip, and they are snappy with the updates.I'm told it has coop too, but I've not tried it. Unless Bob (from steam) wants to play? Ring-Ring. Let's see if he gets this message.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=904395331"

Tried the demo and within minutes, came to the conclusion that this was a MUST BUY, especially for only 10 dollars! The climbing is fun and challenging in a similar fashion to puzzle platformers such as Portal and the like. Workshop support and level design also make this pretty much infinitely replayable. Great use of motion/momentum controls for combining room-scale and large-scale movement. As an early access title it has nowhere to go but up and it is already fantastic!Would recommend to anyone looking for a game that gives back way more than just 30 minutes of entertainment!

,Recommended,520010,26228936,"Posted: 26 October, 2016",all,Monogamous,"This may be my new favorite VR experience. After trying the demo I was hooked by the way it felt to basically do super-human VR parkour. I would HIGHLY recommend trying the demo, especially since it is free and you have nothing to lose. Even though it is limited it does a great job showcasing the potential with the game. However, I wasn't prepared for the feeling I would have going through the various levels in the full game.The game's movement mechanics really lend themselves to VR and is what sets this game apart from anything else on the Vive. It's easy to get completely immersed once you start pumping your arms like a sprinter and start swinging around and flying through the air like some sort of crossfit Spiderman. The amount of freedom you have when completing the level is what I really love about the game and it utilizes room scale nicely. There are so many ways to tackle the various obstacles and challenges that are placed before you. Also since there is a more natural mapping to how your actions translate to movement in the game I didn't experience any type of motion sickness whatsoever and felt empowered beyond imagination. However, if you do get motion sickness there are options to help minimize this.There were two moments I experienced that really blew me away and solidified this game as one of my favorites. The first is when instead of trying to climb across a beam to cross a gap I decided to just jump as high and far as I could. After swinging my arms downward as hard as I could I basically did a Hulk jump and somehow landed directly on the goal after flying through the air for a few seconds. The second was when I had to reach a goal that was below me that I had to reach while flying through the air at high speed. Based on my trajectory it looked like I was going to barely miss it so I dove on the ground backwards at the last second and was able to barely grab the goal.The fact that this game will have online play AND a level editor which allows for community created content makes me fully anticipate that the replay value for this game will be off the charts. I can't wait to see what this game becomes because right now it is looking like it may be the start of something epic!"

It's not as competitive as I thought when buying it but instead it turned into a very nice social experience like rec room which is even better.

It's so much fun climbing along the courses, flinging yourself to the next grip, plummeting to your death only to respawn and try again. Honestly, I was surprised just how well the movement works. You can walk into the direction you're looking by swinging your arms or alternatively ""throw"" yourself around the world by ""grabbing the air"" with both hands. Of course you can also climb along climbable walls by just grabbing them.Did I mention how much fun it is?And I haven't even tried multiplayer or the level editor yet...Highly recommended!"

Graphics looked simple, gameplay seemed pretty boring.Then I launched the tutorial, and the first jump I made, I got hooked. Do *not* trust videos, this is something you need to experience to truly understand how absolutely awesome, addictive and satisfying it is. The game is full of ideas that keep you on your toes (anti-gravity, trampolines, etc), the levels are very intelligently designed, and there's a lot to work with in the Workshop.If you remember the good old days of Kreedz Climbing back in the heydey of HL2 mods, this is the same feeling you'll get. Really recommend it."
,Recommended,520010,27711235,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,Master Chef,"With all of these uber-realistic mountain climbing VR games on the market, Climbey takes the climbing genre (if there is such a thing) in an entirely new direction. Nothing about this game is realistic, instead cartoony and colorful. The mechanics of jumping and climbing feel good, and well geared for fast paced action. In addition to a multitude of built-in levels (all of which can be replayed to get a better time) Climbey comes with Steam Workshop funcionality. Any level can be played in a lobby of four people, and (unlike some other VR games at the moment) the servers seem active. To me, playing through the built-in levels on my own would have been worth the money. The Workshop levels and online capabilities put this game on another level. If you own a Vive, get Climbey."
,Recommended,520010,28734451,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,Sarkames,"My favourite VR game. It doesn't utilise the teleportation method of travel as most VR games do and I absolutely love it for that. It's much more immersive needing to skillfully jump to get around, with the bonus of being able to run by swaying the controllers back and forth similar to running in place. Also has multiplayer and that's a huge plus for me; not many VR games currently support multiplayer and the few ones that do are also the highest rated -- surely not a coincidence, it's fun to interect with others in VR.Simple Pro/Con list for lovers of TL;DR-style:PROS:Multiplayer if you can manage to get players together for it. You can even grab onto other players' hands and they can help pull you up if you're struggling to progress. Lion King all over again.Level editor. Not a big fan of it since it's in VR mode and not on the desktop, but it exists and for those people willing to stand up in their room for possibly hours and meticulously craft a level, I appreciate your dedication.Immersive movement. I can run, jump, and even use gestures with other players. Not everybody's a fan of manual movement and they might prefer teleportation to avoid nauseau, but I personally love it.Challenging, but not because I feel limited in what I can do. (like in other VR games)Updated frequently. (As of December, 2016)You can play ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" with people online. Or just flip them off. I'm not judging anybody.Great workout: Save money on gym, flail arms around in your room while wearing expensive blindfold, profit.A good amount of content for the price. Also a good amount of custom levels, some of which are very nicely-designed maps.CONS:Not many players, but as this game does have niche appeal, it's understandable. It's also a game that can be very physically demanding to play with all of the motions involved, so what players are around will likely tire out quickly.It can be very buggy at times. It's not fair to dock anything for this as the game's freedom of controls allows for many variables and in general this isn't a rare issue with VR games as they're all early designs. There are a few technical issues, but nothing as severe as crashing or being unplayable. Again -- fully expected to have lots to iron out with a game like this. I hope to see this game a lot more polished in the future.Minimal graphics. For some probably too minimal. I personally like the clean look, wouldn't mind a few more choices for aesthetic.Final thoughts:Would love to see a desktop version of the level editor included and more graphical options since the game is fairly barebones in its appearance so far. Aside from those gripes, it's my favourite VR game and at a great price."

This game is worth full asking price. It has built in campaign, which is just courses with no storyline.  It has coop as well. The best part is that anyone can make a map and submit via the steam workshop. Adding new user-created maps is as easy as clicking a button. I suggest playing this with some music running in the background because it doesn't have any on its own."

,Recommended,520010,34399632,Posted: 21 August,all,DATASTORM,"Climbey has produced by far the most consistently enjoyable gameplay sessions of the many VR games I have played. The climbing and jumping mechanics pioneered by this game give you a great feeling of presence and agency over your movement. The game also makes great use of the Steam workshop combined with its Built-in VR level editor.Crucially, I have found the multiplayer sessions to be surprising good, with most players willing to help out newer users with the somewhat steep learning curve. There are certainly frustrating parts to the game, but these are overshadowed by the pure satisfaction of simply overcoming them.The physics and net code are excellent, with dedicated servers delivering a level playing field and consistent play sessions for all users.I wouldn’t be put off by the early access nature of the game. As it stands there are hundreds of community levels, many of which are well made and offer interesting mechanics and challenges."
,Recommended,520010,33624680,Posted: 18 July,all,Vyte,"So far this is my favorite VR title, and actually well priced at 10$ while some other games feel more like 40$ demos.Its in early access right now, but the only thing i hope for them to improve on is the multiplayer experience and the method of choosing what maps you want to play; since its kind of confusing.Only real dissapointment is that i cant play more of it; a 1 hour session of real tough levels and my body aches like ive had a full body workout, that just might be me though because iam out of shape lol.Great multiplayer experience, had many laughs and overall good/funny moments, like ive said before though, hope they can improve it a bit more so this game can go from what feels to be a 9/10 to a 10/10"
,Recommended,520010,28247003,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,hunt.topher,"Like many other reviewers, I was initially turned off by the bland graphics and simple premise. It's like Mario 64 in VR - except no plot, no colors, no enemies, and no music. But once you step in and start jumping around, it's wild fun. You're scrambling up ledges, out of breath and hands sweaty, arms sore, then trying to time a jump onto a moving platform, and when you make it you feel like the coolest person in the world. Once you master the built-in maps, there's a large and growing collection of player-made maps to test your skills on.And once you try out multiplayer, there's no going back. Doing Tarzan leaps around a giant playground with five other people (in the snow! With santa hats!), giving someone a thumbs-up, or reaching out to grab someone's hand because you can't reach the ledge, is super addictive. The voice chat is nicely done; a player's voice gets louder when you're close to them so there's a real sense of space and distance, and it's hilarious to hear people yell in despair as they miss a jump.Whenever it's time for a VR break, I glance over my library of games, all of which have ""more things to do"" and/or much prettier graphics than Climbey does. Then I boot up Climbey anyway and hop into a multiplayer room, because that's the experience that I look forward to the most."

It is so great! climbing with friends is a lot of fun!Even when alone, I keep coming back to it. There is always new use-made maps and they are getting better and better every day. Sometimes I just try to beat my previous times by finding new paths.Climbey is certainly one of the 10 best game of VR and it's very affordable! Get it!!I must warn you though: it is challenging! You will get hot and sweaty, you will have a hard time learning to jump well. Stick with it, the learning curve is not as steep as it seems on the first impression and it is very rewarding. It's OK (and kinda normal) to struggle for the first hour or so.The base game features only 15 maps which I went through in only 3-4 hours. However the steam workshop integration is GREAT and there are tons of custom-made maps.You can change the skybox (the paris eiffel tower 360 view is popular for a reason, it is so amazing to climb 1000feet above paris!)I've heard this game be called the Mario64 of VR and I agree! It does a great job of expanding on the ""classic"" VR styles (wave shooters and wave defenders and more wave shooters... yawn)Climbey is different and it is awesome. Buy it now."

The motion is fluid, many levels are quite fun and technical, and the multiplayer is a fantastic casual experience that's more engaging than Rec Room.One thing to note is that it will likely take at least an hour or so for you to acclimate to the motion unless you have an iron stomach (I had to take a significant break after the first half hour due to some motion sickness). My second session was better. As with other games that initially made me sick due to motion I wasn't used to (Lucky's Tale specifically), small and frequent hydration breaks generally help until you get used to it.I'll definitely be playing more of this.

,Recommended,520010,26424999,"Posted: 4 November, 2016",all,TheSambassador,"First and foremost - the actual core mechanics of this game are awesome.  The climbing feels great, the jumping feels AMAZING once you get the hang of it, and the comfort options mean that I don't feel any sickness whatsoever.Before I jump into how I don't like a lot of this game, I want to emphasize that I still recommend it.  It's still a ton of fun, and the core mechanics are almost enough to carry the game, but there ARE issues.  These are issues that are pretty much entirely due to level design, which can be fixed by the developer.It's early access, so poor level design is something that might improve, but the levels that come with the game feel like they were thrown together.  It really does not feel like any care or time was put into most of the levels past the tutorials.  The major problems are:- Difficulty curve that is all over the place.  Some levels have ridiculously precise jumps from walls that you need to do.  Then after those, you have some levels that are ridiculously easy, with almost no challenge at all.  The game lets you specify 3 checkpoints of your own per level, but some levels are so long that that is not nearly enough, and some levels are so short that even using 1 seems like overkill.- Lots and lots of waiting.  Most levels have moving platforms of some sort, and when you screw up, you'll spend a solid 5-10 seconds waiting for a platform to come back.  I got to what I think was level 10 or 11, with several platforms that each seemed to take over 10 seconds to rotate back around, and I got bored and closed the game.  It's a major problem in almost every one of the levels.- Lots of repetitive gameplay.  I enjoy jumping, then turning around, and jumping again... but I don't really enjoy doing the exact same jump 8 times in a row.  There are a lot of areas in the level that are very long, skinny platforms that just take a long time to walk across, and there's really no reason for them to be that long.  Same with several climbing-up-the-wall segments.  Moving through some of these levels feels like a chore.- Levels don't do a good job at eaching mechanics at all.  About 8 or 9 levels in, you're finally shown the sort of ""ice platform"" where you can get a lot of speed, but the game hasn't explained the mechanic at all, and never gave you the chance to really learn what to do with it.  That point in the level is preceded with... just a bunch of very easy to traverse moving platforms.  The dev could easily have taken the earlier parts of the level to gradually introduce the ice mechanic, but instead just makes you do it once for a HUGE jump that isn't intuitive at all.- Levels are just... not elegantly designed.  They feel thrown together.  Huge walls that are huge for no reason.  Some levels have multiple routes, some have a single route that's not obvious at all.  Lots of random jumping on tiny platforms.You can excuse some of this, the game comes with a built-in level editor, but I really hope that the dev takes some time and goes through each level with some more care.  Early levels should be teaching one or two mechanics, gradually increasing their difficulty, and then testing your mastery of those mechanics.  It's honestly missing that pretty much entirely as of right now."

This is a combination designed to get your stomach rolling. Not everyone will suffer, and I was fine at first, but once I got confident enough in the mechanics to start rocketing around the arenas I stopped feeling so good.Game also needs to spend more time on teaching you how to jump properly, and I think wall climbing needs to lock you in position so your slight arm movements (because there's no wall to actually hold and keep your steady) don't lead to the camera bobbing back and forth."

Hands down, best VR climbing game out at the time of this review. No question.I have been having a lot of fun with this game. I'm sure it will also be one of the games I show friends after they get the hang of VR.With the level editor and nice steamworkshop so you can try out other people's levels, I think this game is worth $10. I spent about an hour in the level editor and made a really cool level and submitted it. Right now there are only a few levels. It's looking like a few new levels are coming out each day. There'll probably be more this weekend since that'll give players the freetime to make more levels. If you were to just play the levels the game comes with, you'd finish the game in maybe 45 minutes to an hour.Unfortunlatly I couldn't find anyone online. It seems like one of those things where you and your friend have to agree to get online at the same time. The main problem I think is that the lobby forces someone to stand in an empty room and wait. This is a problem because it's super boring to wait, so the longest I've been able to make myself wait is about 3 minutes before I give up and just play singleplayer. Assuming everyone else is like me, there would never be any games online. I think it's be great if players could join you mid game. If the dev is looking for a method that involves writing no code, at least make the waiting room more of an open playground or something. Hell, just swap out that empty box room with the demo level. That'd be perfect.The number 1 reason why I love this game is the feeling of ""Don't look down, don't look down,♥♥♥♥♥♥I looked down."" Is soooo terrifying! The higher up I climb, the more I feel like I could fall and die. If you love being scared of heights in VR, you will absolutly love this game.

In Climbey you traverse massive levels by climbing, jumping, and walking through various obstacles in order to reach a destination. The most important thing with these kinds of games is accurate and satisfying movement and I feel that the developers have found that ""Super Meat Boy"" sweet spot in excellent traversal mechanics. The best thing about this game is that the movement for me (FYI I am very prone to motion sickness) did not cause me to get nauseas.Another great aspect of this game is the fact that you can climb with other people. The experience is a lot like AltSpace or Rec Room in that you can carry on conversations and interact physcially with people that are half-way across the world from you. Hell, I just played with a bunch of Frenchman (I live in the United States) and it was a lot of fun getting to talk and interact with people that come from a competely different continent from me.TL;DRThis is a great VR game that any Vive owner can throw a couple of hours into.

Movement in this game feels so real. To run you grab the grip buttons and move your hands and arms like you would if you were actually running.. well unless you're weird and run with your hands down like you're an anime ninja. Anyway, you jump by basically grabbing the air and pulling yourself into a jump. A ""Dyno"" in rock climbing terms. I would recommend changing the direction movement to controller rather than headset. Makes walking thin platforms easier in my opinion.So what makes this game so cool for me was the community in the game. Games filled up pretty quick, though most of the time with VR games for me it seems to be the time of day and when a game is new. Overall multiplayer was smooth. No lag when anyone connected, I grouped up with about six people no problem, and no lag with other players. I actually ended up getting taught by some kid which I thought was rather interesting. He showed me how to propperly jump, assisted me in climbing, and even let me hop on his backpack when I couldn't land some jumps. It was honestly wicked cool of that kid to show me. But I also saw how easy it was to teach the game. You could literally hold your hand out as an extra grab point and pull up someone. You can point at things, talk to them, and just interact with them on such a deeper level than traditional gaming. Then to have a workshop setup where you can create your own map only blows up that potential. I thought I got pretty good when I was beating most of the default maps on my first run around 1 min laps. Some other guys joined and banged out the same run in 20 seconds. Some craazy♥♥♥♥♥♥when you think someone is actually moving like that in real life.Overall I am happy with my purcahse.If I could recommend anything I'd say I would just polish up graphics a bit. The game is still a work in progress so before I actually say anything negitive I'd like to point out any and all flaws could potentialy be fixed by the time you read this. Really my only complaint is that the tutorial is actually hard if you've never played, which is the purpose of tutorials. Some parts are easy while others take some pretty good accurracy and skill to land. Tutorial should be more basic climbing and make it more apparently you have the ability to set check points. I saw a board that said checkpoint in the beginning that was just there, but I quickly read it and moved onto whatever seemed like a play button. It just needs some better guiding with a more forgiving course. Like a hole that you could practice climbing out of instead of a bottomless pit."

I don't feel any symptoms of motion-sickness until after an hour of gameplay!2. Most intuitive movement control system I've experience.3. Physics of falling and propelling yourself are good, although, you can jump like a grasshopper. That can be a bit disorienting.4. Steam Workshop Integration. I cannot stress how important this is. There are only 15 levels built in, the rest are all user made! Super cool, in my opinion.5. Multiplayer is good. Helping friends is neat, and voice chat is integrated.6. Add your own skyboxes and change your player color. Is there anything these guys didn't think of?Cons? Not many.1. The in game level creator / editor isn't very easy to use. I'm a slow learner though, so perhaps thats just me.2. Sometimes I notice a bug whilst walking, my game doesn't always register that I've let go of the grip buttons and try to keep walking. I have to click them again to make them register. I don't think this is limited to my Vive Controllers.Aside from that, GREAT GAME! Keep up the great work!"

Building a level within VR is incredibly intuitive, and it's a joy not to have to take the headset on and off for testing.And the MULTIPLAYER!! It's fun just to share in the challenge with other players and chat with them. Being able to help others out is highly satisfying as well.

,Recommended,520010,32729670,Posted: 24 June,all,Ganerumo,"Climbey is a fun if perfectible VR experience which, while a good introduction to more eccentric methods of locomotion, is lacking in content.GRAPHICSBy far not the game's strongest suit, Climbey has no art style to speak of. The minimalistic, purposefully WIP design is appreciable for how readable it makes each level, but the drawback is that the game is not particularly pretty or interesting to look at.GAMEPLAYClimbey's whole premise is in its name: you climb. That's really all there is to it. Locomotion is both based on arm-swinging and dragging yourself along surfaces onto which you can hold, with one or both hands. The player's interaction with each surface is simple enough: white blocks can be grabbed, grey blocks cannot, blue (ice) blocks are slippery and red (lava) blocks kill on impact.Past this, the game's fun factor entirely revolves around the levels themselves, which sadly aren't all good. The stock array of levels can be quite forgettable and often offer a single, fairly simple challenge based on one gimmick which varies every time. While user-created levels are often more daring and complex, if only for their attempts at being thematic (as much as the game's artstyle allows them, really), they are often extremely linear.Another issue of gameplay is the jumping. It is possible to leap across relatively short distances (albeit still far exceeding the average human ability) by grabbing onto the air and pulling back. While timing helps, the actual results is still mostly random and only becomes more difficult to control over longer jumps - and a dangerously high amount of levels rely heavily on jumping across particularly long distances. This creates a big problem especially when the player has to jump backwards or while holding onto objects, dozens of meters above the nearest surface. Community-made levels in particular over-utilize long distance jumps to the point of being infuriating.VR IMPLEMENTATIONClimbey in its current form would not be playable without VR. Motion-tracked hands is integral to gameplay but room-scale is relatively unneeded: due to the rather physical nature of the game it is obviously better to stand up clear of any other objects, but it is possible to play the entire game without ever moving your legs. The option to enable 90° turning via the touchpads also makes it possible to play entirely still without turning around, especially useful if you are confined to a 180° playspace.The game is relatively high on the discomfort scale: the lack of touchpad locomotion (arguably the most prone to causing simulation sickness) in favor of dragging/armswinging is rather comfortable in itself, but the game has a lot of forced movement in the form of slippery platforms, ziplines, trampolines and of course plenty of falling down. The sense of vertigo is also very prominent for obvious reasons and while the game does not pretend to be a cure for a fear of heights, enough time spent toying around with it will greatly dull the effect."

Climbing up monsterous towers and climbing window to window doing some really sick parkour throughout the city. Yeah, this is like that. With a strong community of builders on the workshop this game never seems to disappoint whenever I launch it. You're running, jumping, extending your arm as far as it can reach, and taking the leap of faith in every new level you play. You can take it easy or take on the hardest challenges made. This game can fit anyone's level of skill and it retains its fun every time you play. Surely a game on my top 5 list of VR games."

Not because the game itself is bad don't get me wrong it's one of my favourites but I strongly believe that there just isn't enough of the game to enjoy; not to mention the free demo you can get which show cases EVERYTHING about the game (I've spent more time in the demo then I have the game). The novelty just wears off and now that I'm more or less used to VR now it's become a worse experience for me. Many would argue that the steam workshop combatability creates limitless gameplay (to which I'd agree) it DOES not add new mechanics which the game in my opinion desperately needs.+The graphics are simplistic and cartoon-inspired which takes away the realism yet somehow adds to the fun.+Adrenaline is created through the vast heights and jumps you can make, but the novelty wears off+/- The robot is nice...? But I'd like to see him input more based on what you're doing and not what level you're on-The mechanics and novelty for me PERSONALLY just wear off too quickly to replay-The free demo is better then the game to a certain extent-The running locomotion is useless, found my self bunny hopping more then walking aroundOverall the game is still very nice and the potential here is large, this, in the future could be part of a massive open world VR genre and it brung out the inner parkour machine in me.

The graphics and art style leave a lot to be desired, but the rest of the game blew my expectations away.Climbey is a fun, simple game with potentially infinite content. This is the exact type of game I want to see on VR. Easy to pick up yet is challenging, has responsive controls, and tons of non-repetitive content. It doesn't require a lot of room to play either, despite how much movement is in the game. Most of your real life movement will be arm flailing. Your character is far from stagnant, however. The walking mechanic has restored my faith that future VR titles can do locomotion well. It works well and feels natural. Jumping works just fine as well, but it's tricky to be accurate with it, and is one of the hardest parts of the game. I'm not sure if I have just gotten more use to VR or if it's the natural movements you have to make with your body to walk and jump in this game, but I did not feel any m otion sickness.The user created levels expand the potential content of this game to the moon.  It's fun sitting in a lobby with other players and listent to the chit chat as every tries to make it through a course someone created.The game is a bit physically demanding. Not to a great degree, but enough to break you out in a sweat. Just know what you're getting into. This is not a relax and unwind kind of game.I think Climbey is a must-have for new VR owners.

Theres tons of user-created levels that are very well put together and make you think about your path up/around/under/over the obstacles in creative ways.Note: The demo is an older build of the game. One of the more notable things added to the full version is joystick free movement instead of having to pump your arms all the time.

But this game oh man.. maybe not graphicly but gameplaywise i think it probably beats it.Much props to the developper who made this. thank you!now for a bit of feedback: sometimes when moving fast it gets a bit jittery, i haven't found anything in the menu to fix that yet. i do have supersampling on 1.7 maybe if i reduce it, not sure. other games seem to be fine.the locomotion for running is awesome, i think they used armswinger for this. I hope in the future more games will use it. it's great, no motion sickness whilst running at all!for people who are prone to motion sickness , leave the floor grid on. It shows some cubes that represent your floor when you jump. I turned it off but got a bit woozy after a longer time of jumping around. Nut much, but you know, enough for me to turn it back on. No more problems!so far only played for 30min but i'll do alot more of climbing for sure :D"

Gameplay can vary from relaxed climbs helping others along the way to fast paced races.The integrated voice chat is really useful for easily communicating with other players, and the checkpoint system allows creators to adjust the difficulty of their levels as necessary.One hitch is I wish jumping wasn't so OP along with the ice physics.Everything else about this game is amazing.  Well worth your time and money."

I'm not sure why I took this long to put up a review when it's definitely one of my favorite (if not my favorite) game to play in VR. As someone who's had a pretty strong fear of heights, this game has surprisingly helped me overcome a bit of that fear and am now able to climb ladders with little anxiety. I ended up using a 360 photo of skyscrapers in Paris to add to the sensation and I believe one of the main reasons I was able to overcome some of that anxiety in real life. I still have moments where my feet and hands cramp up from levels that are open, difficult, and with very few checkpoints, but I actually enjoy these moments considering I've never felt this way outside of VR playing video games. I'd say this is a great game for seasoned VR players, but I'd extremely recommend it for those new to VR. I wish more games would adopt the climbing mechanics this game has brought to the table, but would like to see some map design and textures. The workshop features are also a great addition and probably the main reason I have so much time invested in this game. The game allows users, with creative minds, to build custom maps for the commuinity to download and play. I love it when theres a bunch of 4 or 5 star maps I haven't tried yet. They download in seconds so there's virtually no wait. This game is definitely a buy in my book and easily one I'd give 10-9.5/10."

Its amazing how you can make such a great game with controls this simple at first, when I tried the demo a long time back I thought the concept was great, but I couldn't stop myself from hating it. Reason? I didn't know how to jump! (its by holding both triggers by the way) I discovered this when I retryed the game a few months later and after that, I bought the game and started playing it like crazy whenever I can, and its still my most played game. SO worth only ten $ for this, I would have easily bought it for 30 or even 50 $.So get it now, because its worth it!"
