,Not Recommended,520270,25771174,"Posted: 29 September, 2016",all,Mumra,"This is just really overpriced for 3 very short coaster rides all set in the exact same environment, with nothing particularly unique about any of them, and nothing of any interest happening around you in the environment. The graphical quality isn't even particularly high. It's certainly quite an intense ride, but it would be a nice touch if the Vive controllers were supported just to use the haptic feedback to give a sensation of holding onto the safety bar for dear life ;) Will probably keep it around just to freak people out, but there just isn't the detail or quality here of other recent releases at a similar price."

,Not Recommended,520270,29646059,Posted: 2 February,all,fantastical,"I just wondering when there would be new updates.Not bad experience for Vive, but it is too short. Consider there is only 1 environment, should be more custom options.Not quite recommended until further updates."

Not worth anywhere near $5.Update; it looks like the creator reduced the price to $3 to try to sell more copies, but couldn't be bothered to change the misleading description or give any news updates to explain the complete lack of progress. $3 is still too much for this dead in the water demo."

,Recommended,520270,25606853,"Posted: 20 September, 2016",all,Scooter,"Good rollercoaster experience that gives you that special feeling in the stomach. The minus as of yet is that there's only 3 rollercoaster maps and they are quite similar, but the developer promises more content. I would definitvly say it's worth the money if they throw in more content. The graphics are nothing amazing, but gets the job done. If you like rollercoasters you will like this, and to be honest, there really isn't that many other good rollercoaster experiences for the VIVE yet."

,Not Recommended,520270,31029872,Posted: 8 April,all,LivingLitch,"If this were cheaper it would be worth it. Its 3 tracks that are a few minutes at best. If the devs add longer tracks Ill consider changing my rating. If you get it on sale it might be worth the buy. it is fun, just not worth the price."

Even if the lofty goal of many more tracks is never realized, the price is decent for a few minutes of thrills.(Regarding future tracks... I beg you... add more loops. More loops. MORE LOOPS!)"

,Recommended,520270,28607051,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,smartbombradio,"Should you buy this depends on your cash flow, really. It has three coasters, all three coasters are good, and fairly long, and the scenery is pretty good. A very real sense of falling/speed on some of the plunges, and really fun especially for VR noobies.However, I've ridden all the coasters and I've got .2 hours. Now I plan to ride them all again many more times but even that would be like 1 hour of play. Is 5 dollars worth it for an hour of virtual rollercoasters? To me it was but there are probably better ways to spend your VR dollars when this isn't on sale.So it's good and if you can throw 5 dollars at an hour, do so. I had a good time. If you can't wait for the dev to add a few more coasters, or wait to buy it at half price. I DO recomend the game, but if you're looking to stretch your VR dollar this isn't the place."

,Recommended,520270,25698693,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,[iP]Stave Darksabre,Deffinatly a fun game. As of writting this there were only 3 tracks and its deffinatly one of the better roler coaster experiences on VR that I have experienced. Yes its short and maybe a little too expensive (i dislike the trend to make vr games more expensive than normal games) but i'd still give it a possitive feedback.Itdeffinatly gives you a bit of motion sickness but if you have someone who is able to take your chair and attempt to move it in a fashion that is in keeping with the movements it most deffinatly aleviates alot of the issues (allowing your inner ear to match up with your other senses). If you want to show off your VR to people then this is deffinatly a good choice.Just remember this is a short experience so DON'T expect to be playing it regularly. but it is a fun experience.
