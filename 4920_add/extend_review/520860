,Recommended,520860,30249430,Posted: 28 February,all,Iyari,"Alright, alot of people seem to be saying this game is pay to play, which is in no way true. In fact, the ONLY things you have the OPTION of paying money for are premium(which doubles XP and money gain, which is common free game fare, and by no means required) and aesthetic items, currently colors and trails. Even without premium, it doesnt take all that long to get the money for things, a few matches, which if you do well, and the game lasts long enough(It's based off the points you get in a match) gives ~10~15k of the in game currency each, and that's without premium, which is plenty. Now, if you're not doing well enough, it can feel a bit like you're not making much, but... that's true regardless of if you paid for premium or not. not to mention you can log off for a while and come back to an idle game style money generator, which generates money even while offline till it hits 15k, at which point it stops until you collect it.It's an interesting concept you should try, the game's graphics are really good for a free, early access game, the controls are customizeable and handles rather smoothly. I'm honestly astounded that one person managed this much for an alpha release.Only downsides would be bugs, a wierd ""matchmaking"" system, the low player count(Though that may be an illusion caused by the matchmaking being wierd)Overall, it's a free game I recommend to anyone who wants to be part of an early access game that has a good bit of potential in my opinion."

76561198123243460,Recommended,520860,30172817,Posted: 25 February,all,xbaxsterxTwitch [Live},I love the game beautiful graphics and simple maps that make the game very fun. I also love the rate at which you earn money it doesn’t feel like a grind. Which is a problem in many games these days. The last thing that really popped out to me in the game is the base. I really like the base and bots sometimes come to attack you.Next i would like to say that I found out recently from reading another review that there is only one developer working on this game.Congrats you have made an awesome game!!Now i would like to say what I think should be improved in the gameFirst I would like to add more vehicles.Ability to expand and build in you base more (maybe customize the Terrain to an extent to have a cool base and have more buildings to unlock more vehicles)Add clans and clan basesFriend Window (i like to chat with friends and make new ones)What I found to be a deterrent to play the game was the physics of the game on the capture the flag map when you get launched fromt the ramp the landing made you slide right into the bottom of the cliff.I found one bug on the capture the flag map I forget what happen but I couldn’t fire for the rest of the game. Driving was fine though. Also is there a English Bug Report Page (sorry wish i knew russian).In the end great job I am loving the game and continue developing the game this game has a big future ahead of it Dmitry Medvedev.Edit: the bug on the capture the flag map is with the ramps. I lose the ablitily to shot when i hit the left pillar in the air. For the rest of the game

It's one of those games where even if you don't have as good of aim as everyone else or aren't as good at controlling the vehicles, you still get drawn back to the game time after time because of its enjoyable playstyle and immense landscapes to drive around in. Impulse of War has so many great opportunities in its vehicles, maps, gamemodes and more that keep me excited about its future and makes Impulse of War on the right track to becoming one of my favorite games."
,Recommended,520860,30149724,Posted: 24 February,all,Kodyd194,"Impulse of War, it seems like a pretty neat early access game. I know right now it runs pretty good, but I feel like it needs work in pretty much every other area.  I don't know what kind of player I would recommend it to at this point, but if you are interested you should check it out."
76561198077176170,Recommended,520860,30191520,Posted: 26 February,all,Metallocomotive,"(This is a pre-access title, so my opinion on the game may change as time goes on)THE GOOD STUFF1.  Two Vehicle Classes:  You've got the lightly armored, highly agile buggy.  And you've got the heavily armored, lumbering tank.  So simple varity.2.  The Gameplay:  So far, I've only seen Capture the Flag.  But I assume there will be more in the future.  The gameplay's pretty solid for a game that's 2 days old.3.  Wait times don't take longer than...  A half a minute.  So not too long.4.  The base generates currency even while you're offline.  You literally never have to play after the tutorial.  Just leave your base, come back, and collect the currency every day.  And you can have a tricked out ride in about a week!  Or you could play the game and get it in about...  No time flat.5.  It's Russian.  And I only put this reason so I don't go to Gulag.THE BAD STUFF1.  Early access:  Bound to be glitches.  None encountered but don't hold your breath.2. Special Ability takes too long to regen.  For the Buggy, it's a booster that literally just thrusts you up for about 8 seconds.  And then it takes 8 YEARS to regen.3.  In game payment.  Don't think this is a downside?  They said that in World of Warships, until the Tirpitz came out.  No, don't try and argue the point, it's a downside.4.  The sounds need a little work.  They aren't terrible, but they aren't great either.  The engine sounds like it's mumbling, even at full speed, and there's a lack of inertia when you go up a ramp, because the sound is so mediorcre.5.  Some of the effects seem a little unrealistic.  Like I imagined when I slammed into a rock that I'd be crush.  Nope, I ricocheted off of it and bounced about for a moment like a ball.However, despite everything I've said, I recommend supporting this game.  It's free, it's actually decent, and it's only a few days old.  Plus you get a bonus 1500 GC, (Premium Currency), for just downloading the game.  You have to go through the tutorial, of course.  But it's still worth it.  I think this game can me something really special.  Just add some more content, improve on some vehicle and landscape characteristics, and you've got a starter game bound to turn heads."

76561198361151700,Recommended,520860,30231338,Posted: 27 February,all,ThatGuysTooGood,"Even though I had some problems with the game it has a little potential. I cant say its a really good game but it was an ok game that I had some fun with. A couple problems I had with the game were that there were many cars or new weapons in the game. I know its only an early access game but 3 types of cars with 3 types of guns is not a lot to choose from. Another problem I had with the game was that the flying needs some work because while your in the air your car is very hard to control, your also not in the air for very long even with the longer flight and faster stamina for flying upgrade I still think the flying needs work. One of my other problems was that every time I got done with a match I would have to go back to my base (which I will talk about later) and rejoin another match. I thought that was kind of dumb that you could not just stay in the same match. My last problem was the glitches, you get glitches from early access games but this glitch or just problem with the game in general is where you could get stuck in almost anything. why I had a problem with this? People could get easy kills off of you. The things I did like though were the good ideas they had for this game. Its a good little time waster if your really feeling up to it and I liked the gameplay where you could fly or go under water. There is also a base for you when your not in a match where you can hang out and get supplie drops which I thought was a cool idea. I really liked the art of the game as well, it gave me sort of this rustic feel that I really liked. The controls were kind of iffy at times but I thought they were pretty decent. Overall I thought this game was pretty decent, free early access game and a fun sort of car shooter, I guess is what you would call it.I am going to give this game a 6 out of 10 and I will reccommend it, only, if your up for it :)"

,Not Recommended,520860,30232277,Posted: 27 February,all,Netrics,"Don't waste your time. Yes it free, and yes its very early in development. But there's already a cash shop in the game where you can buy currency in an alpha. There is also many other games in the driving vechicles shooter genre that are much more polished and enjoyable to play. Wait until the game is release before you try it.To be honest I don't hate it. It's decent work for just one person developing the game. It runs on Unity, and performes well enough. I just feel at it's current state it is not worth your time, unless you want to be a guinea pig."

,Not Recommended,520860,30234395,Posted: 27 February,all,KaynoMaybe,"This game seemed like it would be a cool fusion of robocraft and rocket league so I installed. It's free - why not. First launch and the tutorial crashes immediately, second launch we're good to go. Now we get to drive around a poorly designed map to shoot some crates and learn how to use WASD and the LMB. But let's go to our base. Turns out you can build. The facilities themsleves take about 10 second to actually be created, and being the stunning clever young man that I am, I drove right into the building spot before it finished and got stuck in the damn thing. How is that overlooked? Thoroughly underwhelmed, and for that reason... I uninstalled."

76561198103195708,Not Recommended,520860,30234489,Posted: 27 February,all,JarensGJ,"This game seemed like a pretty good idea. First off I couldn't get a good experience because of a few problems which seemed to be actually big problems. I wasn't able to put my headphones on because at 31% sound it sounded as if somebody in my living room could hear it through my headphones. It was extremely loud but I usually have that problem with a few steam games but easily could have just turned it down. Another problem was frames, I was so laggy. I tried turning my settings down 2 times but only thing that happened was the game stopped responding and it was a weird type of fullscreen to where I couldn't even start up task manager with Ctrl + Alt+ Del. I had to keep clicking to where it would allow me to click End Proccess to where my Windows would restart. I had to then restart up the game and wait 5 minutes in order for all the new settings to load in which were the lowest that seemed possible. They have a custom little Game Quality which you'd think they would use just low, medium, High but they didn't. I put it all the way at the bottom Simple and it was really laggy. I'd imagine if frames wise I'd be getting like 13 constantly. So i started moving around in this little car I started off with, it was weird and I even got stuck on a tree. I tried moving to the right but it seems like those car controls are the ones without right and left unless you are going fowards or backwards first. I also didn't see anything that told me about objectives except for the side of the screen it said ""go to the base"". I looked around and seen a big spaceship and a blue circle surrounding something. I tried to go towards the blue orb thing but my game suddenly just stopped responding and made my windows crash. I can run a lot of other games fine but you'd think that a Unity game like this which doesn't really look anything like these newer games would run smoother but nope."
