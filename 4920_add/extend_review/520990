I'm about 3 hrs into the game so far and it delivers on the same kind of tension the original did. The story is compelling and I would encourage anyone who is a fan of Matt Clark and Jonathan boakes games to give this one a shot. My only complaint is that I am currently unable to progress due to bug. I will amend this review once I finish the game."
,Not Recommended,520990,25773219,"Posted: 29 September, 2016",all,Cryowen,"To begin: I want to reccomend this game, I really REALLY do. I cannot, in good conscience, do that. PLEASE go play Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle instead. It's 10 years older, sure, but is a hugely better game. (It's done, for one thing.)I am deeply and personally disappointed in Dark Path as a sequel to Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle, which was the game that got me into point-click adventures and games in general. I ADORE Barrow Hill-- I recieved it for Christmas back in 2006-- and it shaped so much of my love for gaming. It's been released on Steam now, so it's much easier to come by.As for Dark Path itself, I guess I'm mostly bitter. I got it the day after release, and have waded through bugs and broken code for a week. Half a dozen re-starts, and being screwed over by unwarned sequence breaking AFTER the v1.01 update really took out most of my generosity for the flaws of this one. It's not as well-populated as its predecessor, uses poorly rendered and shaded digital character models in photos (as opposed to the real-life people you see in the previous game and even in this one), and beats the last game's excellent use of Celtic-flavored lore with the Wicca stick. The area to explore is so much smaller, there's almost nothing to interact with outside of puzzles, much of the voice acting is just poor, and it completely lacks the atmosphere and tension of Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle.As its own game, once the sequence bugs are fixed and we have an actual final product, it could be quite good. But, as a sequel to my favorite point-click horror game: Dismally disappointing. And that's the worst part.I'm holding out hope for Bracken Tor-- the sequel we were promised, and hopefully the one we deserve-- but I'm legitimately hurt that this was what we were given instead."

Expect awkward gameplay, goofy characters and really odd game design choices.The game tries to be different and seems to possess a kind of strange earnest charm that I admire though, so I can't hate it.Certainly not for everyone.

76561198093373295,Not Recommended,520990,25826822,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,Mrs. Nigel Danvers,"The game is a non-linear adventure in which you can explore every main geographic area from the get-go. Unlocking any additional spaces comes only with successful completion of particular story-line-advancing puzzles. Clues are placed to help you solve the puzzles, and in some cases multiple clues are offered. Clues can be in any form- advice from characters communicating with you, posters, radio advertisements, or just using plain logic. There is a mix of myth and real-life mystery spanning several generations. And as this is the anniversary of a tremendous, unexplained event that still haunts the survivors, the former event is used as a backbone to this story line.In theory.In reality, you are forced to follow a specific, linear, and undisclosed story path. If you don't, the relevant clues or world locations needed to advance won't appear and leave you wandering around unable to complete the game.One example:Game Character 1: Make the movie! Urgent!Me: Find all components. Make the movie.Game Character 2: Make the movie! Important!Me: Uh, dude. I did make the movie. Can't make it again.Game Character 3: Make the movie! I will give you vital piece of information you need to unlock the next part of the game when you do!Me: I made that movie! Now I get to wander aimlessly for hours because the vital piece of information will NOT be given to me since I made the movie the first time I was told, not the third time.Or, if you are lucky, you are able to complete the game if you try using process of elimination and guessing the correct combination of letters and/or numbers in the puzzle. Speaking of puzzles... some puzzles have clues in the form of flat out answers (password is literally located right next to where you need to key in the password). Some rely on logic or every-day items (That the weird cylindrical thing on the stove in the corner partially obscured by weeds is actually a bug zapper for when you need to zap a bug. You are welcome.). Some require a bit of ""research"" by reading articles, looking at photographs, and finding journals. But don't think you will get a journal of your own. You need good old fashioned real-life paper and pen to jot some notes down so there goes playing in the dark to get maximum scare benefit.Additionally, the characters are perpetually one act behind, offering story line, clues, and advice to moments that have already happened.Example 1:I find the clubhouse. I find the phone in the clubhouse. Character calls me on the very phone I found in clubhouse to tell me I need to find the clubhouse.Example 2:I find ""secret"" location A, interact with Character in location A, then Character calls me to tell me I next to need to find secret location A.Example 3:Interact with character. Interact with character a second time. Save character's life, get thanked by character. See character yet again and have a chat with Character. Character then calls me on phone and introduces himself to me because we haven't met yet.And when you aren't scratching your head wondering why the heck everyone lives in perpetual flash-back land, you are scratching your head because the continuity of the characters is really bad and you aren't quite sure who is who. Why exactly was in game video-chat Emma blonde but in-game everywhere else Emma dark-haired? Why were some scenes generated with real-life actors and some with not-at-all lifelike illustrations for the exact same character? And in Mia's case why was a whole second set of illustrations used? Because two fake Mias and one real actress Mia wasn't enough? Plus using the same voice actors for mulitple characters meant they had to play each character as stereotypes, and these were awful, plus every advertisement on the radio that you had to listen to because you had to get the clue. Ollie whined to the point that I didn't want to rescue him simply because I would have to hear him speak some more. Shut up Ollie. Just. Shut. Up.I have no idea why the original Barrow Hill was referenced so often. The only connection between the two story lines was the fact everyone kept whining that you fixed an entirely different problem ten years ago, so you have to fix this one, too. Most of the map was new. The evil demon beast of doom you must destroy to save all mankind was new. The type of myth that the game was based on was new. I mean, really, there was no tie-in.I dismissed mild annoyances like non-game killing bugs, weird disappearing inventory items that were red herrings anyway, typos, odd navigation, and the horrendous, epic DOOOONG piano slam every. single. time. you picked up an item. The first time it was jump-scare terrifying. The tenth time it was tedious. The hundredth time (because I had to restart the game due to bugs more than once) it was incredibly funny. I mean nothing on earth could be more dramatic and in need of an epic piano slam than a freshly made pot noodle, right?Would I recommend this game for purchase? No. It was relatively short. The story line weak. The acting sub-standard. If it was half the price and if you liked the genre I would certainly say go for it."

I enjoyed first part a lot, but unfortunately I can't recommend The Dark Path.No technological progress since 2006 ever: game still runs some low-res 4:3, seemingly using the same 10-year-old engine. More than half a minute intro sequence is unskippable; voice acting ofloooongphone calls is annoying; even v1.05 has a number ofcritical bugsthat made me force close the game via task manager and restart from an older save (needless to say how embarrassing it is to replay half an hour of such kind of gameplay).On the other hand it features some nice old-school graphics and puzzles are pretty logical.In a nutshell, for the price given the product quality is much lower than one could expect.

There was one Horror based cool game like this a year ago on Big Fish but that was it :(  So, when I saw this for sale, I got very excited! A horror based puzzle game with a cool story and super real graphics plus a little humor thrown in for good measure is my cup of tea. That is what you will get here. This game picks up after the first games incidents. If you havent yet played part one, go get it! It is also called Barrow Hill The Curse of the Sacred Circle. The story in both games involves an archaeological dig that has begun to excavate some stones near a town or place called Saint Awful (I believe). There are protesters against it who say that digging around in the stone hedge type area is bad and will cause soemthing terrible to occur....well, it does! This second part of the game, this one, expands on the story after the horrific nights events have unfolded years before in part one. So the game, the puzzles are great- from HOGs to more complex ones such as figuring out a code. This game and the first one are excellent and I hope the developer who I *think* worked alone on these great games will make more as two arent not enough! We need more of these point and click horror games in the HOG and point and click game category. Thanks for the fun :) 11/10  (wink)  for graphics, storyline, how well the game runs on my old laptop, and for humor and wonderful acting. Gtreat game.

As always, screenplay isn't the strongest point from these guys but it's left me itching to play another from the Boakes/Clarke collection.

So when The Dark Path suddenly appeared, I thought it was going to be much greater in length than Barrow Hill, with better puzzles and production values because of how long it took to be released. Instead, what I found were countless game-stopping bugs like invisible hotspots, missing objects and broken inventory puzzles. All this in what was being sold as a full game. Even now, after 6 or 7 updates, there are still glitches. It came to the point that I didn't know whether I was making a mistake in a puzzle or it was just another bug.The devs could have released the game at a later date, after they had time to test and polish it. Instead, it seems their main concern was to release it on the Autumn equinox.Apart from the bugs, the game has a few decent puzzles (when they work), but nothing to write home about. The atmosphere is somewhat creepy, but not as much as in the first game, the graphics are quite dated and the phone calls you get from the characters are more annoying than scary.Overall, the game just felt really shoddy, particularly when you consider how good and polished Curse of the Ancient Circle was. To say it's disappointing would be an understatement."

A few minor bugs are still obviously present, but I played through to the end with none of the severe issues reported by the earliest players.Compared to Barrow Hill, the game is much better in that this one is nowhere near as unplayable without a walkthrough.  The story is great, and the atmosphere is that ""can't get it anywhere else"" delight that makes some of us forgive the insane release habits.A few bizarre stylisitc choices do stand out in this one.  The game weirdy mixes human actors, with 2D sprites, with vintage 3D character models -- all representing the same cast of characters at different points in the story.  This is made all the more surreal by the fact that the various representations rarely so much as even resemble each other on extremely basic levels (like hair color).  This almost begs to be parodied, but, somehow, it basically all works and never gets confusing.All in all, a solid (if odd) game for veteran fans of the point & click adventure genre."

It's an improvement in most ways, only major detractor are the daz models I suppose. The puzzles were fair but some of the item usage had me utterly bewildered. The flow felt stymied compared to the first, which struck me as odd since when I (inevitably) had to google how to use some items most seemed to comment that the first game was harder.There's comments on bugs in the forum but they all seem cleared up at this point, I did not encounter a single problem in my playthrough. I applaud both the non-linearity of the game and the fact that it seems to play into the b-horror'esque nature of itself, but at times I feel like I should have brought a grater. Quite enjoyable."

The graphics are great for an indie game, a nice change from pixel-style games that are popular now. The puzzles can take some time to figure out but all the clues are there to help you.The use of sound in Barrow Hill is amazing- you can almost feel that there's a presence in the woods watching your every move.

,Recommended,520990,31811508,Posted: 17 May,all,Lincoln Balloon,"This is a niche game.  And I mean averyniche game.If you enjoyed the original Barrow Hill (which is also on Steam) and you're looking for more, The Dark Path has you covered.  If you've somehow stumbled on this game and are wondering what it's all about, maybe I can help.Barrow Hill: The Dark Path takes place 10 years after the events of the original Barrow Hill game.  You (as a nameless character) return to the old gas station/motel after all this time to find that it has fallen into disrepair.  Nature has slowly reclaimed the site, vines swinging over the old metal husks of buildings.  Your task is searching for a girl known as Mia, who has dabbled in occult rituals in order to find out what happened to her brother ten years prior.The Dark Path is a traditional point and click adventure game.  You collect objects, solve puzzles, and read notes to gleam information on the story.  The puzzles are very logical and well done, requiring you to use clues strewn throughout the environment to solve them.  There was only one puzzle I had major issues with, and that was the rearranging of the video clips.  I don't know why, but I just wasn't able to figure out the context for them.  In fact, I solved the puzzle mostly by accident.The game has a heavy atmosphere, thick with ominous music and creepy, creaking ambient sounds.  This isn't a traditional horror game in the sense that it's always trying to hit you with jumpscares.  It has more of a creepy haunted house kind of vibe.  But while the environment and the sounds are great, the voice acting and character models are another matter.  It quickly becomes clear that this is a low-budget game.  The voice acting is cheesy and the character animations are stiff and unnatural.  The acting was hammy in the first game, but it's more prevalent here, with long sections of dialogue that start to grate on your ears.All that being said, The Dark Path is a very servicable horror-themed point and click adventure.  I'd recommend it for fans of the point and click genre who like a tinge of horror in their games.  If you can get past some unintentional cheesiness and silly voice acting, you'll find a solid game underneath."

,Not Recommended,520990,25665395,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,CTRL+FU,"So, I've played this game for about an hour and I can say that it's horrible. Now, I don't know the publisher's or developers previous games, but it seems a lot of people that do have written positive reviews. Maybe I need to play some of their other games to like this, I don't know.I generally like point and click games, and I certainly like horror games. Which was the reason I picked this up hours after it came out. I even have two Win 95 computers I've built in the last two years with many of the old point and clicks I like.This game reminds me of a game straight out of 1996. A tiny window, static images of the screen you're looking at, horribly acted tiny video boxes, obtuse puzzles. I mean, I'm an hour in, with multiple items and I've barely gotten past the first few screens. I can't even figure out a way to get back to somewhere I think an item is used. It's like I just keep going in circles. When you move your cursor over the screen, you get arrows telling you where you can move. Some items you can pick up don't even have an icon saying to can grab/interact with them, so I feel like it's dumb luck that I've been able to get all the items I have.I'm not saying Telltale does it right by any stretch, (because they're such basic p&c's) but this game is absolutely the other end of the spectrum. It is one of the most frustrating games I've ever played, as opposed to something like Telltale makes, or something like Gone Home or Layers of Fear (for spooky/supposed spooky elements). Even most of my old Win 95 point & clicks are far better than this.So unless you're a fan of their other games (I don't know any other than the original Barrow Hill) or you like horribly obtuse point and clicks that you play in a tiny window, I'd definitely steer clear of this one. Get Gabriel Knight 1 or 2 if you want a good p&c horror game.I honestly would like to see more of the story and how the game turns out, but I doubt I'll ever play it again, so it was a waste of money. Don't waste yours too."

The story is very good and continues on from the original Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle game.  The graphics are superb and the environment for game play is well put together.This is a great game if you want to use your brain rather than just your trigger finger (much better than a just a 1st person shooter).  You'll interact with objects, people and 'spooky' events to find clues, read hints and background stories to help you.  It's a great feeling when you solve a puzzle and can move onto other elements of the game.  One of the best features of this type of genre is that game play is non linear, you can play in any order that you like as your own adventure unfolds.In addition to some very eerie and scary bits of the game, there's also some great light humour moments too.  The Barrow Hill Radio station not only gives the player some hints but also includes a range of great amusing radio adverts too.This game installed perfectly, runs really smoothly (in all screen resolutions) and has provided many hours of interesting and enjoyable game play.  As I write this review, I haven't finished the game yet but I'm getting closer to the end after solving some very satisfying elements of the game.All in all, a great game, an excellent price (very cheap for something that's taken a long time and lots of hard work to create), super graphics, great atmosphere, lots of scary moments and interesting adventure.Well done to Shadow Tor Studios.

It has a different feel to it, but it feels familiar as well. It had some issues upon launch, but when I reported them, the developer answered back that he was already fixing the issues people found. Wish more developers did that."

But it allows for research with fellow gamers outside of the game, which makes it kind of a community effort. I strangely like that.Such a treat to have this game released so close to halloween. Thanks to Jonathan Boakes for bringing us into his imagination once again; I love visiting <3Looking forward to Blackenrock!"
,Not Recommended,520990,25644707,"Posted: 22 September, 2016",all,d0x360,"The game runs in a tiny box regardless of resolution.  Im not a fan of the genre in general, i bought this by accident so dont take my review into account when buying but there seems to be a technical issue with the game.Since it runs in a window (set at fullscreen) everything is super small so I cant find objects as easy as i should.  Why doesnt it take up the whole screen?  Even at 1080p its only using about 1/4 of my total screen.I also dont care for the audio, the music got grating incredibly fast...I only played a few min and I didnt like it.  I also didnt like the main menu, the way it rotates is odd and unpleasant looking.  Lastly it takes forever to get into the game.  It hangs on the intro screens for far too long and then once you start there is an unskippable cutscene...i dont like cutscenes that cant be skipped even if i do want to watch them.  It ruins a second run through the game.Again dont take this review too seriously...this genre isnt for me but I wanted to leave a review due to the technical issues i came across in the short 6 min I played."
