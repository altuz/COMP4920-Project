,Not Recommended,521340,29626042,Posted: 1 February,all,Bodomi,"2 hours out of my total 2.4 hours spent in this game was AFKd for trading cards. I only spent 20 minutes actually playing the game.I mean... the whole game is in a the title, it's a game where you answer ~200 True or False questions.At first it was kinda fun but after about 50 questions I quit because the game started giving me terrible questions.10% of the questions just make no sense at all.10% of the questions willkindasurprise you in what the correct answer is.80% of the questions are painfully obviously true or false and will make you say to yourself ""what idiot wouldn't get this right?"".The game isn't that great as an educational game either as it doesn't tell you why you where correct or wrong, it doesn't give a background as to why your answer is correct or wrong.The game also has pretty bad English grammar.The grammar isn't only bad in the way that some words are written incorrectly, but entire sentences are structured wrongly or make no coherent sense.A lot offactsin this game are also just factually not... facts.Feels like it was made for an audience of 5 year old kids by a 15 year old."

,Recommended,521340,29808843,Posted: 9 February,all,Justice,"True or FalseSome very interestesting facts. The game is very enjoyable with a lot of facts and just to see how much you think you know about history and some other random facts.The interface of the game is very good, but there isn't reset button so if you got some of the achievement question wrong you have to go to your Regedit settings and make it 0 again which is very easy and there are guides to show to you if you are unsure.The soundtrack is very relaxing so you enjoy this game a lot if you are into these types of games.9/10"

76561198000861562,Recommended,521340,31123930,Posted: 13 April,all,Z0mBi3,"A casual and relaxing game where you guess the answers to questions. True or false is a simple game with little depth, but it can be something fun to do for a little while. The questions are for the most part silly and quite random and there's some humour to it. Some questions are a bit too easy though and feels like something everyone should know.It doesn't add much replay value since you already will recognize the questions. Some of them award you with achievements. The graphics are rather simple but it works well. I got the game in a bundle and payed very little for it so I feel like I got my money worth still.However, I don't think you should pay to much for this title since the concept is very basic and it's something you can easily find in free browser games. It's just a very simple game, but it works and runs okay and will be something to do for an hour or two, perhaps while browsing or doing something else."
,Recommended,521340,29636379,Posted: 1 February,all,XJ9,"Sooo, 200 questions for a dollar huh? Is it much? Nah not really.Pretty controversial+You have steam achievements for some of the questions guessed correct.+Steam cards to cover part of the price (cool badge)+Ambient music+free DLC with 50 more questionsOn the other side-3$ for 500 more questions-The game was completely free before.-Most of the *facts* are useless and randomBasically, it's up to you to decide, but since it's not a complete garbage, really cheap and with cards, it's a cheap +1 to your library"

I unlocked every possible achievement, and I can say honestly.This is an alright game, besides a few typos the games rather legit. Now, granted it could use a Buizel character in there somewhere, it was still really nice to play. Would I ever play this game again after seeing all of the questions nearly 18 times each? Not in this lifetime, nor the next. Keep in mind, that's with the dlc of 500 more questions. I mean, it's a free game, and some of these facts to you get to learning about are rather interesting. Good job dev's, I don't hate your game at all."

This doesn't make the game necessarily a bad one. Neither are the gramatics the most important part of the game, and it shows... but that also is not a reason to give the game a bad rep.The graphics are cute, well thats about all about the little graphic that exist. The sound is okay, not too enervating or too rousing, just something you can suffer for the length of the game. The game per se isn't long, it's played through very quickly and you might think, ""Well, this was it?"". Yes, it pretty much is... On the plus side the game is quite cheap...The game is not all bad, aimed for younger audiences, but lacking the long term motivation...
