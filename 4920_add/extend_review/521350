,Recommended,521350,32935514,Posted: 28 June,all,Myffafa | Twitch,"Very fun game, nice to be able to switch up the normal participation games with this one. I don't believe I've run into a repeat yet, so I feel that the prompts are pretty numerous, and they just added more. The game runs smoothly, and we always end up having a lot of fun!One suggestion to the dev team, if they read this, please add Twitch integration! The ability to require viewers to sign in would help immensely with the number of trolls that like to plague games. I end up switching games prematurely because of them."
,Recommended,521350,31307970,Posted: 22 April,all,Skadaboosh,Just played for 5 hours and it was the best fun I have ever had playing a game. Recommend to anyone with atleast 3 friends.
,Recommended,521350,31616797,Posted: 7 May,all,Wesker.,"This is going to be a honest review and will list all pros and cons.It's an survey like type of game where the best answers win, The house will try to trick you, picking those answers do have negative point deductions, but sometimes you're convinced to choose them, or it could be strategic instead of rewarding other players. The game is really fun when it's not competitive, but just pure humour, putting clever answers to win the audience is the key to win.Pros:~Only 1 person needs to purchase the game ($15.00-$20.00 bucks depending on where you purchase) - Up to 6 people can play, 1 hosts, 5 more join the game for free! All players will require to use a browser to type in joining code and to vote/type answers.~There is a choice to have a new person enter the game either as a new name or mask themselves as the previous person.~If you're not sure of what to choose as the answer, the house can create an answer for you, which if other's choose THAT answer, you get rewarded AND they get deducted points. If you choose a house answer that was just the house fake answer alone, You lose points.~Game is perfect for large groups of people, and also fun to play on skype, If you play on Twitch, remember usually there is a delay of 15 seconds (average) so players in the live game should be patient.Cons:~Currently there is no kick or vote kick button for this game, If someone drops, the host can clear the person from the game, and thus removing all their accumulated points, however that person can consistently re-join the game. This can be a nuiscience if you're a streamer and you allow people in the open public to join you. Best to play privately for majority case scenarios.~This being game that started on Kickstarter, at this moment, you may still come across some ""repeater"" questions, content may be limited if you play multiple times, I still find it enjoyable, but how far this game expanded to other companies, I'm still impressed. (Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, Steam, Roku, etc)~Timers cannot be customized at this time.~If relying on a host, all must be able to see the screen, may not be perfect when all on skype and the host/may disconnect, If the host disconnects, should be a warning or an opportunity for another player in the game to take over as host.Overall: I'm impressed and satisifed with this purchase. It is an excellent icebreaker for new friends and even better for close ones whether face to face or on any voice chat program;skype/discord/twitch/steam.I rate it: 9 out of 10!Would play again anytime, Only deduction is in hopes there will be future updates for additional content and settings. FYI: Steam may indicate I played little time, but only due to myself not hosting the game, rather joined an existing one, If you want a cheap game, this is a great way to break the silence and kill time!"

,Recommended,521350,30970303,Posted: 5 April,all,The-Uterus,"When you get this game, you're getting what's advertised: a hilarious party game that brings out the funniest in people. The rounds in each game are really creative, with the Sub-the-Title rounds really standing out. The only thing I was worried about before I started playing was that it'd seem a little too much like the Jackbox Party Pack games, but while it obviously takes a bit of inspiration from them, it never feels ripped off and actually does a great job doing its own thing. I can tell that the writers took a lot of time with the House Answers; my group actually ended up falling for the decoys a suprising amount of times because they were so funny.Bottom line, it's worth the $15 base price, and this'll make a great addition to your game night."
,Recommended,521350,31149579,Posted: 14 April,all,Corrin,"The game is almost entirely based on how funny you think you and your friends are. It's very on and off because of that. At the time of this review I've only played two rounds, but I have played a fair bit of quiplash, so I know the same applies here. Sure for ""Extra Extra"" the pictures can be funny on their own, but the main part of the game does rely on you being funny. If you enjoy inside jokes and jokes with barely any structure this game is gold, if not then you can still probably laugh at something in this if your friends are feeling funny that day. I recommend it, a workshop with packs would be really entertaining, where it lets you add clips, photos and phrases for each of the modes. If packs for workshop comes out along with dlc ones, then I'd probably give this a 10/10 since you'll find something great no matter what. For now I'd give it a 7/10 since it's so all over the place with how funny stuff can be, but rankings are usually weird, anything below 7/10 is considered total garbage, so don't take it as ""just passing."""

That's pretty much all it needs, really.This isn't quite as snappy as the Jackbox stuff, to which it invites an inevitable comparison by way of its similar control scheme (from mobile devices etc.) It is, however, novel, bringing a breath of fresh air instead of the usual 3 or 4 games you actually play from Jackbox (it's true, don't deny it).My recommendation: Buy it, unless you don't have any friends."

At first I doubted if this was for everyone, but the first playthrough all of my friends who participated got some points and enjoyed themselves. Even the ones that aren't the biggest jokesters scored once or twice. The coming weeks Use Your Words will be played a lot more.The different wordgames are nice, although I can imagine a bit more variety wouldn't hurt. I sure hope the developers are planning on adding extra minigames."
,Not Recommended,521350,33407368,Posted: 9 July,all,SJStark,"Just not quite up to par with the other options on the market. The pace of the game is quite slow. It does allow for some pretty good laughs, but becomes very repetitive and we ended up asking multiple times ""when does the round end?"""
,Recommended,521350,30991433,Posted: 6 April,all,Sandsh8rk,"I've been following this game ever since the Kickstarter for it was launched, and I have to say I am very impressed with it!Use Your Words is a party game similar to Jackbox, where people can join in using their phone or other web device, where the overall goal is to gain the most points by typing in your funniest responses to several minigames. Currently, Use Your Words works like this:Two Rounds of the following:Sub The Title: A clip from a foreign film plays, missing a subtitle. Users are to type their best 'caption' into the clip.Extra Extra: A random photo is shown, and users are prompted to come up with their funniest headline in relation to the photo.Blank-O-Matic: Similar to Quiplash, an open ended prompt is shown and users must fill in the blank with the funniest thing they can think of.Final Round:Survey Says: Users are given three Family Feud-esque questions to which they have to provide their best responses.Oh, and the whole time, you need to watch out for House Answers - choosing one of these will deduct points from your score!What I really enjoy about this game over its competitors is that it allows you to be a lot more open ended with your answers. Whilst Quiplash and Fibbage limit you to answer in the broad context of the prompt, Use Your Words' prompts allow for a lot more creative freedom, resulting in a lot more hilarity during the game. I especially enjoy the novelty of Sub The Title, there's something about adding your own caption to a foreign film clip that I find very amusing.The game can get a little bit repetitive, but there's enough content in each answer to last you a lifetime, and the devs do plan to add more minigames so I'm looking forward to that! It's perfect for parties and twitch streams, and it's only $15...JUST BUY IT ALREADY! 9/10"

76561198138440399,Recommended,521350,31667217,Posted: 10 May,all,ShieldsOverSwords,"Great game and extremely fun. i see alot of people complaining about house answers, but they actually add alot to the game. alot of them are actually really good and the deduction of points is only a problem if you are being hyper-competitive instead of just trying to have a fun time. they add variety and aren't predictable as to what one is the house answer most of the time (note, in many instances the house answers have quotation marks, which makes it very obvious in those instances). they add another joke to the mix and its normally a pretty good one too. i also enjoy the pacing of the game. parties aren't about doing as much as you can as quickly as you can, they're about hanging out and having fun. the explanations fo the minigames is helpful in case someone hasn't played in a while, is new, and to help get people in the right mindset for the game rather than jsut thrusting them into it suddenly. i can see an argument for a skip button, but i don't feel its necessary, the game is great as is and has given me no problems. i may not have played that much of it yet, but its a regular even anytime i go out with my friends. it is extremely fun and very much worth the $15 i paid, actually tends to be more fun than cards against humanity most of the time."
76561198074322997,Recommended,521350,31130091,Posted: 13 April,all,Cheeseboo,"As a fan of the Jackbox party games, I picked up Use Your Words on day 1.  So far, I've played several games with my kids and their friends (ages 10-12) with the family filter on.  It's a huge hit at our house.  My 12yo son loves the fill in the blank questions, my 10yo daughter is a fan of the movie subtitles, and my favorite is newspaper headlines, so every game has a little something for each of us.  I also like the addition of house answers which adds the strategy of trying to figure out which answer was written by the game designers and which was an especially clever moment from one of us.So far we haven't had any duplicates come up, but I imagine it'll just be a matter of time.  I hope that the game is popular and they continue to add more house answers, new questions, and maybe some new categories as DLC.  In the meantime, this'll be one of our ""go to"" activities for family time."

Fill in the blank is alright, and headlines can be funny. Looking forward to playing this with more people (we played with 4 last time and enjoyed it). Also looking forward to see if additional modes are added eventually.I hope more games like this start to appear as they are the best for mixed-group parties where there are people who aren't otherwise into video games (and an awesome alternative to Cards Against Humanity)."

For a little extra I can play the Jackbox party packs where I'll receive 5 full mini games to pick from instead of cycling through a good game (subtitle game), an ok game (headline game) and a dud (Fill in the blank game). It's a real shame because it does add some nice features, like an ability to funnel out nsfw questions/answers and the ability to kick disconnected players instantly.If more get's added to this or a way to play just the subtitle game becomes available, I may come back, but otherwise me and my friends were really disappointed and just cracked out Drawful and Fibbage instead."

,Not Recommended,521350,32707242,Posted: 23 June,all,dubs,"I played this game once all the way through so my opinion may not be as expierenced as others, but this game didn't seem fun. All of the answers weren't funny, and even the house decoys weren't even funny for me or the people around me. The thing about this game is that you have to be creative in a funny way, which is really hard to do because people like different types of commedy and being creative in the first place can be a hard task to do. (Also don't say the people I played with didn't like party games, because we played the Jackbox Party Pack for an hour after playing this and loved it.)Something to note- I did play this game on family friendly mode, because i was playing with a few people of mixed ages and because one of the answers on non-family friendly mode included ""Sparkling♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; with the squirt emojis, which I thought wasn't very funny at all.On the note of house decoys, I think that they are a flawed concept because it makes players pick answers to the propts that may not be the best, so if you do put in a really funny answer it may not get any votes because of suspicion. Also house answers do the same as the decoys, except there will always be a house answer, which makes this problem even worse.One more critisim I have for this game is the price. This game costs $15 normally and $7.50 during the steam summer sale. I think that $15 is a pretty steep price for this game. (If you compare it with the Jackbox Party Pack, their pack full of 5 games costs $10 more in normal price.)In conclusion, I would rather tell someone not to buy this game, because this game is dull and unfunny, at least to me and my group."
,Recommended,521350,30982553,Posted: 6 April,all,Neintendew,"The years of waiting finally paid off. It's a histerical game that can make even the unfunny people absolutely hilarious.It haves a family mode feature in case you want it PG, and a ""Let's Play"" mode for youtubers. It haves huge amount of content so you can play without seeing the same House answers or props repeated times often. Also, you don't need many controllers or PCs to play with friends, just phones, tablets, or anything with a browser.The only downside, which is actually one of it's strong points, is that you need from 3-6 people playing in the same room, for better game fludity and maximum laugh possibilities.I cried of laughter through the entire time I played this.

Other party games rely on fixed input (usually in the form of submitting cards) but this lets you use your devices to craft your own answers (if you choose not to use a premade one), and that makes this game rise above the others in my eyes.---EDIT: The latest update solved the original issue mentioned in my review. Original text is below.The latest update broke Sub The Title. The video constantly stops playback in the middle of the clip, and the parts of text overlap each other (or sometimes parts of the provided text get skipped over), leading players to wait until they see the answers on their devices to know what was submitted. It's still playable, but barely."

If boardgames like Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity were a snazzy 50's era game show.You'll need a tablet or smartphone device for every player but the creators have gone above and beyond to make it stable for a ton of platforms. We had 5 players in our game, two iPhones, two androids, and a discontinued Blackberry. They all connected and ran smoothly! We had two disconnects, one from a low battery and the other from an automatic lock screen so not the game's fault and every time the player was able to reconnect seamlessly.Tech jabber aside the questions are fun, the prompts are clever and if you need the house answer because you're not feeling clever in the moment the developers are evil jerks and have worked in house answers with bad spelling and grammer to throw you off (I may have selected three house answers in a row and I'm still bitter about it).Great ice breaker and party party game."

And while the ability to kick disconnected players is definitely a pro for this game, it doesn't make up for the fact that you can't choose the mini game you want to play, it got boring (for me at least) after two full play throughs although it may have been better with a full room, and three of the mini games (Sub the Title, Blank-o-Matic, and Survey) are pretty much Quiplash prompts.In my opinion, spend the extra money for one of the Jackbox Party Packs (I recommend Pack 3 at least until Pack 4 comes out)"
