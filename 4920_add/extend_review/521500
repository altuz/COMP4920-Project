76561198006413390,Recommended,521500,35343090,Posted: 30 September,all,woosk,"This 11th title of the Sakura series from Winged Cloud feature a trio of female bounty hunters Shika, Kotori and Nami who roam around the galaxy fulfilling contracts tracking down and capturing fugitives. One day, Shika came across a strange out-of-the-blue contract offering a massive one billion imperial dollars for the live capture and return of a fugitive by the name of Akane. Despite everyone's initial suspicions about the contract, Shika and her crew quickly decide to put all other contracts on hold to pursue this massive contract to track down and locate Akane. Over the course of this visual novel, Shika, Kotori and Nami will attempt to locate and subdue Akane, have fun with each other as well as to find out the truth behind the contract and Akane's origins.The story and plot is written like a comedic action thriller with a share of mystery, humour, romance, fanservice and has a nice happy ending as well as a short game summary with the number of correct answers at the end to reward players with several different detective ranks who read through the visual novel and make 21 correct/incorrect deduction and answer choices. The background music by REN from the circle 'Bastat tail', artwork by Inma and Fatelinealpha and overall presentation are great. Reading through the storyline and dialogue and unlocking all CGs at gallery will take less than 10 hours. Recommended when at discount or bundle offer for fans of Winged Cloud who might be interested in collecting the titles in the Sakura series, a short comedy thriller with yuri fanservice in a futuristic setting with appropriate background music and great artwork in the trading cards, badges, emoticons and profile artwork in this game."

If you like heavy fanservice and is already used to Winged Cloud, this game is for you. If you don’t, stay away to avoid problems.The art style is quite lovely. I found it hilarious that there are some action scenes that don’t even get a CG, but if a girl gets molested by another one, that gets a CG. lmao. But it’s ok, this is what this game is about: dem boobies…. IN SPACE!5/10, I actually liked the BGM too. I hope they’ll release a title called $akura Apocalypse or $akura Hell one day."

It has a very interactive story with some crime solving elements, great character development, great comedy, and yes; If you have the uncensored patch, there is some quality H-scenes as well. the music in this one is my favorite out of all the games. this game also has my favorite artist at winged cloud doing the illustrations, so the art in this game is also very well-done for what it is, a sakura game.if you get the ending where you get all of the crime-solving questions correct throughout the VN, its pretty worth itoverall, if you are buying this for the porn and want to support the winged cloud team, do it. but if you are looking for a SUPER SERIOUS DRAMA FILLED ROMANCE VISUAL NOVEL avoid all sakura games. these VNs are meant to be enjoyed and give a comedic feel like a rom/com ecchi anime, not taken as seriously as a Triple-A title."

While I am not expecting too much from a Sakura title, the writing and plot in this one was... abyssmal. Frankly, it did little even to connect scenes where the captain... shirks her duty with another buxom beauty. Or the bounty target...There is a patch that adds more... explicit content. Not sure if it does anything for the title at all..."

,Recommended,521500,32937454,Posted: 28 June,all,Starwolf-001,"Third of the Sakura Visual Novel games I have played. This visual novel was filled with beautiful art, some great characters and an interesting plot at first. Not the best visual novel that I have played but definitely worth getting if you are into the sort of imagery Sakura visual novels offer. ;)The score:Story 2/4Art 1.75/2Audio 1/1Mechanics 1.75/2Characters 0.75/1Total == 7.25/10.00The issues:- Previous versions of the visual novel had a Back button on the User Interface. This was missing on this version. However, you can mouse scroll to previous lines. However, this is never stated and new readers might be confused.- Branching paths == 0. This title has no changes to the story. Only ""Investigation"" points based on your choices when prompted.- A 100% score with the investigation points results in... no reward... Honestly, it does not make me want to replay the title. Feels very pointless.- All choices in this game at first felt like a facade. If you were wrong you simple rethink the option you make. I was testing to see what would happen. Didn't realise that there were ""Investigation"" points.- THIS IS SPACE! Ships, space and planets. All of these promote new environments... I feel cheated with how lazy this visual novel is. (Talked more in my conclusion)- Main character, Shika, has one of the worse thought processes later in the visual novel.- Predictable after your first encounter with the villian of this title.The Good! :D- Fantastic selection of audio/music for the settings and events during the visual novel. Best in the series so far in my opinion.- Art style is excellent for all characters and backgrounds.- ""Particular"" images show our beautiful characters in multiple forms of clothing and poses. As expected for a Sakura game.- Provided a few characters in this visual novel. Four of which we are really ""interested"" in. Although that includes the main character and she falls flat over time personally.- Great use of facial expressions.- The User Interface (UI) is absolutely wonderful! Excellent Graphical UI (GUI) layout. Smooth interface. Lots of save allocations (although not needed for this visual novel). Perfect for speed readers, slower paced readers and readers following the character's audio. However, it is missing the back button...Conclusion:I recommend the first title of the Sakura visual novels, being Sakura Spirit. This title did provide does still provide gorgeous anime girls in various poses and clothing with a story.This visual novel gets a positive review from myself as it presents everything you can ask for in a Sakura visual novel. A interesting story that grabs your attention. Characters that you may like or dislike. Beautiful backdrops and character art. A visual novel engine that work flawlessly and smoothly.However, as for my final and third Sakura visual novel... I'm not impressed with the series. The development cycle of these visual novels is roughly 7 to 8 times a year (Referenced from:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_Cloud). These guys at Winged Cloud have the resources and talent to make a great visual novel! Yet they decide to throw out these little packages all the time."

,Not Recommended,521500,29126172,Posted: 8 January,all,Darbee,"Length: Very Short (<2hrs)Type: Sci-fi Adventure/YuriAvg read: 2 - 3 hrsDescription: Captain Shika has seen all kinds of things in her adventures throughout the universe, and with her two loyal crew members by her side, she's managed to make a name for her small company of mercenaries. When Shika finds a bounty job offering an absurd amount of money, she doesn't hesitate to act: tracking hardened criminals is part of the job. Their target is an elusive mastermind, a mark who challenges their ingenuity at every turn.Overall: One of the worst sakura games out of the titles. The typesetting made this so hard to read for myself. The  R18 patch i'd say isn't worth adding as it makes the story even more stupid.3/10"

I just cant recomend it for reasons beyond that.The story is not that engaging even though it could have been.Characters have some good design but their stories are not that intresting or do they develop much.You got some sexy yuri moments but I wished we had some romance instead.The only reason I can find to recomend this is for the art which is more distinct from the rest of the Sakura game but that's it.I recomend playing Sakura Fantasy or Dungeon instead if you're intrested in a Sakura game with story and yuri.

,Recommended,521500,29348494,Posted: 18 January,all,Running-Target,"Sakura Space is an anime style Visual Novel. This story is an intestellar adventure story with an eroge ""Yuri"" harem.  I thought it had very good, understandable, funny and interesting story.  It has good artwork,  only english text and no voiceovers, music to mute.  It has a free hentai patch that you can find link to in forum.  It has cliche anime style characters and fanservice.   The UI is standard to the Sakura series VNs and easy to work with.  The protagonist is a female.  The female crew are bounty hunters and the villian is female.  There are no men shown in game.There are A or B decision points scattered through the game.  I ended up with 1 gallery picture missing, maybe there is a pattern of decisions to be made.  There are some scenes that you might wanna screenshot that are not in the picture gallery.  Nobody made a guide or discussed how to get all the gallery pics yet.  Does have steam trading cards and badge.  Hentai patch works, and Has some juicy Yuri action.CONS:This game don't have steam achievements, english voiceovers, sound effects or japanese voiceovers or kanji.Better to get this on deep sale or with the Sakura Bundle.  Or you could find complete gameplay of the censored version on youtube.  Might not be worth the full price by itself, as it is.For more info.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVIYfJ_-8HQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqjOssTx_3Mhttps://remyfool.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/sakura-space-visual-novel-review/http://operationrainfall.com/2016/09/28/review-sakura-space/https://gamesena.com/sakura-space-uncensored-game-free-download/http://www.ninja-blues.com/2017/01/02/indie-wonderland-sakura-space/"

,Recommended,521500,33472149,Posted: 11 July,all,Mooncubus,"Having played many of the Sakura games by Winged Cloud, I'd have to say this is one of their best ones yet.The story is pretty interesting and has a few twists and the setting is really cool, probably the coolest setting since Sakura Fantasy. All the characters are pretty likeable and Inma's artwork has definitely improved since previous games.The choices in this one don't really impact the story too much like in other games. Instead they add to an Investigation Score you get at the end of the game, which was pretty neat. I really hope to see a Sakura Space 2 sometime in the future as I really loved the setting.Btw, if you're a bit confused with the differences between Sakura Space and Sakura Nova, the two are not set in the same universe at all. Space is more scifi while Nova is more like a fantasy/scifi hybrid type thing. Also they have different artists. Space is Inma and Nova is Wanaca.P.S. If all you care about in these games is the lewd pics you should also pick up the patch."
