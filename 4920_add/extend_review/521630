,Not Recommended,521630,29952345,Posted: 15 February,all,Dozenbeer,"Clearly designed to only be played on a mobile device. Almost no gameplay or player involvement.Pros:+ the artwork looks nice+ game runs super smooth without any issues+ comicbook pages to unlock, that also look nice+ cheap price tagg+ you really wanna see how the frog evolvesCons:- very little to do, you only click left mousebutton to eat- basically just a wave-shooter- no strategy- you can rank up your stats with money, but it doesnt really matter- frog does only change appearance and doesnt get new powers, its the same gameplay throughout the entire game- a mobile-only port, since it has only options that would find a use on mobile devices- collecting coins feels awkward flailing your cursor around wildly.....- the music is generic and bland- very short game, no replay valueI was very disappointed by the game, as it didnt offer anything interesting whatsoever. Feels like a huge waste of time without having any fun."
,Recommended,521630,25697256,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,Erbkaiser,"Toadled is a clicker game with a 'Katamari Damacy' vibe. Gameplay is simple: eat everything on screen that is not a bomb, and use coins to upgrade stats as you go from form to form until eventually you eat everything.You can finish the game in half an hour or so if you upgrade smart and just keep clicking, but the game has a lot of achievements and optional challenges that expand the play time.What I liked:-The silly art style-The collectible comic-Ease of the gameplayWhat I didn't like:-The various 'avoider' things that keep getting away from the mouse and I basically could only eat with slow-mo-The overall look of the slowmo mode. The whole background etc. disappearsOverall a good game for the price. Definitely worth spending a few playthroughs in."

,Not Recommended,521630,27557688,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,Ucchedavāda,"Toadled is an incredible simple game, the only redeeming feature of which is the cute art-style.Briefly, Toadled places the player avatar in the middle of the screen while your mouse cursor takes the role of a cross-hair. Occasionally edible (animals, people, etc.) and inedible objects (bombs) will emerge from the edges of the screen, and you have to ""shoot"" the edible objects before they impact you, while avoiding shooting the inedible objects. Once you've hit enough edibles, your character grows and you progress to the next stage. In addition, coins continuously spew from the buttom of the screen, and you collect these by moving your cursor over them, which allows you to purchase various upgrades. Or to summarize, you are constantly moving your mouse around to hit coins while occasionally clicking on some, but not all, other sprites. This gets old after about 30 seconds, and the only positive is the fact that you unlock pages in a (short) comic while doing so. After about 30 minutes, you will, however, have unlocked all pages, after which the game can only offer you more of the same, dull, game-play.Unfortunately, even this simple game-play is not well thought out: As noted above, you have to hit edibles before they hit you. However, you are not placed in the center of the screen, but rather rather somewhat in the lower middle of the screen. This results in frequent deaths from objects arriving at a steep angle from the bottom of the screen: Due to the shorter distance between you and the edge of the screen, compared to other directions, you are only given you a split second to react (mashing space to engage ""slow-mo"") to many objects arriving from below.I would not recommend this game to anyone. My only reason for not refunding the game is the low price, the fact that I did play it through, and the fact that this would mean that I'd have to wait 2 hours for card drops (thanks, Valve!)."

You play through as a toad evolving by eating bugs, animals, people etc. The game itself is mildly challenging but not so much that it becomes too difficult, if anything it may be considered too easy. I managed to finish the main game within 30 minutes and fully unlock all the achievements (in game and on steam) within 2 hours. This is to be expected as the game cost no more than 50p when I bought it but I would have liked maybe a few hours more gameplay. I can't see myself realisically spending too much longer on this game, maybe an hour or two at most but it has fun graphics, a nice storyline, a very casual feel to it and for the price it is, I would definitly reccomend purchasing if you enjoy point and click style games."

The steam store page of the game is misleading about the nature of the game.Since i finished the game in 22 minutes and have no reasons to launch it again, i asked a refund.I'm not hating or anything, but i can't understand why this game have so many positive reviews, it has literaly 0 content.It could be developed by one man in one day and the hardest part would be the drawings ...Sorry, but i got disapointed.

It has plenty of charm through its art and music with simple premise: an innocent frog grows and mutates as he eats everything thrown at him. The whole experience definitely has a ""Katamari Demacy""/""Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack"" feel to it. The gameplay therefore, is straight-forward: You collect coins, you upgrade stats, and maybe try to rule the world in the process - You can even slow time in the process if everything flying at you just feels too overwhelming!It may be short, as I nearly 100% it in a few hours, but I don't consider that a bad thing, since I expected it to be short. In fact, despite its length, it's the best dollar I've ever spent on Steam (and believe me, I've spent a ton of dollars on wicked-cheap Steam games over the years). It's challenging without the frustration too.Add in trading cards, achievements, and even a little backstory in comic form, and overall, you've got the best bang for your buck in a casual Steam game.9/10 Tongue Lashings.

Made the collecting a little annoying in the end, where you have to get 750 Coins for one upgrade.I think it would be cool if you could regulate the volume of the musik/SFX instead of just having the choice to turn it off completely.

It completely gets rid of them and takes out one obnoxious threat from play- Protect the area directly beneath you, enemies will often sneak up and give you little time to eat them before you get hit.- Don't waste your coins on continues.- Use the slo-mo ability obsessively after stage 3, you'll find it essential for survival.That's it!
