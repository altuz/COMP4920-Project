,Recommended,521950,28114712,"Posted: 30 November, 2016",all,[PSG] Howie,"I loved the demo of Bullet Sorrow and was looking forward to the release. And so far, I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I was blown away from the game. At some point after the first level - which is basically the demo plus a boss fight - I thought that it might get repetitive. And then I encountered a stationary 50 cal with unlimited ammo which I had to grab with both hands and fire away at masses of enemies. I felt so goddamn bad♥♥♥♥♥in that moment.Basically this is Time Crisis in VR.So the core of the game is a solid akimbo style gunplay and teleportation movement. Hit detection is very accurate. You hold a standard gun in each hand and reload with the grip buttons. Iron sights work and are accurate as well, although in the heat of the battle you normally just spray bullets. So far I encountered uzi, shotgun and a grenade launcher as pickups, as well as a shield you can hold in the left hand. Pickups have limited ammo and when depleted, automatically revert to the standard handgun. Dodging and going into cover physically are an integral part of the game. I often found myself completely ducked behind cover and shooting bullets without looking.With the right thumb pad you can enable bullet time and that's where the game shines. Bullets whizz around in slow motion with a nice distortion effect. Bullet time runs out after a while, but is long enough to get you out of trouble.The AI is pretty dumb tho. They normally just go to their designated point and stand around shooting until you kill them. They rarely flank or cover. I'd like to see that improved.There are three levels so far, I died at the second one. First one is basically the demo, second one is a laboratory with lots of cover. Didn't play the third one so far. Took me about 30 minutes maybe and I think there was a bit of the second map ahead still, including a boss.In every map, you shoot a number of enemy waves which usually all come from the same door/spot. When all waves are dead, you shoot a big sign to advance to the next wave in another, new area. However, that makes it a little too easy since you can just rain bullets at the same spot all the time.(Played some more in the meantime, first level was about 15-20 minutes, I died at the endboss of the second level which took me another 23 minutes to get there. Third level still not unlocked for me).Graphics are nice, nothing to complain there. Definitely one of the nicer looking VR games.The only big downside is the audio lines. They are laughable and don't really make sense and often are gramatically incorrect. Instead of a chinese woman, better hire an english voice actor and have him proofread what he's supposed to say. That chinese lady just talks random sentences which don't make any sense.I don't know if there's a story. I think the chinese lady is supposed to tell what happened? You get put in the game and just start shooting right away, after a short tutorial.Oh, some ninja women ocassionally attack you with swords. Fortunately I had a shotgun and bullet time and 2 shots later her ragdoll flew across the room.There is no multiplayer yet but given the core gameplay, a multiplayer map would be pure chaotic fun. Devs hinted at a planned multiplayer part.TLDR:Get the game, it's great and one of the best shooters in VR.Pro:- Great immersion- Graphics- Akimbo style gunplay- Bullet time- Badass pickup weapons- 50 CAL stationary!!!!!!- Lots and lots of enemies to shootCons:- Stupid AI- Enemies all spawn at the same spot- HP aren't displayed except with a red border and heartbeat sounds- Voiceover is bad- No story?- Got a slight feeling of nausea, not sure if it was the fault of the game.Neutral:- Not that much enemy variation so far, mostly standard soldiers or shield guys, some ninja women- Some FPS slowdowns occassionally, especially from the sparks when shooting at enemies with shields (tried on an OC'd 1070 with 1.5 supersampling, so might be on my end)"
,Recommended,521950,28113779,"Posted: 30 November, 2016",all,XLSlippyBanana,"Ok. I had to turn off my Vive immediatly after Stage 1 to do a review. I was simply blown away!  Not only was the discounted price at launch perfectly priced but the developer had a great FREE preview demo before Early Access. Great JOB!  Every other developer should take notice on this strategy. Let your demo shape your development through feedback and a good price of your game to win sales!Now my review. The menu system is very basic and intro tutorial was fine.  After that, your straight into the game.  The action is fast. The controls are dead on and the feedback and hit detection was perfect. Not only did I feel like a badass in an action movie but I felt like I never wanted this game to end. The bullet time was perfect. I wish there was a indicator of health on your right hand, like a watch showing your health.  The action is like living a classic ""Call of Duty"" (the good ones) firefight.  There will be bullets all over the place and when you land a headshot, it feels great!  The first boss you meet, is EPIC.  I can't wait to see what else this adds to this game before completion to final product.  Support the developer and get this game now for your Vive Collection!  A+ Masterpiece!!!Oh yeah,  I can see a BULLET SORROW 2 in the future.  Keep in the great work... I will send more feedback in the forums."

Will buy again when this game is more optimized.AI is pretty dumb and is obviously scripted to go at specific spots. No mechanisms to prevent the player on using exploit (doesn't prevent you from going inside objects, walls, etc so you can cheese easily your way)"
,Not Recommended,521950,28124922,"Posted: 1 December, 2016",all,Scooter,"Great shooting/action game. The feeling of constant progress makes it a fresh breeze among all the wave shooters. Make no mistake though, it's kinda another wave shooter, but still you move forward almost instantly and in same map. The bullettime works great and at some points in the game you feel like a real action hero with blazing guns and shells dropping all around you. Weapons handle great, but I miss having to reload manually instead of just pushing a button.IMPORTANT:Movement system is teleporting, and to me that was minus. One of the maybe biggest drawbacks is that it's running poorly on my machine. My specs are i7 6700k, 980ti, 16gb ram, SSD so I meet the recommended specs. If I turn of reprojection there's some serious lag issues, and it doesn't manage 90fps at all. Because I meet the recommended specs, but it doesn't perform at 90 fps, I can not recommend it. Also the AI level of the enemies could definitivly been better, but gets the job done. No difficulty selection either.It's early access, so there's bound to be some features that could use improvement or are missing. All in all still a solid foundation with few bugs."

The first level is just the demo with a boss fight and it runs great, but level two gives me serious frame rate issues, to the point where turning my head gives me a headache. If that gets patched I'd say this might be the best shooter on vive I've played so far (And yes, I played serious sam). Love the game, can't wait for that patch."

,Recommended,521950,29493994,Posted: 25 January,all,Shadow,"https://youtu.be/YUNyFi1gI9kA game to potentially scratch that Time Crisis VR itch.I've heard people asking for a Time Crisis VR game and this really felt similar. Bullet Sorrow VR is a cover based arcade shooter with a voice acted story. It's somewhere between wave shooter and free roaming VR FPS but thoroughly enjoyable.You advance through a larger level section by section bound to a small play area. You can teleport around in this play area with a stamina meter on your left hand. Each section will have waves of enemies spawn and attack. Once each wave is defeated you move to the next section.I think the game would have been better served with a bit more free form locomotion. I don't really understand the decision to restrict movement. It ends up feeling like several mini wave shooter levels in one giant level.There are several different weapons you can pick up along the way that are purely temporary. You toss them aside when you run out of ammo. This can be disorienting at times especially with the rifle or shotgun. Some weapons have different angle orientation. You may be sniping head shots with the uzi, pop back to the pistol and you're now shooting 4 feed over enemy heads.Graphics didn't look too bad for a VR title. There will be people that complain about the aliasing. I've mentioned before that I don't think VR is in a state where that's a realistic expectation but I won't jump on that soapbox today. To my, the graphics were reasonable for something trying to be more on the realistic side of things.That being said.... I did feel like the sights were a bit difficult to aim down. The pistol model wasn't designed with VR graphic limitations in mind.As you can tell by the huge black bars, the game is an unreal title. I wish devs would focus on the Mirror window as it makes for a poor viewing experience in the current state.The game has 3 difficulty levels across 3 decently sized missions. I would expect 1-2+ hours play time depending on skill level/difficulty chosen.The gameplay itself was quite a bit of fun. Rereading what I have said thus far I may seem like I didn't enjoy the game. There are some issues and rough edges but I had quite a bit of fun with the core game and am interested in finding out the rest of the story.In the end Bullet Sorrow VR gets a thumbs up as a pretty decent cover based shooter."

I wish it was a longer game and had more enemy variety - but even saying that I still think this is one of my best purchases.  Its essentially VR Time Crisis - in every positive way imaginable :)  If you loved Time Crisis 2 in the arcades as much as I did, this will be sooooo your type of game ^^"
,Recommended,521950,29723258,Posted: 5 February,all,Handyfighter,"Pure arcade fun! I love dual-wielding pistols in vr and this game nails it. Imagine Time Crisis in vr with bullet time and bosses! The shotgun reload action is simply one of the most satisfying things you can experience in gaming. Honestly, try to resist quoting Arnie whilst using that pump-action in slo-mo, not possible. This feels a lot more like a full game as opposed to the 'wave' shooters. If I had one gripe it's that I would personally prefer locomotion to teleporting, but the movement is very smooth. Oh and that voice kind of creeps me out, 'I will guide you'. I just don't trust it, or completely understand it to be honest.Very easy to pick up and play, scratches that 'arcade shooter' itch.Devs are responsive and PVP is on the way too!"
76561198082959567,Recommended,521950,28128375,"Posted: 1 December, 2016",all,BurgerKrieg,"Action packed far east, near future shooter that improves on the flaky but still fun demo.Bullet Sorrow is like a great pop song, it's simple, a tad repetitive and incredibly catchy. If you only like deeply contemplative strategy or enjoy reading 400 page manuals please move along.This game is at heart an action arcade game. It plays alot like Time Crisis but with the addition of Matrix style bullet time. You are placed in a small area that is assaulted by enemies. You can teleport around (executed surprisingly well) picking up firearms and ducking behind cover. Hit the trackpad to trigger bullet time and then kill everyone while trying to look cool. Yep, just like an action hero. The next area is unlocked quickly and you move on through the map.It's a simple gameplay loop but it's very effective at delivering great VR action while making you feel you are the star of a John Woo movie, bullet casings pouring from your guns, sparks flying as you kneel on the ground guns akimbo lighting up enemy soldiers in slow motion, killing the last one just in time, before spitting out your tooth pick (optional).One of the main drawbacks here is that it's going to be a short ride with currently only 3 levels. There is little depth on offer so don't expect skill trees and weapon upgrades, this baby may as well take quarters it's so arcadey. I found some technical problems in the second level that may come from preformance issues with bullet time and heavy action, which is a shame but it's not a big problem and hopefully will get patched. If you can live with that and just want to cap fools and feel Chao Yun-cool doing it, this game is definatley worth picking up."

Feeling the recoil, hearing the bullet hit the enemy, enabling slow motion bullet time and dodging a shot as you grab a shotgun, pump it, turn and BOOM at the ninja who just dashed at you... its just freaking amazing.  My wife cant stop playing, and she isnt much of a gamer.I own over 40 Vive titles, and this is by far my favorite.  Just do yourself a favor, and buy it now."
,Recommended,521950,28251345,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,The NoobZMaster,"Bullet Sorrow VR (abbreviation not applicable! :D ) is a wonderful new venture into first-person shooter world the way FPS players wanted it for so long: you physically hold the gun, you physically dodge the bullets, you physically aim for the head and align sights of your gun, you take cover in a way that you know how. This game is one of the two yet available single-player campaigns on SteamVR, Raw Data being the second. The game takes basic arena shooter principle: enter the room, use the room's resources to defeat the enemy, proceed to the next room. At the completion of each arena, a shootable sign appears that, after being shot, traverses the player to the next arena/stage of combat. This way the game minimizes the need for artificial locomotion (for which you only have teleport on your left touchpad) and allows you to stock up/reload/heal up before venturing any further.Combat: AI is quite simple, enemies spawn from predefined hidden locations the player cannot traverse to (therefore denying player's ability to spawnkill them), however, after they've gotten to the point at which they engage the player, it's a s***storm of bullets and calls to ""drop your gun"", making you take a choice whether to teleport to the nearest cover or activate ""bullet time"" with your right touchpad and be like Neo from ""The Matrix"". Alternatively, there are explosive barrels in the level, allowing you to safely dispatch multiple hostiles when shot from within cover. The game also provides a melee enemy ""Assasin"" that is incredibly fast at lunging towards you and away from your line of fire, can kill you in 3-4 attacks with her swords, and requires a lot of lead in the face. Combined with hordes of typical military enemies who stand behind cover and their tactical shields and hose down their weapons at you, the ""Assasins"" are definitely providing a nice challenge.Here comes the complaint: why aren't the ""Assasins"" reacting to being shot? All other enemies take a moment to stagger when receiving a hit. :(Oh yeah, if you die - you're DEAD. Start the level from scratch. No autosaves or checkpoints.Weapons: by default, your pistols are always equipped, each having 25 rounds in a magazine. Reloading is done by pressing the ""grip"" buttons on Vive controllers (just squeezing the controllers in your hands). Across the level there will be additional ""power weapons"" that have only one magazine and upon depletion will immediately equip your pistols.I remember leaving a review on Bullet Sorrow VR Demo, saying that, due to the graininess of these first-gen VR displays, aligning fully-black iron sights is almost impossible against the dark camouflage of soldiers in poorly-lit rooms. I was, however, pleasantly surprised when I saw green tritium dots on my pistols in the current release. I would, however, prefer that those are added on all weapons, as this is a feature that is indeed necessary in VR shooters, but the pistol is indeed a great start.Map design: very linear, Half-Life-esque approach with corridors that have some crates and tables lying around for cover. Cover is positioned in areas where player can immediately teleport from any point within the arena, and the AI will come closer to the player if he hesitates to fire back, providing additional challenge. Quite sharp, beautiful world with hints and clues pointing to the backstory VikingVR is trying to provide us. As previously mentioned, there are explosive barrels in each level, giving the player an opportunity to dispatch multiple enemies at once or cause a diversion.What I find missing is the ability to fall back to the previous arena to get the powerups and health I didn't pick up before. This is to say, if the player is traversing one big room in 2-3 steps, then the teleportable surface should only expand towards the newly unlocked area, allowing the player to backtrack.Overall performance: with a GTX970, Normal graphics setting, there was no noticeable lag in the headset. Where lag WAS noticeable, however, is in the controllers. I've tried re-setting my room, re-positioning the base stations, overclock my GPU to get 10% extra performance - it seems to be rendering lag, because everything except the movement of my hands was buttersmooth (or maybe I just have no idea how reprojection and built-in lag compensation works).Jumping to High preset, however, often caused the framerates to dip below 90FPS and therefore the headset to limit it to the nearest VSync-able amount. Not recommended for GTX970 and below.Conclusion: it still needs a lot of work, obviously, but for what it is, it is a marvellous game. You should play it."

This is a fantastic shooter that breaks the monotonous Wave Shooter mechanic by cleverly breaking up the shooting segments into different scenes.  The action is non-stop.  There are no keys to look for, no hidden artifacts, just straight up John Woo-style shootem ups!Clear the room, move on.  Clear the room, move on.  Its a fast paced and brilliant arcade shooter.The Boss Battles are sheer delight!  Size doesnt matter if you are quick enough on the trigger.Movement is done with the Dash mechanic and the guns have an arcade-ey feel to them, but it fits in really well with the style of game (think Time Crisis).This game right here is the one I will use as a Demo to my friends.

So far it's an ok shooter, very reminiscent of time splitters and the like. The graphics are ok, although I wouldn't say they were great, and while it's similar in some elements to the likes of Raw Data it's not as good by a big margin. It's got a ways to go I would say, forgiveable for early access at the moment, but it definately needs to capture some elements of Raw Data as right now it's a light gun game not really a VR one."

,Not Recommended,521950,29274310,Posted: 15 January,all,Rafport,"I own this game from a long time, my name is somewhere among best scores in one of his levels. The overall rating is extremely positive (my old review it was) so a negative one can't be so bad for his reputation.I'm giving a bad review because with the latest updates, this game was quite ruined in my opinion. The good part was, like many reviews underlined, than Bullet Sorrow in some ways could be a sort of modern Time Crisis. A frantic arcade styled game, with tons of bullets, enemies and bosses. Good quality but not many contents, in fact many of us played this one at harder difficulty because it was seriously too short, with the dream of a ""real"" single player campaign few hours long one day.After a long time and I suppose an huge work, what happened is instead than Bullet Sorrow tried to add a multiplayer arena mode. Like the vast majority of such kind of games for VR except the couple of successful one like Onward or Pavlov, servers are empty and the game has tons of bugs. They removed also the dash teleport used from the day one, for a smooth locomotion, I suppose hoping in some additional success (not an option, teleportation is removed).It's hard for me to understand why a good game instead to finally reach the maturity in what did right, spend resources and time in something than is yet overused in VR. Today the game run slow (was faster before) and crash easily. The locomotion change is a kind of suicide. Maybe today's Bullet Sorrow it's better for someone, I can't say this, but for me they ruined a good arcade game. Very disappointed, I'm uninstalling it."

I enjoy the game enought that I don't consider it repetition.I'm an Oculus Touch / Room Scale user and the game works great and has continued to improve.  It reminds me a lot of Time Crisis (the stand up arcade game, which also did not have save points).Considering what is available for VR today, it is one of the few games (like Arizona Sunshine) that gets the FPS right.  It is still early access, so some bugs are expected, but I would say that none have taken away from what is a great game.  In fact, when I stop just to look around at the detail, they get it just right, not too much, not too little.I would put it in the list of my top 3 favorites right now for the Oculus Touch in terms of enjoyment from the moment the game starts until the moment you stop playing and  makes great use of room scale.OVERALL - A GREAT GAME!BTW - I would still enjoy it if it had save points, I know a lot of users are asking for it, however I personally think games like this are better without them..."

,Recommended,521950,28178823,"Posted: 4 December, 2016",all,Karnov,"As a VR Owner for a mere week I've been thoughly enjoying the small but extremely inventive library. Some games can unfornately be a bit of hassle in that they often lack basic tutorials requiring you to watch Youtube videos (like Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Handgrenades) and some just fall in the old fashioned AAA trope of being overtly long winded for no reason (Raw Data). [Note: I love both Raw Data and H3 they're just not perfect at their Early Access stage.]Bullet Sorrow does NOT put you through that and I'm thankful, instead of the developers making a grand VR Apartment for you to walk in and admire you're just given a basic menu and you can shoot the options. Is it glamorous or cool of course not but it gets the job done and doesn't waste your time. The game is quick to understand and I found myself comprehending the mechanics far before the AI Narrator told me about them. Think of it as a Light Gun Railshooter with some limited movement through teleporting.Now with that said this game will not win any fancy hipster awards, this game is very generic, it's not trying to communicate a emotional story or teach you an ethical lesson. But so what? You got guns, including an amusing Pump Action Shotgun that you HAVE to Pump and bullettime. What more do you need?I'm very certain this game takes its inspiration from Sega's Virtua Cop 3. And I loved playing that game. If you just want Arcade fun this is definitely one of the better choices.I would pair this game with a couple of beers and pizza. Sometimes you just want to stop thinking and unwind, this is a very good game for that. It's just straightforward and that's nice to have.

Here is my first 20 minutes VR gameplay of Bullet Sorrow:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3zuRm4mBw4Bullet Sorrow VR is a very intense and nice looking Arcade FPS Shooter in Virtual Reality, with full roomscale support, teleporting locomotion system and kind of a wave-based gameplay and with a storyline as well. Bullet Sorrow has some cool features lite Bullet Time, that gives you the ability to slow down the time in the middle of the action, something that reminds me of the old almighty Max Payne games. This game is still in Early Access, but already contains 3 different maps and probably a few hours of gameplay.Graphics are great, it gives me full immersion and the sound effects, soundtrack and voices fits this game perfectly. Weapon handling is kind of automated with automatic reloading, but all the cool weapons fells good and realistic. Bear in mind this is an Arcade-shooter, so it will never be fully ""realistic"" as it's not supposed to be that way either. I just wish they could add free trackpad movement, but Im sure this will be updated further on.- Well, Bullet Sorrow is just what I was expecting guys - and I like it a lot and I recommend it to you all - the gameplay video above says it all!I may update this review later on, when I have played further and when more content has been added.CheersSweViver"

If the Dev would contact me and insert my level /wave i got to id be happy as a fix i sent the log to them but im still salty!2) there is no multiplayer! it says so but it isnt, this games been out a while now yet they still havent sorted the maps out or servers, all are empty,3) the shootting sucks , its very arcade style if you looking for that game that gives you that satisfaction as your well places headshot takes its mark then this aint it.So that beeing said i still leave thumbs up because its bullet time is fun, graphics are good however it tears into your machine my GTX 1080 hits 81c when running this for a length of time. I think this game has pottential, i also think though that the longer the dev dont sort the multiplayer out the less people will be here for when its finally done. theres some really good boss fights that are pretty bad♥♥♥♥♥ guns are alot better than the demo version much more choice.Verdict: for £18 pounds this game will gives you a few hours of fun time, its nice to look at, controls are smooth and theres potential for mulitplayer to extend game time."

It has some incredible moments that make you feel like some kind of super badass when, say, using the Uzi with bullet-time or getting several headshots in a row.  The backgrounds, animations, models, etc are all well done and look good by the standards of modern gaming, let alone the regrettable low standards of VR gaming. The game does suffer from some Engrishy voice-overs, but its easy to ignore.Its one of the most fun experiences I've had in VR in a long time.  Perfect for showing your friends what VR is all about without having to give a lot of explanation. The game throws you into its world and the controls are very simple to figure out. The gunplay is very satisfying if you like arcadey shooters.There seems to be some confusion in these reviews. This game is not a wave shooter. It has long traversable maps. You do need to clear a room or  an area to keep moving, but that's a far cry from stationary wave shooters.Note: This game is Early Access and has a roadmap to include PvP soon. Currently, it is only single-player nor does it have save points, which means if you die you start at the beginning of chapter you played. It also seems to have some peformance issues on the higher graphics settings with my 970. 970 owners might want to try the lower graphic setting."

The levels progress nicely and hide the wave shooter feel that is often prevalant in the VR. It feels much more like a Sega Genisis era game where you beat all the guys one one screen and move onto the next. I think it works and I hope more people build games with this pattern.My Old Review:This game crashes everytime that I play it in a new way. It is solid fun when it is working but I cannot get through the first level without either a hard crash or a bug preventing one of the ai enemies from being within eyesight to be able to shoot and preventing me from moving to the next stage.

It nice that the game has grown beyond it's original concept. However the original missions are still it's strongest feature. There's an hour plus gameplay to complete all these missions.The zombie horde wave shooter arena looks very nice however the zombies AI is a little rough how they move around, get stuck and clip through each other and surroundings. In addition I had some odd tracking issues with my hands jittering in pointing in some directions (didn't appear to be the Vive tracker being the issue), and the teleport preventing moving to places that you should, however smooth trackpad locomotion wasn't affected. Overall I didn't find this section of the game that interesting. It also demonstrates the lack of animated impact when shooting enemy unless they die, this is throughout the game also but only becomes obvious shooting zombies as it's closer up, which takes some of the enjoyment out of shooting enemy.I can't really judge the multiplayer fully as I haven't found anybody online to so that feature is a bit redundant.This isn't a must have game, it's certainly better than a lot of trash VR out there, but this isn't perfect, has some good and not so good content which just wasn't worth including. I bought Bullet Sorrow when it came out and really enjoyed it. Now revisiting more recently and my perspective has altered somewhat and I'm less impressed with the game overall. Taking into account the cost of Bullet Sorrow I'm not recommending, it's priced too high when there are some quality issues with the game."

Multiplayer now supports free locomotion as well, however I have been unable to find a game with people in it to play with.The Locomotion is implemented identically to Onward's which is excellent.

Currently it only snaps a smaller amount (roughly around 15-30 degrees as far as I can tell)- HMD or Right hand Strafe OrientationThey of course should be optional, not default.I do also hope to see Free Locomotion integrated into the main campaign, hopefully the dev further develops in this direction and it will become an excellent VR title for all to enjoy.Previous Review below:-------------------------------------------Teleport only movement.No free trackpad/thumb stick locomotion.No Smooth Turning.Refund requested."

,Recommended,521950,29108217,Posted: 7 January,all,G-Dub,"I'm still working on completing this game, but I'm already willing to give it a thumbs up.This is a wave shooter in a sense, but you can also teleport around the room, take cover, and activate bullet time, so you really do feel like you are progressing through a game world. This game reminds me a lot of playing time crisis in the arcade when I was young, except with way more immersion.So far I'm pretty bad at this game, but I love playing it! It looks great (although admittedly not quite as amazing as the screenshots), and the gameplay feels good. There are only 3 levels, but they are pretty long and this is early access, more will be added later I'm sure, including multiplayer.The voice acting is a bit odd at times, but in a funny cheesy way. ""Obstercles eliminated"" lol.This game is fairly priced for what you get IMO, and a thrill to play. I'm looking forward to completing the 2nd and 3rd levels.If you got $20 to spare and want a fun bullet-time shooter, check this out!"

This is my 1st ever VR game review and a must have for your HTC Vive. Some say it’s a wave shooter, but I disagree... Okay, maybe like 25% wave shooter and 75% FPS.  Its easily one of the best games out there for the vive right now and a must if you are introducing VR to a FPS fan. My brother is a FPS fanatic and as soon as he tried this game, he went out and built a rig, bought a Vive and this game (He also put his PSVR back in its new box and stored it away so it won’t collect too much dust). Very well polished and pretty immersive. The bosses are kicka$$ and lots of fun. Do yourself a favor and get this game. My rig has no stuttering issues, but then in I'm slinging STRIX 1080’s. For those with 980's, do yourself a favor and upgrade.  As soon as I tried the demo, it was an instant buy. Good job and thumbs up to the devs."

It reminds me a lot of Time Crysis back in the old arcade days.  They've done a great job making this game accessible and fun.  Having bullet-time ads a subtle level of strategy to the game, which i appreciate.  it's not just stand there and shoot.  you also feel really bad♥♥♥♥♥when you hit bullet time, rush into a group of bad guys, and pop them all in the face while dodging their shots!it can be really difficult sometimes, and there's no save.  so, that can be pretty frustrating.  but i keep coming back.can't wait for pvp mode.  i recommend this game.  totally one of the best arcade style games out there."

The first level of the demo is a rather unadorned hallway, and no instructions are given on how to implement bullet time.I took a chance and bought the game because of the rave reviews.Now I understand.  The levels have an absolutely SEXY level of detail.  The combat is intense and very challenging, without being overwhelming like some other wave shooters.The movement is good and causes absolutely no motion sickness.The bullet time is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME, it makes you feel like you are in the Matrix.A superb game overall."
76561198024603195,Recommended,521950,31452877,Posted: 29 April,all,dosburritos,"This game is fun. The biggest flaw is that it needs more levels. Even with only 3 levels and a mediocre zombie wave mode I've spent 20 hours playing it so far, and I'm certain I'll play more. The devs mentioned that they intend to add trackpad locomotion, but even with teleportation it's fun. The bullet time works great, and feels awesome when you use it to dodge a flurry of bullets as you take out a swarm of guys yelling ""PUT DOWN YOUR GUN"" in super slow motion. The zombie mode is boring, and the pvp isn't really a thing despite it being an option, but it's still a fun game. It's not perfect by any means, but it's my favorite arcade style shooter available right now.I rate this game 3.5/5 crusty beans."
