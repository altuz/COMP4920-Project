A mash-up of the (jump) scary Brookhaven Experiement and the trigger happy Space Pirate Trainer.""Built from the ground up for VR""is commonly touted by developers to differentiate their games from others.  They may very well be built for VR but Blue Effect draws a sharp contrast between being bult for VR and beingdesignedfor VR.  Nearly every element/detail of the game feels intentional as though it was designed* to take advantage of and enhance the virtual environment.* Designed by people living in basements, attics, sewers, or under your bed who love reading Stephen King novels and drinking Nuka Cola laced with bath salts.Interface:Innovative and engaging presentation of in-game menu options that feels fresh AND intuitive.Environment:Eerie, spooky, and unnerving at times.  Great lighting, textures, and random clicking, thunking, and shambling sounds that build tension to the point of being disconcerting.  The environment itself feels like a silent yet malevolent character doing it's best to kill you.Gameplay:Alternates between frenetically fast paced firefights and periods of suspense building inactivity.  One moment you're firing wildly at mechanized metallic arachnid escapees from one of Bender's nightmares and the next you're firing wildy at shadows that may or may not  actually be trying to kill you.  But it's best to be sure and overkill is way better than under-dead.  The asymmetrical mutli-player is also quite engaging and will make you hate your friends.Music:Horror movie quality music that builds tension and alerts you to impending doom similar to the effect that the classical Jaws or Friday the 13th build up music has.  Sometimes the music slowly builds to a crescendo while nothing happens.  That the devs are employing this tactic as a form of psyops is a safe bet.  Sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (children of unwed parents)Effects:Polished and well executed.  Flashy enough to be noticed and appreciated but not enough to become a distraction.Blue Effect is what happens when developers pay attention to detail."

Its spooky and dark and has great creepy sounds.The critters are spooky and look great.The game plays great on a 980 ti 4790k 16gig system.All it is really missing is stuff going on outside the building in this first area you are in.I would add things crashing around maybe some fighting noise and lights from gunfire.Also would give more of a back story then just the guns/light...Something like ""you have hold out until we can get to you"" type deal.Then you would drop into your next area.The ui in the game is the best in any vr game so far.Options menu and all are just as you would think vr should be.This game should end up top of the shooters with some more content and back story.If they can make a bunch more creepy dark places to hide and defend this is going to be good lol."

Something like A Chair in the Room or Paranormal Activities, those are horror games. This is more similar to The Brookheaven Experiment but the fear is mostly derived from the dark settings, the atmospheric sound and visuals (which are top notch and some of the best lighting I've seen in VR so far) and the ease at which you can die. There's four primary levels to play though and each one has its own sort of gameplay focus on how you kill your enemies.Sadly, the game is a stand-your-ground style wave shooter than takes place in a 180 degree fight. While that is a bummer and I'd love to play more shooters that let you get out and move, the stationary aspect in this game adds to the fear. There is no running, you are stuck in this sucky place and you will die if you don't efficiently kill these enemies fast enough.4/5"

This game deserves your support. This is quality comparable to Space Pirate Trainer. Just like the shield in SPT, the light orbs add a new element to shooting. I'm constantly tossing orbs on the lookout for robots. When the waves get intense, it's hard to remeber to toss orbs and shoot at the same time. Often found my self just holding one above my head when they were close. Simplicity kept me engaged throughtout. Unlike Brookhaven, there is no downtime selecting weapons or buying bullets. I was never stuck in a menu I didn't want to be in, nothing but action. This will fit great in my VR Party playlist.Suggestions:* Make the player look up more* More locations, 4 or 5 good ones* Charge shot if you hold trigger* Really don't think that candles belong in the game. Think F.E.A.R.* Menu buttons should activate via trigger. Remove weird hand motions.* Refine the gun model. Sights are weird at best. Barrel angle feels wrong.* Make damn sure robots are fun to shoot. The problem with Brookhaven Experiment is that some enemies (e.g. spiders) bring the game way down."

I mean actually hiding, they scurry away from wherever i throw the ball, and sometimes seem to hide behind objects im staring at, and then scurry off when im not looking!The music adds to the tension nicely and the sound effects help ramp it up even more, its literally total darkness so the monsters growls are the only clue you have as to where to throw the ball.Its early days at the moment, 1 level, 1 gun, maybe 5/6 monsters so far, but hopefully theres more to come in the future (just make sure you shut your windows so the neighbours dont hear you screaming!)"

You are a mercenary standing alone in a broken down warehouse that is dark as the night and plagued with drones and robotic spider-like monsters. You see nothing yet but can hear the unmistakeable click-clack of robotic spider legs somewhere in the dark. You generate a blue orb and throw it to light up the area you hear the monster coming from, only to see its shadow pass by in a flash.

Luckily I was alone at home. It's also the first game ever(!) that made me close my eyes because at a certain point it was too much.  The concept with the blue ball is great and very well implemented. I just wish it wouldn't stop giving light so fast ;).  I also love the fact that the big spiders seem to wait in the dark, even when they're close to you, before they attack, as if they are waiting for the right moment..  scary as hell when you notice this by moving the flashlight of your gun.@devs:  excellent job guys!!

76561198116090688,Not Recommended,522020,31231145,Posted: 18 April,all,I am Hugh,"An excellent graphics demo and proof of concept in the form of a standard wave shooter, with a rail shooter option. Implementaion of the orb use in other wave shooters like ROM: Extraction, this quick graphics demo plays a like a high-powered resume for the devs, save for replayability and gameplay, which is essentially non-existent. If you are interested in a wave shooter with orb-throwing without story, ROM: Extraction is the obvious comparable title, whicj also brings to mind Raw Data, a real sci-fi wave shooter. But this graphics exhibition title offers much in optimization, lighting, and general ambience, though there is virually no sound design, music, weapon selection, story, enemy variance, or replayability. For many, the graphics alone will be worth the asking price, but for me, even a half-price sale is too much for what is at its total value, a graphics demo. Even the menu's primary interface is a credits list, and understandably so. I'm hoping the devs make a full game of this basic concept, or even just take this basic concept and make a simple game like ROM or perhaps a fun wave-shooter."

Sitting in the dark like that, with only tell tail signs thatsomethingis comingThe smaller enemies are easy to keep track of with the glowing red eyes. But the other one... Thats when you need to be awear of whats around you.Orb throwing is fun and fairly accurate. It goes where it needs to be, usually within less than a meter (3ft) which is good enough when you just need it to light up a small areaGun could use some settings to change the angle, but aside from that the no-reload really helps, and the fire rate balances it out.If you liked brookhaven, you will probably like this. They both bring different things to the table so you can own and play both quite freelyIf you are tight on cash concerned about price, hold off a little bit for a few updates to come. I expect the extra content will easily make it worth the $20"

Some differences-space is well used with barriers and cover for enemies created by crates, pipes and warehouse detritus. This slows their approach. Enemies don't just come at you like Brookhaven or HordeZ.-enemies approach in unique ways, the drones can fly over boxes and racks, the same thing the raptor creatures use for cover.-some enemies you can see the reds of their eyes, others are a lot harder to find. i found myself wildly spraying tracer fire when i knew there was raptor stalking closer out in the room somewhere.-sound used well, really raises the fear factor.

Awesome environment, very nice use of sound to build suspense, reactive and A+ quality environment.  Unique game play lets you light up an area by throwing a blue orb though there may be other purposes.   No teleportation (yet?) and only played survival so far. I had to die a few times to realize throwing the orb a lot is necessary to track your enemies before they catch you.  This could be the beginning of a great game.  I figured the menu out but suspect some will have difficulty.  In clicking around the menu, the game froze one time and I had to restart."

I jumped the gun and bought this without looking to much into it and as soon as I realized it was another wave shooter I regretted my decision to buy it.  It does have a creepy atmosphere and equally creepy music and overall the game is well polished for an early access game.  With so many wave shooters to choose from there isn't really much to be had here, especially with Serious Sam on the way.Update:  I have decided that my review came off a little more critical then I had meant it to.  Wave shooter or not this is a quality project that the creators obviously cared about making and isn't just a quick copy and paste cash grab.  I am personally bored with wave shooters, escape the room, and little party games because there doesn't seem to be much else, but just because other games exist in this genre doesn't make this any less on an enjoyable title..  This game stands out from other similar titles for a number of reasons and its honestly probably the first wave shooter worth investing in since Brookhaven or Space Pirate Trainer."

The content there is, is really good I just wish it just had a few more locations and variety of weapons beyond the pistol. Blue VR is wave based following the usual format of increasing difficulty as you progress. The game is made up of 4 game modes, which are different locations and pre-armed depending on the mode with either pistol and orb, duel weapons, or duel orbs.The use of lighting is superb it makes the enviroment one of the most real feeling VR games I've played, plus incredible tension as the enemy scuttle around in the darkness only to catch glimpses as you strain to see their location in the shadows while throwing light orbs trying to reveal them before they pounce. It's stellar stuff, incredible atmosphere.Blue Effect is worth playing, though you're not getting an awful lot of game for £10.99. This is one those VR games you add to your collection and play for 30 minutes, and find it's worth revisiting now and again for another 30 minute blast.

It's not the worst game in my library, not at all, but it's just not what it seemed from the other reviews.It's not scary, it's really not. The controls are quite horrible (Rift + Touch). It's actually quite boring and the only thing you do is shoot anything that comes towards you, or try to hit it with the orb/ball (which you can also use to block/kill the enemies and be almost invincible). You're stuck in your position, trying to survive waves, until there are too many enemies and you just die.Honestly, not at the level of Robo Recall / Raw Data or even just the static Space Pirate Trainer.. and the screenshots give the impression there's much more than what it actually is. Also, I kind of doubt all these reviews that contain the phrase ""this game is scary"" in the first line.The only moment of real fun I had, was when I threw the ball inside the basket, and an invisible crowd cheered and applauded me.

Please look at new locations even if in same scene, you have a great foundation, please build on it and expand.

Also the game idea with the ball you can shoot. But you waste all of it in a dark area. In times of Raw Data and Bullet Sorrow the extremly simple wave shooting is not enough - sorry."

Really creepy atmosphere and nicely done wave modes.The routine might catch up to you after playing it for a long time but still everytime I playit - I still get a bit scared now and then.Defenitely a thumbs up from me here.

That said, punching is really fun, though hard to gauge distances and tell when things are in range. Also, some ragdol physics to emphasize impact might be very satisfying :)The pacing is excellent, keeping you on you pumped with just enough respite to be able to prolong it, like a good DJ. Which reminds me that the music does a good job as well.The menu interface is really nicely done - way better than the usual point-laser-and-click UI that seems like a backwards effort to make a mouse in VR. Some things aren't quite there yet, I feel - distance from menu is sometimes an issue, different behaving buttons look the same, etc. - but overall, this looks like a good step in what VR UI should be like (I especially liked the little toggle mechanic with the pull and twist).And finally, it's nice to see a game made with small attention to detail and surprises, like the main menu buttons feeling like a drum kit (I bet that was intentional) and throwing a ball through the basket hoop play applause.I'm not sure how far down the rabbit hole goes in terms of gameplay (as I said, haven't played much yet), but I'd love to see co-op for this, and better 3D audio.Nice one, guys!"

Actally the first level in the warehouse is too terrifying for me :)This game somehow looks simple but when you play it everthing feels just right. A little bit like space pirate trainer (less action, more frightening of course).The next updates look very promising since they want to make every level with a different gameplay.

Tense action.Easy to hop in & enjoy quick play sessions.Audio - excellent use of audio, building tension. When the ""big monster incoming"" comes on it ratchets up tension.One of the more polished ""wave shooters"" (gads...uncertain if I should use that term, as it's very limiting & might have negative connotations with over-use).Great for demo'ing VR to friends.All of this & I've only played the main (1st/original?) environment.When I have time to play in VR, or am showing it off to friends/family, this title has risen to the top10 list of titles."

It's dark and immersive, so you'll find yourself hunting through the darkness for that hint of movement that might be an incoming enemy. The mechanics seem limited, though, so I've only had so much interest bringing me back to play again."
,Recommended,522020,29994280,Posted: 17 February,all,thefishstick,"Here is my first time gameplay video:https://youtu.be/2pu-3bhTAV4I had a lot of fun in this game. The pretty graphics, dark environment, and terrifying robot sounds add to the immersion. You can use blue stick things to giving you temporary blue night vision but I didn't like using it because it took away from the spookyness for me. I felt like I was shooting at 8 bit blue figures instead of the terrifying robots. I was thinking it might be better if instead of highlighting the bodies as it does maybe if it just made the skeletal structures of the robots glow blue.There are 4 levels to try out in single player; I go through all of them in my video and each has it's own challenge because you use a different preassigned setup of weapons in each. I haven't tried multiplayer but I plan on giving it a whirl soon.Again, I freaking loved the sounds in this game. They made it a keeper for me."

I could play if a few times in a row before wanting to swap out to another game... that said though I do keep coming back to this one. It's very well done, I only wish that after you complete x number of waves, you progress to another location for a change of scenary. Sadly this isn't the case, instead you have different game types in different locations. All of which are good fun."

Reason: It is perfectly simple: Easy game mechanics and no weapon switching or reloading (hell, reloading weapons in a computer game is like... crap). Still it is scary and the light effects are stunning.Of course it will not tie you to your PC for days like the Witcher III, so if you need something with a (possibly true) story, great charactes and a well sorted skill system, better search else were."
