,Not Recommended,522030,25540345,"Posted: 16 September, 2016",all,Propbuddha,"TL;DR - If you don't care about playing multiplayer, this is a decent adaption of a great strategy game and is recommended.  If you're interested in multiplayer, there's a lot of issues with the implementation that makes this difficult to recommend...Eclipse is a great light 4X game you can play in an hour.  I'm a big fan of the board game and of the iOS version thats been out for 3 years.  Glad to see this ported for a wider audience.  If you played the iOS version, little has improved and none of the awesome expansion content has been added (yet).I've seen a few bugs, most are minor or mis-interpretations of the board game rules only veterans will notice.  There is a bug in the current version that will result in the AI not completing its turn if you eliminate them from the game.  This is not a common event in Eclipse but you'll run into every once and a while.Everything looks great and this is one of the best board to video game translations out there. The UI is functional, but is very touch-centric (dragging and sliding things), which may get on your nerves.  The game takes it's time with animations which lose their luster after the 100th viewing, but because of the lack of a game log (more on that in a bit) speeding things up may make the game too difficult to follow.The AI is not too bad, but does some dumb things like falling into INF-Bankruptcy loops and failing to consider the Material you have in storage when attacking.  It runs a same-ish strategy every time, loading Dreadnoughts up with Plasma Missiles, even when you have counters.  The higher-level AI gets a stronger start, but isn't smarter.  Once you are experienced with the game, you'll have no problem beating the AI.So why a negative review for a game I like?The issue is with the multiplayer implementation, which seems appropriate for a simple mobile game (like Hero Academy or Words with Friends) but doesn't work for a 6-player 4X game.  I don't think much thought was put into the PC implementation nor what is best for a game like this.Eclipse is a game where you execute small parts of a larger plan with each action, making adjustments in response to your opponents' actions.  It's impossible to keep track of your strategy and what your opponents are doing when you have to wait hours or days between turns and the game offers no tools to help you out.  Where's the game log so I don't have to remember what the Planta player did 3 days ago or who took that tech I had my eye on?  This was a problem on iOS and is carried over to this version.The biggest sin is a lack of turn notifications (on Steam).  You simply cannot have an asynchronous multiplayer game without turn notifications.  Are we expected to log in every hour and check if it's our turn?Another big problem is the inability to set the turn timer to something less than one hour.  This ""feature"" was added in the latest patch, but the developer decided one hour would be the lowest setting.  The assumption is that everyone is playing on a mobile device (which is odd because this game doesn't support phones)  and doesn't mind long waits between turns.  Allowing a short turn time (5 minutes) would allow for people to indicate that they expect to play a game in one session.  Right now, the game doesn't even bother to tell the players how long they may have to wait for their next turn.There's lots of other missing basic ""quality of life"" multiplayer features...Lack of a game log in case you missed somethingWhy can't we skip though combats of other players (feature existed in old iOS version)You can't kick players out of your lobby that didn't ready up or are not onlineYou can change the player count or add AIs once you start the lobby.Can't rename your lobbiesNo chat in pre-game race selection screenNo message indicator or way to see main lobby or in-game chat without the window maximizedNo way to send private in-game messages to individual players in a gameCannot add AI players to a lobby... considering the long gap between the last iOS update and this version, I'm not confident these feature gaps will be resolved.They did add a feature to replace a player that doesn't take a turn for 3 days or quits with an AI, which is welcome.  I'm not sure it's working as I had a 2 player game where the other player quit and the game ended, declaring the current score leader as the winner.Will update this review as the game is updated..."

Even if you do really like eclipse, the board game is infinitely better, besides setup time. The only reliable way to play the game is to beat up AI, since online games are infrequently uncompletable due to very poor programming. The polish all around is extremely lacking, resulting in very bad AI designed for tablets and incredibly poor net play.I'll be certain not to purchase from these developers again."

But it's implimentation to PC (so far) is somewhat bad.  It's nearly impossible to think about your upcomming turn, because each time an AI or human takes it's turn, it makes it nearly impossible to look at your stats to plan.  So you have to twiddle your thumbs while everyone else goes, then, you have to start thinking about your turn only at the start of your turn.In addition, the options are bare bones at best.  Music is either on or off (with no volume control), and full screen are about the only two option there are.  Many more are badly needed.It's an ""ok"" adaptation for a very good board game, but I'm sad to give it thumbs down until more patches or update improve it."

Eclipse is one of my favorite boardgames and I was super excited to get it for PC.  However, there are so many mistakes and bugs in this implimentation that it's almost unplayable.  Planta are starting with a dreadnaught instead of an interceptor.  Missles guided by a gluon computer only hit on 4 when they should hit on 3.  There is no way to see what anyone else did on their last turn.  The AI (on strong) sucks badly enough that I can usually beat it anyway, but these are game breaking errors for a deep strategy game.  I wanted to play with remote friends, but it's just not ready.  I'll hang on for a while in hopes of further bug fixes, but since it looks like the last update was in September, I'm not holding my breath.  I wish I could rocomment this game, but it should still be in alpha."
,Recommended,522030,25534197,"Posted: 16 September, 2016",all,Fudce,"Bought this as I enjoy the tabletop game, and played a single game against the PC to see how it runs...Interface is clearly designed for tablets and ported to PC. Very simplistic and clunky, but it works.Gameplay is pretty standard, it's based on a boardgame, and it follows the boardgame rules, so that's what it's meant to do.Could do with a few graphical and UI updates, and I'm really missing the expansion races, but otherwise, not a bad adaption."
,Not Recommended,522030,31168895,Posted: 15 April,all,michiganwolverinefan13,So here's the basic summary. The single player version of this works great when you are playing against the AI. The problem starts when you begin online multi-player. The game constantly kicks you out and I have had games on several occasions where I will attempt to reload the game and it will no longer be on the list of games you are currently playing. This results in the game just freezing and eventually ending after several days for the other player.Overall: This game is quite fun but has major multiplayer issues that need addressed.

It even still has a highly annoying swipe interface to go to the next turn.Without the option to save your game, there's no continuing later or anything, you have to play 3 to 5+ hours non-stop like this is a 90's NES game.Absolute garbage for a pc game, and completely unacceptable."

As others have stated the UI is obviously ported from touch. That said, they did a good job using some hotkeys to make it less ""portish"". I've only played against the Peaceful (Easy) AI so far, and it is really bad. I'm hoping that the harder ones don't consistently make really bad decisions (choosing VPs over 11 power source on the first turn of the game, ignoring my fleet taking over their planets to attack the other player, etc.).I've only encountered one bug so far. As the Planta I was placing my second exploration and the tile disappeared.

76561198047212552,Not Recommended,522030,29949256,Posted: 15 February,all,SunMystic,"Disclaimer: I only played this vs. bots. The mechanics of the game is the same as the tabletop version. If you're going to be playing it hotseat or online, I guess it's... alright. Overall I was entertained if frustrated for the lost potential.As for the game against bots, I was sorely disappointed by the A.I. Perhaps it's a difficult game to make into a good computer-game, but the A.I. played after a strategy that was set in stone. This is absolutely unacceptable for a strategy game, as it essentially forced me to play in a cetain way every game. All the races seemed to play the same way as well, which is actually quite hilarious.The AI strategy, for every empire would, every game be:1. get double hulls.2. attack aliens first turn with the dreadnought they start with, and always win (I never saw them lose to neutrals, not even when they would...)3. take the middle.4. put missiles on every ship slot possible. Smart? Not so smart. My intercepters would often win against their dreadnoughts 1-on-1 for this.5. build monoliths in undefended systems reachable by me.It means that the replay value is zero for a game otherwise having a great replay value. If you can get rockets, winning is guaranteed. Oh, and did I mention the Hard A.I. is compensated for the lack of engineering hours by starting with a dreadnought? This further ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game, forcing you to play defensively until you've managed to scrape together enough research points for the one or two only technologies that will then instantly win you the game?""Small stuff""It has a few minor bugs as well and a horrendously poorly made battle design that left me thinking those epic interstellar ships were cardboard boxes, leaving me laughing, and not in a good way. The fighting is slow as well, and there's absolutely no options available to speed it up unless you want it to auto-resolve fights..."
76561197994127252,Not Recommended,522030,31168891,Posted: 15 April,all,loknar64,"While the game is mostly implemented correctly I can't recommend the video game version of this over the boardgame exception as a single player training tool to learn how the different alien races play. I've played multiple games online in real time while voice chatting with my friends and we've lost count of the number of times the game will locally desync. This leaves the players on the line unsure if their friend is just thinking critically about his next move, or unaware that it's even their move. The usual fix is that you can just close and reopen the game to rejoin the game session. However, twice now the game has kicked a player out after round 7 and they've been unable to see the private game listed in the game lobby. Obviously, whether a game can be completed or not is a huge turn off from even thinking about starting an online game.The other major weakness of the game as a whole is that the customization options include only turning Plasma Missiles on or off, and using manual or automatic combat. This means that the popular house rule to create the turn order based on the order of who Passed isn't included in the video game. But that's a general difference in video and board games, house rules and built in custom game options."

Unfortunately, the asynchronous multiplayer is really poor, missing basically all of the features one would expect from online board game play.  It is missing all of the following basic functions that one would expect from a good online board game:-Basic hosting features (like the ability to name your game, option for random race assignment, or the ability to kick players)-A game journal-Out of game method of notification when it is your turn (email or otherwise)-Any player profile metrics (play speed, games completed, win/loss, etc.)-No support for live gamesAdditionally, it seems to disconnect you from any/all of your games if you accidentally disconnect your profile on any of the devices onto which you've previously added it.  All of this adds up to a very slow and low-functioning asynchronus play experience; it seems impossible to finish a turn (much less a game).  Player profile metrics (with play speed and games completed, specifically) would go a long way towards resolving this, as players could set up games for other players that had a similar preferred schedule/pace.For the devs,thronemaster.net(for the Game of Thrones Board Game) is an excellent example of an implementation that allows for the creation of a solid online board gaming community."

I have tentative hope that Good Guy Dev will continue to add to and improve the game, and so I changed my ""Do not recommend"" to a ""Recommend."" This will be updated as necessary.Long version:I'm a big fan of the board game, and this has all the features of the base Eclipse: New Dawn for the Galaxy board game. It is pretty well programmed, as far as that goes. I have yet to find any game-breaking bugs at all---worst that's happened to me is that I didn't get the achievement for winning with a particular race, and the ""decision loop"" bugs, now mostly fixed, were fixable by exiting to the menu and then restarting. A rule or two seems mis-worded---for example, humans get three move activations split up among all their ships, not that three ships can move or move an extra hex---but this sort of thing is probably easily fixed once spotted, and so far the developer has been responsive.In any case, so far playing local and solo against the AI, I find it simply a faithful implementation of one of the great light/medium-weight 4X board games of the last ten years. It does, handily, add a ""no plasma missiles"" feature, and to its credit there are some very handy color-coded warnings displaying how many moves you can make before bankruptcy, as well as the likelihood of various kinds of planets or ancients, &c., among the remaining tiles. However, other than these valuable improvements, it is a by-the-numbers board game adaptation ...... for iOS. Reviewed as a Steam app, it lacks many quality-of-life features common to Steam's turn-based 4X games, if not computer games in general. A brief list of such improvements would be the following, just off the top of my head:There's no obvious way to skip the AI turn. As it stands, the dreadfully slow AI turns keeps you, in a 6-player game, making just one turn every minute or so. This may sound OK, except, by the design of the original board game, one turn means (usually) just one action.The dev apparently can't be convinced that this matters.[/b]""How else will you know what's going on?"" Well, once you learn the game and get good, you learn how much matters between turns.Neither can you plan ahead, because between turns, your opponents turns are visualized using the UI overlay you use to look at your stuff---and them doing their actions keeps you from looking at your own ships and technologies. Basically, you're stuck watching a visualization, or doing something else for a minute.The dev should also allow players to click for next turn instead of having to ""slide."" This is definitely an iOS feature which doesn't port well. (In general, any ""slide"" mechanic works better with a touch screen. Why do you have to drag technologies from one window to another? Why not just click? And, when the expansions come out and you have to select a row for Rare Technologies, after clicking you should just get a dialog box. There are already plenty of those for other decisions.)I turned on auto-combat, but, again, there's no obvious way to skip to the end of the visualization. It's nice, I guess, to see the ship combat Advance Wars-style, but even Advance Wars (for Game Boy Advance) let you turn that off.There should be tool-tips in addition to the slow-moving tutorial and the long ""text dump"" rules.There's no way to select random alien races for AI opponents.On a shallower note, the flavor text for player factions is not present from game selection. Sure, the humans are only cosmetically different, but the backstory behind those cosmetics was a nice touch from the board game. Sure, it isn't functional, strictly, but it'sfun.You can turn music and SFX on and off, but you can't make them louder or softer other than by adjusting your system sound. (This I personally don't mind so much.)Other players could probably come up with more, but these are the very simple things that will get in the way of enjoying this implementation of a great little game. Still, since originally writing the review, the developer has issued a significant patch which alleviates the AI slowdown, &c. I have tentative hope that Good Guy Dev will continue to add and improve the game, and so I changed my ""Do not recommend"" to a ""Recommend.""Other information:Wide-screen/windowed is a toggle---though you can't select a particular resolution for your widescreen monitor, it scales well and you can zoom in and out from the play area. No luck making icons larger or easier to see, &c., but I haven't found a need. Also, in windowed mode, it nicely resizes to whatever size you want it to be.Some points about the board game itself which does not have its origin with the developer's implementation:There are legitimate issues with the base board game, such as the plasma missles being somewhat OP, which makes the ""no plasma missles"" feature so welcome. Though the first Master of Orion is definitely a major inspiration for this board game, the enemy in the center of the board is no ""Master of Orion""-difficulty boss. Also, as a board game, the choices are not nearly as deep or detailed as you'd find even in a relatively light 4X computer game like Sid Meier's Civilization.The developer has confirmed that DLC will mirror existing expansions, and this is a welcome promise---yet, owning those expansions IRL, I can confirm that even when adding them Eclipse's relative simplicity doesn't ramp up all that much. The fun is in the psychological threat of warfare between real-life players, and in mitigating die rolls, and climbing up a simple technology tree as efficiently as possible, and in things of this kind, and there isn't allthatmuch depth. (That said, if you're frustrated and unable to get close to winning, I'd recommend the essay, ""Five Thousand Words about Eclipse."")One last thing: Being a board game implementation, there are wonderful run-throughs of how to play the game already on YouTube, and you can't go wrong with the video by the ""Rahdo"" channel titled, appropriately, ""Rahdo Runs Through Eclipse."" This will probably work if you find the tutorial difficult to understand. (This is not a comment against the in-game tutorial, mind, just that the significance of some icons might be obscure if you don't already know to look for them.)Is it worth your hard-earned $15? Probably not. Even with the issues I'd pick it up at $7 to $10. (Once expansions hit, I'd drop another $5 ea.)"

It takes some getting used to.Longer:So, I have been waiting for a way to play this game ever since I first came across the boardgame. I have so far only tried the single player version.The good:- It is a mostly faithful adaption of the board game's base game version- AI is competent enough to make for some interesting games, especially if you are still on the low or middle part of the learning curve- Graphics, Sound and overall quality are good to excellent for a two person development team.- for now the developers seem very responsive and fix bugs and issues quicklyThe bad:- some minor changes have been made from the board game (Race Selection happens before seeing the Tech board and seating order is then determined randomly; Influence Action works a bit differently, making some of the more common applications of it impossible) but they are easy to adapt to- so far no expansion material and no ""turn order variant""- occasionally buggy and with rare crashes (unverified: most should be fixed as of latest update)- UI is clunky and with bad transparency about what is going on at times making it somewhat cumbersome to have a full understanding of the current board state. However given the limited screen space and the abundance of information on the board, I would be hard pressed for ideas to do it better.- unless you are familiar with the board game and the rules the game has a steep learning curve that is very, very uncommon for computer games these days.Overall I am optimistic and hope that it is successful enough so that the developers will continue providing us with updates and expansion content."

UI is really hard to learn and it needs some time to get used to. There are propably a lot of things Developers can change in Ui which will decrease the entry level of this game.One of the key things about this game is that YOU NEED to play tutorial, otherwise it will be difficult to figure it all out by yourself.Aside of UI problems this is an adaptation of board 4X and it comes with all the sweet board game feel and playstyle. It's really complex and it gives you that satisfaction while playing.Huge THUMPS UP for that local and online multiplier, I will be returning to this game because of that :)"

Reminds me of another board game I played years ago with similar setup and strategy. So it's awesome to have a strategy game like this to play by myself and with friends.The technology aspect allows for an adaption of tactics as you go, and the different races give fun and distinct challenges/advantages. I know games are balanced for mechanics and strategy, but I wish you could skirmish a little more readily. Seems like it's difficult to utlize Interceptors and I disable the plasma missles everytime because whoever gets them first usually has superiorty the rest of the game. Still, a great game and I recommend it to anyone looking to test their strategy prowess. You might get a little frustrated at first but when your planning pays off it starts getting addicting."

The game is good to practice your action enonomy but for more experienced players the AI is hardly a challenge.Currently there is no notification when it is your turn in multiplayer. This and the possibility to set turn timers are desperately needed. I recommend the game for now as i have faith this will be implemented and then this will be a great computer version of Eclipse.
,Recommended,522030,25583185,"Posted: 18 September, 2016",all,Narkulus,"A great 4x board game, but this digital implementation is a little barebones. If you're familiar with the board game you'll probably have less of an issue with it, but it's just not new player friendly. The tutorial is okay, but the game has no tooltips once you leave the tutorial. Not having tooltips is bad enough, but then when you're not sure about an action and need some help, you have to actually leave your current game to get to the help menu. I hadn't played in quite a while so I downloaded the rulebook in pdf and alt-tabbed to it for reference. I don't understand why a simple f1 press couldn't have been implemented to have the rules pop-up in game.Multiplayer lacks turn timers and notifications which is something that definitly needs fixing; devs should take a look at Ticket to Ride to see how Multiplayer is done.I give it a recommendation based on the solid mechanics of the board game and am kind of hoping the game gets some much needed updates added in the near future. If it doesn't, I'll probably come back and switch the review to negative at a later date.Sadly, its got the iOS port blues. I curse you! Apple."

For fans of the boardgame at least, which I assume you're interested in if you're actually looking at this.  It's functional and the AI does pretty well.  There's some issues, such as having to slap the program a few times before the starred colonization spots will actually open after you get the technology, but overal it does the job.

We thought it would give us the chance to play the game as a PBEM over several weeks, rather than having to carve out the time from our busy lives to sit down and play it together in one go.Sadly, the platform as it stands is too unstable - and too unforgiving - to allow that to happen.The biggest problem is that, unlike (for example) Civ, where you can set a comfortable deadline to work within and a default number of missed turns which the computer will play for you if life takes over and you can't log-on in time, Eclipse sets a rigidly short time limit and automatically kicks you out if you fail to meet it.  To date, we have yet to finish a game with the same number of players that we started with, as half of us get kicked out for missing the deadline.I raised this with the Devs, but received no response.The last straw came when the platform kept dropping me offline for 2 days while I was in the middle of doing my turn - and then kicked me out of the game for not completing that turn!As it stands, this app is unplayable as a long-term PBEM, and if we actually have the time to sit down and play the game 'live', we'd much rather get together in the same room and play the boardgame."

Limited video and sound options (not even a sound slider for the short repeating track).    Iplay this on a 44"" 1080p television in the living room and I need to lean up in my chair to see the money + values.  No options to resize font.No keyboard shortcuts that I can find.  I use a Steam Controller, so it is easy to use just right pad as mouse, trigger for clicks, and that's about it.  Would be nice if I could map the buttons to view opponents, ships, etc.   Unless there's an option I am not seeing.VERY limited options.  Auto battle and the option to disable the OP missles.So many missed opportunities.  The missles could have been altered, maybe to just deal 1 hit instead of 2 (I believe the expansion resolves this issue).  No greater single player experience other than achievements.There are many more games space empire games on the PC that have much more content for the price.  Hopefully updates will improve options and content.*ahem* with that said, if you can get past all of that, its still one of my favorite euro games, and this port is addicting and fun to try out all the different factions.I may recommend this more for tablets than for PC, but recommended for those looking for a more calculating 4x management game."
