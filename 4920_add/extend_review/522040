While I enjoyed my time, I was ok that it was over and it didn't overstay its welcome. This title has very 'lite' elements ofPokemonand the bullet-hell genre. It never really gets that difficult, which was fine by me.Pros:+Price is right, although you can finish it under and hour (84% completion for me; while I may showcase it to other people, I have little reason to play again)+Controller support was alright (no real complaints, but sometimes it kept shooting 'down', but gameplay is forgiving enough)+Definately is its own thing, and brings if not something new to the table - a nice collection of previously established ideas+Music is greatCons:-Meh, other than your companion's powerup ability, the powerups in the chests are meaningless as far as any practicality goes-The storyline was skippable for me-Other than the boss battles, you could just brute force through the smaller onesTotally worth three bucks, and a small afternoon."

Have you ever looked in your mirror and thought, ""Wow, I'm hot stuff,"" and wanted to date an exact replica of yourself? Do you frequently like to flaunt that you are a ""Princess"" on your attire? Then Princess Remedy: In a Heap of Trouble may be for you!Princess Remedy: In a Heap of Trouble featuresYOU!The Princess of Saturn.Everyone in Heal Land gets sick and they need you, a student of the healing arts, to come treat them. Yet school has not only taught you how to heal, but also how to love, and the game features a dating mechanic wherein you can not only mend bodies, but also break hearts. You see, each individual you date gives you a special power, and you can date or dump anybody to give you certain advantages in battle. But, “Wait!” You say, “Isn’t this taking advantage of other people?” Who cares, you're the Princess of Saturn! You're the hottest stuff in the land!But not only are you charming, but so is the game! It features 8 beautiful bits of glory, complete with mock-NES music. The characters are diverse, and each has unique flavor text whenever you want to use them throughout the game. Furthermore, there are a number of Easter Eggs (during Christmas, no less!), such as the reappearance of a jealous chest and a super-secret mode that you'll have to google to find out. But anyway, I don't want to beat a dead horse because then you'd just have to heal it (and date it too). But this game is a great way to spend an afternoon, and worth every single one of the three dollars which you will spend on it.Download today!"

,Recommended,522040,32125761,Posted: 2 June,all,Love💋,"I was a person who was really charmed by the original Princess Remedy, which is free and a really cute and nice short game to play.  A bullet hell arena-shooter with very minimalistic gameplay that is nothing but adorable to me.This sequel basically gives you more of the same, however it does add a little mechanic that makes it a bit more interesting. Basically Remedy is once again ordered to ""heal"" the world and has to help people out by curing their illnesses. Goal is to save alot of people and upgrade your stats, like health, projectiles you shoot and their strenght. If you aren't helping people you explore the tiny world in search for chests, which also benefit you.The previously mentioned mechanic here is that from the beginning on you can have a companion you can date and switch around as much as you like throughout your journey. Depending on which partner you have, they give you different special abilities during battles. Homing Shots, Speedup, Healing, little Traps and so on, its pretty self explainatory. The game is very fun and battles later on can get quite difficult, which i liked quite a bunch. Never in my short gametime did i feel the game being boring and love its cute style.If you already liked the first, free game i can recommend this game just aswell. Its a nice extra addition, a quick game to play on the side and cheap aswell. But even if you didn't play the first game, i say give it a try!"

Once you heal someone you can have them partner up with you and they can give you a different speacial move then your normal bomb throw speacial. And boss battles at every heart gate.

Now you can!I really enjoyed ""Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt"", and got this game as soon as I could.For its price, I think it's worth it.The changes (gameplay-wise) from the prequel are~The abilities you gain by dating someone~You don't heal automatically; you have to shoot enemies which drains their health.~Area BossesOverall, it's a noticeable improvement, both in graphics and gameplay. The world is more animated and colourful, and the enemies and attack patterns are a lot more varied. The dialogue and sprites are charming like the prequel. The change in the way you heal makes it a tad harder, as you can't heal over time by by just dodging. I enjoyed the challenge. The game also a slightly longer, as it took me more than 2 hours to complete (I had beat the original in just an hour.)P.S. - If you a Touhou fan, you absolutely SHOULD get this one.

,Recommended,522040,25694462,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,Jakebob-Smegheneghan,"A prequel to A World of Hurt, this game's got more polish compared to the original game. The game's new selling point, along with the original's shooty-dodgy affair, is a buddy (or dating) system that allows you to bring most of anyone in the game you've healed along for a ride. Some'll heal you, some'll give homing shots, others will give lasers!The music's pretty decent, aiming to match the intentionally-retro graphics. Whether or not it's accurate is up for the Commodore enthusiasts to decide. Personally, I liked it.One of the things Ididn'tlike (and this is very much a minor thing) is that changing direction makes you change fire direction. This makes fighting the infections a little more difficult when dealing with chasers.However, the introduction of multiple boss fights is very much welcome. Whilst A World of Hurt had one big boss at the end of the game, A Heap of Trouble has many smaller bosses as gate-keepers, whose fights dip their grotesque feet into the stream of bullet hell. Coupled with three difficulty modes (as Remar is wont to do with games he helps develop), A Heap of Trouble is definitely worth the pocket-change asking price Ludosity have placed on the game."

I felt like my Xbox One controller's D-pad wasn't as responsive in this game as it was in the previous game, but it worked well enough overall.

You can get up close with the multi-spread to do damage or sneak in more healing while also risking your current health.

The game is relatively short but it has quite a bit of replay value if you want experience the game with all the different abilities, get the secret 102% completion rating, and see everyone's dances at the end. The gameplay is a sort of mix between a bullet hell game and a classic NES RPG game. The game works the difficulty up as you progress with challenging boss fights and more enemies in later healing modes. If you want a more challenging experience DEATH mode will definately supply it. There's honestly something here for everyone and it all coalesces into a short burst of fun that can be experienced over and over again. If you're at all a fan of bullet hell games and you want something that's an absolute blast to play through then purchase this game.

If you have some free time and 3 dollars and haven't played either of these games (this one and it's prequel which is free I might add) then suggest playing the first one and then buying this one. They're an odd experience that has lots of silly humor in it with a not so bad story delievers exactly about what you expect for a 3 dollar game.

A Heap of Trouble improves on the originals formula in basically every way imaginable, with the additional boss fights and customizable special attacks in particular adding a lot more variety to the encounters.It's on the short side though, only being an hour long or so for a single playthrough even if you're going for a completionist run, so be wary of that if you're looking for something a bit meatier."

It's a bit shorter, but there's multiple boss battles now and you now pick a dating partner to bring with you that changes how your flask button works. It's pretty neat. The graphics are just a bit more artistic with the two-color per tile segment artstyle, which is also nice. And there's some new bullet types that keep things interesting.On the downside, A Heap of Trouble feels a lot shorter, and now the shot powerups come specifically only from the bosses making it feel more like you're being gated rather than letting you explore and rewarding you for it. The dating system is interesting, but some flask types are definitely more useful than others. The writing also didn't feel as fun as the Wash-Olaf joke was omnipresent and run into the ground until it was fine specs of sand. And while the boss battles were interesting, there wasn't as much exploration with the normal battle enemy types and it just felt like there should've been more fights to really get some interesting stuff like A World of Hurt did.My final thought is that overall A Heap of Trouble has the quality of a free game while A World of Hurt is worth the $3. The gameplay is just as fun though, so if you enjoyed A World of Hurt you definitely should pick up A Heap of Trouble."

The normal difficulty mode is just challenging enough to keep players interested but not so challenging that it would scare away casual gamers. The other two difficulty modes are quite fun and hard as heck, but still achievable.I beat the game 102% on hard mode after a play-through on normal mode. The difference in the difficulties is clever, it doesn't make it harder by just putting more enemies on the map or making their shots stronger. It changes aspects of each enemy or boss and adds different types of projectile to dodge.This game is very funny and made me want to keep playing because I wanted to read the next textbox. The story is very plain and simple, but it is easily overshadowed by the game play and characters.I highly recommend this game and if you don't want to spend any money, get the first game. It is free."

Even better:these special attacks are interchangable!While those were nice changes to experience in this retro-like bullet hell, I still have a minor problem with this game: It's really short (20-30 minutes on average per run) just like the first one, and the storyline pretty much mimics the first one: that is, you have tokill a humongous beast made of all the horrifying and problematic troubles in order to save the world, and thenchoose someone to end your game with. I personally wish the storyline would have gone a bit differently...All things considered, I recommend this game, but I would highly suggest waiting for a sale."

The aesthetic of the game is strange yet familiar! The characters you end up healing in this game all have hilarious dialogue which mean the team must have had fun coming up with this stuff.

You run around, shoot at all the viruses until they die, and then the person is healed!What's Different About This Game as Compared to the First?I'm very glad you asked! There is much more land and people to cover, multiple bosses as opposed to just one, and the new dating mechanic, in which you can date and be accompanied by anybody you heal. When you have a special someone following you around, they will give you certain advantages in healing mode. (i.e. Dating Frallan will give you a ""healing"" move that will heal up a little bit of health.)Is This Game Better Than the First?Well, that's a difficult question. In my personal opinion, I think I liked the first game better just because it WAS the first game. Experiencing something as fresh and wonderful as the Princess Remedy franchise for the first time was an amazing experience, and I don't think I'll ever forget those first few moments of wonder. And don't get me wrong, the content and aesthetics of this game are better. I just prefer the first game.Should I Get This Game?Play the first game first (if you haven't already), then play this one! It's a fantastic game and is filled with all sorts of humorous bits of dialogue and characters.Overall, 9.5/10The only reason I didn't give it a 10/10 is because it's so short.

The gameplay and graphics are tighter and the ""dating"" powerup system adds a surprising amount of depth. The sense of artistic design in these games is really something splendid to behold--there's so much beauty packed into these simple, pre-PC style pixels, and as in the first, a satisfying story resolution. Apparently this didn't sell super well, so they aren't sure when or if they're making a sequel, but I hope more people will pick up on this gem... after all, that 3 bucks for a breezy game with replay value is money easily given and well spent."
