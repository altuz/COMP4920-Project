,Recommended,522210,33560041,Posted: 15 July,all,SaltTM,"Update 2: Dev's addressed and 'fixed' the loading issue people were having on the same day as release. It was connected to the real world data service, for those who won't get to experience this feature because of that bug: Basically based on the time of day the game would change the day in game so at night it would be dark, or during the evening it would be dim or during the day it would be fully lit like normal. It's a very cool feel to the game when I played it at night and in the morning.Update: I don't get the loading bug other reviewers are reporting on, so don't take those reviews as a means to skip this game because I finished the main story without any problems.Great game, great level design, great music. Story was interesting, didn't know what I was expecting the whole way through. The challenges were challenging, had me yelling at the screen a few times, but it was great.Game length is about 5 hours, then again some levels took some time to think and some levels had to be restarted few times.Forgot one note, items in the level are randomly generated. So if you get a bad level you can restart from the menu and they might move a body to a better spot than previously if you're having trouble with some levels.I rate this game 5/5, was exactly what I expected and more."

Basic mechanics are patrolling enemies with fixed patters and 'vision cones' plus some reaction to sounds and environment. Enemies are relentless and getting hit once means restarting the level.- This is balanced by ridiculously cheaty 'hiding' system - you jump into a dumpster in plain view of three cops and they all go 'Huh, guess he beat us here, let's go back to stations'.- The way storyline is presented (kinda) copies Hotline Miami 'back at your place' intermissions without being so laconic, forceful and remorseless. I guess this is more 'neutral' than downside.Good stuff:- Well, duh, artwork is nice, and the sounds don't make you want to turn them off immediately.- Missions are pretty short and actually require some planning- You can leave the game for a year and come back w/o needing to relearn metric ♥♥♥♥♥on of controls and mechanics.My TL;DR would be, get this on sale and treat this lightly. This is the game to enjoyably kill half an hour here and there and then forget about the whole experience."
76561198059342678,Recommended,522210,33584119,Posted: 16 July,all,Jake Mistake,"For a video review, tune into the video below:https://youtu.be/GQAQM8M83MEOtherwise, here’s a write up.StoryIn this game you play as Bob, a freelance cleaner hired to get rid of bodies and evidence. Most of the story is delivered in your house, which is the only other place you’ll be in besides mission areas. You’ll always return back to the house prior to any contract and during that time you can interact with things like the TV, newspaper, and radio to hear the news that either foreshadowing your next contract or reacting to your previous one.Most of the initial contracts are self-contained events but towards the halfway point a common thread will start to link the jobs together. Plot wise, it’s straightforward and easy to follow, similar to Bob himself. He gets a little bit of depth in how he reacts to certain events but the game’s not trying to make him an incredibly layered character.Instead, he’s mostly a mildly sarcastic person that makes as many puns and pop culture references as he does regular dialogue. Overall, it’s a simple story that suits the setting, but you shouldn’t expect anything profound here.GameplaySerial cleaner is a fast-paced 2D stealth action game. Your main job is to dispose of any bodies and evidence lying around and sometimes you’ll even need to vacuum up the bloodstains. Besides using your vacuum, you can only walk around the area an interact with a select few objects and you’ll have to complete the level without getting caught be the police. Cops will give chase if they spot you in their cone vision and they can also be alerted if they happen to hear you (something to keep in mind is how you make more noise while carrying a body or when you’re using the vacuum cleaner).Since you can’t outrun most of them, your only hope is to get to a hiding spot (one of the level’s items that can be interacted with) before they catch you. You can definitely exploit this mechanic since hiding in front of your pursuer doesn’t blow your cover but this is counterbalanced by the fact that the game later on introduces faster enemies, not to mention that a hiding spot isn’t always going to be where you need it.Progression wise, the game’s 20 story contracts introduce new enemies and mechanics every 2-3 levels. You’ll eventually get to move items to make new paths, make loud diversions using items on the map, and even access shortcuts in the area, all of which are crucial as the game ramps up in scale and complexity. You can keep track of them by using the Cleaner vision which essentially zooms out of the map to show you all the important items.Enemies in turn include stationary foes that signal a group of cops to your last known position, faster grunts and guards that will shoot you on sight. Variety aside, one of the good things SC has is decent AI. While cops do have their initial patrol patterns, they’ll immediately change them to investigate any missing body or pieces of evidence. This is also the case when you move objects to block their path so it’s not as simple as just memorizing all their patrol routes since there is quite abit of variation to take into account.The game is fast-paced in that you need to act quick when you’ve been spotted but it also rewards patience. Taking things slower is key to understanding enemy behavior and the levels themselves since each portion of the area normally has at least 2 entry points, so you’re not getting shoehorned into any particular path.For replay value, you have 2 options. You can complete bonus contracts (10 in total), provided you unlock them by finding special items in the story levels, or you can undergo challenge mode which allows you to play all previous levels with unique restrictions. These include things like disabling cleaner vision and completing the level without ever being spotted.Take that into account with the nice amount of progression, the emphasis on player choice through level design and the competent AI and SK is an enjoyable experience with quite abit of longevity.Pros1) Great visuals but even better audio – if you’re a fan of 70s rock and jazz, I’d recommend getting the soundtrack bundle2) Competent AI3) Good amount of progression and replay value – keeps things from getting staleCons1) Not much of a plot"
,Recommended,522210,33613615,Posted: 17 July,all,H.I. McDunnough,"Serial Cleaner is super fun. A perfect little stealth game. It reminds me of a more chill ""Hotline Miami"" in gameplay. Created with a 70's aesthetic it has a sweet period soundtrack and really crisp pastel visuals. You play as a cleaner for the mob. In each level you can find film reels that unlock a level with a theme from a classic film. Some of which include Alien, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and Suspiria! It's definitely worth a look. Pretty neato!"
,Recommended,522210,33847249,Posted: 27 July,all,DeadGavin,"Short version: An amazing 2D stealth game where fighting is not an option, but instead you clean up after the fight, which leaves for much more exciting gameplay than the actual fights would be.Story: The story is not the highlight of this game, but it isn't anything that is going to dampen my opinion of this game. The story is simple, you are in debt to the mafia, and in order to pay them back you clean up after their/other's crimescenes. Two of the clients end up butting heads, which eventually leads up to a challenging ""boss fight.""Gameplay: In order to clean up the scene of the crimes you would have to dispose of the bodies, grab key evidence, and mop up some blood. The only issue is, there are cops everywhere. There are objects to hide in, barriers to move to change their course throughout the area, and objects that you can activate to make noise to atract their attention. To complete each level you must sneak by the cops and clean up the area, which I found to be a lot more fun than I thought I would have.Stealth: Every time I opened up a new chapter I always scanned the map to see potential hiding places and try to come up with a plan before I dove in. If I messed up the plan, I would have to hide and almost always have to ditch my original plan to avoid being spotted again. What made this game's stealth a lot of fun for me was how it didn't seem like it was too tedious to do. I never felt like it was a chore to start a chapter over if I got caught towards the end, and instead I actually found it to be fun.I actually found it fun to start a level over, If found, the items and bodies would move a bit and I would be able to try a different course/adjust my first plan slightly.Is it worth it?: Yes, it definetly is. For 15 USD it is a bargan for the intuitive style of gameplay and all the fun that comes along with it.Side notes: I am not usually a fan of 2D games. I have really only liked a couple of them in the past, so me liking this game really says something. I would definetly recommend this game."
,Recommended,522210,33969512,Posted: 2 August,all,tearfromthered,"Not a hotline miami clone, even if some people think so due to the camera and blood. This is a die and retry STEALH game. You cannot neutralize the police you'll have to stay hidden and flee. Gorgeous art and music, simple and fun gameplay, big + is that each try of the same level, the objects are move to avoid you learning the perfect run. This is a bit limited in terms of mechanics and variety, a good fun for 2 to 5 hours with very frustating difficulty peak"
,Recommended,522210,34866462,Posted: 10 September,all,Yorick,"What abludgeoned body being fed to an alligatorgem of a game.Serial Cleaneris a stealth game where you play a cleaner (or fixer), going around crime scenes to dispose of bodies, collect evidence, and mop up blood. The art style and quick-yet-tactical pace immediately evoke comparisons toHotline Miami, which is one of my favourite games of all time. WhileSerial Cleanerdoesn't have the same depth of story (being quite straight forward and fairly predictable), the gameplay is as enjoyable. It plays like a mashup ofHotline MiamiandParty Hard, while also being different enough to stand apart.Each level has its own style, the soundtrack is amazing, and as the game progresses over the course of years, the difficulty really ramps up. It can be quite frustrating, and the random generation on each level can impact the difficulty quite drastically, but there's something so fun and addicting about it all the same. There are collectibles which unlock costumes and bonus levels (each based on different films), as well as a challenge mode.Creative, stylish, and a whole lot of bloody fun."
76561198197587821,Recommended,522210,25786147,"Posted: 30 September, 2016",all,Whitestrake,"Very fun, simple game mechanic with nice graphical style. A feature I really enjoyed was the fact that if you fail and then retry the level that the bodies, evidence, blood splatter and hiding places switch up each time you initiate a restart so you can't necessarily approach the level with your original game plan.One early (yet small) complaint would be AI, it seems a little bit of a cop out that when the police spot you, you can generally run and hide in a cupboard everytime and even though they see you enter they have no idea where you are. Even if your initial discovery led to a heightened suspicion from the cops or something along those lines would add a bit more depth to the 'stealth' aspect.Still an exciting project that I'm enjoying and I'm interested to see where it goes during it's development. If you're interest is piqued by this game I'd say give it a shot while it's only $10!"

Can be frustrating at times, like when you're so close to finishing the scene then you get caught and have to do the scene again. But it's still an interesting game. The collectable costumes, extra scenes and challenges just add to the enjoyment of this game."

The jokes/cultural references are pretty good, too. It was just enough of a challenge to finish the story and get all the achievements, and I can imagine picking it up to play again just a level or two at a time, for fun."
