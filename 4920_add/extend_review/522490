I'll probably keep playing it a lot more than I should, but yeah, definietly worth every cent. It's like a fun little mix of Pac-Man and Diner Dash with an art style that reminds me of Bubble Bobble. My only beef is that sometimes I pick up dishes when I don't want to pick up dishes because I'm trying to get food to some grouchy dock worker shark who's been waiting on his burger for like thirty seconds CALM DOWN SIR I SEE YOU IT'S ON IT'S WAY OVER JEEZSo maybe if you added a button to toggle dish picking up mode kind of like the black and white shields in Ikaruga that would make this game go from great to super friggin great, I think.Good stuff, can't wait to see what you come up with next."

While treading through the wave of filth, I stumbled upon this little diamond in the rough. I'll be honest, it was solely the game's art style that brought me over.  I was intrigued by the game's concept, it reminded me of Diner Dash, a Ds game I used to play a lot.  I decided to give this game my support, something this game was the first to receive from me, and currently the only game I've supported on the workshop.  After a few days, I completely forgot about this game.  A couple of days ago, I received an email from Steam telling me that this game was released, and you bet that I went and bought it...                                A few days later. What!? I'm a busy guy.  Carrie's Order up is visual porn, every little aspect of the game looks beautiful, from the retro-like cutscenes, to the little idle dance Carrie does, to the illustrations shown on the main menu.  It's obvious the artist behind this game has a large amount of talent and creativity.  The gameplay is similar to Pac-Man, with the player movie Carrie through a maze-like area while avoiding customers (ghosts).  What separates this game from Pac-Man is the fact that Carrie never stops moving, forcing the player to constantly paying full attention. Unlike Pac-man, however, Carrie can go past customers by spinning, but don't think you can get away with spinning past every enemy, as Carrie will get dizzy and eventually fall if you spin too much. The music in this game is also very well done, almost never getting too repetitive, and even if it does get repetitive, you can always change the music in the pause menu.  Despite all the positives this game has, there are a few negatives, but when I say few, I mean the very VERY little nitpicks I have. The voice acting in this game feels a bit unnatural and can sound a little strange at times, a few more takes could have helped a bit.  While the characters in this game are very charming, dialog between them can be awkwardly worded and feel a bit odd, but that will probably be a problem only I will have.All in all I feel that this game is very addictive, fun and perfect for people who don't have time to play any major releases."

My only gripe is that the controls feel a bit unresposive sometimes but that could just be my Keyboard. Other than that, I'd totally reccomend the game. Especially give how cheap it is too!I think you'll get alot of bang for your buck with this game!"

My excitement was really high during early play of this one, but dropped off pretty quickly.It's good, and definately worth the small asking price.But, unless you are driven by score chasing, there isn't much more after that.Essentially, this plays like a pizza parlor arcade game where you try to serve customers and earn money.The floor layouts change. You have a 'spin' maneuver where you can ghost through customers. There is nuance, which is appreciated.Pros:+Cheap, fun and fairly detailed for an arcade game+Original enough+Controller support is goodCons:-Storyline/storyboards are strange and I could do without them-Not really that much meat on the bone here; I got my fill after about an hour-Could do with more content overall, namely persistant upgradesIf you find yourself intrigued by pizza parlor arcade games, give this a shot."
,Recommended,522490,33119608,Posted: 2 July,all,TekkDan,"This is actually a well polished game, you would think that it's just a casual experience but it can get pretty fast paced at times (which makes sense having an arcade style to it).The game has you run around trying to avoid customers while at the same time needing to make sure they are kept served. You can either keep out of their way or you can spin past them. Spinning lets you pass through moving customers without being hit. Plates can be stacked together so you can serve multiple customers without having to go back to the counter after each one. There's powerups and hazards to keep aware of as well, plus dirty plates can be picked up and brought to the sink which improve your score but you can't carry food with them.The graphics are great to look at, they are retro styled but you can tell what things are supposed to be and they have a smooth animation to them. Sounds let you know whats going on and are nice as well. The music is something I can listen to multiple times and still enjoy hearing it.Here's a list of positives I would like to mention.+The story is nice to have and although short and simple its entertaining for what it is.+A good amount of unlockables such as different outfits for Carrie and Calcia, one of which activates holiday mode making the restaurant have a christmas theme.+Endless mode lets you see how far you can go as the difficulty ramps up.+The addition of voice acting is a nice touch which I didn't expect (I consider this a positive, but I do admit that a few more voice lines would of been great).+A variety of settings available if needed to be changed.+Statistics to see your overall progress, like how many times you bumped into customers for example.+Leaderboards and Steam Achievements plus challenges offer many more hours of gameplay if you dare to take them on.In my opinion the biggest plus in bonus content is that you can unlock and play as Calcia (the lobster girl behind the counter). I understand if this doesn't sound like such a big deal but the fact that they took the time and effort to make her even playable in the first place makes this a really cool feature. She plays similarly to Carrie but she is different enough that she gives a new experience to the game.Overall I think this game is well worth a try, especially for the content you're getting for the price. Sorry if I left anything important out, this is my first review but I hope it is useful to someone who is considering getting this game."

,Recommended,522490,26153512,"Posted: 21 October, 2016",all,Blue Klaw,"Easily the best arcade-style game on Steam. Absolutely worth the $2.99 price-tag; maybe even more.While the game may seem simple on the surface, there are actually a little bit of strategy in delivering food to hungry customers. Not only do the variety of colorful customers add to the game's charm, they also have different properties. There are standard customers, fast customers (will walk down aisles VERY quickly and demand their food be served quicker, too), impatient customers (walk at a normal pace, but wil quickly leave if not promptly served their food), and large customers (walk very slowly down aisles and will deplete more of your spin). Having to deal with all of these customer types at once makes the game challenging, but never too frustrating.There are only a couple things I don't like about this game: First, there seem to be a few minor bugs. Alternate costume unlocks were given to be before I had legitimately earned them, and on very rare occasions I can phase through tables (I think this has to do with taking corners while spinning past customers, but I'm unsure). At the time of writing, fullscreen mode looks a bit ugly on widescreen monitors, too; the big black bars along the sides of the game could've been replaced by simple wallpaper or tile textures. The positives vastly outweigh the negatives, though."

Present information in a format that feels organic and fun. Ensure that the challenge is scalable. The player becomes invested.

The visuals are appealing for two reasons; one, they really harken back to the old days, when I played on my sega mega drive. Just saying that name is just so nostalgic. And two, it's just plain adorable, which I'm a sucker for.That said, it can get a little chaotic on later levels, when the restaurant's full of customers who won't just CHOOSE A SEAT and SIT! And whose kid is that running around when I'm trying to work?!?Still, I loved it. It's cheap, challenging and easy to play."

In some aspects it is, but I enjoy the new challenges that the plate stacking, obstacle avoiding, and power ups bring. Even though I don't have a whole lot of time invested into it, I would say that this is one of my current favorites. Gives you a nice break from some of the other genres."

The game can get a bit difficult on Arcade mode, but other than that there's not much else to be said.
