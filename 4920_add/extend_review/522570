76561198038466696,Not Recommended,522570,25242333,"Posted: 29 August, 2016",all,Downright.,"Been some opinions that the only people saying good things about ""The Last Hope "" are the Dev's chums and pals and that could well be right.                                                                        I have spent far too      long wandering through  dull repititous corridors looking for mercury to put in a time machine.And what does a time machine look like anyway? There is no map ,no compass,no direction, no health bars no guns, nothing and you cann't pick things up. ""f"" doesn't do it or F 1 and there is no where to find out what does what. The electronic music is strident and awful. Doors open automatically sometimes and though wandering through gloomy corridors hardly tests it the game does look ok.          A game should suck you in; make you want to keep right on playing but ""The Last Hope "" doesn't do it for me.But even getting out of it is a fizz you can not save or exit .It's 2 bucks and that's about what it's  worth now.  . It certainly needs to and hopefully it will get better."

You should not have to jump over steps just to get up a ramp in the hallway.- The ambient soundtrack is annoying and repetitive. This game could definitely benefit from better localised and volume balanced ambient noises.- Ceiling fans sound like guillotines.- Door frames have to be jumped over.- The supposedly alive people in the intro level look like animatronic robots, and not the good ones.- Ambient models are ambiguous, not clearly defined as to their purpose. (i.e. was that supposed to be a robotic arm with a camera on it or ...... why would a camera the size of a Buick be on a robotic arm?)- No difficulty modifier.- It looks like the game was made in Garrys Mod, only not that good.- Why did I just get transformed into a viking on a space station?- Was that supposed to be a space station to planet transport tube or did brick walls collide in the middle of the hallway?- Was I supposed to collect animals once I got off the space station?- I couldn't justify spending any more time on the game at this point."

,Not Recommended,522570,25342121,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,I lick the tip. :),"Due to the price of this game, I was hoping to give it a positive review. Only with what I've experienced so far in just 20 minutes, I can't. I'll list the problems that I found.- Spelling errors - yes, this game isn't an AAA titled game but it seems as if the dev didn't even bother going through his own game. One thing was ""unusuall"". I'm fine with that as the dev may just not know how to spell it, but I found things like ""teletort"". That almost makes me certain he didn't bother going through his endless corridors. Oh, that brings me to another problem.- Intro corridors - instead of adding a book that you pick up and read through, the dev decided it would be a good idea to add crappy looking corridors for no reason. That's one of the two main reasons I'm giving this game a negative review. Not only did he include endless corridors when no text was shown, he let us see text through the walls of a corridor and around the corner as well as failing to place the text within the air and let it stick half way through the wall.- First level (or whatever you'd call it) - this was the biggest problem and is the whole reason I'm giving it a negative review. I wasn't quite sure what I was supposed to do in it, but running in the middle of the path and getting stuck on stones a centimeter off the ground is not what I was supposed to do. Then I would run into a gorilla or dinosaur which wasn't moving at all and guess what happened? It despawned and I did that over and over until I ran into one dinosaur which made me fail and I thought it was time to write this review.If the dev remakes the whole intro and fixes whatever was happening in the first level, I'll change this review, otherwise that last hope that I have - is gone."

76561198130416443,Not Recommended,522570,29284023,Posted: 15 January,all,beefsupreme,"I never write negative reviews, but this game as it stands right now, is a horrible piece of S. I can give the graphics a pass other than the first few minutes of running around the ""lab"" which almost give you a seizure running through the hallways due to the grid patterns of the walls and floor flying by. The game is really really random with a nonsense storyline, one minute you're a scientist? then you cause a catasrophic time machine failure and transform to a viking in Norway to save humanity from everything? Really jumps around, Maybe if they revamped the story and fixed the grammer of ingame text and totally made a different game it would be good. But right now I can't recommend this game even if if were free. I guess maybe I'll re-look at this game in a year?"

,Not Recommended,522570,30917866,Posted: 3 April,all,bobsamurai,"I play these $.50 games just to laugh at, I feel like this game could have been fun if not for it constantly draining your food and water meters. The levels are sloppily thrown together with random assets, Its actually quite comical, but we arent given enough time to explore them thanks to the ""survival"" elements. Also because the levels are packed with enemies, any time you touch one you lose 10% hp. When taking a brisk walk through a forest its easy to to spot dinosaurs, horses, space ships, small pink anime looking balls of fluff, and robots, its totally random. I can't recommend this game because the survival meters are too unforgiving and many of the pickups to restore them simply didnt work. Also this game features terrible framerate issues when passing through zones with far to many enemies and it may be too dark for some. Your sole objective in the game is to travel from point A to point B and push an item over on its side. If the ""developer"" is reading this, please patch the game to give the players a God mode option so we can mess around and explore the crazy world."
76561198017827204,Not Recommended,522570,28973977,Posted: 3 January,all,Arucard,"Would make a much, much better short story than a game, there is no gameplay other than rush to the 'exit portal'. The exit portal is a box you push off of a platform. Read that again to make sure you understoodit...ok?A race against time as your hunger/thirst and then health constantly drain, you must pick up food and drink along the way, kinda basic but not a big deal. The real pain is all the enemies wandering around like statues on wheels, and no way whatsoever to attack or defend, just avoid everything and rush to the exit. Even rushing through the levels wouldn't be so bad if there were anything interesting to see. Graphics are decent, but look like they may be taken from a free texture site, and without any animations aside from your character even that is below average.It would be bad enough without the bugs, but holy crap are there bugs. Keep in mind this is not a pre-alpha or in-development, THIS IS THE GAME! Only buy if you have a great sense of humor or as a drinking game or something, otherwise give your $2 to a homeless person.TL;DR - The experiment was a DISASTER."

,Not Recommended,522570,34958091,Posted: 14 September,all,Alalius,"The controls are janky, the game play is confusing. It goes for a third person style like Uncharted, but didn't get the camera to work quite right. To get to level select you have to complete a tutorial-esque prologue that is way longer than it needs to be. The plot might be good, it's just too cliche and the text is harder to read than it should be. I would say that, unless all you care about are trading cards, don't get this game. It really isn't worth what it costs and should be a F2P IMO."

The visuals are absolutely stunning, the weather and soundtrack are absolutlely immersive, and don't even get me started on the fabulously created crafting system, where you feel as though everything you make will definetely help you and wont be disposed of after you get a better thing. The loot drop system is amazing, with over 5 jimmiemillion possibilities for weapons. The progression system feels fluent and co-ordinated, and when you unlock another of the 200 skills you know its going to be a valuable asset to your quest. The storyline is not the best, but still sufficed to make me stay up one night crying and praying to GaBe thatYour son is actually your fathers dead grandsons sisters neices friends step dads uncle. And dont even get me started on the characters; I felt so deeply connected to each and every one of them and truly felt like they stood for a cause which was reasonable, and after I saw their pasts I nearly bought a body pillow of each and every one of the 600 main characters. And to the star of the show, the combat. My god, the blocking system, gunplay, melee battles, boss battles, dont even get me started on the superb stealth missions. This game is truly a masterpiece, and all of this, at the price of a pint of beer. If you have any respect for yoursself, you will buy this absolute masterpiece and play every second of it. It made me a changed man. 6/10 ""Its ok""-IGN"

,Recommended,522570,26022514,"Posted: 13 October, 2016",all,snuzi,"Initially I had purchased this game thinking it would be another fun, mindless hack and slash game with RPG elements and crafting (like most of my favorite games i.e. minecraft, starcraft, warcraft, guncraft, fruitcraft, and sims online)I was very surprised to see that this game is not only EDUCATIONAL but ARTISTIC in scale and scope. I have read the reviews and am very disappointed with people's interpretations of this fine work. These people i.e. uneducated plebians, gas station workers, political activisits, burger king seat attendants, grass people, soup kitchen engineer, life hack coachers, staples managers, subway (eat fresh) bathroom guards, etc. simply DON'T understand the inner workings and deeper meanings presented in this fine work.This fine work is a amalgamtion of all things curltural, hystorical, sexual, timeal, and. It speaks to both our human selves and our animils self very well in that it continues to flesh out the correlation and coronation of selves within to first dominated and engineer a proper rebuttal for one's own lust, greed, love, sex, addiction, and. It properly transcends the inner workings of this fine work, unifying and gratifying for all intents and purposes, the one true meaning behind gaming, and internet culture, forming a single orginism (this is only an example) which never ceases to surprise and astound my visual, spiritual, and sexual senses, and.I feel as though perhaps most of these negatival reviews simply didn't play through the first level and didn't expwerience the same craftsmanship that I did. And.This is a time travel story that delves deep into our cultures and has alot to say about us as people, nations, and colors. AndPerhaps this fine work will; be better appreciated in a few years' time. Like a fine whine, or a delicious smoked trout, age is but a number, and only serves to enhance the flavor, taste, palette, and sexual energy of the work.Please, don't let the naysayers fool you! This si worth your time and worth the $1.99 it costs. It will give you 4+ hours of enjoyment on New Game. new Game + will entitled you to an editional 6.6+ hours of secrets, mazes, bosses, sexual advances and cutscenes, and.It's worth a try for 2 bucks, right? It's orth a lil tap? It's worth a lil game. Just buy two copies and you ca play the upcoming multiplayer time campaign which is located in Ireland (this game has alot to say about alcohol, so top drinking countries, such as us, ireland, german, russian, bangladesh, etc has alot to say about alchohols)Give it a chance is all I ask, and.Thank you for your time, hope this was a helpful review. I am friends with the developer and was paid good money for this review. honestly, about 50% of everything you spend goes to me from here on out so please buy this game so I can line my pockets properly. Please buy 2 or 3 copies minimum. I need the money.And."
