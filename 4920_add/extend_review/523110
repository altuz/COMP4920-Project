,Not Recommended,523110,32117521,Posted: 1 June,all,Machi,"So I got this program just to trim my instant replays and assemble them into short gameplay videos. I knew full well that this wasn't a full blown video production program the likes of Premiere or Vegas Pro. I also checked the product comparison page on their website and looked over the features (Movie Studio 14 Steam Edition is exactly the same as the normal Movie Studio 14, which they should DEFINITELY make clear on here), and it fit the usecase I had intended for it perfectly fine (or so I thought).Now, here's the kicker, altho they note that it has ""Support for 50p and 60p projects"", you can't actually select a rendering template that does 60p, which means that altho you can EDIT in 60 fps just fine, you can't actually RENDER in 60 fps.Now this wouldn't be an issue if they actually let you edit the preset templates but due to ""Customizable render templates"" not being included in this version, you can't actually adjust any rendering parameters.Now I understand that this is their most basic version, but really, rendering to 60 fps should be standard. This isn't 2007 anymore, 1080p 60 fps videos are becoming more and more common and since this is the steam version, you'd expect to actually be able to show off your gameplay in 60 fps.In my opinion, there's two ways to fix this, one being the nice way and the other one being the slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gy way:Add in a few rendering templates for 60 fps renderingGive people the ability to upgrade to VEGAS Movie Studio 14 PlatinumIf they add either of those 2 options, I'll change the review to a positive one, as the software itself seems decent for the money.As a side note, rendering seems to be very slow in this compared to for example Resolve or Premiere, just transcoding the video took longer than the video itself, and I have an 8 core CPU... Don't know if I'm missing something here."

,Not Recommended,523110,32116425,Posted: 1 June,all,This is Gary Huang,"Thanks for the special promotion, but I still think that this is the worst edition ever.(I can not believe this is worst than MS13P)After 93 minutes of ""play time"", I find out that the UI is better, and I can say that the rending time is a bit faster that MS13P, but also I can not find some of the stuff in the old vision.And I hope that Movie Studio 14 Platinum can be in Steam, because I do not want to pay money for a half vision of Movie Studio 14 Platinum."

When I got this version and opened it to find that they removed many features, I was shocked. There is no longer a video trimmer in which you can trim videos before putting them in your timeline, and the only thing under the ""View"" tab is ""Reset to default"". I tried using it anyways because 10 would not accept 4K videos. This version does, but it has limited export options and many of them are under 720p. There is only one that reaches near 4K.Clearly, this product line no longer qualifies as a professional movie editor. If you want something decent, look elsewhere."

,Not Recommended,523110,32107668,Posted: 1 June,all,DeltaForce C:/Windows95,"They (new developer) seperated Movie Studio into two versions. Platinum and Basic.Steam version is basic and you can't even create your own render plans. You have nooption but choose pre-planned rendering templates.This deserves ""very negative"" reviews, have no idea why people giving positive,because its basically a demo. Also rendering speed still same.All those features were available in Movie Studio 13.Greed at its finest."

,Recommended,523110,32078029,Posted: 30 May,all,siddNullus,"For the price, it's a really powerful piece of editing software.  Not much of a difference between Vegas 13 and 14, except for the GUI.  I do like 14's GUI far better than 13's attempt at touch interface."
,Recommended,523110,32831943,Posted: 26 June,all,Gohlemi,I kinda like this edition it is easy to use and follows you on your steam-library years to come. I have been using Vegas for good 10years now and I usualy only edit some gameplay or hunting videos so this edition have enough features to make simple videos on youtube. 9/10 light editor for light and easy video editing.
,Recommended,523110,32120533,Posted: 1 June,all,MarkH123456,"This is a good product if your buying it during the special promotion and if you are coming from Windows Movie Maker. It has stuff like pan and crop and a couple of thing from Sony Vegas Pro. If your not buying this during the special promotion, buy platinum version, its only 10 dollars more and has more features. One downside to this is that you can't render videos at 1080p 60fps. You can however, render video's at 720p 60fps. Overall, if your making some basic youtube poops or your coming from Movie Maker, I would recommend it."

A lot of options when you want to edit a video , rendering option is good but not perfect ( if you have a slow pc you will stay much time to render a video ) . I recommend it 90% !!"

If you want to view the Preview Video in a seprate window, or have it use GPU exceleration for rendering, or have a cap on how much you can compress the video . Dont buy this one, buy the Platinum or the Pro(if you can offord this one)."

,Not Recommended,523110,34362714,Posted: 19 August,all,CommanderRoberts94,When I first bought this software it said I can download onto YouTube. Well for everyone unless you want to use there standard file saving and have a hobby of just editing and no pubishing to an actual site that will support 'Movie Studio Project File (''.vrf)' ONLY then save yourself some money and go an buy somthing decent cause it is a waste here. Thought vegas was meant to be good as recommended. I guess I should have gone and bought something 80 pounds instead of 20. I can see why its called vegas cause your left with this rubbish deal. AS I TOLD YOU ALL GO SOMEWHERE BETTER AND BUY SOMETHING YOU KNOW BE BETTER!!!!!!!!!
