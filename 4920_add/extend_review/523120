,Recommended,523120,33571667,Posted: 15 July,all,weirdphil,"Works pretty great. I've been using other versions of Sony VEGAS Pro for years and have noted that there are many features in Pro that I'm just not going to use or need. Never wanted to buy it because of the $400/500 price tag, but I wanted something that would work better than Windows Movie Maker. If you have also used VEGAS in the past, you'll likely be right at home. Masking is still a thing here, it's just not in an obvious place you might remember, it's no longer in the Pan/Cropping menu, and you can't use a Pen or Lasso tool, but by using a Cookie Cutter tool or the Mask Generator Video FX Plug-in, which may not float your boat. You can also use the ""Compositing Parent/Child"" button on the Video track head to adjust visibility of the video tracks in a masking technique of sorts. In my opinion, a masking Pen/Lasso tool alone is not worth $400. I want one, but I don't want one that bad.Per YouTube's requirements, for those of you looking for good video editing software for your usual YouTube Let's Play videos, you can get 1080x60fps.mp4 files. While this software does mention it has exporting options for YouTube Facebook and Vimeo, it appears that using said options will produce a lower quality video ( an estimated 1 Gb video would be around 86 Mb using this feature) so I doubt I will ever use that, but I'm sure it must be useful to somebody.Bottom line is, buy this, then delete any other version youtorrentedaqcuired because you wont need anything else. If you're looking to give this a test run, do it quick because rendering 10-minute 1080p videos will easily take 2 - 5 hours to complete and you'll have passed the point of no return before you know it.If you're already using editing software you aquired fromtorrentsquestionable origin and you would like to something cheap and more legitimate, this is a good buy. If you're still using version 13 and you're absolutely fine where you're at, there's not likely a reason to upgrade unless you really just want to have the latest version.(Edited to elaborate on masking.)"

Now that I'm employed, I have stopped pirating just about evrything. I restored my computer recently to start a clean slate, and realized I forgot to grab the Vegas 10 Pro installer. Not wanting to through all the hastle of pirating it again, I looked into the newer installments. I was rather nervous becasue I've used V 10 for so long that I thought anything newer wouldn't feel the same (like Microsoft Office, 2007 is the best), and I'll have to learn shortcuts and editing technics all over again.Once I found this on steam, for 35% off, I added it to my cart and stared at it for a while. Instead of sweating over the ""what if's"" I said f**k it, and bought the damn thing. Safe to say I made a good purchase! Not only are all the shortcuts are the same (from what I can tell) there are a lot of new added features! I feel right at home! I've only used it for about 45 min., but I'm happy to say that I'm not dissapointed!"

It does not include some of the key upgrades such as the BlueFx package. No upgrade possible, complained to non-responsive customer service, but no refund. I bought and for first time regretted a Steam purchase."

76561197993148248,Recommended,523120,33614712,Posted: 17 July,all,pixl,"Seems a very competent piece of software, considering the price! Tried editing a straight forward video with 4 video tracks and 3 audio. Used .mp4 files, .mov files with transparency as well as .mp3 and .wav, exported as a 1080p 60fps video. Having hobby-level experience with Vegas Pro 13 and a dayjob working in Premiere, I'd say this is on par with any ""high end"" program for straight forward things. Would recommend to anyone in need of something better than what's free (like Windows Movie Maker)."

I truly believe that this cut-down version of the almighty Sony Vegas pro is very good value for money. The only thing that is missing which I noticed between the almighty vegas pro and this version is the masking tool as well as you can't add more than 200 tracks but seriously 200 audio & Video tracks is more than enough to satisfy any video editing enthusiast and the software just works.

Tried all settings still crashes.  Waste of money for a useless program.  It works in 1080p no problem it just crashes in 4k.  Stay away from it if you plan on editting anything greater than 1080p.

CUDA acceleration does not work on modern Nvidia hardware despite the website stating support for GTX 480/580s and newer. Come to find out only the new 15 version coming out in a few months will actually do what is says on the tin and support CUDA properly. I took too long confiming it would not work with the program open in the background and doing short rendering tests that the software can not be refunded. Now i am stuck with defective software  that is no better than the version of Vegas I had before. The only positive is not having to mess with disks or key cards which is nice (but hardly worth the price). Also worth noting is some of the FX stuff included with the retail version does not appear to be included in the Steam version, and Dvd Architect etc needs to be purchased seperately."
