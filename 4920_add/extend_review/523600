76561198016404452,Not Recommended,523600,31223774,Posted: 18 April,all,Elementalist,"***Please note this review was upon the very initial release***In the world of card design, there are 2 reasons to create cards: The first is that you want to create cards for an existing game, either to rework existing cards, or to add or supplement what was officially published for your own home rules. The second reason is to design your own game.In the world of card design, there are 2 types of people who create cards: The first is the serious gamer/designer, who wants cards of high fidelity regarding an existing property or to create something that is uniquely theirs, that could be trademarked or copyrighted. The second is the casual/new gamer/designer who doesn't care about fidelity and simply needs the mechanic the card infers.Card Creator serves absolutely none of the four possibilities of overlap on this punnet square, and seems to have been developed in the absence of the above information and does not deserve your money. I'll explain why.SERIOUS GAME DESIGNERLet us say, you are a serious designer. You want to add cards to existing games, either tabletop ones such as Dominion, Sentinels of the Multiverse, Legendary, Dead of Winter, Agricola, Robinson Crusoe etc. or LCG/TCGs such as the Pathfinder Adventure card game, Magic: The Gathering, Star Realms or Yu-Gi-Oh. Fidelity is not something Card Creator can offer in any of these contexts. Here's why.SYMBOLS:Many of these games are combat based and require things like attack, defence and health. There are symbols you can put in, but the variety without the specificity to the context of many fantasy tropes is disconcerting. There is no simple sword or shield, though there are various weapon icons or armour based ones.In the case of TCGs, rarity is an integral component. Yet this program offers no way to change the colour of the symbols used to delineate common, uncommon or rare.Additionally, the symbols may only be placed in specific circles on the inside of the card art, and not anywhere else on the card, such as underneath certain values in the top/bottom right/left of the card or next to the sub-heading of the card underneath the art, such as where the Magic: The Gathering symbol resides.ART:Many games have full bleed art without the text boxes, but still with text. This program cannot do that. It cannot recreate those full art MtG cards. Additionally, the art can only be placed in the one spot relative to certain other elements of the template. While you can remove the top title box and instead have the title underneath the art, you cannot move the description to the top of the card with the art below. The art must also be in a square box. While you can round the edges of the text boxes, not so with the art box. You cannot place a border around the art beyond a set square. Oh and did you want a border design for your card? No. Too bad.You want to colour code your cards? Well, you can't have different text boxes different colours. All text boxes must have the same colour as each other. You want something other than a solid colour, perhaps a gradient or even a texture? Nope. Doesn't exist.TEXT:You have one font. That's it. You cannot bold, italicise, underline, strikethrough, or align left/center/right. You cannot change the size of the font. Basic functions of any program that uses text simply do not exist here. What if your card doesn't have a picture, but simply text in different ways? Well, you can have 3 paragraphs technically, but you cannot separate those paragraphs with lines, or other more interesting designs. It is all one big, square, solid colour, block of text.SIZING:There are two preset sizes of Standard and Mini. This of course covers every card size present in games today. While yes you can manually adjust the heigh measurement, it is unclear how this impacts the dimensions of the card, as you can only change 1 dimension. Not 2. You cannot accurately be sure if you have made a Tarot-sized card. or a square card. Speaking of sizing, you cannot adjust the horizontality or verticality of the card easily. There is technically a setting for this, but it is not clearly defined what the output then looks like or how it measures. It also applies to the entire set, which is not a bad thing per se, as you can always just create a second set for different cards. But still.The fact is, for serious game designers, there is too much functionality not included in this program, or not enough content like symbols. There is no Steam workshop so no chance to upload new templates, or fonts or symbols, or anything else anyone would want to include on their card. If you're serious about designing, you will use Photoshop for the unlimited customisability which this program cannot even approach.CASUAL GAME DESIGNERSo what if you're a casual designer and you want a quick and easy-mock up? Maybe you want to just do the pre-alpha for a new game you designed, or you want to add cards to Dominion, or Race for the Galaxy, or Shadows Over Camelot without a care for how the card looks? And you don't have the time or money to use photoshop? Well, I would ask if you'd rather pay $15-20 for this program, or $0 for something which does the same job.MAGIC SET EDITORIf you haven't heard of this program, look at it and try to use it before this one. I don't work on or for the people who designed that in any way, and I don't receive any money from them. But if you only need mock ups, then MSE is free and can do that. Sure, there is perhaps slightly less adjustment you can do, as you have to use a pre-made template. However, even on their website, the base package comes with a few dozen templates which all have more unique feeling that what can be designed in this program. Did I mention it was free?CONCLUSIONI want to like this program. There is definitely a niche for an accessible, customisable card creator. But this program is not it. If you're serious about design, you'll use photoshop. If you're casual, why spend the money at all and not just use Magic Set Editor, Strange Eons, or a web-based card creator likegodeckyourself.comorcrobi.github.io/rpg-cardsI really want to like this program, but it has no real audience. And the audience it will capture, it will only capture because of a lack of awareness of what else is out there which also fulfills their need. Card Creator has all the feel of a v0.1 release. It feels like all of these Early Access titles that are charging money, that have some content and basic functionality. But this program simply doesn't deliver.Shame on the developer for releasing a program that has this little functionality for this sort of price. It may be all well and good to say ""we are currently working on many of the features you have concerns about"" but if you're saying that, then you weren't smart enough to realise they would be concerns in the first place.Use something else.***2.0 Review on September 3rd***Pros: Layering, Card Backing, Good Exporting.Cons: Program is still unwieldy, lacks customisation, is highly unintuitive and could use tutorials.I understand the devs have a roadmap and seem very passionate about this product, and I am following it with great hope and interest. But at this point it still really does not command its asking price in my opinion."

If there was a wait and see option for the review I would have selected that.  I use Nandeck to help make the cards for my prototypes. Card Creator Does not replace Nandeck for me.  What this program needs is a way to import card text from a CSV or Excel spreadsheet. I can only Export after I entered the cards in the software. I can't recommend this for now but hopefully over time they add more features and allow more flexibility.

76561198249679068,Recommended,523600,32771989,Posted: 25 June,all,BriLila9891,"So, since I have played 2+ hours on the software I thought I would write a review.It's an awesome software where you can create cards in any shape and style you want.Pros:1. You can customize your card with any color, aspect, text, etc. you want.2. You can customly put in how big you want your cards to be when they print.3. You can select the quality of the cards (1x, 2x, 3x, and 4x).Cons:1. When you print them out, you would may want glossy printing paper or card, which could be more expensive than the software itself.2. Cutting the cards can be a pain in the neck if you don't have a paper cutting board.3. It doesn't have a big selection of icons, so you may need to make your own.So basically you need some materials to cut and print the cards. If you want make a big collection of cards, and you don't have a paper cutting board or any kind of sharp scissors, you may want to go and buy that before you get the game.Overall, I would rate the game a 7/10."

,Recommended,523600,31262416,Posted: 20 April,all,Wisp,"As the other reviews will tell you, Card Creator is a bit limited right now compared to older programs out there, although it can definitely still be used to quickly make cards for fun, build a simple card game, or easily prototype a larger card game.I've admittedly been waiting for this release for quite a while and have high hopes for them, and while I have to say that $20 for what it does at this time is a bit of a stretch, the devs are talking through issues with users in the discussion threads to solve problems and mention features they might work on next that users have requested, so I think that's a good sign.Right now this is a good option for simple projects, but I believe it'll be even better later. If it's missing features you really want but you're still interested, instead of buying or dismissing this right away, why not click 'follow' so you'll get updates and see when they've updated enough that you feel like jumping in?"

Simple to use and very powerful.Recommended for card game prototyping, and also for printint and authoring.The developers are improving and adding new features, so if you make card games don´t hesitate and buy it, it really worths the price."
,Not Recommended,523600,31246978,Posted: 19 April,all,Keep,"The build of this application is stable.Would I recommend this software to other indie game designers for prototype creation?-No, not at its current state.Would I recommend this software to other indie game designers for production layout?-No.  It's a very basic application.Granted the UX is slick, minimalistic and pleasing to the eyes.  It's just not flexible enough to create any card you want.  It pretty much sticks to the format of how Magic the Gathering cards are laid out.  You can adjust sliders to manipulate the size of each part of the card.  However, you cannot manipulate the orientation or (on the build I was testing) the alpha of them either.  And for some reason they use aspect ratio when determining the size of the card.  That confuses me, like the devs haven't done anything in the card making industry before.  It should be either standard sizes like Poker, mini-poker, tarot, etc.  Or at least give a unit of measurement on the sliders either in centimeter or inches.It says you can import your own artwork, but only into main object designated for artwork.  There are areas all over the card where you can place icons, but those icons must be chosen from a set of predefined icons.  You cannot import your own icons.At launch the PDF export was bugged, but thankfully the dev was quick to patch this back into operation.  The dev's seem like nice people, and are what seems to be always watching and answering the discussion threads on this project.  So, I'll give them props there.  Excellent job on communication.As it stands, I would rank this application as an early access release, like version 0.8-beta not a 1.0 release candidate.  I understand that they have a lengthy list of things they want to add, and maybe once those come into being it will be worth the $20 price.  But I cannot recommend this application to anyone other than people just wanting to make cards for fun."

76561197985716653,Recommended,523600,34530075,Posted: 27 August,all,Danner,"As of the current revision (27. Aug 2017) this program feels like it is in early alpha. You can make cards with a decent amount of flexibility, and the results are suprisingly useful. But there are quirks and bugs that make the program incredibly tedious to use, and you will encounter some hard limitations you cannot sidestep at all.For example; If you load a card set from the main menu, you do not load it with any of the customized look & feel you spent the latter hour to perfect. These has to be loaded separately. Oh you did not save those separately earlier you say? Though luck.For example: If you export your cards as a PDF, the process will FAIL if you did it already. To resolve this, you must go into your save folder and delete all the previously exported data, carefully avoiding to delete the card data or separately-saved-styles residing in the same folder in the process.For example: I really wish I could have put some smaller font on the flavour section of the card. Flavour text that take up 80% of the card real estate is annoying, and I ended up having to cut it as a result. I don't mind if the users have to strain their eyes to read that part.Issues like this aside, I have great faith in the concept. It certainly meets a niche, and saved me from spending the weekend playing with HTML to make cards that wouldn't have looked half as good. I feel the money might be worth it at some point. But right now I feel the asking price is a bit steep compared to how many quirks you have to dodge. Hopefully that will improve."

76561198136435052,Recommended,523600,31221313,Posted: 18 April,all,GrimToadstool,"*Update*The breaking bugs I referred to in the Version2 review have been fixed or worked around and thus I will I can recommend the software now. Keep in mind that the devs really turned around from a supposedly finished product and are working closely with the community to make the product worth it, many feature will be improved, others added. It's basically early access.Version 2 Review (free review copy):The current trailer is outdated and referrs to the first version, the same goes for my original review, which is posted below for refference. The devs took a lot of critizism I had to heart and changed the program for the better. New stuff brings new bugs and these new bugs likely result in dataloss, so that needs to be fixed, before I can recommend the software, but keep and eye on it, it's on a really good path. I've posted the changes I wish yet to see in this thread:http://steamcommunity.com/app/523600/discussions/0/1473095965299171339/The notable improvements over the original version are1 - You can now edit the layout freely.2 - Cards are now properly seperated into a blueprint card and a dataset that's made from the blueprint.Original Review (refunded pruchase) 73/78 helpful votes:This card creator is sadly completely lacking. There's only one layout that's supported, you can adjust minor things such as how big certain areas are, but that's that. Want the picture at the bottom? No not possible. Want to edit the back of the card? Not possible. If the cards you want to create use that one supported layout, then maybe you can use this, but it's way overpriced for that. As a creativity tool, it's currently completly useless. Then there are minor things, such as aspect ratios are given as a decimal, for example a square is 1 instead of 1:1, 16:9 or the golden ratio you can't even pick, because of the inconvenient decimal result.The idea behind the tool is good, but It should be ""early access"" as it's far from a feature complete experience. I cannot recommend it, not with the few features provided, not for the price."

,Not Recommended,523600,31797857,Posted: 16 May,all,YuushaGamer,"I bought it as I wanted to make a TCG, tried it and refunded it. It's a good concept but I would honestly concider re-desigining it. Instead of having sliders allow users to customize the card even further by being able to click the area and re-sizing it like microsoft word does for images. In addition for images it's annoying when entering a new line in discription and having the box get pushed up. Also you should be able to customize the card however you want and not just have tick boxes for different aspects of the card. As for the price I feel it's a bit much for what it is right now maybe somewhere around £9.99 instead."

And i really qick found my way into it. It took me about 15 minutes to realize what to do and at the end of the day i had a fully playable card set of 50 cards. Cool. Now lets try them out in the Tabletop Simulator. Yes this works and without doing anything. Just render a card set and use the render TTS Files in TTS.Ok but as allways there is something to complain about.Biggest issue is the text field and usabilty. Starting of with a lack of usefull features like cursivefont, outline or bold fonts which could save a lot of time in my two projects. But mostly annoying it the samll text field. There is basicly a window just big enough to show like 3 or 2 words. This means changing something is hard to do so, because you can´t click arround and need to move the cursor by the arrows key. Bad for  a big text.Second annyoing thing is. Need to admitt only annoying because i needed a blueprint (the raw card design) serveral times little adjusted. There isn´t a copy option i needed to created each time new.Could allthough be possible that i am to dumb and new to find the requested features.Maybe in the future I will know.In that case an update for this review will come.At this state a clearly recommend it to this software if you search for an lazy solution and got tired of using photoshop."

,Not Recommended,523600,35388532,Posted: 1 October,all,cubbymoore,"At present I've tried this twice, reinstalling it to see if the recent updates had made an improvement. My main gripe when I last tried it was that the output quality was extremely low, even on it's highest setting.I made a relatively simple deck that I'd done most of the grunt work on using photoshop and inkscape with, it was just compiling the images on to cards, which I'm surprised there isn't any way to do in a batch. Just doing this process the program crashed 3 times on me, making me lose significant progress the first 2 times, and then I basically kept hitting save after doing each card after that, just in case.Then I tried to export those cards I'd made, in order to see how the Tabletop Simulator exporting works, mainly. Well, the first time the program just froze, I left it for 30 minutes just in case and nothing. Closed it, restarted. Tried exporting again, it got 25% of the way through and crashed properly. Restarted. It got about 60% of the way this time and then crashed again. So I haven't actually found out how the Tabletop Simulator exporting is yet.And just generally, the program feels weak. There's no hover over info on features, so you're not sure what a button will do until you click it. There's no real in program help in any way. There should be a lot more features that should be available with a right click on elements that you're editing. Like being able to delete or copy an element. It's a shame because there is potential here, but it still doesn't feel in any way finished. I'm going to wait until v3 or even v4 before trying this again. It might not crash then."

They've made some minor updates that have fixed bugs, but unless there's a major overhaul to the core design elements, I can't recommend it.I wish I could be more detailed, but I'm exhausted from having spent the last two hours trying to get the software to do something simple like change font size."

It's simple, easy to use, and the design features are intuitive. The only thing I can see as being a problem worth mentioning to the developers is that either the ability to export single cards one-by-one (without the rest of the page) is well hidden, or doesn't exist. More simply put, I'd like to see a way to export cards for the use of the image file online rather than only being able to export cards with the intent of printing them out. Other than that, this product is worth what I paid for it. With the addition of the feature I mentioned above, I'd rate it 10/10.EDIT: I was dumb, the third printing option (default 88.9mm) does this. Perfect 10/10, would suggest this product to anyone."

Or just create a Card game with your friends and print it in an instant.I'm definitely waiting for upcoming new options like custom image boxes, but for now I'm happy with the producto :)"

I watched videos on Youtube before pruchasing but the new version on Steam is different. The software either dropped features since version 1, or I just can't find them. Like the Format menu.  Where is it? How do you make rounded corners or chage the border? The sofware also seems to have European bias.  Things like export to letter sized paper are not in the menu."
