,Recommended,523660,32635049,Posted: 21 June,all,Yeti,"I will be adding occasional, concise updates regarding changes significant enough to mention in the comments on this review to keep information up to date without making this review a multi-page essay.SummaryHYPERCHARGE: Unboxed is a pleasant surprise. I absolutely love Co-Op wave based survival games and tower defense games so seeing this pop up on Steam's Upcoming was exciting. I decided to just go for it with semi-low expectations and pick it up on release for $15 and I'm honestly glad I did. In it's current state, an early pre-alpha, it doesn't offer a lot in terms of content or replayability but what it has in copious amounts is potential. The visuals are incredible, mechanically it's very solid, combat and movement is polished and fluid, has a great and fitting soundtrack and overall the audio is pretty good. Digital Cybercherries have also heavily emphasized community interaction and personally working with them to make HYPERCHARGE the best it can be. The foundation for an incredible game is here and what you'd be primarily paying for currently is an investment and support in the development team as well as a chance to watch this game and its community grow. I have owned my fair share of Early Access games and a lot of them have been abandoned or failed to become a worthwhile game but based on what HYPERCHARGE has and the commitment promised from the developers I have a lot of faith and excitement for this games future.-----------------------------------------------Pros* Visuals are impressive, almost a bit surreal. They really nailed the toy store aesthetic between the plastics, toy boxes, visual effects, sounds, and overal scale.* Though you are usually confined to the isle of a toy store, there's a whole new level of freedom when you're the size of an action figure. You're able to climb up through all the boxes, racks, and hangars making the toy store feel more like a jungle, adding an unexepected depth to the isles.* A lot of little easter eggs and comedic design hidden throughout the game. Exploring the map and checking out all the various toys on the shelves is pretty entertaining.* The mechanics, movement, and gunplay are really solid and surprisngly well polished. Overall the game feels great to play.* There's a fair amount of customization for your player model and they executed it very well. The models are very well done, from the color schemes to the general design and you can have the color scheme persist to your weapons and turrets.* It runs well. Rarely dip below 60 FPS max settings @1440p with a GTX 780.* Comprehensive settings menu for graphics, controls, audio, and some gameplay.-----------------------------------------------ConsKeep in mind, this game is pre-alpha. The developers have stressed how early in development this game is so expect the usual lack of content, bugs, and general quirks of a pre-alpha game. I will use strikes and italics to represent changes since I wrote this review* There's not a lot of content or replayability at the moment. There'sno progression so the entirety of the game currently consists of playing onalso not a lot of progression yet, mainly consists of upgrading defenses but there is an inactive exp system for future updates. Currently there is only 4 maps with 5 weapons and 5 mostly cosmetic attatchments to choose from.and a few turrets.There are now 11 buildables, added traps.* There are some bugs.The most notable so far are the audio for the MG turrets will frequently get stuck on an infinite loop until you restart and enemies can sometimes get stuck outside the map requiring you to restart the match.Word from the developers is this has been fixed.* Multiplayer can be a bit laggy. Not unplayable by any means but it's inconvenient at times.-----------------------------------------------ConclusionShould you buy it? Short answer, Yes, if you don't mind the typical Early Access investment of buying an incomplete in development game. HYPERCHARGE does what it sets out to do very well so far and if a Co-Op survival tower defense game is up your alley then this is the game for you. If none of the above applies to you I recommend either skipping this one or keeping an eye on it as it recieves more updates. However, you can tell easily within the first two hours if it's something you'd want to keep, giving you the option to pick it up and refund it if you don't want it."

,Recommended,523660,32645378,Posted: 22 June,all,Bwork 🐥,"EDIT: The developers speedy response made me change my mind. I will leave this review as recommended for the time being. Let's see how it progresses. My points still stand though.This MIGHT be a good game someday, but its being held back by questionable design choices.This game has batteries which powers up your turrets.Why have them at all if they're just going to spawn right next to the core?Gameplay-wise this makes the batteries completely pointless, might as well have just a regular 'press F to repair/recharge' feature.You gain credits every round, but after the first few you have enough to buy out everything, there's no upgrading or repairing. The walls are destroyed very quickly, only for you to spend 20 out of your 4000 credits to rebuild it.There are pre-placed areas where you can build. This isn't an issue in many tower defense games that does this, because they usually have a lot of them, with a variety of stuff you can build on them. This game only has a few, the only ones you can build any different structures on are the foundations (of which there aren't a lot of) and even then there are only a few turrets. This removes any and all tactical aspect to the game, and in my opinion the most fun part of tower defense games.Sanctum does what this game aims to do much better, and that game was released in 2011 and costs 8 dollars. When you pay 10 dollars you expect more, even if it is early access.This game runs on the unreal 4 engine, so it looks gorgeous, it runs smoothly and they've nailed the toy-store aesthetic."

Some things of note;The BeyBlades get stuck behind the map in Toy Aisle 1, and can be a nuisance.There was a fair bit of upgrade glitches. Sometimes an upgraded turret or bunker would disappear. Or the gun part would disappear, and it would stop functioning. Sometimes for only one player, sometimes for both players.In grampas attic, a number of waves spawned with zero enemies, leaving us locked out.I bought it to play with my roommate together. We put in a few games. It was good fun save for the above glitches that clearly weren't intended. As for some actual game design things;Turret descriptions and maybe some stats could be improved. I'm STILL not entirely sure what the shockwave turret does even after using it in game! It didn't seem terribly affective. Maybe some hard numbers like range or radius in tiles, damage dealt or a damage per second count off, something of that sort.Having the ability to crouch would be quite helpful, especially with the bunker.Enemies: For the most part, this was good. Lots of variety and interest. Maybe work on balancing the waves; the army men waves are hellish, while the robot waves are sort of a joke.I love what you guys are doing and this game is definitely one that seems fun for a quick pop on and mess around kind of thing with friends. Looking forwards to seeing it when its better polished!"

,Recommended,523660,32682124,Posted: 23 June,all,Jaypm93,"Other than the obvious problems that come with early acess games such as bugs, crashes, etc this game has a lot of potential and is fun to play even in its current state."
,Recommended,523660,34958762,Posted: 14 September,all,Historo,"This game is probably the best EA game I've ever played, for an unbeatable price tag. So much potential surrounding this team. And the developers are spot on, listening to all the feedback. Can't wait for this game to blow up in popularity, and can't wait to see what else the devs have in store for this game.Pick this game up now while it's $15 before the developers realize their incredible game is worth $30."
,Recommended,523660,33300706,Posted: 5 July,all,ChodicusPrime,"I can't say enough nice things about this game.PROS:+ Graphics are BEAUTIFUL+ Gameplay is SOLID+ Attention to Detail is incredible in the level design+ Music is EPIC (Adds so much intensity to gameplay)+ Gameplay is challenging enough, but allows for increasing of difficulty+ Huge nostalgia throughout the game+ Character customization options! I did not expect that.CONS:- Lack of people in servers (I play with friends so this doesn't bother me)- Only 3 Maps right now (but they plan to add tons more as shown on the Level Selection screen)- Few weapon options- No Melee- No grenade (But there is a Grenade Launcher so ehhh)Overall this game is fantastic. I was instantly smitten with this game. Its actually one of the few games I look forward to seeing more of. This product in its current state is TOTALLY WORTH the 14.99 asking price. Especially considering all of the potential this game has in future, I highly recommend buying this game now and getting your friends together to play."
,Recommended,523660,35166772,Posted: 23 September,all,Jig,"It's a first person tower defense game where you play action figures defending a core of some sort from hordes of other toys hellbent on its destruction. Players choose their loadout, figure out what items they're going to place where, and prep themselves for the onslaught of overpriced bits of plastic.At its core Hypercharge: Unboxed is simple fun, but can become very complex and challenging as you reach the higher waves. Some towers shoot rockets, some are machine guns, some heal you, and everything can be upgraded, just watch out for friendly fire.If you have a few friends you can talk into taking the plunge with you (it's also great if you just want a couch-coop game), then it's an easy purchase. This game is perfect as a break from more serious fare."
,Recommended,523660,34884622,Posted: 11 September,all,BREW STER,A fun and well put together wave shooter with a cool premise of toys fighting toys. coupled with some decent tower defense mechanics
,Recommended,523660,33074858,Posted: 1 July,all,Soul_Taker,"This game really hits the visuals spot on. It gives a authentic sense of actually being an Action Hero. There isn't much content if we are talking about gameplay, but the devs have made sure to state this everywhere on the steam store page. There are some neat customisation settings for your character and some cool weapon attachments, as well as freaky looking toys you have to kill!Overall, for an Early Access this is very polished, the developers are very active and they seem to be listening to their players so far. I think in time this game can be something very very amazing as long as they continue to listen to us. Keep it up devs!"

From this experience alone I have High hopes for this game as I feel the Devs really have alot of passion to look after their player base.I enjoy the game I love the fact you can customise your Character, Weapon and Turrets but it feels a little bare bones at the moment but that is to be expected being this early into the game's release.Game play I see no need to Aim Down Sights I would much prefer right mouse to just Fire my second weapon as switching weapons can be some what slow and to be honest I didnt see much of a use for ADS as the hip fire is just fine and that was with a Machine Gun. I would like the option to be able to choose which Turret to place.Art style is fantastic..enough said on thatAs of now as I said before its bare bones but a worthy investment as I really feel the Devs are going to push forward and make this game a treuly remarkable work of art.I would like to see a Development plan."

,Recommended,523660,33151756,Posted: 2 July,all,The CastAway DC,"Clearly still early days from the gameplay side. Best played with a few friends. Once they introduce more enemy & defence types to add a bit more variety, possibly even a player leveling system between each wave it may hold attention for longer periods.The Visuals are superb, better than some AAA titles. There are plenty of little jokes hidden around the levels, which you can hunt for between waves that adds a little something to the enjoyment. But a game can't rely on it's visuals alone, especially one like this.All in all great potential & I'm hopeful as more modes & features are added that this game will reach that potential. I'll be keeping an eye on its progress.Here's a link to  little vid of my first playthrough if you wish to see a sample of what the game offers right now -http://youtube.be/PYbT2ZUP820"

I saw an advertisement video of this game on a gaming channel and i thought it was a cool concept so i checked it out and decided to give it a try. Bought one for myself and my buddy. the game is an absolute blast for an early access thats not completely finished. all the devs need to do to make this game grow is add more maps, weopons and characters."

I think alot still needs to be added though, a remove tool/ upgrade tool for turrets and walls so credits are more useful. Maybe bosses through waves. I think adding a battery charger, instead of being given batteries every wave would be a cool idea. weapon stats so you actually know whats the difference between guns, plus attactments actually doing things. maybe a points system so you can unlock guns and attactments. Looking forward to more updates and can't wait to see what these guys do!"

The enemies are very unique and there is a lot of potential with this sort of art style. Wish the gmaeplay leaned more on the Sanctum 2 side where you funnel enemies and can build walls like a more traditional tower defence.
