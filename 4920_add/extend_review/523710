Currently a deal breaker....that being said, the developer seems VERY open to suggestions and making improvements! I really get the feeling that the necessary improvements will be made and that the game will continue to be expanded upon.For that reason, I will not be ""returning"" the game, as I want to support the developer, because I can see where this could  eventually be a GREAT game.I look forward to updating my review to a ""recommend"" in the near future, hopefully!"

My play space is on the minimal limit, so I find myself concentrating on ensuring i'm not about to plunge my controller weilding hand into the wall as much as combating the knights themselves.It's a credit to the game that even with that restriction it plays well.It gets tough quick, which I find is a disadvantage with less space.  I pretty well have to stand my ground, parry and jab.  I have also found the scimitar and broadsword are too short for such tactics.I would love to play this game with masses of space, but the minimal space requirement is still well worth the entry fee.  I shall be returnung to this game on a regular basis.Edit:I bust my controller:I unlocked skermish, which was great, but when dealing with multiple enemies I took to the tactic of smacking a knight's shield with my sword so they back away - past my play area.A brief check of Youtube, the purchase of a T5 Torx screwdriver, and half and hour of fiddling the controller's back in action. But......Once bitten, twice shy. I have decided that even with the minimum required space I cannot safely play this game as it is intended.It would be nice to see some refinement of single combat adversaries for us persons with limited space (or the Brits, if you prefer).I still recommend the game though, but be warned if space is minimal."
,Recommended,523710,25672454,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,jiro,"Sword Master VR is just another name for sweating all over the place Simulator. I have played this straight for 2 hours with my brother in taking turns and we already reached lvl 9 plus 5 expert medals.The gameplay is getting extremly challenging but also satisfying as you progress. Dont loose hope when fighting 4 opponents at the same time. You´ll get used to it.Balancewise i´d say the Rapier is way too strong compared to the slashing weapons. Thrusts are pretty effective but hard to land. Strike, guard, dodge all while keeping possible other knights in check. Breaking guards to get a moment of time so you can thrust forwards is a great way of taking down the bigger guys.If you are used to Swordfighting or have a hunch on how diffrent Swords should be used, you´ll find yourself in a big advantage. Neverless the game is still very challenging.Pros:- Music. The Soundtracks fully add to the envoirement and combat- Diffrent types of Swords gets you a lot of diffrent approaches on how to defeat single or multiple enemys. Reach over damage? Thrusts or Slashes? Short range versus long range? Why not try dual wielding to mix it up a bit?- Expert levels aswell as a Survival mode makes it interesting in long term- Pretty accurate hit boxes. Sometimes it feels like it could use some work but most of the times its working splendid- Intimidating models of the knights add just fine to the setting of an Arena battleCons:- Animations really could use some work- At higher levels it feels like the knights are trying to overcome one with numbers instead of technique. Its more a sort of defending against mashing instead of getting the upper hand by experience. Let them knights attack a bit faster maybe?- No replay button. Once you died thou shalt click thyself through the menu to start a match anew- I want more. More maps, more weapons, diffrent enemys, coop!The game is dirt cheap for what it is. Take the warning and get pets, kids or whatnot out of your room. And if you are any sort of interested in melee fights. Get this game. You wont be dissapointed."

Though, the store page does not mention any ""Early Access"" like I'd hope to believe, I'll keep that in mind.Therefore, let me get down to the principles of the game.Basically, you start out with a single sword, and you progress through levels in which you parttake in combat against AI enemies with armor, shields, and swords. It obviously gets harder as you get through, setting up for a breath of relief as you finish that last level.However fun it appears at first, the further you get in, the more you notice just how terribly horrible the hit detection is--how utterly frustrating it is to try and hit an enemy.Your sword will constantly skip out on hitting a specific part of their body and just hit the armor. Your sword will also give multiple hits at once if you repeatedly stab back and forth with your weapon--even if it's still inside the enemy.Maybe it's just my personal experience from it, but the swordplay in this game is nothing more than hope that you don't register hitting their armor and try not to hit your bedroom walls--even though the enemies linger outside of it at all times.I do not recommend to anyone who's ever been frustrated with bugs in games."

I'm exhausted!"" reviews from the Kool-Aid gulping wide eyed, fan boy types. They would have fun dancing around their bedrooms waving a toilet brush with a bucket on their heads shouting ""Take that foul demon!""I gave this game the benefit of the doubt, watching the dev videos for a few months and reserving my opinion until trying it. Unfortunatley it plays just like it looks and it looks a little disjointed. I get the feeling these are store bought art assets. This results in a jarring mix in the quality of models, textures and animations so it feels more like a tech demo rather than a finished product.Regarding gameplay the enemy characters hover just outside the bounds of the chaperone which means of you are going to be swinging your controller full speed (as it requires you to do) at them.  The potential for controller smashing and loved one assaulting is terrifyingly high. Games like ""Thrill of the fight"" handle this style of close quarters combat much better.A Vive labour of love that suffers from the problems of developing with limited outside input.Maybe following the ""QuiVr"" dev model of community testing through development would have helped iron out the gameplay kinks. It is however well priced and robustly coded, the art and more importantly gameplay on offer, are not to my taste."
76561198081937081,Recommended,523710,26394147,"Posted: 2 November, 2016",all,EmperorNorton,"LOVE THIS GAME!!! Before my Achilles gave out I used to love fencing, so I'm always excited to try another sword combat game in VR. While no game can compare to actual fencing, this one really feels like sword fighting. Yes, the AI is simple, but having multiple opponents circling you adds enough difficulty to make up for that once you get to expert level. Also, on expert level this is the best game for exercise I've yet played. Holoball and Holopoint are right up there too, but this one beats them for getting my heart rate going.I'll compare this to my second favorite sword combat VR game, Vanishing Realms (With the new update that gives you Warriors Challenge Hard Mode). The sword combat in Vanishing realms is pattern based, like the original (I'm dating myself here) Prince of Persia, or Prince of Persia Classic on the Xbox 360. I really enjoy it, but your opponents just stand there for the most part. If the opponents moved around you more, like they do in Sword Master, then I would have to consider that my favorite sword game because the patterns are more complex and some of the attacks are faster.To the developer:I would like a mode where the opponents don't forecast their attacks so much, and that attack is faster. This might up the challenge without having to have 3 guys surrounding you.Also, I would love to see a duelist mode that was more like fencing. To avoid the challenge of making a sword game work in a situation where you cannot apply force to the player’s hand when their sword is supposed to be deflected you could use a right-of-way convention like what is used in foil and saber fencing. The first one to begin an attack gains the right-of-way and, if they land the hit, will score if the opponent dose not parry. Parrying gives the opponent the right of way. The player having lost the right-of-way can no longer score even if they land the hit unless they first regain the right-of-way. Missing with an attack also causes you to lose the right-of-way. So, if your attack falls short your opponent can immediately attack and will score even if you strike again and you both hit at the same time. Not sure how do-able it would be to program this but I would love to see something like this in a sword game."

However, I hate seeing a game's reputation dragged down by negative reviews from players who played less than half an hour. Honestly, the game does have some hit box issues and weapon balance needs to be addressed. The dev has said as much, and stated he's working on it.With that out of the way, the game is more than worth its price tag. Nothing in VR has gotten my heart racing like trying to hold off three dual wielding opponents with a rapier.

Be prepared to sweat and inch your way through the numorus stages, but don't let the difficulty discourage you. Finishing a stage feels fantastic and with each enemy beaten, you'll feel that much better as a VR Swordsman.The sword fighting mechanics are pretty solid, but certainly not 1:1 with real life. They're very close however. The animations give you a good window of prediction and the reactionary animations of the enemies are pretty realistic and don't feel canned.It's also worth adding that I have a smaller than average playspace and while I can get away with playing this, it can be difficult at times. If you have a small playspace, make sure to stand where you can swing with your arm extended all around you without hitting anything. If you can do that, you should be alright as long as you don't walk much. Just be careful because you can really get lost in this experience."

It's extremely rewarding to see youself skill up to the point where enemies that used to stress you out can be dispatched with a few casual flicks and a lunge. Unlocking new swords and playing with them gives the game high replay value, especially once you get duel weilding and can mess with lots of combos (10/10 would bring knives to a sword fight again).There are a lot of different ways to crack the enemy, from massive chops with a heavy sword till they stagger to quick oppertunistic jabs with a rapier. I found myself lunging, ducking and doing whatever the neo backwards lean is called. Getting surrounded by 3 enemies while cowering behind a shield is an experience you just have to try.As a bonus this game is quite enjoyable to spectate/take turns with, the 3rd person camera view for mirrored screen allows spectators to call out warnings (say for an enemy behind you) while still fitting with the overall theme of the game/not breaking the fourth wall too hard.I'm currently sore all over from playing this and honestly haven't had this much fun since I was a kid, it's not quite as polished as say vanishing realms or space pirate trainer but in my opinion is a lot more enjoyable that SPT. If you're looking for nonstop, sweat pouring off you action that rewards real player skill check this game out.Would shout ""are you not entertained"" again."

That's what this game delivers on. There's no plot or story here; this is nothing but arena matches. The art style isn't super high quality, but that doesn't matter.What does matter is the way you play this game. The sword physics feel real. Your playing area is limited and you have to wait for an enemy to come close enough before you swing at them. Some have shields. They have armour, and you can't hit their armour or your slice won't register. The game has different weapons with different stats, and depending on your fighting style, some will be more effective than others.If you need a workout and you like swordplay, this is a very solid game, especially for its asking price. I keep coming back to this game more than any other VR game.(the skeleton spectators are ridiculous, though - I don't know what the dev was thinking)"

,Not Recommended,523710,30406861,Posted: 9 March,all,TheNarwhal,"In short, it's really unpolished. The enemies are cartoonishly large, and get up in your face to make up for how incredibly tiny the player sword is, which makes it impossible to see anything or prepare for an enemy attack. This renders the game basically unplayable.To expand on that, the enemies are ""cartoonishly large"" because they're probably orcs or whatever the dev wants to call them. They do get up in your face, and the bigger ones with huge tower shields will put those right in your face to completely obstruct your view. I do believe it's because if they stood much further away, you could not reach them with the tiny sword you're given. While the swords you're given are realistically sized, it leaves you at a disadvantage when the enemy is armed up with 4+ foot long blades and shields as big as they are. Just lengthening the sword and keeping the AI at a slight distance would fix the entire problem and get me to cancel my refund.Another good addition would be movement of any kind. It's upsetting to be stuck in one place constantly, especially since this leads to me moving in the real world and smacking into every wall in my room. Movement would fix that for players like me whom don't get motion sick often.Until further notice, I cannot recommend this game to anyone questioning it.(For the record, I have about 2.6m x 2.2m of space.)"
,Not Recommended,523710,33252568,Posted: 4 July,all,Addicted Beast,"Rating: 4/10 (Slightly Below Average)Recommended: NoWith a fair selection of several different weapons (which have special stats to them which improve certain aspects of their use) and shields ranging from decorative to fully protective, the game certainly offers a nice bit of choice when it comes to the player choosing what weapon they want to play with against waves of AI opponents.However, the AI opponents themselves are lackluster: they use animations instead of physics, meaning there's no realistic feedback when it comes to combat. You swing your sword and clash blades, and the AI blade will either continue, or bounce back the exact same way every time. The disconnect between your real-life motions and in-game effect is such that Sword Master VR really doesn't compare to certain other VR fighting games. The AI will continue to use these animations, meaning their weapons will clip through you, or your own weapon, and generally make it feel like you're fighting ghosts rather than actual opponents. This is the consequence of using full-body animations versus physics-based animations when it comes to Virtual Reality.Because of the lackluster combat mechanics, the lack of level variation, and a lack of distinct enemy types (three variations with gradually larger weapons), Sword Master VR doesn't get a recommendation from me. The most I can say is that for the short while I've played it over the past few months, I've enjoyed it for about twenty minutes, before losing interest.Much credit goes to the developers at Master Indie for building the game however, and I definitely hope that they continue making VR games. Based on Sword Master VR's quality and presentation, I think they have great potential to continue creating fun content, and I look forward to seeing games by them in the future."

,Recommended,523710,31032672,Posted: 8 April,all,Micah,"After playing the game daily for a while I'm editing this review a bit.  While I am still giving it a thumbs up, it is mainly because the price is fairly low and there 90% of VR games aren't very interactive.  I would say this game qualifies as Early Access as it does not feel like it is finished, yet the developer appears to have completely dropped the project and moved on to a new (totally unrelated) project.  It is frustrating because the game really has a _lot_of potential, but there are a few little problems that really need to be solved to make the end-game less frustrating.Its a million little things that cause the end-game to be frustrating:* enemies can walk through you* you can't push enemies away at all so there is no mechanism for controlling the field* the enemies sometimes swing their swords through their own body and hit you from an angle you can't see coming* sometimes you'll get hit and the post-hit freeze frame shows a sword clearly going straight through the middle of your shield* the enemies will sometimes just run 3 circles around you, which is really frustrating without a wireless headset* the textures on the models aren't particularly clear on where exactly you can hit enemies and deal damage* it is unclear when your blow was deflected by armor/sword/shield, sometimes it feels like your strike was dead on but no damage occurs.I still use the game as part of my daily workout, but now that I'm at Legendary difficulty I suspect I'm going to reach a point of being too frustrated to continue soon.  I really do enjoy the challenge of the difficulty level, but the above things make it feel like I can't progress anymore because the random bugs hit frequently enough to make it so it is very hard to get through an entire level without running into one of them that gets you killed (legendary difficulty is one-hit-kill against player).I am _really_ hoping a AAA title uses this game as the basis for an improved version.  I really think there is a ton of potential here and would love to see it fleshed out.  Even if the game stays as is with regards to ""content"" I would be happy with it if they just fixed some of the remaining quirks.-- ORIGINAL REVIEW --This is going to compete with Holopoint for fun fitness games.  It has a variety of weapons to master and the game keeps you moving.  If you are looking for a story based game with a beginning, middle and end, this is not it.

Highly recommended if you are looking to break a sweat while have fun doing it.Cons:1. Since you are required to swing weapons at high speed, if your playing area is very small, or if it's surrounded by hard walls or fragile items, you will want to be extra careful. Consider turning on one of the more invasive chaperone.2. The enemies' animation quality is not very good. More realistic and varied animations would add to the immersion.Pros:1. Although the weapon selection is not huge, the characteristics of different weapons promote very different strategies and playstyles.2. At higher difficulties, precision becomes essential to success - the speed and angle of the strikes are essential. Real swordfighting tips such as avoiding overswings also surprisingly become relevant.3. As mentioned early, really breaks quite a sweat, and time passes fast while doing it."

It has not alot to do with actual sword fighting and i guess it's a cool agility game but there's almost no content here.One thing that's worth mentioning is that the videos depict it like it matters wether you swing your sword in a ""realistic"" slow speed, i didn't see that at all in the game, you can be jerky and quick like blade runner it doesnt matter."

I guess they said that because it has swords and skeletons in it...One of the things I LOVE about the prospect of swordplay in VR is that, as someone that practices HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) myself, I'm experienced in the mechanics of swordplay. Knowing how to defend, proper stances and attack routines, knowing how to simultaneously defend and attack in a single motion.This game pretends to take these concepts into account, but does so very poorly. The enemies leave themselves wide open, yet even a clean cut to the undefended abdomen usually passes right through the enemy's body, or they'll somehow parry attacks that came nowhere near their shield or sword. Meanwhile, enemies will routinely step outside of the play area and wait for you to attack, which becomes more of an issue when there are two of them. It makes it feel as if the developers didn't anticipate people playing this game inside of a house.A good idea, but very, very poorly executed. Poor hit detection, annoying AI, and sub-par performance all plague this game. Even at $10, it's too expensive, because there are a lot of VR titles out there at that price that are far superior."
,Not Recommended,523710,30328543,Posted: 4 March,all,Cabby,"You know what?  No.  I’m sick of thisThe HTC Vive came out in April of last year.  Development kits came out before then to give important community members/developers an idea of whats possible with the technology.  This game came out in early access 5 months after the official HTC Vive release.We should not be seeing this kind of trashy tech demo’s at a price of $10 anymore.  The unity personal splash screen is here, it looks to be using store assets(bad ones at that, I feel like I’m in VR Quake 2 style graphics here.), and is even more basic than Wii Sports Resorts sword fighting on the Nintendo Wii, which came out back in 2009.  Ill admit that isn’t a fair comparison due to the devs involved, but Im saying I wouldn’t spend $10 on that either, let alone this.  This should have been free.  I am noticing a lot of shovelware/paid tech demo releases in VR; you know what it reminds me of?  The video game crash of 1983.  Just a truck load of games of varying(mostly crap) quality with no assurance that your getting what you paid for.  If this keeps up, VR is gonna pass away as a fad.As far as the game itself, I’ve already mentioned poor looking graphics.  The assets are used repeatedly throughout the game.  I could probably count the number of available models on my fingers(excluding the individual player sword/shields, which have been added over time and do nothing really).  The sword fighting is very simplistic, involving wagging your blade in the general undefended spots of your enemy and hovering your blade in front of an attack, no matter how impossible it would be to actually defend with your chosen stance.   Blades seem to act instantaneous, polarized magnets when clashing.  They fly far off with no respect to strength of a swing.  That might be acceptable if you are looking for an arcade style experience, but it gets worse.  The animations of your opponents will change drastically to try and mix you up when you try and defend.  They can go from preparing a tall vertical slice to an awkward spin attack in an instant.  It would almost be comical if it wasn’t obvious this was meant to make them more difficult because the dev couldn’t make an intelligent AI.  It doesn’t feel impressive to fight these strange moving grunts, and that’s unacceptable whether you are going for realistic or arcade style gameplay.This is the third game I have requested a refund on steam for; the 2nd one was also a VR cash grab.  PS: Don’t act like I’m not supporting VR by refunding this/not buying trash VR games.  I already bought the hardware.  A decent developer isn’t going to judge the success of his game on how these unity cash grabs are doing.  They might raise an eyebrow if that’s all that shows up here though."

There are difficulties that span the spectrum, and although the waves aren't as dynamic as I'd like, the mechanics are immensely satisfying. One of the biggest reasons I got a Vive was for sword combat, and this is the best game out there so far for pure sword/shield mechanics. Pretty good for an indie dev.Short list of pros + cons.Pros:+Satisfying sword/shield mechanics+Great range of difficulties+Interesting and broad weapon selection (with serious effects on how your gameplay will be)+Awesome viewing options for those not in the HMD - spectators can properly spectate instead of just seeing what the player seesCons:-Shields do have cosmetic variety but very little in the way of real practical differences? (Of course, we can't make a Vive controller heavier, so gameplay difference is hard to implement faithfully)-Enemy moveset is fairly limited. I'd love to see more dynamic enemies and more challenging 1-on-1's, but currently difficulty is very much based on how much armor your foes have and how many of them there are. Did anyone else grow up watching Highlander and want epic swordfights? This feels like the game that can do it.-Single arena, no change of scenery. If Stolen Steel didn't suck, it'd be more like this game but with good movement and other gameplay mechanics-No word from the dev since Dec 2016, which worries me that this game won't be updatedWould I buy it even though I imagine it won't be updated?

Very disappointed at how incomplete this feels and how I feel totally misled by the trailers. There are number of things wrong with this and i'l try and cover them here. Ultimately it feels like a Wii sword game where you just flail at the right time to win.1. OMG the hitboxes. These are completely messed up and ultimately what makes the game feel like a Wii sword game.... The shield has a hitbox the size of his mom. It doesn't matter how far you reach around you will most likely hear the clank of the shield even though you are no where near it. I'm not sure why they even have feet because 1 out of 4 times will it actually even register your hit (same with his back and really most all of him).2. Not accuracy but timing. It's not about how accurate you are but WHEN you swing. If you don't wait for his shield to go down then why swing at all. You can try and be agile and swing under it but while your sword will perfecly cleve through his body you will either hear the clang of the shield or nothing will register. This is infuriating as you will feel you are robbed time and time again!!! I'd say it registered a hit 25% of the time when I carefully planned and swung and saw my sword cleave a major body part in two.... no damage (oh and by the way now you are vulnerable and his sword has touched you accidently and hurt you since he clipped into your body)3.

It does require full rotation and didn't work great with rift cameras in the middle of 2 adjacent walls, but in 2 opposite corners it works flawlessly."

Better collision, and less stupid scenarios where you have 3 people surrounding you (This would be fine if it was Full-Dive VR, but due to how clunky our current VR Is, it's basically a fight against your cable and your surroundings to even turn around rather then those 3 guys you're trying to perfect strike but fail to understand how to properly land one) this game would be perfect, oh and a bigger map. If you can even call this a ""map"".If you used this fighting and implemented it into a decent stat point traditional RPG, it'd be perfect.Also different opponents with different fighting styles would be nice. Wouldn't it be nice to fight a cat warrior who keeps jumping around and stuff in really flashy ways, or a huuuuge muscly tank guy.A skilled Swordsman.A puny woman with a dagger..Etc.. Not just a bunch of masked big dudes that don't even get cut and just die out of bleeding after hitting them enough times."

With new shield and faster enemy now it's completely a new game and a must for anyone who are interested in combat game. This game is released in October and still the best combat game in VR.Just ignore the last two level and have some fun. The level design in late level gets ugly, and glitch become intolerable."

It's not the prettiest girl at the dance nor is it the most sophisticated, but the clean simplicity and physicality of this game makes it a must have and must play. It is now part of my exercise routine and any chance I have to play VR starts or ends with this game and results in getting a good workout and having a great time."

It's rare that I play and do not end up covered in sweat. I do have a problem tangling the cord and yanking out the cables from time to time, and I'm trying to learn how to keep in mind I'm really not in a medieval arena with huge knights and double sword wielding ninjas trying to slice me up! Novice levels are pretty easy, but when you get to 3 on 1, you really have to operate at a high level of intensity to stay alive and conquer. This is the only game I have ever played that has inspired me to raise both hands in the air (holding swords masked as controllers) and scream, ""YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!"" at the top of my lungs. My neighbors think I'm insane lol"

Pulled my VR cord out from the computer a couple of times.
