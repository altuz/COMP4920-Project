Especially after we gave them a second and / or 3rd chance after the messed up Em5. Speaking about Em5. This is in fact the same Game. And also the same Game as Em 2016.You wonder where to find them? You wont. Because (like mentioned before) its the same game and the reviews where that horrible, best they could do, was remove that games from the store.Em5 and therefore also this part, is full of bugs. Horrible Game Handling. Worthless Multiplayer experience.If you want to play a good Emergency Game. Do your homework and find that em4 is the best part they ever made. Maybe if you want you could try Em2014, it was kind of ok too. After that. It went straight down to♥♥♥♥♥♥But think twice if you really want to support this developer in any kind. Because the ripoff they practice, by releasing the same game for like twice a year, requires for some statement from your site and should not go unpunished. For me this was the last chance I gave them. I will refund immediately and never buy their crap again. RIP Sixteen Tons.And good Luck releasing this Game again as Em6 in Summer 2017. And again as Em2018 later this year.So Embarassing."

Otherwise, the game is borderline sadistic:1) You can get groups of civilians gathering in front of your base blocking your vehicles, with no way to arrest or otherwise dispose of them. The environment is full of objects that block paths and cannot be removed (e.g. intact cars), but which will delay your vehicles2) Abysmal pathfinding. Paramedics will take a 150m detour instead of just walking towards the front of their vehicle and you should allow several hours if two paramedics ever meet on a football field3) Firefighters pick the worst hydrants, and switch at least opportune times. I guess the old system where the player had choices was too hard to implement.4) Campaign missions are grouped for no good reason, so you better make sure that you can play for a couple of hours at a time. If you get unlucky and a group of civilians spawns inside a radiation cloud then you'll just have to replay the first hour of the mission."

However, this game is complete trash so dont buy it.Reasons:1. the 2017 version has the same map of emergency 5 and emergency 2016. All they did was adding new scenarios to the already exsisting map, No new veichles no new options. Hardly a ""new"" game. More like an update.2. It's expensive, at 44$3. Most important. The graphics of this game has not improved for years, and the mechanics of your units are complete trash. They move ridiculously slow and inefficient. And the bugs oh boi don't get me started. I failed missions over and over again just becuz of the STUPID NPC AI unit mechanics, or bugs and the ppl just die.This game is what I call unplayable, just because of how stupid the mechanics of the game are.Do not buy this game.The missions are also kinda similar and repetative.And the cut scenes? Oh boi, great concept, with pre2000 graphics.I understand that if you like thie concept you are urged to purchase this game, just like myself, but then once you start playing it, the mechanics will kill you and you will just throw this game aside. Go watch some youtube videos of the mechanics first. I'm sure you'll agree"

,Recommended,524110,32829211,Posted: 26 June,all,SykoFerret,"Okay, It mostly doesn't suck. Yes, it's a niche genre from a less than reputable publisher, that's just where they end up. As a long time player of the franchise, there have always been bugs (as long as computers have existed). I do enjoy playing the game though, and it runs just fine @ max setting on my steam machine.Good:- Graphics are significantly improved over the older EM games.- Controls, while sluggish, are still less so than previous iterations.- I was aware it's the same game engine, as most games are (I don't see everyone hating on CS, or C&C, or CoD for the same thing... Not to mention EVERY sports game ever made...) They maintained the experience and gameplay I have come to love and expect, while still adding content and missions.- Mod support! This is a game changer, when the developer allows you to create your own content, missions, and worlds.Bad:- Still very buggy, I take it as a casual game, and work through the bugs, or simply restrt the mission. Frreplay can really get messed up after a few hours, where vehicles start stacking up, however clicking on the unit, telling it to move, and then requesting return to HQ, provides a good workaround, as the vehicle will despawn where it sits if it cannot path.- AI, and pathing is atrocious, but again when pathing in games it is worth noting the traveling salesman, so if you think you can do better; mods are encouraged, and I implore you to make a better pathfinding algortihm, and fix google and ALL maps in existence ;)- The game can be monotonous, or overly challenging, and repetitious in the execution of tasks. There is alot of organizing units, and strategizing in realtime involved. Then a trains crashes, and tons of people die, because of the crime spree. I don't see this need to prioritize incidents, nor the repetitious execution as a negative. Yet I feel that most will.Ugly:- Some things just don't fit in, I detest the revamped look for the new units as compared to the older games. The models simply felt more authentic, whereas they look more like toys rendered in the newer game. Other models and objects were directly ported and stand out. Some models and animations are rough, but they work as they should, and seem optimized enough for a PC to handle all oif the stuff going on (which is ALOT for a game engine to process track and render.)- My steam machine runs the game very well on max settings, however load times are still long even from SSD, there is soem moderate load in lag. And general lag when there is ALOT going on. These are not issues when I turn down AF, but the input lag, and unit response lag is sluggish, yet still marginally better than previous EM iterations.TL:DRIt's a good casual, emergency response simulator. Can be buggy, monotonous, and repetitive, but the variance in tasks, and dynamic events make it worthwhile for the experience. If you enjoy this kind of game it will likely be a good addition to your collection on steam sale. If you aren't into micromanagement of units, and expect to be able to solve every problem every time with no mistakes; this game is probably not for you."

76561198067198869,Recommended,524110,29502868,Posted: 26 January,all,Monkey Mouth,"Overall, it's quite a good game and fairly realistic in terms of variety of incidences you have to deal with, however I think it could be improved in 3 main areas.Most importantly, I think there should be more automation. I know there is an option for it, however it's pretty useless as units remain in their vehicle after arriving on scene and usually just stand with the patient of criminals after having dealt with them.Secondly, I think there should be modes to free play. For example: Harcore mode has mass shootings, major fires, bombs and train crashes all the time. General mode should have a mixture of all. Soft mode should have mainly minor RTAs and medical emergencies. Maybe also a ""speed"" settings too so you can set how frequent and how many incidences you can deal with at once.Lastly, I think the Ambulance should come with an Emergency Doctor as it would be more realistic and less annoying having to send 2 units for 1 minor incident.Other than that, it's a pretty easy and fun game that I would recommend to anyone who likes mangement-based games.7/10."

Emergency 2017 I couldn't even tell you.5, while repetitive, actually seems a bit like your managing emergency services. There's a decent variety of missions, and no real story. You start out with some equipment and pretty much free play until you have enough credits to buy new equipment. After you buy all of it, a large scale op starts. Generally they use the new equipment that you have just bought.Some minor spoilers here. 2016 the first mission is back in the black plague era. Not exactly what I bought the game for, but whatever. Then after that if you play the campaign, it's just mission after mission. If you need new equipment, the narrator just mentions it at the start. I didn't like that as much as the previous years way of doing things, but whatever. Seemed like  a lot of the missions were preventing spread of a modern day plague, and didn't have as much variety as the previous installment.2017, I'll admit I haven't played much of yet. I can't seem get past the first level, which is again set in old times. This time it's set back when they were burning witches at the stake. I might be encountering a bug that keeps failing me, but I'm not sure. Again, not what I bought the game to play. I'm gonna put this game away for a while, and maybe come back to it.Overall, I recommend this game to people, mostly because you're getting three games in one. I've got 12.5 on this one, which was beating the last 2 large scale ops of Emergency 5 and all of 2016. I have an additional 6 hours for the first part of Emergency 5 which I played before 2017 came out. 18.5 hours so far, for 40 bucks isn't too bad. I imagine if I play the rest of 2017, than I'll have up around 25-26 hours. That, to me, is worth the money."

,Recommended,524110,34114724,Posted: 8 August,all,marcusrobertson,I bought this game for 14.99 and it was well worth it. At the very least you can think of this game as a graphical improvement on the previous emergency 4 game.I havn't encountered any of the bugs reported by other users and I've actually noticed that the pathfinding and basic ai has been improved upon. Really the only problem with this game that I can see is that the modding scene isn't even close to what it was and is for emergency 4.If you enjoy games where you play/manage first responders then I would highly reccomend gettiing this game but only on sale it's not worth 50- 60 bucks.

I'd love to see a group working together without the need to click on everything all the time. Moving units individually whereas in reality people would just do what they are trained to do. Sure I could pause the game and go full micromanagement, but that isn't fun to me.So the virdict for me is, Emergency needs to not release the same game 10 times over, it's just not worth it and it makes people lose interest in the title. You need something really new with better depth and immersion to it.An FPS game might provide this. Command and Control is hard to do with AI I understand."

My frustration level about rescuing everyone that I had to but then realize that the Missions Log still show me that I had to save someone that I had already saved and therefore being listed as rescued made me already more then once just quit the Game and do something else.Conclusion:Emergency 2017 could have been great game and a fresh restart for the hole franchise but seeing the same mistakes getting repeated over and over again since the last couple of years I'm done with telling the Developer what has to be fixed and instead will just leave the following rating since the times of hoping that this franchise will improve are at least for myself over and so my final rating is as following:Thumbs DownThat´s it.

I played through the game now, and this top paragraph is added after finishing the game. The rest of the review was written about half-way in. So, in short, I will tell you this: You will be required to use every single tool you have in your arsenal in almost all of the missions. There are almost no cases, in which you don't have to arrest armed terrorists and (spoiler) that number goes up to 27 in one case. Bombs will be dirty. Fires will be laid and distractions created. I had one crash through the entire campaign and while I still think the path finding problems are still not where they should be, I always could find an acceptable way of micro-managing the crap out of my people without too much frustration. You learn what you can let the AI do on it's own and you only do the necessary things. High efficiency is needed in this campaign. It's hard, it features police until you ears bleed and there's tons of victims and fires. Emergency at it's best, while the theme could have been a little bit more disaster focused. I'm happy to say, that there was no flood mission! I don't like flood missions.----- original review starts below:If you likes Emergency 2016, want to beat up aggressive anti-islam protestors, then save your town from terrorists crashing a boat into your harbour and then foiling terrorist weapon deals in Hamburg and thaw the plans of terrorists in Munich.Well, if 2017 is gonna be the way these guys imagine it, we will yearn for 2016.The game should really only be bought with the 85% discount you get for owning emergency 5 and 2016, which I got cheap from a third party, even though they regularly enter into discount programs on Steam.It's a great mission pack for 6€ , offering difficult new challenges and some easier ones, too.

AI is *not* dumb, in fact, they actually do things on their own if left unattended, e.g. firefighters equipped with a hose will connect to a hydrant and start putting water on the fire or medics will put patients on their gurneys and back in the ambulance without being prompted.  This is all very helpful when you're busy with bigger things or when you have a multiple patient scene to manage.  I have a feeling most people's negative reviews stem from the difficulty of the game and therefore, them trying to find as many things wrong with it as possible.  This is not a game you can just sit down and master right away.  I've been playing games from the Emergency series for years and I still have to repeat some missions.  If you don't like the idea of stress while playing a game, this isn't for you, but if you enjoy multi-tasking to the ""n""th degree, you will enjoy this.  What's great about it, is it's so flexible.  There's so many ways to accomplish the same task.

You basically work for the city and control emergency vehicles/staff of all types. The game is isometric and plays well. The pathfinding can be blocked, but you can easily move vehicles to correct the issue.The tutorial is great, it helped me understand how to play this game.The graphics and stability are great and I have had no issues.My suggestion:Unless I missed it, one thing I would like to have added to the game, is a warning alert letting me know that all of my workers are not in their vehicles when I press the button to return to headquarters. There have been several times that I have left employees stranded and I didn't even know it, and found it extremely time consuming to get them back to headquarters. Another idea would be to have a taxi service pick up and drop off a lost employee--this could also be charged to your credits.Other than that, I have to say, I really enjoyed this game.Recommended!"

The AI in the game isn't programmed the greatest. Most of the missions I failed was because you have to instruct every single firefighter, paramedic, and doctor every single thing you want them to do with nearly no automated processes. In real life, a group of firefighters pulling up to a car accident would grab the jaws of life, or for a fire a set of hoses. In this game, you must do this yourself. I've caught the doctors checking patients by themselves on a few occasions, but not enough to make a difference. It's a great game, but with the repetitive actions, it makes the game monotonous and kinda ruins the fun."

I picked this game up for around 13 dollars when it was 66 percent off. I am refunding it because the animations are terrible and the online is dead. This game should be under 10 dollars. I don't recommend this game unless you can get it for under 10 dollars.

This is a really nice addition to the game, and the latest free dlc patch also improved the game. New misssions, improved freeplay, new units etc. What more could we want? The fact that the developers are still working on it is awesome, and i cant wait for next pacth/dlc or maybe even EM2018?Lets hope this kicks of a new era in EM modding, please check out KillerConstis minimod, either on the German or English forums.If you like this game or have played previously Emergency series, please buy it, enjoy it and write a positive review so that the developers continue to improve this game.Have a nice day, and see you in multiplayer!"
