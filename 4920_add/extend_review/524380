Actually caused me some lower back pain from picking the same rocks up over and over again... you spend a lot of time picking stuff up-tutorial needs some work... I still dont understand how to smelt iron properly. I think they changed the mechanic recently-dev blog on youtube is partly deleted for some reasonThe Good-Best graphics I've seen in VR so far of this style-Its refreshing to assume I will monitor myself for motionsickness rather then limit the way I can move around. Takes some getting use to but its actually a lot more immersive then other games I've played-Something strangly addictve about collecting resources-Friendly skeleton-Loads of potentialThis is the 1st game I've played on Vive that feels like its inpireing to be the kind of game I want VR to have instead of a pay to play tech demo. Early access means theres limited game play, but I'm actually quite excited to be involved in this one.to devs : Please fix the cart... and thanks for working so hard on this one."

However, if skeleton puns don't tickle your funny bone then this is the beginning of what I anticipate to be a revolutionary experience in survival sandbox games.  It's being marketed as the first VR Surival experience built for VR from the ground up and it shows.  Things like mining/logging/crafting/combat all have a much more visceral feel to them than Vivecraft which feels like Minecraft shoehorned into VR.  Not to mention they're taking extra care to make sure in game movement melds seemlessly in with the rest of the experience.  You aren't limited to standard teleportation or gliding around, you have both options.  Additionally they have extra customizable features such as darkened field of view to help combat motion sickness as well as the option to adjust your ""walk"" speed (something I think all VR games with walk movement should incorporate).  The game itself is beautiful by VR standards and has a realisitc medival hamlet style to the items and buildings.  I built a cart and pulled it out into the forrest and then mined and logged until it was literally overflowing with resources...such that some items would fall out as my cart trumbled back to town, I'd stop and load them back in only to have them roll back out again, before finally saying ""heck with it"" and going home with a (still) heaping cartload of resources.As to whether you should purchase this game or not.  Well it's early access and right now there doesn't appear to be much to do outside of fiddling around with the basic resource gathering, bow hunting, smelting, and blacksmithing.  There's no health or hunger yet.  So far as I can tell there's no way to ""die"" either.  So there's nothing to ""survive"" at this point in development.  However if you decide not to buy it, I would still add it to  your wishlist and follow it on Steam.  It's definitely a title you'll want to pay attention to.*edit* Many reviews are pointing out how frustrating resource gathering and the cart is.  Since many of these reviews the devs have incorperated A) a basket which holds a limited amount of resources...good for scooping up items off the ground and delivering them to your cart which can hold a substantial amount of resources.  B) The devs have modified the item physics in carts to effectively ""meld"" to eachother once they come to a rest after being placed in the cart.  So while overfilling your cart can still cause things to fall out, losing items to bumps in the terrain should not be a significant issue.If you do purchase the game, the skeleton guide is very unhelpful when you get to slow smelter and you can save yourself some frustration by looking up the smelting guide posted on the Yore VR forums."

I went into the menu and changed it to Ultra and everything was super crisp. I did notice though that when I went into the main open world, it changed my graphics, so I just went in and reset it and was good to go.Love the friendly skeleton and chopping wood. The cart gave me some issues at first, but I appreciate that its like real life and if you run into a tree, the wood flies out. Note to self- avoid trees :) From what I've read, the devs are a small team and since it's an indie title, there are some hiccups for sure, but there is also a lot of promise of what's to come.The smelter was so cool and I felt like I was getting a work out in, bending over to load in the coal and ore. It's definitely a work in progress, but for Early Access the pieces of the puzzle are there. I also appreciate that the devs are being active with the community and working fast to fix some of the known issues.I'm patiently waiting for more features, but am happy to keep working hard to unlock that Practice Forge."

It is as good as other early access VR titles so far, and it is not a wave shooter to boot. I am interested in the way they are attempting to represent crafting from the medieval period by talking with experts on the subject. This game has a lot of potential."

,Recommended,524380,26230676,"Posted: 26 October, 2016",all,Wolfret D. Caigan,"(Review for initial Early Access build)An interesting and fun game with a lot of promise. It's one that straddles the line for me on whether to recommend or not.There is some stuff to do in the game already. It's an open area, letting you explore, gather materials, smelt ore, build a couple buildings, etc. There is a cart you can pull around to hold your resources which I found a fairly nice concept.The variety of movement options is nice, as well as the inclusion of some comfort options.The few downsides : there is no personal inventory yet, managing resources involves loading up your cart with the items, and hoping that the physics don't do something silly. The physics doesn't go wacky like, say, bioshock, but more that 'item was pushed through bottom of cart on accident. It usualy happens with the tools(which reappear back at your house if you lose them, thankfully!). Plus resources can slide off the front or back if you are jostling the cart too much with sharp turns and over bumps in the ground.What pushes this into 'recommend' is how active the dev is, communicating with the community, regular devlogs, etc."

I will say however that I tried the highly unstable but more updated version of this alpha you can switch to via steams game properties and while entirely unplayable I did see that many of the core mechanics I found unwieldy had at least some attempt (even if early and still not functional) to take them in exactly the direction it seemed like they should be taken.After completing what there is to complete I think this has a massive amount of potential. Even though it is little more than a tech demo right now that only just barely showcases some of what the developer plans to add I did find I enjoyed myself. If the developer sticks to it and manages to execute things correctly I think this could become a really solid addition to the genre.

There's already a lot to do, you can gather, smelt, build, live the basic life of a villager. I feel there aren't enough games out there like this concept, and it's really nice to have something like this to fall back on when I just want to have a more relaxing gameplay experience.Having played several early access games, this is one of the ones that shows a lot of promise. There are active developers and an active community base. The foundation this game is laid on is solid and fun and I look forward to more!"

If thats not for you, maybe wait a bit before downloading, since this is currently early access. That being said, That's part of the ride for me. I went through it with Rust, from the rough early days, watching it get more and more refined as time passed, And I know the same thing is going to happen here. Graphics look great, tons of potential, and I think it's only going to get better as they address issues, smooth out animations, add more content, etc. Get it today or get it a year from now, but either way, give it a try."

,Not Recommended,524380,26441332,"Posted: 5 November, 2016",all,Shadow,"https://youtu.be/-GTMDvihOwoThis is going to be a long one...Rereviewing the game as of version 3.9.2.Lets tackle the elephant in the room first off. Save games were reset again. This game requires a considerable amount of effort to achieve even small things. There's a trade off on work vs sense of accomplishment. Not complaining about that. I like that sense of accomplishment. What I'm upset about is the loss of save data.It's an EA title. Wipes will happen. They suck but are sometimes necessary. I will say that it does impact the review of the current state of the game. It's hard to recommend a game like this when their gameplay will be reset every month or so.Ok, on to locomotion. There are a lot of options here but it ends up being somewhat complicated to get things set up the way you want. Eventually I can get Onward style locomotion on the left controller but it takes a minute or two of finagling it.A simpler interface would be appreciated. Something to select left or right hand for locomotion as well as a brief explanation of what the locomotion labels mean. D-Pad vs Joystick vs etc...The FOV reduction settings seem to have been fixed and I no longer have half my vision removed when walking. Thank you!The basket seemed a bit quirky. My guess is that it was getting stuck on my hand and that was causing me to think that I didn't have to keep the trigger held down and was doping it as I walked.Grabing it from the bottom was a bit difficult and I ended up just flipping it upside down by it's handle. With the physics in the game, that makes for a very awkward real world motion where you have to twist your wrist awkwardly while squatting down a bit. Even then, there's a good chance you're going to spill resources outside of the box. It would be nice if the box lids were open some more and angled backwards instead of forwards.I do like the change to the basket so that it can carry 7 of each type of resource as opposed to just 7 items as I think it was originally. (may be wrong on that one, memory is a bit fuzzy.)The winter update has brought new textures to the resources. They're now snow covered. While this is pretty cool it does mean that it's very hard to tell stone from ore now.The tutorial is well done for the most part. There were two issues. One where Mr. Bones expected me to push Build without actually telling me to do so. He just said to come over here and then stopped talking. Another time he seemed to trigger voice lines before the previous one was finished. Not the end of the world but could use some attention.Smelting the ore into an ingot. This was the worst experience yet. Specifically the tongs. The tongs are pretty ridiculous at the moment. For some reason they seriously trigger the existing hand tracking issues:https://youtu.be/-GTMDvihOwo?t=1478From start to finish it's going to take about 20 - 30 minutes to craft one ingot. That seems on the high side to me.Speaking of the hand tracking. I have more problems with the hands desyncing from the controller in this game, especially when lower to the ground. I have to think it's something about the games code for the hands themselves as there are times that the locomotion icon is still correctly tracking the position of the controller while the hands are going crazy. Again it's something unique to Yore VR that I don't experience with the same frequency in other games.The update to the Pub is a welcome change where we gradually upgrade the building rather than having an up front cost of 300 wood/stone and 50 ingots or whatever the original cost was. It was a pretty hefty price tag. Breaking it up to see your progress works much better.The wolves are pretty easy to take down solo but when they group up, all standing on the same spot, they get pretty deadly. I did get the chance to confirm that you can die in the current version of Yore VR. You simply teleport back to your shack and start over.The cave system was actually pretty large. I wasn't expecting it to be that big. It looks like there are several key rooms where important encounters might take place. I'm interested in seeing what they have planned for filling it up with stuff to slaughter.TL;DR: The game shows promise and the devs are actively fixing and releasing updates but in its current state there are a number of issues that prevent me from recommending the game. If you are ok with or enjoy being a part of the dev process and working around bugs then you may want to support the devs and pick up a copy. If you want a fully fleshed out experience. Keep this one on your radar and wait for now.EDIT:Follow up after crafting an ingot:https://youtu.be/JrMqNFtRGy8EDIT 2:Updated gameplay video to patch 0.3.3.3.

But, after completing the forging level I exited the game and re-entered to get to the house that you start in so I could practice forging. It wouldn't work and because I enjoyed it so much I decided to reload the level. Except there were no materials for me to create an iron ingot with. So I had to reload the entire game just to get it fixed. This actually happened again a few seconds ago when I misclicked when I wanted to quit which led me to writing this review.

,Not Recommended,524380,33196362,Posted: 3 July,all,Deej,"*Edit 8/15/2017*For an early access title this game seems to be falling into the shovelware category due to lack of updates.  Not a good sign for a game that is in early access to be updated so rarely.  Beta builds are fine but for the majority of players who don't participate they are stuck with a product sitting on a shelf collecting dust.  Avoid this one until something changes in the future.*Original Review*Yore has an appealing idea behind it but the bugs, lack of information, and a lack of some desperately needed features hurt the experience.  The game feels at this moment like it is trying to do too many things, but none of the individual features work as well as they should.The game desperately needs some useful information (preferably in the game) for how to work and operate the smelter.  Trying to make iron out of ore I was able to figure out, but when I went to add it to the building I was attempting to construct it would not accept it, it just fell to the ground.  This created a lot of confusion and made me wonder if I had actually created a bar of iron, or something else.  Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong, that is where the frustration kicks in.  I'm not sure I'm doing anything wrong, or if it's just bugged, this is where some in-game tutorials would be of great assistance.Another game breaking bug I have encountered is when placing a building for construction, I got launched up into the air and flew out of the world.  When this happens, you cannot recover your game, because the fall does not kill you, and restarting just spawns you back wherever you were when you disconnected.  The game desperately needs a way to respawn the player at a specific location, and/or a way to from within the game, delete the current save (you have to browse to your saved game file and manually deleted it from explorer).I'd like to see the developers focus on the basics of the game and get those working well, and fix some bugs before adding a bunch of new features.  As the game currently stands (in my case)  I am unable to make any progress, and the game is essentialy a walking simulator.  I'd love to come back to it but right now I would not recommend it until they work some kinks out and address some of the issues I mentioned.  I'll check the game out when it is updated as I always do and update my review accordingly."

It isn't a wonder when you have to directly pick stuff up and and put them in a cart. You will not get this in any cross platform crafting survival because the disadvantage/advantages of seperate motion tracked controllers is clear.For my experience, this is what I expected The Ark:Survival to be when they came with the vr update but as I said, no cross platform game will EVER, I repeat, EVER have difference in hand controls, thats why you need a VR crafting survival from the ground up and YoreVR delivers that precisely. True to form, you will end up realising you are living in this world due to the amount of grinding and workmanship needed to actually craft anything.The only problem is the fact that buildings are made pretty much like a non-tracked controlled gameplay, they just appear after construction, you do not get to build them from scratch but the devs have promised this would change. Other problems are also EA related with too few hostiles, story and npcs to liven up this other world you live in to make it more like a separate world and not entirely your own that would be more immersive as more VR players come into the worldWhat I liked:- True to form crafting- Best graphics so far pertaining to theme (Medieval Open world) of game in VR, though it doesn't match 'the forest'  or the ark but it beats Trickster and Vanishing Realms right of the bat, not comparing ED, Raw Data and other Sci Fi- Open progress and open world exploration (You will have quite a few things to build but you can choose which one you want to build first)What I would have liked to see (Based on the gameplay progress the Dev is following):- Since the Devs aimed for making a town first, perhaps it would have been a better idea to have spawnable npcs that come with buildings or maybe allow them for hire then you can have party systems, auto crafting with hired npcs and town guards as well as tax/income npcs such as miners and tax collectors? I suggest this simply because YoreVR headed for town building first, otherwise I would have recommended more adventure or action elements- Placable building foundations that can be customized later with different wall and ceiling foundations that can be further added with shelves, cupboard, stoves, fireplace, etc- Lesser grind of resources as more items and crafting elements are added in- Weighted difference of different items bringing a new kind of physics to a new kind of VR gamingSmall bugs encountered:- Basket does not come off the cart- Larger hook handling for placing tools- Longer cooling off gloom, i felt it was pretty short with the amount of bugs and unsmooth handling of controllers present- Shorter cooldown for pickaxe (I dont mind the wood) but pickaxe is as though I'm a 70 year old miner, the average gamer is still 30 - 40 years of age- Smelter iron/ore/copper/tin/adamantium/bla bla bla indicator- Fixed item belt position, it currently rotates around while i do a trackpad turning- Reusable unrefined/errored gloom (logically, anything dump back into the smelter should be able to be retempered)You get this game to live and build a town and then 'choose to fight' small hostiles if you wish, consider it Fallout 4 with only settlement gameplay and no adventure or storyline yet. You will scavenge for ♥♥♥♥ for your town building and admire the journey whilst you survive in your new realm, thats it, this is not a medieval action rpg even if it has a few caves and new creatures. It will become action rpg after a long roadmap ahead but right now, this game is focused on what I love to play casually, crafting survival, those feels you get from minecraft or fallout 4 when you weren't particularly interested in the story or the overall game progress but having fun building up and crafting a progress that you enjoy watching into fruition"

I will say, however, that this game is most definitly an early accsess title and that should be taken into consideration when thinking about buying the game.Pros:- Has a awesome foundation for crafting and smelting-has a great roadmap for the future-it hints at a survival element in the future that could make for a awesome experience-love all the detail put into how you smith, load crossbows, and actually mine and chop to get resources- the game is attractive to just look around atCons:-its very glitchy right now (swaying cart handle, bouncy cart that tosses all my resouces around, tools and weapons vanish and re appear in places i think they aren't intended to be. In some cases tools vanish and are no where to be found)-the tracking seems buggy and juttery sometimes. I don't know if this is a hardware issue on my end or a game issue though.-AI needs work, most deer and wolves just stand there and look at me while i hack them to death with my axe. In some cases the deer run when I hit them only to fall through the world.-speaking of falling through the world, its very easy to do. Especially when you are exploring caves.-there is no real way to build and customize my own house from what i saw. I do believe there are plans for ""base buildings"" in the future however.Summary:It's a great concept with alot of potential for the future as long as the dev keeps up with improvments. Unless you are interested in helping out in testing this game or just want to help the development by purchasing it, you probably will get a very small amount of entertainment out of this title right now until its more complete. But if we ever want to see VR games really take off and create amazing experiences, then investing in little diamonds-in-the-ruff like these is what we all should be doing! Hope this helps the developers and buyers alike!"
,Recommended,524380,28234971,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,Mr Saxon,Great game so far. Kinda reminds me of a tribal free version of The forest or maybe Life is Feudal. Havnt gotten very far yet. Built a house and have been running around gathering iron ore and stone for the next project. Not sure about enemies but I have seen a deer. Havnt bothered to mess with him yet. Main complaint with this game is the frame stuttering and that the cart doesnt actually turn. But these are minor issues that will be sorted out soon as the team has been putting out bug fixes for the current build. Anyways if you have a VR get this game.

Make the swords usable and give me something to hit with them.  Fill the cave(s) with loot and baddies.  Make the wolves more formidable.  Reward good shots against the deer.  4 shots to the heart with a bow is just as effective as 4 shots to the leg.  1 heart shot should drop them.  Give the player an armoring station where they can cure leather hides.  Give the player more control over what sword is made.  Make other options than swords.  Leather and plate armors.  Make the player sew and rivet their own leathers.  Put more ore into the game besides iron.Now this one is crucial: LINE THE HANDLES UP WITH THE VIVE CONTROLLER.  It feels so damn unnatural to hold the axe forward straight out and see it sticking straight up.  Two-handing the pickaxe feels good, though.  Implement the same system with 2-handed melee weapons (that you must craft every piece of yourself) and it'll be great.  That's where loot will come into play.  Customizing your weapons and armor more.  Gems and such.  Perhaps a weather system.  More gatherable resources.  Ability to make a campfire.  Dangerous nights.  Make the cave darker, it's bright as♥♥♥♥♥♥and the torch is completely unnecessary.  The cave should howl and subtle dripping noises should be heard within.  I'm just spittin' ideas at you here, you may have already thought of them.  But it's the dream.  I don't actually recommend getting this one yet as there's really nothing to do but shoot deer in the♥♥♥♥♥and hit wolves with an axe.  But I'll recommend it anyway because the foundation is there and I want to see it built upon.  If these ideas are implemented correctly, I'd pay far more than the asking price for it.Gimme dat dreeeeeeaaaaaaam."

While there are aspects that are fun, most of them in fact, there are also bugs that can get on your nerves, like the wagon handle swaying back and forth indefinitely. (Use your tool to stop it from swaying, so you can grab it and pull your wagon :P)Honestly, if you have the money to buy the game and love VR, I would say buy it buy it buy it. Mainly because we need more games like this for VR, games that invite you to put hours and hours into it, build towards an actual sense of progression.Lord knows there are enough wave shooters for VR, this one plays MUCH more like Life is Feudal, which is just fine by me."

I mention in my video how I would like a Donkey to whip and pull me around in the cart instead of carrying it myself. Maybe you could add a mission where you have to grow carrots and find the donkey in the forest and tame it by feeding it carrots or something. Or just capture it by whipping it repeatedly until it submits.The game itself is great so far and I've never seen anything like it. There is room for improvement which isn't unusual for VR early access games nowadays. I like being able to scoot out into the forest with my fancy cart to gather my supplies to build stuffs. I was a fan of the Forest and it reminds me a little of a simpler version that without the crazy mutants scooting around. I've only made it as far as building the smelter and can''t get that figured out but i'm sure it's something I'm doing wrong and will check around online.I was really looking forward to playing this game on release day but ran into crashing issues right off the bad. Despite having to wait awhile the day of release to play I've really enjoyed the game now that i've gotten to play it. I also thought it was really awesome for the Devs that immediatley started troubleshooting the issue I was having. They ended up isolating the issue and long story short made some changes and had to a complete repackage of the game on their end to fix it.

Prior to knowing this, I knew this game had potential, but with great communication, the dev is creating something truly special here. Not only did they make a price drop, they have frequently been updating the game. Will leave my original review below, but  everything I have asked and mentioned has been addressed/fixed by the developer, can't wait to see what's upcoming in the future. So definitely can recommend as the dev has a lot of care and is fully committed to working with the community.Love the idea, love the ambition and risk.Not judging the effort put in by the developers by any means.But unfortunately in it's current state i can't reccomend it for the price, a price drop would be suitable for now, until its more so polished. As mentioned in another review, it's jittery, There are options to help account for that but without a beast of a system everything will be a blur if you dial the settings down.As also mentioned that cart, is a pain, you're required to hold down the trigger the entire time you're moving the cart, it bugs out, when you get to your destination your cart can have a mind of it's own and roll away on it's own haha.I collected the wood for the first mission, brought the cart back to the skele in doing so recieved a pickaxe, held it in my non dominant hand and carried my cart to my next task, i dropped the axe onto the ground, to pick it up with my preferred hand to find that it didnt take into account my room scale and no matter what angle my hands were not even close to the ground to actually be able to pick it up.Don't get me wrong, this has serious potential, just in it's current state i'd avoid purchasing if you have high expectations or expecting a hasstle free experience, if you want to help the dev and have patience, i absolutely give a thumbs up in that case."

Out of all the games i have played for VR none have been as admersive as Yore because you have to craft the sword and bow that you use. You have to craft the house you live in. This is not a shootem up game where you play for 10 minutes and its over, this is much more!If your hesitant to pick the game up just head over to Yore VR forum and read some of the posts. This game is early access so you should expect it to not be complete, but by talking to the developers and giving them ideas on the forums you can shape the game the way you want it while its in this stage.  I honestly think that this game will be in the same league as Ultima online, which was released in 1997 but still has a large player base to this day. You just have to be patient and supportive."

You need to use the smelter to make the iron ore into iron. When i tryed to put the iron into the building, it simply would not work. I looked and found that one other person had the same issue. The devs solution to this was to switch to the alpha build. So I did and nothing changed, i then went to the beta and had the same issue.

That being said...As intriguing as this concept is just as soon as i think i enjoy it, i hate the actual game mechanics that are implemented in this game. The tongs are basically unusable, the tree glitches out and makes me go crosseyed, so i have yo turn away while im chopping on about 1:5 trees i cut down. The cart is an ridiculous, it bounces around like an insane rabid dog that wants off its leash. Almost everywhere i try to blink is inaccessible, including the forge steps?!!! When im holding things in both hands, i have to use my head to place the teleport marker? I had seen that yall started work on a dungeon or cave and hinted at putting climbing into the game and was like ""heck yeah guys! finally someone is doing climbing!"" and i couldnt even get past the blacksmithing system to venture out and explore with a weapon. This game should be free. it has potential to be great. but please focus on making the basics playable before you start making other things. I have a bad taste in my mouth for this game now and ill do my best to pick it up later once these specific issues are fixed. Make stamina determine how far you blink not change to walking after a certain distance. People get sick when they try to blink as far as they can and then all of a sudden start walking. its very disorienting. jist limit how far you blink at one time or something.i will be getting my money back for now. i will support this game later. i at least wanted to gove feedback so you dont kill interest in your game before it gets started.

It's an open-world building game akin to Minecraft, Rust, or Life is Feudal, but it's in VR to add immersion.In practice, however, it falls short. The need to constantly stoop and bend over to pick up harvested resources is a hassle, and the clumsy manner in which you have to slowly gather, transport, and unload resources is equally clumsy, especially given the limited amount of resources you can carry without hauling around a big cart.My advice: Give the player an ""inventory"" that can hold a decent number of items OR make it so that harvested materials automatically go to the cart if it's within arms reach."

I'm a Oculus Touch user and this lead to some rather unplayable issues.  I know they are working on fixing the touch controller problems but i had to ask for a refund until the game moves along with bug fixes. That being said the game did a lot of good when it came to resource gathering and crafting stuff.  The issue at its current stage is the building of the starting locations just requires that you drop some stuff in a chest and click build and *Poof* a building appears.  I will return to this game if they continue to advance its dynamics and move forward with core features.That being said if the DEVs want to reach out to me we can talk more in depth about the good and bad.Remember this is EARLY ACCESS and i only refunded due to controller issues that are currently being worked on.

Cart has been fixed and the materials attach themselves to it. Performance, whilst not perfect, has certainly improved.

I've never seen reprojection kick in so much in a game yet. Any settings below high are just a complete blur.The hand models are at a horrrible angle. My hands are holding the controllers in a relaxed, natural position. My in game hands are dangling outwards like Mr. Burns. ""Excellent""Remember those easy controls and crafting system I mentioned? The game still feels the need to drill it into your head with long tutorials anyway. To worsen things, the cart for carrying your materials is a buggy piece of $h!t and fires all 45 materials you've gathered in all directions.There's potential in it, but the stutter will likely make people ill, and the cart makes a long boring tutorial even longer."
