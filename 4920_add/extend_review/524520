76561197971948490,Recommended,524520,29495851,Posted: 25 January,all,Wraith_Magus,"It's something for those who like fantasy novels that are light-hearted right up until they aren't.  If you liked The Stanley Parable, you might like this.To start with the positives:I'm someone who enjoys psychological evaluations done in games, and in this game, your magical powers are based upon personality profiling. Be indirect and gracious, and you come up a water-elementalist.  Be hotheaded and brash, and you're a fire-elementalist.  Etc.The story, when it starts to actually unfold, displays a good deal of time spent world-building to make it distinct from generic fantasyville, although even with that said, I always wind up hungry for more world building.  It's a fantasy world of peacefully coexisting humans, elves, orcs, dwarves, and gnomes plunked down ""because it's fantasy""... and I'd really like to hear some more about how these races are meaningfully integrated into the world.  But I guess the JRPG-like church consipiracy backstory will have to do...Also, this game actually tells you what choices up what stats, and when stat checks occur, so that you knowwhen and whyyou fail at a task.Why don't more of these games do that?!But as someone who enjoys this kind of fiction, I can't help but have gripes...The writing style is decently clever, but unfortunately, the author tries a little too hard to be more clever than they actually are.  Suspension-of-Disbelief-shattering anachronistic references mar otherwise serious moments in the narrative, undercutting the drama and ability to relate to the characters, which is the lifeblood of a story like this.  In the balancing act of taking itself too seriously versus taking nothing seriously, this game is in the ""laughs at its own jokes"" territory.  You get a ""Watchu talkin' bout?"" as part of a serious narrative.  This also applies to how everything is described sexually - your would-be knight friend is referenced as always wanting to play with her sword, or smack things with her sword... HER sword in this case, because the character's gender is determined by your own choices, but the text was obviously not written to take account of this fact.  Likewise, you must be a real horn-dog.  At least, that's what the text assumes, because even the tiniest bit of innuendo is always presumed in its most sexual light.The game also suffers from a bit of the problem of ""Everyone is Protagasexual""; if you play as a gay character, it magically means that every character becomes gay the instant they consider you, even if every other relationship is straight. If you're playing as a lesbian, the game comments on how the girls all wanted to flirt with you, while your magic lesbian awareness field keeps straight men from ever trying to ask you out. (And vice-versa if a gay man.)  For a world that occasionally tries to be the 14th century (said directly in the text) with occasionally realistic depictions of medieval life, it's also surprisingly casual about homosexuality even while it says that young women who cannot produce children aren't valued.  Must be the effect of all the elves they live with!  Any character that you're supposed to have anything remotely like an attraction to will have their gender set by your preference (no bisexual players!) decided at the start of the game, and every single one of them tends to be described with passages about how you're instantly enchanted by their looks, in spite of the actual description of their appearance, short of eye and hair color, being quite scant.  Also, one of your romantic options is a furry catboy/girl. Plus anyone remotely magical changes eye colors constantly, even within the same paragraph, and your character gets a grey hair stripe like Rogue from X-Men.  (Even though you never set your own hair color to start with.) Maybe it's for the best there wasn't more description, or we'd be dealing with a bad Harry Potter fanfic...It also asks you to make most of your choices that determine what sort of character you are, and how you view other entities like, say, the church, before you even know a thing about what the local religion even is.  This practically begs you to just insert your own opinion of your own locally dominant real-life religion, when, you know, the fact that this religion is not any real-world religion, and doesn't operate on the same principles might have SOME impact on how you react to it...Also, as is always the flaw of these sorts of stories, there's basically one path forward up until the very end, and all that changes are your stats.   Stats are used pass/fail, but different builds basically use different stats to accomplish the same thing.  (I.E. Talk someone down rather than force them to relent with force.)  This ultimately runs into the same problem other games like Versus has (or for that matter, BioWare games with good/evil meters), where once you pick one stat, you might as well min/max it, because each time you pick it, that stat gets better (and its opposing stat gets worse), and makes it more likely to succeed next time, as well.  This turns the story not into deciding what you would do in the moment so much as guessing which choice powers up your build. At least, unlike Versus, this gamedoeshave checks without choices, where you just need to have a certain amount of ""vigilant"" to succeed, that actually give the choice of a build some sense that you missed out on some things.  These are usually inconsequential, because they can't really meaningfully punish players for a choice when they would later punish the opposite choice, since there isn't the sort of inventory or health system of a real RPG, but it's still at least a token effort that gives some sense of meaning to choices.  Other choices give you ""renown"", which is basically just ""right answer score"" - you can't really fail most of the game's choices, so you just get renown when you pick the right answer for your build, and the game progresses, regardless.And while this may be part of the ""not as clever as they think they are"" gripe, the story as a whole is just WAY too meta to really get entirely into.  It starts off pretending to be a swashbuckling tale of heroism, and your character is an Action Survivor that gets carried over the finish line in spite of their abilities by their companions at every turn.  M Night Shyamalan may as well have guest written the ending.So... bottom line, expect less Errol Flynn and more Hideo Kojima.  Fun for those who enjoy getting their chain yanked."

The story was pretty good, even if you are constantly assumed to be a pervert... but playing through it a second time made this an easy not recommended review unfortunately. I play Choose Your Own Adventure style games like this because I like to have the choices and see the different ways everything can resolve. Sadly, most of the 'choices' in my second playthrough (Where I was choosing the opposite of what I did in the first playthrough of course) quickly turned in, ""You realize that's a bad idea and do the other thing."" That kind of illusion of choice then forcing me to do what I didn't choose really annoys me.So, if you only play the game once, I'd consider it. If you're like me and play it through many times to see all the different endings, don't bother."

However, dying in a random way when two options are given, with no idea what can or should happen, more than two hours into the story in the seventh chapter and no having a chance to even re-start that chapter, instead being forced to start again from the very first page, is not something anyone should enjoy."

76561198136352089,Not Recommended,524520,32819004,Posted: 26 June,all,nmjjmn,"I'm afraid I can't recommend this product. As the author of Fatehaven seems to have missed the point of interactive novels, namely the part where they're interactive. I will admit that I haven't finished the whole game, as I'm hoping to get a refund, but judging by the first four chapters, the story flows more like a novel, and, to be fair, is well written and enjoyable. But that's undermined by the fact that the 'decisions' you make in this story have little consequence outside of choosing the gender, sexuality and name of the MC.Otherwise, all choices lead to the same conclusion, with a little varying dialogue beng the only real difference between them. Entire pages will pass by without a single decision at all during the ""serious"" moments of the story. Your characters personality is also set in stone, with them constantly being a pervert (which can get kind of annoying) or automatically having certain opinions on things.But the biggest example of how linear this game this would have to be the inclusion of the ""corruption"" stat. As the name implies, it determines how evil your character is, starting at zero, but steadily rising the more you kill people, or the more people die. There's only one small problem, as listed above, none of your decisions matter, so the corruption stat will simply raise automatically, independant of any choices you make. No really, mine rose from 0 to 20 during one of the earlier mentioned moments where pages pass without there being any decisions from you.Worse yet, is the illusion of free will they try to create in the game. For example, in battle, you have two choices, kill the opponent with X, or kill the opponent with Y, that's it (Either choice raises your corruption level, btw). Why not have an option to knock them out or restrain them? Especially if you're going to have this ""corruption"" stat be a part of the game, you could have choosing a non-lethal option lower it instead of raise it. But no, that's too much interaction for this interactive novel.Final verdict: 3.5/10"

The ending was ultimately disappointing, because while there is enough information to draw some fairly sound conclusions, there is no concrete explanations to some things, and over all, I was left wanting for answers, and for more in general.Besides that, it's a giant cliffhanger."

I wouldn't go so far as to say that Fatehaven is on par with titles like 'The Name of the Wind'. However, I would say that if you enjoy the classic tropes introduced by Tolkien and if you have ever yelled at the main character in a story for doing something stupid, wishing that you could have made the decision instead, this interactive novel might be for you.It also does a bloody brilliant job of makingyouthe protagonist or antagonist and evoking your emotions."

76561198003233400,Recommended,524520,25591978,"Posted: 19 September, 2016",all,fieryace,"Easily my favorite of the Hosted Games, probably my second favorite of everything COG has on Steam only after Choice of Robots. This author writes great characters and has an entertaining and easy to read writing style.In particular I like the author's use of the COG engine's stats system, it's probably the best I've seen in any of the games using the engine. Beginning choices are used to establish a personality, which after a certain point stops changing, and from that point on consistency in your choices is rewarded instead. The other thing I really like about this is that the stat checks are used to determine how some scenes play out. I really really like this method of using the stats as it rewards role-playing and adds flavor and replayability. This is the same system that is used in the author's “Samurai of Hyuga” series, but I feel like it put to much better use here.As a side note, I thought the magic system was a really cool touch. After your “personality” is established, you are assigned a type of magic that fits that personality and that is what is used through the rest of the story. This also means that several scenes are significantly different and adds to replayability.Overall IVERYstrongly recommend this one, it's the closest I've seen to a perfect COG style game.Though it is near perfection and I absolutely recommend this game, I do have a few small suggestions for the author.1)Pleasehire a professional editor. The weird autocorrected typos and malapropisms do not ruin the game by any means, but they can still be very distracting.2) The ending could have been forshadowed more. Again, very small complaint and doesn't ruin anything, but it is something that I personally thought could be improved.3) It would be nice to have more information about what a choice entails. In particular, I may not always understand or agree on the interpretation of a given choice, so added detail, and in particular making the consequences of a choice clear before the choice is made, would help a lot."

It's a painfully generic fantasy world piled high with cliches and irritating characters. The dialogue is uninteresting at best, and the ""what gender are you"" choice is rendered as a question about whether you just got smacked in the balls or the breasts (and I'm relatively sure the game actually does describe a female MC as having ""sensitive teats"" which is a really weird thing to read). The writing switches between being dull and uncomfortable, and in the end I was tasked with deciding whether I should try to tough it out to the end, or write this review and uninstall a half-finished game.I think I made the right choice."
76561198106576815,Recommended,524520,30784256,Posted: 27 March,all,Codexepidemia,"This is one of the best CYOA stories I have ever read. That being said, I have some mixed feelings about it. It is one of the CYOAs that seem to change more of the flavor of the writing and a few details, with regard to your choices. While trying to not spoil anything about the story, I'll try to give some indications of how this story goes about things.The story seems to have little side stories, or certain pages that only happen like that with the influence of some choice you have made. While this may be a common feature of CYOA stories, it is the main consequence of choosing your own adventure with this one. One way of trying to go through it is by constructing a base character in your mind and trying to immerse yourself intot he story by how they would react to a given situation. This CYOA can seem somewhat limited in this respect, with how certain choices you make can influence (or be influenced) by things that don't always seem to be fit to the mentality that you have with your character. Thankfully there was only one situation that I encountered where you could really ""fail"".The writing mainly differs in the changing of the flavor of how your character thinks, speaks, and acts. This can be the difference of some sentences, paragraphs, or pages. Certain scenes will only develop if certain choices are made, though a lot of the story is predetermined. These may be limitations that may seem odd in a CYOA ""game."" But if you are looking for a well written story to become immersed in, with your mind visualizing every scene where you come to love, hate, or experience any other shade of feeling for the characters, this is a great read. The writing is some of the best I've ever seen. And if you want to merely have a story that is worth some good laughs (without the more serious parts taken in too much), then it is still worth a read. The writer manages to paint scenes with relatively few words (the only other author I've read that does it to such an extent is H.P. Lovecraft (genres not withstanding)). This seems to be done with excellent word choice, and giving certain details about scenes that help convey the overall mood that is set.Of course, the story is not without its faults. Though I think that many of them would have been resolved if the story had simply been longer, perhaps with a sequal (I am reading the triology that the author is working on, and so far, Fatehaven really seems to be far more worthy of additional writing). There are quite a questions that the author never really fully answers. While some are addressed at least partially enough (and with a few particular hints) to where some good guesses or assumptions can be made, others are left with blanks to only be filled in with some relatively reckless speculation. This is particularly apparent with some of the characters in the story. While not all of them may be main characters, some still have enough development to make you have attachements to them. This leads you to wanting to know more about them, but the story doesn't really allow for that.The biggest disappointment regarding this whole thing. . . is the ending. While I want to avoid any spoilers, or too much of telling people of how they should feel to any particular part of the story, the ending was my least favorite part. I was downright disappointed, crestfallen even. This is a wonderful journey that is let down by where you end up getting. I really feel like it would have been a great deal better if the story had been expanded on, such as some additional chapters or a whole sequal.With some last words, I do plan on going through the story at least one more time. I might change this review to some extent at least, though what I experienced with the initial reading will still hold true to my opinion of it (even if it gets a few tweaks to it). This story is a journey, and one worth taking. The destination, however, is lackluster and makes you want to get back on the road, this road or another. And I authentically wish that I could have experienced more of this world, and gotten to better know the people in it."

The premise and overall experience maybe short but its sweet, compelling and most all real. Unlike most visual novels and the likes, it does not need much time for the reader to feel fully engrossed in the story which the writer is fully aware of and does not create any needless fillers within the writing and takes the reader right to the point, all the while delivery quirk remarks here and there.But for me personally, I love the interaction going on between the characters themselves, but one thing that I particularly notice was the lack of words our character has instead, the author did something remarkable instead, our every actions and even seemingly written words were in fact stated in third person, thus each words we might believe we said is nothing more than a figment of our own imagination. A wonderful neat little twist, I was not aware of until the very end.As for the romance, we have about three characters to choose from, each with there own backstory though sadly, due to how short the story was, the partners in question lack the necessary backstory however, this weakness was reinforced by how each of there actions had a reason to it, most which are not because of silly anime cliche (main character etc..). My favourite among them had to be Patches, perhaps her own attitude and characteristics matchs my girlfriend in real life. That aside, these partners felt real and someone I can relate to in real life.Overall the experience maybe short and sweet but it leaves you wanting more, especially Patches more."

The narrative point of view makes it all more immersive, as YOU imagine YOURSELF doing and acting out the choices YOU made.The only (tiny) complaint is that there should be speech marks around the text to help seperate parts where you are speaking and where you are just 'thinking'."

I like the lighter tone of the tale, writing style wise, though I admit sometimes it gets confusing about whether the hero is thinking or talking. But the game remains really cool, as long as you like the type, of course - I understand many people won't like 100% written games with no graphics and music.It's easier than most of the other games I own (from that type of games, obviously), wich means it's a good start if you're new to the genera. It's pretty short too, wich means you can replay pretty fast if you're not sattisfied with your ending!So yeah, I highly recommend this little game!"

Where do we start?Unlike an unfortunate number of stories, this one actually has jokes, humor, wit, and general awesomeness. The characters are not boring, the action is relevant, the romances aren't forced (well, one of them - but it's not exactly a romance. Don't worry, concerned parents/ underage children there's no.... you know [except you, underage children - I hope you don't know]. Actually, maybe it's possible, though I doubt it).Where was I? Right. Well, another awesome bit is that it actually opens with a whole lot of people dying (I feel safe saying this much, seeing as it's like, the first 2 chapters, and you should already know this from the demo, and if you didn't play the demo yet I don't know why you're considering buying this without checking out if it's your type yet).And finally - the end is totally unexpected. Like, towards the end I was getting a bit bored - 2.5 hours will do that - but then, the entire last 2 chapters knocked me out completely. #character-death #illuminati-confirmed #WTF-just-happened?"

Your character magic depends on your choice and even if the results are the same, the text IS NOT. People who don't like this style don't like it only because they care more for results than the actual path to result. It is still a CYOA wheter you want it or not, it's just that what changes is the way you appreciate the main story that is still the same. Those variations still add narratively and to the atmosphere too.4.I do find the humor funny here and am able to identify to the main character who's not a perfect icon of a hero, far from that (not the pervert side, but I actually don't think he's that of a pervert. Guys, just admit there's different level of perversity and here the thing is just intended for kiddy puns, really).5.I think a lot of reviews there are misunderstanding what was intended by the author and just don't like what he chose to do. Well, ok, but don't go criticize the thing compared to other CYOA. Because it is just a rare type of CYOA but it is still indeed one.6.The story is slow to start. But try to stick to the end. You could be surprised.7.Because it is more like a novel with variations, the secondary characters have more depth than in normal CYOA.8.I still enjoyed playing the games more than once to see how the writings changed. The result might be the same, but not the path taken.9. I do recommend it. It may not please everyone, because there are clear writing choices that have been made here. It is still interesting and worth a reading. Once you finished the story, try to... put the pieces together again, you'll understand many little details in the writings. I can only approve this."
