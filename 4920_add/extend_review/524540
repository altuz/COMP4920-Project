76561198003233400,Not Recommended,524540,25565914,"Posted: 18 September, 2016",all,fieryace,"UPDATE:I am leaving the original review below, but within ~6 hours of posting this review a patch went out that fixes problem #2.This is one of those situations where I wish Steam had a ""neutral"" or ""cautious recommendation"" option. I 'm still going to leave this as a ""don't recommend"" because I really do believe that the endings of both stories were mishandled BUT I will say that if that kind of thing doesn't bother you (and this wouldn't be the first COG to have that problem) then you should consider this to be a ""cautious recommendation"" from me.Also, in case the author reads this, I really do like the writing style and character development, and really do I look forward to seeing more from you in the future, but please consider hiring an editor and maybe run the script past an expert on subjects you are not intimately familiar with.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I think I should start this review by saying two things. First, this review covers both parts 1 and 2 together because I don't think they can be fairly reviewed separately. Second, I like this author's writing style, character development is a strong point, and would like to see more from them but I just can't recommend this one unless some serious work is done; the talent is clearly there but this particular production just falls short.As you can see, I'm not recommending this one. I'll start with the important reasons and then move on to some nitpick things I'd like to mention.Big problems 1+2:1) Both stories stop in the middle. The first one does a decent job of wrapping up and ends on a predictable, although in my opinion extremely unnecessary, cliffhanger. The major missing pieces of book 1 are revealed immediately in the first 2 chapters of book 2. This means that book 1 doesn't really end until about the 3rd chapter of book 2, which, without getting into spoilers, was the logical beginning of book 2 anyway.The second story, and this is one of my biggest complaints about the series as it stands, ends right in the middle of things and wraps up nothing which just feels cheap.2) The second book fails to recognize choices from the first. I don't mean that it fails to account for minor choices or makes small inconsistencies in the narrative. I mean that the beginning of the game tells you what choices have been loaded from the first game, and they are flat out wrong. Mine told me that I had failed to save someone from being attacked, when in fact I had chosen to kill all of their attackers, and also told me that I chosen to ask for help from one group when it was made clear, in the first book, that I had asked for help from an entirely different group, the consequences of which are part of the opening of book 2.Nitpicking:A lot of what I want to say here can be dismissed because the story is fictional and the setting is not meant to be completely historically accurate. That said, if you have more or less exposure to Japanese language/history/culture than the author, you will probably find parts of the story very immersion-breaking. If you don't have much exposure, many things will not make sense without looking them up as the author does not provide enough context for all of the references/arbitrary Japanese phrases for someone that isn't at least somewhat familiar with the language and culture. This isn't entirely a minor complaint either as at least two decisions in the game only explain the significance of an action after you have made the choice. This could have been somewhat solved with a glossary but none is provided.If you are familiar with Japanese language/culture/history, the apparent lack of research can be very distracting. Japanese words/phrases are used in ways/contexts that no native speaker would use them, are frequently awkward, and occasionally completely incorrect. The same applies to historical/cultural references that could easily have been checked on Wikipedia but clearly weren't. This doesn't even get into some of the bizarre anachronisms, not just in setting but in speech.Overall the world (which I have to admit, I liked anyway) feels like it has been sloppily patched together from chopped up pieces of Rurouni Kenshin, Bleach, Samurai Champloo, Street Fighter, Gintama, James Clavell's Shogun, and for some reason Fantasy Island.Conclusion:The overall lack of polish on this one, and the fact that neither of the (currently) two available books is complete or standalone in any sense means that I don't recommend them. If the first two problems were fixed, and if this was given to a professional editor first (“samurai riding houses” has to be one of my favorite typos ever), this could be an exceptional story, but as it is it just isn't worth the time or money."

As far as actually playing it, I found the characters to be feel like they're alive. Each of them having their own flaws; apparent or not. Even you the main character are not a Gary Stu; thank god, and you will have to make some diificult choices. I picked the choices that aligned with my frame of mind and I was surprised how much it enhanced gameplay.Was skeptical but, would recommend it to anyone; if I had any friends ;-; 10/10"

Don't go in expecting historical fiction, unless you assume Legend of the Five Rings was a docudrama.  And without spoilers, you may wish to take notes on anything that sounds important and remember choices you make for later.  Just saying."
,Recommended,524540,25989121,"Posted: 11 October, 2016",all,Redfren,"It's a great game, Very anime like if you enjoy those types of things. You really feel the impact of your choices perhaps more so then any choice game I have played yet.That said It's very frustrating to know when you make a choice that you shouldn't have made. Perhaps that above all things is my biggest complaint. You can enjoy the story but you truly feel the impact of your choice more so if you made the wrong one.It's easy to say there are no right or wrong answers however that is not what this game gives you the feeling of. You make a wrong choice and you are going to realize it very quickly. I intend to play the game again and hope that I can get into a better flow of things, for now this is my review and it's a positive one, but with reserved concern"
76561198065979638,Recommended,524540,25634721,"Posted: 22 September, 2016",all,verstehen,"Note: This review is for 1 and 2 together as the games are meant to be played back-to-back.A fairly interesting story and a good exploration of character. Overall, I enjoyed both this game and it's sequel. There are some issues, however, of which to be aware. I caught a few spelling and grammar errors while I was reading; they weren't anything too terrible or annoying but there were enough that the errors were noticeable. Essentially, I think the author needs a good editor but the foundation of the writing is there. I was also a little disappointed that there isn't the same sort of choice in character creation I've gotten used to in other Choice Of games, many of which allow genderqueer and non-heterosexual options in the gameplay; Samurai of Hyuga does not. I was also a little leery of the Japanese-inspired setting (or maybe it's more Legend of the Five Rings inspired? And if so, it DEFINITELY needs to be advertised as such) which requires a lot of background knowledge about Japan and Japanese customs that players may not have, not to mention all the random untranslated Japanese which can be jarring. I was also a little annoyed with the cliffhanger ending on game 2 in comparison to game 1 as game 1 at least tried to wrap the main story of that game up while setting up the plot of the next one. Game 2 just ends with no resolution whatsoever.Despite the problems with the games, I did have a lot of fun playing through and I'm planning (at some point in the future) going back and trying out the alternate pathway through the games."
76561198037754319,Recommended,524540,26199942,"Posted: 24 October, 2016",all,thelittletpot,"The writer has clearly been watching Ruronin Kenshin.Jokes aside, if you have a deep familiarity with the nuances of Japanese language, history and culture, then I'd recommend picking this up only if you can easily suspend your disbelief, otherwise, this game will easily ruffle your feathers. If that's not an issue for you and you're a fan of Japanese history-pieces and anime, then this will be right up your alley.One thing to note is that the game places you in kind of a pre-defined character role. While you have the ability to decide  whether you are a man or a woman, gay or straight (bisexual people are apparently nonexistent in this world), this story makes quite a lot of your decisions for you. That's not necessarily a bad thing though.I wouldn't call this a game. Rather, I would call it a brilliant way to tell a story in a way that forces the reader into the shoes of the main character. It's told from a first-person view and offer enough choices and stats for you to feel as if you're at least marginally in charge of your character's personality, even though the outcomes seem to be fairly minimal. The important part is in the writing, the presentation and the way you're able to immerse yourself into the role of the ronin-character the author has created.Now, for some nit-picking; the author clearly has plenty of knowledge regarding Japanese history and culture, but is lacking enough for it to be noticable. SUPER-MINOR SPOILER: an example is how the author decided to invent a marginalized ethnic group referred to as the Kondo, a group that is, as far as I can tell, completely fictional and added simply for the sake of some racial tension. This is a bit odd as there are actual indigenous groups in Japan (such as the ainu) who could have easily filled such a role. Another odd change is how Yamato, which was a real-life prefecture in what is today the Nara prefecture, is demoted into being just a city. The fact that the author seems to know that Yamato was actually the imperial seat of power for a while suggests that the author has some knowledge of Japanese history makes certain liberties they've taken with the presentation rather baffling. If this was supposed to take place during the Kofun-period (as suggested by the use of the name Yamato) then why are there Yakuza around?! The Yakuza didn't show up until 800 years later! Not to mention, there are random Japanese words and phrases spread all over and while they are mostly 'technically' correct, they're almost always contextually wrong! (an emperor would NEVER say ""Gomen nasai""!)*deep weeb breaths*Then again, it could be that this story simply takes inspiration from Japanese history and culture, rather than taking place within it.All in all, this is a decent and worthwhile story. Unless you're the type of person who takes issue with historical, cultural and linguistic inaccuracies."
76561198203337561,Recommended,524540,25845537,"Posted: 3 October, 2016",all,vroomvroom,"TL;DR: I'd recommend this to people who like reading and Japanese-inspired settings. If you like stories, then you might check it out because it is a good and interactive one, but don't expect a lot of difference between playthroughs. If you hate reading, then you will have a bad time; there isn't anything beyond reading and what imagination you bring with you: no sound, music, or pictures.Samurai of Hyuga was a smooth reading experience. While I enjoyed the story that was presented to me and would like to heavily praise it, there are some things that I must address to prospective buyers beforehand so that there aren't any misunderstandings about the product: I hesitate to call it a video game and would say that it is best labeled as an interactive story. There are no sounds, music, or pictures, just words and some choices for you to select from. The choices that you choose do not change how the story plays out, but does change how your character reacts and may even add or take away a few pages, so they are more of interactions (I went through the game twice and did two completely opposite playthroughs and largely had the same experience minus some differences in dialogue).Samurai of Hyuga has an interesting mechanic where for the first half of the game your responses define your character and sets your character's 'attunement' (if you make a lot of perverted responses or protective response within the first half of the game, then your character ends up being defined as such and any contradictory responses go against your character's attunement, although I noted no consequences of going against your attunement). It's a bit of a weird mechanic, but I didn't see it as something negative or annoying. A consequence of choosing a lot of the same type of response (responses have types, though they aren't laid out for you until after you have selected and chosen it) is that later in the story, if it is part of your attunement, some portions of the game has your character make dialogue responses automatically which are suited to their attunement; so if you choose charming responses a lot, then the game is going to make a lot of charming responses for your character because it is in character for your character to respond that way. The auto-responses don't get in the way of choice, there are still choices/interactions to be made in the later half of the game. By the way, you can name your character from a list of names or make your own as well as choose their gender and sexual preference. In addition to this, you can import your character and his/her choices to the sequel.One thing that might really frustrate players is the fact that there is no way to do two playthroughs at the same time. You are locked into what you are playing until you hit the restart button, so if you make a wrong choice or misinterpret something you have to deal with (kinda cool, makes it much more life-like in my opinion, however some will not like that sort of thing). There is no way to go back to previous pages-bar restarting the entire story-however, it is set up to where you have a button on the bottom of the page that you must click to move on to the next one so there is barely a risk of accidentally skipping a page (I never did and most pages seem to have interactions you must make which further reduces that risk).With the explanations and potential turn-offs out of the way, I can now focus on praising/discussing what I like about Samurai of Hyuga. The writing itself was very descriptive and interesting; this is something I have trouble tearing myself away from once I start reading. The characters felt real, captivating, and were very well done. The dialogue never made me cringe or feel shame, it was very natural. I was always able to keep up with what was going on and able to picture it in vivid detail thanks to how skillfully the words were delivered. I'd also like to offer that from a price standpoint it is cheaper than a lot of novels, especially the hardback ones and is a bit longer in length than your average novel (over 500 pages long). I realize the positives I list off may seem quite short in comparison to the explanation I gave, but there isn't much I can say without giving examples and spoiling some of the experience. I really only have the mixed feeling about there not being a way to go back to the previous pages without restarting.Samurai of Hyuga is a resounding “yes!” to avid readers that enjoy swordplay and/or Japanese-esque settings, however, please be aware that the story as a whole is a few sequels away from being finished."

If you choose the option not to kill it, than it shows a message pretty much saying ""This game contains some violent scenes, and if your not comforable with that, than we understand."" and displays an option to quit the game. I chose the option NOT to kill the fish, not because I felt uncomfortable, but because that is the option that I wanted my character to do. If you're going to include an option, than that option should be an actuall choice, rather than a dead end with option to quit. However, it is still a great game."

Wait, on second thought - I didn't!It's funny, it's violent, it's interesting, the plot moves at  a normal pace, it's long but not boringly so (2.5 hours, to be precise), the main character was awesome (though that's because you decide literally EVERYTHING about his/her personality, which I personally think is very good), it's got puns, suggestive jokes (well, I view them as jokes - you can read however you want, but I personally feel that the author wrote those in to be funny. Of course, it depends on how you create your character - you don't have to make him/her a perv. Though I don't know if that would make a difference, seeing as mine was one), the other characters are cool/stupid/hilarious to tease/angsty/weird/suicidal/evil/unbearably good, and this is just generally awesome.12/10!
