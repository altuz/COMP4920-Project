So if you don't like novels to begin with, obviously your time would be better spent elswhere.Definently need to read the first instalment before this one. Thankfully, it's available here on steam!http://store.steampowered.com/app/524540/"

Good Review]Continuing right off from the cliffhanger at book 1, it was refreshing to dive right back into the story. Already I have grown attached to the various characters who reside by your side, each with strengths and flaws that make them feel alive, and very much human. Yanderes have been the bane of my existence and it's nice to see it reflected in the engaging and sometimes grim and humorous story. At a glance this series may not seem like much but once you break past that hesistance to purchase this you won't regret it( unless you're illiteral or something). It's a relief to still see how your choices impact the story as well as add additional dialogue according to your choices. Sure there aren't any pictures but I respect substance through engaging works of literature than through excessive amounts of pictures. Although I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that I may have to wait a while for the next one, I give this a 10/10"

If you like CYOA games and the first part of this story then you will likely enjoy this one. For the amount of time I played this and the amount of interest it managed to get out of me it surely represents great value for the price.If you playthrough it once you can always create another character and do things differently. I have two characters in which I take different options. Not all options will change the outcome of things though I should warn you, there is some illusion of choice, but nevertheless it does allow you to really be your character and the characters I play really feel like my own.The writing is good and its easy to get immersed into things, and I definitely feel attached to the characters. After being with them in the story and interacting with them throughout the story you genuinely care about them.You can choose certain aspects of your Ronin character, such as their name and aspects of their personality, but there are many things you also cannot personalise which makes sense. Just a warning.Be warned about the cliffhanger at the end.I recommend playing the first game before this one."

Though there is one glareing flaw i have to point out. THE 3rd BOOK IS NOT OUT YET! GAH! T.T soo mean..."

,Recommended,524560,25989130,"Posted: 11 October, 2016",all,Redfren,"It's a great game, Very anime like if you enjoy those types of things. You really feel the impact of your choices perhaps more so then any choice game I have played yet.That said It's very frustrating to know when you make a choice that you shouldn't have made. Perhaps that above all things is my biggest complaint. You can enjoy the story but you truly feel the impact of your choice more so if you made the wrong one.It's easy to say there are no right or wrong answers however that is not what this game gives you the feeling of. You make a wrong choice and you are going to realize it very quickly. I intend to play the game again and hope that I can get into a better flow of things, for now this is my review and it's a positive one, but with reserved concern"

,Recommended,524560,33060734,Posted: 30 June,all,Blade,"I admit I got off to a rough start with book 1, I honestly wasn't too enthralled by it. But it picked up and it was worth the play. This however had me hooked right from the start. I really enjoyed this game and I'd recommend it to any of my story loving friends. It was full of action, humor, and suspense."
,Recommended,524560,25850548,"Posted: 4 October, 2016",all,reinhartalvaro,"A decent game but a really weak game and a disappointing one, Fatehaven was a perfectly complete game and the first game was a balanced game with everything perfect but romance but the 2nd game feels like an MC travelling with his/her crew as the first half is a shogi match story arc and the second one is mystery island story arc, its starting to feel like a slow anime with slow pacing, the story barely progresses and the characters were all unimportant and weak while the existing characters weren't developed at all, the interactions were good and the scenes were good but it was too slow and unimportant......but to continue the series you need to play this game I guess, well the Heroes Rise trilogy also had a disappointing 2nd entry.The 3rd one should really focus on an epic story with romance and character interactions all in a balanced packaged like Fatehaven as this game feels like 2 unimportant anime filler arcs.........."

,Recommended,524560,25722097,"Posted: 27 September, 2016",all,Morrier,"A fun game, but not quite the worthy successor to the first; after a rather tense opening act, the story begins to crawl at a snail's pace and never seems to find its steam, not even by the end. Tiptoeing around spoilers, but I was very disappointed when I chose restraint with a certain someone for the sake of someone else, only for the story to shoehorn in a jealousy subplot. It really shattered my illusion of choice in this one, but all in all, I feel it was worth the purchase. I just hope the next Book has better pacing."

I hope the creators continue this story, I need more of this. Play book one first if you're going to buy this game, it makes more sense if you do."
76561198168647573,Recommended,524560,33301465,Posted: 5 July,all,lachanshachak,"It's a good book, though personally I think the first one was better, for a simple reason - the first one was, somehow, funnier. Maybe it's because the entire book is.... how to say this without spoilers.... centered around drama? And I'm not a big fan of drama.The book ends in the middle of the end, which I really don't get, and it's kind of annoying, but what can I do? It's a small price to pay.Also, I didn't like how little Junko, the psychopathic ronin with a thing for whoever your character is, appears. I mean, the insane murderer is always a favorite, so put them in the book!If your looking for blood and all that, like last book - sadly, much fewer people die in this book, though I'm happy to say all the deaths happen in extremely gruesome ways.Totally worth my misly 6$, so it's totally worth yours."
76561198121357316,Recommended,524560,29724022,Posted: 5 February,all,BLAKWAMUN,"It was good, however just like Book 1 I did not like the color distinction regarding the Kondos. When reading these books I really like to immerse myself into the character and I would be considered a KONDO by looks. However the book made it clear I was different than the darker complexioned  Kondo which switched me into playing someone else and not me and took away from the experience a little. But overall awesome, ready for Book 3 since I thought it would be a demon a book, but apparently not."
