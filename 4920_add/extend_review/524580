Also, take note that this game has lots of farming to do as well especially on gold,wp and exp if u wan to max out everything...Overall would r8 it 8/10P.S. - Play it with a pc controller it has better controls than keyboard :)"

,Recommended,524580,32859291,Posted: 27 June,all,Babooba,"Way better than the original game but my issues is that if you listen/follow to the tutorial instructions, the game becomes too easy. I only hit level 10 recently and all of the mobs are too easy. Mobs either miss me and bosses only hit me for 100 damage max. Might have grinded too much but I only do each encounter per dungeon once, so all of my ""levels"" come from doing WP skill point increases. I also don't have any of the DLC so I am using the standard gear. If you are alright at being super massively overpowered at the start, then this is the JRPG for you."

Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force is like an enhanced version of Fairy Fencer F but with more contents. The amount of storyline gets tripled and has numerous of endings. The combat system is same as always but you're able to add up to 6 characters in your party! However, all of the enemies have higher stats just for this occasion, some were too OP. The soundtrack is really incredible especially the songs from the ending of each routes. The story is somewhat predictable but it didn’t bother me too much. Overall Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force is an excellent game with solid improvement over the original game that other JRPG fans will enjoy. Looking forward to the possible sequel!"
,Recommended,524580,29945433,Posted: 15 February,all,Neppu--!? | Bolt.gg,"Definitely a True Remake from its Original Counterpart2 hours into the game, the first thing you'll notice is the graphical upgrade. Not the upscaled resolution from the Original game. This game offers atrue native 1080psupport and better textures. (For those who play games in 4K, you would have to wait for mods) As for language...Englsih, Japanese, Chineseare available for you to choose from!I'm sure most of the players who played the Original are much more interested on the new routes this game had to offer. Or you are me who just want to revisit the same route and see how much has changed. Everything feels much more satisfying than I expect to be.Better gameplay, more party members, much more detailed story(which is quite lacking from the Original) and so much more. For those who are new to the game, I would say if you are looking for a in depth JRPG, this is not for you. It's basically a visual novel with some light JRPG element (Pretty much like Neptunia if you ever play one before)PC OptimizationI would say its way better than Megadimension Neptunia. Everything is stable,no random stutter(which is most likely the game is using Adoptive V-Sync). Maximum Frame Rate is still60 fps, don't expect something crazy like 144 hertz. MORE IMPORTANTLY,DEDICATED PC CONTROLS. Something that I always complain about an Iffy PC Port (although I use controller). For some reason there is not much graphical settings for you to tweak in the game, lets hope for an update to enable us to tweak what we wanted it to be (just like Nep VII). So forlower end PC's, plzdo not buy thisfor this very moment. It is much more intense than Nep VII.I saw the reviews saying that the game is buggy etc. ForNVIDIA users, tryadd the gameinNvidia Control Panel. If it doesn't work, tryuninstall GeForce Experience(if you don't use ShadowPlay) because that thing is a bloatware! Unfortunately forAMD users, there are a lot of times Iffy games just won't work properly with AMD cards. Your best shoot is towait for an update.Plz Rate this up for the bug Steam is currently having on this GameApparently if you buy theNormal verof the game, you will get theFull Deluxe Packfor free. (Just check the Game Folder before you start rating down)EDIT: The bug has been fixed"

For newcomers, if you can put up with how contrived the story can be, it may be worth a shot thanks to the exclusive content. Fairy Fencer F: Advent Dark Force added much needed and requested changes, but not everything seems to have been addressed with this re-release. The different paths you are able to take add more depth to the already well told story. Though it more often feels like a Director's Cut than a true remake, 'Advent Dark Force' nonetheless turns a flawed PS3 RPG into a stronger experience overall, making it the absolute best way to play 'Fairy Fencer'. The story has been made a great deal more interesting, playing with concepts that the original only hinted at, and the combat has been given a big shot in the arm thanks to the expanded party sizes and rebalanced difficulty. The game's biggest issue is that it feels like it could've been improved a great deal more than it has, leaving us with a game that's good, but falls just short of greatness. Still, it's a worthwhile adventure that lays down enough strong groundwork that could lead to a truly excellent sequel.FINAL VERDICT: 4/5Advent Dark Force went all-out in order to make the most definitive version of Fairy Fencer F that it possibly could. This title should be a no-brainer for fans of the original Fairy Fencer F, and I would also recommend it to anyone in the market for a good JRPG. Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force provides enjoyable gameplay, memorable characters, and a branching story good enough to warrant multiple playthroughs – and hey, isn’t that all that matters?"

76561198038371482,Recommended,524580,30795549,Posted: 28 March,all,Rat 13,"Original Fairy Fencer F was a game that made fun of JRPGs: tropes, storytelling, charecters etc etc etc. And while Neptunia did it better, FFF had it's own charm and was qute enjoyable in it's own way. But not without flaws.Luckly, all those flawas are gone in Advent Dark Force! Story of original route is much more fluid, characters are better established and developed, two new routes, better combat and tons more fanservice.In short, if you liked original Fairy Fencer F -- ADF is must have for you. If you like IF + Compa games (Or at the very least Neptunia series) -- check this one. If you want a simple, lighthearted game with decent humor, you may want to consider FFF ADF as future purchase."
,Not Recommended,524580,32887210,Posted: 27 June,all,renderb,"Although I very much enjoyed the original Fairy Fencer F I can't recommend this port in its current state. It has several technical issues, mostly graphical in nature, that in my opinion do not make up for the gameplay improvements and extra content.This game version is so blurry I can't play it without starting to feel ill. This blurring is clearly visable in screenshots, but it's far worse in motion. Because of the limited configuration options there was nothing I could do to fix this.For me some settings also didn't work: Regardless of how it is set in the menu camera control was always inverted.I'd strongly recommend you get the original Fairy Fencer F version instead, or pick this up on ps4 instead."

,Recommended,524580,30349521,Posted: 5 March,all,Nepsi,"As an other of both Fairy Fencer F and Fairy Fencer F: Advent Dark Force, I can safely say this version is the one you should get over Fairy Fencer FIn this game, you get+ Original story+ 2 new routes+ New Characters+ More areas+ More story to the original story whilst keeping it the same+ Better graphics (Although, more demanding, if you can run Megadimension VII, you can run this no problem)Although original owners weren't given a discount, I generally didn't mind paying full price, I like Compile Heart/Idea Factory games like this one, the battle system is similar to Hyperdimension Neptunia.I really enjoyed the 2 new routes added to the game as it adds more to the series itself, and I really enjoyed the Evil Goddess route more as that adds 2 brand new characters to the series that we don't meet in the Goddess and Vile God route, it's more hard though, as you have to complete either the Goddess route or the Vile God Route to get additional fairies to get the Evil Goddess route, you'll need to be pretty strong for the Evil Goddess route as well as it's bloody hard. Like, it's really really hard.Compile Heart and Idea Factory, keep this series going, I seriously love it and want to see it continue after the Evil Goddess route."

,Recommended,524580,34379516,Posted: 20 August,all,❤Nowaru-sama❤,"TL;DRThis remake of the original Fairy Fencer F adds 2 routes, graphical improvements and other minor improvements. Over all, I personally really enjoyed the two routes, although they do have some flaws, like very little character development for some new characters. The game is somewhat buggy, but it's not a very big deal. All and all, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes JRPGS or is a fan of IF and CH (probably their best game in my opinion)Long ReviewStoryThe game follows our protagonist named Fang, who accidentally became a Fencer and is tasked with collecting all the furies and reviving the goddess in order to make the world a better place. Along the way, he meets all kinds of characters, good and bad. The game is split up into three routes. The Goddess Route, The Vile God Route, and The Evil Goddess Route. The Goddess route was in the previous game and remains mostly unchanged, and the two new routes are very interesting and I enjoyed them a lot, though they are pretty flawed. The writing is what you would expect from IF and CH, a lot of jokes, but it does has it's serious moments and overall, I think that the writing is great, while being very similar to the Neptunia franchise.GameplayThe gameplay is a turn-based RPG. You can have up to 6 characters at a time and you must choose between regular attacks which you can customize, various skills and magic abilities, or wait if you are too far from the enemy or don't have what to do. When you take damage, a tension gague builds up, and when it reaches a certain point, your character can Fairize, which increases their stats and unlocks a ultimate ability. Each ability has an elemental atribute, and some enemies are weak or strong to certain elemental atributes. Regular attacks also change the shape of your weapon, and, just like with the elemental atributes, some enemies are weak to certain types of weapons. If you hit the enemy with a certain weapon enough, you will trigger a Avalanche Attack where your characters gang up on an enemy and unleash their combos on them. The enemy also has a guard gague, and when that is brought to zero, the enemy takes increased damage, but the guard gague builds back up over time. Over all, it's very similar to the Neptunia series, with some differences, and I really enjoy the battle system.SoundtrackThe soundtrack in this game is really fantastic. The opening is great, all the endings are amazing and the boss themes and dungeon themes are all really awesome. I highly recommend buying the soundtrack, it will not dissapoint you.OptimizationThe optimization of this game is what you would expect from IF and CH, not good. The game is filled with various bugs, graphical glitches, and game breaking bugs like the now fixed July 1st bug which didn't allow for the game to start up if your calendar was past July 1st 2017. Luckily, the developers quickly released a patch and fixed it. And a lot of people, including me, are having trouble with the frame rate, and crashing. This is easily the weakest part of the game.Pros-Good Story-Good Gameplay-Pretty long-Great Soundtrack-Pretty Good English Voice ActingCons-Bad character development at times-Bad optimizationOverall Score9.5/10. Highly recommend."

Its a pretty good game, and a great intro to JRPGs. Adding to that, the fact that you can change both vocals and subtitles to Japanese makes it nice little practice for someone interested in/ studying Japanese, like me. The gameplay is good, solid, typical turn-based JRPG. Came as a nice change of pace if you look at the games I play.Art style is pretty good.Overall, its not a bad game, and with the Complete Deluxe being $14.76 for the game and all of the DLC, it really is not a bad deal.

For instance when exploring dungeons the door opening animation begins and then i can't walk in the door while the door is still opening, even though there is enough room to go through. Also using your weapon during dungeon exploration takes a fraction of a second but i can move for another half second after swinging. The graphics in the dungeon aren't terribly great either.I understand that in these types of games the gameplay isn't usually the focus as much as the cutscenes. The cutsences are comparitivley fluid and well presented compared to the presentation of the dungeons. To me it seems like a visual novel with a game inbetween, i guess that what people play these for though right?The reason for my negativity towards the gameplay is probably because im used to games like darksouls where movement is more free, I just have to take a step back and realise that this game isn't about getting from A-B.All I'm saying is these developers could work a bit harder on some of these facets.I give this game 7/10, maybe it'll grow on me..."

The characters are all fun and memorable, heck even the main guy is cool (main characters are often bland). The gameplay is fun, graphics are gorgeous, soundtrack is great, story is engaging, and then you get see a bunch of cute girls (and guys if you like guys).

The scenary of each and every map was mind boggling and really impressive as you can see every detail. The factors in every scenary made every map special such as metal scraps pierced from the cracked groud or the lanterns that compliment the starry night.

I would say the optimization is slightly more balanced compared to Nepu VII but it still sucks. Barely any graphics options to adjust)3D Graphics: 3/10 (Dreadful, low-quality textures, asset and polygon count, decent quality character models, graphics are similar to Nepu VII but the dungeons look worse off than Nepu VII3D Animation/Physics: 2/10 (Some odd animations and the physics in the game feels very dated. 3D cutscenes are a pain to watch and detract from the immersion)2D Graphics: 10/10 (Top notch detail in 2D elements like Nepu VII)2D Animation: 9/10 (Nice breathing, mouth and eye animations. They are very fluid and give the characters much more emotion)Soundtrack: 6/10 (Considered poor compared to other Neptunia games. There are a few nice tracks. The soundtrack does not quite fit the dungeon or mood of the conversation sometimes)Plot/Story: 8/10 (Plot is fairly straightforward, nothing too special or deep about it. However, one thing they improved was that the 3 different endings or routes are actually different. There is actually actual content for each of the endings compared to most other Nepu games where only the true ending is the only ending that is worth spending your time to get it)Characters: 7/10 (Most of the characters are quite unique and most of them have an interesting backstory to them)Memes/References: 8/10 (Pretty funny memes and references)DLC: ?/10 (You get the DLC to make the game easier. Contains mostly OP armour and fairies )Overall Rating: 7/10 (Recommended to any JRPG fan and newbies to this genre. Game is similar to Nepu in terms of how the battle system works. You can expect about 20 hours of gameplay for each ending and lots of laughing although there are some parts that are quite dark.)"

And a bit of a warning, similar to Hyperdimension, the game plays like a Visual Novel. You can still explore dungeons freely, but if you're expecting an open world mechanism and cutscenes such as Final Fantasy or Tales of series, I suggest rethink about buying this.The most appealing change at first glance is the graphics, which looks better.But there's some kind of...""bloom"" thing that can't be disabled (if you ever played Megadimension, you know what I meant. I think this thing is already in the original as well).The only graphics settings available are: Resolution, Outline Render and Shadow Render or something like that. So yeah, it's not really that specific, which is kinda meh for me.The story is still the same as FFF, but more refined. Nice and fresh as usual.With the addition of few more routes which I haven't unlocked.As for the gameplay, it plays almost the same as the original FFF, but now you can use 6 characters at the same time!And no, it doesn't mean that we're overpowered. The battle itself isn't that boring, especially at higher difficulty, which makes you pray everytime it's the enemy turn, so that they won't deal critical damages. (Personal experience, their crit multiplier at times is x10).Character customization varies only costume and accessories.Known issues:-Glitching graphics at the world map (Not to major, since we don't spend more than 10 minutes in the world map).-Harley's Bullet Storm causing to crash (Shame, but the animation can be skipped for temporary solution. Hoping for patch).-There are times where the game just stopped for a few seconds, but it doesn't crash. Consider it lag of some sort.These issues doesn't really affect my own gameplay experience, but I really hope it can be fixed with some update patch.All in all, if you like simple JRPGs, buy. Or wait till bigger sale."

Obviously got caught up with FF7 back in the day and I occasionally try these things just to see if I can recapture that magic. I had high hopes for this one. But... Nope. In short, I’m sure fans of this genre will have fun but I got bored of the repetitive gameplay.So far as JRPGs are concerned, Fairy Fencer is kind of OK. It's pretty enough and the gameplay is that traditional combination of grind and skills development, but the lack of diversity of monsters and incredibly repetitive gameplay just isn't offset by the lack of story. I never felt invested in the characters and wasn't even bothered when a character or two are removed from the party for ""story"" reasons. I also found the partially voiced character interactions only served to act as a distraction; one of the other would have worked so much better.With that said, the Earth Forming ability is a really cool feature and permits the player to use multiple swords to change the statistical impact of a dungeon; making the creatures easier or increasing the loot drop rate for example. It adds a dimension to the game that I’m sure JRPG fans will enjoy.Overall not my type of games. I really did try very hard to get into it, but when I’m looking around a dungeon and I find myself fighting the same group of monsters for the umpteenth time I'd had enough. It did keep my interest for a little while though and I’m sure if you are a fan of this style of game, you’ll have some fun.I don’t want to mark this game up or down but since it’s not my thing I’m going to give it a thumbs down."

(My personal favorite since it accounts for defense before taking away from fairize charge and also made it look nicer.)Changed the story in certain ways introducing some characters earlier on along with adding new routes.Then there is the larger amount of people you can have in combat.I just need to come back to this, this game crashes so god damn much, what I originally said doesn't really cover it. This can happen randomly after finishing a battle and I've had this happen at least 5-7 times."

This is one of the worst ideas ever thought of in a game and people should be ashamed to considere this a good game with Game blockers like this.       IM stuck in my game and i eaither have to find a way to cheat the item into existance  toyal away and hope i win the lottery or start a new game all because of one stupid quest that is labeled unimporatnt by people but apperently you need to complete all the pub quest to even complete the game.      BAD game bad idea   Dont revole your game around RNG loot.

The title is misleading, and it's just a remake of the same dam game as the first one, and it's NOT EVEN STABLE!! it's riddled, and I do mean RIDDLED with bugs! I swear the devs put the bugs in ON PURPOSE just to anger the customers. I like the first Fairy Fencer because it was a good game and it ran flawlessly and still does.Do not waste your money on this game when you can get the first FF for a lot cheaper.This is the LAST game I will buy from IF/Compile Heart. They just lost my trust, and THEY lost a customer!!!"

This was a big step up from the first game, additional difficulties, 2 new story campaigns, able to use 6 over 3 characters in battle.  The list goes on.I leveled up into the wee hours of the night to fight the mian story on inferno mode.  And beat everything with my lv 900 party.  It was an amazing feeling.The only downside like with all Compile Heart games is that there is a ship of text, but here it makes it feel that much better to know these characters.  I do not mind the novel part of this rpg."
