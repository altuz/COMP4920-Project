Then things started to get emotional, not in that unnecessarily (and annoying) drama way, they happened naturally. So to me, Alicemare turned out to be a cute and creepy little game with a few hard a*ss puzzles to solve. It was enjoyable even tho it wasn’t what I expected at first. The hidden scenes and endings were good too.8/10. I came for the creepy atmosphere and ended up staying because of the good story and the feels too."

The art of the characters is cute and the overall feel of the game is just nice altogether.The game was developed by the same people who created LiEat which is one of my most favourite RPG's with its cute art style its little simplisitc gameplay and the characters.  The story is well driven and makes you think hard and deep. The game has some quite difficult Riddles which will definitely pose as quite a challenge but its also fun.The game like LiEat is quite cheap and offers a fun short story which is worth the price, I'd reccommend this for anyone who likes a good challenge and have a interesting and soft-core horror story."
,Recommended,524850,29390556,Posted: 20 January,all,h0tsp4ce,"TL;DR, it's cheap and probably one of five (out of a thousand) games that I'd give a 10/10.Reading the other reviews I seem to be a bit of an outlier as this is my first game from this Dev. I thought, ""Ah, it's cheap, art looks cute, might as well pick it up."" NNnnn! Alicemare was surprisingly well done. At a glance it seems like a run of the mill RPGmaker game that you've played a thousand times but there is something imbued in it which made it so fun for me to play.I've never used this word in a review before as it's extremely difficult for me to qualify any game with it, but Alicemare can be described as nothing else but charming. The draws into fairytales and stories we all know and love were done extremely loosely to remove any tactlessness whatsoever. The challenges were just challenging enough to be entertaining and the story delivered exactly what it sought out to do.This is not a heavy game. This is not an incredibly light game. This game is exactly what I thought it would be. If that doesn't deserve a 10/10 I don't know what does. I'm actually sort of sitting here in awe after playing this short but sweet story. So many games make themselves out to fit a certain genre, overhype the gameplay, or just hyperbolize areas that in the end leave the player wanting. This is the first game I've played since Higurashi (totally different genre, just using my own preferences for a base) that has been exactly what I thought it was going to be."

It has many endings (7 I think) and I cried for all ;-;It also shows some bugs on music file reading for me, but can be problem with my own pcI hope more people can enjoy this game & If you like it, also try LiEat made by miwashiba!"
,Recommended,524850,28509018,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,Shionpants,"After being quite disappointed in Miwashiba's previous game (LiEat - don't hate me, but I didn't really enjoy that one), I was really pleased to see that Alicemare is such a beautiful game. It has everything that LiEat lacked, in my opinion.The artstyle is really cute and perfectly fit for the game's fairy-tale atmosphere, the colors are delicate and nice (even though the menu is too bright) and I love how the whole cuteness contrasts the sad vibes it gives you. The characters' design is adorable(I still can't believe Miwashiba is the same illustrator that worked on Vocaloid's Gigantic OTN…).Oh, and the music is just amazing. You can really just close your eyes and listen forever to this OST. It's really relaxing but...somehow sad. Just like the game.The story is well driven and every single ending is pretty emotional. It's quite impossible to not feel bad for these characters after reading their background stories. I really liked the gameplay and how they choose to associate some fairytales with every character. I really suggest to play the children's endings first, then proceed with the others.There are some easy puzzles in it, nothing too difficult or frustrating in my opinion. Also you can play Tetris (with a...squirrel?), which is pretty cool.Despite being really short (I unlocked every achievement and completed the game in 4h) it tells different stories of different characters without being in a hurry. I liked it more than LiEat because of this: it's short, but complete, it tells different stories without forgetting the ""main"" plot and it's never boring.I won't really call it ""horroresque"", but it's deep and emotional and sad. There's nothing really scary in it, no chases and super jumpscares. The sounds' volume is not high at all, if you're not into horror stuff don't worry, you won't be scared.I suggest to follow a guide, expecially if you're in the second half of the game, since there's a secret scene (which is also an achievement) - I won't say more, don't wanna spoiler anything. Also: explore e v e r y t h i n g. Check every single thing. Save a lot. Don't miss any important object, otherwise you'll have to restart the game if you want to unlock certain achievements/stuff.To sum up, it's quite a beautiful game that should be played, expecially if you enjoyed games like Ib or Mad Father; it leaves you with a bitter sad taste in your mouth and you'll want to hugeveryonein the game.Well, maybe you won't hug Cheshire Cat..."
,Recommended,524850,32984921,Posted: 29 June,all,Melusca,"This is one of these strange, slightly-surreal-with-a-bit-of-horror Japanese adventure-not-RPG-despite-the-engine games, similar to Yume Nikki or Ib. Yes, I know I need to cut down on the dashes.The title (a combination of Alice and nightmare, nothing to do with horses, for better or worse) is slightly misleading, since there aren't actually many elements taken from Alice (mostly the White Rabbit and the Cheshire Cat), but on the other hand the inspirations from classic fairytales (Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, etc) are numerous. Yes, I know I also need to cut down on the brackets.The story takes place in some kind of institution for children with ""issues"" (not exactly an orphanage, nor a hospital, but something along these lines), which quickly becomes entangled with a nightmarish world with a fairytale flair. While not relying on jumpscares or an overly unsettling atmosphere, it kinda reminded me of Silent Hill, if Silent Hill was written with children in mind that is.Visually, although I found the mapping average, the color tones really reinforced the atmosphere. Not as well as it was done inLiEat(the second game from Miwashiba), but still pretty well.The gameplay is mostly composed of puzzles and riddles, some of them being fairly well-known (like that river where you have to ferry across a wolf, a sheep, and some kind of extremely rare and precious lettuce without any being eaten by their natural predator). If you have an affinity for logic and math you'll breeze through, if not, well, there's still bruteforcing or walkthroughs.This was originally a free game, which is still available for free in English onthe translator's site. You can check it there if you're interested, although I recommend buying it on Steam to show support for the dev if you liked it (in that case be sure to checkLiEatas well). The Steam version is mostly the same, though it comes with the usual features like achievements or cards.+ Interesting twist on classic fairytales+ Great atmosphere+ Multiple endings- Pixel hunting now and then- Some puzzles can be hard to grasp7/10 If you like the kind of games I laboriously described in my first paragraph, try this one, it's one of the good ones. Yes, I know this succession of ""one""s is hardly proper English."

,Not Recommended,524850,30628762,Posted: 19 March,all,kaiscarfo,"I really wanted to love Alicemare.The aesthetic is adorable and creepy all at once. Throughout the game there's an atmosphere of ""something is watching you/you're being followed"", withut jumpscares, or chases, or gore. The characters give you just enough to make you want to uncover your story.Unfortunately the story is not very cohesive. I found it hard to follow the plot, each individual story seemed disjointed from the overarching plot, I missed a bunch of the objectives because they weren't clearly outlined (ex. finding all the XXXX). The story, from what I could gather, was rather confusing and pretty shallow. A lot of stuff was left vague and unexplained at the ending, which may be an encouragement for multiple playthroughs, but there's not enough alternative content there for me to warrant playing again.I would still recommend this game if you want something cute/creepy to play but overall it's a no from me."

Anyways this game is not that long but for what I got I really enjoyed it. The story is more dark and sad than scary but you know what that is not a bad thing by any means. It has a great story to it and I had fun with some of the puzzles. So yeah if you want a little time killer and enjoy a dark story, by all means, pick up this game!"

There are multiple endings with characters that suit the dark, depressing atmosphere. The puzzles are indeed challenging, but certainly stress relieving once you are able to come to the conclusion. The best part is the soundtrack, it is well constructed and suits each moment well. It is perfect and is worth the price !"

As Allen explores the school on his first night he uncovers a gateway to a new world of dreams and nightmares.Review:7/10Alicemare is a great short story-rich game. Its wasn't horror which I was glad about but it still had a spooky feel to it. I give so much credit to the developer because they did a great job of balancing fantasy (innocent theme) and harsh topics like sucide, murder and abuse (dark theme).The game has incredible great content for a short game. They included peom, riddles and short fairy tale stories that related to the story really well. The story had a great ending and conclusion.If you are still unconvined (or enjoyed this game) I suggest playing the game IB. Its an rpg like this, very similar and also free. (not on steam tho)"

It's a game that makes you think, full of riddles, fairy tale/nursery rhyme references, and multiple endings/achievements that will cause you to have to save a lot, or play through again.

The fact that this isn't strictly a horror game but rather horror-esque, with an incredibly eerie atmosphere and in depth haunting story, had me hooked right from the start. 8.5/10, my only complaint being the game wasn't long enough."

And wow, Alice mare still took my breath away even after all this time. I've been a fan of Miwashiba for a really long time now--their arts, PVs, games, they all amaze me. And this was their first game, too, so when it was first announced I got really excited and immediately played it once it got translated. All I could say is that Miwashiba didn't leave me disappointed.Even though it's their first game, it's quite astounding. Miwashiba drew all the beautiful arts and made the wonderful story. The story, although quite sad and emotional, is fascinating. It teaches you about some deep stuffs that you probably haven't thought of before in your life. The puzzles aren't hard, though at least a few of them are hard... Other than that, the game has both of my thumbs up, so I definitely recommend you trying it."

The story that is slowly revealed is very intriguing, and definitely one of the best parts of the game.  The characters are nicely developed as well, and it's easy to get attached to them.  There are also several puzzles in the game, but they aren't too hard to figure out.Overall I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of RPG Maker games.

,Recommended,524850,34784967,Posted: 6 September,all,Dyomaeth,"From Disney's cutesy version of ""Alice in Wonderland"", to Tim Burton's gothic and creepy adaptation, we all have had some type of contact with Lewis Caroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"", and Alicemare is just another worthy addition to this list.Alicemare's themes are heavily leaning on creepy, and the cute artstyle can take quick turns to the dark and negative. The story is the game's strongest point. It's quite compelling and has the flavor of some other ""fairy tale gone dark"" games like Kingdom Hearts. Yes, that might sound like a strange comparison, but starting from the amnesia ridden protagonist, through the booming orchestral musical soundtrack, to the addition to references to other fairytales (Snow White and Hansel & Gretel, to name a few..) and the discussion on ""what's one's soul contain?"", it really seems the two games are rather similar.Alicemare is quite short and light on features, though, and while it uses an RPG engine, there's no combat or character progression. There is an inventory and it purely serves the purpose of the completion of puzzles. The game does have multiple endings though, so the story can be seen from multiple angles."
,Recommended,524850,27241398,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,Krakken4,Well... its more sad than i would have imagined. Would have prefered it if it were similar to Lieat (which it is in some ways).Controls feel clunky but you get used to it. Nice story though the end felt a bit rushed and... convenient i guess? The puzzles are nice and makes you think quite a bit. Though you should save before doing any of them. It was fun. And sad. like really really sad. So i am not really sure whether i was glad to play this. I am sure i enjoyed it overall but im just one of those people who doesnt like to feel sad at the end of a game. Though bittersweet would be more accurate. I enjoyed Lieat more cause it was less depressing. But i know lots of people kinda like that so im not one to judge. I'll give it a 8/10. Worth the price.

,Recommended,524850,29709925,Posted: 4 February,all,Nanashi,"This is by far one of my favorite games, both from an RPGMaker game type standpoint, and games in general. The story and characters are crafted with such love, and all characters have their own story to tell. None of the people you get to know are unimportant, and by the end, i'm sure you'll love at least one of the characters, if not all of them. The story is so well done, you can tell miwashiba put a lot of thought into the creation of such a world.Alice_mare is a bit of a classic game for me when thinking about RPGMaker type games, it was one of the first few I played when RPGMaker games blew up about 4 years ago. And it still holds up to this day. Playing through all the endings, getting all the acheivments, I had fun all over again.A word of caution though, this game is NOT a horror game. There are horror elements of course, but there is never going to be a moment where Allen gets chased by something, nor are there jump scares. If you thought this game might have it and wanted it for that reason, look elsewhere. There are some bad ends where you die, but they arent really scary, and you can mostly tell what you can interact with will kill you or it will be outright stated that something will kill you. Some of the game riddles can be hard to figure out a first time, at least, in my experience. Following vgperson's or one of the guides on this community to get past certain riddles might be needed. They weren't too frequent enough to be annoying, and I do feel the worst of it is in the beggining.There are collectibles in the game, but for the most part they are unnecessary to collect. You only need them for one ending. And in my opinion, most the hiding spots for the shards of xxxx aren't that difficult except maybe one.Out of all Miwashibas games, this one holds a pretty special place in my heart. I'd reccomend it to anyone with a fondness for rpgmaker games as long as they don't mind the afforementioned, along with anyone that loves fairytales, especially Alice in Wonderland. All characters are connected to one fairytale or another, and it's interesting to see how the game handles a character from such things. My favorite is the portrayal of Hansel and Gretel but I won't spoil that here."

I also disliked the unending back and forth travel for no clear reason. And I understand these are RPG icons but I played OneShot which the traveling their had a meaning and the story always got bigger as you progressed. This one, not so much, it felt like I just had to find the right person and hope they did something.So in the end: is it good? Yes very much.Do I really recommend this?

I did finish it, but I sort of rushed to the end using a walk-through just so I could see the conclusion. I usually like psychological, creepy games like this, but for whatever reason I just found it hard to get into. It could have been that the controls got very irritating when it came to walking through mazes. Or it could have been that I just didn't know what the heck was going on throughout the entire thing and there weren't enough relateable elements to keep me interested? The storyline has references to mother goose tales and Alice in Wonderland, but I'm not sure how it all ties together. Also, some of the puzzles were either A) incredibly easy or B) so incredibly hard, they didn't even make sense to me.  In a nutshell...I don't get it, but I wish I did. I liked the music though."

,Recommended,524850,34615994,Posted: 30 August,all,schinkenbrot™,"Well, well, well - Alicemare, a game I played when it came out back in 2013; yep folks, you heard me. And it wasn't even the ""original"" (japanese) version, as other people translated this free-to-play game. For free. Without needing 3 euros for a translation that's not as accurate as the others.Before I, actually, continue this very obvious rant, let me say something else: It's not a horrible game at all.Yes, not even three hours long, but filled with nice music and a story that's not explained until the actual end of this short journey in a weird place, filled to the brim with dangerous things and riddles, that prove to be just as life-threatening if you get them wrong. More importantly, it seems to be different fairytales put together in one strange world, and taking a new outlook on old things, such as Hansel (Rick) being a mere illusion made up by Gretel (Letty) or instead of killing Snow White (Stella) with a poisoned apple, the entire town has said fate with the exception of her. But then again, isn't that all just a dream? Yes, the game may lack some explanation, especially as to what XXXX could be, and what we - as Allen - have been robbed of, and if the Cheshire Cat is even speaking the truth when it tells us that he was it who took our memories, or was it the incident that got described later on in Davids dairy? We don't know, that's for sure - and we probably will never know, after Miwashiba stated that there was no intention to go back to this game, or making games at all, which is quite sad. I enjoyed the artstyle a lot back then, I still do, and it all looks very clean and neat, even when it isn't.Except for that there isn't much too say about this, as I've probably mentioned a spoiler or two already, and taking away all the fun wouldn't be nice. However, as much as I love this game, it's not worth the money you could be spending on something else and I'm not going to change my mind about that; though, the review is gonna be a rather positive one (as I do still recommend playing it, but buying it DOES seem like a waste of money if you can get it for free), you would be better off if you don't buy it."

I also enjoyed the riddles a fair bit.Each kid's story is kinda hard to follow due to their story being told in small chunks that you can't look at again without going back to see it.My main problem I had was the game gave me no reason to really care when someone got hurt in some way, sure I knew their past and how they ended up in the same place as me but there was still no 'human connection' made with them that would give reason for me to care about them. It was just ""Hi my name is [name]"", puzzle, [chunk of backstory], puzzle, [chunk of backstory], puzzle,[event that hurts the kid emotionally], death, [chunk of backstory] repeated several times and it honestly felt kinda annoying after a while as after the second dude you catch on to the pattern and it just feels kinda boring."

,Recommended,524850,28888916,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,ArtemisHunt,"Alicemare is an adventure fortunately with very little adventure game logic. Adventure game logic is the primary reason that I generally tend to dislike adventure games. You play Allen (though you'll spend half the game being called Alice). You're at some kind of boarding school(?) where you hang out with other problem children with horrors in their pasts. Apparently this ""Nightmare Syndrome"" is killing people in their sleep. You... somehow... find a way to enter the dream world. Then you adventure game it up to solve puzzles. As you solve these puzzles, you are rewarded with little cutscenes that tell you the backstory to the other children at this boarding school. It's a good design choice for character exposition because instead of an exposition dump you get to live the life through the child's eyes. Almost makes you feel sorry for the kids, as they all have somewhat uncomfortable backgrounds. But hey, the game has ""Horror"" as a tag, so ya get what you saw on tin, amirite?There's a white rabbit and a cheshire cat but that's really about where the similarities with ""Alice in Wonderland"" end, after the name.Honestly, I don't like the execution. The art for some of the maps feels a little too ""RPG Maker-esque"" if that makes sense. Not only that, but some of the maps themselves feel a little too ""RPG Maker-esque"". I remember there was this one time where I had to walk through an entire maze which was pretty much copy/pasted rock sprites. I would've been more satisfied with a solid looking wall. The guy did LiEat as well and there was a maze section in the game that could've been handled better too. But if I recall correctly, that was something like a series of wooden floors with a black background and glowing lights. It had more ambience than this.The game is filled with little puzzles. There was a literal copy/paste of the Wolf-Lamb-Cabbage bridge puzzle. There were a couple of math puzzles. A murder mystery with very little mystery. A spot-the-difference game, can you believe it? I think of these as gimmicks that serve only as barriers between me and story progress. The adventure game puzzles were a better way to progress.Let's see, since I know the guy's past work LiEat, allow me to compare the two. First - the characters in LiEat were far more interesting. I think if you contrast Alicemare to LiEat, you get a game that's about a setting rather than about characters. In my opinion, LiEat is the far superior one. While the battles were kind of a waste of time, I feel like the characters and story are better explored in LiEat than they are in Alicemare. On top of that, the deduction game was a better way to move me between set-pieces than a stupid spot-the-difference game. LiEat had more interesting characters overall.The game is short, and I'll edge on the side of the recommend because it does have its appeal. The art direction and music are well done. I guess My problem is that the story just feels so weak and even at the end I wasn't satisfied. Maybe a sequel will come out, as it did with LiEat. The characters are forgettable, possibly because they were flat characters upon introduction with the purpose of being fleshed out during gameplay. But nothing really stands out. There's nothing that says ""Yes, this character had this happen to them and that's why they're a massive tosser"". There's just ""I am a tosser and this happened in my past"".Overall, I give it a pass but only just."

My mistake.What you can look forward to:- The railroad plot of the game that gives you multiple discisions at every turn, but then forces you to choose one specific path anyways.- The unpaced puzzles slapped into this game that don't fit into the game's atmosphere at all. I mean, tetris? Spot the differences? Why?- Backtracking. You can't pick up the mug until you talk to the girl who says she's thirsty and then draw water from the well and then examine the bucket beside the well to realise that you need a more convienient container for the water to give to the girl.- Steam cards. That's like a refund, right?An hour was more than enough time wasted. Even if the game gets better, my time would be better spent playing a real horror or RPG or literally anything else in my library as opposed to hoping that the game improves. 3/10 will probably leave it running to get all the steam cards."

There's some decent replayability since after you finish one ending of the game, the point at which the endings diverge is easy to find your way back to (easier still with a handy save), and curiousity will get the best of you trying to get each ending's Achievement.Alicemare's main mechanic is a few simple puzzles and riddles that advance your character through each of his companion's questlines, called Worlds, that are supposed to be journeys through their hearts that reveal their dark secrets and what motivates their quirky behavior at face. The puzzles aren't punishingly difficult, and all you'll need to feel a sense of satisfaction in this game is to pay a bit of attention to the character speech screens and cutscenes. The little bit of frustration that you will feel comes from needing to check [spam the Z key to see if there are any relevant items around you] absolutely everything, or make multiple trips through hallways and several rooms in order to speak to different NPC's to obtain items or complete mini-quests. It is still a game at the end of the day, so there's some annoying grind to get to the meat of it.Value for the price is fantastic, particularly because Alicemare and LiEat, the other game from this developer, are always on some kind of sale.It's cheap, (fairly) easy, and plays fast- why wouldn't you get it?"

I cared nothing for the main character Allen since so little was revealed about him other than he lost his memory and he doesn't really react to anything...at all; I would have liked to see atleast a little dialogue from him. Also everything was so disjointed and there were so many ideas about murders and curses, demons and otherworlds that I still don't fully understand what happened. I conclussion as to why all the kids are together and why Teacher is the way he is is tossed in super close to the end so it's completely forgettable; the secret ending helps a but not by much.

Some parts you don't know what to look for unless you click on all the clickable things just to trigger an event, and sometimes it feels like the dev just took the events and put it randomly in objects and you have to turn every stone just to find it. I'm looking at you,Stella World, the piano part to be specific.Also inStella World, at the graveyard maze, I had trouble going through small walk way (between two gravestones the dev put so delicately close to one another, thanks dev :y) because the walk cycle is to darn fast.TL;DR: If you like a good story, pick it up.

I could figure almost every one of them out myself, and otherwhise there's that useful guide you can use ;)The characters were very likeable and they all had a good backstory. Good music (for me especially El Paradiso), and the artwork is pretty good and really fit in with the game.Pros- Good story- Likeable characters- Good music- Difficult puzzlesCons- Story can be a bit difficult to follow sometimes- It's sometimes annoying that it's hard to get into thight spaces (gameplay)I highly recommand this if you like dark games or games with a deeper meaning behind it."

The story is very interesting and I love the characters! I would definitly reccomend this game!"

I loved it so much, the art is absolutely breath taking and very cute. I would highly recommend it to people thinking of getting it.The puzzles are not too simple yet not too hard either, it's perfect if you want your mind to think a little more than usual.The characters were all very nice, and I absolutely adored getting to know them and their stories. My favorite thing was guessing what Fairytale they matched, [some were able to be guessed at first sight but it was still enjoyable knowing].I loved everything about it, there were times I had to search up a walkthrough or had to write things down, but that's usually what happens during these games if you're lazy like me haha.What else to say? Pretty much just that I absolutely adored it and I 100% recommend it. Everything was great.The only real issue I had was with the characters movements, usually, there would be a grid for the characters to step with, but, there were also half steps in this game, which only caused it to be a bit frustrating trying to get into tight spots. But otherwise, I had no trouble."

It's too difficult, but it makes it a great game to play when you have some free time and don't want to commit to a larger game.The only place I complain, and complain hard, is the engine and the few settings. Options are virtually non-existance. There are a few performance settings, but all they do is limit the framerate. I find this to be a very bad thing, as someone with lesser knowledge on settings could set the ""highest performance"" setting and you're stuck with 15 frames a second."

This game ripped my heart out, stomped on it a few times, and then threw it into a well of pain. While that may seem like a bad thing, it's the exact opposite. The puzzle's were confusing, as I'm not the smartest of folks, but that's what searching up a guide is for.The soundtrack was pretty good. It's better to wear headphones to fully emerse oneself into the game though.I wouldn't describe Alicemare as a horror game. Sure, it has a few noises that could spook a fellow if they have their volume up loud. This game does has dark themes in it though. It's got an adorable style to it, but doesn't take the focus away from the story or gameplay.In all honesty, this has to be the greatest RPG game I've played. It took me a couple hours to play through, and I have managed to get all the endings, and most of the achievements. I do recommend it greatly."
