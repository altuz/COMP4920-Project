,Not Recommended,525380,33421538,Posted: 9 July,all,Ribbit,"Okay, to start, I did mostly enjoy playing this game... but there are some things that need to be discussed and reasons I wouldn't recommend this to a friend. To summarize, the game is not ready to be released. There are a plethora of bugs that are nearly inexcusable when selling a ""completed"" game. Not only bugs, but also game design decisions. I'll make this a simple pro/con list. (Although it says 8 hours played, I beat the game in less than 5. At least 3 hours were AFK in menus).Pros:+ Very nostalgic Castlevania feel+ Good art+ Multiple usable items/skills that can be unlocked+ Good enemy varietyCons:- Some chests (the ""rare"" ones) are empty. You will not be rewarded for finding some of the rarest chests in the game.- Incorrect map programming. There will be multiple zones of the map where you exit a room and end up 2 rooms away instead of the correct room.- Missing/Poor textures. Some platforms don't have textures yet and hidden walls underwater have a very awkward texture that makes them stick out like a sore thumb.- The weakest enemies in the game are some of the strongest and will make the first few minutes very frustrating.- Bosses are way too easy... I beat the final boss without much of a problem while only having beaten one other boss (I didn't even need this). When I beat the boss, I only had like one health upgrade and one stamina upgrade.- Although there are many skills, your main auto attack, double-jumping (unlocked) and health potions are all you need to beat the game. Literally.- Enemies don't have anything to fight against your ""cheese"". Almost every enemy in the game can be ""cheesed""... except for the first/weakest mob in the game and their upgraded counterpart. They are the only difficult enemies because of their extreme speed, damage, and inability to be read.- There appears to actually be ""debug"" stuff left in the game. Invisible portals, ""notes"" for where merchants should be... not sure if these were debug tools, but they didn't add anything to the game.- There's actually a point in the game where you can soft lock by getting stuck in a room if you don't have the ground smash yet. You'll have to quit the game and load back in to your last save.- The soundtrack. I muted the music in the first 5 minutes and played my own music. The music does not fit the game at all. If there are better songs later in the game... then that might be nice. But I doubt it.So, if the game actually required me to defeat all of the sub-bosses before the final boss, that'd make the game much more enjoyable. If all the bugs I mentioned were fixed, that'd also help. If the  last boss required anything more than the main auto attack, double jump, and health potions... that'd also be nice."

The gameplay is fun and challenging while consistently changing and adding mechanics for variety. It's true that there are certainly some bugs that I've come across, however this is something the developer has pointed out them selves and have and will continue to fix them. It's truely a great game that just needs some polishing and for the price of 4.99 (3.99 on sale) it's a steal. A lovely gem!"
76561198029887848,Recommended,525380,33448024,Posted: 10 July,all,DAVA,"Tricky and Fun(As of July 10)Devs stated that the game had to be pushed out, and to be honest it shows in some areas (including one of the early bosses sadly)That said, when you consider the price tag and the premise it's still quite fun. The gameplay is deep enough that you can't just play through the intro area and expect to be able to steam roll the game. It's very satisfying realizing the patterns of enemies and learning the areas. I played through the game without a working map, and it was still easy enough to navigate that I never felt lost because of the area diversity.Big up was the sense of power I had being able to access and trade well against the end boss.Though he was, in reality, the easiest of the bosses,It felt empowering to be able to learn his patterns and develop a sort of strategy.The vomit worm and the centaur king, on the other hand, felt unintuitive and a bit broken. Neither felt like my skill had anything to do with me winning, and they sort of felt more like a chore than something I needed to do with how little the fights were necessary towards fighting the end bossSome of the bugs I encountered were annoying, but the flow of movement and combat with the normal enemies showed me a great time for a great price"
76561197983163764,Recommended,525380,33356177,Posted: 7 July,all,BurnTheHorses,"Alright, so my initial opinion on Demon Peak was little. First there was no game data in the installation, then a game breaking save bug, then a boss that was just totally broken. After all the crap I went through for buying this on release and 3 hours in game, I have some new opinions.Let's start with the pros:Very fun, challenging combat with a good selection of moves and items at your disposal.Mostly well designed enemies that keep you on your toes and constantly changing your tactics.A beautiful, varied game world with great pixel art and a whole lot of style.Overall quite good level design with lots of secrets and interesting pathways.Awesome soundtrack that at times reminds me of Castlevania's tunes.Extremely helpful and quick responding devs that are dedicated to fixing any issues the game has.Cats.Onto the cons:Pretty damn steep learning curve that has you frustrated early on due to overly-aggressive enemies that do a ton of damage.Some very situational items that you just kind of forget about at timesSomewhat iffy sound design. Some sounds are just badly made.Sometimes overly confusing level layouts and long periods with no save points. (Could be a pro or con depending)An overall lack of polish (due apparently to the devs having to rush the game per the publisher's orders). Not too severe, but you can definitely feel it from the raw platforming, the rough inputs for some moves, and the rather minor bugs, such as a few platforms being invisible, one (optional at this time) boss being basically broken, and just a general clunkiness to everything. Like I said, not that severe honestly.Personal Con: A lack of weaponry. There's your basic sword, a hammer, a limited throwing axe and a boomerang ninja star. I personally would have liked to have another primary weapon or two. Though to be fair, there's a few moves that are sort of different weapons.Overall, for fans of pixel art games and metroidvanias, I'm going to say I recommend it fully. At $5.00, it's a very good purchase. It's only several hours long (depending) but it's generally a good time."
76561198035786126,Not Recommended,525380,33493964,Posted: 12 July,all,Dune Reference,"7/12/2017Disclaimer: I have not beaten the entire game.Let's talk about the good first. The character you play as is cool looking and the abilities you get are just as stylish and flashy. The character itself is fun to play with all the dashing and other movement abilities. The best part of the game is simply moving, and I found myself dashing and manuevering my way around a lot of the levels because movement was more fun than the combat.Now, the bad.1) The game is incredibly glitchy.Several times I would go into a save room and then on my way out, find myself in a different map somewhere else in the area. This was especially confusing right at the start since I thought it was a mechanic of the game, but when I had it happen elsewhere later I understood that it was just a bug of some sort and a very confusing one at that.Currently the dev has turned the map off since it wasn't working correctly, but that leaves the game a little hard to navigate. I ended up finding my way eventually, but there was a lot of backtracking through areas that had nothing in them, just because I'd forgotten.There was also a time where there was clearly supposed to be an invisible wall and instead was a large light blue rectangle full of 1's. See that here:http://i.imgur.com/I2Ya6l8.pngMultiple times I came to a hard-to-get-to chest and there was nothing inside. I'm not sure if this is a bug or just a laugh in the players face, but it's rather dumb.Also, as I was going into one of the boss rooms my fps dropped to like 2 and I had to slowly drop back down to the previous area for it to stop.I also remember several times I was standing on this air, as there was a dropdown-able spot, but it didn't put in the texture or something, so my character just floated.2) low effort artThere are several whole areas where the background is literally just black. Even if the point was to be pitchblack (which I'm not convinced was the intent) it needs some sort of flavor. There was also a pretty rediculously bad background of a skeleton which made me laugh and a send a picture to all my friends:http://i.imgur.com/X2h8tXo.png3) unpolishedMost of the game just simply feels unpolished. I feel like the little guys that throw aaxes in arcs throw them way too far/high and do way too much damage and are rediculously annoying. The mages are cool, but they generally suck as the player can just run at them and kill them before they do anything of worth; exception being the purple orb guys. Also, the health and gold pickup hitbox is pretty terrible. You have to stop your play significantly to wait for the orbs or coins to get collected; this was probably one of the most annoying things of all.OVERALL: Kinda fun at first, but terribly bugged and low effort art makes it horrendous. I would accept this if it was listed as an early access game, but as a full release this isn't okay. I do look forward to seeing if any of these things are fixed in the future, but as of now I would not recommend playing it."

I love how it looks, and if you're a pixel lover like me, you'll enjoy the beauty this game has to give. The mechanics aren't hard, but a little dull, you mostly attacvk then run away to avoid getting damaged, but if you like that then this is a must buy. i would recomend this game without any doubt in my mind. What are you waiting for? BUY IT."

76561198133859973,Recommended,525380,33595209,Posted: 16 July,all,DJBlazeWave,"(EDIT As Of 7/17/17 patch) - I gave the game another go and literally everything that i had stated in my negative review of this title has been fixed with today's patch to the game. I started a brand new game and was quite pleased with the fixes. I managed to beat this game in a little less than 3 hours, and i enjoyed every bit of it! I enjoyed myself very much. Will be going back to this game to find everything that i missed and grind for the rest of the achievements. Also, i will be giving this game a positive review now since the way it currently is thanks to the latest patch, it's definitely worth it now, and i could recommend it to anyone. Especially the oldschool heads such as myself. Love metroid and castlevania? Got $5 to blow? Get this now!(Before The Patch) - Coming from someone who has invested 5-6 hours into this game, and has even streamed it twice, i have to say that it has so much potential. But the game has so many bugs, glitches and issues, that i wouldn't recommend buying it as it is now until they patch the things wrong with it, Which i will explain it all in a sec. There is alot of bad i have to say about it, so just hear me out.It's not much to really explain on the setting of the game other than the fact that you are somewhat of a human samurai demon slayer that is trying to make his way out of a demonic mountain peak. The game is pretty much a metroidvania styled indie, so if you love metroid and/or castlevania, then this will interest you. But the amount of bugs in it's current build can certainly take the fun out of it.Literally within my first 3 mins of playing this game, I suddenly ended up in the foreground of the game, being able to walk through the whole world in the background of the stage without being able to see my character. With some constant fighting with the game, i managed to get myself back out somehow. There is also one particular area that you can reach with the demon wings in the beginning area of the game that causes this same bug as well. Another huge gripe i have with the game is that ever since i started playing, i have not been able to access the mini-map. According to the game, you're supposed to be able to access it by either holding your menu/inventory button, or tab if you're using keyboard. Or you can press the menu button, and just press your lb or rb buttons to get to the map. When you try to do it this way, you don't ever see a map. and holding the button does nothing either. So because of this, i literally have been playing thru the game barebones trying to remember where everything is on like some original nes metroid status. Myself loving oldschool type games, i tried to deal with this. But when there's a huge world in a game, and so much to explore and find, it can be quite frustrating to not have a map to go by.Another huge issue i have with this game is that i realized that sometimes when you enter certain areas (especially most save points) when you exit the save point, you could end up in a completely different area than where you previously were at. For example, lets say i was in The Heart (which is where you can shop for potions, skills and stuff) There is a save point there too. If i went in the save point and left back out, i could end up in the monestry(which is another area in the game). Times that this happened was extremely frustrating to me. And considering that i had no map to go by, it made it that much harder and stressful to try to find where i was before that bug happened.Another issue is the fact that Most treasure chest in the game don't give you anything. Chest are well hidden in this game, and some of them wont reward you anything once you open them. And the majority of the time when you do get something, it's usually either coins or potions. When you obtain a potion or a type of item out of chests, it doesn't tell you what it was that you picked up. So because the game doesn't do this, you have to go into your sub menus and see what it was that you picked up for yourself. Even healing items such as meats that come out of breakable objects such as candles don't tell you what they are. They just heal either your health or your essence (magic) depending on the type of consumable it is.Textures in this game can be a huge issue too. I found myself constantly having to restart the game because often times when going thru different sections and areas, the textures would disappear to the point that all i would see is my character and maybe some candles and the save cave if there was one around. Even when it doesn't do this, some of the textures on some platforms are not even visible, and most hidden areas that you would need to use a supermove to get thru seem to be pointless and either go nowhere, or offer anything.The very first enemy that you come across is a bit on the overpowered side. it's nearly impossible to take him out without taking any damage. Im pretty sure it's the first enemy. It's the ones that scream alot and leap out at you constantly slashing you with their claws. Once they are on you, it's a bit of a hassle.The music is not bad. The only bad thing i would probably have to say about it is the fact that you can hear it loop in some sections of the game. Aside from that, i don't really have much issues with it.The Overall gameplay is actually great. Trying my absolute best to cast all the negative things to the side, and using all the amount of patience that i possibly had, i was still able to enjoy the game. If it wasn't for the bugs, i could definitely enjoy it 10x more. It truly does feel like a successor to the oldschool castlevania games and metroid games. And even though the game is just a mere $5, i still couldn't recommend this to anyone until they fixed everything that i mentioned was wrong with it. I still dealt with it because i have alot of patience, but the next person may not take the bugs and issues with this title as lightly. Keep your eyes on this game though if they fix all the issues, Because it has MUCH potential."

The graphics and enemy designs are all really sharp and look pretty good considering the size of the team working on it.My issue is the combat. Not getting hit is impossible against certain enemies whose moveset is basically ""run at you and swipe"".Give it time. This game is a metaphorical piece of coal and in time it might be a little indie diamond."
,Not Recommended,525380,33621851,Posted: 17 July,all,Satire.,"Game is quite fun for a platformer; it has just the right difficulty to both the combat & the environment, the puzzles/area progression isn't ridiculously hard but is still satisfying to complete & work out.Sadly though the game was forcefully released as an unfinished game and will sadly only (most likely) see one patch (v1.1, released today) as the publishers don't seem to care too much for the game according to the devs, who just aren't able to work on the game.All-in-all the game's fun and I'd say a good purchase when it's $3~ on sale, but I feel it's a game that promised a lot more content than it will now ever get."

76561198116707297,Recommended,525380,35321861,Posted: 29 September,all,pook99,"As of the writing of this review the game has a mixed rating on steam.  Do not let that rating deter you from giving this game a shot, from my understanding when this game was released there were several bugs, such as maps that didnt work, save points which randomnly teleported you around the map, unfinished textures and other graphical bugs.  If I played the game in that state I probably would have given this game a negative review also, but all of these features have been fixed in the latest version.The game itself is a standard metroidvania, but a very well done metroidvania.  Like most games of this type you have a decently sized map to explore and as you traverse the map you acqurie new abilities that help you access new areas.  You have some standard stuff like a double jump and the ability to breathe underwater, and a few unique items like spears which are a ranged weapon but can also be stuck to walls to be used as platforms.Exploring the world is fun, you are always finding new upgrades and new combat moves which keeps things fresh, your character moves fast, the animation is fluid, and the controls are perfect.  Your character and his weapons look awesome and the world is varied with a wide variety of enemy types to fight.  You also get a some moves that are used with street fighter style inputs which I had a lot of fun with.   There are a total of 4 bosses, all of which are fun to fight and present a nice challenge.The game took me about 3 hours to beat, and I had an absolute blast playing it.  The combat is fun, the platforming is fast and precise, and the exploration is very rewarding.  If you are a fan of metroidvanias/hack and slash games there is no reason not to buy it, at full price it is $5 which is a steal."

I try and be funny in this so if you prefer text, written review belowhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrEz0HAJPHsThis game is basically Ninja Gaiden meets Megaman zero. Demon peak is a solid action platformer with metroidvania elements. The combat is tight, the enemies are diverse and the movement is incredibly fun. While the game has a few glitches lying about, none have affected me in any of my 3 play throughts of the game so I can't really comment on them.The aesthetic, artstyle and music of the game are very unique and really add to the overall appeal. I realy enjoyed the Samurai and feudal japanese feel to it, and the pixel art and animations accentuate this aesthetic perfectly. The music can be a little out of place, with the very first level having very out of place backing music but overall the soundtrack is solid. While there isn't much in terms of progression other than the secret health and essensce upgrades, the game has a fairly deep combat system that can make fighting enemies enjoyable even 14 hours in. It's a lot of fun to chain super moves together and to parry the fast attacks of enemies, even after doing it dozens of times.My biggest gripe about this game is the lack of replayability and late game content, with there only being 1 difficulty and new game plus being identical to the base game apart from keeping your upgrades. Overall, if the game added in more bosses, preferably very hard bosses that are optional, or more elite enemies on new game plus, it would be a much more complete experience. Apart from this you can't really buy that many new attacks and the secrets are a little lackluster, but the game puts core gameplay over extending the play time, which is admirable, but it makes it very disappointing when you've basically seen everything the game has to offer after 6 or so hours.As it stands, the game will definitely sate you for about 7 hours and I'm sure you'll enjoy your time with the it. If you enjoy megaman zero or valdis story at all you'll really enjoy this game. With that in mind, I highly recommend Demon peak."
76561197995669628,Recommended,525380,33424123,Posted: 10 July,all,Sorokonojka,"Demon Peakcan be a serviceable Metroidvania game but I would recommend waiting for few patches to get the optimal experience. Right now the game has a lot of glitches and developers seem to have forgotten to put items in some of the hidden chests. I actually killed the first boss with 1 hit (probably not intended). Most of the problems are easy fixes so I'll give the developers a chance to address it before I burn them with fire. Once you unlock couple powers the combat feels enjoyable enough but I think the biggest concern here is the amount of content. The game is 4-5 hours (much of it is backtracking) although you can also play New Game+ that has your stats carried over.(I replayed the game in Patch 1.1 and 90% of the glitches are fixed. Not gona rewrite the whole review but the game is in decent state. Win7 x64)CombatThe character starts with few moves which makes  a bad first impression .However, like with most games in this genre, you will find a lot more powers and upgrades overtime. Most of them are new moves and not just stat increases.Default dash controls are a little awkward but you can switch them in options to a more common set up. I think it plays fluidly once you get use to timing special skills .Most of the enemies can be beaten tactically if you know their weakness. There is only one enemy that just shreds HP bar regardless of how you play so developers will need to fix that.There are 4 bosses and 3 of them were very disappointing. I just did not feel like I had to use strategy for them. Perhaps developers need to rethink the hitboxes and balancing so I am not potion chugging for the win.Platforming ElementsWell, you start with only a jump & dash which is limiting. You will eventually find double-jump and few other mobility moves like fly-kick that will improve gameplay. I really like that you can get a spear-shoot power and then use the spear as a step. It certainly opens some interesting puzzle scenarios. Platforming gameplay was alright but they could have done a lot more with the idea.ExplorationI got to say that environments and stage design are mostly generic. It is just a couple caves with few different colors and little detail. I kinda assumed that caves were the first area of a bigger world but that was the whole game. Out of the few Metroidvania games that I played this might actually be the worst one in stage variety. There are some secrets around the map that have items and shrines that increase stats or give new powers.Music/ArtworkThe soundtrack was hit and miss for me. I liked a few songs and few other were just kinda there to fill in the gaps. You could argue that it does not fit the tone of the game. Also, it feels like the game does not have enough sound effects. Definitely not remarkable as a whole. As far as pixel art I have no problem with animation of the character or enemies. I just wish  the environment had more detail.Verdict 7/10Demon Peak seems very promising in the first few hours until you realize it's all you get. Overall it was not great but I enjoyed my time with it. The core gameplay is decent enough to expand so it all depends on how far developers will take it. Patch 1.1 fixed most of the problems so I bumped score from 6 to 7."

The game's difficulty has toned down a bit in a recent patch, but it's still challenging enough to be a great experience. Plenty of ability upgrades change up the combat. The sound track is really good, and enjoyable. The visuals are not bad, and reminded me of some of the old school games from the Super Nintendo era. I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good time (Did I mention it's only five dollars!?)."

Also it seems like there aren't all the planned health- and stamina-upgrades in the game yet, so I'm looking forward to future patches.Anyways, even with those few bugs and the forced ""hardmode"" (due to missing upgrades), the game is really fun to play if you like things like RogueLegacy and the DarkSouls-Series. It has a nice artstyle and ambient-music to it and the combat as well as the platforming is - after half an hour of learning enemy-behaviour and the controls - really enjoyable. The Bossfights are challenging and the Bosses themselves not necessarily easy to find, which makes exploring the areas a huge factor in this game.All in all I can easily recommend this game even at its current state. It was a relatively short, but enjoyable experience (4-5 hours if you search through every bit), but then again: What would one expect for the low pricetag of 5 bucks?"

But even though I do,I cannot recommend it in the current stateAs of 7/11/17For what the game is trying to be, a faithful remaster of SNES Castlevania/Metroid, it does a great job. You can feel the atomsphere from the level design and the musical score, though repeative after a few minutes or even cuts out randomly, does a good job tying in the darkness of the game. The game play itself is very solid and after mastering combat, the game will remind you often that you'll never really get stronger but your ability to handle enemies will get better.Sadly, that's all I have to really say that's good about the game in the current state. To start off the things terrible about this game would bethe lack of a map. I get it, you wanted to design a game in the Metrovania style...But why the hell isn't there an active map?! It's extremely difficult to remember when you're going in this game. Not only that, but the game also forces you toREMEMBERcertain spots of the game when you get a power-up to break it. This, as well as a lack of actual direction in the game(As I can gather, you can travel to any location and there's no real 'first location'), really break the game play apart.I also think finding the Demon's Lance ability is SO obscured that I doubt many players would even find it... That move alone has helped me gain so many secrets that I don't understand why it's tucked away in a rather awkward place...Next are parts of the map that are broken. I've found two places where the map will glitch you into the next area as an invalid object, surfing around and hoping you'd go back where you came. I had to restart my entire game because of it. On top of this, there are chests that don't actually drop anything. I don't know if this was an over-sight for the programmer missing chests or if they're meant to have nothing, but having a chest randomly sit in a hard to reach place with nothing in it is rather defeating.Finally, there are a few monsters in the game that cause great distress for me and I can't imagine how other players would handle it. In later areas of the game, smaller mobs will tick HP slowly and have a bit of stun, making them annoying on their own. In the mobs they roam in are a nightmare. I've died numerous times to floating eyes and freaking pirhanas because I couldn't dish out enough damage to either groups.I'm sure the developers are working hard on this game...

76561198124880936,Recommended,525380,33442072,Posted: 10 July,all,Power.,"From what I've played so far, I like the game.The combat takes a bit of getting used to at first, but now that I've gotten the hang of it and unlocked a few things it's actually pretty fun, though I still manage to die frequently mainly because I suck.The artstyle is amazing, everything looks great.The music is pretty nice. I didn't really like the tutorial music all that much, but the rest of the game's music so far fits pretty well, and sounds great.Exploration is nice too, though I did get lost a few times because I missed those crystal switch things you have to hit to open pathways.There are of course a lot of issues with the game. Frequent crashes, bugs, fullscreen option breaks the game, invisible platforms, missing sprites, inconsistencies with how some enemies will only spawn once while others respawn the moment you're off-screen, and a few level layout choices that are kinda bad(a place where jumping up takes you to a different room where you  immediately fall back down to the previous room onto a platform with the enemy respawning and hitting you when you land).Apparently the developers were forced to release the game early thanks to a contract issue with their publisher, and weren't allowed to just put it into early access, which is why there's a bunch of bugs in the game, and the developers are trying to fix most of them.So, if you're willing to give the developers the benefit of the doubt to fix all the bugs and get the game in a better condition, go ahead and purchase it and try out the working parts. If you would prefer to wait until they fix everything before trying out the game, then do that instead.Once all the bugs get fixed up I'll probably change my review."

,Not Recommended,525380,33439399,Posted: 10 July,all,TwitchUrBrandNewHero,"I'm just going to say that if you were going to buy this game it would be because it has ""Metroidvania"" in its description. I played for only a couple minutes and can tell you this the environments seems bland and simply made, the character controls loosely, ledges are perfectly parallel to each other and you are expected to jump up them, also something I found weird is that I was playing with a xbox one controller and the input commands were showing up as keyboard prompts. Also, when doing research about why the game isn’t “great” is because a publishing contract.If you really want to play a “Metroidvania” that is good get Dead Cells or Hollow Knight or wait for Chasm, Deaths Gambit, or something that I really want which looks Effin badass is Blasphemous. Honestly if you want a good game that just feels good right now get Dead Cells it is basically up to par with Castlevania Symphony of the Night or get that game.So, what really makes this game hard for me to play besides the combat and not being able to dash past enemies, is honestly the music, yea the music. When I play this game, it reminds me of some cheesy 16-bit games it mainly reminds me of the sounds of the Sega Genesis but not in an effective way. I think they were trying to go for some hardcore metal sound but without actual instruments it just sounds dated. Something that I suppose really made me not feel like this game was submersing was the fact that the enemies were stupid enough to just walk over ledges without code to safeguard themselves from their basic AI.So, my overall rating of this game. For now, I’m going to have to give it at least a 3/10 basically for the only good part about it is jebaiting me into buying a game because it said Metroidvania and that when I looked at the art in the store page I actually thought it would be good, but once you actually start to experience this game it starts to become Afro Samurai 2 Revenge of Kuma all over again without a license to even sell it accept for trying to capitalize off of the Metroidvania genre. Last Dead Cells if half a game and still twice as good as this game and polished."

As stated at the time of this review the team has stated the game is in a pllayablle but very rough state. A number of the boss fights are broken. I had to skip the first and go onto the second and when I defeated said boss the game would not allow me to exit the area so that encounter is indeed also broken massively. Do NOT get me wrong, I enjoy this game very much but I have done all there is so far in the game that it will allow me to do so at this point I actually cannot progress in the game any further. Another thing I'd like to mention concerning bugs and such is that a save point near the Monastary is funky. When you enter it you can save however when you exit the save room it teleports you to the screen BELOW instead of outside. It's apparent that the game needs to be patched and I'm sure devs are aware of this. Sadly until then there's not much I can do with the game. It's incredibly promising and is gorgeous! So please don't let these issues go unfixed. This is a game that when fully polished I expect myself to 100% and possible go through more than once, cheers."

The game takes place thus far in a dark medieval fantasy setting akin to Castlevania or Dark Souls, with a variety of enemies from hulking monstrosities to creeping little skulls taking place in a variety of locations including underground tunnels and decrepit monasteries.The game's biggest problem that turned me off initially while playing (I'm using an Xbox One USB controller) is that the platforming feels somewhat imprecise and a bit like your character's speed builds momentum too fast, it feels a bit like you have to press jump a couple steps before you're about to reach the end of some of the game's smaller platforms. I'm more used to it now but it took a fair amount of getting used to.  The combat as well seems to resemble more of a mash fest versus certain enemies but there is precise timing involved as well. You have a back and forward dash with LB and RB and you also pick up a shield which can block damage.What is there can range in feeling from a mash fest DPS race versus certain enemies (with your default abilities, anyway...) to precise dodges required to defeat bosses. I haven't unlocked a double-jump yet, or another item to unlock something on the ground, so more player abilities will probably add to the player's feeling of mobility and fluidity that may be lacking in the early sections of the game. You can tell early on while exploring the levels whether it be a platform ~just~ out of reach or a strange looking wall that you'll be retreading areas (for better of for worse, I don't mind) with new abilities to unlock the next part of the story once you can ""use the mist.""Speaking of the story, it seems very minimal at this point, which I don't mind ambiguity in a game's storyline, but you're pretty much just thrown in to explore without much incentive beyond seeing the new areas and enemies. The game graphically looks great and runs fine, with well-done pixel art for your main character, bosses, enemies, and attacks. The levels have a good variety of where they take place -I just arrived to a Monastery section- but how they take place on some of the platforming sequences do feel a bit uninspired/limited (i.e. I have to jump to how many of these moss platforms before I see something new in the background?) that being said, I imagine a variety of traversal options will speed the pace up quite a bit (double-jump, etc...) The music and sound effects are all really well-done as well.It's a really good game overall, but its at times imprecise-feeling platforming controls and at times ""frantic"" feeling combat versus certain enemies can be annoying."

,Not Recommended,525380,34236151,Posted: 14 August,all,malaisling,"Not a playable game if you have motion sickness. The character moves so fast, is expected to change platforms so often, and the camera has no smoothing and directly moves with the character; it's very sickening. There are also various enemy attacks and the players own heavy attack which shake the screen; and there is no toggle option to turn it off.Beyond this, although the graphics and animations are very nice; the combat itself is very spam based and badly structured. Player attacks do not stun or disrupt enemies and most of them have a decent amount of health and a moderate attack speed. Thus combat basically becomes a damage race of spam, the only way to really avoid it is by rapidly mashing the dodge button while trying to keep hitting the enemy. Which not only is awkward and inelegant, but is also impossible on smaller platforms. They could have made is so enemies have low health and thus die quickly, or made it so the players attack stun enemies; they did neither and the combat feels very unrefined because of it.The environments aren't very impressive either, they really just are not shaped or designed in a way that makes them feel remotely immersive, real or in theme to the world. It just looks like the developers made a couple primitve ground and wall textures and then pasted them onto various pieces of geometry with a paltry amount of actual objects and decoration thrown in.The fact that the game was essentially broken at launch and the developers barely patched it before abandoning it and trying to phrase it in a way that didn't make them sound like scum, also doesn't help.Game may be worth the price for players really into this genre but as a general concept the game is not of a good quality."

Unfortunately, there were too many issues to consider this a game worth purchasing.The controls aren't tight, and I often had trouble making basic jumps I can easily make in other games.Enemies are far too aggressive at the beginning of the game. There's one enemy that constantly chases you and lunges after you; I didn't even bother fighting it and just jumped over it or ran away. It's the beginning of the game, where players are just getting used to the controls and mechanics. They shouldn't be thrown in to the deep end that quickly.The shield feels like it's supposed to combat the archer enemies, but it doesn't really do much to succeed in this. The dash feels pretty restricted as well.The music felt unfitting to the game world.Overall, I can not recommend this game in its current state. I hope that the developers take these criticisms into account to offer a higher quality experience in the future. I don't want to give up on Demon Peak, but I simply can't enjoy it as it currently is.EDIT: I just want to make it clear, I'm open to changing this review entirely as the game is updated. I'll be following the game closely and noting what's improved with each patch, major or minor. The game will probably never fully suit my preferences, but that's not important. The most important metric in whether I recommend any game or not is if it's fun. If I can one day play Demon Peak and have a truly fun experience, perfect or not, I would be just as delighted to recommend it to others as I would be to play it myself."

My review is still largely the same.PROS:Takes from Asian religions and culture and uses it very well, especially with how you're ""guarded"" by a giant cat beast/demon. I can't get over the kittens and their little milk bowls either, as well as going out of their way to identify the iconic Oni masks the samurai were so fond of, among other things.Combat is good and well balanced, every time you get killed doesn't make you frustrated, rather it reminds you that you should've either saved or played differently.Bosses are not the only thing that are entertaning, the level design is good and fun to fight the monsters in, as per my gripes with the Momodora series but that's for another day.Fantastic Soundtrack.CONS:If you don't like pixelly graphics this isn't for you. Personally I don't mind them.Sound design is a bit lackluster. Some things sounded like they were recorded in someone's bedroom.Some enemies are awkward to learn and nothing will properly tutorialize you on this (this could also be a pro depending on the person).While the music is great some of it doesn't go well with the areas.
