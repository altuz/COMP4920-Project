The English in the tutorial text/component descriptions are especially distracting and confusing at times, which isnot goodin a game that is trying to teach you the fundamentals of digital logic. Additionally, certain actions (in my case, removing wires) take an unusually long amount of time to perform. It's a shame, too, because the information it teaches is real, accurate, and quite valuable.This is not to say that it doesn't work at all; it does. It's just quite clunky and awkward in its execution at the moment. The issues I have with the game can be easily fixed (cleaning up the text, and working on some minor hitches); it's just a matter of what the next few patches look like.Hardware Engineering has the potential to be great, and at $5, it would be a steal if it were a bit more polished, but unfortunately I cannot recommend it as-is at the date of review (September 29th)."

It's also not much of a game, really an exam in engineering.Personally I think a few optimisations would be nice to make this more fun and engaging.1. Too much language in the initial instance and poorly written.2. Interface is clunky.  Click to select, click to drop, MMB for selecting wire points which don't snap properly.  Then moving parts around the board don't keep the wires attached.  There is huge room for improvement here - though it is a good start as it does looks nice.3. Design language.  Perhaps there's a reason I'm missing but why not use the same image for a NOR chip in the inventory as on the board?4. Game.  Ok, this feels much more like an exam than a puzzle game (though I appreciate this in a way).  However, it is a sudden and sharp learning curve for anyone who is new to the subject.  Consider making the tutorial a series of levels instead of a tutorial with far more problems to solve in a far longer learning curve.I like this game, but you do need time and plenty of it - no criticism there.  But time spent in a game is usually to enjoy it rather than fight an interface and reach your ability limit before finishing even the tutorial.  Though to be fair I am a bit stupid..."

If you own the TTL or CMOS cookbook you already have the schematics.  This would have been your perfect learning tool at the time.If you are expecting unicorns and wizards then this is NOT for you.If you are older than the first mobile phones you will know that moving a component on a breadboard doesn't move the wires.  This is NOT VISIO and nor should it be.  This is as close as it gets to creating REAL working circuits on a breadboard (without the actual breadboard or power supply).I am extremely impressed but I'm a 70's electronics nerd so you can expect me to be biased.This is NOT for everyone and it's not a ""gamers"" game and for those who get stuck, when you run the circuit, examine the logic in the step you are up to.  It is not really that hard to figure out from the truth tables.It would be nice to be able to ""splice"" wires anywhere and at the moment the wire crossovers can get a bit confusing.One important thing to note, you can create an actual circuit instead of using the predifined components and it will still rate you as successful.  A fantastic learning tool.  (See my full adder example in the artwork area).I just wish they would speed up the delete.  It is a REAL problem.BTW to change wires click 'w' then use the left mouse button.  It took me ages to find that out today after they changed it overnight."

Neglected by devs for a while, leading to users complaints about game unplayable...BUTHopefully, an easy turnaround exists - sending an ingame bug report - that unlocks the game progression.Now about gameplay.This puzzle-educational game holds its originality in the way it teaches a pretty tough subject in a non-usual academic manner.Decades ago... I studied hardware engineering. I've been attracted by the fun challenge here, and the souvenirs of the past, as I never applied this knowledge during my career.The progression in levels is captivating, through incremental pedagogic steps, and it introduces gradually more and more complex concepts.Tutorials have yourself create and experiment applied designs, while the on-board simulator brings an in depth understanding of the logics going into the wires and chipsOf course, there's still work to be done by the devs - user interface is a bit rustic at the moment - but this Alpha stage game (devs status) is already pleasant to use, so hopefully, it should get even better in the futureThe in-game bug report is also a good idea for feedback.Eventually, I can say I'm getting good time and fun with this puzzle-educational game, and that's IMHO the most important.Really worth a try if you like this kind of games"

I woke up early to play it before class for a while and I already feel pretty mentally drained before heading out the door. That being said, I had fun and I will continue to play it for fun and education, as I think this is potentially a valuable learning resource.In regards to the allegations by other users about the text being distracting or confusing, I can't agree with them. It's written better than most textbooks I've had to deal with on similar subject matters, and I appreciate the snippets of personality that were injected throughout.There are a few bugs, and its a bit tiring changing around the circuits, but overall I can tell that this has already been pretty polished.

Compared to a few other offerings out there on itch and iOS, this is definitely a more thorough learning tool.While the UI has its quirks, my main complaint is the lack of instruction on how to create wires, in addition to the 'online online' aspect of this game.

If you're into circuit engineering, you're probably going to find something to learn and challenges to complete.The reason I cannot recommend this title is because the developer is failing to provide working online servers while simultaneously being cocky about this game requiring online connectivity on the forums, using language like (paraphrasing) ""I'd like to remind you that unlike you I've seen the code for this game"" to another user asking for help.Since there's no logical reason for this game to require online connectivity, this is a huge no for me. This would be the perfect game to take on a train or plane where a few hours can be wasted away, but nope.EDIT: Since this isn't apparently obvious to everyone, the negative portion of the review has to do with the online requirement and nothing to do with the developer's arrogant attitude. It's a good game when it works."

More Lemmings,"Right off the bat: The game is lacking a lot of polish, menus are slow and oftentimes frustrating, I've encountered bugs where changes I make to assembly code don't stick (I always end up having to test twice before my changes go through, but occasionally that's not enough), the instructions aren't always clear and everything is online, so if their servers go down you can't play at all.If any of that is a dealbreaker (which would be totally fair), this game isn't for you.If you can look past that stuff, it's a lot of fun to work with circuits and microprocessors at a lower level than most programming games let you.

I'm an engineering student, and it's entertaining / challenging to go over topics that I have covered in class. This is a great tool to learn logic design.However, the interface needs a lot of work. Deleting things takes a long time, and I've had a few tests get stuck in an infinite loop in which I had to stop the test and start over.I'm also not a huge fan of the testing protocol. Our computers are good enough to simulate every case in 10-20 cycles (Most people's computers run at let's say 3+ GHz, so literally microseconds.) yet it takes full seconds to delete wires and run tests. Not only that, but it's unclear what end case it's supposed to be. It tells you which output is wrong, but you have to go back and figure out what that output's going to be.And don't get me started on their backward truth tables that follow no rhyme or reason! Usually a truth table goes from 0 0 0 0 to 1 1 1 1, not jumps around with no logic.I am hopeful the developers will continue to tweak the interface and improve the game. As of now, I have to say it's definitely a mixed bag of nuts that requires a lot of patience.I do not recommend it in it's current state, however it has a huge potential for improvement."

I see a lot of people are complaining about having to use the middle mouse button for wires but if you press W you toggle the wire tool so that's not an issue. The biggest issue I have is that when you move a component the wires don't move with it, you have to re-arrange them manually.Positives-This game is truly one of a kind. It's very rare to find a game that is both equally educational and satisfying to this extent.-It provides not only tutorials but design (puzzle) and sandbox levels which would allow you create your own components, processors etc and then compile them into modules which you can reuse on larger scales. It's extensible.Rounding OffThe developers are already ironing out any issues and improving on the controls.The game itself does have a steep learning curve but there's no better feeling than understanding and overcoming it.If you enjoy topics relating to logic gates and electronic engineering and have some basic understanding on how binary operates (this is coming from a programmer) then I urge you to try this game out."

There's no connection problems on my end for sure, and still I will often have to discard my designs cause I can't even save them without connection. I can take pictures of the components, but I will still have to rethink the wiring and other stuff.There's also some other inconveniences in the usability, but most of them I expect to be ironed out in the future.

Developers are pretty quick to respond! High hopes for this game.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Game can be very good for the right type of person, but it is quite a buggy mess at this point.What's broken:1) Deleting wires is messy right now, each wire section must be clicked on separately to delete, also deleting is rather... laggy.2) Full 1-bit adders do not work. For some reason the carry-out does not actually signal anything. Don't believe me? 4th screenshot shows a black wire on the carry-out line for the full adder, when running a circuit simulation a black wire is one that is not carrying any signal. This does make getting a good rank on one of the levels impossible.3) When in wire laying mode, selecting a new component to place will change your cursor, but the behavior is a bit... strange... you have to click drag to place the part, and then place a wire at the same time, and there's no indication it's because you're in wiring mode, so you'll click around for a bit wondering what the heck is going on.4) Typos... but meh, not game breaking.Quality of life issues:1) Honestly only one that I've encountered so far, and that's the wires do not follow the component around, so moving a component means deleting and redoing the wires. Combined with the really buggy and laggy wire deletion scheme means sometimes you'll start a level over just to avoid having to delete wires.The good:1) Learn about circuits!2) Challenging, for someone who's not an electrical engineer, this actually teaches the basics pretty well. Learn by doing is great.3) Presents components in bite sized chunks, never really throws too much at you, but a bit more explanation could help.Overall, this game is not in a very user friendly state. I still find it fun, but I'm one of those people who don't mind some hassle if it means I learn something interesting.

I really don't find the controls unintuitive like others and enjoy the simplicity.Hit W to swap between drag/dropping things and placing wires, G to pull up the grid so you can let your OCD take over, which trust me, you'll want that♥♥♥♥♥♥It starts off incredibly simple and becomes more complex over time with each level requiring you to expand on the knowledge you've gained from the previous levels. This is a wonderful approach because it makes sure that your new found skills actually stick with you and you don't forget them. Sometimes there are grammatical errors but those can for the most part be easily ignored. I still don't understand some things when explained in words because of all the technical terms for concepts but that's okay, because getting the hands on experience, seeing what's going on with the logic gates and building the circuits then running the test should give you a far better idea of what's going on. Plus those truth tables are a godsend. Sure it only has digital logic but that's not necessarily a bad thing, especially if you have no experience with this kind of thing as it will probably seem overwhelming enough as is. You can do a lot with digital logic anyways.This had a really buggy release a couple days ago and could even still be buggy for some people today but fortunately it seems stable on my end. The developer responded to me immediately as well as many others with assurance that they're fixing the game up as fast as they can and so far has delivered a patch and several hotfixes that have fixed all of my problems. They were also curteous, which is always nice.I'd recommend this game to: Engineers, anyone interested in how computers work, anyone who really really likes puzzles, and pretty much any fan of Zachtronics games. It might not have all the polish in the world but seeing as it now works properly for me and I can actually play the game, it is an incredibly wonderful, fun, and most of all SATISFYING (when you finally succeed) experience that I can safely say is worth the ~$5 I spent on it. I hope this game gets both the attention, and optimization (bug fixes for everyone) that it deserves/needs."

Game is server-sideonly, yet devs report frequent issues with connectivity making it nonfunctional (of course, devs blame it on users. It is NOT on my end however).While I would normally put up with these in an early access game, the devs inability to accept that issues exist and their general arrogance leads me to believe this game will not be going anywhere good.

With no options menu. No idea what happens if you have a non-16:9 aspect ratio since it appears you can't change that or the resolution. There's a button that says 'basic' that does nothing when clicked, and other than that, I only clicked the tutorial button.When I opened the tutorial, a small box with a few messages from what I think is another 'engineer' in the game popped up. I couldn't scroll down the menu to read them all. There might not've been more, but the final message was cut off at the bottom, so that's a problem.So, the tutorial itself. Your goal is to do a 'logical multiplication on the inputs' which, apparently, just means using an AND gate on the inputs. Seems confusingly worded, but maybe that's a real term, I have no idea. So, the input components menu let you put in a constant input of high or low, or the two inputs the game was actually trying to get you to use. Unfortunately, both of the inputs you are supposed to use look EXACTLY the same, which could get confusing later.I never got to that 'later' to see if it ever got confusing because the tutorial is impossible to pass. After getting through the confusing wiring mechanic where, instead of just dragging the little nodes on the components to the input of another component, you have to draw wires between them manually by hitting 'W', I ran a simulation.For some reason, instead of just testing every possible input to make sure it works, you have to hit 'continue' after every input test. Whatever, minor inconvienence. Well. On the 3rd or 4th test, the simulation window said something along the lines of ""ERROR: Unable to parson JSON input on"". It just cut off at 'on'. I replaced and rewired the entire circuit, thinking maybe I had used 2 of the same inputs (I hadn't, I had seen different inputs when running the simulation, but whatever) and then it started giving me the error at the first test. Every time. Nothing fixed it. I gave up and refunded it.TL;DR - The game has no options menu to change resolution, aspect ratio, or to mute the music. Some of the components look exactly the same, which could make things confusing later. The tutorial is impossible to pass."

It would have been better off to release this as a beta build outside of steam.The UI needs serious work. Symbols for components are different from the parts list when you place them. The english can be confusing to people (Especially if you have no experience with logic) with how it explains things. Wiring can be annoying and for some people has been a bit buggy with things not connecting and reloading saves destroying connections.Also this game is based on a external server. So you need a internet connection to play and it can be affected by latency. There seems to be lag when placing components but removing a wired connection can take multiple seconds. Load times while not super long seem much longer then what they should be considering little graphical effects and it is not constantly running simulations.Overall the concept is great and it could be a really fun game but it is held back by bugs, poor UI design and irritating performance. Still on my wishlist but im getting a refund for now."

According to the dev the issues were fixed but I have yet to retry everything again due to having some problems with my card transaction on Steam so it's not currently allowing me to repurchase the game.I will, however, be changing the review to a THUMBS UP for the reason that the developers are listening to the community and still fixing the game and also because it's a DAMN GOOD CONDEPT of a game. It would be great to see more 'Engineering' games coming form the studio.Having said that if you haven't read the other reviews then still be aware that it is an Online only game.I'm not an expert but I think the game is suffering from whatever engine it's running on. There was a problem with performance especially deleting wires and there is an option for playing it on a browser. Again, not an expert but if the game is natively running on browser with a windows 'wrapper' then that might be the reason it can't be optimized properly. If the game performance itself would be fixed then this would be the perfect game of its kind, or maybe the only one.----------------------------------  OLD REVIEW -----------------Wonderful concept - instant purchase. Doing the second tutorial but it's ""stuck"" in simulation. Pretty sure the circuit is correct but I'm not sure if it's still doing it or it's stuck since there's no indication on what part of the simulation it currenty is on.EDIT:Btw, just a note for anyone wondering since the gamelay is node-based, connections don't stick to the nodes so if you move a node to another place the wiring still is left for you to reconnect/remove.EDIT2:For anyone wondering about the 'bug'. According to the forums all you need to do is connect branching wires from the source itself not from any part of the wire. It's counter intuitive but it will get you going. Also consider that the optimization is currently very bad. Deleting wires take several seconds as experienced by other users from the discussions as well.I'm optimistic everything will get fixed and will update the reveiew if ever it gets done."
