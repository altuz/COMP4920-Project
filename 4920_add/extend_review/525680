76561198036493677,Recommended,525680,32282526,Posted: 8 June,all,Cullinarn,"This is, quite simply, the only VR ""god"" game worthy of the legacy of Populous. It is a delightful little sandbox where you craft a living, breathing, world. Within this world you get to interact with your people through the use of spells, or your mighty, aethereal hands. Your civilizations grow, each according to the environment which surrounds them. And the save game feature ensures that you can jump into your little world to relax for an experience which can be downright cathartic after a rough day. I ahve played Super Island God, and was unimpressed. I play Tethered, and while I love it, it is not a pure ""god"" game. Deisim is the only viable choice in the genre right now.One caveat: The game is still in development, and consequently the spells and civilizations are somewhat limited. Yet though the game is far from finished, it is virtually bug-free, and the single dev working on it posts frequent updates. To put it simply, he has a devotion to the genre that promises a journey into wonderful things to come. This game, and this game alone, is the one reason why I, who had been an Oculus-Home-only guy since I got the Rift last year, downloaded SteamVR. And Deisim, my friends, did NOT disappoint. I cannot recommend it highly enough, and I cannot wait to see what the developer, Myron, has in store for the future."

But then they stopped believing.Heretics dismissed my existance and persuaded the mortals into believing I was no longer real.They had no faith.They did not believe in me...I needed to make them believe...At first I attempted to crush the problem at it's source, destroying the heretics I could find.  But it wasn't enough... They still didn't believe... How could I force them to believe?Lacking in the raw power of faith I needed to give my miracles I resorted to the only option I had left: Fear.I lifted their homes from their foundations and slammed them back down onto those who rejected me. Each and every town who lost faith in me suffered my wrath. Once I regained enough of my power I set fire to the rest who refused to fall in line.They now believe again.They will not forget again."

I did have the game lock up once, but didn't look into the cause if it my system or not.As this review is of an early access title, I am very eager to follow how this game develops - Developer actively solicits feedback and implements good ideas from the players.  Deisim is well worth the low price of admission."

Even so early in it's development it's very satisfying to get a few tiles down, sit on the floor and watch the world go by. Then get carried away and melt the place with volcanos. I think once a few more features are implemented this game will be far too easy to sink an entire night in to and wonder where the time went.There's something very very satisfying about the aesthetic as well. While the graphics aren't photorealistic, it's very nice to look at. Though personally, I think a game like this doesn't need to be 'beautiful' to be amazing.  I think more variants of the objects wouldn't be such a bad idea, but hey, early access.A VR god game like this is something I've been dreaming of for the Vive since purchasing it, and I think this title (Even on day ONE of early access) has the potential to fill that very large void. But only if development continues and passion doesn't fade. ;)"

,Recommended,525680,31011756,Posted: 8 April,all,The Big Bad Wolf,"I love Deism.This is Populous in VR, essentially. It's early days yet as I write this review, but I love the management and building aspects of this one. Even as simplistic as it is at the moment, it provides hours of enjoyment. The developer seems active, and appears to be actively updating the game with more content.What it is: Deism is a god-sim where you stand on (or in) a world you create and help your humans evolve and thrive. It's a bit of a juggling act to keep everyone happy and healthy as your world grows and heretics start to challenge your authority.Caveat: Deism is in early access. You can play and make achievements, but there are only three types of societies right now (desert, grassland, and tundra). Those societies only advance through three ages each. That said, it's clear that the dev is putting a lot of thought into the game and even as bare-bones as it is right now, it's a ton of fun.Pick up Deism while it's still cheap. It's worth your time if you love god-sims."

Sadly, after the game gets to about mid-point, it cannot handle the processing of additonal humans or towns.  Or, if you build beyond a few plots out, it cannot process the game and you lose visual contact on the Vive.  My Nvidia 1080 Founders showed a mere 25% use of the GPU, and my equipment is otherwise high-end.  Coding needs to be tightened to make the game playable for more than a few minutes.  Great concept, great starting point, now make it playable, please."

I will spend hours just buidling up a world, then starting over, making it a little better. It is fund taking out the heritics different ways. Drop in a volcano, drop from the sky, throwing into a mountain and the fun to watch, launch into space. The little buggers deserve no mercy! It is fun to watch the land you design get built upon.Its been fun to watch and play the improvement the dev has made. You will not be disappointed, money well spent."
,Recommended,525680,34163359,Posted: 11 August,all,Nemeth782,"So far it's the core of a really interesting game. In the vein of Black and White, or Populus, but VR really makes it. It's a single man developer but he's doing really well and is really dedicated - the game is obviously his baby and it shows.There are a couple of small issues, such as the menus appearing in a weird place and having to move around a lot - I bumped into more furniture playing this than I have in a while - but all the bugs are manageable and it's not like you're running around.It's a sandbox, there isn't much yet in terms of structure or objectives, but it's the core of an awesome game. I'm really excited to watch how it develops."

Yes the map may look simple with squares, but in all honesty i as a non creative  programmer think it is great to just throw a map tile here and there instead of carefully painting the terrain. It also makes it simpler for the developer to expand the game with more advanced features quicker."
,Recommended,525680,29531871,Posted: 27 January,all,Groundhog,"A strangely satisfying experience watching your little mortals toil, settle new colonies, and yes, even spread heresey (before being hurled off into space or into a volcano, at least) as I toss earth tiles all over my little universe.Yeah, there's not a lot to do right now outside of checking for heretics and laying down titles, but the foundation has been laid for a great game. I'm glad to have dropped some coin for it if it helps the dev work towards adding more content.In the future I'd love to see beasts of burden working the farm land, overland vehicles (horse & carriage), clashes between different settlements, and of course more ways to interract with our loyal and disloyal subjects."

76561198044434264,Recommended,525680,33513358,Posted: 13 July,all,darklord413,"To start, I'd like to say that I may be a little biased towards this game, as I've enjoyed God-games since I was a child (note: not a sociopath). To see a game mix that love with my love for virtual reality was nothing short of incredible. When I first played this game I sat down in my chair and just enjoyed the atmosphere for awhile before even diving in.----PROS----- This game could stand on its own, in my opinion, even without the ""God"" abilities like lightning and plagues. I enjoy spectating in VR, and it was tons of fun to watch civilizations grow and expand into the lands that I created.- The abilities feel very balanced and are enjoyable to use.- For most of the things I wanted to do, I could do them. If I wanted to pick someone up and crush them, I could. If I wanted to pick up a house and throw it, I could.- Price. Very well-priced game for everything currently included.- Fun. Overall, this is an incredibly enjoyable game.----CONS----(Please note that this is an early access game, and these cons are not necessarily things that I didn't enjoy, but things that I would like to see improved)- Limited number of abilities, but still a fair amount to enjoy- Hope to see more interactivity in the future- Graphics, but I have to say that for a solo developer (I believe it's a solo developer), they actually look quite good. The gameplay is the primary aspect I was after, and the simple graphics have a calming presence about them- Hope to see more of a story/goals to accomplish in the future.----NOTES----I will update this review as more updates continue to roll out. If you're a fun of relaxing games that give you a chance to spectate an environment and influence a civilization, then this is the game for you. Get in on it now and reap the benefits of future updates."

It's an interesting concept, and I'd very much like to see this game take shape with missions, objectives, rival gods, etc.  It is quite relaxing to just sit and watch your people do their thing."
,Recommended,525680,29546006,Posted: 28 January,all,Noble Brutus,"Written in early access 28/01/17.A very bold game which has been pulled off very well so far. Think what 'Godus' should have been. It takes advantage of VR roomscale extremely well with most interactions being intuitive and fun.I was pleasantly surprised to find the humans settling different islands I'd built and was shocked to return and find they'd become heretics! Disobeying my rule of law and worshipping idol gods! Immediately I crouched down, found a heretic priest then flung him as far as I could off of the edge of the world. I proceeded to quarantine the city, disposing of any citizens who strayed towards the faithful. I grabbed some priests and dropped them there, sometime later the city eventually found the true way once more.Earlier I saved and left the game running while I answered a skype call, when I returned heresy had spread throughout almost all the world and left me without any mana-power left!Shaping up to be some great old-testament style fun!Features request:More city evolutions!Dropping priests in heretic/neutral cities to try and convert them back..Volcanoes should spread to more tiles (in my opinion). UPDATE : Dev added thisDemand sacrifice or tribute! And get more mana for doing so, but increases chance of heresy.Ability to place a 'prophet' and use them to instruct a city to do something e.g. crusade, build great temple, build ark, move to the promised land of your choosing or if a heretic city give them the chance to convert else send plagues etc.Keep it up! Love the game so far.- Update 06/03/17A number of recent updates have really improved the gameplay of Deisim, every time I've come back to it it's a little bigger and a little better. New miracles are cool - accidently burned down an innocent city of faithful citizens... oops. Sent plagues of locusts against heretics and watched them run in fear as I struck down their heretic priests with lightning. New viewing options allow you to view the world as if it were a tiny game of miniatures which I quite liked.I'd still like to see more tweaking and expanding to city evolutions, probably incorporating some more strategy. Not really sure what I'm after yet but allowing non-grassland cities to have more buildings and take over more tiles would be an obvious addition. Those giant igloos should maybe consider getting replaced ;)A really cool intuitive feature that might be difficult to implement would be grabbing and shaking the world to cause earthquakes and watching as all the little people fall over."

But the dev is very active in the community and does a lot of updates, as far as I have seen. Although this EA title is full playable and I found no bugs till now (other than many full titles in VR). And positive: it's an fair early acces prize (in comparison to other EA titles where you gotta pay the full prize for no updates).So:You get a great god game. You can waste tons of time without realizing. Thumbs up! And there's so much potetial in this one. Looking forward how this grows. Game is relaxing fun.Appreciate to the dev, stay tunded..."

Never played a ""god"" game before, but have always wanted to try one.At first it seemed really simplistic and I didn't think it would be very interesting for very long.  Then as you build more, the civilizations progress, and you really start to unravel the depth of this game.  I am really quite impressed.You can build massive worlds, get several villages of all different types and variety.  You can do nice things, and mean things.  And the game keeps you moving more and more as you grow your world, and the depth really shines.Above all else, the dev is very active, responds in the discussion frequently.  I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in trying a ""god"" game.  It's a lot of fun, and easily worth the price point."
,Recommended,525680,28834501,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,¡Splendid!,"Very new as of this writing but plenty entertaining to sit down and watch your little people grow and do things. So far a pretty chill game with no real ending, but the Dev is very receptive and active on the forums towards ideas on where to take the game.I got the game in anticipation of great things and to support a small dev. I've played a lot of Spore and Tropico and that type of thing, so seeing little people you control or creations of yours is fun. Modeling so far is good, but few options overall apart from kinda just watching. As of now too there is a certain order of things and you have to figure out what type of land is required to get them to evolve to the next stage of civilization. If you can't do that, the game seems very slow going, which can be boring for now, but again I think there are fun things planned in the future. If you want a finished polished game this isn't it (yet), but I really liked how involved the Dev was in the creation of the game, so we will see where it goes after the next couple of big updates and the meat of the game starts to form.Edit to add, I've heard a bit about bad performance in this game, but as of 1/1/17 playing for an hour I had ten sites and maybe 150-200 people (a counter stat would help) and didn't notice any performance problems. Might've been a split second blank screen once or twice but compared to other demos I've tried I just figure on stuff like that with new technology. Nothing game breaking by any means. I'm on a 1070, i5, 16gb ram, and using 1.4 supersampling."

As the world grows and expands people will create new societies. Heretics will pop up and begin trying to turn your people against you, promoting the worship of false gods. Obviously this won't do, so you must smite these heretics with fire and lightning, set locusts upon their crops or just pick them up and cast them to the ground in a grand display of divine force. Either way, they won't be unfaithful for much longer. You can also reward those faithful to you through miracles of rain and regrowth. Whether you're a loving and caring god, or a brutal and demanding one is entirely up to you.Even as it is now Deisim is a lot of fun to hop into and mess around with. New updates and patches come out fairly frequently so if there's ever an issue with the game you can be sure the developer is going to address it as soon as he has time."

76561197980804400,Recommended,525680,34243547,Posted: 14 August,all,Tantalus,"This is pretty much what you see in the video - you are a god.  You use mana to create miracles, which can create new terrain tiles, cause weather or destruction.  Your mana comes from your worshippers - the more people you have, the more mana you get.  In order to get more people, you have to first make sure your existing people have access to resources like food, wood, and stone, then start creating new tiles at the border of your world.  Eventually, your worshippers will decide that a new settlement can be built, and some of your worshippers will move there and start a new village/city.If you ignore your worshippers for too long, though, heretics will begin to appear, and they will try to convert your worshippers to heresy, so you have to deal with the heretics (in the current official release, all you can do to deal with them is kill them, but in the beta, you can convert them).  Right now this happens too often in late game (by the time you have access to most of your miracles), but the dev is aware of the issue and is looking into it.The most appealing part to me is that there doesn't seem to be an end to this game.  Sure, there is a limit to the content - cities will only technologically advance to stone/medieval age, everybody fights with sword and shield, and nobody ever develops new clothes, but you seem to be able to expand your world's borders infinitely.  If there's a limit to how big you can make your world, I haven't found it yet.  Huge forests, Vast mountain ranges, glacial ice fields, sweeping deserts, wide open prairies - you can build all of it in whatever shape you choose by throwing (or dropping) the appropriate type of tile miracle on a blank tile.  My only nitpick here is that there doesn't seem to be a way to quickly overwrite a single tile if you make a mistake.Overall, if you like creating things, you can easily and quickly lose hours in this game.  I've owned it for less than 12 hours at the time of this writing, and have already spent 3.5 hours in it.  That's rare for a VR game, where most only last 15-30 minutes.  I personally can't wait to see where it goes!"

A bit extreme, but you need to keep your herd in line here.I'm using Oculus Rift and had the flickering issue that have been plaguing us for a while, I contacted the devs and they came up with a solution for that. Expect it to be fixed in the next update. I really appreciate devs that are approachable like that (and care about Oculus, even if we're losing the marketshare battle).This game is definitely worth it's price, and will only get better as time passes."

,Recommended,525680,29031482,Posted: 5 January,all,blerb,"This game has a ton of potential whether it be new tiles, new races, or in-game events. One of the game's biggest leading feature is the satisfaction of watching your villagers grow and your world expand nearly infinitely. Even with the disappointing lack of a save feature and the state of early access it's in, once the updates roll in you'll be grateful you got it for a cheaper price at early access, this game kept me just watching my villagers grow in numbers for half an hour. The only major improvement required is in the graphics department."

Deisim being basically the work of one guy, it's pretty impressive to get the chance to enjoy the gameplay offered for such a new game.The developer is very active in the community and constantly request feedback for improvements. The best part is that he does pay attention to requested feedback and within a short timeframe, you might get to play what you asked for. Very nice.Having been a dedicated player of Populous a long, long time ago, I really enjoy the God genre simulation. I feel like the developer has done a good job at providing that so far. Lots of potential and a fair price for what you get. Updates to the game are frequent and substantials. Can't wait to try the next update!!!"

Really chilled and un-pressured, watch the little peeps evolve and re-settle as you build an ever-growing environment for them.Dev seems really enthusiastic and in touch with players, so I think this is an early access game worth getting behind!"

,Recommended,525680,33505162,Posted: 13 July,all,Exyborg,"I'm a fan of the Civilization game series (884 hrs on V; 126 hrs on VI), and while Deisim is more about controlling humanity as a whole there are some comfortable feelings of reigning supreme that I felt were similar.Instead of exploring at the beginning, you build the landscape and everything else is left to chance. That and your willingness to see your humans grow and evolve. If the humans feel blessed, they emit faith which empowers you to build lands for them, sustain them, protect them and even destroy them. It's a truly great start to an awesome VR concept."

There are people who have faith in god(you), which are the good people, and you have heretics, the people who reduce the faith in god (you) and raid cities. The city evolution in this game is amazing, and one very nice detail is that mountains, rivers, and forests contribute to the development of cities and your civilization. You can throw fire balls, locust swarms, and lighting to punish heretics. This game is just amazing for its price, and I can't wait for the development of new features."

,Recommended,525680,34892202,Posted: 11 September,all,LEROY JENKINSSSSS,Amazing god game that isnt just a rts. Would reccomend for the price. I would like for there to be a option for putting mutable tiles at once because it takes forever to make a big ocean. Also can you make the swamp make mountions grass mountions inster of snow mountions. also make swamps that have trees.
,Recommended,525680,35354304,Posted: 30 September,all,CargoShortViking,"Overall, a great way to spend some time in VR. Is it a game? I don't think so, not in the tradiotional sense. There is no win/lose situation. But it is a great sandbox to play in, and I have really enjoyed my time here.  I haven't had the performance issues that others have described and it seems to run fine.  I want more tho.  Please add more things to do, events, variety. You get the idea. This is a great start but it could be so much more."
