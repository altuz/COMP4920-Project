I havent played MP yet, so that may work well.BUGS GALORE here: Dont believe me? Look at all the stickys on the first discussion page lol.Ive raced multiple races, multiple times in one season...? Imagine playing football manager, and after a game is finished, you play the same game a few weeks later...weird.At the end of the season, ive had to race another 9 times, even though there is none in my schedule. Yup...screwed me right over for my training!Ive had races where the riders go through fields, like with 10ft high grass, so you cannot even see their heads lol. Ive had them drive through houses, walls, trees etc.Ive had races where ive literally lost all control over my rider, and am left at the mercy of where the game thinks i should finish.There's loads more...Now what i will say is, if/when they eventually get it all fixed up, and balanced out..so the game doesnt differentiate player from AI, then there will be cracking games here. As it is, its an early access game for me. £30 quid..no way save your money. When its fixed then sure, there's loads of fun to be had here.I was kinda semi-addicted to this, mainly because, on the outside, it seemed to be a complex game. Underneath it feels all to shallow.I'll be continuing to play, and be pulling my hair out with this (since i payed £30 for it), and my review will surely change..when its fixed."

Scouting still sucks, contract renewals, financial management. So easy to imrove this game.Do not recommend if you have the 2016 or 15 edition"

It's fun when it works but so frustrating. Went in to the second year of my carreer and all of a sudden my rider has stopt resting, I tried cancelling all the races, they never show up on my schedule so i actually cancelled them. But even still my rider competes in the races.  Right now my rider is at 117% unrested and it goes up even when I cancell all training and races.♥♥♥♥♥♥game, i would be ashamed to put something so full of bugs on the market!"

For each improvement they make, they add a horrible element. Meanwhile, the same bugs since 2011 are still in this game. Why don't you skip a year and come to us with a finished game instead of a cashcow.Newest annoyances; blocking! You can't send a rider in the breakaway because it takes 35km to get to the front of the bunch (i counted). Can't make it to front on a mountain as well.Training system; it takes you 5 hours to set up your team at the start of the season. So you can't ask for a refund, I guess. Instead of 1 menu for training, you have to cycle through 4 or 5 screens per rider to set up the training programme in the most detailed way. Last year's system was fine, stop adding crap.EPO; the whole peloton is on EPO. It's not uncommon to finish an uphill stage with 30 riders, all sprinting"
76561198033596886,Recommended,525920,32793577,Posted: 25 June,all,MuchMucho,"Game is fun for those new to this genre, which I am.Cons:Though I dislike npc seeming to become better and have more stamina than what their ratings say,Ive tried to lose against a lvl 70 in mountain terrain when I had 82 I attacked set a pace of 75 which is very high uphill especially for a lvl 70 but nevertheless he caught up and won by over 2 min.......Damm that EPO.Other things I dislike is the way the npc block the entire road meaning if you have to gather water it will take you 10-15 km to get to the front, othertimes on hills this means even though you got 100 skill point as a mountain climber you will get stuck behind those in the 20ies placement since its in these whereabouts they use the entire road meaning they block you, and drag you down . Dumb and DUmb Ai where the Fairplay at which every cyclers is know for having they almost never take up all road there will almost alway be space for the fast people to get forward, due to the respect they have for one another.Graphics trucks in the middle of road, people in the middle of road, car is in the way, MC are in the way, spectaters halfed due to clipping through ground level.(default setting) Mouse curser will not work or work correct when upscaling, using 1600x900 full screen (there is a fix for this which I found out by playing with the options.ini file)Game doesnt use all cores, laggy, got problems with schedule yea game has way too many bugs.Im on the Fence of whether I should recommend this game, though it is very fun to play, and I hope they will fix all those nasty bugs, cus there are way too many of em.As game is now its a 51% for and 49% against meaning you could wait for a spell or 2, untill they have fixed all them bugs.Or you could live with the bugs for now knowing they will fix the bugs, if you cant live with a very buggy game then wait.If you can then this is recommended"

The really crap comentry i can put up with that but considering its a simulation you have very poor control over events ive been in races where ive tried dropping ppl on the last climb only to find riders who's stats are basic 60ish have kept up and then overtaken me my hills and mountain where 77/78 what did they have a RD condition of +20!!!!? it makes no sense at all. The other main gripe is the fact that you spend lots of time sorting ur season schedule and training to be at peak fitness for races and u get a totally random race day conition of minus 1-3  wtf...i have very rarely had a good RD condition the odd +2 so sort of makes the whole training a waste of time.As for getting into a breakaway forget it every time i try the pack runs me down yet they let everyone else who tries succeed most races im on max and still struggling to keep in the peleton absolutely stupid. There are many more stupid things about this game but i just cant be bothered to list them all, seems to be the way of Devs now release a game thats not really working as it should and then hit you with a hefty price tag for it probably cos they know we will still buy it...wake up and smell the coffee ppl they r taking us for a ride."
76561198397677655,Not Recommended,525920,34753850,Posted: 5 September,all,Mattitn,"Well, too much things go wrong. I've now spent enough hours on it to say with confidence: it's not my fault...Not working well:- ""press the space bar to stop simulation"". 7 days later, it finally stops. By now, contract offers are gone.- Be a pro: DO NOT BE A SPRINTER. It will make you go mad. The worst breakaways (5 guys wit 64 Ryding and no stamina on a flat stage of 160k) are impossible to catch with my entire team (Ryders of 65-74-) going after them. Meanwhile, other teams with better sprinters than me don't even seem interested in catching the breakaway. So the breakaway that got 4 mins max is not caught. If however, on occasion you do succeed to catch the breakaway, and get a good train on the road, in 1  out of 3 times, the leadoutguy just doesn't even begin his sprint when pressing ""S"". Het just let's go mid screen and you lose 20 positions straight away. In other times when it does work, your sprinter of 75 in the shape of his life gets beaten by a nitwit with 68 sprinting, when you let him explode at the 1k mark.. it's rediculous!- Guys like Peter Sagan just keep following climbers with 83 climbing on a 10k climb of 8%. Impossible to win mid mountain stages with a climber.- I only win climb stages with the best climber in freakish climb stages (with over 50k of climbing to do) by doing the final climb on my own pace, not following any attack, and in the end catching up with the nutty attackers being dead 3k's before the finish.- Ever done a breakway in a mountain stage? Every single one of the guys in the breakaway thinks he can win the polkadot jersey, and attacks on every single climb to get the points. So or you do the same and destroy your riders yellow bar, or you don't and you're left chasing the breakaway until the next climb, where they attack once again.- I could go on and on, but it never stops.Overall, there's too many things wrong with this game when it could be that much more fun. It gets frustrating.That can never be the intent of a game so I'm done.Edit: most errors occur in the Pro Cyclist mode. Career mode is playable, however sometimes the lead out guy doesn't want to start his sprint still happens."
76561197980684090,Not Recommended,525920,33609356,Posted: 17 July,all,Holme Kjeldsen,"Why would I not reccomend a game even with +40 hours on the record?I have owned PCM in several version, the first one before steam days (UBI soft i think), and the latest was PCM 2013 here on steam.  I read the reviews and didnt update my PCM in 2014,2015 & 2016 and I'm glad I didnt.This year, 4 year have past, and I thought that somethings have got to have improved, right?well...not really, and thats where it disappoints me. There isnt really that much new.All names are still fictional btw, probably due to some copyright issues.So if you want to update, just to get the latest names and jersey, thats not gonna help.You can do that via thirdparty DB regardless. Admitted  it's easier now through Steam Workshop.The UI are updated slightly every year. It might be nicer, but basicly it works the same.Track racing to me seems 100% the same as 4 years ago.Not only is the commentator ridicuolous , he's also excatly the same as 4 years ago.I have playes 40 hours, and havent heard even one new frase....Comon Cyanide? really? for €40,-?§!Graphics is also a huge dissapointment for me.I have a 980 with 8GB and runs everything maxed out. Theres no lag, but I have to run in a window cause my widescreen 21:9 monitor is not supported. (bummer, most decent game support that in 2017!).When running a stage, the graphics is flickering. Most visible textures flicker back and forth on jerseys, banners etc.Trees are flickering in different green variations constantly.Shadows are blurry and somethings really really Clunky. It's most visible on the telephone wires, which probably never would cast a shadow anyway, but the do, and on the ground they look like 3 foot wide wires....But the 3D rendering is the worst I think.- At the start of the race theres like 40 riders in the front row, and there's only room for 20. Resulting in arms and handlebars crossing in each other. btw It looks like theres only 2 different textures of hairy arms :)-Stupid spectators (looks like 10-15 year old graphics) bounce off and often through the ground (to their knees)- their flags are ""stiff"" and they moonwalk or skid in and off the road. Looks stupid.- Cars are on the street everywhere, sometimes facing directly against the direction the route is going. I found that flaw most in Criteriums (with several laps). And the cars didnt dissapoint :), it was there every single lap, all riders passing directly throuh it.- Cyclist are running through each other, and through cars, and through the red/white road barriers. And ohh through the road as well. Sometimes it looks like the sink 3-4 inches throuhg the ground, at other times they ""float"" above the ground.- Cyclist seem to run on a invsible ""rail"" running in the road. When they do change from side to side, the skid sideways left and right, in an akward unrealistic way.I  could go on listing the 3D flaws, but I think I made my point.This game is just an update of the stages, everything else feels old old old old old....I believe this is like the 15th. rendition of PCM?? or something close. It's just not op to 2017 standards!Comon Cyanide? really? for €40,-?§!If all the new staqes was DLC it might justify a €9,99 download, but as ""NEW"" game at full price, holy crap. And I'm even comparing to a 2013 rendition.I love Cycling, I love TDF, and on PC I really dont have an alternative.Thats the only reason I keep clocking hours on PCM 2017."

It's as if there was absolutely no QA done at all and I suspect that they had to release in time to get on the back of Tour de France coverage.I have had countless times where the game simply freezes and can't be retrieved and doesn't generate a crash report. The final straw though was playing Be A Pro, submitting a contract offer, clicking continue to progress the game and next time the simulation stops the acceptance period has come and gone. Are you serious? That's not even a bug, just bad engineering.The game itself can be fun, though it could be better. I'll probably try it again after future patches but for now it could be considered criminal to retail the game as a finished product at US$40."

Not only theres ore bugs, but the AI (especially for sprinters) has gotten so much worse and stupid, that its almost no fun at all to play flat or classics races. the realisme has totally gone sour!It seems to me, they every year rush a ""new"" game out with few changes in features. The sponsor side is ok, BUT now i have played two carrer modes and after few years, suddenly frame/wheel etc sponsors either dont give you offers (even though you make all or almost all of your goals) and if they do its so small amounts that you can not keep the team running because your financial situation will bancrupt you!other ingame bugs, well just look at all others who have written about wich bugs they have and then you get a real view of this game. those who are positive, well either they are bias or they have just played a VERY limited time.another major flaw for instance - my last carrer game, after a few season i suddenly after having choosen my riders for vuelta, they suddenly arent in the vuelta.... laeving me with nothing AGAIN... i could play the game 3d, but no action as i suddenly had NO riders in the game....Dont waste your money on CYANIDEs BUGGY S... game.... PRO cycling..... well there isnt much PRO about this game franchise, at least it hasnt been for years. Save your money unless if you can get it for less than 5 dollars.2017 is the last Pro cycling manager game EVER for me.... I lost ALL trust in CYANIDE to make an a least decent game... bugs there will always be, but again EVERY year its so bad and many, its totally takes out the joy of the game. the game could have been the best sports manager game ever, but somehow it gets screwed up every year :-(DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND HARD EARNED MONEY on this game"

This edition is by far the most complete version to be released, and amazingly, has not had any critical failures yet (I think back to last year, when I could not connect with a log in for the first week).The major changes are only those which have been advertised, so do not expect a wildly different game from last year. I recommend the game to any cycling fan, especially those that are a fan of the series. I'm sure there will be bugs the community will uncover, as always. But compared to some of the most popular early access games available on Steam, this game runs as good or better.Well done Cyanide. This is the most successful release you've had to date."

I reported this bug (UCI WC ITT) and two days ago there was the information you fund the bug and had a fix but you didn't relased him. WHY?  Now it's weekend that means another 2-3 day not playing atleast.If that's the way you will treaten your customers?I know Cyanid is a small studio and you didn't have the oportunities of a tripple A devoloper and thats fine but especial as a smaler dev you should even try to do the best game you can and if that's is your best i see a dark or may no future for you.So enough raged let's go to my resume until now.= pro cylingpositiv:- new stage challanges in pro cyclist (motivates me to play stages i normaly will simulate) good innovation makes the career more intersting should be continued in the future- personal target setting makes the game more realistic- requesting of domestic good idea unfortunaly i coudn't test how good it work due to the bugnegativ:- game breaking bugs- UCI WC (selecting to many drivers from the wrong country) not possible to countinue the game- UCI WC races are not shown in the shedule (at lest after you are nominated it should be show so you can plan with it)- driver in unasigned races (compleatly runins you training & fitness plan & maybe you season)- game crash 10/24 (should be fixed now)resume pro cyclist:a good step in the right direction but unfortunaly unplayable due to this game braking bugs.Bugs you normaly should figured out during your pre-release test if you did some.= team careerpositive:- follow me function (finaly we can do mountain trains)- domestic assining per target instead of full season (a first step in the right direction shoud be continued and optimized)negative:- still not possible to announce my own captains (i am the team manager i will decide how is a captain and how is a domestic)- why did you removed the oportunity of planing my drivers in the shedule (drag&drop) this realy helped to see wihich driver will be participated in which race and how many race days every one will have at the end of the season. So i can re-shedule domestics and maybe cancel or ad some races if i had not enogh fit drivers)=general thingspositive:- better loading times (still long but improved due to last year)- less gaming crashingnegative:- new black&white race bar in time trail has such a bad contrast its much harder to see how many track is left compared to energy (looks fency but makes the game worse)- still glitching bars and viewers on the track (looks ugly but by all the major bug are in this game a smaler problem)- planing a season specialy in team career needs hours before you can go to your first race. It's anoying and espacialy for new players nearly impossible to understand.general resume:If you already own 2016 or an older version don't buy untill all the major bugs are fixed and enjoy the your version (use a databank for 2017) and wait for a sale because this version is not worth the full price (unfortunally) it's more an DLC than a full price game.I realy hope Cyanid will fix all this bugs and make this game playable.I will revue this in some weeks if i see some major improvements till them my resume is don't buy.a realy disapointed ""fan"""

I do however, have a few areas of criticism.1. Sprint finishes are much worse than they have been in previous editions. The sprinters energy levels go down way too slowly. For example, in Milan-San Remo my sprinter can sprint for the entire 3km the game allows you to sprint. This is obviously ridiculous, as in reality a sprinter can only max out their sprint for around 200m. This means having a solid lead out train is pretty pointless. You just make sure your rider is at the front at 3km to go and then its near impossible to be beaten irrespective of your riders stats (provided they are a sprinter). I don't even bother with flat stages in stage races anymore, but it does ruin the classics that often end in a sprint such as Milan-San Remo, Tour of Flanders, Paris-Roubaix etc a bit.2. There is a lack of diversity in career mode due to having the same parcourse for each race year after year. After the first season in career mode is complete, none of the routes change and therefore the game becomes somewhat predictable. In one of the previous editions of the game the Tour de France route alternated between 2 differing routes. The game would be substantially improved if there was different routes every year, at least in the grand tours. Even if it was just the route models used by the devs in previous editions of game. For example, in the first year of career mode the Tour route was the 2017 route, in the second year it could be the 2014 route, the next the 2016 route and so on. This would make it much more difficult to acheive dominant runs of victories and give the game a much more realistic feel.3. Its far too easy for a rider to be 'blocked'. I appreciate it is not easy to move around a peloton, but sometimes it is ridiculous in the game. You can be in a small group of 4 or 5 riders, on wide roads, and one of the group attacks. You try to follow the attack and another rider directly in front of you doesn't, so your rider just sits their like a melon while the rest of the group disapear 2 or 3 minutes up the road and the race is over for you. Its infuriating. It is the same at the start of races with breakaways. You plan on sending a certain rider in the break, but by pure luck the rider you planned on sending has been positioned at the rear of the peloton when the stage generates. Sometimes it can take 40-50km for the rider to work his way to the front and by that time the breakaway is well and truely gone. There should be a neutralised roll out for a few km, as there is in real races, before each race where riders can 'ghost' through other riders to get to near the front. Also there should perhaps be a rider stat for 'positioning' which dictates how easy a rider can move though the peloton or hold a wheel.4. In career mode, rider contracts can only be negotiated after the 21st of July on the year the riders contract expires. I understand in reality teams cant announce new rider transfers before a certain period, but they can renegotiate their existing riders contracts at anytime and not only in the final 6 months of their existing deal. It makes it possible to lose over half you team with little notice. The contract negotations are simplistic at best. You basically negotiate the salary and duration. It would be better if you could offer bonuses or a signing fee to make up for a smaller salary and perhaps having the riders demand you sign a teammate etc. Also riders make demands, such as they want £70k p/m over 2 years, you then offer them that exact terms, they reject them saying they need a better offer and then when you renegotiate the offer they are still asking for £70k p/m over 2 years. Makes no sense. This can go one for months, you offer them much better than they are asking for and they reject it. This is annoying considering, as i said earlier, you have limited time to negotiate.5. The sponsorship parameters are very poor. Again, everything is left until the last minute, which i accept is a possibilty but it is not standard practice. You can sign a multi-year deal with a sponsor for a certain amount a year, but depending on how you perform in relation to your sponsors objectives they can raise or lower how much they pay you without warning. Whats the point in having a contract if they can just change the terms at will without consultation? This means you literally have no idea about your teams budget from year to year. You also have very little input into the sponsors objectives. They can demand you win in all disciplines of cycling, the cobbled classics, Ardennes classics, stage races and grand tours and sprints. In reality, most teams are predominatly focused on one or perhaps 2 aspect of cycling. You often don't find out who is sponsor you until late in the year and you literally dont find out what their objectives for you are until 1st of January. By this time you can sign new riders to help you fullfill these objectives. Sponsors should give you a flat and unchangeable rate for the term of the contract with bonuses for fullfilling objectives. Also being able to negotiate objectives at the before signing the contract would be an improvement.6. The TT stats are worthless. In the 40km slightly hilly Giro TT i had Tom Dumoulin (TT stat of 83) and he beat Davide Formolo (TT stat of 66) by only 28 seconds. Both were rated 78 for hills. You would expect Dumoulin to take a minimum of 2 minutes, probably closed to 4 minutes here. Non TT specialists doing extremely well against TT specialists seems to happen every TT i have done, irrespective whether i quick simulate or 3D race the stage."

I'm rating this on the merit of this game specifically and I'm not taking into account the lack of changes/improvements from previous games that I've heard complaints about. This is the first PCM I've bought and I'm really enjoying it. I'd have to give it an ok 6-7/10 though. The gameplay -while fun- is a little janky when it comes to animations. In terms of simulating bike races It's very good. The management aspect is good too but a little lacking in depth. A little more detail into rider progression (of attributes) would be good for example."

If you actually watch cycling and are familiar with much of the jargon, this is the best management game you will ever buy.  If you like Football Manager not because of the graphics, but because you feel like you actually are a football manager and are adding value to your team, you will love this game.  If you have a tiny brain and can't handle the intricate planning required to become Dave Brailsford, then don't buy this.  After 1 full season in career mode, you will have the measure of it and realise how many levels this game works on.  The graphics happen to be stunning too if you have a decent PC - most of the whingers don't have a PC capable of not crashing hence they write negative reviews.  Football Manager is obsessive and my favourite game of all time - not any more, this is even better on every level.  So engage your brain, challenge yourself and if you are obsessive like me, this game will totally captivate you."

76561198088259594,Recommended,525920,33783762,Posted: 25 July,all,BoogieDK,"** The Start of a Glorious Career**(This review is based on 2 seasons of “create your own biker” game mode)** I uploaded a real name DB from the workshop, I strongly suggest you do the same**So I created a young rider:Oscar Guldmeyer from Denmark ( World class potential, stage rider)Of the 3 offered teams ( 2 danish continental and 1 Spanish ConPro) I signed with  Team Veloconcept (the lowest rated Danish Con team) on a 1 year contract.The first season went pretty well, ofcourse I didn’t get to race in any of the “big” races because you have to unlock them by winning races or Jerseys, which I thought was a cool feature . . You have to earn your right to race in the more prestigious tours, classics and races.In the first season my “big” results were:Volta a Portugal do Futuro / Liberty Seguros, 4th place in the general standingsOlympias Tour, 6th in the general standingsTour Alsace, 6th in the general standingsTour de Limousin, Winner of the mountain jerseySuperprestige Points: 73 -> 456th place.After a decent debut season it was time to look at a new contract. Veloconcept offered a decent one but with the same criterias (2,500/week young rider), the team stood to be decimated and poached to♥♥♥♥♥♥by bigger teams. All teams that offered a contract was with the same stipulations so I decided to try a different team and the ContinentalPro team of Cara Rural – Seguros RGA (Spain) looked interesting so I took a step up and signed a 2 year contract.My second seasons biggest results was:Sibiu Cycling Tour: 9th in the general StandingsVolta ao Alentejo / Liberty Seguros: 7th in the general standingsVuelta a Castilla y Leon : Winner of the mountain standings.Danish Championships: 12thSuperprestige Points: 113 -> 316th placeI haven’t won a race yet so im still not allowed to race in the big races, but season 3 is gonna be my breakthrough season I just know it! Caja Rural have traded/lost the biggest stars and Im the second best rider on the team (based on AVG skill)  , which will mean more “Leader” roles in races.I expect that after this season I will be looking interesting for a Pro Tour Team.I give this a 3.5 / 5 with a thumbs up!There are issues though:Graphics engine – Especially the lower tier races are sometimes sloppy made so you ride into/through cars, spectators, TV cranes and such . . .Audio – They need a new commentator ASAP . they have used the same Audio since PCM14 atleast (The other version I have)The team orders – Sometimes they just don’t seem very realistic . . So a young rider needs to sit in atleast 80km breakaway AND finish 10th on the stage AND the general goal is to win the mountain jersey.New / Regen Riders progression rate : This is INSANE ! . .  A team-filler rider I started on the same team with in the first season at 68 AVG is now a whopping 76 and climbing , funny thing is I looked at his career and he havent won anything significant. My progression has been pretty good , because I have matched leader goals for me ( ""Best teammate"" is worth a good deal in xp) and secured a few good results for myself / The sponsors, my AVG is at 71 and 2/3 to 72Nearly all young riders have high stat climbs . .  Too many World Class riders at very young ageThis need to be tweaked in some way."
