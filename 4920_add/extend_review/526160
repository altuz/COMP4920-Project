,Recommended,526160,30041100,Posted: 19 February,all,longbeard180,"The Wild EightOn Saturday, February 18, 2017, my friend and I read the initial reviews and were skeptical of The Wild Eight. At this time it had only been released for several days. While I was more sold on the idea, my friend was hesitant because of some prior early access titles that were a huge letdown. The reviews implied that there were bugs, sketchy multiplayer servers, and some “boring” gameplay. After winning a bet with my friend, he decided to buy the game. We spawned into a server together and the game ran very well. We were almost immediately immersed, taking on our roles as airplane crashed survivors. After building a riddled tent and a shelter to make some tools, we began a small journey around the snowy woods. We spotted a rabbit. We chased it, throwing rocks at it and yelling. The rabbit got away. It was at this moment our stomachs began growling and our feet were turning purple. We died before making it back to camp. So we started over.After figuring out the basics, we set up a large and upgraded campsite, got a stockpile of food, and made ourselves some high tier clothes and weapons. This process took around a couple hours. Our new goal was to complete a series of quests and to discover what was on the map. I have to say, the map size and variability on The Wild Eight is very impressive. It immediately brought me back to my days on Terraria. We would get back from an hour long adventure and see that we only discovered about 5% of the total map size.Pros:Huge map with lots of variables and procedurally generated content.An actual storyline and main / side quests to be completed.Besides forest, areas exist such as caves, old facilities, and abandoned towns.Challenging gameplay, where hunger drains rapidly and the cold always lingers.Smooth graphics, 60 fps, and a great top-down engine.A soundtrack that is relaxing during the good times, and terrifying in the bad.A variety of NPC animals both to hunt, and to hunt you. Boss battles as well.Cons (most cons are only there because of early access bugs):Animations sometimes are glitchy. Your axe will swing a foot away from your arm, ECT.The animals will sometimes be out of sync with you and other players. My friend was killed by an animal that he couldn’t see and I could. He would swing at an animal when it appears 10 feet away.There is also building bugs between players. I sometimes can’t see structures that my friend builds.All in all, the gameplay is very challenging. If you die, your character’s leveling / building progress restarts and you have to loot your body for the gear you had. I would highly recommend to not play by yourself. On Saturday my friend and I got the game. We played for 13 hours straight. We still have lots more to do and discover. Bugs exist in this early state, but nothing game breaking. No crashes or failed saves or anything. If you enjoy survival games like Rust, a cooperative experience, and an adventure such as Terraria, then The Wild Eight, a 20 dollar price tag, is fully worth it and I highly recommend.UPDATE: We played in stretches for a couple more days and are now taking a break. We finished most main missions and discovered most of the map. Admittedly, we both rage quit after losing max gear / levels lol. We are awaiting further updates. In my opinion, my 16 hours of gametime were fully worth my 20 dollar purchase."

76561198253379063,Recommended,526160,32051066,Posted: 29 May,all,Not Guilty,"This game is outstanding for survival.  Look down below for my review.  Btw I played Survivor (the harder choice).Food/Hunger- This game isn't too demanding when it comes to food.  You have to eat every...2-5mins?  People are complaining about how it's too hard to find food.  You HAVE to explore, most food will be found near bunkers, radio stations,  power lines, etc.Exploring- The exploring part is pretty dull, but I can over look it since it's in early access.  All of the bunkers are different making the small amount of buildings interesting.  Most likely,  a little over half of your time exploring is going to be following power lines.  And about 40% of your time following those lines, you will be running from wolves (or bears).Animals- Wolves (and those pig nosed wolves) and just about every animal tends to outrun you unless you have throwing rocks.  Agressive animals have so much health, it'sjust....why?Trying to fight an animal is basically suicide unless you go back and forth throwing rocks or baiting them into turning around at campfires.Multiplayer- I have only played about 1 hour of multiplayer, so don't expect anything too amazing out of this section.Honestly, this game is so much fun when playing with people.  Most were nice enough to give me some food when I joined.  They also gave me tips such as constantly make campfires since they are basically saftey beacons."

,Recommended,526160,29827750,Posted: 10 February,all,Mindvox,"The Wild Eight is a low-poly survival/crafting game. Your plane has crashed in Alaska and it's up to you and anyone else who is alive (up to 8 players, obviously) to gather supplies and survive the harsh environment.++PROS++:+Graphics. This is obviously personal preference, but the graphic styling of this title is a low-poly/high-res mashup that works all too well, creating a very unique feel.+Audio! The soundtrack to this game is rather enjoyable. I sat in the title screen for a minute waiting for a buddy to setup a server and was surprised that the track playing was actually creating a sense of anxiety...perhaps foreshadowing.+Cannibalism! Do I really need to explain? I may or may not have eaten my brother...+Explore your map and push the limits of staying away from camp. Everytime you think you have enough food and inventory slots unlocked, the wind and wolves will remind you otherwise.+Collect cooperatively. Set up a battle plan and assign roles to your group instantly. A buddy and I survived 26 days (a 3 hour play session) by having him hunt/build traps while I ran around and gathered the necessary supplies to craft said traps.+Crafting is splendid, even in Early Access. It comes across as a little shallow at first (if you have played any other titles in the survival genre), but that's something I'm willing to accept considering the current game state. If you finally start to get ahead and have a nice little stock pile of supplies and food, start putting out storage chests at camp. Lumber and ore are the big players currently, collecting these in combination with unlocking different crafting recipes in your workshop allows the upgrading of your tools and structures: (axe and pickaxe--->Bone Axe/Bone pickaxe, etc.).+You'll have to hunt. Right now hunting is basically crafting stun rocks and hurling these stones of stun at unsuspecting wildlife and then sprinting up and beating them OR you can set up a flurry of traps and 'herd' the animals into them. It currently takes about 3 traps to knock a full health animal down into chow.+Skill Points/Skill Tree is realistic. You can level up your mobility(speed/sprint), your backpack's inventory capacity, the drop rate from animals/resources,etc. The way I see this is the longer you have survived, your character 'hardens' up. Can carry more, run faster for longer, etc.+There are actually quests! So surviving was hard enough, right? Now you have the opportunity to follow side quests and explore abandoned facilities, settlements and labs. This adds a level of depth to the game which isn't 'needed' but is definitely appreciated.+It's hard. That's right, I said it. You will get frustrated, you will panic, you will die. Accept this and try your best. Try not to freeze to death as you venture out.(hint: build a campfire right behind the resources you are harvesting and then you can work, relatively safe and relatively warm). If you die, that's it. You lose all that hard work you put into leveling up.--CONS--:-Multiplayer servers (as stated in other reviews) were maxed out and this caused connectivity issues. The devs however have actively replied on the forums and stated that they are aware of such and are putting more servers online.Last words:One of the few early access titles that I would actually encourage players to buy. Even in it's early access state, this game is worth every penny($19.99). I can't wait to watch The Wild Eight continue to grow/update and 'survive' the sh*tstorm of disappointing Early Access survival titles that plague the Steam Marketplace at the moment. Do yourself a favor (especially if you like hard games) and get this gem asap.**REVIEW UPDATE AS OF 2/17/2017**Thanks to 2 or 3 patches: (these are some of the updates that I've personally appreciated and noticed in game)You can now load a saved game without breaking UI.You can also select a region when joining or creating a server.Animals and buildings have all experienced multiple upgrades (buildings now provide immunity from blizzards and additional 50% cold defense and animals that have less than 25% HP are inflicted with a -30% speed debuff.)Weapons have had their bleed/stun chances altered(increased).EASY MODE IS AVAILABLE...that's right. If you thought the game was too hard originally, this option now exists. The effects of cold and hunger are reduced and you don't lose skills and structure levels upon dying.Campfire's have HP (something so simple being so game changing).Of course there are more bugs that have been fixed, items updated, etc. Make sure to check out the patch notes frequently. This game is moving fast. The devs are A+ in my opinion!Check out the FAQ:http://steamcommunity.com/app/526160/discussions/0/135508489637089295/Updates (since release into EA):http://steamcommunity.com/games/526160/announcements/detail/240217180981959374http://steamcommunity.com/games/526160/announcements/detail/240217512921348745http://steamcommunity.com/games/526160/announcements/detail/240217512933006981"

The survival part is nicely balanced without being too easy, and the exploration is thrilling! :)I particularly enjoy the fact that the survival is made easier by the unique skills of the people you play with. That's why generally play on open servers to meet nice people, but I would like to address this message to all the haters/trolls/mean people that are sometimes destroying what others built: you’re welcome to come any time in my server to steal, destroy, and break everything. Everything you steal we’ll farm again, everything you destroy we’ll build again, everything you break we’ll repair like brand new.That being said, make no mistake, if we ever meet, I will give you … a big hug, cause you must be really lonely, sad and angry at yourself to choose to do such things to others…Believe in yourself and others friends, and our lives will become lighter to carry and the world a better place!PeaceTheos"

,Recommended,526160,29790515,Posted: 8 February,all,Photosynthesis,"So far, so good! It's as if Don't Starve and The Long Dark (which I both love) had a child. The minimalistic polygon graphics makes the game look much better than the other games in the genre, which try and fail to look realistic. Sound design is also quality: the ambience of chilly winds and the cracking fire, a wolf howl in the distance - all make it a pleasanty lonesome experience. The gameplay is solid, very intuitive and a perfect base to implement more complex mechanics upon. I dare to say that this game beats every other early access survival game in terms of polish. I haven't encountered any bugs just yet, runs well and smooth on my system. Didn't have the chance to play co-op, but that should make the game much more entertaining.So far, the only thing that is in need of improvement is hunger. This stat needs balancing as you get hungry way too quickly. This issue has already been addressed by the developer and will get fixed soon. Also, I wish the time spent sleeping was more sped up, as it's not that interesting to spend a few minutes IRL just doing nothing and waiting for a blizzard or the night to pass.Congratulations on the launch, dear developers. Now keep on working on this game, implementing new features, expanding the story and you'll have a potential winner. Cheers!"
,Recommended,526160,29848659,Posted: 11 February,all,doge,"This game is very promising. It was supposed to be released as finished but instead came out in early access and that's okay. Although, the game is very punishing, it can be fun with a few friends as well. I was playing with three other friends and I reached day 31 before we all got off. I do agree that vitals go down too fast, but it's not really because they go down too fast, it's that days go by too fast. The way hunger progresses is how long you've gone without eating so if you eat at 8am, you may need to eat again around 6pm, which is realistic, but if time went by slower, making days and nights longer, it would fix this problem, and I think that people fail to realize that it's time going by too fast, not the hunger and heat. Overall, this game is very fun once you get the hang of it and there's an interesting story too!"

All great games, all have great penalties for death.After reading the reviews I've noticed that most of the bad reviews complain of losing your characters progress, and of difficult survival conditions. However, this survival system didn't give me much more of a problem than any other survival game I've ever played. In fact I've enjoyed this game immensely.The game has a calm but intense ambience that immerses you whether you want it or not, and the threat of death from the various elements - and its penalty - gets you excited for every small victory.The 8 characters to choose from are fun to explore, and trust me, you'll be given plenty opportunity to ""start"" a new character. ;)Most definitely worth the price, and most definitely full of potential. I've wasted more on cold chinese food that really wasn't too great even after I microwaved it.There are a few issues of course. I'm still unsure if food respawns or if there is a finite number, which wouldn't be a problem except that when you choose to ""respawn"" after death the map stays the same. I am almost certain however that I've picked berries off of the same bush more than once during my longest play through. That said, with the right technique food is not going to be hard to come by.I reccommend to new players to start a new game upon death. You will have the opportunity to try a new character, you will avoid any food respawn issues if existing(plenty of food regardless), and you will reap the benefits of the games map generation which always keeps things interesting.Dope game, dope concept, dope price.Try it."

When you die, be prepared to restart from square one. Make sure to have little resource stash's set around in wooden boxes.2. The game actually plays really well.

I havent played single player yet, as i always play multiplayer with a buddy, but multiplayer runs extremely smooth, although ive only played with one other person at one time!I can not wait to see the direction that they (AND WE) will take this game!

,Not Recommended,526160,30037590,Posted: 19 February,all,DerpyCat,"Not enough content to justify price at the moment, but it has potential.To start off this game looks great. It's not great in it looks realistic, it looks really pretty.The crafting and skill tree in this game I like a lot, especially that you can move most of the things you craft (though some like the furnace you should be able to move.)Blizzards and freezing in this game is great, I like them and how much they can screw you over.Hunting is meh, I see what they're trying to do but I really just don't like it.Now the main problem. I don't think there's enough in this game to cost $20 at the moment. Most of the time you're doing the exact same thing, just the more you upgrade the faster you do it. Go hunt, chop down trees, and get iron durring the game, occasionally waiting blizzard out in your tent, then light a fire and sleep durring the night.This game has a lot of potential and I did enjoy what I played of it, however I don't think there's enough here at the moment to justify $20.If Steam had an option in the middle of yes and no that's where I'd put it. If you're patient enough for the devs to add more content into this game then buy it, I don't think you'll regret it. If you're looking for something to play with friends maybe buy this, I think there's other survival games you should pick over this. If you want enough content to justify what you're paying for don't buy this at the moment.I've only played 102 minutes, however I think that's enough for what my main concern is. I played the singleplayer and got far on one, then I played two multiplayer servers where the guys on one of them already had highly upgraded stuff. We did the exact same thing in every single game.If you're looking at this a year later, ignore it because the devs have likely fixed most of my issues.Before someone brings this up, I knew what I was getting into when I bought an early access game, don't think I didn't."
76561198089034168,Recommended,526160,30898599,Posted: 2 April,all,Mytrivall,"Okay so I beat this games Act:1 on single player before easy mode came out and quite honestly playing with more people on multiplayer (Max amount of people) became really tedious when waiting for the entire group to move out after gathering food and deforesting the surronding area. I really enjoyed playing this dispite that, bring freinds, maybe just not so many.The idea is to explore and survive. You must manage Heat, Hunger, Resources, and Inventory space.My biggest problem at the start wouldv'e been learning the game itself. You have wolves, bears, and other creatures out in the frozen landscape to contend with. Food is scarce at the start with no real weapon to kill for food, using only traps and sheer willpower to hunt rabbits and kill deer (the occasional boar with the trusty help of a fire). As you progress you can explore the map at your own peril, finding what I like to call ""rare loot"" and side quests to learn about the mysterious activities of the ""locals"". Otherwise you can continue down the main story line staving off wolfs, boars, and bears with throwing rocks and sprinting away or take the fight to them and claim the frozen tundra for yourself, all the while huddling next to your fire, finding meager food sources, and surviving the cold blizzard nights. Base upgrades are a progressive thing and Tier-3 buildings are easy to survive on until you find a way to gather better resources.The game does have some unforunate things for instance if you die and have to run all the way back to your gear pile after your dead body was ravaged by wolves on your way back. Your buildings also seem to succumb to an unfortunate dissappearing act forcing you to create new ones, materials and all. Be wise of your resources as well, they tend not to come back, after all think about it, what tree grows back in a day or rock sprout from the earth? Animals are plentiful, wolves seems to breed like rabbits and rabbits seem hard to come by. (At least seeing one before they are caught in a trap.) Your stats reset upon death as well, which can cause people to scream internally or externally. You did die though, perhaps you are thinking of some other game which saves a clone of you at your highest levels?Be forewarned, you can save and come back. This does NOT reset the ""playing field"", all of the resources taken will still be gone upon returning to your survivor.I really enjoyed the first act. I am currently, patiently, waiting for the second to come. I would recomend this game to anyone who likes to be challenged and has patience. Survival is not something you rush."

It's very challenging in the beginning, but eventually things will get easier for around an hour though when you actually believe you've gotten somewhere, a wolf a blizzard, hunger and cold comes rushing at you and you die..When you die, you die, you loose all your skills learned, all your gear, all upgraded buildings.. EVERYTHING!!!! AND IT IS FRUSTRATING!!! Though if you have a friend in your game that actually managed to stay alive you will get on your feet a lot quicker, and you will be able to find your gear, but there is no waypoint and you don't really have time to look at your map running for your life..Even though it's a very unforgiving game, you can play on easy mode which allows you to keep all your stats and gear, but where is the fun in that? It's a survival game, you gotta struggle!After playing a few hours and dying multiple times i would give it a 10/10, though it would be great to have a waypoint where you died...I strongly reccomend the game, and have not found any bugs yet even when it's in EA!I also strongly recommend playing with a friend!"
76561198070413486,Not Recommended,526160,33954223,Posted: 1 August,all,RonEmpire,"TLDR:Game mechanics that creates impossible solution becomes game breaking.   Unreachable Items ""bug"" breaks the game- thus makes a very unpleasant game experience.  Lots of Frustration only to realize that the game can't be completed.Too many poorly designed game mechanics with the environment that causes alot of 'stuck' bugs.  Stuck as in your character can get physically stuck.   And Stuck as in the game is at a dead end/road block because quest items can fall off your character and become unreachable which makes the game impossible to complete without starting over losing all progress in explorer mode.Other examples of really bad game design mechanic is the room with the 59seconds timer, where you're suppose to explore/rush around looking for stuff before the door closes and locks your character inside.   It is possible to lose items in this room and never get them back.  Its possible to not retrieve the memory card (quest item) if you run out and the door is locked.The time travel room, where if you drop items in the past, there's no way to get the items back. since it was a one way trip.The bone pit trap that takes you to a cave, items can be dropped but can't be looted because it doesnt actually fall into the pit because falling into the pit is a 'teleport to another map that simulates you being in the pit.These mechanics are just game breaking.   Unreachable Items ""bug"" breaks the game.If you're playing in explorer mode, save game feature should allow for you to load the game from a previous state before it was broken. in this game,  every mode is iron man mode.  auto saves wipes out previous saves."

It reminds me of The Long Dark, which is a much better game.If you own The Long Dark and are just looking for something to pass the time, you could do worse than this game.It's very stable, it just gets extremely repetitive extremely quickly after you figure out how to feed yourself by killing animals.  Basically, after you can kill animals it's just endless killing and wandering around and there's not much survival to it.  You'll learn a few strategies, mainly sleeping during blizzards and carrying your tent and workbench with you instead of trying to make a permanent camp, and then the game is pretty static.Keep an eye out on this if you're interested, but I'd wait a year before purchasing.  This is more of an iOS game than a PC game.  It's just not very complicated."

Early access means a lot of different things to different companies.I have played this game a fair amount and I really have been enjoying it a lot.I have hosted a game many time and even overnight, not once have I had problems with connections, lag or anything really.Multiplayer is very stable and enjoyable.There are a lot of problems revolving around no UI pink/black screens and we're told a fix is in the works. For now though there is a work around witrh starting a new game, exiting, then loading the game in question. This has worked for every one of my situations and for those that I've read up on.The game is a low poly beautiful, deadly world. preperation is key and you will die almost entirly by over extending yourself in one way or another. Currently this is a hardcore survival. This means that when you die, you lose all of your levels and buildings. Some are okay with this, some are not.   easy/hard modes are in the works now.All in all I would absolutly reccomend this game.Its enjoyable, the right amount of difficult, it mas a light tutorial and a quest line you either can or cannot follow.It's a beautiful game and the multiplayer is amazing, I have had so much fun in this game so far.It's worth nmoting that there was a high volume of feedback on the hunger system and it was one of the first things to be tweaked. (it was dropping much too fast) This has since been corrected. This shows the Devs are reading the forums and acting appropriatly. I'm not great at reviews I hoe it helped a bit"

And the fire hit box displays behind the equipment box you are trying to drag an item to.

There is a story behind the whole game, but neither would I comment nor spoiler it at this point.When starting the game, you can select a character, each having their own advantages (reduced building costs, better collection rates, better medi-packs etc). After waking up, there is a quick tutorial to help you with the basic mechanics, and then you are on your own. There is a starter quest which you can follow once prepared.Thoughts in general (written during release version):The game so far looks polished and is pretty hard due to the quick hunger system. I suggest dying near your spawn.Berries do grow in bushes, so look out for them :)Update: Multiplayer is a little wonky, the first game was with 3 other friendly players and I got kicked out a little random. Fun while it lasted.About the food:Mushrooms are your friend. Animals run away too fast, no point in trying to catch up until you get some kind of ranged attack. Check the floor for canned food. Die near the spawn...and...well, eat your fleshy remains :D"

This game is brutal at times unless you rush the best materials, but if you don't want the game to be as hardcore with losing all your levels, play Explorer mode. It's equally as fun.I should also add that the developers are awesome. They clearly dedicate a lot of time to fixing issues people bring up. The desync issue with picking up items was the only complaint from me, which was as easy as leaving and rejoining to fix. But I look again and it's fixed.I love the content and it seems like a really fun game to work on. I envy the developer team and they clearly have a lot of passion put into this game. Give it a try.

This would be a fashionable feature similar to that of Firewatch and longdark."
,Recommended,526160,30326390,Posted: 4 March,all,Cenniy,"This game exceeded expectations for me! I have played this with a few friends and hours just slip by as you combat the harsh weather, defeat difficult AI, conquer your surroundings, all whilst discovering the story engraved into the Alaskan wilds.Firstly, the story is incredible, if you have the patience to do the grinding to get the levels. The game is so much more rewarding with a few friends to play with, as the element of difficulty remains, yet objectives are easier to reach. A lot of negative reviews highlight the 'lack of content' in this game, yet I have to staunchly disagree. There is a plot, and it's very interesting. I have only ever reached the 'end of part one' after 4 hours playing with friends, so there's defintely way more to this game than meets the eye.Obviously some down sides to this game are that there are glitches. At the time of writing this game is in early access, yet I've seen a few patches and a few updates to the game, so the devs are clearly still working on the game. Even so, some of the glitches are 'game breaking'. I died when I was flung into the air having defeated a wolf after 3 hours of playing. Needless to say I had zero motivation to continue that game and reclaim my stuff after grinding for so long. However, I know I'll pick up the game again within 24 hours and have another crack.Overall, I'd say this game, once the bugs are ironed out, will warrant a 10/10 rating. At the moment it's 9/10, with huge potential. It's defining a new path for survival games, smashing 'bars' set by games like Don't Starve Together. Can't wait to sink my teeth into this game some more, and I'm hoping the developers add lots more to the game to make it action packed!"

This game takes some time to get used to, I would say give it at least 3 hours before giving up and bashing the game in the reviews. Once you get the hang of things it becomes much easier. By my 4th or 5th attempt the game seemed significantly easier than it was the previous tries, and that's just solo. The co-op experience is amazing and much easier, probably one of the best co-op survival games out there. Once you get a good group of friends and start making progress the game gets crazy addicting.I personally have been playing on the 'EXPLORER' mode and will continue to until I can get a better grasp on how the game should be played and patterns in it that will help make progress in the 'SURVIVOR' mode, and if you are hoping to get the most out of this game, I recommend the same.Basically this game takes time, so do not get it if you are looking for some super lax casual survival stuff that you're not willing to put time into.All in all the story is intriguing with a giant map, the survival aspects are difficult but realistic, and it is a great game to play with friends. And it's still being updated, with the massive bunker update coming out recently, the devs are clearly putting a lot of effort into making the game even greater than it is. Totally recommend this game, the people hating on it either don't understand what the game is supposed to be or are mad that later in the story you will face supernatural enemies."

Also, bone spear is OP in comparison to other rubbish melee weapons, especially steel sword and mace; I don't understand what is so good about 10% stun and bleeding with less DPS.- Lack of convenient UI: perks say 'increased damage' but by how much?- Hardcore gameplay: wolves are way too strong in comparison to characters full builds...

But it a enjoyable experience and has a very addicting loop and can be a joy to explore.  The core loop revolves around you leveling up your hunting/mobality/combat skills till you reach a specific point to be able to adventure on your on and follow the story... The core issue with the game comes from the fact on death it doesn't fully reset depending how far you gotten it can be almost impossible to reasonably continue the game due to the fact there nothing left to hunt in the spawn area and finding the requirements to relevel up all your skills can be next to impossible if you die at lets say the last quest in the game... The game boardline is unfair at times and requires you to cheese or abuse mechanics to progress...  You might find yourself stacking trap or running around stunning and attacking...  At the end of the game...  Overal there a ton of potentional and a enjoyable loop

The sounds, environment design, and character diversity are outstanding. This game is difficult at the start and you will die a few times getting used to it, but you will slowly learn the most efficient ways of crafting, eating, and keeping warm in order to survive. Overall Review:Pros:- Design team did an amazing job. Everything looks so pretty and attractive.- Sounds of players, environment, and animals are A+.- Wide variety of upgrade features and things to craft.- Tons of food choices. Need to strategize towards certain animals in order to kill them and are rewarded big time for it.- HUGE Map.- Could play for hours.Cons:- Difficult at start and does have a learning curve, but you can try out all the characters while you learn the game and see which one you like the best.- Get hungry way too fast, and get cold way too fast. Your'e going to always need some type of heat source on you or available to craft. Torches don't heat you up (they should in my opinion).- Would be cool if they had a male and female option for each character at the start. Guess that's why it's called The Wild Eight and not The Wild Sixteen.Overall Grade:A - Beautiful game that is definitely worth the price for an early access. Already have an hour and a half and I want to play tons more. Thank you developers! Keep updating and working on stuff to keep the community happy :)"

Would recommend hands down.Id like to commend the devs on a job well done, and encourage you as you build on this awesome foundation!! Looking forward to future updates!!For sure worth the money!! 8.5/10"

( PLEASE FIX THAT)Second, when you die you shouldn't be a perma death. It's kinda redundant having to keep reapplying your skills after so long of TRYING to survive. i mean i love survival games i have plenty of them and i have my own servers also, but the survival on this game is to unbalanced right now it seems.Thirdly, the crafting in the game is has a very good concept and i like how you have to cook your food by dragging it over the campfire! Also i just hope that some of these things can get fixed ASAP. for myself its just to frustrating to have to try and keep up with your food degrading so quickly and then turn around and stay warm etc... not to mention if you die you lose everything even your Skills. please at least make it an option in the start menu to change weather its a perma death or not!Great Game so far the wife and myself played it non-stop for over 3 hrs until we got tired of the perma deaths LoL."

,Not Recommended,526160,30136737,Posted: 24 February,all,Kalthramis,"Game is pretty similar to ""Wilderness Survival"", an old Warcraft 3 custom map.Bear in mind this is early access, so not all my complaints might be valid by the time you read this. I also have not played multiplayer, and steam's recorded time is not representative. I've played about 12 hours as of writing this.First up as a knock to the company, they claimed during the Kickstarter this game would be RELEASED in 2016, and evidently do not understand the difference between release and Early Access. I am not a Kickstarter backer, and while delays are expected for any game, there is a big difference between ""prealpha early access garbage state"" and ""released game."" Even leading up to the release of Early Access, they paraded as though the game was about to see a full release.Now onto the game.BasicsGameplay itself handles well enough. However, the UI is a ""click andor drag everything"" nightmare that's about as generic as can be, and reeks of ""We puked this in a few days with little to no thought."" There are few to no hotkeys as well. Overall the game is very easy, and within an hour and two deaths, I road the game to finish.The 8 characters you can select are all boring, with most stats being ""+10% wood gathered!"" that hardly makes them feel different. The game's polygon artstyle makes the players look especially horrible, and all the gear that isn't Fur looks absolutely ridiculous. Considering how generic and uninspiried the characters are, it's a wonder they didn't just give you a character creator and let you set up your own perks. Would defeat the purpose of the title, I suppose, but might make it feel more personal, specialized, and engaging.The artstyle itself isn't BAD, but the player characters look bad with it.As I mention below, the 'pack up your hut and go' mechanic removes any semblence of making a 'home base' or camp, which I personally, think is disappointing. In my opinion. I like basecamps where groups can stockpile crap they find, and build permanent, useful structures. The massive amount of wood you need also works against this, as you begin clearing forests in no time to keep up with equipment and upgrades.Crafting...Is simplistic, at best. You have a few tiers for armor; wood -> leather -> padded leather -> fur. You can hit Fur in about 20 minutes easy, probably quicker once you know the game well enough. Boots wear out hilariously fast and any extra armor you find, ex. a biker helmet, is nigh-on worthless because the end-game mobs will kill you in a hit or two anyways, and the armor tradeoff isn't worth the cold tradeoff. Personal opinion, I suppose, but that's my take.Weapons/tools boil down to ""stone -> better stone -> bone -> better bone -> iron"". Even iron tools wear out pretty quick, so if you're going on a gathering-spree, may as well bring 4 or 5 stone axes and go to work. Again, feels lackluster and poorly thoughtout. ""Let's just do what every single other survival game does!""The way you progress through tiers is by 'upgrading' your buildings, which you can just pack up in your pocket and run off with. Beyond feeling like a cheap way to gate the player and eat up resources, it's not particularly interesting and being able to pack them up removes any feeling of setting up a 'camp' or home base.CombatClicky clicky, physics are freaky. Essentially it boils down to ""carry a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of throwing stones and a sword/bow."" As many of the later mobs like to charge you and hit you for 1/2 your health in one blow, you either stun them and run to the next screen to lose aggro, or stun them and hit/shoot them, run around in a circle, rinse repeat. Not particularly engaging or interesting, and the animations are so clunky and slow that it isn't very satisfying.ProgressionYou 'progress' your character via your tent, which is also upgradable. Every action you do, be it combat, mining, or just walking, levels something up. Most of the upgrades are fairly generic, like ""Get more wood per swing, increase your max-wood stack from 80 to 100, here's another bag slot"". Resources from hunting (hunting is your most important gathering, i'd say, early on) are gated behind these levels, and you cannot access a level 3 skill without putting at least one point into level 2. That isn't to say the level 3 skill is any better, it's just an arbitraty requirement that prevents you from specializing your character.Infact, as every tree has its own skillpoint currency, and its so easy to get points/there are so few abilities, you can easily max out your character, removing any sense of specializiation for multiplayer. Sure, in the first hour you can have the ""guy with extra bag space"" and ""the guy with slightly better wood gathering"", but that's as far as you're going to get for being a special snowflake on your team.Story (spoiler)...Quickly becomes a 'what the ♥♥♥♥?' What was teased to be a 'dark, mysterious, and spooky story!' nearly instantly becomes a ""Did a 12 year old write this?"" Here's a spoiler warning ---- Werewolves. By radiation. In a secret.. military... base. That's the story. OoohhOOoo! Spooky! Right? As for the ending: The corniest lines you've ever seen, followed by a random dude shooting himself and turning into a BIGGG SPOOKYY GHOSSSTT! I mean, come on. Of all the stories you could have included, this is probably the dumbest.  Granted there's probably more to come, but I'm reviewing the game in the current stage. Promises of 'more to come' aren't always fullfilled.As an extra note; the first time you encounter a werewolf is the cheapest, dumbest way possible: In a cramped bunker with tight corridors, where - unless you're in a big group of players - your only real option is to stun-shoot it until you're out of the bunker, then you run back in and rinse/repeat. Not compelling and feels more like a cheap way attempt at killing the character and having you start over.The 'story' itself is also pretty short. You could blast through it in a few hours. Maybe, 8, if you took it really slow and steady. Took me about 9 solo.Map Design/MiscShoutout to the sound/VFX guys for making the game legitimately feel cold, and pretty decent sound effects all around. Not great, but a solid 7.5/10~. As for the map/level design, you run into invisible walls everywhere around rocks, cliffs, mildly steep hills, ect. But wait! There are no invisible walls near sunken-cliffs, and falling is an instant death. That tree you see that looks like a very slight shortcut to the other side? Good luck, the movement controls are impreceise enough that you'll either instadie trying, or take way longer scooching yourself across.Beyond that, the generated terrain quickly becomes repetitive. There are not enough setpieces, and you'll start running into duplicates areas within the first hour or so. I'd imagine in mere minutes if you're in a full multiplayer game.ConclusionCurrently, I don't think this game is worth your time, unless you're going in with a group of friends. I have no idea what state multiplayer is currently in, but I think you could get a solid 3~ hours of palling around and having fun before the scarcity and shallowness begins to set in. Would be a fun lan-game, I think; but not a game to buy a dedicated server for and dedicate your Friday nights to.For the solo player, I'd recommend waiting and see where this goes. As is, it is not aimed nor designed for single player, and is far too empty and simplistic to be especially compelling solo."

I'm a casual gamer when it comes to survival, and it's not too hard that I can't pick it up, but it's not too easy that I'm bored of it quickly. There's a lot of area to explore, interesting ""puzzles"" (if you can call them that), and other aspects that make the game challenging, but fun. The only reason I picked the game up was for the multiplayer, and to me this is purely a multiplayer game, but that's simply because I've never been good at survival lol.."

This one has one room in my heart.It has simple graphics but yet beautiful. I love the theme to survive in the middle of nowhere in Alaska. It’s us against Nature, the animals and the weather itself.ExploreThe Map is Damn Huge and there were plenty things to do. Well, I haven’t fully explored all of it since I was focusing on the story. There are caves, higher ground, lower ground, abandoned places cliffs. They were all beautiful and I’m hoping some village or houses on the next chapter.CooperateHaven’t tried this one yet.SurviveI love how it works with the campfire, it has a different distance of light & warm. The hunger … Oh I kinda hate this one, it was so fast to get hungry in this game and it was weird to eat a mutated meat.Craft & ImproveCrafting and upgrading skills are simple and fun. Even I have to chop down countless trees (again).Hunt or be HuntedI love how the wolves hunted me but surely I hate the moment where I met werewolves or mutant. Damn, they required so much of my resource to survive.This game is quite Mad in punishing players when they die or didn’t survive. You might eat your previous body (kinda teach you to be Hannibal) and get items that you lost, BUT, you lost your progress. Yeah, all the skills back to zero, kinda teach you to be very very careful in surviving I guess.Is it worth it? As an EA game, yes it is. I haven’t encountered any bugs so far. I might have stuck on the 1st day but they fix it the next day. The developer is responsive and willing to discuss with us (as long we polite).Since I have done the 1st chapter, I’ll renew the review once the update comes in."

,Recommended,526160,33085396,Posted: 1 July,all,Dingo Stole My Keyboard,"A brutal game where you spend the day hunting to survive the next day, slowly you build up enough food to not have to hunt and set up camp elsewhere. Then repeat.Only played multiplayer which works without any noticable issues unless the host lags. If the host has poor internet picking up and harvesting is delayed but you can still move normally. If the host super lags you can't move. I saw de-sync once in my 2.5 hours of play where another player killed a boar at a distance from my perspective. So overall it works pretty well.A couple of complaints for the DEVs: Unless four people missed something the only way to drop something is to throw it which is annoying. Drag and drop from the hotbar should be the way to drop things. Picking up items is also annoying, please make it easier to pick up items otherwise you tend to hit the person closest to the item.Sprinting should be a default ability and not  a researchable option.The underlying storyline and quests are interesting.

I'm not sure if that's really how it's intended or if it's a bug, but each hour is about 30 seconds of play time. And after about 4 hours my cold and hunger were already down to 75%. Meaning if I wandered around without finding a plethora of food and make it back to a campfire, I'm dead within 8 minutes. My math may be off, but each hour is absolutely less than a minute, which is insanely fast.That feels way too fast. I get the idea of wanting a hardcore survival game, but if I can't make it 4 minutes away from my camp, I can't really explore any of the content the devs have planned and implemented.I'm going to hold off and hope it's a bug, and that it gets fixed.

It seems like you need multiple people to survive at this point. Hunger degradation is pretty rapid to the point that me and my husband had issues keeping up with our hunger demands in multiplayer. The crafting system is nice and different from the norm. I also wish that you didn't lose all of your skills everytime you die. It would be nice to see them make you able to use all of the buildings as a community instead of every person needing their own workshop to craft from. The shelter I understand but the other buildings should be open for use in my opinion. I'd also like them to make your shelter location, once you place one, your spawn point instead of respawning at the crash site everytime you die. It's a pain once you've hunkered down somewhere further. I'm not that far into the story line so I am not aware if that is an option later on down the road. My last suggestion is how great it would be to add the option of first person view as I am a big fan of immersion in survival games. It is the start of another great survival game. I do feel that if you are willing to deal with a few aggrivations and have some friends to play with it is a worthwhile investment."

I realize most of the negative feedback for this game is about the difficulty and the early-early access.This is a survival game that actually requires patience, and skill in order to make it in the frozen wastes. I spent 5 hours grinding for materials, making armor/tools, upgrading and after doing all that, i felt it was time to move. I made one tiny mistake, not carrying mats to make a campfire. That was enough to get me killed and lose 5 hours of progress. I was being chased down by wolves and didn't have time to clear my inventory and stop to chop wood.Honestly, after getting about 30-60 minutes in, you should be good on food/hypothermia, but wildlife can be a ♥♥♥♥♥. All my deaths have been due to very bad, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ timing. And this game sure knows how to kick you in the ♥♥♥♥ing balls while you're down.That death left a bitter taste in my mouth, but i'll be honest; The game is actually alot of fun, very addicting and has co-op. For once, a survival game is hard, and not about PvP and raiding bases.Some additional keywords that made the gameplay even better:- Pretty graphics.- Some ""thriller"" feel to it.- A ""backstory""- Simple, yet informative UI.- Bigger map than expected."

Just surviving, levelling up and working up the tiers crafting new stuff is pretty fun in its own right, and delivers a very acceptable survival experience. However the game is also littered with various intruiging questlines that the player is free to advance whenever they like - and feel they are able. You see, certain encounters are way beyond a player who is not yet properly equipped for them, giving the game a slightly grindy feel, punctuated by significant milestones and boss fights). Fortunately the grind is fun and you always feel like you are progressing and improving your character.Enjoying it so far (single player only) even if it is a tad over-priced for what you get.But I am a sucker for games that feature creepy nightimes spent huddling round a warming campfire.7.5 / 10(this score will rise if the game develops positively and they add the ability to rebind all the keys instead of only some of them)"

Hunger is also a big challenge and you have to quickly get enough to survive and stay alive.You will die over and over again, lose your skills points and loose upgrades you have done to any player craftable structures.There are dangers out in the world that you will have to keep an eye on. Don't go blindly exploring unless you can defend yourself.Playing with friends brings its own challenges, suddenly you have more mouths to feed so you are constantly having to gather and hunt.This makes a refreshing change to some survival games that pose no real survival challenges except to watch out for other players.There is a quest system in the game, but apart from the basic tutorial and a couple of the missions following that I haven't done much of this.The devs seem to be active in the forums replying to questions and taking suggestions on new content or changes to existing content.If you are looking for a survival game that is challenging then this is the one for you."

Or if you're a ♥♥♥♥ing badass and think you can handle the♥♥♥♥♥♥that this game throws at you, and trust me, it throws a lot. The game is challenging, yet rewarding and I really do like the direction that it's headed in and I think the game has a lot of potential. For $20, I got about 10 hours out of the game until myself and a friend finished part 1.  I honestly feel like this is one of the most complete and worth the buy, early access games, that I have ever purchased.

It's not really a difficult survival game if you are a fan of the genre, you pretty much know the basics already and you will be able to keep yourself sustained until you level up your skills enough to be an effective hunter, once I got the bone spear, I was back at the top of the food chain and the major survival treath which were wolves were now my prey.Wildlife is abundant to the point that boars and rabbits were wandering right outside my camp, I haven't felt the need to put up traps, as after a bit of running around I am pretty much as fast or faster than a deer, and all I have to do is throw rocks and spear everything to death, a day of hunting gives me all I need for the next 2-3 days and the herbs to make healing items are everywhere.I started out having some minor diffiulties, but in a pretty short time I reached the point where nothing really seems like a treath.What I would love to see is a brutal difficulty, where wildlife is 1/4th of what it is on classic and wolves become extremely deadly. The classic mode is good if you want to learn the basics of a survival game, but it's not a challenge to me.This game has potential, and I would reccomend it, but don't expect it to be as difficult as some try to make it out to be."

The first day the early access was released their was an issue with how fast your food and warmth bars were draining and the game would crash every now and then. The devs have already released a hot fix for these issues. Early access games seem to be plagued with devs that just don't care about the game they released and just want your money but that doesn't seem to be the case with this company, they are actively monitoring the player feedback and are providing solutions to keep you happy.While the game is fun to play by yourself, the multiplayer feature is amazing.

,Not Recommended,526160,30019351,Posted: 18 February,all,Ruruwawa,"The Wild Eight has a lot of potential.  Surprisingly good survivial and crafting for a top down game.It also has one very big flaw and that's the reason for the negative review.  The problem is the user interface, specifically during combat.  It's not a bug per se, it's a funky design.Say you want to use a health potion.  In most PC games you hit the keybind for the potion between your combats skills.  In the Wild Eight, you 1) equip the potion.  This unequips your ""stun"" weapon -- throwing rocks -- which are are essential for combat.  Then 2) use the potion, then 3) equip the throwing rocks again.  THREE KEYS TO USE A POTION!It gets worse.  If you miss re-enquipping throwing rocks, then you start throwing away whatever you last touched in inventory (probably your potions) one by one, instead of rocks.  BTW, these non-combat items do nothing to the enemy during combat, btw.  The result is that you are less effective in combat, and get to spend yet more time gathering up all your items and managing your inventory.Worse yet, you can carry multiple stacks of those handy throwing rocks, but you need to explicitly change inventory slots in combat to use rocks from the next stack.  You throw the rocks by right-clicking the mob.  If you use up all the rocks in the active inventory slot,  right-click no longer works.  Even if you still have 100 rocks in your bags, it's no-op.  You need to find an inventory slot with more rocks and press that number to re-enable rock throwing.Of course it's possible to fight with this system, but combat in the Wild Eight requires constant inventory management.  It's not fluid, it breaks immersion.Same goes for harvesting.  It's not enough to carry an axe in your inventory, you need to explicitly equip the right one to chop wood with your axe.  Forget to do that?  You'll wear down your weapon stabbing the tree while you harvest wood very slowly.  And because your touched your inventory to equip the axe your need to reselect those throwing rocks again.  Because if you don't, you'll be chucking something else out of your inventory next time you enter combat.Most action games perform actions with one click or keybind -- not three.  Most action games separate combat from inventory management.  Most action games abstract away details like equipping the axe you're already carrying to chop wood.  I feel the Wild Eight would benefit enormously from following these examples.   Aside from these flaws it's a promising game."

,Not Recommended,526160,32806607,Posted: 26 June,all,Avain,"Refunded it before you could say ""Early Access.""The game, at least early on, is completely about running into the trees and finding food. If you don't do this, and dedicate all your time to this, you will soon die of starvation. And don't think for a second that it'll be a slow death; you'll die in under fifteen seconds after your hunger bar depletes. To top it off, it's nearly impossible to hunt in early game, yet you need to hunt to get the skills to get things you need from animals to craft the very weapons you'd be using to hunt.The average hunting experience is getting your friend to jog at the animal with you and throw 'throwing stones' at it so it is stunned, one of you hitting it with a pick or club while the other spams throwing stones. Don't ask me how to do it in singleplayer. The other way is tediously placing rabbit traps, if you somehow have the time (food) to actually do that. You'll have ten pieces of rabbit meat one day, and think you're good for a bit.No.It'll slide right down to zero again, before you even think of resetting the traps. The amount of time you need to reset the traps in the correct places would barely make the ends meet. Heres the kicker:Your buildings reset when you die.Yup. Your constant race for mushrooms, berries, and the occasional bit of rabbit meat will never stop, because if you don't play on the casual setting, if you die once, all your progress resets. Including all that time wasted on getting EXP so you can get crafting items from the rabbits.The big issue, if you haven't noticed, is the food. I understand the need to have food in a survival game, but it's too much here, it's making it impossible to explore. The farthest me and my friend explored was some sort ranger station or something, but we died of hunger on the way back. To top it off, it makes it a time crunch for being able to gather resources to actually make the buildings. You know, the buildings that you lose when you ultimately die of starvation.3/10 would rather starve than play again."

The long Dark is another similar game. If you like Dont Starve/The Long Dark, then you will like this game. If you hate time essential games then you will not like this game. You either love it or you hate it kind of game. Some people are giving it a bad review because they are dying from starvation or freezing. I dont think the game needs to be tweaked in that regards.What are you doing in game?Its free roam. There is a goal, but you can go where you want. You are constantly looking at your hunger and cold stats. And these are the most killers. You will often die numerous times just to figure out what you need to do to survive and then thrive. The map is randomized to an exctent.Is it worth $20?I was jumping back and forth the first couple hours on whether to refund this game or not. After i hit the 2 hour mark, i decided to just keep playing it since i own it now. And i am glad I did. I would not of realized this real gem if i refunded in the first 2 hours. Most likely in the first 2 hours, you are just going to be figuring out the AI and how to survive....not much else. And there is much more to this game. I consider a game worth it if i spend $1 an hour on it. So if you can imagine yourself playing 20+ hours ($20 = 20 hours), then it is worth it.How are the devs?They take input from the steam forums for future features. The make patches. So far they seem very well linked with their users. They have promised more features and bugfixes. Yes there are bugs present, but it is in development. These are to be expected. There are currently obviosuly missing features, but they are promised by the devs to be in future updates. So far i trust these devs. I see other reviewers who base their review on bugs/missing features/etc. But the game is evolving day to day at this point. Bugs will be fixed so why give it a bad review because of that? The devs respond to bug threads saying that they know about it and are fixing it, or whether you informed them of a fresh bug, etc. Based on the devs in discussion this is chapter 1 of 3. So they are planning much more.My Opinion:When i was playing Dont Starve and got sick of it, I wanted a game like it, but not itself. This is what i was looking for. This is a game you have to die to learn how to survive. Sometimes I just have to put the game away for a day or so after death. But I keep coming back for more.NOTE: I am a loner, and prefer to play games in single player. So these are reflections based on single player.UPDATE:So far i am about 12 hours on this game. I have figured out how to stay alive...but i feel like i have not explored much at all. I feel like i am just starting the game.UPDATE2:After 40+ hours in game....In the beginning your mode is survival, but after you beef up your stats your mode switches to exploring. The game has the same quests, but because of the random generation, it makes replayability available. Once you are able to beat the game and go 100% everywhere the game starts to get a little boring afterwords. One of the nice things is things are random. So a single wolf attack might be a pack of wolves attack in the next game. Once you know how to run through the levels quickly you start to get bored having to restart.Multiplayer:I started on single player, but i noticed over time that multiplayer seems to be more fun, can get you more game time, and makes it easier. For example if you do it co-op another player can drop off leather to you after you die, to help up you level up quickly. They can give you iron tools, food, etc. As after you are leveled up they are not as dire as when you first start. So it can make it easier to play with other people. If you join a server, you can save and exit and use that save file later by yourself. Most people prefer co-op, but some people do a PvP server....and the fire pits give away your position...but yet is required. So there are a couple of different game play types. For co-op...2-4 people are a good number if you all agree to do quests together. Its more fun than each person doing a quest on their own. 8 people you miss out on quests...its just too many people."

I have to agree on the hunger level from other reviews as well as the controls. The game for me right away was dominated by trying to find food. If you die, You're better off starting a new game to have the extra food at the beginning, unless you've progressed your character and want to retain your items. The controls for me, would work better if i could just hold the 'W' key and use the mouse to directionalize the character versus the current control set. Nonetheless, this will not be a game i uninstall and am very excited to see this one develope. If the two suggestions were already implemented i wouldnt be writing this review, Id still be playing!!!9/10"

Little bunny took off like a bullet after taking damage from the ttack. Not to mention, the rabbit traps don't work. Like, at all. I placed a ton of them, and the rabbits avoid them like...well...a trap. It says in the item description ""Attracts rabits in the area"" and this is a blatant lie.

76561198120794179,Not Recommended,526160,30548939,Posted: 16 March,all,SoilBurn,"I really, really want to give the game a good rating. Because it just has the potential to get there. It is unique, has an amazing atmosphere and rewarding gameplay. At the moment, however, all those merits are overshadowed by a few critical game design flaws that make you want to quit after dying for the Xth time. I will summarize here the main ones:(Note: I played the game co-op with a friend)1. Pressing ESC does not pause. You think the game is paused but it actually runs in the background. And of course you die within seconds of not paying attention (wolf, heat, food, whatever). Next thing you do is try to find the hidden ""pause"" button and stumble upon the ""sleep"" function in the Shelter. You think ""that's it"" and run to the door to grab the pizza that just arrived. Tough luck mate -in the meantime woke up and died of hunger. Why can't you just add a friggin' PAUSE option there?? Dying is really painful in this game, it shouldn't happen because you get up to pee. Which brings me to the next point:2. Dying is unnecessarily punishing. To sum it up: when you die you a) lose all your ability points (gained through tiresome, repetitive grinding) b) need to rebuild and upgrade your buildings (again more unnecessary grinding) and - worst of all - c) you need to run all the way from the starting area to where you were before without a single protective item or ability (except one piece of candy which does not do much). Did the devs actually test their own game? How are you supposed to wade through hordes of wolves to the other side of the map where your items dropped where you died? The only way to do so is to rebuild on the way while your teammates - no joke - simply wait for you to do so. Which can take 10-15 minutes depending on where you died last! Did the devs forget that this is a co-op game? Where is the fun if you force people to wait doing nothing? (the whole point is that you progress the story together!).3) Related to last point: no markers on the map for players and death areas. If you move a bit faster than your teammates you simply lose them. If you decide to pick up that berry or mushroom, you lose them. If you decide to hunt a deer alone, you lose them. Wtf is that? Why can't you just add a colored marker so that we can find each other? And don't even get me started on finding the place where your items dropped on death...4) There are pitfalls on the map, which are easy to oversee. If you fall into one of those gaping holes, you die immediately, and there is no way to go in there again. Which means say goodbye to all your items forever. Really devs? Is that your definition of game progress? I quit the game immediately when this happened.Summing up: I am more than willing to change my rating as soon as the above is addressed. But I have rage quit the Wild Eight already too many times due to the above and still cannot fathom how you can screw up such a nice game with so obvious errors."

It has one major flaw, and that is there's no way to change your spawn point from the original setting. So after you've spent hours moving through the map and moving your base over and over, you aren't allowed to spawn there. You have to spawn at the beginning and then walk back to where you died from the beginning. Short of that ridiculous oversight, it's a decent game and can be fun. That, along with the fact that you have to move your base about 50 feet at a time so you can manage the animal attacks takes the fun level down a bit."

When playing multiplayer, the game clients become unsynchronized and some players are left unable to pick up any items. There is no reliable method to fix this beyond everyone rebooting their computers. It wouldn't be such a big deal if only happened occasionally, but it happens a lot and sometimes in less than 5 minutes.2). When loading a single player game, there is a black rectangle that covers the screen and input is disabled. This effectively makes saving the game useless since you cannot continue later on.I really want to continue playing and exploring the game, but it is so frustrating to either have to restart every five minutes or lose all of my progress that it just seems futile.Until the devs fix those 2 issue, I cannot possibly recommend this game to anyone. 02-SEP-2017"

It would be fine if you suffered some stat loss on death but to have everything wiped because you got stuck on a rock or a slope you can't move up feels stupid and cheap.Edit: There is an easy mode that was added that fixes the stat and building loss so that is good but they tweaked the food and cold loss to be more forgiving which wasn't really an issue."

There are also side stories/quests that can pop up while you're doing the main one. It's much less ""here are the toys, build a house and go do whatever"" and more like ""here are your tools, build a house but also keep moving forward and solve the mysteries.""I kind of like that better.The soundtrack is such a delight. It's atmospheric and nicely arranged.The ""enemies"" range from typical wildlife to...well...you'll have to play to find out the others.The game is pretty challenging on normal difficulty, where you lose everything on death and start over, but it's nice they added an easy mode, so you don't lose to much, making it a less frustrating if someone wants to explore the later parts of the game."

76561198121330445,Recommended,526160,29977750,Posted: 16 February,all,karaokevox,"This game is brutal.  In order to beat the game you have to die several times in order to save up enough resources to survive the lengths of the map.  I picked Anna as my character because she is a healer.  There is really no advantages in picking a character trait because of the severity of the game; just pick EASY to start off.  Most of the game is famaliarizing yourself with the crafting.  It takes a huge amount of material to craft the simplest things.  What I find the most frustrating about this game is the hunting or lack of hunting capability.  You can kill with your bare hands but you do not get booty.  The only way to get booty is to level up to 3 which will take 3 days at least.   I died on average the 2nd day.  I could kill rabbits and deer but I could not defend Anna from the wolves even with wooden armor!  Fire works on the wolves but is temporary and takes up valuable resources.Animal sinew is necessary to advance in the crafting and rabbits do not provide this valuable commodity!  So be prepared to stockpile rabbit meat and mushrooms to eat for several turns IF you can find them....they are few and far between.Nothing in the game is labeled.  I had no idea what the buildings did nor why they exist.  There is absolutely nothing to read.  I guess the developers wanted to avoid translations.  It is possible to run the entire map if you time your pit stops just right.  The goal is to get to the edge of the map in 2 days.  If that's all you want to do, that's a good enough play through without achieving anything with the story."

So I went there and picked up some things. Then it told me to get the generator and find a place to place it. I took the generator, and went to my camp. Then the next day I looked for the place. It was just a small building next to the tail. After that, I was like, okay I did that then I'm going to go home and work on my camp. But it said to go and see where the powerlines lead, but the issue was that daylight was going way too quick and I couldn't do it in time.I didn't really want to, I wanted to explore the map on my own.

Im not saying its the game its just the game didnt really intice me to want to play it. Quite a few people compare this game to dont starve and the long dark, when I first played dont starve I felt compelled to play it, like I had a need to carry on. in the long dark, i had the same motivated feeling to push on and conquer, this game however didnt do it for me, i would play for a bit and then go play something else.

I refunded this game, as of right now, this game is horrible. Maybe in the future it might be better, but i doubt it, since Early Access titles never leave Early Access.

,Not Recommended,526160,29864956,Posted: 11 February,all,e t h e r e a l,"Another disappointing game. From the screenshots and videos they make it feel as if it's an awesome survival open world game, which I guess you could say it is but those 2 elements are literally all there is.You run through the snow all day poorly trying to kill animals and whatever whilst blindly searching for any sort of buildings (whic are very few and far between) you can go into whilst being certainly killed by wolves (which the game fails to inform you about in the tutorial and they helpfully have a wolf spawn right by the first objective so you have NO way of killing it other than respawning and running back to it and just zerging it down over and over).There is also no way to warm yourself inside most buildings as you cannot place a fire down inside, which when you duck inside the building to take cover from a wolf that half glitches through the wall and you have no way of killing and don't want to run back again and again means you are screwed because you die ridiculously quickly from cold and lack of food.As of today, I have refunded the game, however I hope that they will progress it to the point where I will feel okay to buy it. However, as is the story with most developers that ""decide [they] want to get the community involved and let you support [them]"" which basically, in usually in most cases means: they want your money, but can't be bothered to finish the game (which again, I would like to re-iterate I HOPE HOPE HOPE is NOT the case).Another thing that makes me sceptical is the early access bio.Firstly, ""This does not mean that the game is unplayable or lacks features, it’s actually vice-versa... we have all the core mechanics and features already in the game"" So it's essentially a finished game? But you put it in early access?Secondly, ""Even though we have all the core mechanics and features already in the game, we feel that it can be so much more, but it can become that only with your help.Your participation in Early Access will be crucial to the game’s future, because we will listen to your feedback and improve the game over the time, especially if it fits our vision of the game."" So basically, they have everything they wanted to do in the first place, but they want us to tell them our ideas and will most likely only implement them if it fits their idea of the game? SO WHY DO YOU NEED US TO HELP IF YOU WANT /YOUR/ VISION OF THE GAME?I am also unsure as to whether they put any effort into testing this game at all, as anyone who has played the game will very quickly realise you get stuck into a vicious cycle of: respawn, run to last death (whilst starving/freezing), chop wood for new structures (since when you die your old base gets wiped (I know, fantastic idea right?)), get mauled to death by a wolf that you can't see until it's killing you, repeat.The last thing I did before I refunded that ultimately made be refund was I spawned at morning so it wouldn't get cold too quickly and then I just ran in a straight line to the West. Before I starved to death I found not a SINGLE building. No, not a single one. And yes, I would expect from a game like this to be able to find some sort of actual content and not just more f***ing trees to chop like maybe perhaps even like a little shop with even just some food in or SOMETHING rather than just easily pre-generated terrain.According to others too (although I had not the chance) multiplayer is incredibly terrible and buggy (huh, could have sworn somewhere I read that all the core mechanics and features were already in place somewhere... Oh, right in their EARLY ACCESS BIO).If I see at a later date that this game has /actually/ improved then I will re-purchase it and update my review."

It has alot of problems with it, so im going to go through my story and first impressions of my time on this game...ok so a pro about this game is it looks visually stunning... reminds you of the long dark etc... nice calming soundtrack to make you feel relaxed etc... but the only problem is you are not relaxed!! You are constalty either freezing to death or starving... the metre bars for food and cold etc go down way way too quick! i mean im literally standing at my camp, getting my heat meter bar up and what do you know! my food bar is almost run out! so Im now thinking great! i now need to either go on a little run to get some mushrooms or berries etc or i will die...  so after a run around the forrest I get my food metre bar up to about halfway by finding berries in the bushes and some mushrooms which you have to cook in order to not get food poisining..... But  Im now starting to freeze so i either need to return to my base which is the starting point at the plane or make a little campfire.... So anyway I get my campfire going and my heat metre is now up... But what do you know!! Im getting hungry again! This time Im thinking right enough is enough! I need to stop eating berries and mushrooms because they obvs arent doing a great deal because within under a min of eating them my food bar is pretty much almost empty... so now im thinking right i need to get some meat... by killing an animal.. I start with a boar which is pretty stupid now i think about it, and ofc i die... yay!!... so i respawn and go through the same whole process of making a workshop.. tent and so on! after day 3 when i have some rescources and that.. i decide to try again to get some kind of meat... or anything better than berries or mushrooms.. I see rabbits and im thinking these should be easy enough... I crafted some stones which say these can be used to stun animals.. Now im ready to go out and kill these rabbits and get some meat and see how that does... so after leaving my camp but not far i track down a rabbit... But im also starting to freeze again!! i decide not go back to camp because if i go back and get my heat up my food bar will run out! because remember that bar goes down quicker than anyhting!! I see a rabit and i throw my stone at it... nothing happens apart from a tiny bit of health reduces from the rabbit... but the rabbit sprints away! and if i follow it too long i will be too far awar from my camp and either freeze to death! So now im thinking hmm the stone did not stun the rabbit at all.. all it did was make the ♥♥♥♥er run off! now i have no choice bhut to head back to camp... and hopefully on the way back find mushrooms or somehting to keep my character not dying!I then turned off the game because it seemed to be like some repetative cycle! of running back and forwards!!baseically what i am trying to say is! at the moment the game is too hard for my liking! You seem to be able not to do anyhting that involes exploring because of worry that your health or heat bar will drop! you have no choice but to go back to camp near the plane! and before any of you think why doesnt he just make a campfire and move around the map like that is becasue there are also blizzards in this game which make your campfire burn out within seconds!! so in order to keep that campfire going you need to add wood to it... but chopping wood to add to a fire wastes time and therefore making your heat bar and food bar drop!!I play alot of survival games many of my favourite is the long dark... i play that well and understand it etc... this game is at the moment ridiculously hard... the devs are giving you too many things and not enough time to complete or mange them! food and freezing bar need to not drop so quick!! otherwise you cant do anything!!"

All i did was die because it got dark so fast. What kind of game has day time so short what a joke. Ask for refund did not want to waste money on another game that is broken. The thing is all these games coming out never get finished or when they do they are not that fun or so many other issue that come up.. Maybe game play will change later but a day change from day to night so short is not fun. I have so many games that set their games on heard even on easy the game is heard and you die over and over. The old games had easy difficulty levels that worked and was fun to play. This is no more true in these days, they all but destroyed the fun game play today. Someone going to learn that a game can both be fun and a game that you can learn as you go until then i will not be buying a lot of games until I know for sure how the game works in a demo like the old days. I didn't like the tent as the leveling up weird and the sleep I could not sleep at dark do to no wood, what the F and my sleep time was longer then day light wait and wait for the day light.IF YOUR GOING TO PUT IN A TUTORIAL AND NOT ALLOW THE PERSON TO LEARN IT BEFORE HE DIE'S WHATS THE POINT.

Also the tutorial just tells you what to do but gives you no clue on how to actually do it.  Example, it took me a while to realize you have to use ""F"" to pickup stuff and then right mouse button to use/eat stuff.  I would have expected the tutorial to have at least put up some rudemenitary movement/use key binds to get me going.  I also didn't like the fact that I died within the first 3 minutes of the game because of lack of said instructions.I also found the combat and general gathering hit boxes were not even remotely accurate.Some have asked why I consider having to use Q and E to rotate my view and my simple answer is because of the 200+ games I own on Steam, not one of them uses this method.  The solution would be to simply use holding down the right mouse button and rotating as most other games do.Since so many 0 level people have decided to chime in on my review (I deleted most) I went ahead and added to my critizism."

Now, I have always been one for survival games, especially those that are challenging. Upon reading reviews, watching the videos provided, and doing a little research on some of the playable characters, a few of my friends and I purchased the game.We immediately start up our game together, and decide on our characters, what our roles will be, etc. When I spawned in, I was immediately amazed at the game. The art style surpasses that of beauty, and the gameplay feels similar to that of other games, ex. Diablo. But, it finds its own uniqueness within how it plays. Needless to say, we were sucked in, and our quest for survival had begun...PROS:- A beautiful and unique art style- Large map, for hours of exploration- A unique story that sucks you into your character- A challenging gameplay, that is great for experts, but can be frienly to beginnersCons:- Animals may be placed differently across players applications- Some hits register awkwardly- Some mob drops are unable to be picked up (on rare occasion)Taking into account that this is an early access game, I would have to say it is one of the best survival games I have played to date, and I plan to continue playing it into the futre, and can't wait to see what the developers have in store for us."

And I thought that this was going to be really fun and easy to hop into. I was right about it being fun, but holy mother of baby Jesus, it's not easy. But that's what makes it great! It's a challenge, and it's not so difficult that you want to just quit it altogether. Of course this game is in early alpha, so there will be bugs if you get it within these few months or so. A lot more then if you'd buy it later that is. There's a great skill tree system, no one is stronger then someone else (as in everyone has a nice balance of having thier strengths) and on top of that, it has a great story that is covered underneath the deadly nature. And it's only in the alpha stages of being developed! That's the best part! So there's plenty of room for more content and storylines, and maybe even a workshop where you can make your own stories, maps, and characters, etc. Of course there are a few bugs. Nothing too crazy that I've run into personally, however one annoying bug is when wolves and other hostile animals can walk through CLOSED DOORS. And sometimes animals spawn in roofs and walls and are stuck, although it's funny sometimes, it still takes away from the quality of the game. Not a lot though, I'm positive that it'll be fixed soon.I'd give this game 8.2/10 w/ reccomendation Great game, but still room for more/improvementGreat job to the Devs of the game :D"

Why do we need 20 wood to sleep?  If every player is sleeping, can you make time speed up?If there are changes in place to provide the above mentioned items, I'd gladly recommend this game.** Revised 2/12/17I have seen the dev's really putting their time to improve the game at a really remarkable pace.

The gameplay is fun and enjoyable3. Lots to explore and see and do4. Enjoyable crafting and farming mechanicsCons:1. When you die you lose everything (to include the buildings you built, all your upgrades, your levels and your experience). You start back at zero on every level. The materials you farmed do not re-spawn so you farm everything, use it to build/upgrade buildings and then die and lose the building essentially deleting entire forests every time you die.2. The game is incredibly difficult and you WILL die... a lot. Meaning you will spend hours and hours of your time farming and leveling up to try and have a better chance at survival, only to die 3 hours in and completely erase everything you've done over the last 3 hours.The game (in its current state) is a complete and total time sink. If this were a ""hardcore"" option that would make more sense, but this game is by no means for the casual gamer. It's incredibly difficult and extremely frustrating. Be a badass gamer or find another game.EDIT:The developers have added an easier mode which basically addresses the biggest issue with the game. I have changed my review to a recommend because of it. To the skeptics, dying in the game is not always due to mistakes, sometimes things out of your control get you killed and then you still lose everything."

Then this game is for you!Honestly, the game is pretty good, but the normal game mode is, if you die, you essentially start over.  It's pretty annoying to have to build a fire and eat every 2 minutes.  If the constraints on survival were lessed by a little bit, the game would be much, much more enjoyable.  I dont mind how it is now, if applied to a hardcore mode, but as is, this game isnt for a casual gamer.  I literally spent about 3 hours farming, crafting gear to go out, just to die of starvation because i couldnt find anything in the area I was in, then had to start all over.  I closed the game because I was so frustrated and I doubt I will ever open it again.UPDATE:  As of 2/18 ""easy mode"" has been added to the game, making it much more managable and enjoyable to explore :)"

Fun game to play with ur friends or random ppl. Can be a bit scary while playing alone lol. Losing all ur stuff when u die doesn't bother me at all, it makes u think, plan, and prepare for ur next fight. Highly recommended"

The game is still in early acces so there is bound to be buggs and glitches but other wise i enjoy the game and i hope you do too.

Overall it's still a pretty good game but is very annoying

For those who enjoy ""Simcity"" type games or even other Steam indy die hards, that kill you before you win, like ""Banished"" or ""Don't Starve"", you will surely enjoy this game. With constant updates, custom tailored to reviewers requests this is definitely worth it. Hats off to the development team!"

With many now a days there really isn't much to do but in this there is plenty to keep you entertained with a mysterious plot line that haven't been like many other. The concept of the game is pretty simple which makes it easy and fun to play. This game is incredibly realaxing with the smooth music in the background helps you feel like you're in a winter environment. Fun to play in both Singleplayer and Multiplay.

,Recommended,526160,33234740,Posted: 4 July,all,ThePro-G,"If your a survival genre lover I highly suggest not buying this game for it.  Currently it's more of a story telling game with a bit of monsters that drop loot and some resource gathering to build equipment.I will be reviewing this game as a survival game as this is the reason I bought the game and also the game description.""The Wild Eight is an UNFORGIVING SURVIVAL GAME set in Alaska full of mystery and danger. Explore, hunt and craft shoulder-to-shoulder with friends or random players online. Unless you are brave enough to survive this nightmare on your own?""(*Side note* game is not hard at all, u can survive this ""nightmare"" on your own)Gameplay 8/10Very simple, stun enemy and attack and use traps on stronger enemies.  There is some skill involved in getting used to how to survive (Gathering food, resources and priority upgrades) but other than that it's a very straight forward game anyone can pick up and play.Story6/10So far everything is still up in the air, I expect to change this as more content rolls out, by the story is interesting enough for me to come back in the future.Controls9/10The controls in this game is very very smooth, no bugs, simple click and WASD user input.  I choose to not give it perfect as currently running down a hill makes you fly off and die, this includes stairs.  Intended or not by the dev it requires control to go down a set of stairs that no one would normally do so it makes it harder to use the controls in a way.Content7/10As the game is in beta it's understanable for there to be a lack of content, but I believe there is a lot of simple content that could have been added that the game is lacking. A very simple one would be the ability to build inside the hub as it's very limited in storage space making it pointless to really go out and gather resources.  Which this in turn kills some of the content that is being provided by the game itself.Survival Content3/10Sadly there is not much to the survival content in this game.  You do need food to survive, temperature meter, creatures, resources to gather but as a harsh survival game where your lost somewhere, I expected to be able to find weapon recipes, crafting buildings / benchs, being hunted (waves of creatures), upgrades where it's not only a simple stat upgrade.  This entire game, the only time I felt I was in danger was when I lost control going down a set of stairs and died... at no point of this game I felt that I Was playing a survival game, just more of a storyline game.End game2/10There is a huge lack of end game content as once your finished the side quests and main quest there is nothing left.  Orignally I expected the survival aspect of this game but the content for that is very lacking.  I have finished the game and don't plan on playing it at all until the next... maybe 10 patchs?Overall5.8/10I know the score is very low for me to recommend the game but I totally recommend this game outside of the survival content.  If your planning to buy this game for the survival aspect, DON""T.  You will be very disappointed (As someone who plays heavly modded minecraft, The Forest, Don't Starve, 7 Days to die, Savage Lands).TLDR; Good game, not a good survival game, don't buy if your expecting it to be survival"

,Recommended,526160,33694258,Posted: 21 July,all,Tennybear_c,"Wolves, so many wolves......Almost died after being attacked by a wolf, from there ran straight off a cliff (whoops) where I came across a trusty looking cave, so I went inside to hide and well... died to a mutant man.I wanted something new so when The Wild eight appeared I was drawn to it straight away. Definitely going to keep playing it. It's a little bit tricky but a lot of fun! Easily ended up playing about 5 or 6 hours right after buying it. I feel your hunger bar goes down way too fast but I mean that could change. I really like the look and feel of this game, can't wait to try multiplayer with some friends. Recommended if you like Survival games, especially if you liked Don't starve together. ^_^"
76561198388949096,Recommended,526160,34518490,Posted: 26 August,all,Torpidz,"Singleplayer in this game is pretty much perfected. Myself, i have not experienced any bugs in singleplayer mode whatsoever. The game has decent survival mechanics, with a quest system that explains the situation of the survivor, albeit a bit cheesy, but endurable. Difficulty in the game is well balanced, i find the game to be fine in terms of gameplay, and the constant monitoring of your vitals is just like in any hardcore survival game.Multiplayer, however, is a different story. The game being very client sided, causes players to experience various bugs otherwise hidden in singleplayer mode or in a solo multiplayer world. Bugs range from minor bugs that cause more of a nuisance such as being unable to host servers after saving and exiting a previous world, to more game breaking bugs, such as invisible loot, disappearing chests, and most importantly - client sided issues, other players may cause different items to spawn - invisible trees to completely invisible animals, such as wolves, who would attack you as if you are blind. The only way to fix it is to restart the server, which would cause the aforementioned hosting bugs.But all in all, the game is still in devolopment, especially multiplayer. There are many ways to fix bugs found in mutliplayer, and im sure the devolopers are planning something big to fix most of the issues in multiplayer. Aside from the bugs, this game is a great multiplayer hardcore survival game, combining survival and crafting with adventure: a perfect mixture."

Let me explain.I've played about 10 hours, most of it was prior to the ""explorer"" mode update which is more friendly if you die. Came back to try this after a couple months and got my wife to play multiplayer with me. It is unplayable. She sat next to me and half the time I was running in place on her screen or things that dropped on my screen were not visible or she couldn't pick them up. After exiting and rejoining 5 times I realized it was not worth the hassle to play this game. $20 wasted as she won't play this solo."

I've only played this game for 6 hours straight and still am wanting to come back to it, it is really challenging and time consuming for sure, this is not a game if you want to just sit back and relax, but, If your up for the challenge, this game brings you Excitement and Mystery as you discover new areas and locations, along the way you will build up your character and his/her abilities, and find new creautures along the way, its a thriller adventure as you get further and further away from the crash site, and all I can say is it is 10/10 worth every penny, so stop looking at these reviews and second guessing and have some fun!"
