76561197971467729,Recommended,526240,25433092,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,olympia,This was fun.Things i'd like to see.Longer handle on the pick.A grappling hook in each hand. or combine both in one and give me 2 of them.If you add animals(bad guys etc) the option to hook them and pull them off ledges.An easier way to turn around.  When i got a little disorientated i sat down and played the game over my shoulder cos that was the direction everything was including the menu.Instead of teleport to move how about just allow walk/run.  this could also be used to push off from the wall or swing faster(running start).If the maps get really tall a wing suit would be fun.  Just hold controllers out to the side when you fall so you could fly around the stuff you just climbed.

The first and only level isn't even hard. there is no way to die outside of falling all the way to the bottom. this game has alot of potential but as with most early access titles they are more concerned about creating cool screen shots and videos than actually doing something with their concept. I'm going to keep it for nothing else than I hope it gets better and it is a cool once through for anyone I'm having try the vive.Ways they should improve the game.1. make swappable controllers, it would be nice to be able to pull out two picks and free climb for a better shot sometimes and doing that with the pick and grapple hook is clunky and akward.2. steam workshop and/or a level editing tool. I would think VR would be a natural fit for making your own levels since you can physically move the objects where you need them.3. some kind of danger. enemies, traps, something else to do. The world is not jawdropping beautiful so just climbing gets a little old.P.S. Could not believe how short this game was. even for early access."
,Recommended,526240,26040065,"Posted: 14 October, 2016",all,arleas,"This is a short game with an interesting locomotion method.  First off, imagine how sick you're going to get swinging around like spiderman/tarzan/some ninja with a grappling hook?  Think again... it's not nearly as bad as you think, though you STILL feel the ""Whoa"" movement at times, fast motion sorta obscures the edges of the screen to keep you from hurling.  It works really well.   It might be nice if they allowed you to tailor the effect to how much puke-factor you can take though...So what's the game about other than zipping from rock to rock as they float in midair over British Columbia?  Well, I don't really know... it's sort of an obstacle course but the only obstacles are floating rocks and some gems you can pick up.  There's also some secrets that I have yet to find so there's a little bit of a reason to go back and play through it again (not to mention it tracks your time so you can try to get up to the top even faster)  but really, each game is going to last you somewhere between 10 and 30 minutes depending on how aggressively you try to get to the next waypoint.Things I liked about this game:You get to swing on a rope and pick up gems like the 2600 pitfall guy or somethingThe puke reducing factor is well done so you rarely feel so disoriented that you might fall overyou have another hook that you can use to hold your spot while you pick out a new rock to zip up towardsThere's a certain feeling of satisfaction knowing you got to the top with almost no falls to your deathThings I didn't like:It really doesn't make use of Room scale at all.  You can stand in one spot and make enough hand motions that you never need to walk anywhere at all.At times, trying to climb up a rock to get over a ledge so you can stand on top is a bit awkward feelingThe game is short... My first try I didn't bother trying to get to the top, my 2nd try I did it in 15 minutes.I'm not sure how much those secrets are going to be worth trying to find.  I mean, if it's just ""Ta dah! Secret Area!"" that's boring.  If it's like ""Whoa, whole new secret level!"" that would be awesome.Overall, it's worth trying this game just to see how the locomotion system works and to experience the feeling of swinging through the air but unfortunately the awesomeness wears off fast and you may not want to replay this much. Still worth checking out though.Here's to hoping that more levels get added in the future, and maybe extra climbing tools to make it more intersting."

,Recommended,526240,31675238,Posted: 10 May,all,STEREO,"Meh... This game is . . . alright.  For the price of a cheeseburger, there isn't much to complain about, but there's not much to talk about either, and it gets boring very quickly.  Might be more fun if there was more to do than just collect nonsense artifacts.  I mean, blue diamons... really? Did a box of Lucky Charms help you think of that? No horseshoes or clovers or moons or pots of gold or rainbows, or even red balloons?  Come on, put more thought into what you're attempting to create here.  It could be really cool, or it can just rot and die like so many other VR games, as a quazi-interesting, very short-lived, incomplete minigame."

,Recommended,526240,25423625,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,SupermanScottBristol,"Loved it. My favourite grappling game so far.Only about 30 mins play time but no complaints for the price.Some of the mechanics need a little work (some times facing a flat ledge with your hook attached the reeling in doesn't pull you up and over) but really that's a minor point and the only negative.Upgrades like multiple hooks would be cool, the ability to swing yourself too.Looking forward to more levels, ones which force you to look down and appreciate your height, make you feel more precarious etc."
,Recommended,526240,25416047,"Posted: 8 September, 2016",all,Darth Pravus,Great swinging mechanics but I wish you could have two picks sometimes as the grapple gun is hard to climb on things with. Looking forward to more content.
,Recommended,526240,25414207,"Posted: 8 September, 2016",all,Doc Halliday,This game is fantastic - I got some unique feelings when falling 40 stories down.  Great job on developing an entertaining and simple game.Please keep working on the swing physics and collisions with walls.  This game is a blast to play.
,Recommended,526240,25462719,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,GamingWiggler,I got this game for a bit of fun for the channel. I really enjoyed it! swinging around from rock to rock with a grappling hook. Trying to get all the crystals as i went along until i got to the top. I hope more challenge modes will come out for the game in the future!

First time 15 mins , second 18 mins. Got all the shards but didn't find the hidden secrets, so will go back and replay. I really liked the mechanics of the gun sling and the rock pick to climb or hang on for dear life.Seems like the devs are active, so really look forward to the updates."
76561198003292839,Not Recommended,526240,25515827,"Posted: 15 September, 2016",all,FLKttn,"Really thought I would like this, as it looked like a more vertical ""mountain climber version"" ofWindlands. There's just too many small annoyances with it though.The aim of the grappling gun feels way, way, waaay off.You can't really control your line using your own body (yank on the rope to control your momentum or similar) so it never feels natural.Having to hold the trigger while reeling is clunky.Only one rope means there's no good way to change the momentum of your swings when hooked,and so on. In addition to that, constantly having your nose pressed up close to some very rudimentary textures doesn't help things at all.In short, it's just cumbersome to play and not very pretty either.To be blunt, I'd rather play the cloud-track onGrapplyfifty times than fight the controls onCloudBoundany longer.As for theirDynamic FOV, it just seemed to black out the sides of the display when I reached a certain speed. As far as VR sickness is concerned, it's so subjective that it's near impossible to judge on someone else's behalf. If it helps others, then that's great. I didn't see much benefit to it."

Only complaint I have is the length, might just be Windlands has ruined short experiences for me but I got 100% completion rate on this on first playthrough in 14 minutes.Looking forward to seeing where the game goes from here throughout Early Access :)"
76561197967369063,Recommended,526240,26416806,"Posted: 4 November, 2016",all,Chieftom,Short but sweet. Once I realised I could climb arm over arm using the pickaxe and hook I almost prefered that to the swinging! (Although the swining was also fun). Well worth the price

,Recommended,526240,26467434,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,Braedon,"In Cloudbound your object is to make it to the top swinging between rocks like Spiderman with your grappling hook and its absolutely amazing. Definitely my top 5 favourite VR games to date, the locomotion with the grappling hook is realistic and handles the blur from moving fast very well. I have never felt nauseous or light headed playing this game."

I didn't know until I was almost at the top that you need to click *before* you try to claw on, rather that at the same time. Also it's frustrating that the game seems to direct you left at the start to a portion that's too far to scale (?) I gave up first time before realising that you can even go right, becuase I thought I just wans't getting the hang of it... Only by chance did I give it another go and tried going right."

I would highly recommend it, it really feels like you are flying.Be careful you don't fall over while or after you play, it can make you a little dizzy. Only con really is that the game doesn't take that long to complete.(It would also be nice if there were a way to run off the cliffs, and if there were a way to rotate your view without physically rotating)"
,Not Recommended,526240,29459217,Posted: 24 January,all,TheNarwhal,"A few things about this game. It's not a particularly new idea. It doesn't look beautiful. It's DFOV system is not optional, and there simply is no pause menu to edit settings. After playing this, you may have this strange sense that you just paid about $6 for a demo. This is normal, when you've paid $6 for a demo. You may also notice you're really not enjoying yourself if you were hoping for a really exciting VR experience.My biggest issue with this game is how slow everything is. I get that it's to cater to those prone to motion sickness, but it really kinda dampens the whole experience for others. Especially since there's no settings to change how that all works.My last thought is on the secrets. I feel like the 3 hidden bits around the map were placed to make it so completionists waste their time trying to find those before getting bored and refunding the game."
