Like playing Call of Duty-Fun for 30 minutes at leastCons:-Inconsistent tank physics-Weapons feel weak-If Im in a tank why can I be stopped by things that wouldnt even stop a small car?  Why even make a tank game if it cant act like a tank?-Lack of challenge or strategy-No real way of avoiding enemy attacks-Bad level design

,Recommended,526250,25675979,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,Jblade35,"This game gets some things right and other things wrong - I'm gonna give it a thumbs up as I think there's potential here.First off, when I click 'play' the game literally launches in seconds, and then I can pick a level straight away. That might seem  minor but for a quick action game it's invaluable. The few ship levels can be skipped (at least the first two) which is a good gesture since they're on rails. The levels are relatively fun, and seem to have a lot of big UFOs blowing stuff up in the background. It's a pretty cheesy bay-style movie but sometimes you just want that.The game does have a few problems; weapon impact in general need some work since enemies just take damage and then explode in a pretty weak way. The game is inconsistent in what you can run down in the Tank and what you can't - this is a problem as part of the fun of being a tank is crushing stuff. The first few levels are generous but then the later few I've played so far has me being blocked by minor things. So far I'm stuck on a level where I have to drive through warehouses with my tank being stopped by thin metal shelving.I think the developer should focus on making this a very fast-paced game where you just hold forward and carve a path throughout the level, as it stands the combat isn't satisfying enough to make me want to sit in one place and have a protracted battle.I had much more fun when I was driving at full speed crushing obstacles and firing at enemies whilst I flew by them. Some more differences in the weapons would be good as well; I'd suggest having the machinegun fired seperately from the other weapons. Taking damage feels forced, especially in tight quarters where enemies spawn in front of you and you can't avoid them...there should be more ways to gain health back rather than the rare reinforcement pads I've seen."

The audio is terrible and would seriously befefit from a subtitles option at the very least, or distinct volume sliders for the voice and BGM, most of the time you only have the vaguest idea of your objective because you can't make out what's being said to you.The second level on the back of the aircraft is literally the most tedious thing I've ever played. Making it skippable was a wise move, but seriously; it needs to be at least half as long as it is now. If this had been early access and would be worked on further  I would have said it held a fair bit of promise, and been a little more forgiving. Clearly Alexey Glinskiy has put a lot of effort into this, but as it is currently it needs a fair bit of work it doesn't look like it's going to get. That's a shame. Not so much a rough diamond as still a piece of coal. Not for me!"
,Recommended,526250,25638630,"Posted: 22 September, 2016",all,I See Starz,"This a game in it's own nature and I enjoy it. So far I played one mission and then went for about 54 waves and just said F it to see what happens when the timer ends. The controls on the 360 controller work good, though you can't invert the Y setting which is always a slap to my face but at least it had controller support none the less. The graphics are like a mix actually I felt a bit of the similar engine that Warshift was using and if you use a AMD processor I can see it tank and go south fast but I have a I3 6320 and got 60+ FPS with a GTX 1060 at the highest 1080p setting. There were times when it fell when it would respawn a new enemy base but I can see that get fixed later on. The voice acting is a low budget but I feel this is a indie style so it is ok and expected. The gameplay is very fluid and I loved the weapons so far I was able to use a minigun and a homing rocket and a cannon along with close quarter flamethrower.I love tanks and the one you use looks very cool and you can change the paint on it as well. The sounds for the base game are nice and all in all I would like to see where this title goes and how the updates effect it. I won't lie it is buggy but not game breaking buggy. At times the enemy crawlers would just be stuck in building walls or in the air and no they are not flying lol but walking on air.I recommend this to casual gammers that want to jump into action and don't care for a story and enjoy arcade indie gameplay. I enjoyed this and I give it a 10/10"

Ever since Battle LA I've been hankering for some military V.S. aliens action.The environment in the first couple levels (as far as I've gotten and will get) is amazing.  Especially the second level, seeing an air battle against alien ships including an Independence Day-like mothership and alien walkers roaming around on the ground.The trouble is that the gameplay is bad.  Aiming doesn't particularly work, especially in that second level.  All your projectile weapons have a very slow travel speed and the same kind of aliens just spawn out of nowhere all the time.This is a good effort for what seems like a single guy studio, but the best art and environments just don't salvage the gameplay.  I'd love to see what this game is like in another year and a few more devs thrown at it."

,Not Recommended,526250,29476843,Posted: 24 January,all,Cosmonaut,"This game was bad. Reeeeeeally bad.I though, ""Oh cool, an arcadey tank game, I'll jump right on that!"". I got in, and was presented with a short intro cutscene with possibly the worst voice acting I have ever heard.Okay, you might think they're trying to go fo a B-movie vibe with that, right? No. The game gets worse as you gain control of the tank. The controls are clunky (The game can't seem to figure out what was an input for turn and what was an input for forward). The enemies look like they're ripped straight out of the new war of the worlds.On top of all of this, the game throws you into a boss fight at the end of the first mission with no explaination of what is going on or what you're supposed to do. I spent a good fifteen minutes wandering around the boss arena trying to figure out what I was supposed to do, as the boss had exactly zero reaction to being shot at.The final straw was being thrown into a rail shooter section in the second mission, where you're supposed to shoot down alien fighters while tied to some sort of transport. Only all of your weapons suck for this kind of combat due to the massive lead required to hit with even the machne gun. The tank cannon was an absolute joke in this mode, as I was hardly able to aim it while the camera jerked around and jostled my aim. The missiles were just as useless in this scenario, as it felt lik there was a 50% chance of them just ignoring your target completely and doing nothing.TL;DR This game was bad enough that I asked for a refund of the $1.75 I spent on it during the winter sale. Buy at your own risk.(Edits for spelling and clarification.)"
