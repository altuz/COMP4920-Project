But as usual the story is well told and the information revealed here is critical to starting to understand the plot of the series as a whole. This ends the Question Arcs and starting with Chapter 5, it's time to start getting some answers. There's still a lot of wonderful time to spend in Hinamizawa."

There’s different main characters since this story happens before the 3 first chapters. It’s about Rika “Nipah~☆” Furude and a rookie police investigator this time, and it reveals even more mysteries about Hinamizawa. As usual, a great horror/mystery kinetic (or sound) novel by 07th Expansion.Hopefully the Answer Arc will be released soon!∞/10."
,Recommended,526490,29298937,Posted: 16 January,all,h0tsp4ce,"If you've come this far - there is no turning back. Himatsubushi is a ""Bonus"" chapter of the Question Arc. Centered upon my personal favorite character, Furude Rika, the reader is taken back to a time before the previous three chapters. Knowledge is gained (or perhaps just confusion) regarding the Three Families of Hinamizawa by a young public official sent from Tokyo to investigate an incident. Ooishi-san is very present as well as he assists (and laughs along) with the green detective.Absolutely play through this if you enjoyed the previous chapters of Higurashi: When They Cry. Support 07th Expansion. Seriously. We need more chapters!Yes, my only 'con' here is that it was short. This can be forgiven as it was a 'bonus' and I don't believe the length detracts from the overall added content it provides to the series. Now, let's all make our charms and hang them up in an attempt for an expedient release of the next chapter. Nipah! ^-^"

It starts off promising, but ends up being very disappointing. Some much needed development for the character Rika and the supplementary Tips save it from being considered outright bad.ConclusionCh. 4 could be considered a side story to the previous three chapters. Told from the point of view of a new character, this story serves as both a prequel to the series for the majority of its length and as a brief sequel to Ch. 3's scenario in its finale. It's probably the weakest chapter up to now, but it does a nice job showcasing a little more of the village's power structure as well as providing a few more clues as to what exactly happened towards the end of Ch. 3.Novel length is roughly5 hoursdepending on reading speed. It is about half the length of previous chapters. It's best tobuy Higurashi Ch. 4 when it's on saleonly after having completed the previous three chapters. Staving off a purchase in hopes of a deal is fine even if there's worry about forgetting details from the previous chapters if not read immediately. The story will work better as a transition piece before beginning the upcoming Answer Arc."

,Recommended,526490,26410263,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,Yureina,"Himatsubushi is the shortest of the Higurashi arcs, and yet has some pretty important details in it for figuring out what's really going on. It is also the last of the ""Question arcs"", so with this and the previous 3 Arcs, you have all the ""clues"". You also get a taste of things to come since you have an entirely different protagonist and setting for this Arc, which becomes the norm from this point onwards. While this story may be fairly short, it is filled with stuff you should keep in mind as you get into the later arcs as the mystery unravels.And... that's really all I can say. This is probably my least favorite arc, but I still like it. Besides, it being on Steam serves as a reminder that my favorite storyline, Meakashi-hen, is right around the corner. Can't wait. :DGo back to Tokyo."

,Recommended,526490,26126611,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,MindfulOcean,"I enjoyed reading this chapter and I recommend it if you are a fan of the series.  If you haven't read any of the others, I would recommend you go in order and read this one last.Chapter 4 changes up the series formula in that it is told from the perspective of a different character and takes place several years before the main story.  While it was nice to see this chapter do something different, I found myself unable to connect with the main character.  Each of the previous chapters featured one of the main girls as a focus, and this time the spotlight was on Rika.  I feel that by changing the formula it made it harder for Rika to shine in the same way that the other girls did in their individual arcs (though that might have been necessary to conceal crucial plot details--time will tell)."
,Recommended,526490,26437393,"Posted: 5 November, 2016",all,[Hex] RottenB,"Okay, don't blame me, but this is the first Review I'm writing about this masterpiece-series you're looking at.I wrote a more or less good Comment for the second francise ""Umineko"" but I never did for the first Three Chapters of Higurashi even though I'm a huge fan of this series.Now after this out the way let me start the real Review of this Chapter of Higurashi.The Review:Higurashi no Naku Koro ni  (or in english ""When The Cicadas Cry"") Is a Franchise built by ""ryukushii07"" and contains around ten~ish Sound Novels which kept to themselves give a mystery which can be solved byfindingreading all the clues throughout all games. Therefor this Series of Sound Novels isn't the traditional Video Game you might think but rather a mind game you'll need to solve outside the games boundaries.This might shock some players, but I can guarantee that lovers of mystery/horror novels WILL like this series as the main plot drives around a murder series that takes place before the story beginns as well as during it.As this is the fourth novel of the series I might as well add at this point that the first three stories should have been read before this though only one of those is really essential to understand more or less what's going on, but because we all want to solve every riddle that's handed upon us, all three are needed to disentangle the whole mystery(WARNING!!!All novels, even the ones still unreleased on steam are needed to solve everything that haunts the city of Hinamizawa! Please do not criticize the point that you can't solve the mystery at this point. You aren't supposed to solve it at this point!!  Thanks for your understanding!)So yeah, storywise I can't really tell anything as I would spoil the whole fun out it if I only dare to talk about the first parts of this Chapter, as (even though this Chapter has only half the lenght than the others) it also doesn't start with the action rightaway...So let's finish up what I'm writing here ASAP as it's getting waaaay otherlenght I think...TL;DR:If you loved/liked the other three entries in the Higurashi-Series, this is for you.If you love/like good mysteries and mind games, this is for you.If you love/like good written stories which immerse you into the story, this. is. for. you.On the other hand:If you hate reading, this isn't for you.If you hate thinking and/or mysteries, this isn't for you.If you despise the Horror-Genre this definitely isn't for you.If you didn't like the other Higurashi Chapters, this. isn't. for. you.I hope I could help a bit so yeah ^^Hope you all have a good day and I could help at least some of you if you should buy the novel or not.Oh, and almost forgot, yeah there were some typos here and there (quite a few in comparison to the other chapters) though I hope MangaGamer will keep up like with the other chapters and give some fixes here and there."

If you're unfamiliar with visual novels or with the series, you may actually want to start here and then go back to Chapter 1.Everyone else, well, buckle in.  At its heart it's just as batshit insane (in a good way) as the first three, but this is told slightly differently and with a much more realistic tone.  Right up until the major groin-kick at the end, of course.  You might think this is a recommendation or not.  In any case, if you liked the last three, it's more of the same."

Which probably correspond to the second season of the anime.For those who are just starting with this serie, theoretically u could start with this one and turn back to ch. 1 afterwardsThis time u experience the story through a police man who just got into Hinamizawa for work. It is the time before Keichi moved to this village, meaning it's the time when there was the so-called ''Hinamizawa Dam-war'' which had important influences on the future (ch.1-3.)In fact u don't exactly HAVE to read this one bc it isn't exactly a part of the Question Arc, but I would totally recommend it. Otherwise u'll miss very very important aspects of the story and u won't be able to classify when what where happend.It's more than worth it for everyone who adores higurashi or likes creepy stuff - like always."

Also Rika will be the star of Himatsubushi.Despite this chapter being short some things were brought up that make u think about them. In particular during the end where it's said to find out the truth of what really happened in the last parts of chapter three. Yup that means there are more questions being raised.Also Maebara is not the star of Himatsubushi. U will be playing as a character called Akasaka. In my opinion it was interesting to play as someone else as u get a different point of view in the story.Next chapter which comes out in a few days is going to start the answer arcs.

It's more like a conventional mystery story, complete with detective protagonist, set the year before the dam murder incident.I actually appreciated the change of pace in this side story. It felt almost like a rest. The new protagonist was sympathetic, and I really enjoyed the plot, and the insights into the power structure of Himazawa. It made me tense, and it made me cry. It also was better paced.If you've got this far, you're probably an addict already, though, and will read this no matter the reviews. :)And now for the Answer arcs...

Well there are a couple of key reasons; namely if Ch.3 is the most perfected cycle of the similar structure in the previous 3 chapters, then Ch.4 is the most coolest way in conveying Higurashi's mystery right before it starts becoming solved in Ch.5.With this chapter, you're a undercover cop investigating a kidnapping case that is filled with political tension surrounding a Japanese government official. Just know that this story really helps you get an idea of what the answer to the mystery is and gives great context to what will occur in the future of these tales. Without heading into spoiler territory, it brushes on certain aspects of the village that are impossible to understand from an inside perspective- Namely, the uncanniness of a village like Hinamizawa.I absolutely love this one, no questions asked, and I think it really gives certain characters deserved spotlight. Finally rounding out the cast into individual favorites.My only complaint is the price doesn't coinside with the length. 5 dollars for 4 hours is a bit much- in comparison to the other chapters 10+ hours and 7 dollars.Get ready and strap in as this side story directly helps bridge the mysteries into answers!"
