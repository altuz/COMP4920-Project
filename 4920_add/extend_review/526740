Honestly the fact that at the time of writing this has 376 reviews and it's concidered Very Positive"" astounds me. Actually no, i find it down right suspect.To call the interface cluncky would be unfair to clunky interfaces, you cant have more than 1 window open at once, you cant copy paste anything, so your constantly having to remember urls to copy from one window into another, or your sitting there with notepad open in a seperate window typing it in there so you dont have to worry about remember it incorrectly. This game has nothing even close to hacking other than 'heres a bunch of programs, go run them against this target'.This game could be somewhat good if they bothered to at least TRY to emulate a decent OS enviroment but they havent even bothered to do that. Which at this early stage, i dont have high hopes for as its clear they havent actually tried to play or get someone to play their own game and give them feedback before releasing it on steam.Give this one a miss, there are plenty other hacking themed games out there that are a lot more realistic, not that it takes much."

It's basically just a point and click picture adventure, there's no real skill involved.The fact that you can't emulate a proper windows environment really does it in.  Have details on a supposed password?  Hope you brought a pen and paper, because the emulated environment doesn't allow you to resize the windows and keep that nugget of information on screen.The narrator would be better served if they pretended it was a skype session of sorts and you were sharing your screen.Just a magical window showing up (from a so-called hacker), that you can't bring back up once you dismiss it, doesn't help.If the hacker was that capable they could do the work themselves (or better yet, program a bot to do the work for them.)"

I couldnt make any progress.It IS Early acces, but for me it makes no difference, as almost every f*cking game is Early Acces. When am i ever going to see a full, complete game on Steam again? Sigh. There should be a bottomline on how far the game should be developed before even going Early Acces. Such a shame. If i could have just played this game from end to finish i wouldnt be moaning right now BUT I SIMPLY CANNOT. Would have been a great experience. Requested refund. Never gonna buy again. For everyone thinking to buy this game, just wait for a year or 2 until it enters beta or even release, cuz for early acces there just isnt a lot as what the game's direction is. It fundamentally is a small, small game. Dislike this review all you want but im just being honest about this game."

,Not Recommended,526740,30616275,Posted: 19 March,all,Vic=HKC=,"Given the discount, I've bought this little game where you're an hacker, trying to take down big corporations. No, I'm kidding, in reality, you're just doing stuff to please others without real plot, even if there is a try at it.It's hard to say that some missions are just reading mail and nothing else (you can see that when you're selecting chapters). Seriously, while I understand the need to divide the game in episodes for the weak plot, it would be great to have divided chapters in real ones.There is also a major bug in the first mission for people with AZERTY keyboards: the backslash (\) and the colon (:) aren't working.... well, to be more accurate, it's mapped without any sense (due to the engine apparently). I found the corresponding keys: SHIFT + $ for : and µ for \.Anyway, while it's kinda enjoying using available tools, there is also a major flaw: the fact that you need to touch a key for the game to write ""virus"" or ""chat answers"". One by one. So, if it's was short stuff, it's not annoying but you have one long part and after that, it's tricky to exit.While the graphics aren't bad, you're just in a virtualized Windows. The music was perhaps the strongest point of the game, even if it's the same track, but well, I enjoyed it.And well, should I mention that sometimes, selecting a chapter will end up in black screen or deformed screens?hack_me is void of options. It could have been a good game if only more efforts were put for the plot and for varying missions. People complained about Hacker Evolution, yet, Hacker Evolution was much versed into a real challenge than hack_me.True, hack_me with a 80% discount is perhaps a good deal, after all, there are wallpapers AND trading cards AND achievements. But for the full price, it's just a game you should avoid. In other words, while I've enjoyed some parts of it, I can't really recommend it. I will probably buy hack_me 2 but not at full price."

So, you basically just mash your keyboard randomly to ""type"" out anything in the game. I understand that you aren't allowed to type anything invalid, but there is a better approach to this.+ there are many many bugged parts (must be due to Early Access).E.g. sometimes when the player faces the request in the email, declining that request would send them onto the next chapter rather than progressing the game with that choice.+ The music seems okay at first, but gets boring and tiring to hear pretty quickly. (And there aren't any options to mute the music)Not to mention how the music play-back is bugged if you return to the main menu and pick a different chapter or start a new game, the music might be played twice at the same time (I almost got a headache from that)Better yet, there aren't even options to change the game from fullscreen -> windowed -> windowed full, etc.= Suggestions  (other than fixing the persisting bugs) =+ There should be a setting menu to change the music/ sfx volume, languague, screen resolution, everything.For the typing mechanism:+ Letting the player know what they're supposed to type could be an approach.There could be a block of faded text showing what's supposed to be there. The player can type anything they want, as well as being able to use function keys like Ctrl, Shift, Enter, Delete, etc.BUT,  the game would only advance if everything was typed correctly, else alert the player with a text box or something like ""Oops, something isn't right."".For customization:+ The current wallpapers are a-okay, tho. I have nothing against them. But if the player can change the wallpaper, that'd be awesome.+ There should be an option to choose or play your custom music, like, REAL sound files in your system (kinda like an option to import / locate the music folder in your computer).In short, since this is game is gonna be a simulation, it'd be amazing if the player felt like they're hacking with their own OS other than just playing a game.Welp, that's it for now. Loads of issues.But don't get me wrong, tho. This game seems nice and I trust that it'd turn out to be awesome.Just, wait until it's fully developed."

The tutorial is terrible, and you're not really doing anything, just following instructions and typing in commands that the game gives you (that you can't see again because once you close the tutorial window they're gone for good.)The aforementioned commands don't even have any footing in reality, either. You connect to other systems using a 'connect' command, which obviously isn't how things work outside of Source games. You can't do ls/dir in order to get any information about the directory you're in. You can't do cd, you just type in full file paths. File paths that are completely arbitrary, as the directories leading up to them don't exist. The game has made no attempt to emulate a window manager, and no attempt to base itself in even a vaguely realistic terminal setting.Seriously, cd, dir, and a directory structure of some form should at least exist before you try and call yourself a hacking simulator. Even games like Uplink, a TERRIBLY (and deliberately, to be fair) inaccurate hacking simulator had these things.Don't waste your time."

It's impossible for me to type : for instance, and the symbols / and \ are not the same as the physical keyboard. Which makes it impossible for me to type ""D:/Documents/Bank/logpass.txt"" and go on with the story.Also it simulates a Windows XP envoiroment, but you can't move the windows around the screen, so basically you have to Alt-Tab the game and make notes on notepad about the thing you have to do, or memorize everything.

Uplink isn't, and lets you carry it on however you want, though it is not story-less. This game has a terrible UI in which you can't open up more than one window, Uplink has one of the best UIs I've seen to date, allowing you to have multiple windows open at once, and place things on screen as you wish.Now, if you say ""Well it's just an Early Access Game"" Well in the face of Uplink (made by 2 or 3 people) this game satnds no chance which is why I've gotta give it a thumbs down because for a small increase you can have a massive increase in quality.

The game features a story full of experience as a hacker, and it is really comfortable playing. Although there was a bug/glitch i really didn't enjoy. On some missions, Elena tells you to do something and shows you some kind of exact text of what you need to do. If you missed it or clicked away for some reason, then its hard to find out what to do unless you find a walkthrough or restart the mission/level. But if I were to look away from all bugs, spellings, and all that kind of stuff, This game should get an award. And this is not irony, because even tho its not a beutiful graphic fps game, it does blow your mind how intresting it is. Would be awesome if it came in even more languages, which might come in the 2nd game (I hope). I really recommend this game for anybody that likes the kind of illegal games (hacking etc.).

,Not Recommended,526740,30605457,Posted: 18 March,all,Spirit_OK,"DO NOT BUY. The so called game is a bunch of scripted tasks in pseudo-windows environment that is neither fun nor educative, and looks like hastily slapped together mspaint drawings. Usability issues start to boggle you since the very start of the tutorial - it tells you to input an IP-address that is nowhere to be found after you close the tutorial memo. It was the bloody game restart for me just to reread the tutorial and write down the address with pen and paper!Then, the plot is non-existent, the icons and buttons are really small and unresponsive, the interface is lame altogether. I played like 11 minutes and decided that it would be my first refund, despite grabbing this ""game"" at 80% discount. That's really THAT bad."

The game (in the task where you have to enter 'D:\something\something\something') does not recognise the backslash or '\' button as with some other buttons (that were unnecessary throughout my gameplay) but still, they weren't recognised.I will list some pros and cons as well:Pros:+it's an interesting concept+above average sound, gives that hacking/csi-ish feelingCons:-as I said, game does not recognise some buttons which are key (pun intended) to play the game-the Windows 10 artstyle does not fully cut it for me-which hacker would only have 2-3 applications on their computer's desktop?-can't minimize windows, only close themOverall, I'm filing a refund of my 79 cents, maybe I'll buy it later on if I get a different pc."

You are literally pressing any keys (like they do it in the movies) blindly to hack someone's computer. Funny indeed, but doesn't really fall into the 'simulation' category at all. Also the game basically guides you onto the next objectives, further oversimplifying the gameplay.OK for casual gamers wishing to dive into the 'hacking' theme, but for those who are looking for some hardcore experience and puzzles -- keep looking."

I dont like that I cant use capital letters, I cannot move the screen around at all, it doesnt function like a windows computer, thus I think it should all be in terminal. Anyone who is used to a windows display will get frustrated cause they cant use it exactly like a windows display. I like the art, it has the Mr.Robot feel but needs more polish and less read this and type that. Make it for people who actually like hacking. I can't recommend this game as it is because i don't like the linear direction its taking. Where do you do nmap scans? Anyways I know its in developement, just my opinions.

The creators are displaying the empathy level of a rock and there is no love of detail. Immersion is almost non existent. It'd have been relatively easy to introduce the game's concepts in a much cleverer way and to improve the GUI. Noone is expecting fancy graphics in such a title, a hacking game should be, by default, about something else. In the current state it's crap. I'd be interested in the concept though if a clone would comes out which would be created with the proper love such a project deserves."

The second hack you have to code takes two literal minutes of solid key mashing and worst yet you can't hold down a key to code quickly.
