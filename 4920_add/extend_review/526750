,Not Recommended,526750,31387103,Posted: 26 April,all,byteframe,"I hate to give this a negative rating, because of the higher quality of the sequels. Reduction in price by a dollar, or a quality polish, or a small extension might make it more desirable. It's very harsh on the eyes, at least with that initial strobe light. The sound is also abrasive. The puzzles weren't bad, and I love having to duck/crawl and having the evil walls change on you. Yet, just as it seems to get good, it's over. If you just bought energy drinks and a $20 steam card at the drugstore, and you're on the prowl for escape room games, get the cabin sequel.A gem for a indie bundle, though.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=891488564"

I also lost my flashlight when it fell through the floor and departed from the universe. Still, I will wait for the bug fixes beacuse this game is edgy as♥♥♥♥♥♥and I'm a sucker for escape games."
,Recommended,526750,30250147,Posted: 28 February,all,Handerre,"This game is REALLY short! Steam tells me I’ve been playing for 13 minutes and that’s how long it took me to finish the game. And I even had to restart once since my flashlight got lost (glitched outside of the play area).During my short gameplay I experienced a couple of jumpscares, claustrophobic moments, and some pretty basic puzzles. And it was delivered with an excellent use of roomscale. I loved it!I do not recommend buying this for the full price of 4 dollars. However, if you’re buying The Cabin (a much better game from the same developer) you’ll get this one pretty cheap in the bundle."
,Not Recommended,526750,26078327,"Posted: 16 October, 2016",all,Prosfis,"In short, the game neither satisfied my craving for puzzles nor horror.The game was too short and there really was not much of a puzzle to solve. There was nothing clever about it as it was just a mini treasure hunt for keys which were placed in plain sight. I would have finished in about 5-10 minutes if it wasn't for recurring bugs that led to me having to restart the game every time.The horror element to the game is pretty cheap. Just a 3D model that pops up with a loud sound, a flickering light, and themed music.The only good thing I have to say about this is the devs are active and have fixed one bug that was causing me problems, and will probably fix the other bugs that damaged my experience."

It's a bit on the short side, but a good experience for the price in the bundle with Cabin.It has an interesting mechanism for use of smaller spaces"

The only positive that I can think of is that you have to crawl through a tunnel, wich was fun. I would wait for a massive deal, like 75% to be worth it."
76561197970409387,Recommended,526750,29715752,Posted: 5 February,all,Zaesch,"Sometimes creepy.The playtime is short.The riddles are solvable.It is great to see the person in VR if it crouches around on the ground :-DFor spectators the screen mirror is a bit too dark (sometimes you can't see things, that the person in VR can see clearly).There are much glitches and it happened two times that something you need got lost, if you are not very careful with taking it and laying it down. The only solution was to restart the game. ""The cabin"" works better."

VR ""games"" is in it's infancy, it's at the very early stages of development, we gamers are its test subjects. Keep up the good work devs, read the reviews, take on board gamers comments, ignore the criticism (some jerks just love the sound of their own bleating""."

It was 50% off but doesnt compare well to similar demos which are free.As one reviewer says, the use of space is good, but with clipping the hidden places are not too hidden.Jump scares are also a bit tame/lame."

I am becoming a huge fan of room escape games in VR, but this feels very much like a quickly put together student project.  That being said, the next game from this developer (The Cabin) is a big step up from this one, so it appears that they are learning as they go."
,Not Recommended,526750,31248772,Posted: 19 April,all,pr1mary_c1l1um,"The entire thing is solved just by looking around in a small space - no real puzzles here. I also had some performance issues. Plenty of better escape rooms out there so don't waste your money.It is quite creepy, if you like that sort of thing. I found the flickering lights to be very annoying."
