,Recommended,527160,25775457,"Posted: 29 September, 2016",all,REPresenh,"Holy smoke, this IS THE BEST movie app I ever used, period!!! And I used many of them...I tried BigScreen, Simple VR Player, Whirligig, Cineveo, Oculus Cinema. This is BAR NONE, the best movie app for VIVE!!  Why? Because I said so!!  Here's the thing, Oculus Cinema is good but Cmoar takes it further and allow you to change the seat, that's HUGE.  You get 4 different environments (and i hope there are more).  You get a Home Theater, Movie Theater (biggest one), the VOID and an environment where you sit on a boat.  You can change the seat up to 3 positions in two of the four environments.  I always choose the closest seat. The thing that makes it great is the UI and the ease of use.  FINALLY someone listen and show videos in thumbnails!! None of the video apps i used before show videos in thumbnails (with the exception of Oculus Cinema), they simply display them in file names and that's not appealing to me.  This app allow you to scroll through the videos with the trackpad and change to different menus with a click of a button making it very user friendly.  This is exactly what I wanted and how to integrate the UI into a movie app.  I like how you can ""favorite"" your videos.  I think this is a GREAT feature because you don't have to go around and looking for the videos that you want to watch, everything you want is stored in the ""favorite."" You can even ""favorite"" Youtube videos.  Here's the positives so far:1. Home Theater - Nice realistic environment up close look very details.  I prefer this over Oculus Home Theater because     this is a little closer to the screen.2. Movie Theater - Better than Oculus Cinema because again, you can change seat and i feel you can get closer.  The environment is darker and lighting is nice.3. Boat Theater - This is the least of my favorite I think because I can't get close enough...I want to get closer.  The water doesn't seem as real?  I wish it cast reflections like Cineveo? Water should be clear (not too blue) giving it a sense of depth. I like to see what's below the water.4. Void Theater - Nice size and you can resize it but it's a bit tricky, it needs to fine-tune.  But it is as good as any Void theater.5. I was able to supersampling at 2.5 with no problem...no slow down and stuttering in any of the environments...this is amazing with 980ti.Like any app, there is always the shortcomings and here's something it needs to improve:1. Movie Theater - I feel like I want to get EVEN closer, I want the size to be miximized like the maximum size of the VOID theater. I haven't seen a theater that does this....it doesn't bother me because if i can watch the VOID in max size with no problem, i should be able to do the same on the big Movie Theater environment.2. I feel all the movies are a bit dark, there should be an option for brightness, contrast, ect. adjustments.3. I feel like the Vive's left trackpad should be used for changing seats...pressing up to move up and down to move down will make thing easier.  I also feel that the right trackpad should be used to bring up the movie time status and with the left and right to skip forward and backward.4. Add volume and supersampling option would be cool.5. Add the ability to remember your folder or maybe ""favorite folder""?6. Add a nomirror option.7. Add Netflix and Amazon videos (I know no video apps can pull this off).8. Use your Vive's cam as a webcam to view what's outside? Like they did in Cineveo?"

Just to be clear since I wasn't, it does support MKV files, the 3D movie stuff is the best solution I've seen so far - so if you got a 3D side-by-side or up-down 3D file, it works with both, very simple - when you select the file you just choose how to watch it. The lighting is good, the quaility of the theater is excellent, the boat and home cinema are also nice but I'd never use it as the theater is dead on and the great choice for movies - maybe TV shows work better in others. For $10 get it - you'll use it a lot more than you think you will. A+.Couple more notes based on other feedback I've seen....I'm using a Oculus Rift no issues there. Personally I really like this better than something like Big Screen or Virtual Desktop as I just like the big theater more. While SBS 3D works perfectly for me, the top/bottom 3D (can't remember the name) is so so. Someone said they weren't getting surround sound, for me in the files I've tested I have - I believe this just looks at your Windows codecs, so if something doesn't work go grab the latest k-lite pack and that will probably fix it, BUT I'm not 100% on that.Big Screen Beta is free for now and certainly worth also checking out, it has a lot more features, but to my eye they way over do it on lighting and it's distracting - in this one the big theater is perfect with just the right amount of lighting boncing off the walls from the screen, its just crazy immersive, at least for me."

It is incredibly easy to use, easy to find your films and everything just works.You can reset your seat and it gives a countdown so that you can get into position - it's the little things like this that make it so user-friendly.The quality of the player is superb too - no juddering etc and it looks much better on the screen than the rest of the other players I've bought. Also, the Vive's len's seem to reflect light ( due to the staggered lens I suspect) and this app minimises that effect, so much so that it's pretty comfortable watching a full film on this.I'm so glad this was released...a big thumbs up from me! :)EDIT: I would love to see a super-sampling option in the future, along with multiplayer support of some kind. Watching a movie with a friend would be awesome!"

A good and complete VR CInema program!One of the biggest reasons I bought my Oculus Rift CV1 was because I loved to watch movies in VRcinema 3d back at the DK1 days, but when I bought the CV1, I saw VR Cinema 3d was no longer able to download and not optimzed for new VR headsets like the Oculus CV1 and the HTC Vive.       For that my quest to a new VR cinema started, and I haved used Bigscreen, VorpX Movie mode, (which is actually quite good, but its not a cinema experience), Oculus Video, and even Cineveo, but neither of them gives me the quality and immersive feeling of a real cinema as this!Finally some fine controls, decent file browsing, native Rift and Vive support, inapp view reset, easy navigation, and some cinema interaction which ALL other cinema apps are missing. And more things I am missing from other apps like Youtube integration which is awesome, and... seat change ability!  Its not the walking around in the cinema feeling like VR CInema3D had, but finally this feature is back.More features are coming to make this the best, most immersive, and complete VR CInema app at the moment, really loving it at the moment.

The dynamic lighting is very realistic and works just how it should in real-life, for example... when you watch a film on your real tv in a dark room the light from your tv screen will reflect off objects you have in your living space, this does just that and looks good for it.Picture quality is very good and i am very pleased with this purchase."
,Recommended,527160,30067056,Posted: 20 February,all,Blade Kite,"Hands down, this is the best app to watch movies, forget bigscreen, virtual desktop, etc. the quality that this app offers has no rival, the cinema like environment looks like you're there for real with the light reflections of the screen and everything. You can watch 3D and 360º videos from Youtube and has a Plex option that I don't know how it works, then you also have an option to watch movies from your PC (I usually download bluray and 3D movies), this is the function that I use the most. You can't watch stuff online like with bigscreen or virtual desktop but what I look for is that feeling of being at the cinema in the most realistic way that you can imagine. If you're looking for a similar experience and you truly want to feel like you are at the cinema watching a movie then buy this."

You’re sitting alone at home, in a virtual Cinema, by yourself, that’s fine, and if you’re ok with that, it’s a nice experience.  However with some imagination how much better would it be with some optional enhancements, like being able to turn on “other computer generated virtual cinema goers” so you feel like you’re not alone.  Throw in the occasional cough, rustle of popcorn, maybe the odd fart, even the late arrivals moving in front of you.  I’m left feeling it’s an opportunity missed to have a fun side option included.  I hope these are things that are eventually added."

I want to start off by saying the theatre and other sceneries look amazing. Top notch stuff. That's the only thing really good about this app. The menu's suck. The VR youtube videos don't even play right. The youtube VR videos are side by side and they play regular so it just hurts your eyes. The main reason I purchased this was that it said it had plex support. It said Plex had to be local. So I knew streaming outside of your home was out. What I didn't realize was that it wasn't talking about your local network, but rather your local machine. I know some people run  plex on their gaming rigs. Most seriouos collectors don't. You want a dedicated powerful machine (server) that's not juggling games and video playback. More importantly you don't want lots of hard drives in a hot box with a screaming GPU and CPU.  I'm really hoping they update this and improve the menu's and playback. Most importantly plex. That's the deal breaker for me. I caught this on sale, but it's still pretty useless to me other than a glorified youtube player. I'm better off just watching things in Big Screen. For the Developer, if you are reading this. This is real feedback, like it or not. If you want to talk to me or have me elaborate, just ask. I would love to talk or work with you to make this better. Sadly, right now it's not cutting it."

When loading my plex library everything shutters really badly no matter what background I'm using. Once it starts playing it works fine. Other issues though is when you have a massive plex library you can't sort by most recent which is a big fail. Youtube direct access is cool but this program won't do any 360 3D videos at all. At least I can't find it anywhere to enable it which means half of all 3d content is unwatchable with this app. Also it just doesn't load youtube but rather it requires you to already know what you want to see vs normal youtube suggesting something new and relevant to what you normally watch. I'm debating a refund but I'm hoping to see some improvements before I throw in the towel. Right now though I have to say just wait for more updates before buying.

They developers deserve a pat on the pack.Here are some suggestions for the developers.Number 1: Allow me to use my keyboard to type in game. As it can be a big pain having to move your head to every letter and takes time.Number 2: The vive motes are remotes basically so let us point to stuff instead of having to move are heads everywhere and pressing the trigger.Number 3: Add multiplayer allow us to sit with are friends and watch a movie that would be so incredible.Number 4: Allow us to move around freely in the environments using a locomotion system as they do in games like onwards, So basically holding the Vive pad in the direction you want will move you in that direction. This would come in handy in multiplayer.Number 4: More environments or let people make there own and add steam workshop support"

You have very little options when it comes to where your sitting. On top of that you have no control over lighing or anything else in this app2)The sound. If your going to create a cinema sim then you should simulate the sound of one. The sound is the same as iff you where watching it on your monitor.3)The picture quality is horrid. The vive and oculus just wernt mad for this sort of thing. I tried everything from youtube to a 4k UHD movie i have saved on my hard drive and it looks like dookie. It looks like a game from the 90s with no anti-aliasing.The fact that ther are apps that do what this dose for free says something about the devs. If this was a free app or maybe a few bucks then id say its worth it but even at half off this is a mony grab rip off.I cant say this loud enough, STAY AWAY FROM THIS."

I definitely recommend all of you to buy it since the price isnt high and the features are phenomenal.I have somethings I wish the developers could answer, because social rooms are being more and more popular in VR and im someone thats spreading the word about CMOAR, so id like answer to somethings like:- Wheres last position guys??? This would be so easy for you guys to fix it and its a pain the a** to have remember my videos last position everytime.- Ive read some people talking about people in the cinema enviroment... man THEYRE  ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!! you guys made such a nice enviroment, cmon, add the option about NPCs (bots) in the cinema. We could have the option to LOW CROWD, MODERATE CROWD, VERY CROWD (they could be eating popcorn, or whispering to each other...).- Maybe you could start to think about sharing movies spaces . I mean, if im watching a move in CMOAR and that room is public, people could join my room.- Wheres netflix support? (maybe there are legal issues, idk, but id like to understand...THATS IT... WELL!!!! everyone this a fantastic app!! GO FOR IT"

,Recommended,527160,28608220,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,smartbombradio,"Very nice atmosphere to watch YouTube and video files. Cannot currently do netflix, DVDS, etc, though, which may not make it worth the price for people (at least add a stream desktop option, dev.)If that's the formats you're using I like this theater environment the best out of what I've tried so far - it delivers a big, beautiful theater experience. So I recomend with the caveat that at the moment the selection of environments is limited, and so are the films it can use. May want to wait for a sale, which it's on during my review so for the price it might be worth it straight up, ATM.If you need Netflix, or want to watch with friends (or because it's free) use Bigscreen beta, but this product really does have great value if your needs line up with its, currently limited, abilities."

Although I do have an older system so there's that.  One thing I wish it had was 5.1 audio support.  The cinema experience isn't complete without surround sound.  There is also this weird dusty effect that builds up after a certain amount of time while watching movies, not sure how to get rid of it besides changing the scenery over and over.  With a few improvements this could be a really solid buy."

,Recommended,527160,28582588,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,MrOrange,Edit to original review: Originally I have this game a no rating due to lack of desktop support and other platforms besides YouTube and local files.  I am changing the review to a yes for a few reasons now.  First the developer is a really nice guy and reached out to me asking for my opinion and in my opinion that is really cool.  Second he promised to do his best on adding more features and platforms and I don't want this no review to hurt a game with an active dev that is trying to improve his game.  The cinema is pretty breathtaking graphics wise too.
,Recommended,527160,33169238,Posted: 2 July,all,brotherbobby,"Wow!  I am blown away at this.  It's like being at an IMAX Theater.  I have some IMAX movies and it's as close as it gets for screen size (it's just missing the surround sound).  I don't have any cons as of yet.  I've only tried it a bit, but my short try I've tested every feature.  It plays SBS and Top/Bottom 3D rendered movies.  If you rip your Blu-ray 3D movies, just select one of these options for the output and you're golden.  It works flawlessly.  You can see the supported video formats in the description.  They all work well and it's a very nice experience.It contains different arenas from which to watch your movies.  My favorite scene is the Cinema.  It really feels like you're setting in the theatre, and the devs took great concern into detail so much that the light from the screen reflects on the walls making the experience even more immersive.  Other scenes include a boat theatre (you sit in a boat on water to watch a movie), home cinema (smaller theatre setting), and blank-void (all you see is the screen. the rest is black).The menus are nice and navigatable without any instructions.  The screen is resizeable.  Only flaw is the resize icon is always visible in the top right, but it's not a deal breaker.  It just needs to hide after a short period of time.  Maybe it does, and I just wasn't paying attention.It includes features that will display videos in 360* or 180*, just be aware that quality can be affected when stretched, but it's an interesting feature.I highly recommend this application if you want a theatre experience without leaving  your home and don't have the space to set up your own home theatre.  It's on sale for $4.99 during the Steam Summer Sale.  Well worth it!!"
76561198014817484,Recommended,527160,34739769,Posted: 4 September,all,JadedWings,"Bought Cmoar just because im a big fan of vr video players,My absolute favorite is Big Screen as it offers imho the mostfreedom and best quality of everything.Cmoar is the second best vr video player i think, if not it goeshead to head with Vive player in terms ofenviroments and funtionality.Cmoar also can't scale 16:9 video's to fit the screen,something VLC player offers when watchingmovies in Big Screen. Also the subtitles can be changed to whatevercolour you like in VLC player..Cmoar offers like 5 environments wheretwo of them are good and the rest are not cozy or make youfeel uncomfortable.So the Big cinema is imho a great one and the Void one too,as it offers no distraction. What they did do is change the subtitle colourto a light grey colour to get rid of godrays, but stilldue to the unchangable ratio the godrays are very much visable,compared to the Grand theater inBig Screen it's a night and day difference, so this leaves Cmoar towork on their environments to improve upon this.Would I recommend you to buy this product??Yes...But only because i hope and think the developer is going to beworking on this software and make it better than it is at this point.Like the cinema, when looking at the ceiling where the walls join, try followingthe joint from beginning to end you'll notice a wrong placed wall....Plus the ceiling blocks are too small so both side have half blocks,something that would not be done in construction, but hey not every onewould notice but I did, I like perfect products and this isn'tperfect imho.Plus the oculus rift touch controllers won't hide when not beiing used...I rate it 7/10"
