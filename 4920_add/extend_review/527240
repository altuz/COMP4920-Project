,Recommended,527240,31662259,Posted: 10 May,all,EdenStarGazer,"A mining sim clicker with a ton of tools to keep you clicking!I’m new to clickers, so I was thinking, “There is no point in this game whatsoever…yeah, and it’s just fun!” My favorite genre is empire building games like Civilization, puzzlers, and economic sims; so this is a definite break from the mind melting world domination games.In Geology Business, a hard-working Indie mining simulator,you have to get 100K actual human clicks to complete the game.No way around that here with macros. In the early game, when the clicks seemed monumental, I felt overwhelmed. But, once I’d purchased enough workers to semi-automate the cash flow, then the tools & backgrounds started unlocking. By the time I got the Kalashnikov rifle I was happy I’d kept clicking.But, then the late game opened up a whole new twist.Secret messages and codes were discovered in the mine.I enjoyed reading the large enigma message hidden inside the game by the developer. He also added himself as a tool, and his face in the loot drops. It gives the game a personal touch as an Indie game.Yes, I did every last click and couldn’t quit this game until I had all the stuff! If you like clickers… I recommend this for you. No micro-transactions, just good clicky fun.With almost 16 hours for 2 bucks, the time in game is definitely worth it."

However, I feel it is well worth it.This is NOT the same genre of Adventure Capitalist or Clicker Heroes where you are constantly idling and waiting to break through barriers of exponentially increasing costs.  This is more like many of the original idle games:  have a pretty constant progression, buy upgrades, and purchase everything in the game.The UI is smooth, and it is pretty satisfying to actually view the minerals you have mined scroll across the conveyor belt.  Overall, a very satisfying experience for a clicker game."

,Recommended,527240,30220208,Posted: 27 February,all,Nide #1HP Warrior,"Ok, so I bought this game hoping it would be a fun way to pass time. As for all of us the first impression of a game is the most crucial one. I didn't really like it at first so I was going to refund it but then I thought I'd give it another try and I glanced through the achievements and noticed ""Master mind"" It's not really much to it but there are hidden clues and codes in the game that you unlock as you go. I don't know if it's just me and being passionate about cracking codes and puzzles but it changed my perspective of the game. It became so much funnier trying to hunt down the clues and solve them. Keep an eye out folks!"
76561198181512199,Not Recommended,527240,32712389,Posted: 23 June,all,Something Special,The game could definitely be better. It has a unique design to it and I feel more effort was put into the background and music then the game itself. This is a very original idea that if had some major updates like  a tutorial added and more things to do in it could be a really big hit. But for now it probably won't make a lot of people happy.
,Recommended,527240,30358217,Posted: 6 March,all,Dozenbeer,"Its good for a clicker/idle game, I liked a lot of the unlockables.Pros:+ the soundtrack is awesome, some really catchy tunes+ the different tools are interesting and cool to unlock+ going idle works fine and can be improved+ more and more stuff unlocks with progression (I mean without spending money)+ a lot of rocktypes with different droprates+ you can see what special drops and rocks you got+ for every tool there are a couple of skins to buy+ the game is cheap+ a good idle game for when you are in the kitchen or clean your placeCons:- its too mindless, there is no strategy on what to unlock- unlocking new tools is kinda unnecessary when you just wanna go idle- I didnt feel much like clicking in this game, its not rewarding enough- If you idle for day and night, the game could be over in less than 2 days-I thought you could hold the mouse button on the drills, but you still have to clickI liked this game. Its for idle/clicker fans specifically and a good game to have on when doing other stuff, like writing this review :) Its definitely not a very strategic game to play, just a little bit to do on the side.The price is cheap and you definitely get your moneys worth."

,Recommended,527240,30990337,Posted: 6 April,all,Red Beans,"I have played some extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clicker/idle games in my day. This one, however, is not one of them. I was skeptical when I saw it was not a free game like most games of the genre, but it is well worth it. The gameplay is simple, yet satisfying, and there is very well placed humor: abundant yet not overdone. Games like these are not for everyone, but if you are into them, it is for sure worth picking up."
76561198007471259,Not Recommended,527240,32829913,Posted: 26 June,all,Adrian,"One of the most boring clicker games... basically, after the first few upgrades, you never need to click again, as idle mode (online) will be much faster than you can ever click. Worst, there is no tutorial, no welcome or anything, nothing is explained, and nothing changes from start to finish of the game.There are some nice unlockable music pieces, and some hidden codes, but thats all and does not save the main game, which is aboslutely boring (and there is no offline mode either). 2/10. Avoid!"

,Not Recommended,527240,30244657,Posted: 28 February,all,Nantes,"TL;DR: Compared to the mechanics and depth of almost any other clicker game, this one is a joke.I'm a fan of idler games. I'm currently playing Crush Crush and Midas Gold Plus, but have played in the past Clicker Heroes, Adventure Capitalist and several lesser known ones. This game pales in comparison to any of those. The gameplay is extremely simplistic, consisting merely of turning on your autoclicker (which you WILL do unless you hate your left mouse button) and waiting for the cash to come by, buy a better tool to mine, and ocasionally buy miners/idlers (that cannot compete with the clicking in terms of output) and a new song or background. Oh, and every 1000 clicks you also get 5x increased speed for 30 seconds. That's it! I was bored after half an hour already, whereas I will happily play other clicker games for weeks.The only (mildly) interesting aspect is seeing what new minerals you discover, and there are tons of them.Apparently there is also a big secret in the form of a ""codebreaker"" achievement, but I couldn't be bothered to sit through any more autoclicking just to see what that was about."

(Even though some of these have been mentioned already elsewhere in the forums)Pros:1. Graphics are nicely done for a clicker/idle game (I'm not one who cares whether graphics are nicely done or not as I play many different types of idle/incremental games with varying graphical styles and at least one has its own hand made art)2. Many different choices of tools and pick axe handles (I like choices)3. Many different types of ore (both realistic and fantasy)4. A lot of choices in upgrades5. A nice assortment of music that you can buy. (In game currency not real currency)6. It's not that bad for the priceCons: (not so much cons as it is missing features that could be added to make the game even better (If any of these are done already I will mark it with an astrerisk))1. A type of currency that can be used after a certain type of reset so that it could be used to boost profits and increase chances to get better minerals and ore later on in the game.2. I'm not sure if there is a mute feature in this game.3. No Full screen as far as I'm aware4. No varying resolutions yet eitherIt does still seem a bit bare bones at the moment, but less so than another I've played, which is a good thing. I'm still recommending this as It's fun and at least it isn't in EA."
