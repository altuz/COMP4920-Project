76561198040879146,Recommended,527290,30380063,Posted: 7 March,all,Marc,"Note: I have spent 100+ hours on the game on PS4 (Chinese version released back in January), bought this in steam to support the developers, hence the low hour count.tl;dr : Scroll down to blue text for a quick summary.For those who are new to the Atelier Series of games,you should check out my review on the previous installment of the serieshere, many aspects are similar and carry over to this game.I'll get straight to the point here, the main aspects which Atelier Firisdifferfrom Sophie:Instead of choosing a location on the world map and ""fast-travelling"" there, thewhole world map is now connected by pathswhich you'll walk through. (Some sort of fast-travelling is still available, and other methods of transport can be unlocked later in game.)Each area of the world map is nowmuch largerthan the previous game, and is one single large area, instead of a few small sections separated by loading screens.(Sophie's world system: Choose destination on world map, then ""dungeon crawl"" with multiple sections.)(Firis' world system : Open world exploration, though not seamless as there are (short) loading screens between areas.)There is no ""home town"" which you need to return to after each expedition, you nowcarry your home/atelier/crafting room) with youas you travel!The grid-jigsaw alchemy system is retained, but there are some changes in mechanics.The battle system is also changed, which I would not delve into the details.Weapons and gear can now grant the wielder new skills, depending on the gear & your alchemy process.The main story is divided into 2 segments, the first segment has a clear goal with a time limit,but don't fret as it is quite lenient.The 2nd half has no time limit, and grants the player complete freedom in exploration and quests.What I think isbetter compared to Atelier Sophie:The whole world feels much more connected, as it basically transformed into a true open world exploration system.The exploration feels more open and free as you carry your atelier/home with you, eliminating the need to backtrack and return to a main town/settlement, which breaks the ""flow"" of exploration.The 1st half of the story basically tells you to travel from one corner of the world map to the other, guiding the player to explore the world.Combining the above 3 points, the exploration is miles ahead of Atelier Sophie, and truly fits the ""Mysterious Journey"" subtitle.This is subjective, but I find the alchemy system more fun in this one than in Sophie.Also subjective, IMO the soundtrack of this one is better than in Sophie.What I think isworse compared to Atelier Sophie:Character interaction. In the 1st half of the story, interaction with some side-characters are pretty shallow (or even awkward). It gets better in the 2nd half though, as character specific quest lines are unlocked.Battle system. The system felt less in depth this time around.The alchemy proficiency/skill level for each item. You need to craft the same item multiple times before you can use your full alchemy abilities when crafting them. This is unneccessary ""grinding"" IMO, a minor annoyance.Firis' outfits' abilities. Different outfits for Firis grants her different (useful) bonuses, the need to change clothing every time you want a different ability is a bit irritating. (In New Game+ all abilities are active at all times, eliminating this issue, but you need to finish the game once first, due to this fact I semi-rushed through my first playthrough.)The requirements for unlocking alchemy recipes are not clearly presented to players, players going in completely blind may have trouble discovering them. Although the game has a system which allows player to bypass these requirements (limited use) which alleviates the issues somewhat.A general summary of why I recommend this game (May contain points above):Happy atmosphere & relaxing gameplay - the defining aspects of the Atelier Series IMO.In-depth alchemy/crafting system which is very rewarding when mastered.Fantastic world exploration and sense of journey.Great soundtrack, some of which are live recordings.If you liked Atelier Sophie, you most likely would like this too. The quality of games in the Atelier Series are pretty consistent.This game'sweaknesses, and other issues that you should be wary of:No strong story or epic & heroic chapters, pretty light in general.Less character interaction/development than other full-fledged story-rich RPGs.Battles system quite simple/shallow, not quite strategic.Although this is the 2nd installment, new players don't need to play the 1st, not much is lost apart from background lore of the world & some side characters.Potential UI element quality,performance & control mappingissues due to being a PS4 port, I will reference other reviewer's results, and also do some simple testing myself, and update this review accordingly.(Update : Quick test results below, mostly good news.)tl;dr : If you like Atelier Sophie, you will like this too. If you haven't played the Atelier Series before, there is no problem playing this without playing previous titles, and I still recommend this joyful & relaxing J-RPG with a great in-depth crafting system.Quick test results regarding issues in Atelier Sophie, whether they are still here in Atelier Firis & other miscellaneous findings:The CPU usage is completely normal, this is fixed in Sophie so I think it is also fixed here. (CPU : i7 2600)The launcher window now provides a section to custom map your keyboard controls, rejoice keyboard users! (The implementation is crude though, but it works.)Funnily there is no menu option to exit the game, press ""Esc"" on your keyboard to quit. (Took me quite some time to find out, as I normally use an XBOX controller. I had to use ALT+F4 before I found this out heh.)Framerates are at stable 60FPS during roaming and in menus, except for occasional drops to 50~ incutscenes only.(CPU: i7 2600 , GPU: Geforce 980Ti, running at 2560x1440)The are no stutters or lags when opening the encyclopedia or the alchemy menu, so this problem is also fixed here.Currently there is only English UI, with the option for Japaneses vocals or English dub.(Update : Developers confirmed that Japanese UI & sutitiles will be added soon, clickherefor source.)Interestingly there is a ""LanguageType"" option in the launcher menu, but currently it is fixed as ""English"". Perhaps future updates would bring Japanese or even Chinese UI which can be selected here?Regarding quality of 2D assets (Sophie used lower quality PS3 2D assets in the Steam release, instead of better quality PS4 assets).(Update 2: I have checked and compareed the PC & PS4 (Non-Pro), sad to say the 2D UI elements indeed seem to be of the lower quality variant from PS Vita.)(Update: People in the forum seems to notice that the 2D assets are still in lower quality, I will recheck and verify it with my PS4 (non-Pro) once I get back home a few hours later). It seems to me that full quality assets are used this time.It seems many of issues & problems which plagued the Sophie release are fixed & corrected nicely, I thank the developers for their work, as well as the community who discovered and reported the issues to them. Everyone contributed to a better gaming experience, and I am grateful."

,Recommended,527290,30930833,Posted: 3 April,all,suikoder,"How Atelier Firis could turn to be the last Atelier game I play.In my long history with Atelier games I never was disappointed by any of them until Firis, and they never were so ambitious as Firis is, but not this, or lack of polish, or not the best port are reasons for my disappointment.So what's good about Firis:1.it's the open world in nature, for the first time in the Atelier game2. Complexity of alchemy is a notch down from Sophie, but in general alchemy feels better in Firis.3. Character endings are back4. The world is nice and monster design is great.5. It's a huge game6. learning alchemy and taking an actual exam of it is an interesting idea.7. Many interesting characters with their stories.8. Chain questswhat's not so good:1. Localization is poor2. Quest descriptions for many quests are wrong past the first step3. A game is way too demanding on hardware and runs poorly4. There are some glitches.the ugly:1. No real fast travel for 30-40 hours, depends on how fast you get there.2. Even when you get fast travel, it is limited, as there are parts of the world that allow no fast travel, and these aren't small locations, also filled with dangerous monsters (that can wipe out even strong party) without ability to save your game, of course.3. Sophie had an interesting system of unlocking alchemy recipes, which Firis ditched in favour of guessing what you should do and how many times to unlock what, yes guessing.4. Alchemy results in Firis are strongly dependent on quality, yet you can't register a single item in this game (just let it sink in). What means creating the same items ad nauseam over and over again, what takes extra hours upon hours of playtime for no reason.5. ridiculously small initial storage space available to you (you easily get it filled in first three-four locations) and you have no ability to sell anything for a long time after that. It never becomes sufficient too.6. Many character events are pure guesswork too, and not something that is obvious, or even logical or easy to guess because of lack of options, nothing of the sort.7. the game that can't be fully finished without of use of a guide (and that's not a few things but a whole lot of them), is not a well designed game in my book.so those seven reasons are that make me think that Firis can be my last atelier game. I can't tolerate even one of those, all of them? overkill.This is an end of era. I still have a hope that Gust will get some feedback and won't repeat all numerous mistakes they made with Firis.I only recommend this game because it has redeeming qualities, but if you wanna a real good Atelier game, you should play Atelier Sophie instead."
,Not Recommended,527290,30422045,Posted: 10 March,all,Kite,"Port ReviewThere are good things and bad things about this port.  I decided to lean to the negative side because the graphics do not justify the high requirements for this game. Also there are PS4 graphical features missing. I'll reevaluate this review if KT/Gust ever releases a patch to address some issues. If you don't have a PC that exceeds recommend requirements and have a PS4 then the PS4 is a better option even though it has frame-drops as well.Pros:- Variable frame-rate. If you have a high refresh-rate monitor and a very powerful video card you can play this game above 60 fps.- Synthesis does not have performance issue present in Atelier Sophie.  However, load is so low during Synthesis that powerful video cards may trigger power saving mode and drop below 60fps.  Workaround for Nvidia cards is to set ""Power Management Mode"" to ""Prefer Maximum Performance"" in Nvidia Control Panel.- Supports 1440p and 4k resolutions.Cons:- Really demanding game.  The system requirements for this game are no joke and won't get you 1080p60fps.  For 1080p60 you're looking at a RX 470/GTX 1060 and can still have drops in areas with lots of effects/shadows.- No Ambient Occlusion.  It exists in PS4 version.  Workaround is you can add it by using Reshade with MXAO shader, however will make game even more demanding.- Missing Lighting that is present in the PS4 version.- Low resolution 2D art assets. PS4 has higher resolution 2d assets.- Blocky character outlines make it looks like there is a lot of aliasing. Reshade SMAA doesn't work to remove them because they are too large to detect.- Shadows that disappear when source object moves off screen.- Some flickering textures.- Shadows that hit characters look broken.- No AA options. FXAA can be forced in video card control panel or SMAA with Reshade/sweetFx.- Only supports 5 different 16:9 resolutions.Prologue using Reshade on high end video card.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=880529903"
76561198040439031,Not Recommended,527290,30443793,Posted: 11 March,all,San-Kyu,"The game is workable and if you have ever played an Atelier game before you'll get more of the same except a few tweaks. Familiar faces are back and the plot is more towards the characters than any big world-ending problem, so don't expect an epic tale of heroes ala Final Fantasy or Tales of (again, nothing new to the Atelier franchise.). If you haven't played an Atelier game just know that its a Turn-based JRPG with a big focus on item construction, you live or die based on how well you've prepared your items, which you make from items you collect in the world. There's a relatively large depth and variety of items and associated traits you can gather and make, and really this will be attractive to powergamers and those who like crunching numbers to get the most OP characters ever.I love the Atelier franchise and I've gotten every one of their games since the PS2 era (Iris is the first I can remember), but this one I cannot recommend because of how amazingly bad the PC port is. The game works, but the graphical niggles are just too much. Shadows seem to pop in and out at random (just moving the camera with the character staying still causes it). Draw distance is ATTROCIOUS, just look in any direction and move, you will very visibly see assets pop in from short distances away. The ""open world"" just really serves to make traversing it more annoying, as it is literally just plain bigger without adding anything new to the system. The 2D art assets like character stat pictures and such are very low res, and there is no HDR and ambient occlusion (The PS4 version has it).The PS4 (not pro) version of this game does not have any of the problems I mentioned, and runs better FPS and detail even at 720p. I heavily suggest getting that version instead of this one, as it is as of this writing the definitive and most satisfying version of the game."

Atelier Firis definitely makes it a point to be particularly inconvenient at times. Perhaps the biggest example of this is the fact that you have to go hunt down characters to swap them in and out of your party even after you already met them.Pros+Open world exploration+Custom item creation top to bottom+Fun, quick battles+In-game music customizable+Easy to understand alchemy+Choices that matter+Endless replay value+Colorful, interesting characters+10 ENDING+(be sure to save and do the character side quest seperately)+Huge amount of contentCons-Slow movements-NPCs mostly static-Return of the dreaded time limit-Support Guard only protects Firis- Side characters seem a little blander than those in the previous titles.- Side characters seem a little blander than those in the previous titles.-Short on Main game story, Post game is rather long if you plan to get all 10 true endings.Neutral-Main Game seems shorter than post game-sidequest does not seems to be rewarding at all(too repetitive)-Niche gameplay-The second half of the game can be frustrating and overwhelming(if you do not have guide to help you)I admire Gust for delivering a product outside of their comfort zone. However, even though the open world is the most exciting new addition, it also tends to bring the most problems with it. Atelier Firis will surly impress fans of the franchise, but could feel dated to modern RPG fans.While still keeping its staple formula alive by maintaining the aspects of material gathering, simplistic turn-based battles, and alchemy, Atelier Firis is further improved by tweaking them in ways that’ll invite newcomers with open arms while keeping returning fans happy. While visually the game is a little rough, the sheer amount of things you can do and hours you’ll subsequently expend is endless. Atelier Firis: The Alchemist and the Mysterious Journey is a light-hearted and enjoyable JRPG where you can put your alchemy skills to the test.These are really minor complaints, though, when stacked against the fact that Atelier Firis took me back to the innocence and joy in those Arland games that got me interested in the series in the first place. Most importantly, given that this is the first time that he’s helmed the creative side of an Atelier title, Shinichi Yoshiike has proven himself to be a confident and safe pair of hands to shape the series into the future. As such, I expect that this series will continue to remain my favourite among the more traditional JRPG franchises out there.Despite its relatively flat cast, the game is a rather enjoyable experience that will feel well-rounded to fans of the series. The large map offers far more exploration opportunities than previous games did, which may help compensate for a pretty lackluster battle system. Smaller tweaks that combine older gameplay mechanics with some of the newer features from more recent titles like Atelier Sophie make Atelier Firis feel particularly special.While still keeping its staple formula alive by maintaining the aspects of material gathering, simplistic turn-based battles, and alchemy, Atelier Firis is further improved by tweaking them in ways that’ll invite newcomers with open arms while keeping returning fans happy. While visually the game is a little rough, the sheer amount of things you can do and hours you’ll subsequently expend is endless. Atelier Firis: The Alchemist and the Mysterious Journey is a light-hearted and enjoyable JRPG where you can put your alchemy skills to the test.This title certainly takes an interesting new turn in the franchise, improving some of its shortcomings, but not all of them. Still, a very good RPG Atelier fans should try.Presentation(4)The game world is stylized very well. The character models are incredibly detailed, the world is very large and diverse, much more than the last Atelier game, making it very fun to explore.Gameplay(4)While the battle system could be improved upon, synthesizing items is still a treat in this game. Throughout the game, players will have to explore, gather, collect recipes, and synthesize items together.Lasting Appeal(4.5)One might find themselves wanting to come back for more, even after beating the main game. There is so much to do that you might have to remind yourself to eat! The game sports multiple endings to encourage continued play, and the mix of the timed and untimed systems give everybody something to enjoy.Final Verdict 4.3/5Atelier Firis: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Journey is a game that can be played and enjoyed by both fans of the series, newcomers, and even people who would otherwise not consider it. It may not be a complete return to form for the series, but It does a great job of mixing both modern and classic Atelier games. I believe that it ranks slightly higher than the last entry.The presentation of the game is strong as well, with easy to navigate menus and plenty of shortcuts. The graphics are anime-chic, and definitely won’t wow you, but don’t let you down either. Perhaps most enjoyable is the music, and again this game allows you to use music from other titles in the Atelier family in place of the defaults."
,Recommended,527290,31736993,Posted: 13 May,all,Jackkel Dragon,"Now that I have over 75 hours logged in my main save, it might be time to write a review.For a long time before finding the Atelier series, I had been looking for a game like this. Atelier Firis is essentially a turn-based JRPG with a character-focused, mostly slice-of-life plot, but the real draw is the huge focus on gathering materials and using them to create your own items and equipment. While some JRPGs have you just buy items and gear from stores (with a lot of items not being worth it) and use different level up or skill systems to make things interesting, the Atelier games let you feel like you're making the tools you need to succeed. This entry (the 18th main game in the series, from what I hear) really does a great job of making crafting items easy to learn but still have depth for those who choose to master the system. Two instances of the same item will rarely be the same, so you have to make sure you make the right choices when crafting if you want to do well.The story of the game won't be too exciting if you want a strong plot-driven narrative, but if you can grow attached to the characters it can still be engaging. The first part of the game involves the lead, Firis Mistlud, learning to use alchemy and being given a year to pass the Alchemy Exam, which takes place in a city far from her home. Should she succeed, she then continues to adventure to try to find her calling in life. This is where the story (and game) really open up, as each companion has their own story arc and ending and many named NPCs have their own sideplots. While some characters take longer to develop than others, they all have at least a few interesting things about them to make the sideplots worth exploring.From a gameplay standpoint, Atelier Firis is an open-world game that encourages exploring each part of the large maps. While there is a chokepoint about halfway through the world map that requires a questline to open and not every area is available until after the Alchemy Exam, you'll still have more than enough ground to cover and explore. There's also a fast travel feature within maps, and after the exam you can complete a quest chain in order to get a way to warp to almost any area in the game from rest spots. There is a time limit for the first part of the game, but you are given plenty of time to do everything that must be done pre-exam with some time to spare. Even if you fail, you can load the bad ending save to get the same benefits as a New Game+ clear, which includes a few features that makes surviving the time limit and doing pre-exam questlines even easier.Aside from gathering items from the environment and making items from them, the game features combat with monsters as a big part of finding the best materials and completing some quest chains. The battles are played with a turn-based system that changes turn order based on stats, actions, and buffs/debuffs. While normal attacks and skills are available for each character (and can become powerful in the late game), the early and mid game will put a huge emphasis on item use. While only Firis and the alchemist party members can use a lot of items, everyone has access to some types of items and they are powerful for a huge part of the game (even into the endgame, if you craft them right). Making sure you have a good set of attack and healing items is essential before getting into any fights, because Firis is not a front-line fighter and there's only so much the rest of the team can do without item support. There's also an interesting system where a meter depicts how well your team is working together (which increases when you do damage to enemies) that can be expended to protect Firis from attacks or filled to unlock limit break-esque attacks. The game also has anti-grinding measures to force you to move into harder areas if you want to level up quickly, so you have to make sure to be improving your items and gear whenever you can to prepare for the next region. Items are also useful outside of battles, as they can be used to gather materials (such as bombing a rock) or alter the environment.A few minor negative points do come up, though not enough to make me dislike the game. One problem I had early on is that fast travel between areas is not available until after the exam, which means a lot of walking when backtracking for materials (since in-map shortcut points are almost never near exits to areas). Another issue is the poor requirements for some recipes in the recipe idea unlock system (which gives you recipes based on what you do). Some items have absurd requirements, giving an otherwise cool system idea a bad reputation. It also doesn't help that some recipes get glitched if you complete certain quests too early, preventing 100% completion without doing a New Game+. The last, and probably least, of the issues is that I keep being annoyed by how ""Atelier"" is pronounced in the English voice track. The original French word sounds sort of like ""a-tel-ee-ay"", the Spanish cognate should sound something like ""a-tel-ee-er"". The English voice track for this game uses the made-up (as far as I can tell) pronunciation ""at-lee-ur"", which ignores the first ""e"" in the word. A small issue in the grand scheme of things, but with the Japanese word being closer to proper French (""a-to-ree-ay""), it gets a bit strange when the English actors are made to mispronounce a word.Overall, Atelier Firis is a great game and, in my opinion, a good way to be introduced to the series. It has inspired me to seek out previous games in the series (particularly the game it's a sequel to, Atelier Sophie) to have further crafting adventures. If you're interested in a JRPG that gives items and crafting a big focus and tells a character-driven coming of age story, Atelier Firis might be a good fit for you."

You may think that this is bad, but believe me, the game still looks GOOD, as long as you can bear low FPS at some moment.[EDIT: IT IS NOT, i didn't set my radeon vga to run in this game, it didn't set up automatically, so i need to set it up. Finally i can run this game smoothly in normal shadow mode, and yes, this game is so beautiful.]This is my second atelier series after Sophie, and compared to Sophie, the adventure feeling in firis is a lot stronger, i love the feeling when i found new places, items and people. But i have a mixed feeling about the time limit system, in other side it makes this game more challenging, but in the other side i can't roam freely (yet). The sythesis and battle system is also a bit different from sophie, and in my opinion Firis has better system in both sythesis and battle. The biggest downside of this game in my opinion is the teleport system, it's not really helping, there aren't many teleport point, so you still need to waste your precious time to go to areas that don't have teleport point in there.Like i mentioned before that i've played Atelier Sophie, and i think if you have finished Sophie, you really want to play this game, but if you haven't finished the previous game, it's still okay, but maybe you'll get different experience from what i've got.I love that Sophie showed up from the beginningIf you love discovering new things and places, i really recommend this game."

,Recommended,527290,30572633,Posted: 17 March,all,SKILLS,"Take everything you know and love about the Atelier games, and combine that with an open world over ten times the size of the previous games. The result is Atelier Firis, one of the most ambitious and largest Atelier games to date.Atelier Firis is the 18th game in the long running Atelier series, and the second game in the Mysterious trilogy. Firis, an energetic girl, hopes to take and pass the alchemist's license exam in order to fulfill her dream of traveling outside. Atelier Firis is by far the largest Atelier world in the entire series. In the previous installment, Atelier Sophie, the main character, Sophie, lives in Kirchen Bell. Sophie explores various fields around Kirchen Bell to harvest materials, and once she finishes gathering materials, she returns to her atelier back in Kirchen Bell. Now, in Atelier Firis, your atelier travels with you in the form of a tent! Gathering materials and exploring the world has never been easier.Some notable differences from Atelier Sophie include the return of a time limit from older Atelier games. For Firis to gain her freedom outside, she is given a month to complete a few assignments to prove her ability to survive outside. After she leaves her hometown, Firis has one more generous time limit of a year to take and pass the license exam. After passing the license exam, the time limit is lifted and you are free to do whatever you please. Another notable difference is the revamp of the energy system. In Atelier Sophie, moving around the world map would use up some energy, also known as LP. In Atelier Firis, in addition to moving around the world, performing actions such as gathering materials and fishing will use up LP. Depending on the clothing and terrain of the area Firis explores, LP loss may increase. For example, not wearing proper clothing in the cold will accelerate LP loss.The difficulty and battle system in Atelier Firis has changed since Atelier Sophie. Instead of selecting actions for all characters at once in one turn, each character performs actions on their turn, allowing for more complex strategies to be used. The obnoxious offensive and defensive battle stances have been removed and replaced with the new Chain Link gauge. As characters attack enemies, this gauge slowly rises. Once full, characters can perform powerful attacks and unleash their ultimate abilities, which can determine the win or loss of a battle.The alchemy system has been improved since Atelier Sophie. Cauldrons have been removed and catalysts have been introduced. Each catalyst contains lines and patterns in the synthesis grid that give bonuses once the lines or patterns are filled. Some of the bonuses include increased final item quality and new transferrable traits to the final item.New Game + has been added in Atelier Firis, allowing some progress such as character equipment and money to be carried over from a completed save into a new game. New Game + also unlocks some extra perks, such as the Very Hard difficulty balanced for New Game +.Overall, Atelier Firis is a step up from previous Atelier games, and is my new favorite Atelier game in the series. The large open world and the extensive alchemy system keeps the game fun and exciting to play."

Actually, because of the maps I think this is a better point to start the series on."

Nitpicking, also had *minor* stutter exiting buildings in towns. So far it's a lot more enjoyable then other Altier games I've played. Bigger worlds to explore rather then jumping between hubs as promised, just hope it keeps up the pace. Think everyone can agree a better price would have been nice, perhaps 40-50$. Still a niche game series without a large fanbase (on PC). As always recommend using a gamepad, just makes life easier. 4k supported via the launcher, well over 60fps on a gtx970 and 3770k.No commentary Prologue playthrough.

I would like to share some pros and cons of this game.Pros:1. Huge map. Lots of quests. The content really worths its price tag.2. As always, well-designed characters (with some stereotypes).3. I heard scary stories regarding bugs in the earlier version but I found no bug so far in current version after 40+ hrs of play. There is one region that I saw slight drop in frame refresh rates on my system (i7 + GTX960) but nothing critical.4. Japanese interface and subtitle - maybe not so important for most users on Steam, but I should say this is a huge step forward for the major Japanese game publisher on Steam. I really don't understand why the major Japanese publishers exclude Japanese interface / subtitle support in the list of languages. What's the point? Why only Japanese? Even though they included audio?Cons:1. Lack of transportation despite huge map - There is a landmark feature that you can jump between important locations within a regional map. Moreover, after the license exam, you can synthesize a flying broomstick that travels fast and flies over lake & river (...and also easy to ride & perfect for cleaning). However, there should be a way to make inter-region travel more efficiently, by single button press. It's not something new. There has been a feature like that in the past releases. But in this one, they made that huge world map, but there's no way to ""warp"" from one region to another, which I thought nonsense. Please let me know if any of you found the way. (Edit: It turns out there is a way. But I won't write detail since it will be a spoiler. Basically, you can create a flying ship and you can jump across regions. Still, you can only jump from the fireplaces)2. Missing mass-production shop - This was one important aspect of the modern atelier series releases. I wonder why they removed it. Or maybe it's hidden somewhere?In conclusion, I strongly recommend this game to all Atelier-series & JRPG fans. I wish I could recommend to everyone, but this game series requires some special characteristics from users who can do following:1. You don't get upset even if your party at max level dies in single attack by an enemy boss.2. You are ready to do seemingly tedius, repetitive work again and again to make the best bomb, armo, and accesories.3. You become happy when you beat the enemy boss from #1 after countless trials of #2.4. You become happier when you break the max damage record in a single bombing to the boss from #1.5. You feel relieved when you found the most efficient way to complete all tasks and beat all bosses within shortest amount of days."
,Not Recommended,527290,30455530,Posted: 11 March,all,Black Heart,"I want to like this game. I own and have loved every Atelier that came to the PS3, apart from Sophie, which I bought on PC and am in the process of refunding because it still looks and runs like trash. Unfortunately, in spite of (or perhaps because of) the fact that I am sure that if it were properly ported and polished it would be a lot of fun to play, I am not going to recommend this game to anyone for the following reasons.Here are my observations. To be fair, I am not skilled enough to break open any logs or anything to know what is happening or why, but with the tools I have at hand this is what I saw.Session 1:1. The animations on menu items do not run at a smooth framerate. The particles kind of just jump around every couple of seconds.2. At startup, the game loads my CPU up to 80% on all 8 threads and drops down to 5-10% and doesn't move from there. There is no meaningful change in CPU temperature.3. GPU utilization floats between 50% and 60%, frame buffer sits around 30%, memory usage at 10% but the video engine does not appear to be used at all. It sits at a constant 0%, as if I haven't left the desktop. However there is no meaningful change in GPU temperature, either.4. The game looks like absolute trash at 1080p. Like, it looks worse than Atelier Totori on the VITA (the best at-hand comparison I have). There are jagged edges, hard shadows and artefacts everywhere. Even facial features are somewhat blurry and mouths look jagged.5. The 2D assets appear to be low resolution. They are not sharpened at all. I've seen anime at 480p with sharper 2D drawings for splashes than this game has.Session 2:1. The draw distance on this game is terrible, with distant objects flickering in and out of view depending on how you move around.2. It seems to run at a stable framerate, but that could just be how far overspec I am for this game.Still no meaningful jumps in CPU or GPU temperature.Session 3:1. 'Atlier' TRIGGERING INTENSIFIES!!2. Following a comment from Kite on another thread, did some looking at light sources in the game and it looks like it has forced-on occlusion culling and still eats resources it in absolutely no way should require even if it didn't have occlusion culling on.CPU loaded up to 100% across all eight threads for no discernible reason, temperature hit 58C. GPU temperature jumped up to 61C, with no obvious reason for that either. Normal CPU temperature for me is 32C and GPU is 44C.I think that unless Koei Tecmo (and/or GUST) acknowledge and attempt to fix it themselves, this'll be yet another refund. This game eats system resources on a scale that Witcher 3 on ultra settings does not. I refuse to accept this kind of delivered product, no matter what platform I'm on but especially not on PC, and not at this price point. This is not a finished product. It's a mess."
76561197967355674,Recommended,527290,30627792,Posted: 19 March,all,MEOWGGOTS!@!,"This game grows up on you. It is not the best game graphically nor gameplay-wise but if you like the puzzle-like atmosphere of creating multiple items you'll might enjoy this. Lemme write a few lines about what I like and dislike about the game:Like:- MC kinda grows up on you (she's really clumsy, innocent and enthusiastic. Her voice actress really nails it).- World is very large; Comparing it to Sophie you'll feel like they're worlds apart. Maps take several minutes to traverse.- Game expands a lot after you complete the Alchemist exam (timed part of the game). You'll get several tools to travel faster around the world (like a flying broom and an airship).- Music is catchy. Sometimes the cheerfulness is a bit annoying if you're doing some mass crafting but otherwise it's not bad.- Crafting is interesting. You'll experiment a lot trying to create the perfect bomb or potion!Dislike:- Some gameplay choices are pretty stupid.- When delivering items to NPCs the game'll ask confirmation but it defaults to no. Press it accidentaly and it'll unselect all items, making a pain if you were choosing certain ones to deliver.- Selling items is a chore as each NPC will only buy certain items which means you might have to travel to other cities.- Sometimes it's a pain to find certain recipes or items when you have too many different types; Even with tabs the most cluttered one is the 'Synth' one and it's a pain to find some items you didn't craft a lot.- As I played Atelier Sophie I didn't have too many problems figuring things out but you'll die a lot if you don't know how to craft certain traits on your gear that give +all stats to you characters.So should you play this? I'd recommend this only if you don't mind playing a Japanese style RPG with turn-based combat and a clunky interface. If you can get past the bad parts you'll find something interesting under it."

,Recommended,527290,33838505,Posted: 27 July,all,(!)macskyfractals(¡),"Atelier Firis is a story about finding your own way in life, discovering who – and what, exactly you are – and helping those you meet along the way do the same. It is a game about fulfilling dreams and potential, with a strong message of “it isn’t the destination, it’s the journey” tied in for good measure.The gameplay matches that aesthetic. From the very first step outside of your small, isolated town as Firis Mistlud, the world seems massive, daunting and full of wonder. But just like your little alchemic companion, you aren’t afraid – the game places you in the first level and essentially forces you to take in all its breadth.See my full review here at Gamespot, with pretty pics, since Steam won't let me type my full thoughts :3https://www.gamespot.com/atelier-firis-the-alchemist-and-the-mysterious/user-reviews/2200-12734624/"

The two games are very similar, they even share a fair few characters, only this game gives you a timelimit.

This is more challenging, and time-consuming as it presents new feature such as world map travel with huge maps which isn't available to older series, with the ""easy"" route such as duplicating and restocking features are gone / modified. Also the painly annoying alchemy compared to the older easy alchemy. Also the battles become surprisingly more difficult due to the ""BUG"" that makes bomb with ""One-Hit Kill"" trait never actually K.O'd any monster unless the damage is more than the monster HP.
