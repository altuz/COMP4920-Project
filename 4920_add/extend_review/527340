It's feels so good when enemy losts you under his nose and you stabbing him in the back few seconds later.In pros I can include:Fun gameplayInteresting idea and humor of the game (Battle of Snakes! Yay!)Good mapsPretty visualsGodlike main menu musicIt's 40mb. And it's worth every hour of downloading time.Cons of this game is typical for early access game (I think it's not in EA only because ea always scares players away):Lack of content (for such simple game right now it's had enough to be fun, but in future it will be nice to see more props, weapons, maps, customization and etc)Lack of optimisation (just don't touch graphics settings and you'll be fine, probably. It can run on a potato in theory. Also FPS drops are rare and not really noticable in the action because of game flow.)Small problems with surroundings and hitboxes (avoid corners if you can)Lack of playersObviously for small indie, multiplayer only game only last problem is really matter.AndYoucan help solve it by buing this game.

Don't buy it.Cute little take on prop hunt from Garry's Mod. Maybe worth checking out if the concept interests you enough and you have $4 to blow, but it doesn't really have any staying power. Map design isn't noteworthy, and the game modes vary from frantic and fun to interminably boring. It can be fun when the mode forces everybody to keep moving but it can also be a total camp fest that rewards never moving at all. It could potentially be fun to play with friends but it's not really interesting with pubbies.Overall, the biggest downside I see to this game is that I simply don't see the multiplayer population lasting very long. This is exactly the kind of gimmick steam game that probably won't have anybody playing it in a month's time. It's competently made enough, and it plays pretty much exactly how it seems like it would, so it's not really worth getting a refund over. I highly doubt I'll ever end up going back to this one though. Unless you're specifically looking for a cheap, goofy LAN party game for friends, save your money and don't bother."

This game is ment to be played with friends and with them it makes the game totally worth it. If you don't have friends that you can play this with, I wouldn't really recommend it because of the lack of players. It's one of those games that you play with your friends just to mess around and have a good time. Overall it kind of lacks in content, but the game is very fun if you have friends.

I would definitely recommend this game for the pricetag of $4 or $5. One suggestion I have for the devs though - when you spawn, it's very easy for other players to see where you spawn because your box just appears and you have no camo in the middle of the firefight. It would be great if you would spawn as one of the boxes that's already a prop in the map - that way you don't give away your spawn point to other players."

Get it, have fun.Here's some suggestions to devs:• when in 1st person and 'anti-camping' is on, make the circle at the center into any eye to show that you have Fragile tags on your box. In some 3rd person camera views you can't see your box. The eye would help in all views.• Seems like 90% of knife-on-knifes result in double-kills... work on those odds? Maybe double-kills could instead be knife clashes that result in sparks and no kills?• Love the decoy aspect of the game. Maybe add: spray paint tags to throw off opponents? Laser images you can shine on other boxes to fake a camper Fragile stamp?• In Red vs Blue, maybe red tape on Red team boxes and blue tape on Blue team. You'd need to randomize tape on all other boxes.• Would be nice to see a gun/knife icon next to the kill announcement• Definitely flame thrower• Clear packing tape trip-lines for explosives• Larger box on my box as a shield? <-made from dead opponent boxes• Conveyer belts• Furnaces•••• Laser swords that can deflect laser blasters ••••• Deathmatch mode where your score is net Kills-Killed (grinder = -2)"

For starters, the music. The music is just terrible, the music while in a game was forgetable at best and the music with vocals that played in menus and at the end of a round was just something else. The singer's voice alone just kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off (Not your fault devs, just a note.) which isn't too bad on its own, but when you couple it with the fact that the songs all sound like they were made in a couple minutes made me mute the music volume after a couple minutes. The next, fairly unimportant thing that really bugged me about this game is that the only playstyle that will get you frags is to just sit around like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ and wait to either steal someones kill or to just ambush someone having fun. Next up, the movement. It feels like I'm controlling a mars rover with stiff movements and VERY significant input lag. Stiff movement is acceptable if everything else checks out or the devs actually fix their♥♥♥♥♥♥ but input lag kills games. The low framerates are also god awful. I get about the same framerate in SHADOW OF ♥♥♥♥ING MORDOR and Saints Row 3 as I do in this game. That's just not ♥♥♥♥ing acceptable. Shadow of mordor looks leaps and bounds better than this could ever hope for and they still get the same framerate on my rig (FX-6300, GT 730, 4GB RAM) but I'm willing to pin that issue on OpenGL and Linux compatibility rather than on the game itself, but no one plays this game so I have no idea if it's the same deal on Windows. Speaking of players, this is a perfect segue into my next and final point, the playerbase. This game would be kinda fun if you didn't take it too seriously. In fact, I wouldn't have refunded it for just those previous reasons, I probably wouldn't have even wasted my time with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review. But I did, and it's because NO ONE ♥♥♥♥ING PLAYS THIS and you shouldn't either.TL;DR: Like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ prophunt but with one prop, no players, god-awful controls, and hiding doesn't take any thought as everything in the map is the same.

The nonsense of the combat is always funny even if you die horribly and the suprise of thinking you have an enemy cornered only to have him jump over you and extend the battle makes it very random. Overall 7/10 because it has a limited map(the basic ground and area) rotationAddressing Negative Commentors:Most negative reviews mention lag and lack of players but i havent had either of those in my experience (the usual multiplayer low pop is only an issue mid day and early morning 4am to around about 3pm) The gamemodes are fun and the camping issues are ussually dealt with in game by a function allowing stickers to start appearing on youself if you sit still too long."

,Recommended,527340,33242310,Posted: 4 July,all,Wesley Woppits,"Don't be a square - buy this (but only if you have friends to play it with). It'll entertain your group for at least a couple of hours if you don't take it too seriously.It has your standard fare of FPS modes, (DM, TDM, CTF) but King of the Hill is the way to go on this one with the camping mode stickers disabled. Of course, you're gonna have that one friend who attacks every box to try to find you, but if the Hill is contested, it seems fair. One Bullet is also a neat mode. It's an InstaGib (the normal modes take 3 hits to kill, with 3 rounds in the clip and infinite reloads), but you only get one shot unless you get a kill, so then it's knife time!It can be played in First- or Third-Person, though I kind of wish it had an option to force first person for a given match.The other thing I wish it had is better match options. Currently you can set it to a match length of 1 to 10 minutes. I haaaate when games don't give you an option to set infinite time limits and just play to a set score instead. It's not that hard, is it? Setting it to infinite time? Like one more tick on the slider, or an entry field for how much time you want, with ""0"" being Unlimited, is that so taxing?Other than that... it's entertaining. Somewhat. Nothing super exciting, it doesn't have any of those real moments where you scream at the screen because something awesome just happened, but it'll do, pig. It'll do.PS: That guy crying about the framerate being trash is running it on a potato. Also, the movement takes getting used to, (for like 20 seconds), but it's fine. It's a cardboard box that has to hop around, did you expect it to slide across the floor?"

The graphics are great but the one thing which annoys the crap out of me is the spawn kills, the game play is great but that ticks me off real bad. The other thing to note this game is 100mb and something so it shouldn't be laggy. It lags sometimes for me. I do recommend this game its alot of fun even with friends"
