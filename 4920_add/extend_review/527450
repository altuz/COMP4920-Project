,Recommended,527450,25539217,"Posted: 16 September, 2016",all,[PSG] Howie,"EDIT: The dev listened and fixed almost all negative points I brought up. See the UPDATED tags after each paragraph to see what has improved. Thus, I changed the rating from negative to positive.I bought the game cause I thought it could be some crazy stupid fun. And hey, 5€ aren't that expensive I thought. So bought it for me and a friend and we jumped right into the game. Which greeted us with ""Made with Unity Personal"". Nothing wrong with using Unity, but it doesn't sound very professional to release with a personal edition.Anyway. Joining a server consists of waiting, since a public server joined using quickplay always requires 4 players. There were no player apparently however. So we waited. And waited. And random player BY1ON joined. And waited with us. And then after 5 minutes BY1ON left. And joined again cause apparently we were the only quickplay server.UPDATE: Dev fixed this by making a game start with at least 1 killer and 1 cockroach.So we got bored and left. Turns out font ""xxx with friends"" is actually a button to create a private server. Could have made that a bit clearer. So we joined our server and the game started. I was the killer. The killer apparently is a middle-aged obese man who really needs to work on his arm muscles. That's probably not healthy. Or he's an accountant, then that's normal. So I grabbed a plate and watched out for my cockroach pal. When I spotted him, I threw my deathplate at him, just to hit something entirely else cause there's no crosshair or any other indication where you are exactly aiming at. So I picked up a knife, threw it... Hit far off again. My buddy roach ate some healthy snacks in the meantime, starting to build an enormous egg on his tail.My buddy still visible under the table, I wanted to crouch and just smash him. Well, I can't cause our hero not only is weak as F***, he's also geriatric obviously and can't crouch at all.UPDATE: Dev added crouching.Chased him a bit more, all while he ran behind cupboards and the oven. And I heard him munching on the various food around which made me paranoidly trying to spot every movement around. At some point he even found a dead fly, which enabled him to fly around my head nagging me. I've got to admit, at that point the game was quite fun. But then I again tried to pick up stuff...Frustrated, I opened a few drawers and found my enemy inside, smashing him with a plate. Did I win now? Apparently not cause he respawned. How many time do I have to smash him? No idea, game doesn't say. How many eggs does he have to lay to win? THAT'S A SECRET DUH!UPDATE: Dev added visible counters for remaining lives.After a while, most of my weapons were strewn across the floor and our old man still can't crouch. But he can't pick up stuff from the floor also, or only very hard. It took a whole while to find the tiny spot where it let me pick up a can of bug spray. My friend hetched an egg meanwhile.UPDATE: Crouching also makes it possible/easier to pick up stuff from the floor.Well, and when I went to play cockroach I got frustrated even more. The controls are just bad. You can't sidestep and while you walk, you rapidly lose indication where you are cause the camera flips around like a child with ADHD on speed. Then we got stuck inside a thing to put bread in and stopped playing.All while we had to talk over steam chat, cause there's no in-game chat. At all. Neither text nor voice.UPDATE: Dev added chat.Let's sum this up since you didn't read the above anyway:Pro:- Good idea- Graphics are simple but funny- Game seems to be fun in-between the frustrating moments- Only 5€Cons (crossed out items are fixed):-Long wait time cause there are no players (might improve in the coming days)-Menu is weird-Needs score overlay to see who's actually winning and when-Needs ingame chat- Bad controls for cockroachers AND killer-Killer can't crouch-Killer can't reliable pick up stuff- Cockroach camera is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-Cockroaches get stuck easily- Cockroaches can't jump the tiniest gap, fall all the way down to the floor againSuggestions:- Improve killer controls: Give him a crosshair- Improve cockroach controls: Allow sidestep and do something with the camera so you don't lose orientation so easily. Allow jumping a short distance!TLDR: Dev adressed most of the downsides, except the nausea-inducing camera. However, the game is very well playable now. For only 5 bucks, go grab it for some fun with your pals!I will update the review if anything changes."

,Recommended,527450,29617382,Posted: 31 January,all,Sam,"Cons:-This game rewards the player for killing helpless cockroaches.-The cockroaches just want food and are punished.-The flying mechanic is unrealistic to how roaches actually fly.-Roaches run slower in this game than in real life. I would say they run 1.5-2mph in this game if the room if the proportions of the room are correct. The average roach can run about 3 miles per hour. I understand that they had to slow down the roaches to make the game balanced, but it makes the game a lot less immersive.-The cockroaches are overpowered. It is quite challenging to win as the humans.-The controls take some getting used to.-Soundtrack is a bit loud.Pros:-This is one of the best games where you are able to play as a cockroach.-Graphics are pretty nice.-The cockroach model is moderately accurate to what real roaches look like, aside from the erect antennas.-The roach roll is fun and will put a smile on your face.-The cockroach noises when flying are a nice touch, even if not completely accurate to how flying roaches sound.Improvements to be made:-Add the ability to choose different species of roaches to play as. I reccomend the oriental cockroach, madagascar hissing cockroach, and the brown-banded cockroach to start. There are 4,500+ species of cockroaches worldwide. Having only one available in game is silly.-Make a bigger area for the player to be in.-Add support for bigger games.-Add achievements!"

,Recommended,527450,25668894,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,twitch.tv/profanegames,"This game needs A LOT of work. It is an incredibly good concept and I can imagine it being a good laugh with a lot of friends playing, especially if there was some kind of position based voip. I can imagine cockroaches with a pitch modifier taunting the ""Man"".Bit disappointed that this is made in Unity, I mean its good engine but considering the size of the game as it currently stands I think something made in UE would be much more aesthetically pleasing and less buggy as there is only one room at the moment.As for the ""map"" or room that you play in, the size of it is frustratingly small. I understand if it was huge the game would be impossible for the Man to win, but the fact a cockroach can sit on the wall directly infront of you and be inaccessable by anything but throwing pots and pans around is frustrating, theres a crouch/crawl function now which is cool but  maybe there should be an option to climb onto a moveable footstool too.I feel that this game was something that was made over the weekend and I am unsure if it will go any further. Which is a shame as there seems to be a lot of potential and I hope the devs realise this.Animations need some work and the overall gameplay could be smoother.Its frustrating when you pick up an item and cannot open cupboards or drawers with it in your hand.Also... Cockroaches need a strafe...I could go on with few more things but I have wrote enough.Overall, a lot of potential, great concept but so so far from being finished."

,Recommended,527450,26181820,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,Zanderthaw,"Absolutley love this game! Great idea and very fun to play. I am already a sucker for simulation games but this one had a very unique feel about it. Although it is very easy to get disoriented as a cockroach I think it adds to the illusion that you're a tiny insect in a giant's world. Two things I don't like are how wonky the controls for the human are and the fact that not a lot of people play this game so it can be difficult to find a match. All said the game is good for the price, 7/10.- This review is an updated one. I made a review for this game last year and decided to update it."

That is WAAAY too small for it to be reliable, but to make things worst, its devided, so US will have around 12+ perday. EU will have 8, Japan will have 2, etc etc. So finding a server is difficult right now, there are times where its easy to find a server, and there are times where no one is playng or there are no open games. Besides that, the game itself is pretty amazing. You are a cute tiny cockroach and you need to make babies while an annoying hooman tries to kill you and your baby."

The controllers are laggy, choppy animations and the hitboxes are way off and random. If this was a free game made in 24 hrs I would understand but for $5 I would not recommend this game. I refunded and we tried our best to have fun but it wasn't there. Cool concept but poorly executed."
