I wish I was exaggerating.-	This is too short to be a game it feels like a demo-	Game has Bad Controls and doesn’t introduce them properly-	Controls are too sensitive which makes the screen rotation headache worse and there is no setting to adjust-	Bad English translation-	Menu selection is weird why couldn’t the blue arrow on the main menu be used for all the menus instead of using different ways to show currently selected option.-	In the intro if your using the controller it still gives you the Mouse + Keyboard controls instead of the controller layout.-	Hit box for the character is just insane. You ‘stop’ facing a wall, turn and then your fat♥♥♥♥♥or sides hit the wall and your dead.-	Doesn’t explain anything well I was so confused and the trial and error plus constant migrane only helped in breaking my controller.-	Why are the game achievements in Russian and not you know your steam language setting?"

,Recommended,527480,31248187,Posted: 19 April,all,Pirate :),"I wish there was a mixed option.I enjoyed the game despite it's 10 minutes of in-game time total. The actual gameplay is extremely easy and the story, obviously, isn't a real reason to considering the game is only 10 minutes.But it's only one dollar, so if you have extra money in your steam wallet this is a fun way to waste ten minutes real quick.AND actually (if you take interest in speedrunning) this game would be pretty interesting to see a run of considering it's rolling mechanic for the beetle levels (makes you go super fast)"

If that stuff bothers you, you might wanna skip this. I would NOT call this a scary game, but I would call it a bit uneasy/weird. I thought the theme was pretty interesting.The game's (english) writing isn't its strong point. The developer(s?) is Russian, so some of the verbs aren't where they are supposed to go and there's a lot of articles missing. It's endearing as all getout and kind of a bonus for me, but I'm willing to bet the writing in Russian itself is decent.The gameplay is tricky, but not hard. I've seen a few other folks say that the game is unplayable because the controls are bad. Here's a quick pro-tip: Use the arrow keys instead of the mouse. I honestly do not feel like the game was developed for the mouse, as it's very clunky and hard to control. With the arrow keys, the game becomes an interesting mix of fast reflexes and basic problem solving.Also, the beetle doesn't move forward indefinitely. If you press the down arrow, he'll stop, and everything freezes. If you press up, he chargerolls forward to manuver around enemies to safer areas. It's tricky, but not hard. I completed the game and got all the achievements in about 25 minutes.Yes, the game is short. I paid $0.25USD for it with a cupon, but I would say that the game is worth the $0.99 the developer is asking for. You DO get trading cards and achievements for this game, which is a huge bonus.TO THE DEVELOPER:I loved your game, and I sincerely hope that you expand on it in the future. You may want to hire an English writer to help you. I would love to see some additional levels. Thank you for bringing this to steam!"

76561198086542708,Recommended,527480,31232770,Posted: 19 April,all,UnimaginativeHandle,"It's good but for a game that is about 10-15 minutes (depending on if you botch the one hard screen as many times as I did) it has a few bugs, but not a deal breaker if you like nicely designed short games with a good soundtrack.- The first screen is a language select, if I press Enter on English which is the default cursor position then the game does nothing; if I press right to go to Russian & then press left & Enter to select English, then it works.- The Bug levels (where the store says you have indirect control by turning the space, but you have that & also an accelerate & a fire button in two stages, so indirect isn't true) have an onscreen instruction that you press Left Mouse Button to accelerate, you don't, you press the Up Arrow.- In a later Bug level you fire from a turret with the Up Arrow & then you have to press Middle Mouse Button to exit the turret which would be fine if accelerate/fire was actually Left Mouse Button, so my hand would have a reason to be on the mouse but the first issue with the Left Mouse Button on screen prompt & this Middle Mouse to exit instead of Z (action for the person stages) or the something like Down Arrow just make me think that the controls were redesigned during development to be keyboard only but not redesigned properly.- The Achievements are all in Cyrillic, in the 15 minutes of gameplay I got 6 of 7 achievements but I have no idea why or how to get the last one.Those flaws are quite fixable in this Early Access period. I liked what I got to play; I hope that the full release is longer & not just this but polished because it is quite short, but it is also $1aud; so maybe 10 minutes of content with little replay value but polished is okay for $1; but it's more that I liked what I played, so I wish there was more of it even if it were more expensive rather than griping over a short game for $1, just feels like it starts introducing new mechanics & then it's done, which is a shame more than anything.We'll see, worth picking it up if 'you rotate the world' games are your thing or if you like taking a chance on maybe getting more content in decent Early Access stuff."

,Not Recommended,527480,32366426,Posted: 12 June,all,CL1504,Pretty poor game. Music and sounds play way too loud and you can't turn the volume down in the game. Alt-Tabbing doesn't work so you have to get task manager through CTRL-ALT-DELETE which will throw you onto the desktop and let you turn it down. But that only works 1/2 the time. The On/Off buttom for sounds doesn't work and the gameplay is mediocre. Glad I only spent £0.08 on this or I would be very annoyed...

,Recommended,527480,32048907,Posted: 29 May,all,apmbskh,"I am not entirely sure about what Life Beetle’s story is about but I suppose it is open to interpretation. This quick, cheap game does not need a story as the main focus is gameplay. I completed this game within 10 minutes (the additional time on my record was to collect cards).I encountered no bugs and the soundtrack is decent. Unfortunately, the characters’ text seems to be mistranslated and therefore sometimes difficult to understand what’s going on. This, however, does not stop you from completing the game and walking away with very reachable achievements."
