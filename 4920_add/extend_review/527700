The reloading mechanics and having a friend cover you all provides great gameplay stories and presence. I played for about an hour with two VR newbies and we had a blast. Keep on refining this game- I think you're on to something unique with the zombie shooter genre. Could use some polish graphically, but I also really like the enemy variety and their distinct animations. Looking forward to more development!"

(Only 1 gun, only one vantage point, etc)VR player has a limited character model.Only allowed one weapon at a time on missionsThis game is fun especially with 2 players,but adding a character model would bump the production value up a ton. Even if it's just a Military Helmet and some glovesDev has now re-added the helmet back into the game :) . I'd also love to be able to bring 2 weapons on mission with me (maybe reaching over shoulder and hitting grip buttons could switch weapons?)Looking forward to future updates on this game."

It’s not just a simple hit of a button to reload, so you have to have a basic knowledge of how to actually use a gun.  It takes a few attempts to get the hang of the system, but I think it makes it more rewarding and immersive. I’d recommend the game if you’re looking for a cheap shooter, as it’s defiantly worth the asking price."

It gives you exactly what the description on the ""box"" describes, hordes of zombies with realistic weapons and reload mechanisms.Also, heavy metal music while shooting the undead makes this game all the more frantic and fun ;)* addition, a few days ago 0.8 came out..It's amazing. Full locomotion and realistic weapon handeling. I love the way this developer just has fun making something cool and special."

Lot's of upgrades and different challenges, they recently added ground support for the non VR player, which is awesome (I would love to see more gun options there).

This is one of those that does not necessarily awe you with stunning graphics and effects – although it's engine is clean and sharp – but grasps you with its gameplay that keeps pulling me back.This is no arcade experience with meaningless weapons such as some other VR zombie shooters, but as said earlier it has gorgeous detailed real weapons in the game and their reloading mechanics. This mechanic sets the difficulty tone and makes it fun to master the weapon and rule the scene once you do.This is a game in progress as the early access suggests, however there are frequent updates and the developers is very friendly and open for suggestions. The price is right and fair too, so what are you doing still reading this? Get it, it's good ;)"

If you are like myself and have a player two and you dig the asymmetrical multiplayer thing this is a good game for that.High praises to the Dev, super active in the discussion bored, and very open to suggestions/ideas to help improve the game."
76561198117719567,Recommended,527700,30097297,Posted: 22 February,all,SoundandPicture,"This game is truly unique among current VR offerings. The local multiplayer is a blast! So far, I've played two great sessions of the asymmetric co-op with friends. We only stopped the first time because of an excessive headset perspiration situation. Honestly it is some of the most rewarding co-op gameplay I've experienced.Initially it felt like the PC sniper player was only moderately useful, as the first sniper weapon is a bit underpowered and slow with limited ammo. Then we started to use the additional vantage point to act as a spotter in addition to a sniper. With the PC player calling out warnings to the VR player of incoming zombies and their locations, we started to succeed a lot more. We developed our own short hand for the most potent enemies (crawlers, joggers, runners, and big guys) to help the VR player deal with the most imminent threats first. Once we unlocked the .50 cal sniper and all other sniper perks, the co-op mode really came into its own. The PC player started to make a big contribution to the success or failure of each mission.The risk/reward exfiltration mechanic makes for seriously tense action and it only gets better when combined with the timed survival challenges. Waiting a full minute for that chopper to arrive while starting to get overrun by the horde makes for close calls, bitter defeats, and ultimately victories that feel earned.Really looking forward to seeing development on this game progress! In particular I'm hoping for more end game content and progression. The challenges that give extra rewards for each level are a great start, I'd love to see more specific challenges added as we've moved through the existing ones pretty quickly. I'd also like to see the spotter role of the PC player expanded as call outs were some of the most fun we had with the game. One idea is for the PC player to have an onscreen timer, so they can call out time to the VR player (who is frankly too busy to look at the timer on the crate in those tense end of match moments). Harder versions of the existing maps that unlock after completing the challenges would be great as well.Totally worth the price as is, but I hope the developers stick with this one for a while. Mainly for purely selfish reasons, as I just want more of this to play."

Only complaint is that from playing Brookhaven, I've gotten used to the grip button as reload mechanism. Also, using the hand grip buttons in CI, I always accidentally drop my gun whenever I jump at a zombie behind me.Would it be possible to switch the buttons so grip button drops the maganize and thumbpad picks up / drops things?Either way, really fun game."

I try and click on various add-on purchases in the home screen (light, medkit, etc) and nothing happens. Once, it even crashed at that point. In the game itself, the shooting isn't as good as it could be (hit mechanics for headshot etc) and, the deal breaker for me, the hit detection with the side weapon is the worst yet. I was swinging the axe-type weapon from side to side with a zombie on top of me, chomping away, and - nothing happened! This was the case in all of the games that I tried. Not for me."

You can't just blast away, there's abundant ammo but you have to eject and reload each clip, pulling back to chamber the first round if there's not already one one in the spout. If things get too hectic you can take the points you've earned (cash to buy better weapons) and press a button to exit. But you have to wait for extraction so need to plan for that too.Can imagine this will get really twitchy on harder levels, fumbling around after leaving it too late to reload as some of those scampering zombies come at you at night. Good game and original spin on the genre at this price."

,Recommended,527700,25709739,"Posted: 26 September, 2016",all,popkorn95,"Easily one of the most fun Zombie shooters I've played. Probably the most adrenaline pumping one since Left4Dead!Containment Initiative is a refreshing spin on a classic genre, with a gameplay that focuses strongly on the way you use your gun.It requires quite a bit of motoric skill with the controllers to handle those advanced weapon mechanics, but that's a plus, as it results in an extra rewarding experience once you've mastered the basic learning curve, which took me about 30 minutes of play.After that the game could start to feel slightly repetitive, but it makes up for it with an entertaining ""risk and reward""-system that makes you want to push your limits and survive as long as you possibly can to earn more credits, so you can buy better guns and equipment as soon as possible.I've had a couple issues with the controller button layout feeling a bit unintuitive, but the developer seems incredibly engaged in delivering on the potential that this experience has to offer, listening to player feedback and pushing out updates on an impressively high frequency, atm.I can wholeheartedly recommend this game, especially for people who still enjoy a decent Zombie scenario.It's more than worth buying into early access at it's current development stage, because it's already packed with a couple hours of super mindless fun!If you have a couple bucks to spare, what are you waiting for? :D"

But...This is by no means worth the asking price... The overall gameplay is extremely dry; this honestly feels like a cash grab of a title...However..... If the devs do plan on carrying on with updates and making this a better game, it will have my undying support as I do see a lot of potential, but this feels like it should be Early Access...Would I recommend this game?... No, unless you really enjoy the thought of coop with 2 players on 1 PC, in which case.. Depends.."

,Not Recommended,527700,32736643,Posted: 24 June,all,STEREO,"This game is a joke.  Granted it's only $7 right now, but for just about $1 more you could get a game like Bullets and More, that is literally 10+ times the size of this game and is actually done well.  I appreciate the dev's attempt at this game, but it's a swing and a miss in my opinion.Here is a list of things I didn't like about the game: game mechancis like reloading are horrible (the gun practically has to give birth to the magaine to eject it), there actually might be no locomotion or control options whatsoever (I couldn't find any), only 2 of the 6 or 7 levels actually let you walk around (extremely slowly), the missions are dumb, pointless, and boring as hell, and the only reason there even are that many maps is because some are day and some are night but they're the same boring maps, what tiny little amounts of story there are make no sense whatsoever, the game is STUPID EASY (unlocked all weapons in 3 games and never died once), the dev obviously knows very little about guns because the weapon mechanics are wrong on some of the weapons (example: mk18 charging handle kicks back with every shot LMFAO), none of the weapons I used kicked at all (assuming none do), so even though you can 2-hand a rifle, there's no point, the weapon sights are HORRIBLE (like looking at little LCD screens with a reticle painted on, instead of an actual sight), there is very little attention to detail in the majority of the game (especially the ""operation trailer"" or whatever it is where you spawn into the wall if you're standing in the middle of your play space, the weapon scale looks wrong for some guns in the operations trailer (although i didn't handle every weapon because this game can't keep my attention that well), weapon options are very limited (I think there were 6 guns), the operations trailer has all sorts of weird invisible surfaces that not only look crappy but also make launching the mission annoying.Things I liked about the game:  The 1911 sound is pretty goodAll in all, I definitely don't recommend this game, especially considering what other games are out there for a similar price.  If you want to do some hardcore zombie slaying buy Dead Effect (all zombie slaying) or Bullets and More (includes zombie slaying).To the dev:  I'm not going to ask you for a refund because it seems you probably need my $7 more than I do.  However, if you would like some advice on how to make your game astronomically better, start by addressing the thigns I've listed here.  When you complete that, let me know and I will find more things for you to fix in your game.  lol"

It uses your real life movement and I guess some other wizardy and you just go sprinting off even while standing still trying to open a box. Oh you think you can swing and hit a zombie?

,Recommended,527700,28996847,Posted: 3 January,all,50shots-1kill (Corpsemaker),"---Update---Dev has continued to work on his game and has been very responsive to community feedback.  I recommend purchasing this game if only to support an awesome and open dev.  I would love to see what he can do with more support!This game has a great premise, a scout searching for loot and his buddy providing overwatch.  The execution however falls painfully short.I began as the player in VR.  A few of the shortcomings I noticed immediately are:The menu system and level select inside of the helicopter are horrible.  Super clunky, ugly and extremely basic (looks like someones first game)The sound was nothing special just slightly irritating.Graphics are definitely poor quality overall, especially the level architecture.When I switched over to the PC some of the issues I had were:The sensitivity is not adjustable so I was trying to adjust it via the DPI on my mouse but this seems like a poor solution.You are fixed in a static location so on the scavenge map you cannot cover the player in many locations, seems like a more fleshed out PC experience could include moving to other locations as well as scavenging for more ammunition.Speaking of ammunition, you only get 35 rounds as the sniper.  Once you are out you can't do anything beyond watching the other player.There are no reloading sounds or boly cycling sounds so it's kind of a guess as to when your next round is chambered and when you will be able to fire again.I am overall disappointed with this game and I hope that more time is put into it.  I REALLY like the idea of a co-op game with one person in VR and the other on the PC."
