76561198081757333,Recommended,527710,26176103,"Posted: 22 October, 2016",all,Without Redemption,"Was thinking of how I'd write up a review for this game.  I could talk about how the music, while not enthralling, does not bore. That the graphics and design are better than many other games with a larger price tag. I could talk about how not controlling your fighters directly during a fight leads to tense moments and fist pumps when you snatch victory from the teeth of defeat with less than ten health.  I could even talk about how I got emotionally attached to one gladiator and was sad to see her go after we talked in depth about the God of death and mysteries for months in game while she curb-stomped anyone I sent her up against, then felt elated after she wanted to stay on with me even after she won her freedom.instead, I'll just keep striking home the point that, for the price advertised, this may be the best game of it's type on steam or elsewhere.Four dollars.Four dollars for a game that engrossed me enough within the first twenty minutes to take a day off from work just  play through.Four dollars for some pretty spiffy fluff in the form of Lorebooks acquired in game that were actually entertaining enough to read.Four dollars for a gladiator management simulator that includes marriage options, assiting different factions in side stories, full stories for every fighting slave you can purchase that they share with you.Four dollars for a game that had me restart five or six times after the initial few hours of playing just to try and see if I could optimize my start or just to change my portrait one last time when I did find how I wanted to start. (Sound familiar fans of Bethesda's Fallout or Elder scrolls games?)Give it a shot. After all......It's only four dollars."
,Not Recommended,527710,29378266,Posted: 20 January,all,Jernfalk,"I bought this game using a 75% discount cupon that I got. Enough said, I spent less than a dollar on it.I marked it as ""Received for free"" because after selling all the cards I got, I had a profit of more than I paid for the game, meaning I basically was paid to play, still wouldn't justify my ""Yes"" for a recommendation.The game's idea isn't bad. In fact, the idea is pretty great. However the execution of it is lacking at best.THE PROS:- Easy to learn gameplay with tour around all the possible buildings you can get;- Being able to socialize and learn your fighter's histories, even tho the fighters are randomized;- Cheap.THE CONS:- Horrible interface, lacking important information;- Hard to keep track of everything, which could be attributed to the interface problem;- No control over which fights are available each week;- No control over your fighters during combat and no option to skip or hasten combat animation is given, leading to you watching the same attack animation for 10 minutes until you either win or lose;-No secondary means of getting money, which combined to the lack of control over everything else means that losing two fights in a roll usually means you'll go bankrupt and get a ""game over"";Overall, I like the concept and if this is the developer's first attempt at making a full, proper game I am obliged to congratulate him on the effort, for I too am a programmer and know how hard it can be. However, it could be so much more than what it is if you dedicated more time to making the hud and giving some more power of control to the player. Until that is done, I'll have to give it a ""No""."

Set about 300 years after the prior game, this game deals with another age of turmoil where someone lower on the social ladder might be able to rise up and reach new heights... through managing the arena.The gameplay is somewhat similar, so you simply equip your fighters, help their morale, and set them loose in tournaments. There are also events that happen from time to time."

You can upgrade your estate, equip your fighters with weapons and armor and the back story for your slave fighters is a very nice touch and adds an excellent layer of depth for a game thats only $4. I recommend this to anyone who is looking to enjoy a light intensity game with a lot of cool little novelties. If you like choose your own adventure books, old school 90's story lines in the genre of dragon warrior ( not an adventure game, you manage you don't fight yourself) and have always wanted to run your own gladiator house after watching spartacus but have found like I have that all the other gladiator games suck, then this is for you. Enjoy the game.Longer Extended Version of my review.....THis game is one of those games that save gaming. With the market flooded with thousands of worthless titles that are unfinished, broken and uninteresting this is a breath of fresh air. Its unique, has a good story. Let me repeat that, this has a good story. So for 4 dollars, you can buy a nacho supreme at taco bell and be done in 5 minutes, you could buy civ 6 for 60 dollars and be done in 5 minutes because you remember that civ 5 was onlty great after 3 expansions.What you get for your 4 dollars is actual entertainment, with a well thought out story, you get some choices and you get exposed to a new game world that you get to take part in....that you are indeed raising your repuation and trying to move your house up in the world.Please disregaurd the negative reviews, I'll tell you exactly what happens, people who play this see the potential, of the game, of the features, of the world created, and they go off on how it doesnt have this, it doesnt have that,.........i remind everyone two things, perfect is the enemy of good......this is a good game and you defintely get what you are paying for.....Like everyone else who plays this, you will be excited about the world and the possibilities for the future, so lets make sure when we talk to the devs we explain it that way and give them a chance for expansions.  ( no way a criticism of the game, like I said...its good and you get what you pay for...)I too have a lot of excitment about the possibilities of what could be done with this or another title, I just recognize that hey, for 4 dollars this is a great entry into this world, and i sincerely hope they do some dlc or another game of this sytle, like everyone else i have a million ideas but i wont list them here, because this review is about this game, and its a good game. So join me in this world and let your friends know, so we can get another game from these people, if anyone deserves to create another game, in this genre or another new ideas, its these guys, They did a damn good job on this game and I would of paid more, the 4 dollar price point doesnt do it justice."
,Recommended,527710,31095806,Posted: 12 April,all,Aureus,"I find it difficult to judge this game and I think it deserves a rating such as 6/10. It's cheap and small (takes 6 hours to beat it) and just as the other games of its creators: rather unique.In this RPG Maker game you are not a warrior grinding your way to power through mazes and bad RPG Maker battles. Instead you are a noble person trying to organize a group of slave-gladiators and to use them during on various arenas to become a powerful and rich part of high-class community of kings, princessess and famous knights. You don't have to hold a sword on your own even once. I think that's pretty neat and the idea definitely is appealing to me.However, the game is very easy and even though it has a lot of interesting mechanics and a huge potential, it's hard to put your heart into all this since the game lacks challange and variety. Some of the ideas feel more like a chore than a fun tool to make the game more amusing.I'll give you an example. The game allows you to hire up to 4 warriors (slaves-gladiators) what requires a lot of management and resources. However, you can bit the game using only the first two warriors your gain for free. The game has a complex ""morale system"" - the higher morale your gladiators have, the better income they provide, and having bad morale makes them want to attempt escaping from you (I guess). They are losing morale by losing fights and whenever you are bankrupt, but since the game allows you to receive a huge income and gives you many ways to keep the gladiator's moral as high as possible without much effort, all of this is pointless.The biggest problem though is the fact that you can only ""prepare"" your warriors for the arena fights and during the duels you have no way to interact with the fighters at all. You can only watch them using their cheap animations and sounds to punch each other with some RNG rolls to decide who is going to win. After some time I started to just read Facebook on my phone while the game was fighting ""for me"" in the background.Thankfully the story and characters are very decent and there are a lot of surprises when you try to manage your estate. You have an actual impact on the politics of the realms around you and some of the NPCs are pretty colorful (and have interesting backstories) and you have to carefully think when do you want to brownnose some rich duche or maybe instead stay honest and/or loyal to someone. Some parts of the game are pritty grim (prostitution, slavery, corruption) while the others are rather light-hearted and even funny.I'm glad I played this game but you should definitely think about giving it a shot. If you are not a part of its target audience, you are not going to enjoy it."

,Recommended,527710,26581693,"Posted: 13 November, 2016",all,Royal Rambler,"This game is beyond awesome. It has SO much potential. I didn't think it would be my thing, because strategy games usually aren't my cup of tea, but I thoroughly enjoyed Crown Champion: Legends of the Arena.Though technically this is a management SIM, and this seems to be up my alley after all.If the game were to be tweaked periodically it could grow into something bigger & better for sure!There's so much to say about Crown Champion I don't even know where to start.As the player you find yourself playing as a Slave Manager. With that comes an estate (in a decrepit state), which you buy & renovate & expand as you make a name for yourself - battle, after battle.Every few weeks a slave ship anchors by the port, so you are given the opportunity to buy more slaves (NB currently the max. allowed amount to manage is 4 slaves at once).At the onset of the story (while the game mechanics are explained by your own personal steward/assistant), you're prompted to take part into locally organized battles at an alehouse, nearby.It's interesting to note slaves actually do look different (i.e. skin tone, hair, gender). Their personal stats are slightly different as well (even if they belong to the same class).They each have their story which is revealed match after match (when they're addressed by you in their cells).Each slave needs a cell to sleep, and additional slaves can only be purchased after building extra cells (one starts with 2 cells & 2 slaves at first and thru progression 2 additional cells can be built).There's a total of 6 battle classes slaves belong to:- The Bear class (exclusively male berserker'ish fearless skullbashers; specialize in high dmg)- The Warrior class (speaks for itself - balanced fighters)- The Blade class (I expected to see a type of fencing expert here wielding longer swords exclusively, but they felt like a mix between Warrior & Fox - having the former's brawl, and the latter's swiftness, with lesser DEF & HP - quite overpowered if you ask me)- The Shadow class (rogue-ish, with a brawly twist) - this class is exclusively female and they tackle the heck out of you like a seasoned rugby player)- The Fox class (rogue-ish, like an assassin - mad evasion & critical strikes - the opposition traumatized me several times while hurling their throwing stars)- The Tower class (tank-ish - mine were useful at first though rather slow & dull, whereas the opposing factions' Towers were badass, because they absorbed damage, upped their defense & counter-attacked like hell and they usually charged into my fighters like a true Spartan soldier at the most inconvenient times)The parameters per character include:- attack points (determine how well a character can inflict damage)- defense (determines how well a character can reduce the impact of a blow = less HP lost)- agility (see note below)- reflexes (see note below)- endurance aka hitpoints (= lifebar aka total HP per char.)NB agility & reflexes I believe are supposed to determine the evasion rate, critical hit rate & attack speed rate per character (but this honestly seems unclear and inaccurate in-game, I noticed a tiny bit of difference as I leveled these, but not much)As a slave handler, one is free to buy whichever class one wants (I had a strong preference for Blades, Warriors & Bears because these seemed to be more well-rounded than the other classes if you know how to equip them).NOTE: I have noticed how whichever slave is best suited for battle depends a lot on the opposing faction's champion's lvl, stats & gear. Sometimes none of my champs were a good fit, and then I found myself needing to sell a slave in order to progress.My biggest champ right from the get-go was a Bear. Boy did that guy spam Rage attack (high dmg!) - uff! Though my Crown Champion  (= the one winning the Royal Championship at the end of the game) was a Blade :). OP I tell ya!NOTE: after replaying the game a 2nd time around, I've come to realize my Bear was a champ, because I consistently kept his 'morale' (= confidence level) up, by rewarding him.When chatting with slaves, one needs to be mindful of the response given to any comment made by the slave in question, because that can make or break a slave's morale - so does losing matches (sometimes it's better to withdraw!).NB it is advised to save often! It's easy to go bankrupt in this game!------------------------------What I liked & felt satisfied about:- the class system + their respective weapons & armor (although I'd love to see more variations of weapons & armor)- the money management system (at times it felt really tight, but as I progressed I made money more easily due to other forms of money-making being introduced - other than competing against other fighters)What I missed and would have liked:- seeing accurate battle stances & proper wielding of weaponry by fighters- a more apparent difference in weight/swiftness depending on type of armor equipped (per fighter)- re-building the purchased estate from the ground up (including an accurate visual representation of the so-called decrepit state when first starting out)- character portrets for Kings/Queens (in library books - I am more inclined to read and follow up on the lore if I can see what a character looks like, otherwise it feels like reading about ghosts to me, and I have a hard time memorizing who's who)- a more sophisticated map (with distinct visual differences per area on the map - the way it is now, it looks rather flat, dull & uninspiring)What annoyed me:- the broken battle system (i.e. unnecessary repetition of buffs/debuffs & tricks - I've witnessed some ridiculous matches; it was so bad I chuckled a good couple of times)- so-called (invisible) sponsors (i.e. only mentioned thru text - no visual cue in the form of a character/representative) having interest in my faction, but only wanting to invest in a specific upgrade or expansion of the estate imposed by them (the game felt rather 'forced' in this regard - I welcome investments, but I'd rather decide where the money goes :p)- not seeing how much gold I had at any given time (directly on screen - I had to go into the menu for that each & every time)- no visual indication of whatever week it was in the game (which would make the seasonal sales in-game more meaningful), it would be nice to see some sort of notification so as to warn the player of when the next sale season is about to take place (it's quite annoying when buying weaponry & armory at full price, only to find out the sales period was right around the corner - d'oh!)- the inability to scroll thru character profiles swiftly (so as to check their parameters), and having to click back to the main menu screen, and select every profile individually (quite time-consuming!)What I would like to see implemented:- a customizable tabard (i.e. colour, battle crest), it would be neat if it could be bought (e.g. after winning a few matches, and beating the local champion at the alehouse - seems like a plausible and fair prerequisite)- having control over when a special attack is launched, through some kind of timed clicking mechanism (that would be nice!), and a strict limit as to how many times such an attack is allowed per match is really necessary to keep it balanced & playable- restricting the option for slaves to learn skills that traditionally belong to other classes (I do like the idea of battle style customization, but not the way it is now, it is way too liberal and quite a joke - especially the high dmg special attacks)- choice of estate type + upgrade/expansion (without them being a condition to progressing in game)- slaves can be rewarded in game - I'd like to actually *see* the rewards (i.e. sheepskin for bed, tattoo, engravement for weapon, etc., ... )- a large wall sign with the name of the house engraved in it + customizable heraldic banner as wall decoration"

,Recommended,527710,26356420,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,Fauxy,"Basically, this game isMonster Rancherwith slave trade, where your slaves becoming free is the equivalent of monsters dying of old age. It's quite an engrossing RPG-management sim mashup with surprising polish in its presentation, the lore of both the world and the 18 preset slaves that you can acquire, and the depth of the actual class-based arena combat gameplay. Surprising because, well, it costs almost nothing and I squeezed a good 14 hours out of it.Mostof which was enjoyable.The big flaw is that unlikeMonster Rancher, there's no concept of instruction or obedience. The arena fights which your slaves compete in are, after applying whatever equipment and training you've given them, completely RNG-based. You do not get to tell them what to do. This gets incredibly frustrating towards the end because you're basically forced to either save scum or grind ridiculous amounts when your fighter manages to miss every hit, or refuses to use any of his/her special attacks (all of which from all classes are exponentially better than the basic attacks), or spams a useless low level buff, or in the case of one class I've deemed to be the absolute worst, throw sand in the enemies eyes repeatedly hoping that making the AI's RNG worse will somehow kill them.Of course, at the very end, you get the ability to purchase for your slaves different skills from all classes, which allows you to break the balance and pretty much steamroll the final tournament if you've figured out which skills certain classes need to overcome their weaknesses to other classes, and which skills are simply overpowered. I didn't reroll any of the matches leading up to the final fight, and rerolled the actual final fightonce.The minor flaws are that it seems that the characters are made with software used for weird 3D modeled porn. I don't mind personally, but I imagine some people will think less of it for that. Plus the control scheme is weird, because it's trying to be mouse based but it's built on RPG Maker.Also, take this as you will, but it's not particularly grim for a game about slavery. The slaves are pretty polite and unusually willing to talk about their sad lives, considering the fact that you literally bought them like cattle and are keeping them in cages.Reading back, it sounds like I don't recommend this game but I do. Because I have a boner for gladiators. But also because it was for the most part an engaging and fun experience. There's a lot about it that seems underdeveloped, and as I said at the start, it's suprisingly polishedfor a game with this price tag.It's not a bad type of game though, if ever there was a sequel to finish the story I wouldn't want it to become a real turn-based RPG or something like that."

,Recommended,527710,29460337,Posted: 24 January,all,JohnnyRamrod,"ONE THUMB UPThis is a bit of fun. At the right price (which it is) this is worth it. It's a simple gladiator owner simulation game. By simple, read: not too many options and things to manage or do, a few different classes, and a couple of choices. Also, that means easy to play casually, spend a bit of time on, then go away - and come back later.If you want a deep strategy or sim game on running a gladiator house, then this ain't it. And don't be fooled by the 'Turn-Based' tag - that's not a good tag really. Combat auto-resolves, which tournament you fight in isn't up for choice etc. It's more simple than that.And with only 1 resource to manage (gold) and it being easy to set up a good team, there isn't much depth.On top of that, there's bit of RNG anger in the fights at times (given they auto-resolve so you don't get to do anything strategic other than pick which fighter to use).But, it's still  a decent game. Casual, fun, easy to play, and an ok kinda story.It's not a two thumbs up game, but for this price and a bit of entertainment, it's worth one thumb up."

If you enjoy simulation / RPG games this is a must buy.Review. This a good combination of Simulation / RPG gaming. You train slaves as fighters, each having their own backstory / desires. You make a lot of decisions along the way that allow you to help or hurt different sides of the kingdom. The story is good and you will read all the text and make your decisions carefully because it matters. The game has a lot of great systems in place, including upgrading your estate, equipment, and training / hiring staff. It's easy to learn and a lot of fun.

Then you start out with two slaves and room for just two gladiatorial slaves.  I'm not sure how much procedural generation is involved here if any, but it appears the personalities that are in game are fixed.  You fight characters in different locations around a quaintly drawn map, while your character on the map is only represented by a torchlike glow and not a sprite.  Kinda weird, but whatever.  It's the gameplay that matters.I have to admit it's kind of fun and suspenseful watching your fighters go at it.  You'll feel dread when they fail, and elation or boredom when they win, depending on how weak or strong they are, respectively.  You don't control the fighters while they're at it.  They'd only get distracted by your yammering anyways.The writing is of high quality, and it's genuinely interesting to hear about the background of your gladiatorial slaves.  And what I've seen of the main story is well-crafted as well. The interplay between your character and npcs is an interesting element that's not often explored in japanese styled rpgs such as this.You get dialogue options, for one thing, that lets you hang your own personal twists on your master's personality, and also affects the way you interact with the slaves.  They may like your character more or less after conversations, based on your choices there.  So it's a true roleplaying game in that dialogue choices have an actual affect on gameplay, which is rare enough in triple A games let alone small games such as this.This is just a quick first impressions review, I'll probably edit it more later as I get further into the game, but for the hour I've played, this seems like a really good buy for the price.  I'd give it a recommend."

I mean there is nothing in this game, you could do the same game with 10% of the load.You play a house that trains slaves into gladiators, but once your house has a lot of popularity and prestige, you should have problems with competitors, have visits from local lords who would want to be your friend (some might be really there for that, others just to profit from you), you should be able to run small fights in your house's yard or something, when you have communicated with kings and queens, you should get visit from envoys with request or offers to buy champions from you, etc.So many things are missing in this game that it is very unfortunate.Don't buy unless you want to be looking at a screen with little to do then watch your computer fight itself.

Equipment makes or breaks your advancement far more than the level of the slave fighters."

I'll just add that I'd love to see the concept fleshed out into a larger more robust title with better graphics.  I'd call this a wonderful proof of concept that's good for 10-15 hours of gameplay and it left me wanting more.

Great job team.8/10 as a game7/10 in mechanics, some need to be worked on. You can't really tell what reflexes and agility actually do for you, numbers wise (a page that opens and explains it when you click on a stat would solve that nicely), and the game really needs a battle speed up. Otherwise all of the mechanics are enjoyable. Maybe a money bonus from the first tournament would give you more starting gold without giving it to you all at once at the beginning, because money seems a little tight at first.9/10 based on the kind of game the developers were going for. Remarkably polished for such a cheap game."

The Dev could have easily put in half as much effort and charged three times as much and I would still have been satisfied with this purchase.  For a look at the game please check out:https://youtu.be/9c95FFi54iQThe game plays exactly as described, is easy to pick up and learn but gets more complex as the game evolves.  Most interesting is that there is a STORY to this game, as well, and the player has options on how to deal with various fighters and leaders which lead to different outcomes.  Every fighter has a personal story of some sort that fleshes them out as more than just stats."

I view it as a game you'd play when you're on the road or traveling with a tablet/laptop. The mechanics of balancing cost of fighters vs needing them to win to progress is satisfying and I felt like I was actually managing a stable of gladiators. The character development is good and the conversation choices are not easily discernable as ""good/neutral/bad"" and I enjoyed deciding whether I was trying to pander to my fighter or choosing an ethical response.Why the negative response? Because, for the way the game looks and runs, it should be no issue to run it on a mediocre laptop and yet it crashes to desktop without warning just about every other turn. I feels like there are memory leaks and the game walks, rather than runs, its way through animations and loading into new weeks when it doesn't crash. There is a gem of a little game in here, hobbled by CtDs and what feels like poor optimization."

Sure, graphics are exactly what you'd expect, the interface is clumsy at best and some vital information is either well hidden or missing completely, but writing is good and fighting completely automated - much to my delight, as I am rather tired of battling rats, spiders, drowners, dragons and you name it.  (There are no dragons here, just a lot of talk about them.) I played the game for 14 hours (I always play RPGs as slowly as possible) and only the last hour or so felt a bit grindy. It is possible to play on after the end but I don't think I will; I might restart it, though, to play as an utterly rotten character.In short, it's unexpensive but not cheap. And I do wonder what will happen next. Maybe I'll even get to see my (ingame) wife again."

I haven't had time to test everything in depth but the most concerning issues have been fixed, so I adjusted this to a thumbs up without any regrets.Prosyour slaves (total of 18, I assume 9 males, 9 females) have a unique story which you gradually explore (that means, some talking chapters with background info, not much more, but for a small game like this it really adds flavour and you will like some characters or dislike them)all the customizations to your household have a noticable effect (i.e. if you have a scribe and buy the trainer manual, training will be more effective)lots of lore behind all the counties, it really feels like a living, breathing worldmoney: at first it seems money is really hard to get and you have to sacrifice to upgrade. fortunately, all tournaments give plenty of money so you will be free to upgrade whatever you want. still, at first I'd recommend to upgrade gear, training yard and doctor so your slaves are actually able to win some fights. If you can't win, you're in for a pinch - and sometimes it's necessary to reload a few times until you can get some wins in (for the exp and money).Constext is really slow, no option to increase its speed yet. people who read quickly will be annoyed.RNG - this has been improved incredibly, but I still have some complaints. sometimes an enemy will use all the right (effective) skills while your char ups his defenses (though he/she could win if they just attacked). It's far less prominent now though, so generally a decent char will win, but you should still save and expect the unexpected outcome. On the other hand, fights shouldn't be completely foreseeable, I think the balance is pretty good right now, maybe a few tweeks and it's perfect.Conclusionthere were serious issues at launch, and the dev has adressed the worst offenders quickly and efficiently. As the game stands now, I can really recommend it - as long as you don't expect the story/depth of a 60$+ game. It's a inexpensive and short game but definitely delivers for it's price"
76561197970675727,Recommended,527710,34914004,Posted: 12 September,all,Expunger,"This game is a gem!  Cant stop playing it.  Super casual.  Turn based.  You can play it while watching a show in another window and you never miss anything.Each turn you can go around town and buy stuff and set your fighters and talk to people and participate in the story. When you have done everything you want you enter a tournament or pass to the next round (week). Each tournament is 3 rounds.   You can choose any fighter (non injured) to fight each round.  You can change fighters and gear between each round.  There are 6 different classes and each class has restrictions to equipment and special equipment and skills.  Each class fares better against certain other classes so you need to have more than 1 fighter on your team.  Once the fight starts you cannot change anything.  You just have to be confident you have the right fighter with the right equipment and the right training.  A fight never lasts more than 30 seconds unless you fight two defenders against each other.  After the fight it moves onto the next round of the tournament.There is a story, it's nothing deep or meaningful but it is interesting enough to keep me wondering what is going to happen next.  It breaks up the rounds very nicely and it definitely doesn't get in the way.  There are choices you can make which appear to maybe be leading towards affecting the direction of various kingdoms.The interface is very basic.  The graphics are rudimentary.  There is no auto save.  It is obviously a very low budget game probably developed by 1 person.  I really enjoyed the pilgrim series they did as well.  Different type of RPG but also a gem of a game."
