I think I was ripped off even at that price.Gladiator Trainer is an utter mess in terms of interface, programming, and game play. A big part of this? A structural bug that I thought was actually part of the game ""working as intended"" that allows me to have every single warrior in my care fight for me in every battle I face. This title is a piece of drivel filled with aweful screen grabs created in Poser 2 and feels like a mediocre attempt to westernize a Japanese visual novel.I will likely get about 50% of the achievements since getting just one now means this title will mar my overall achievement score. But do not take hours played as an endorsement for this piece of garbage."

76561198009316076,Recommended,527990,32910695,Posted: 27 June,all,The Matlock,"There are two things you need to do if you're thinking of playing Gladiator Trainer. First, ignore the promo pic of the pink haired anime girl. Not sure why it's there, and yes it makes the game look silly, but just pretend its not there. It sadly is stuck on the title screen as well, but by that point you'll know what the game is about.Second, the entire game is based around slavery. It's set in a fantasy realm of course, but it is still a realm and a story where you're buying people and forcing them to do your bidding. If this bothers you, then just pass this game on by.With that out of the way, here's the meat of the review. This is a very solid game that you'll get at least a dozen hours out of, making what you pay to purchase it worth your while. It has a distinctive art style, with some nicely rendered 3D models of all the characters and opponents, with a decent soundtrack to keep you going. Presentation wise, it's alright.But what you're coming to this for is the gameplay. You are 100% the trainer ONLY in this game. None of this stuff where you're a trainer/manager and you're magically in control when the battles come. The idea is that you're a person who is not of noble birth, in a land where primarily the nobles are the ones who have 'great houses' and participate in various gladiator tournaments across the land. It's all about you slowly working your way up to the top to become champion.You start small, with a basic estate and two slaves, fighting in local pubs. As you progress in reputation, your estate becomes bigger, eventually adding guard towers, a stable for race horses, an infirmary, a library, a bathouse, and two more cells for four slaves altogether. This is where you spend most of your time, checking on the morale of your slaves, visting them personally, advising your trainer on how best to train them, and then travelling to the local town to purchase new weapons and armor, and a selection of books with beneficial effects. Then it's off to fight in the tournament for that week, and then it keeps going with the various available tournaments rotating each week. Of course, if you have enough money, you can skip a week but that's generally not recommended. You can never have enough money. Also, since you are the trainer you're only watching the battles play out automatically, you do not participate directly. It can be a little frustrating sometimes but overall it adds to the experience rather then takes away.Now, each slave can come from one of six classes; Warrior, Bear, Tower, Blade, Shadow, and Fox. Each one has various strengths and weaknesses. For instance, Fox class slaves can equip throwing stars, but generally seem to have low HP values. Warriors have decent attack and can lower attack and defense, but can be worn down easily. Bears are straight up attacks with plenty of strength but not much else. Shadows use powerful attacks that do signifcant damage in one shot and can heal, and are near unbeatable without the right opponent. In a similar fashion, Towers have beefy defense and can counter attack making them just as good. While I haven't played with a Blade, they have some okay attacks and buffs but they don't seem to stand out much.The difficulty in the game has an odd curve. At first it's fairly difficult, as until you have enough money your slaves with have low morale from poor food, and may try to escape, resulting in, well, escape, or their death. Either way you lose them. But as you progress, your slaves earn experience and become stronger, allowing them to win more fights, which lets you bring in higher quality food and other things to keep their morale up. Once you've built your bathouse you can hire pleasure slaves to, well, you know.The middle of the game is fairly straightforward. Around this time you should have four fighters, be winning tournaments on the regular, and have a sizeable amount of cash to keep your slaves fed and well equipped. This persists all the way to the end, where the last fighter of the last tournament is quite difficult if you haven't prepared well.Along the way there is a main quest where you're trying to prevent an assasination, but all it really revolves around is ""win this tournament to meet with someone"". It's a nice little distraction in between fights. You'll also have a selction of random events, with random people popping up to train your fighters skills for a price, someone challenging your trainer to a fight, and even a father trying to buy the freedom of his long lost daughter from you.You can even get married in this game, to either a wealthy heirness, a battle hardened maiden, or a soft spoken artistic lady. Although marriage is a loose word. Until you reach the highest rank of repuation end game you don't even have a spot to go visit your spouse. When you do visit, they just say something random to you. Other then that they will pop up at the start of the week and say they did something to help your money, slaves, or reputation respectively.It's not a game for everyone. However it is a decent price as mentioned, and once you 'train' yourself to get good at it you'll enjoy it as much as I did."

Visuals seem very old and they need to be polished. Also, an options menu should be added including the screen resolution adjustment. The user interface should be improved too. Other than that, the image used in cover is deceptive and has nothing to do with the game. I strongly suggest that the devs should remove it and use a convenient image instead. In short, this game might've been something very great but the devs missed the chance to do so."

Ignore any of the pointless comments saying, it's NOT an amime rpg woooooaaaaahhhhh... Yeah, course it's not, it clearly shows it's not in the gameplay trailer top of this page. For what it is it's good. Only thing I wasn't sure about was when I changed one of my slaves weapons to 1 handed he wouldn't use his skill in battle, I put him back to 2 handed and vwalla worked again :) But apparently there is a book on slave fighters in the library so it might cover it in there, I don't know.Rpg elements - Level up and Upgrade your fighters weapons and armour by buying better equipment.Story - Again for what it is, not too bad. Sometimes funny, sometimes serioius and gives you choices.Graphics - It is what it is, I think all the graphics, screens, characters look perfectly fine. It's not a triple A game so don't get it then cry your eyes out complaining that the graphics are a million frame rate per second and in 3d and crap...Oh also, you buil a few things at your manor/land, to let you do a few more things with your fighters. And it's it's not overly complex. Overall I would probably give this game a 6 and a half out of 10.If you are into these kind of games rpg/battle simulation/management games, then give it a try,"
76561198093707378,Recommended,527990,33305667,Posted: 6 July,all,Telecommunication,"I have since writing this review completed the game Gladiator Trainer and have gotten all the achivements the game has to offer.The game in essence is a Text Based adventure game with various graphics to help set the scene. It is based around some medievil time when gladiators existed. The game uses slaves, as Gladiators usually were, and writes a story of the player being a slave owner. You make decisions for your slaves, can train and equip them as well as interact with various characters throughout the game. You control a section of land to which you can upgrade and develop to cater to a Cook, Librarian (Scribe) and a Doctor. There is also a trainer that helps train your slaves. There is also a campaign, but I will go over that shortly.The UI was a little had to control at times, and if you are running the game on windowed mode, it can sometimes unbind from the window and you click elseware. My experience of this was a little annoying, but it didn't ruin the game as I kinda understood it after a while.Now while this is all fair and good, my personal opinion of the game is as follows;The game is actually quite enjoyable and I found myself during very uninteractive fights (The slave fights are automated) getting really hype and excited when I see an exceptional hit of upwards 1000 on an enemy who had the advantage. I also enjoyed the small campaign where you are required to help the Queen of the Crownlands, as it gave the game some depth in addition to the fighting.The game is very simple, for sure. The game has it's moments, while it also can be a little painful or grindy. I definitely recommend this game to those who like Text-Based Adventures.Do bear in mind this is personal opinion, you can take or disregard it if you wish."

The sound is good, the game play is simple, and the management aspects of the game keep it fun to the end. And the game's storyline is at least interesting and yet short.There is enough variety in the classes to make consideration worthwhile and enough differing abilities to make each class unique. You really do get more than what you pay for if you like sim management games.On a note, there are reviews that touch on the image the game uses being an anime style image while not being an anime game. The game store page has 5 images and a video posted of what the game looks like.

($2.00... I believe I had it cheaper when it was on sale.)The random scenario occurrences are interesting and break the monotony of the pattern of battle and building.""Real RPG aspect"":  The estate development makes you the ""driving character"".On the fence:You do not control what your fighter does.  They fight how they want.  You try to equip them the best you can.The Negative:The interface can be annoying (mouse pointer vs keyboard).Once an event is made, I do not believe it will repeat.  (i.e. Marriage scenario)Your house manager constantly repeats things you don't care about later in the game (where is the fast forwardbutton).  Also   She should get a new outfit as you advance.Overall:  There are developer mechanical flaws.  However, for the price, this is an good game.

As to gameplay, it too is different. Your main role is to gain slave fighters and train them up until they can become champions of the arena. That said, be careful, apparently their time as fighters is limited before they can buy their freedom. There are also events that happen from time-to-time.Now the combat in the arena matches is automatic. You have to hope RNG favors you enough to win (at least when close). Injuries can really mess things up. And then there is the small issue of your income. Depending on how many individuals you have hired, you can literally depend on the fights to keep you in the green.Also note: The same publisher has a game called Crown Champion: Legends of the Arena.

You start your journey with only a couple of slaves who happen to be inexperienced in combat and your goal is to build your reputation towards the top. To get there, you can develop buildings, hire staff, buy new slaves etc. Although the weekly routine is pretty much the same, the game can surely keep you hooked for a good amount of time. Either way, just like any other regular RPG, the closer you're about to finish, the lesser patience you have (grinding is grinding after all). Another thing that I didn't really like about it was the fact that although your gladiators can learn so many different skills, you rarely see any of them making use of anything.

Z/space as the forward key and X/esc as the back key. that will save you from much headache and facepalming out of furious♥♥♥♥♥♥ so i'd give this game a 3/5...... 4/5 if only they changed the recommended ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. easily 5/5 if they fixed that, and gave more to do after you have done it all besides just playing for the sake of playing."
