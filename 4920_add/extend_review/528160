Lovely explosions, a variety of enemies to murder, gore, etc. It just feels like what i'd hoped red solstice could have been, but without as much tactical stuff (I preferred the tactical stuff but no gamepad support kills it for me, best to use pinnacle as xpadder doesn't allow for switching button maps)Pros: Lovely story/ environments, crazy things. Fun dialog, but most importantly you shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥till it dies (or most likely you die)COUCH COOP! Love it. Online could happen but we have shared screen with lots of profiles.Cons:EDITDevs have been working like hell to make this game worth playing, and it's becoming amazing. If you like the top down shooters, some RPG elements, and devs that care, buy this now. GREAT couch coop, becoming better than helldivers."
,Recommended,528160,33870328,Posted: 28 July,all,Starz,"I'll start out with the cons, so you are left with the good at the end and don't feel like this game is really bad, because it's not. It is a really fun game after you play it for about 3 hours.Cons:-Controls are a little clunky and take a bit to get used to.-You can die by your own nades and proximity mines-Sometimes the continuous enemy spawns can get annoying-Ammo runs out quick if you don't use it sparingly. (I suggest leveling up your melee and using it for lower level enemies so you save your ammo for larger, more difficult enemies)-No multiplayer Co-op. (At least, I don't see any options for this as of now)In the middle:-Linear progression-Guns are just right as far as power, but you can only carry two at a time.Pros:-Story mode is good and wholesome fun. Characters are intriguing and you have your own personal flying robot by your side at all times. What's not to love about that?-Need a little strategy with how to use your main skills as it will determine what the enemy threat level is, so I suggest using your scout at the beginning of each round and then taunting after you have full ammo.-Skill tree is legit and easy to understand.-Bosses can be a bit overwhelming and difficult first time around until you find their weaknesses. Rewarding when you defeat them.-Graphics are decent and gameplay is fluid.-Multiple characters to pick from-4 different levels of difficulty-Option for Story or Survival Mode (Haven't played Survival Mode yet)"

Not sure if that's a pro or a con. Can't change class mid-campaign. Good, but short campaign. It plays more like a helldivers DLC than it's own unique game. Not bad, but not great. My vote would be neutral if that was an option. No multiplayer (online) as of yet. Not a bad game, but not one i would recomend to a friend, nor would i purchase again for full price. For 50% off tho it'd be well worth the price."

76561198012249270,Not Recommended,528160,34022285,Posted: 4 August,all,Sideek,"This is a game I really wanted to love. The genre of high quality top-down shooters is underserved, and when I saw this I picked it up immediately. Unfortunately, while the gameplay is decent, the game doesn't seem finished and I ran into numerous bugs (not the kind you shoot!) and technical problems that ultimately made the experience frustrating. First, the good parts:The core gameplay is solid - shooting and melee are satisfying, if a bit clunky, and there are enough enemy types to keep things interesting. The use of the drone is pretty cool but takes some experimentation to figure out (the game is short on explanation). Resources are limited, so you have to weigh your options carefully. ""Do I shoot this group or use a grenade or bash through them to save ammo?"" Enemies usually just keep coming (the spawn mechanics are a bit hard to understand), so you either keep moving or spend a lot of time bashing/wasting ammo. The guns are fun though, and theres enough variety to let you experiment, particularly with heavy weapons. The customization options with skill points are decent.Unfortunately, this brings us to the bad parts.GRAPHICS GLITCHES EVERYWHERE. Before I say more, I would like to note that I have a several year old gaming laptop and I was forced to run on low graphics to mitigate the FPS lag. Even so, I still had FPS trouble at times. Beyond this, however, I ran into missing textures and enemies teleporting through objects. One level was so bad I was running around half the time in empty space. This is something I might expect from a beta or EA, not a released game. Hopefully these glitches get fixed.Beyond the graphics, the controls can be a bit clunky and the AI is terrible. All the enemies on the map just run towards you without avoiding obstacles. Trying to throw grenades and use skills precisely is tough and not intuitive. If you're not extremely careful they get thrown in random directions and distances, wasting valuable supplies. And, if you die (by a mis-thrown grenade for instance) and have to restart at a checkpoint, all the gates you've opened are now closed. This means you can't backtrack for ammo/guns or escape an onslaught of enemies. I ended up having to restart multiple levels because I couldn't continue. Maybe this is by design, but what's the point of a checkpoint if you have to restart anyways?Overall, I'm very disappointed. With some patches and optimization, this could be a very fun game. At the moment, I can't recommend it :("

76561198055603209,Recommended,528160,33945222,Posted: 1 August,all,Elis Shaimall,"So, i played Red Solstice before and i tried this one not specially hyped about the change in gameplay, but i was happily surprised by this gameThe game is overall good for me, good graphics, fluid gameplay, the first missions of story mode used as a tutorial in disguise but still with enough difficulties to be called missions. made it run on high definition without fps drop or graphic anomalyWe have 4 classes, each with it's own mecanics : Assault (good melee and shooter), Demolition (heavy use of skills), Hellfire (Tank and crowd control), and Terminator (Powerful but decrease suit integrity with each used skills)Having played Red Soltice i know that the Hellfire is the one i play the best among them but each one has its goods and badsThe Assault is an average class, decent damage, decent survivability, decent skills. It's a good idea to begin with it for your first play to understand all the mecanics of the game without any hard drawbackAs a Demolition you'll use many of your skills to make things explode or put mine fields for protection, but that means you will use your supplies really quickly and without supplies you won't be able to use your skills, making you a perfect targetAs an Hellfire you are really tanky and can wipe out horde of weak monsters with your flamethrower but the flamethrower use stamina (making it the only ""unlimited ammo"" weapon) but without stamina you won't be able to run out of range of the bigger threats (in Aetriden(4/5) difficulty with all the defensive passive skills i got 3shots by a behemoth, the weakest big threat you encounter)The Terminator is kind of special to use, looking like an Assault on steroid, your skills decrease your suit integrity (the suit integrity allows you to resurect when you're killed) but the skills are the most powerful from what i saw. People who can manage risks would love to play as Terminator but it's the worse choice for beginnersWhen you choose your class you can then evolve your suit, getting new skills and bonuses, making you stronger and able to take on bigger challengesThe story mode is quite good except for one thing in my opinion : the scenario needs you to have played Red Solstice to really understand the threat you face andwhy you must face a clean-up unit on the last mission, because the Corp is corrupt as hell and don't want the public to know that it's because of them that the Strol outbreak beganThe survival mode is well done, the drone gives you many tactical choices with near immediate effects. If badly used the drone may be your worse enemyAlso, in survival mode, you gain level and keep weapons only if you evacuate, never forget that or you may never get to evolve your suit, leading to frustration and rage quit (this mecanic is similar in Red Solstice)but i'm a little disappointed about 2 things :- in Survival mode we have access to only 1 map. I really hope that other maps will come in the future.- no online coop, at least not for now. but from what i heard they'll do it in the future, so let's give them time to do itThis game is good and can be played by itself but in my opinion it's better to begin with Red Solstice before trying this one to understand some little mecanics that exist in both games and are needed to surviveEdit 05/09/2017 : we have a new survival map with it's own set of objectives to do, a good addition in my opinion"

76561197965400498,Recommended,528160,33911082,Posted: 30 July,all,Seemore Puggins,"Compared to ""The Red Solstice"" I find this game to be an improved take on the IP.  It is a twin stick shooter so the pace I think is a bit faster then the previous game.  I enjoyed the IP for the blending of several concepts from other Scifi IPs, but also having unique concepts that helped to define the back story/lore.  I played the original as much for the unfolding story as the entertaining game play.  Both games have some negative parts, but overall I enjoy them for the positive aspects.  The begin does seem to hand hold the player, but I accept that this is by design to help newer players.  I enjoy the comments between the player, and the AI drone.  It could become annoying later on, but for now it is entertaining to listen as they ramble on about random topics.I would enjoy more games about the Red Solstice IP, or other games developed by Ironward.  I am enjoying what they have so far."
,Recommended,528160,33915721,Posted: 30 July,all,CosmicHobo,"Bottom Line : Content sparse, but very solid and fun.I have yet to finish the main campaign, I was mostly playing survival mode with my wife, which does get a little repetitive because its only the one map so far.From what I have played, it is a very solid twin stick shooters. In my small amount of play time so far, I have had no crashes and no hiccups. The game is solidly made. It is not a buggy mess from what I can tell.Additionally the devs have been very responsive in the forums. I had asked a couple simple questions in the discussions here on steam and within 15 minutes recieved a developer response.I absolutely reccommend the game. The Singleplayer campaign I do believe they said should take between 4-8 hours. I can testify to that as I have not yet finished it. Survival mode only has 1 map currently, but it appears as if the UI for starting your matches has plenty of room to grow with new maps. There is a small selection of firearms and combat suits on offer. The firearms have your basic hierarchy on there with a pistol, smg, a couple diffferent rifles, a LMG and a sniper rifle. In addition to some unique class skills, and in one case a flame thrower for one of the classes.My literal only two gripes at this point are that one of the suits is locked behind single player campaign getting finished, which is honestly not a huge deal at all, just... You know... ""ITS MY SUIT AND I WANT IT NOW!"" lol. And the other gripe is the lack of conent on the survival side of things. I would love to see some more maps, guns and combat suits.So yeah, this is a game I would buy again. I have absolutely no regret with my purchase and look forward to the road ahead."
76561198009156462,Recommended,528160,33913062,Posted: 30 July,all,Ces,"You know, the simplest way for me to put this is that this game feels like Red Solstice Lite.And that is by no means a bad thing. Red solstice was a great game due to its depth, complexity, and challenge, but those very same things coupled with a heavy multiplayer emphasis made it quite inaccessable for many. This game brings the core elements of the experience without the need for a rigorusly trained and prepared premade team. Sit down, explode space zombies, have fun.Also the flamethrower in this game feels flipping fantastic. The makers of this game understood that, when you have to battle nameless horrors, you should always and forever be able to set them on fire."
76561198186812151,Recommended,528160,35037596,Posted: 17 September,all,clarkeveritas,"Great Twin-Stick Shooter with several different game modes.  It looks nice and gets the basic gameplay down while adding an almost horror-ish element with many dark areas only visable through your flashlight.... which can only shine one direction at once.  Think ""Dead Nation"" if anyone has played that but replace zombies with..... alienish space monsters and some... space zombies?  Good enemy variety and 4 different classes- each with varying skill trees.  Nice variety of main weapons, usable items, class-based special abilities/items, and ""heavy"" items including the lovable Flamethrower, Charged-Beam-Type-Uber-Cannon, Explosive-Heavy-Launcher-Type-Deal.... you get the deal.  I've mostly messed around with the campaign (which would play a bit differently with other classes- so I'm looking forward to subsequent playthroughs) but there is a Survival Mode.... I've only messed with it a little bit but you are on a large map and are to do certain objectives in order to get an evac-ship.  There are defensive structures to build and all the campaign's weapons and goodies are present..... I believe you must have a seperate character in Survival Mode so your weapon progress and leveling up/skill trees would start from scratch.There is some RPGish-ness here, too, which I LOVE.... you level up your ability with weapons.... so while the regular Assault Rifle might not have as much punch as the LMG, you might have enough levels into the AR to make it worthwhile over the agruably better LMG.  The skill tree has the basics such as more speed, health, faster reloading and whatnot- but there are some cool gamechangers... I can't speak for all the skill-trees, but the Assault Tree has a Cluster Bomb ability that would replace your ""Main"" class ability, beit the Enhanced Ammo or Crazy-Fire-Explosive-Mine.... you can upgrade the Cluster Bomb to explode over a larger area, do more damage, and cooldown quicker to allow for more usage.  You have a drone companion that houses some of the more unique features of this game.  You have a ""threat"" meter.... which is pretty self-explanatory.  Different actions can increase or decrease the meter.  I believe it slowly goes up over time but you can have your drone go collect supplies for you in exchange for an increased threat meter.... the drone can also put down an energy shield to stop/slow enemies and place a SUPERHUGE bomb that can wipe out huge areas.  Your last ability, Taunt, decreases the Threat meter BUT will immediately spawn enemies based on how high your Threat meter is..... so it becomes a balancing act of how far you can push or what locations you think you can hold off a hoarde and thus use Taunt.  It's a neat system that, once you understand it, can greatly help with both enjoyment and survival.When done correctly I tend to enjoy Twin-Stick-Shooters..... especially when they have some RPG-elements.  Solstice Chronicles: MIA gets the gameplay down and adds enough little twists to make this quite a fun and potentially high-hour game.  I'm looking forward to finishing my initial campaign as the Assault Dude and then playing through as a Demolitions Guy and the third class..... which I believe is a ""Slow but Heavily Armored"" type.  The 4th class is unlocked after you beat the campaign on a certain difficulty and I don't know much about it.  Highly recommended if you like Twin-Stick Shooters.... I really LOVE Dead Nation and this is a game I'd put up there with DN."

76561197991783625,Not Recommended,528160,33910828,Posted: 30 July,all,Fnord,"Definitely feels like an early release and I'd feel better about recommending it if it was labeled as such.  While the game does offer some fun to be had it feels pretty unpolished and has some annoying elements.  Namely that you have to complete 5 levels for every class just to see their skill trees and abilities.  Once you do the limitations of customization become readily apparent, with each class you can only use one of the three native abilities at any given time and you can not expermient with them untill points are invested, the exception is the demolition class which can slot all three native abilities but is also the only class that gains consumable slots for non-native abilities so if you do decide to use all native abilities your other passive bonus is useless.  There are many little poor design choices.  The best weapon in the game is only available to the most tanky class, the hellfire class flamethrower making it the clearly the best class in the game imo.  The standard game weapons are for the most part a bit lackluster and the soldier is the only class that gets a bonus to the standard weapons with a dmg increase during sustained fire.The tutorials and threat meter mechanic never really come together in any meaningful way.  Most of the levels end really abruptly, sometimes just getting close to an exit while the screen is still filled with enemies you intend to keep fighting will suddenly trigger the end of the mission.  There are absolutely no bonuses to killing more enemies or stronger elite enemies, at the end of levels you get the same number of skill points to allot and no level specific suit or weapon upgrades carry beyond the level you are on.Survival mode actually brings together the games elements together in a more cohesive way than the campaign does but with only one map and identical objectives everytime it becomes monotonous pretty quickly.I hope the developers keep working on this game to make it feel like a more coherent and fleshed out game as it does have some decent elements but I can't reccomend paying full or close to full price in the games present condition."

The effects, animations, how zoomed in it is, scale - everything sells the experience.  I've played 10 hours, mainly on survival, and it's a great loop of trying to get out alive to keep your loot and unlock xp.  The loot and xp is quite well designed and there are several different character/classes (suits) to play as which have very different possibilities and approaches.  Weapons upgrade by use - which I quite like too - and something like the SMG doesn't get better at shooting, instead allowing quicker movement and skill command speed (an officers weapon) which is a nice twist on simply the DMG number going up.All of that gives me a reason to play one more run (completing survival can take an hour) - and the gameplay is so good I want that excuse!  This is something I missed in Alien Swarm- and am pleased to have it here.Desperately needs a bit of polish elsewhere - but the GAME is here.  Just need to polish the story, add more survival maps and put an online coop in to go with the excellent local coop (played at least 5 hours of that and it's great - you get a lot of player slots so your buddy can have their own character and enjoy levelling them up).I think the main game should be the survival mode - it's got the gameplay to go the distance I think."

The leveling system and controls (although it could use some improvement, no matter what i choose the character doesn't look in the direction where the mouse is, just when shooting or aiming) are good. But the gameplay is hectic at best. The infinite spawning, fast enemies make it feel like it wants to be a bullet hell, but the finite ammo wants to be a survival game, and the no-map (there is no minimap or map at all) points to exploration, and this is why it fails at every ascpect. At one point the enemy horde wave made me so frustrated and angry I just Alt+F4-d out. And there is no online co-op, like in the predecessor, and even if you play co-op it is 2 player only and on the same screen.I was realy hoping that this would be a good top-down shooter (and not a bullet hell, but the same survival tactics as in The Red Solstice, but with twin stick controls), but it is not, and at this development state I cannot recommend it.

This is because of the developers former game, which was filled with bugs, and god knows what of boss glitches, but yet still offered alot of entertainment due to the fact the game was built up around being a true hardcore Coop game with must-have decent players. Who had to have their wits about them to lead the way around the block.Which brings me to the next step; the games current state as it is:- Optimized for consoles (crappy hardware) and respective players (to drink anti freeze and be real ""gamers"") to enjoy an easy game without much mindfull tricks and challenge.- Michael Bay instructed this game i think.- No multiplayer function except local twin stick gaming (I feel like throwing up just thinking about it).- Lovely graphics, great sounds.- Poor gameplay value besides the 8 hour campaign.This game reminds me of other multiplayer games with an ""AI"" that just follows you dead in your footsteps. So the game survival play is just about running, turn and shoot, running, turn and shoot. Rinse and freaking repeat untill you feel like tired of doing the same thing over and over.This games just screws you over due to poor views range, when you accidently run into a horde without the means to get away.. oh, never mind, when you ""die"" you can just jumpstart your dead corpse while it is being ""attacked"" by the horde that just nailed your♥♥♥♥♥to the ground.. and they die when you jumpstart.With this i can only say the game is appealing to a child with a console.To descripe what I am hoping to find in a game:When a game climax at entertaining me the most. Is when it offers me a challenge where I fight to the last drop of blood and breath with teeth and claws to haul my♥♥♥♥♥over the finish line with every trick or tactic i can come up with (even if it would take me 50+ tries to get there).As I think a developer succeed when he can challenge his players to this extend and lead them by the nose over the walls he/she will meet throughout the game. Always showing the way, but throws everything he can think of in your face while you have to push through it. (AND NO, I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT A ♥♥♥♥ING DIFFICULTY SETTING).This experience was what i felt in 'the red solstice' multiply times, while trying to lead a group of people to victory (mostly ended in fails untill i learn the ropes which took roughly about 150 hours to do). I ended up on 400+ hours and was done with the game since it had nothing more to offer me.Then i play this... thinking.. if only I had a alot bigger maps with difffernt terrains and at least 3 other people with me to fight the onslaught with.. but no, i have to play alone, die alone, jump start myself just to repeat the trivial process.I hope to see ALOT more meat on this game, but as it is now, I can honestly not recommend it."

,Not Recommended,528160,33874378,Posted: 29 July,all,Black Cat,"They took a very big gamble making a game like this, and trying to focus their assets more on the story, than they would on multiplayer survival, like their previous entry into the solstice universe. The story is just kind of ""meh"". It is generic to the point its forgetable. The real meat of the game does come from MIA's survival mode.The gameplay is easy enough, its a twin stick shooter. The only complaint I really have is that grenades are launched in the direction my character is facing, instead of where my mouse is pointing. So while running I will throw a grenade right on top of myself. Its a horde based survival game, you are going to keep moving. Throwing a nade in front of you, as you are required to keep moving is a very terrible idea and a very big design flaw.The remedy for this would be to have the feet and torso work on separate axis. The torso moves around via the mouse, while the legs move via wsad. As its set up, the torso and legs move with wsad and the gun moves with mouse. You can aim behind and start firing, which will slowly move your characters torso towards the mouse, but that will only burn ammo. Instead you have to turn and face 100 enemies, right on your tail, to fire at them, or use abilities.Survival is quite enjoyable. However making a horde mode, objective style game, does not work without multiplayer. Due to local coop only, it has severely limited replayability. A good game is supposed to make you feel like you are progressing, and that this progression has made a difference. This game succeeds at the former, but severely fails at the latter. Sure I know I've done something amazing, but no one else does, due to the fact my character is all alone.I am sorry but my recommendation is no, at this time. It is a risky gamble to focus on what they did, and I do not feel it paid off. Their previous entry is incredibly fun if you like a commando style, rts, survival game. The community on it is mostly dead, but if you can get enough of your friends to play, its a blast. I would recommend you look into The Red Solstice instead of this.Note: I do have some fun with Solstice Chronicles: MIA, I just wont recommend it at this time. Wait for a sale or grab it if they add online multiplayer, which they said they would ""only add if the sales do well, due to a limited budget""... Generic story devs... generic..."

You have to figure out most of it by playing so many replays and only once you have done this then you can play it.There is currently only a single survival map...I imagine more coming, and it follows exactly that...PLAY BY ERROR UNTIL YOU KNOW ENOUGH TO PLAY IT but, even then eventually something you have not seen or just doesn't make sense occurs and your back to play by error to figure it out that next bit just so you can continue.Not a bad game just really feels like a early access release or something. I wouldn't advise purchasing it at the moment assuming it improves."

And the game just literally give me THREE, i have no choice but to run away and speedrun the whole stage which defeat the purpose of shoot em up game.3/5Its a good game but with cumbersome and overly complex system."
