,Not Recommended,528200,28960657,Posted: 2 January,all,HTWingNut,"Ugh. Where do I start? I wanted an affordable semi-pro video editing program. This seemed to fit the bill, considering I picked it up when it was on sale on Steam. It seemed good at first, but now that I've been working with it more, the more I want to shred it into tiny little bits. The darn thing keeps crashing, as in hangs, then crashes. I found a way to disable multithreading with live editing which seemed to help fix it for now. The preview window half the time goes black and can't preview my work. Using it as a pop up window seems to help, but now I can't bring it up as a pop  up window any more. And now if I run more than one instance half the time it just hangs.I have probably spent more time futzing around with working around the glitches than I have actual video editing. I'll continue to use it, because well, I paid for it and don't have a lot of choice. It seems a lot of these glitches have been inherent in the product since early releases back to version 10 or 11 that were never addressed. So not sure what the hell they are doing with each release.In any case, be wary. I can't recommend this to anyone especially someone like me that is a novice, because I can't learn actual video editing, it's mostly trouble shooting the dang program..."

Other than that, i have no regrets purchasing an authentic copy of this program.I highly recommend this to those who are looking for an easy, professional video editor."
,Recommended,528200,32168774,Posted: 3 June,all,President Jack,"While it pisses me off that this software is suddenly -45% off shortly after I buy it, I don't regret buying it when I did. I've been using Sony Vegas (9/10) for years and it is by far one of the best video editing programs available, second only to AAE.Unlike AAE, however, Sony Vegas isn't 'animation friendly'. It's perfect for creating music videos, montages, home videos and other cinematic projects using pre-filmed and/or pre-created footage. Using Sony Vegas in conjunction with AAE, however, is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic.That's about it, I guess."

The update installed alongside, broke the licensing, and I had to uninstall and manually clean out the Windows registry, then reinstall to get it working. It still pops up the update dialog.Only half my AVCHD files work, some cause the program to freeze solid on import or playback.Rendering only works sometimes, when it fails the time remaining keeps counting, but progress always at 0%, never doing anything.Unstable, and it has to have Steam connected to work. Not recommended."

,Recommended,528200,33164423,Posted: 2 July,all,Moeniac,"Excellent editing software. It's easy to pick up on and offers a wide variety of things to do should you choose to master it. I've been using VEGAS Pro 13 for a while now and 14 isn't much different, so I guess while I am a little upset that there wasn't a lot that was new, I'm still glad that meant I knew how to do everything from the get-go. I also had a couple of issues with the activation key (as well as some other general issues), but things seem to be running smoothly now. Overall, if you plan to take your editing seriously and want something on a professional level that's easy to start with, this is my go-to choice."

,Not Recommended,528200,34094761,Posted: 7 August,all,Quantum Chainsaw,"This crashes A LOT. In just a few hours of working on one fairly simple project, it crashed 4 times. Each crash was under different circumstances, too. When I finally got my finished project to render (it crashed the first time I tried), there was a glitch in one frame of the rendered video that I can't see in the editor even when I closely examine frame-by-frame.How does anyone get away with selling a video editor at this price that crashes this often and you can't trust to render accurately?I'll probably keep using it because I don't want to spend hundreds more dollars to get something else with comparable functionality, but I'm not happy about it.At least the UI is decent. Mostly. Actually, some parts of it (like text positioning) are pretty shameful."

I started with 13 and my only real gripe with 14 is that they changed some of the icons. Why they did this? I have no idea. As with Office, I wish they would leave the UI alone as we've all learnt a certain format. Flashly UI or updated icons are not required. Consistancy WRT UI is appreciated. That said, I recommend this program, espcially when it's on sale. Although my hours with 14 are low, I have many hundreds of hours with 13 which wasn't aquired through Steam."

But if you just need a simple video editing software just go for the other one that not coast this much.

The software is great, but unfortunate at the moment the steam edition are not getting any updates at all. The answer from the guys over at vegas creative is ""the problem is, we also don't know how to (give you the updates)...But we have put the problem to our list for sending to developers"". So if you're going to buy this great software, I would suggest you buy it directly fromhttp://www.vegascreativesoftware.comsince their updates are released frequently.No the software released from their page is not compatible with steam edition."

I got it and used pirated versions until I got Movie Studio Platinum for about 50% cheaper then regular price. Now in last 2 weeks I was searching for cheaper version of Vegas Pro because I had to use some premium features and now when I got it for about 70% cheaper then regular price I would say, it is nice to get it geniune after long time using it pirated."

However I have resolved my own issue, and this is how I did it:https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-suite/kb/error-1303-installer-insufficient-privileges.htmlI performed this procedure in Safe Mode, resolving the problem for all software experiencing this issue. Since I did not get the opportunity to test the software, I cannot give a better review. On the other hand I wish I might have received this resolution sooner."
