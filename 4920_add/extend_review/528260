76561197988533180,Recommended,528260,31407714,Posted: 27 April,all,Shovelface,"Just finished playing the entire game. You'll see I'm at 26 minutes and a good 8 minutes of that was sorting out some technical difficulties. For the amount of content I would keep the game at its sale price, because is just a demo. Though a REALLY GOOD DEMO. Two more difficulties to work through, so I'm sure a lot more time will have to go into besting them.Pros:- The combat was exciting.- The second level required going back and forth between melee and range, and it required some brain and coordintation to rapidly switch between the two.- I'm drenched in sweath. Bosses constantly throw attacks at you that require a lot of bobbing and weaving.Cons:- Just the amount of content. Three five minute levels. They're not charging a whole lot, but I'd hope that more levels are on their way, or I'd feel a little short-changed.- A little bit choppy on the end boss. Running a i7-6700k 4ghz and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070. The graphics are pretty epic, so not sure if what I have is still ""good""Overall: 8/10   Exactly the kind of VR genre I want to see developed more. A fun, action packed adventure that takes real skill to beat, and also gets you a six-pack along the way. This game isn't everything I hoped for, but it's an exciting step."
,Recommended,528260,31512167,Posted: 2 May,all,Cheru,"One of the most enjoyable VR experiences I've had to date, HOWEVER, this is NOT a full game.I just need to get that out of the way first, because I know a lot of people are going to be sour over shelling out $9 for something that can be completed in full in about 20 minutes. This game is essentially a teaser for what the final product ""might"" be, if the developers continue working on it and actually end up adding more content to it.With that aside, let me talk about the game itself. Titan Slayer is hands down, one of the most intense and exhilirating VR ""fighting"" games I've ever played. The controls are fluid and your movements are reproduced perfectly in the game world. The amount of space that the game requires is also very modest, and I was able to enjoy the game fully in a 1.5m x 2.5m space without accidentally bumping into or hitting anything, or even needing to be cautious or aware of my surroundings. I feel like this is a hugely important mechanic when designing a VR fighting game, and one that many developers seem to overlook. There are a lot of games out there that encourage or even require overly exaggerated movements in order to perform what would otherwise be regular movements in the real world. This leads to all sorts of problems if you're playing in a confined space and are concerned about breaking something in your room or breaking your Vive's controllers. This however, is a non-issue with Titan Slayer. Thumbs up for this.The graphics are fantastic and as soon as you hop into the main hall at the beginning of the game, you'll instantly get a strange but familiar feeling, like you've been there before. I like to call it the ""Dark Souls"" vibe, and no word of a lie, it looks exactly like you've been plopped right into the middle of a Dark Souls game. Of course, the actual mission levels are different as you're fighting off waves of enemies that eventually lead to a boss fight, and this is where Titan Slayer really shines. One of the main selling points for VR adopters is the desire to feel a sense of scale that simply can't be reproduced on a monitor, and booooy oh boy, will you feel it with Titan Slayer. It's honestly an amazing feeling to look up in front of you and see a humongous snake ready to swallow you up whole, or a giant fire breathing demon 100 times larger than you slam his huge fist right down, shattering and destroying the ground around you. It's simply brilliant. Thumbs up for this, too.The game also features skill progression in the form of unlockable weapons that you obtain as you progress, and that you can switch out before each battle in order to ensure you have the perfect load-out for the titan you're about to face. Though the game is currently very limited in content, it features swords, shields, pistols, huge revolver-like shotguns, machine guns, a bow AND a grenade! There's a lot to pick from for a game with only 3 stages (currently), but I feel like there's a decent amount of replayability to be had if you wish to try and complete each of the missions on every difficulty setting. Thumbs up for the progression and customization.Overall, I was happy with my purchase and won't be refunding it, even though the amount of content is very small at this time. It's a great game to hop into and immerse yourself in a fantasy battle against ogres, serpents, knights and demons. It's also a really cool game to show off to your mates. I do hope that the developers continue to work on the game and don't just leave it in its current state. It has a lot of potential, and I'd like to see that potential expanded on in the form of more stages, enemies, and customization options etc.I put together a brief video of my time with the game that you're welcome to take a look at if you're interested.Cheers.https://youtu.be/_FuI8wHNt9A"

I'll admit, the opening sequence caught me by surprise. Gave me a good spook.Additonal Notes:Runs fine on low spec machine.The interactive menu screen is a nice touch."
76561197982012366,Recommended,528260,31512472,Posted: 2 May,all,PsycoHayko,"Good visuals. Poor sound design. Somewhat innovative gameplay mechanics. weapons dont seem to have any weight to them, the combat experience isnt exactly polished. I would give this 3.5 stars out of 5. Worth the $10 for me."
,Recommended,528260,31420724,Posted: 28 April,all,Krasniy Metall,"Pros:1. Very, very active game. Will make you sweat.2. Cool actions, good choice of weapons3. Thrill of killing massive enemies4. Actually challenging bossesCons:1. You'll need a lot of space to move around in. or else you'll end up breaking something2. Short game without a narrative3. No mechanism to help aim with the bow"
,Recommended,528260,31432986,Posted: 28 April,all,The One,"For the price this is a very solid game.They start you off slow and i was thinking ""okay,,,, this is just another hack and slash VR game....""they you start to see how the game play mechanics work. Dodging, blocking, parrying....and the difficulty ramps up really quick.after i reached the second stage i was doging and swinging and shooting with 100% effort.now the weapons are a little shaky and a bit weird, but the intensity just completly draws your attention away from it, i only noticed in the training stage.for the content in here now it is worth it.I really hope they add more to this, as it could be a solid VR game and has a lot of potential for a ""AAA"" VR game.TL;DR: It's VR Darksouls.... Get it...."
,Recommended,528260,31606509,Posted: 7 May,all,Muncle Uscles,"The most fun I've had in VR in a while.Visually it really nails the sense of scale - a giant lava dude the size of a 10 story building is quite something to behold.The combat system is really fluid, it feels great to dodge attacks at the last moment, get in a couple of quick slashes with your swords, then drop them grabbing your shotguns for some long range damage as the enemy retreats - you can really pull of some cool♥♥♥♥♥♥if you're willing to put in a bit of time to get good at it.It's short, but there's a ton of replayability - the goal is not just to beat the levels, but to do it as quickly and cleanly as possible, go for the high score.Plus it's great exercise on the harder difficulty levels."
76561198365642238,Recommended,528260,31492056,Posted: 1 May,all,karmarc,"The ""time played"" u see here is the time i needed to complete the game on easy. So the Game is very short (of course its early access, but still very short). Because of the amount of content, i think the price is a bit too high. the discount price should be the normal price for this. But the Game was fun, and thats the main point. So overall i can recommend this game.But i had framedrops in the beginning of the last boss fight with a gtx 1080, 32 GB RAM and an i7, i think you should really do some opt. for the performance here. Oh yeah and the pistols feel uncomfortable for me cus u have to hold the vive controller upwards, not to the front."

I was hoping the melee would be satisfying and specific to my moves with the swords but it feels very unpolished.Spoilers!.......................I got a refund.  I'm sorry- I wanted to like it.
,Recommended,528260,31409083,Posted: 27 April,all,Hull Cogan,"short as ♥♥♥♥... but I really, REALLY hope the devs do more with this. this kind of idea for a VR game is amazing and with more levels/levels where you actually move around, we could get Shadow of The Colossus or Monster Hunter VR. we need it.the visuals are really jaw dropping. having a giant sand cobra shoot into the sky above me and tower over my ship was the first time I've had that sense of just pure ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; that you get from a really cool boss fight. PLEASE do more with this, and PLEASE support this team"

The game is awesome when it does work.The combat feels well done and engaging.  Very polished like a proper action game good music and high quality everything.Might be short but there's replayability the whole point isnt to beat the game but to do it with ""style"""

It just doesn't feel polished.  Many Early Access and even free VR games have better graphics, sound, gameplay mechanics, presentation, immersion physics, etc."

I hope to see more of this, with a fleshed out story/campaign. It's definitely worth the price you pay."

76561198015947523,Not Recommended,528260,31514276,Posted: 2 May,all,Dapper Young Fellow,"This game is ok, there's no real skill to the fighting (you just have to flail randomly). As for the second level, IT KEEPS CRASHING. THIS IS REDICULOUS I'VE TRIED RELOADING BOTH STEAMVR AND THIS GAME MULTIPLE TIMES AND IT STILL KEEPS CRASHING ON THE SECOND LEVEL. FIX THIS OR GIVE ME A REFUND, IT MAKES THE GAME UNPLAYABLE"
,Not Recommended,528260,31513062,Posted: 2 May,all,SeeksNDestroys,"This is my first ever negative review, i only have one concern with this game which made me get a refund, if seller amends this i would buy back in future and remove this if possible.The game says standing, sitting, room scale this is by far incorrect its room scale. on the main menue where you can select your wepons i could not even touch the board as i was hitting my wall with my fist i have the standing setup and it was out of my  circle even worse it was to my wall side, the other side was open and unused and it was such a head blag as the dev could have easily moved things over when testing it, you  could not play this sat down . at the begining it shows you a safe area you have which is a square but thats only safe if you have room sale set up.rest of the game seemed ok from what i could get the feel for without banging my head on wall"

76561198144132642,Recommended,528260,31533764,Posted: 3 May,all,zeldalinkring,"I loved this game. Super fun, super intense and super cool boss fights. I don't get shocked by things in VR anymore (because I am so used to it), but I jumped backwards when the second boss apeared and audibly yelled once or twice.Although I would like some more content, I was very satisfied. Yes the price is somewhat high for the content but with the different difficulties and showing people the game, I will get my moneys worth."
76561198072744883,Recommended,528260,31516775,Posted: 2 May,all,rolandfischer2,"Seriously fun! This is a great first step to what i crave to see in VR one day, a D&D style RPG. This gets the feel and combat down well of that. the third level is legit freaky the first time, I love it. Gonna put more hours into this for sure, and its good at keeping your heart rate up!"
76561197963563514,Recommended,528260,33420708,Posted: 9 July,all,morderkaine,"Pros :Nice sense of scale with the enemies, especially the bossesDecent combat mechanics - dodging attacks, attacking back with a sword at certain points (or can just shoot guns).A few different ways to maximize points to try for the leaderboardGreat exercise with all the dodging! After the first time playing my legs were sore the next day from all the super low ducking I had to do, works up a decent sweat! Main reason I kept the game.Cons :It's short. And fairly easy.Sword combat has no finesse or skill to it (not that its meant to in this game).The developer has completely abandoned it and has left a few bugs in it. (Bug I have - dropping guns to switch to other weapons doesn't work, I have to hit pause which auto-drops them. Grip button is supposed to drop guns, but it works like 1/100 times I press the button. My grip buttons work fine in other games)Basically a fun, short, game that has done a great job of letting you fight giant enemies without it feeling cheesy, with a few bugs that will likely never be fixed.If its on sale, a definate recommend. Otherwise a ok recommend."
76561197960498075,Recommended,528260,33085351,Posted: 1 July,all,DiamondTear,Very polished and good looking game. Has the best tutorial I've seen out of VR games. There's only enough content if you want to chase leaderboard positions or achievements.
,Recommended,528260,33766130,Posted: 24 July,all,Brian David Phillips,"This can be a lot of quick fun.  It would be nice if there were more levels though.  For what's there, it's a good solid fun piece.  Now, please add more, more, more!The current three areas are worth the go but they can be repetitive if that's all there is - even though they do demonstrate different approaches to enemies.Here's a quick video from my channel:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=layvmCfeNXQ"
,Recommended,528260,34535737,Posted: 27 August,all,-DOOMER-,"This game is shorter than I thought it would be, but it was still a lot of fun.  There could have been much more content and a bit more polish, but its still a good game.   I love how its just bigger than most anything else out there right now.  The scale of the game is just huge, and a very good use of VR's potential.  7.5/10  not a must play, but I dont feel bad having spent my money on it."
