It might seem like a simple twin stick shooter, but the polish is in evidence in every facet of gameplay, point, shoot dodge, try not to die as the pressure slowly builds forcing you into desperate maneouvers just to stay alive until you die ina shower of neon sparks, ready to play the game again, again, again... oh excuse me, I have to go and play some more!"

Like asteroids, but intense (and fun)8/8 its gr8 m8 and werf the w8.Not to mention the price means its like permenatly on sale.Get this game to play when you just want to mess around and play something arcade-y but has had a lot of effort put into it."

All sorts of dazzling colors, weapsons and numbing visualizations that make this a wonderful modern take on the ancient arcade games many of us grew up playing.  High replayability!"

Don't even think about playing this with mouse and keyboard - even though it's possible, it's so much more enjoyable with a proper controller."
,Recommended,528270,30908283,Posted: 2 April,all,Broxxar,"An awesome ""one-more-run"" arcade shooter backed by a wicked soundtrack with visuals that are as chaotic as they are mesmerizing. NEON Ultra delivers on classic arcade nostalgia highscore chasing. You'll end every round feeling like you can do better next time.At first your deaths will feel unfair, but eventually you'll learn the various breeds of enemies and how the audio cues coupled with strong shape language give you the couple hundred milliseconds you need to react and plan your position and aim.My only gripe is that I want more! More enemy types, game modes, weapons, and powerups! More NEON Ultra!"
,Recommended,528270,32117190,Posted: 1 June,all,binaryFerret,"This game made me call a Triangle the c word.Nice solid little game with a lot of polish. Lovely visuals and nice little effects and touches that work really well and give a very tight feel. I'm pretty crap at these types of games, but had a lot of fun. Great price. If you're into arcadey shoot em ups then I think you'll defo like this.Really really liked the distortion effects!"

Its gameplay is a clone between Geometry Wars and Asteroid.  There are a varieties of unique baddies with different behavior and the incoming asteroids will flood the screen when least expected.  There are plenty of powerups to pick up and once you max out your weapon, you feel invincible and mowing down everything in your path.  The graphics is bright and colorful and I love the particle graphics.  The soundtracks is uplifting and fast pace that blend in nicely with gameplay.There are only 1 game mode which is Endless mode just like Geometry Wars and has the same price match.  For the price is still worth having in your library if you are a fan of twin-stick shooters."
,Recommended,528270,25793586,"Posted: 30 September, 2016",all,OdatNurd,"This is a great twin stick shooter; looks like there are keyboard/mouse controls, but this really shines with a controller. The visuals are stunning, the music is pulse pounding, the controls are butter smooth and ultra responsive and the polish level is evident from top to bottom. I highly recommend a nice dark room and some headphones for the full experience.I jumped in immediately after purchase to give it a spin and ""one more gamed"" myself through an hour and a half of playing, so I would be wary of the addiction level of the game."

76561198156528805,Not Recommended,528270,28544175,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,jwtrooper,Really looked good... cross between asteroids and geometry wars but seems to lack good execution and doesn't really mimic either well. Just seems a bit stiff on the controls and could use some variations on the game play.I'd suggest checking out either waves or polychromatic to scratch the twin stick shooter itch.

CHECK, CHECK and CHECK.If you have a craving for intense, unpretenious score chasing action, then NEON Ultra will certainly be right down your alley? Heck, you probably already grabbed it. It's a total steal at $4.It's frantic, tight, well put together, and a perfect example of what arcade twitch gaming can be like in Space Year 2016."

Looks good, sounds good, and the gameplay feels well tuned.  Controls feel precise.  Impacts and so on are satisfying.  Difficulty is pitched about right for me.  Pretty simple/short, but enough variety in the enemies to stop it getting stale too quick.Certainly worth £3 if you like this sort of thing!Would get back on it now, but I have work tomorrow :-("

,Recommended,528270,25864655,"Posted: 4 October, 2016",all,LMOrchard,"Like Asteroids? Like Geometry Wars? Like the 80s and synthpop and a neverending barrage of bewildering colors? Like a fair game where you pretty much always know what you did wrong?Fairly simple enemies with predictable patterns - they build up one or a few at a time. Easy to take on individually, if you keep the screen clear. Awful in combination if you don't. Weapon upgrades start to feel satisfyingly powerful, but it can get easy to lose track of your ship. Eventually your eyes will cross as you try to keep track of your ship and where you're targeting.Overall, $4 is a steal for this game."
