76561198062443201,Recommended,528460,29987918,Posted: 17 February,all,twdougherty,"Fantastic sandbox MMORPG!This is the first MMO I've played where a ""joint"" is a craftable item. You farm hemp, dry it into ""weed"", and then craft it with paper. It heals you and gives you the munchies (which is a good thing in the context of the game).I'll admit though, I refunded the game after I bought it the first time and then decided to give it another go. It's a great game, very deep systems, but it is tough getting started. Here are a few very important starter tips:-Don't mess with any dead bodies or graves at all. You'll become a criminal and then you can be killed by anyone. Almost everyone makes this mistake at first.-You can go ahead and eat raw meat. It won't hurt you.-Don't overeat or you'll walk really slow, and this makes new players think the game itself is really slow, when really it's just because they ate too much.-to start out you can craft ropes out of grass and sell to the NPCs in town, as well as making ""flower essence"" for potions out of flowers at the herbology table in town, which you can also sell to the NPCs. It only takes an hour or two to save up enough money this way to buy a piece of land.-when you drop several items on the ground in the same spot, it turns into ""garbage"". If you play in garbage you get ""plague"" and this drains your life and kills you. Don't play in garbage or litter. Just ""destroy"" items you don't want by right clicking and selecting ""destroy."""

It just shows how little Tatrix cares for the players who have been supporting the game on the EU server.  He has basically abandoned it to work on the Japan server, but he will do the same with it after a few months. I think the main problem is that he does not have enough knowledge and/or experience to develop the game further to make it actually enjoyable instead of having us spend hours grinding, only to make money by opening a new server instead of expanding what he already started.  Game came out in December, 2016 - 5 months ago and the EU server is pretty much toast.  Only a few die hards still playing the game. I wish Steam would not support “wanna be”  developers unless the game is free to play.  What a huge disappointed and waste of time this game ended up being.  It is so sad because it did have potential, but it is only as good as the developer makes it and if he is not invested in the players of his game, it will not get any better.  He should have worked on the game instead of changing the graphics every few weeks to make it look like they were doing something! Beware everyone playing on the Japan Server!!  It is only a matter of time."

I spent so much time making ropes so i could pay the rent on my claim and alot more on fences to defend my claim. Then after many hours I was able to make a couple of leather sacs so I could carry a few more things., it takes 8 slots just to collect the grass you need for one rope, One rope will get you 30 silver and rent is 8 gold for one week that is a lot of rope. Never had time to master combat. Then people who know how to play will make a new character and hunt down new players then proceed to berate you call you soft and a cry baby. I was teleported right in front of this guy and started to run away but he had magic and chased me half way across the map till he killed me.They do that to say they were only level 15 they are no better than you but they know what they are doing. you lose everything you were holding. now my character is buck naked and all that time wasted. I just cant justify spending all this time to recover and still no bette at combat. These are just a few things I wish I knew before I wasted my money and all that time on this game. They will berate you because they already have your money.  I'm just mad at myself for paying for this and i'm never going to p[ay again. I wish I could give it to sombody."

After 100 hours played, I am sure I will be putting many more. This game is very addicting!Overview:This game is primarily an mmo, crafting, and survival game. In the beginning you will find yourself a spot in the world and stake your claim. This is your land to work, where you are safe from PvP. The idea is to level your skills to build new powerful items. The areas outside of claims and the city are PvP free for alls.Pros:The crafting system is very rewarding, allowing you to craft a large range of items from wooden swords to energy guns to castle walls and much more. There is no skill that is useless to level.The community is very friendly. If you have questions, there is almost always someone willing to help you out.The developer is constantly working on the game and releasing updates.The game is considered to be 21+ which allows for some very funny moments.As of 12/23/16, the game is in it's beginning stages of progression. If you start now, most of the first pick names are available, and the players aren't very far ahead of you. Players are currently avoiding most PvP in favor of working together to get ahead.The item descriptions are hilarious.Cons:The game is still in beta and has its bugs. None of them are game breaking though.The game is so addicting it can eat up all of your time! Maybe this isn't a con.Some of the basics aren't intuitive and may require you to ask for help in one of the public chat channels. The community is very helpful thoughThe wiki is primarily in Russian at the moment. Google translate does a good job, but there are still some issues with the translation.Some of the item descriptions aren't very descriptive and require you to actually make the item to figure out what it does.The game is still very new and has a small community. With the dedication of the Dev along with the great premise for the game, I am sure this will soon change.Conclusion:I have been working on every aspect of the game in my time played and I am thoroughly happy with all of it. There are a few bugs here and there, but nothing more than a slight inconvenience. The Dev is often logged in and actively talking to chat, and is immensely helpful when it comes to technical questions. I don't want to give the wrong idea, but this game is like a combination of runescape for the graphics style, skills, and PvP, and Terraria or Minecraft for the survival aspect along with focus on building up your home base.This game is a solid 8/10 in my book. It is doing everything right. As a long time MMO player, I have been unable to get into any MMO for the last few years, and this is the first one to really appeal to me in a long time. Plus the game is pretty cheap, with no monthly fees."

Game is very forgiving for a veteran of HnH, death has very little consequences until late game, and there is simply no framework for crime and punishment, as claims are completely inpenetrable, making walls useless.EDIT: Devs delete all critiscism and suggestions that trigger him too, so his game won't get any better with development"

I have 380+ hours on steam and prolly three times that just on the browser because the browser runs way smoother. Some nice things i have to say are - the game has a very good farming mechanics, thats about really. It was updated regulary, but those where mostly just new/reworked sprites.Pros- Good farming mechanic- ???Cons- No population if on EU server- Japan server has very low pop 30ish people maybe- Dev spends more time deleting forum posts then anything else- PvP non-existent- Dev doesnt care about player feedback ex. when suggesting something he will refer to play or dont play policy- Nothing to do after reaching max stats- Updates consist mostly of newer sprite models- Poor performance on steam client version- Too much grinding for too little of an outcome- Feed your character food simulator- Unforgiving for new players- too many more to listNow I know its early access, but this game should not have a price tag on it, theres barely enough to keep you playing for even a free game. I suggest wait a few more years and maybe it gets better and maybe not."
76561198006684815,Not Recommended,528460,29772612,Posted: 7 February,all,Chaos,"I really gave this game an honest go - I wanted to like it. I enjoy games like this - where you craft and build your way up. However there's a few things that buyers need to beware of.First, the graphics and gameplay is quite .. well ... look at the screenshots. But that's ok. The fences don't auto blend into each other its as though each tile is it's own entity. Again - this is fine. I found a horse which is rare I was told, and put it into a pen so no one would steal it. I logged off and came back on, and the horse was dead. Why? Because I didn't feed it apples. Nothing told me I needed to feed it apples. The pen was grass, and last I checked horses will eat grass and forage. They don't simply fall over dead.But ok. So, I looked into the progression. To advance in the game, you eat foods which enable you to increase stats as you perform actions. However, you can only eat so often without overeating. When you die, you come back full. The mechanics are a bit weird, but I enjoy weird.However, I had to draw the line when I got plague and died after waiting about an hour for my food to go down enough to eat something so I could raise my skills further. How did I get the plague you ask? By rinsing off dirt looking for worms. Yep. Dirt carries plague apparently which makes no sense at all - plague was transfered via ticks from rats and other hosts. Plague doesn't just spring up when you wash dirt. You need worms to fish.After dying and having my hunger reset to full again, I realized that this game isn't just a grind, but it's engineered to slow your progress in any way it can, with rediculous mechanics that make no sense at all for a survival game.Perhaps its because its in early access - but I cannot recommend this game to anyone and, if I could, I would get a refund."
,Recommended,528460,31139551,Posted: 14 April,all,Chimarine,"A lot of the bad reviews are people who didn't ask questions and give it enough of a chance. The hunger being slow is on purpose, it's not a level to 100 in a day kind of game. And there is enough to do as you get going. Gut corpses people leave laying around to make small sacs, then make some drying racks/tanning tubs. A well situated claim can fit dozens of these.Movement can be a little awkward around the trees and boulders and such in the open world, but if you click rotate wasd in settings, and just walk around things it's not that bad. I'm rarely wandering around the overworld these days anyway.As for what food to eat, there are posts on Reddit and such just ask in game for the link I don't have it immediately i'll probably update this if I remember with some links. There are stat calculators and a lot of the higher end food is really good stats and all of it is bought off the in game auction house. Players can hire new players to plow or do some odd jobs for early money. Once you find something that you're good at and like, you can make a lot of coin just killing monsters and selling food items. It's a beautiful game and I do love it."
76561198109620485,Recommended,528460,31577646,Posted: 6 May,all,merserie,"This game is fun, it reminds me of games I used to play like UO, RPGWO, Runescape etc. The graphics and movement are a a but clunky but improvements are being made all the time. Crafting is in depth, but fun and achievable.You claim some land, build, plant, mine, raise animals and expand, there is PVP and you can lose everything pretty easily especially in Mines, however I've managed to recover all my stuff every time i've died so far, with a little perseverance!The one main thing to do when you start, is to ask on chat for help if you need it, there are some really helpful players who will get you started and help you find a good place to set up a claim.When you set up your first claim, either ask on chat or have a good run around the map as there are quite a few abandoned claims that have useful items on them which helps out at the start.Oh and run away from wolves/ anything with a red name, they will kill you until you can get some armor."
76561198043508390,Recommended,528460,28552141,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,jeremy,"Lots of crafting, usage based skill progression, claim a plot of land, build everything from the ground up. Has a UO type of feel to it so far, with some fun, humorous additions, such as crafting cigs, joints, overeating till ya have to use the toilet or puke, has a hooker in the inn.Helpful community that is willing to answer questions. Responsive developers.One core aspect of this game is your plot of land. You can claim one anywhere on the map and expand its size. There is rent based upon the size of your plot. Fail to pay rent and your claim is in danger. You can plant seeds, harvest crops, build a house, craft forges and other tools, make chicken pens, raise cows. Your claim is a refuge where you cannot be pked. You can surround it with fences to keep other players out of it if you wish.The crafting system is hardcore. For example, if you want to craft a shield for combat, you must gqther materials to craft a knife, then create an axe, chop down a tree, chop the tree into a log, craft a saw, use the saw to turn the log into boards, use the knife to harvest raw hide, craft a dryer rack to dry the rawhide, craft a tanning tub and tan the hides, then buy or craft nails, then combine them all. That is if you have the required skill level.There are many different recipes under the categories of Carpentry, Metalworking, Leatherworking, Stoneworking, Mining, Lumberjacking, Pottery, Tailoring, Mechanics, Alchemy, Survival, Farming, Fishing, Herbalism, Cooking and Leadership.There is so much to already do in this Early Access game, it really is a sandbox. Want to Pk, or get strong and fight the Pks (so far there hasn't been much Pk action - I've yet to be attacked.), want to have a farm, or craft goods for the auction, have a player vendor on your land, you can.As for the dungeon type of experience, there do not seem to be dungeons out of the box. Instead players with mining can create a mine entrance and explore the underworld where tougher mobs spawn and rarer ores and gems can be harvested. These can go down multiple levels.There is a lot here for the cheap price. As a sandbox however, you must bring your own fun and define your own experience - which is how I like it."

The graphics  arent top notch but theyre good, which isnt the important part of a game like this. What is important is content. The crafting system so far seems pretty good. There are a lot of skills to use, building, carpentry,fishing,farming, fighting herbalism and many more. The ambient sounds are very relaxing which I find to be a plus on a grindy mmo like this, so far it doesnt seem to be a terrible grind either. It reminds me of runescape but without the hackers and bots with open world game play. For an early stage mmo sandbox game this is one of the better ones for my tastes. The small community of players are friendly and helpful too."

I'm loving every second of the game. Community is great and the developers are very active and will answer all of your questions if they're around. Game has tons of potential. This game is like Ultima Online had a baby with Stardew Valley.
76561198002568196,Recommended,528460,29475159,Posted: 24 January,all,Reiia,"Caution.  If you aren't willing to spend hours establishing your base and slowly growing at the start to have a easier time.  You won't like this game.  This game isn't for people who wants to build a giant base in less than an hour.   There is grind, not everything is perfect, but the developer is active and frequently responds to every forum post.Game play is similar to that of Haven and Hearth, but claims are not ""attackable"" or raidable.  Therefore it is your safe haven.  PvP is open season as you go down the Z axis in the ""caves""  while you can still pvp on the surface, but with a reduction in damage.  The ""Tiered"" world>cave1>cave2>etc system works well as the deeper you go into caves, the higher ther rewards with rare metals, however you can get pk'd more easily.Crops, raising animals, will take days.  Such as wheat is 36 hour rotation.  It is a blessing and a curse, but that means you aren't stuck playing ""crop simulator"" nonstop if your farm grows in size.   Community is generally friendly, however always suffers from several trolls.Game is def still a early access game, however for a survival game in this kind of isometric genre type, it is fairly well developed.  As of today, there is a large update coming soon that will update the graphics more, add more items, and polish more mechanics.There is a fairly large Japanese population/fanbase to this game."

Quite relaxing, and with a small but friendly community.Tutorial is quite short and online resources are mostly in russian so far, but the developper is creating an english version quite far (i'm only talking about the wiki; actual game is in english, ofc). This lack of guidance can be confusing, but people will definitely help you if you got questions.Bonus point: this is a fresh server, created with steam launch, so you won't compete with veteran players.Bonus 2: the developper seems to be attached to a good economic model, aka buy to play + cosmetic only in game shop.(My in game name is ""Geralt"")"

Now however, I don't.The game feels like it lacks a direction, and the development can be pretty silly at times.Maybe the game will be fully enjoyable when it's completed - if it ever does.Advice: Don't invest in this game yet, because by the time you reach what I'd imagine most other players like myself consider the endpoint, you'll be hugely disappointed and feel like you wasted time.Also I got permenantly banned from Rogalia discussions for offering to give away my items.Here's a picture:http://imgur.com/a/TOBUrOh, and I got banned from the game too.And I got banned from the Discord when simply asking why I was banned.So immature.EDIT: You banned me for offering to give people my items.

I live in China, wouldn't recommend it to others in this region as the lag resulted in some pretty profound rubber-banding. I would click on a space, my guy would walk there, then he would snap back to his original place, then walk there again on his own.I'm certain this is simply on account of my location in regards to the server.As for the gameplay, it seemed pretty neat, very similar to Project Zomboid. The art style was retro Ultima style, the menues were right click to select style.I would say the only thing that was off about the game was that some of the ingame text looks like it was run through Google Translate, so it wasn't impossible to understand, only a little... off...All that aside, if you're into the Project Zomboid style game, or if you enjoyed Ultima Online, way back in the day, there's probably lots to like about this game.The community was also very polite and helpful, which is pretty important for a game where everyone's on the same server."

And then you just kind of plateau. And now there is nothing left to do...And by this I mean there is A LOT more to do...but would take weeks to get to it. The eating for nutrients thing is pretty stupid. You have to wait to be hungry again. And barely get anywhere in stats. There are no guides out there with a lot of information on the game, and that's okay I figured out most of it on my own, and it made it more fun. But even the enjoyment of that kind of fizzled out. I love the concept, I love this kind of game, I find the grinding to get places to be okay. I think unlocking new things is exciting! But it shouldn't take as long as it does. It needs a lot of refinement in that section. I feel as though I got my money's worth out of the game. I just wanted to go further, and it became apparent that proceeding at the rate I was going wasn't going to be any fun.Biggest issue is how to gain stats. It takes too long, you have to wait to be hungry again, and you don't gain much from the food that is easily accessible when starting out. And if you want to do a little of everything it holds you back even more in terms of stat gain.I partially recommend the game. I truly enjoyed 28 hours in it! And that is quite a bit of entertainment! But I want to go further!!! And it's too difficult in my opinion."

The servers location also causes latency issues if you don't live near Europe. The map is small, for a survival mmo, very small, if they got an influx of players, 300 (current server cap?) on that tiny map will cause havoc and mayhem. Shame there is no dedicated server software.Repeatedly catching the edge of impassible objects.Getting many lag spikes, using a gaming rig, it shouldn't be too hard to keep up with this 1990~2000's theme game.You'd expect elements like the Journal, or map would slot/snap/fit in the screen border, but alas, most don't.UI/Control of the game overall feels very clunky, slow and tedious, not to mention there's no scaling, the text for me is hard to read, I'm visually challanged.I imagined this would be like HnH(Heaven and Hearth), I'd say HnH still has the upper hand here, at least for the moment, who knows, may get better."

If you like grinding, base building, with an open world pvp environment, with full inventory drop at higher levels, then this game will be for you. That being said, if you like the grind of base building but do not like pvp, do not let the above turn you off as I have not had any player attack me and have not seen one player attacked that were not flagged for open attack based on the games karma system.The karma based system is pretty nice in the way it deals with aggressive acts on non aggressive players. If you commit acts, that the game developer has deemed aggressive, you lose karma. When you are in the negative karma you become open for anyone to attack freely. If you are positive karma then people will be punished for attacking you with negative karma and the map allows you to track all negative karma players on the screen while all players with positive karma are hidden.The top pvpers I have found to be super helpful and some even employ new playyers to do their low level material grinds for them which really helps new players get a foot off in the game. This is something the is rarely in games therefore it is not the standard, which speak positively about a game in mind. And to boot, the community has been extremely helpful in my short time in game.Overall I would give this game, considering it is early access and how active the one developer is in game dealing with the player base and their suggestions, a solid 4.5 out of 5 stars"

But after a few hours of research about the game, I gave this game another chance and well it's worth it. There's so much to do in this game. I am a farmer but I have yet enjoy the farming mechanic in the game since I'm busy with my studies. You will be excited to wait for your plants and crops as it takes a few days to grow. I am currently building my own house and it takes lots of patience as I need to cut down a lot of trees and replanting them requires quite some time.It's a great game that everyone should enjoy it!"

Every game has its early days that lead to greatness, each day more people discover it and add to its community.  I believe this game is one of those.  It's still in early stages but I knew as soon as I saw it in early access that it was gonna be new favorite game.  Due to it's age each player is appreciated and valued, and can add to the game. The game is being developed by 2 really dedicated people, I fully recommend giving the game a try, please remember thats still in early stages.  Hope to see you ingame.   :)"
