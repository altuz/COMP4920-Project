,Recommended,528510,25720664,"Posted: 26 September, 2016",all,WidescreenRules,"The best way to describe this silly game would be that Super Mega Neo Pug, Minecraft, and a regular infinite runner like ""Temple Run"" had a massive orgy and all of their DNA fused together to splurt out this baby -- and it's such a cute baby!Like its predecessor, it's a fun time waster. There's no story, no plot, no massive goal -- just jump to stay alive. And jump really is all that you do. Unlike SMNP where you held the button to fly up and released it to drop down, with TP3D you jump. That's it.The graphics are voxel-based like Minecraft but smooth as silk. If you have a rig that can support it, turning all of the graphics to ""epic"" gives you an amazing draw distance and gorgeous day/night effects.My only ""complaint"" is that Turbo Pug 3D is actually NOT 3D-compatible. (EDIT: Yes, I am FULLY aware that that's not the reason for ""3D"" in the title.)  I was really hoping to see this in NVIDIA's stereoscopic 3D mode. My heart was set on seeing the distance go w-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-y back into the screen, but - alas! - it doesn't work. Maybe they can work on that for a future update.Anyway, if you need a fun, silly, and challenging time killer, this game should fit the bill -- for only two dollar bills."

Sometimes you press the jump button and nothing happens, other times you press the button and the damn dog jump a second too later. A side-scrolling-endless-runner shouldn't have FPS drops, but this one manages to. I bought this game for my friends, and now I feel like a morron for exposing them to this dogshit.Please save your money, and buy a real pug."

Such as maybe single use power ups you can purchase with coins as, now that I have unlocked the crown, I am just collecting coins for nothing which feels a bit useless.The jump is also a bit buggy/laggy for me at times causing me to die but overall the game is decent, good for a casual play.edit: gonna change it to not reccomended until the jump lag is fixed because it's annoying and frustrating when you keep dying because of it"

,Not Recommended,528510,26323086,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,Zee Zaa Zo,Personally I feel there is more to life than Pugs but not the developers who keep dishing out the same Pug again and again.    I assume they have a brain but when I see Pug after Pug I have to really question if they do...  Good for me though as I now know to avoid any and everything from this developer...  Choice is a wonderful thing!

It's one of those endless runner type games where you play as a cute pug and collect coins.My only issue with this game is that it is VERY laggy. I hope that this is fixed in an update, as it could really elevate the gameplay from good to great."
