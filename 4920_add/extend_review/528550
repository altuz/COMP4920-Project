,Recommended,528550,32207163,Posted: 5 June,all,byteframe,"Whoa doggy! Git er done. Drinking brown party liquor!While clearly overpriced, this title delivers. It uses some strange ragdoll gravity physics, that seems to make it a fun punching game, and it is this strange kind of slow motion brawl. The fighting is good, everybody is falling to the floor and coming back up at you. If you fall to the floor, you will lose, unless I missed how to get back up into the fight. It has an internet radio jukebox, a diversity of avatars, and a cool environment. It's good, and you will enjoy the fighting, too much I think. Of all the games I've played with my Vive, none of them seemed more likely to have me break my controller than this one. Boost your chaperone bounds visibility and distance, and be careful. Party game or no, don't demo this game to a noob, or else they will break your controller, which is worse than if you did it yourself.Also, you spelt 'Drunken' wrong. Even if on purpose, this is bad for visibility and search.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=892732109"

Brilliant workout.Got to say though, there is a long way to go to make this a decent game sorry.Fighting is much more fun when you have a reason.Here is a few things i reckon would make this alot bettter.Start with a confrontation.Even choose dialog to say to start the biff.Have the AI talk♥♥♥♥♥♥to you. Egg you on.Have diffuclty levels and improve the hit management.Sometimes the best hits you do don't land and you get knocked out bya AI from them what looks like pushing and slapping you.Shouldn't get knocked out by pathetic or ill placed hits that wouldn't really do♥♥♥♥♥♥in a normal fight.And why are the same two AI's come at you. Wouldn't be hard to put a random placement of AI inat the start of each fight.Anyway, this alot more fun than alot of the games available now for the vive, and it would be a completewaste if it wasn't drastically improved.Have fun punching on!"

I reach over grab a stool and whack said chump before his taunt ends. As his ragdoll body falls to the floor I jump on him and start slamming his head on the ground. He gets up to recover I reach behind me grab a dart from the board and land it right in his eye! I played this game for about 15 minutes before I had to take my head set off. Not because of motion sickness but becuase I was laughing so hard I didn't want to soak the goggles with tears. This is one of the most funny and entertaining games I've ever played. Even in it's early state this game is lots of fun and has great replayability. The developers need to work on hit detection and add to the grabbing/throwing system but still worth the buy right now.

Ironically one of the most immersive VR games because you can look down and see your body and legs, and the arms are connected too.  I hope the developer adds more minigames or goals to achieve, because it is basically a sandbox, but is well-made and enjoyable- just don't expect more than a drunken bar fight."

It was the most fun I've had in VR, better than Knockout League and Super Hot in my opinion. It also provided a great sense of presence, I think it's the unpredictable nature of the NPCs and their physics on contacting your first or the floor, great fun in real time!!!

Really funny!The only thing that could have been better were having more body sensors to be able to kick and knee people during the fight. But, we're talking the hardware limitation rather than the game. The developers did a great job on this.The game on its own is well worth the purchase price."

I think a few times I saw someone have a psychological breakthrough and yell out a co-worker's name while beating in somebody's face.  Some of the stuff we have yelled while hitting the bar patrons has been priceless and well worth the cost of the game.  Sometimes it's just fun to fight.  'nuff said.

,Recommended,528550,31933020,Posted: 24 May,all,rudy50dragon,"SUPER FUN, despite whatever bugs you want to point out in it. The gameplay is where it's at- grabbing drinks, throwing bottles, barstools, darts, and PEOPLE! hahaha. What's not to love.Now from the nit picky side or the request for developers side- fix this dude's legs! Also, I'm hoping there will be some character look customization available at some point.  Make the opponents more . . . destructible? If they have glasses/sunglasses, let me knock them off. Maybe clothes tear here and there.  And maybe at a rated M version where we can break a bottle and then gash some people, that would be awesome haha. Oh, and if I can punch people into the windows and the windows break, I want these fools flying out the windows into the street. Maybe that could be an extension of the game- moving the fight outside into the immediate vicinity of the bar on the street. And THEN you could add dodging oncoming traffic into the mix. XDFrom a youtuber point of view- let the first person point of view be the default so I don't have to do the ""one-eye"" mirror mode to give viewers a good perspective of the game. Also, make turning off the sound track an option. As much as I love going down the 90s memory lane with the music, they're going to get us flagged for copyright everytime.Really hope to see new bars and new characters at somepoint.Anyway, I seriously enjoy this game and if this is all it ever ends up being, for $12 I'd be okay with that. Not thrilled, but okay.Thanks!"

It's not even close. The fighting is not at all rewarding. There's no strategy to it. You have arms in game, and your controllers are inside the forearms making it very awkward to control. As far as physics and graphics it reminded me of Goat Simulator, and not in the '' it's so bad it's fun '' way. There's about 10 minutes worth of game play, and nothing to make you want to play again once you win. This is a 99¢ game at best, $12 is insulting."

It is fantastic and so much fun. However, as in every game, there are also flaws.--Pros---This game is highly addictive.-Functional jukebox? Hell yeah!-Break stools over your enemy's face!-Drink a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of beer and feel good about yourself.-If you punch somebody's face enough times, they actually get bruised and damaged. It's actually awesome.-You can throw darts at people and it actually sticks in them.-Since the game's lighting is a little dark, you can actually see your play zone boundaries, unlike SOME crappy brawlers. (Fist Of Physics, i'm looking at you.)There are dozens of other pros that I could go on with, but we should probably get on with the cons.--Cons---One whole bar fight ends in about an hour. Then you have to restart and drink over and over again until you're as strong as possible and you get attacked by the same weak characters again.-The asian character can be beaten within 3 good placed punches, and sometimes even one huge uppercut.-The bald guy gets annoying with the amount of times he ducks and dodges before you can finally break his face in.-The characters don't have dialogue. They groan when you punch them, but all them groan in the same voice. It's especially weird when you knock the old lady off her feet and she yells with pain in a guy's voice.-There is only one bar to fight in, which gets repetitive sometimes.Overall, this game is HELLA fun. I know I made more cons than I did pros, but that can be good sometimes. The game can be improved, which it really doesn't even need to be. I'm surprised this game is in early access, especially with how well the game runs and how smooth the punches are. I'm excited to see what else they do with this game and I can't wait to play it as it improves!"

The only problem I have with this game is that there is now a phone feature that allows you to invite friends, and it is overly accessible. I invite 5 or 6 friends to play anytime I play this game by accident. It sends them a message that says ""Hey UsernameExample, meet me at the bar."" At first, I thought someone had access to my steam account and was randomly inviting my friends to the bar. I wish they would change the button to invite people. Please becareful out there, and dont punch anyone in the crotch!"

I drank down four beers and a bottle of wine, grabbed a bar stool and started swinging.  It took a few good blows to get the guy down, but once he did I wasn't done because even more people started trying to mess with me.  I began throwing bottles at their faces to keep them away, but one guy knew karate or something and knocked me to the ground.  It seemed as if an invisible hand lifted me off the floor as I got my second wind.  I turned to the jukebox and quickly put on something with some good speed, which got me pumped, but in my drunken stupor I accidently hit the Christmas station.  With ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" blaring I threw several darts into the face of my attacker, and then brought another bar stool down on his head.Anyway, later I came home and played Drunkn Bar Fight and it was pretty cool."
76561198043541512,Not Recommended,528550,28105879,"Posted: 30 November, 2016",all,Crusher Carlson,"Not recommended (yet).  I love the premise and intial content makes sense but the control is brutal.  Hit detection is more frustrating than satisfying.  At this time it's far easier to hit someone with a thrown bottle than land a punch, however, picking something up can be difficult when you or your bottle are getting caught on the bar counter.  Fun over realism should be the point here.  Make it so that your arms/ body can travel through objects in the environment rather than getting caught on them.  When you grab something to pick it up, the item should also travel through objects in the environment.  Getting stuck on things and repeatedly swinging through faces until the hit detection landed a hit ruined the fun.  Perfect example, when you grab a pool stick, you have to carefully lift it without it getting caught on the wall holder or your grip slips off of it.Great idea, needs major improvements to be more fun than frustrating."
,Not Recommended,528550,28046217,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,gamefreak113,"Hmm. It's a fun little game, but very lackluster for the price. You just whirl around your arms in the hopes of hitting people and knocking them out. And you drink. Rinse & Repeat. After each 'match' you 'discover' moves, but I don't find it interesting as you're just flailing about.Fun little gimmicky game for a few bucks, but not for this price.The controls are wonky, the people fumble around and the grabbing and throwing does not feel right.I do love the 'being knocked out and straighten yourself' mechanic, but other than that, nothing really stands out.There is no clear idea what is needed to win; I just stayed in the beginning of the bar, knocking people around and drinking eternally respawning bottles of beer while trying to grab the pool cues (which cannot be grabbed during a fight whatsoever, only when having the patience and time before the fight). Worth a chuckle, but not a keeper.The devs really need to up their game for this to be worth the current price."

,Recommended,528550,29708211,Posted: 4 February,all,Barak the Magik Seakow,"In my first ten minutes playing this, I almost considered refunding it.  Like many others reviewing, I was hoping/expecting for a bar fight style game like ""gorn."" This is not that game.  This game feels much more like an accurate boxing game than a mindless beat em up like gorn (don't get me wrong though, I LOVE gorn. This is just a very different type of game).  Some of the actions you can do- IE: Smashing a stool or bottle over someone's face, jamming a dart in their eye, backhanding them and making them fly across the room, feels brutal and satisfying enough that even when I'm alone, I'll scream ""OOOOOOH S**T THAT WAS BRUUUUTAL!!""  This game, like other boxing-style games, actually gives me quite a solid workout.  There's really not much more to say about the game.  There's only one thing that's half-pro and half-con; the game starts out unbelievably hard.  You'll be thinking ""oh god how is anyone not horrible at this.""  However, once you fully grasp the game's mechanics (ironically, I had a couple shots of gin in real life, and that is when I had this realization), it doesn't just become easy- you can immediately beat the game.  It goes from outright impossible, to WAY too easy.  This would be ok if the game actually functioned as a survival (high score-esque) type game.  However, there IS a boss battle- the bouncer.  Once you knock out the bouncer, the game is over.  I'm not a huge fan of this.  However, the game is overall extremely fun, extremely brutal, relatively funny, and gives a nice workout.  For $12, I'd highly recommend."

76561198042913113,Not Recommended,528550,29346949,Posted: 18 January,all,caidicus,"I have some serious doubts about the development team behind this game. I wrote a forum post about how I felt the monthly subscription for commercial use seemed greedy and toxic to the development of the VR industry.Basically, I said that VR bars are almost always dead inside, and if all developers start charging what is basically ""rent"" for their games to be used in these establishments, then VR will have an even harder time reaching the public.The developer added me as a friend on Steam, and I was impressed that they took that step. They then told me not to tell anyone what they were about to tell me, after which they went on to blame me for any negative reviews they got on Steam, tell me I don't know how hard it is to be a developer, and then he (Keith) told me he personally spent $150k developing this game over the last six months.After playing the game, it looks like it was thrown together in Unity by someone who doesn't really know how to code yet. The point isn't that the game sucks, it's fun if you want to punch someone in the face and drink virtual beers, it's just that it's extremely unpolished and the main dev thinks that his game is some sort of national treasure.Anyway, here's what he said to me in a direct message on Steam, before deleting me and then deleting my original post because he didn't want anyone to see how unprofessional he was.keith.munky: Dude!!!!     You make some very good points!     It is easy to see you care about the VR community.Let’s both agree that it is everyone's responsibility to help establish a VR retail presence.    BTW, it is a stretch (from a content creator’s POV)  but I personally totally buy into it.    If we build a strong retail presence it will benefit the community as whole.But, I said that it looks like the industry is moving towards a “pay per minute” model, so why are you still talking about $20 an hour?     Let’s move the discussion towards what is a fair price per minute.     From what I have heard the current target for VR bars is $1 a minute….. Don’t quote me, it is just what I have heard.   So, what is a fair price for the content?   10%, 50%...... of that dollar?   What do you think?     Do you know what movie studios get for each ticket sold at theaters?   From what I hear they get most of it.   Theatres have the opportunity to make profit off concessions and Studios need the revenue to invest in new pictures.You said “ It should be enough that the company pays you to buy the game from you, for each and every system they host in their building”    Really?    Have you thought that through?   Do theaters buy the DVD and have permission to show the movie?   No?   Why not?You understand that unless the content creators make money, there won’t be content right?Again, I am with you…..  I agree content creators should be generous in the beginning to establish the market.   I almost could buy the argument that retail could serve as the “free” in the FTP model.    But, we need to show or at least believe that retail engagement drives software sales….    Does playing Pac Man in the arcade lead to the user buying Pac Man games for home……   seems like it does.    But, even Namco charged for the game.    It wasn’t free to the arcade owners.You seem very sympathetic to the retailers POV.    Let me give you a little more info about the content creator.    Hopefully you will gain a more balanced perspective.Very few people are making a profit developing VR titles.     The top folks are just doing “OK”.   Everyone else is losing their shirt.     Every publisher I have spoken to is backing away from investing in the space.      Private investment has either stopped or is drying up.Do you know why you are hearing about Job simulator making $3M, Onward being invited to Valve or Survios getting investment capital?    They are unicorns.    Those are the top titles.  Those guys took huge financial risks and delivered.     But, they are only making a fraction of what a decent console or mobile title can make.    You are right to say “VR is in a fragile state” but that goes double for content creators.You chose to pick on an Indie?    I personally have lost a lot of $ doing this.   And although it is stupid, I will continue to do it because it is the most fun I have had in my entire 30 year career.Run the numbers yourself.     What does it cost to make a game?     What price do you sell it at and how many do you think you can sell in a crowded market space and a low install base.   Tell me what you come up with.    It ain’t pretty.Here is an example:150K install base$10 a unit3% attach rate (average attach rate is much much lower)$200 dev budget0.03 * 150K * $10 = $45,000.    Oh no, we just worked 6 months and lost $150K.So, as far as I know, the development community has stepped up.   What about the consumer?   OK, I agree…. Anybody who ponied 800 simoleons to play a short list of decent titles is a trooper.   But that is a very very short list of people!   How many Vives in the market?   <200K?   The market is miniscule and completely fragmented.     The Vive consumer is a pioneer but there are very few of them.You didn’t even buy my $12 game but you felt entitled to post on my game’s community page that I am acting “ridiculous”, “underhanded”, “toxic” and I am trying to “cash grab”.      How is that helping?    I now have people posting “Cash grab game” in my reviews thanks to your post.My game is not even finished and you are in my space, where I am trying to eek back the money I have invested,  complaining that I am not giving enough to the community.    When I have personally given more time and cash than is rational.Your good intentions are actually doing more harm than good…… at least to me.I know you are trying to help and letting me know how the consumer feels but you should consider what it takes to make content for these systems.       We have been working 60 hour weeks for the last 6 months and we have been losing money in the hopes of establishing a market.     Please continue to bring fair intelligent discussion but stop bagging on those that are actually working hard trying to make fun♥♥♥♥♥♥for you.As you can see, he went from polite to angry to whining to blaming me to angry again, all without a single reply from me.Sadder still, this dev seems to support the idea that pay structures like ""price per minute of play"" are a good for the future of VR.I think lots of people enjoy this game, as you can see by their reviews and the game's approval rating. My only concern is that the dev is extremely unprofessional, which makes me doubt whether the game will ever get much better than it is now.The dev deleted my original post in order to silence my opinions about the pricing of the game, so in less than a week, he's already shown himself to be the kind of dev who will delete anything which doesn't make his game look good.That, to me, is a warning sign about the developer. His communication methods remind me a lot of Digital Homicide, and that makes me very uncomfortable."

It's such a simple, great game as is though.TIP: When hooked up to a TV, click-hold and drag around the screen to get different third-person views of the person in the VR. The third-person feature is nice because the audience doesn't get motion sickness from watching in first-person.Also, slide around by using the big thumb button as a D-pad to move around the bar.
