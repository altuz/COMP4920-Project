,Not Recommended,528640,30521739,Posted: 15 March,all,sCriv,"1.) The positives:If Rugby is your favourite sport, this is the best Rugby management sim currently  available to buy.The general feel of the game is pretty good - the layout is very simple and it doesn't take you too long to get used to navigating your way around and working out each little game facet..The player/league database is pretty accurate and up-to-date, although only certain teams from certain leagues are licensed (Aviva Prem, Pro 12, Top 14) and for some reason if you decide to coach international sides, the player's names are not licensed when they are called up to their international squads (something which I found slightly bewildering).Some of the competitions are also not licensed, eg: the Six nations is called the ""NH Nations"" - but if you can get past the lack of full licensing, this IS an enjoyable game.You can take over a club - build your club facilities, set your own tactics, bring through and cultivate your own youth teams, sign/loan players - even set your own ticket prices. I have spent many enjoyable hours so far, and I would normally reccommend a game like this -  however:2.) The negatives:If you are looking at this game, hoping for a Rugby Manager sim which is similar in style and execution to the Football manager game series - think again.  This is absolutely nothing like Football manager, it is clearly years behind in it's development.First of all, the tactical side of the game I found massively wanting - you only have the option of setting extremely basic game tactics.   You can manually select players for line-out and scrum, but that is about it.As a result, I quickly found a tactical system within about 1 hour of game time which was almost unbeatable, and with an average Northampton Saints team which has struggled in real life, I went the whole calendar year unbeaten, winning the treble in my first season. I repeated this feat for the next three seasons, using the same tactics, and almost the same players.I then took over as Italy manager and won the six nations grand slam at the first time of asking using the same tactics, beating england 40-0 in the process.Basically, this lack of in-depth tactics has made the game incredibly easy to beat - it is just not challenging or realistic whatsoever in this regard, which I thought was a a massive shame, as there is the basis of a good game there.The second major negative point is the 3-D match engine.  Far from the crisp graphics and smooth flow of the Football manager series, the 3-D engine on Rugby union Team Manager is one of the worst I've ever seen in a sports sim game.The players run around randomly, rucking at random intervals.  This chaos leads to an enormous amount of glitches, the most common of which are passes which go about 10 feet forwards yet are still counted as legal, and nearly always lead to a try. There is also a glitch which occurred in about 30% of my matches where sometimes a player would get possession of the ball, and run 50 metres the opposite way down the pitch to his own try line, and the ref would blow for a scrum to the other team in the try zone - sometimes even blow a try to the opposing team!When you're in the opposition try zone powering towards a 78th minute try to win the game and this happens to you, it's incredibly frustrating.The only positive thing about the 3-D  match day engine is the team call system which is used - it makes for an interesting dynamic, but is incredibly frustrating to me because like the general game mechanics, there is the basis of a good game there, it just needs massive development.Overall, if you're a fan of Rugby, this is an enjoyable game, but it is so mind-numbingly easy and  incredibly riddled with bugs and glitches, that it is not worth it unless you are a seriously big fan of the sport like I am.At £29.99, this game is almost the same price as Football Manager, but it is absolutely light years behind it in terms of the experience it offers. I say this - don't waste your money."

,Recommended,528640,27662599,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,tgbrock,"10hrs GP:I've played the game for 10 hours now and I have so far only experienced one bug, so I'm not sure what other people are doing, maybe it's their OS? The menus aren't very laggy, taking less than a second for each click to respond and load the corresponding request, so I don't really know how much quicker people want it?The game is very enjoyable, and is definitely like many other strategy games, I've just reached Christmas and I've now got a set tactical game plan, and I've promoted a few academy players. I've slowly overhauled my staff and the team training is much more effective.I think the problem is, because the game looks rough, it's hard to see past this on first viewing. It's the same as every game, when you get used to the interface, everything is quicker and you look past what it looks like and instead focus on what it does.Would still recommend!2hrs GP:Right, firstly I need to say this will be a working review even though I am reviewing after 2 hours, because I feel there needs to be some balance after seeing the first couple of reviews.It's rough and ready, but it's good. You can't compare it to Football Manager and their level of detail as they have much more money and have been developing the game over decades, not a couple of years. Plus rugby is far more complex in terms of tactics and positioning.The database is a bit iffy, Manu Tuilagi has around 40 power, and Harry Thacker has apparently reached his potential at the age of 22. However, I restarted the game a few times, and the attributes and potentials changed for just about all the players. So I feel the game may have a randomiser similar to Football Manager where it randomises some attributes to create an original experience each time you start a game. It creates an air of luck, it is a game and you can't expect to replicate real life exactly.When playing, there isn't a database of players, you must scout for the position/team/league, and then view the players from there. This for me is more realistic: attributes, value, potential, injures etc. all change from day to day, so it doesn't make sense to have a spreadsheet full of players, you need to scout them!My favourite feature is during the match, you can choose the kind of kick off, choose the play you're going to do off your set piece, and choose what to do for a penalty. Which gives you much more control compared to just watching the players do it themselves.The match engine is a bit raw, but it's only been a few years in development, what do you expect? The defensive positioning is poor, but it is just a game, you can't expect to see or implement a Paul Gustard style blitz defence.The interface is rough and it's not the cleanest or neatest. But it is understandable at the very least and I feel I'm getting my head around it.Give the game a go, it is enjoyable, but don't expect it to blow you away."
76561198139633807,Recommended,528640,29270837,Posted: 15 January,all,kcrichards,"Was really excited to see the game available for Mac this time around and bought it at the slightly steep price of £29.99 (I think £19.99 is pobably more like it). It certainly isn't as detailed as Football manager but it has most of the features you want from a manager game and I'm pretty pleased with it overall.The main issues for me are as follows:1) The game engine isn't wonderful (I prefer 2D versions anyway). The twirly dance of doom that occasionally happens when your players kick forward is the main issue for me - the ball crosses the try line but even if you get there first you don't score the try - instead all the players dance around endlessly and you're forced to restart the game, which is annoying if you're winning!2) There are a few incorrect positions assigned to players which is maybe a tad lazy but can surely be remedied with a minor update.3) The absence of the Super 14 teams and players is a bit of a drag but again, with more licensing this can be sorted.Overall it's not perfect but it's still pretty good fun and ticks a lot of the boxes you'd expect from a sports management game. I look forward to the future updates which will make it even better."
76561198050721576,Recommended,528640,28469534,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,Graham,"I really hope that my review is able to help you; if you would like to know more, post a comment, and I will endeavour to answer.As a long time player of Cricket Captain and Football Manager, I was especially keen to get stuck into a management game focused on my beloved rugby.  I have not been disappointed - the game is really excellent, although there are a couple of things that I personally would like to see change.- I really like the interface - it is easy to navigate and easy on the eye.- From a resource management point of view, this game is excelent - one has to manage finances, staff, players, a long term plan (attempting to please the board and also grow the stature and infrastructure of one's club etc).- Tactics: I really enjoy matches and the tactical side of things, although I slightly prefer the FM (and even early Championship Manager) approach of having sliders for everything.  The team calls are fun, but I would rather have to analyse my team's strengths and weaknesses, adjust a whole host of tactics with sliders (so I don't do silly things like try creative passes with a prop etc).  There is so much potential in rugby for multiple tactical elements one can control, from individual decisions, to varying team philosophies.  Some of this is already in the game of course.  One can vary one's attack ""expansiveness"" in 12 different zones on the pitch and change one's defensive system in 4 different zones on the pitch, but I think individual instructions for each position would also be nice.- Matches: These generate realistic score-lines and are enjoyable.  If you want a hands on approach, you can ad-lib defence and attack parameters and also decide when to kick, although it seems to be difficult to clear the ball to touch!  I'd personally like the clock to operate in real time, but with ""boring"" passages of play skipped (as in Football Manager).  If this were to be altered, one would then have more stats at the end of games for things like knock ons, penalties etc.Overall though, the matches as they are, are great, but I am sure that the developers are planning to improve the player animations, movements etc with time."

Seems to crash often, the changing of players within your player squad takes forever, and your team doesn't really take on board ANYTHING you change. I understand that it hasn't had the funding that Football Manager has, but why try and basically rip off the UI of FM? Design your own, come up with your own concepts. Unfortunately I can't see a decent rugby management sim ever coming out. Companies just aren't willing to put the money and time into a game like this, when they can spit out a half decent football game and make ten times more."

First game of the season, one of ny players has the ball on his own 22.  Runs all the way back over his own try line and concedes a 5 metre scrum.  Well you don't see that very often on TV do you?Second half, have the opposition penned back inside their own 22.  One of their players runs back towards his goal line, touches down between his own posts and scores 5 points.  Not sure what is happening at this point, but while I watch amazed their number 10 claims the ball and runs the length of the field to place the ball for the conversion (at the right end this time) and adds the extra 2 points.Oh, and why do all the scrums feed from the tight head side?To say there are some issues with the 3D game is an understatement."

I think the menu layout could use a right click menu options to view specific information quickly and a pop up box explaining what each stat does within the game.One big note to developers is your 3d engine needs a massive improvement because I had to restart the game due to my players had the ball, decided to kick then suddenly every player in the match (including the opposition) started to go into a twirl like dance for the full 40 mins of the game. I could not do anything apart from restarting the game within match game menu.That the major disappointment of this game and will need to get rectified quickly.Thankfully the game has the option to simulate instead of choosing to watch the match in 3d but disappointingly even if choosing to simulate, there is no text commentary, straight to end result of the match. The 3d engine is crude, it like watching Domark's International Rugby Challenge which is bad, see reviews about the game on the internet, you get what I mean bad.It not Football Manager in terms of statistical depth of information but I feel it should be more polish for £30. Better choice text/colors to be easier on the eyes, more stats, better placement of information on-screen. It not £30 after playing the game, it should be £5 quid. If the Developers set the game at a bargin price at £5. I think you guys would have more favourable reviews and encouragements for a game that is may not be the Football Manager but not a bad attempt. If you going to set the price at £30 quid, then I expect this product to be quality not dog♥♥♥♥♥♥with bugs in the game code.£30 for a sub-par 3d engine, terrible music, terrible mouse clicking beeping sound for every menu option I click on (thankfully it can be turn off on the options menu) hard to read match anaysis, I should not need to be asked to choose team tactics which prevents the match to continue, it should continue to play either I choose a tactic or not and there are some interface design quirks within the game, for example, when checking a box to choose a specific task then I decide to uncheck the task, it would not?.It not garbage but it should be better for the price.

The scrums are just a mass of players in the same place.I can forgive the errors in the database (numerous spelling errors, positional errors and main squad players i've never even heard of for my team Newcastle Falcons) but if you're charging £25 I'd expect the engine to look better than the original Pro Rugby Union Manager which came out in something like 2005.I know it's not all about graphics, but there needs to be some form of immersion created by the depiction of the games.I really wanted this game to be great, but couldn't get past the problems with the match engine (including a bug that caused me to restart the game when all the players on the pitch were running round the ball but no one would pick it up)"

Gameplay is very poor.Overall this is certainly not a game worth paying for. In fact, if it was free I don't think it would have long term appeal either.Great shame, as I really wanted a quality rugby management game."

Well over spec for the game, but it would not run. asked steam for a refund but they felt i had played the game for more that two hours. imposible. so teh team at Alternative software spent two weeks trying to fix it. but not being anle to find a solution they have refunded me my money. I woud say purchase their software but avoid using steam if possible. so trying to get help out of steam customer ""lack of"" support was like trying to get blood out of a stone."
