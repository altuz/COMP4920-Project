,Recommended,528660,29125733,Posted: 8 January,all,Athravan,"Confession time - I received a 90% off coupon when crafting an unrelated badge; so I picked the game up for a grand total of 8 pennies. Why did I buy a game I had zero interest in realistically? Look, I'm an addict, and it has cards that sell for more - so I can make some mad crazy profits too (*cough* 15p profit... not quite enough for a Freddo anymore)!Guilt ridden for purchasing so many games that I don't play, I made an attempt at sticking to a New Years Resolution of ""Don't buy the bloody thing if you won't play it"", and I faffed around for an hour, spinning boxes and generally coming to the realization that I have bad co-ordination and am easily distracted.This game is the very essence of distraction. Bright colours, drifting shapes, flashing backgrounds and zingy music that is hyperactive at best and downright deranged at some points. It's not meant to be soothing, that much is obvious - it's meant to do everything it can to distract you from the task, and that's how it aims to pose a challenge.Coloured balls drop from the ceiling. Sometimes they say a different colour to what they are - madness! Sometimes they hit a coloured line and they change colour half way down, which plays a double mind-trick on your eyes and brain. You have to flip the box (well it starts as a simple box and progresses to a harder hexagon) and match the colours. One mistake, game over. There are a couple of game modes that affect shapes and speed that you can unlock.It's a very very simple game designed to tax your brain and eyes for an hour or two at most. It has little longevity past that point, but it should appeal to people wanting something to focus on for an hour, something to play in a study break that won't be too addictive, or for those who like achievements, as you could probably 100% the game fairly quickly if you're not a half-blind geriatric like me.Pros:Very cheap, with trading cards.Successfully challenges brain and eyes to make colour / word connections.Effective use of shapes, colours and music as distraction.Bite-size game for when you just want to distract yourself for a short period.Possible to 100% in an hour if you're an achievement lover.Cons:Short, perhaps too easy for those who are looking for a serious challenge.Play for more than an hour at a time and you'll probably get a headache.Could easily be improved with the addition of daily / all time leaderboards to add a reason to keep playing,In short, not bad - smooth controls and easy to pick up. Very cheap game to begin with, but available in sales and with coupons for much cheaper, so grab it if you're bored."

An indie ""puzzle"" and achievement hunter friendly game.Basically you have to spin a wheel to make the ball hit the right colour. It may seem difficult the first few tries but not too much (Tip: Use right and left key to spin). I think it is achievement hunter friendy because on the hard modes, the requeriments to get the achievements are SO easy.In my opinion the best mode to grind until lvl 30 is Hexagon, where scores of 150+ are easy to achieve.Enjoy the tripping!"

You have a square or hexgon (depends on gamemode) to spin & catch with the right sided color the colored dropping balls. Such as simple the game also have to offer many innovative gamemodes. Like dropping speed increase in fast mode or time mode where you have to keep on spinning your square before a timebar runsout. Main focus still stays on the upleveling. For certain levels you unlock new modes and the least the aim of reaching lvl30 seems to be a big grindfest. At some point you must get for each level around 80-160 points (depends on gamemode). Very enjoyable was the like Disney's Tron composed soundtrack tho."

The good thing this game has is a very cheap price and pretty good music. I actually liked listening to it. Apparently it also has cards and it has achievements (which I will struggle to complete eventually).The real problem with this game is the difficulty. I don't see how people can effectively improve when the game starts in pretty intermediate difficulty. There is also a lot of distraction from the lights that randomly show up during gameplay. There are many similar apps like this for free on the mobile market and unfortunately I can say this is one of those I would uninstall pretty quickly. If the developer(s) could find a way to effectuate learning and skills in this game and try to add a difficulty increase in a reasonable manner, I'd love to give this game a positive review."

Funnily enough, you start off with the hardest mode (all the other modes at once) and for each successful color ball you catch, you earn EXP which increases your level that allows you to unlock more modes. Probably would recommend playing this game in short bursts, rather than over an extended period of time since it does get repetitive very quickly. All 15 achievements won't take very long. The first 14 is obtainable within 30 minutes and the last achievement would probably take less than 2 hours.Also, a small tip: If you pause the game in the middle of a session, the color ball stops falling but you can still rotate the hexagon/square."

The music is pretty great and the gameplay is fun for the price, but there's nothing that really draws me in and wants me to keep coming back. There are several different kinds of variations on the same mechanic, but at the end of the day it's all the same thing.I got this game with a 90% off coupon and think the price I paid was pretty fair considering I made my money back on the trading cards.Not a huge fan, but like I said at $.10 I probably got my money's worth and it was at least a bit of fun."
,Recommended,528660,29503330,Posted: 26 January,all,[Hex] RottenB,"Okay, first things first, I think I got this game for around 9 Cent or so, as I used a Coupon.Secondly, this is a game that totally fits my style as I'm a dude that got every single achievement in ""Super Hexagon"", a game with a similar premise.The game in itself is totally okay for a 0.99€ game. You have a Square/Hexagon and flying orbs with a color of one side of your shape. The orbs must fly into the right color so you win a point and another orb spawns. Through time you unlock new gamemodes which are as followed:Fast ModeHexagon ModeWord ModeTime ModeTrip ModeFlip Modenot yet releasedThese levels all give lots of content that can hook you for an hour or two. Totally fine there.While I think the Gameplay is fluid and is mostly fair I do have some minor problems with the normal mode.The normal mode is (as described in the game) a mode where all other modes are combined. That's totally ok and whilst I haven't seen the Trip mode up to this point I'm kinda ok with that.The problem there lies in the switching times between modes. As an example when entering Hexagon Mode the Square has a short morphing time in which the next orb/ dot already comes flying at you but you cannot change the direction your (then Hexagon) is facing, therefore giving you more or less half the time you had beforehand for more spins.Another problem there is, that the color that faced beforehand the top/bottom changes when morphing in and out of Hexagon-mode making it impossible to predict how often you'll need to spin afterwards.But other than that I have only experienced one time while Hexagon-Mode switched off and Flip mode started in the same time that 3 orbs came at the same time with different colors... Not sure what went off there but with multiple tries I could not reconstruct that scenario after that one time...The only other thing that I think could take some improvement are the different unlockable modes. While I did enjoy most of them (except Trip Mode, bc that's literally the worst thing or I'm just too stupid) I think that it would've been more enjoyable to input them so, that the player could choose which one of them he wants to play and also play MULTIPLE AT THE SAME TIME.Personally I think that a Time+Hexagon-Mode would be perfect and up to this point it doesn't seem that there's a way to play a mode like that.So tl;dr:While the game isn't perfect it's totally worth 0,99€. If the developer implements a way to play multiple modes at the same time (while not putting all of them at random like in normal mode) I'd say I would like the game even more. But as it stands I can still recommend this game to people who crave some lil fun."

First few minutes were pretty much that, but after that you'll see the little things which you can't just ""unsee"". Most importantly the off-centered cube/hexagon annoyed me a lot, and I don't even have OCD.I'm not nitpicking, but some parts of UI weren't as much straightforward as they could be, also the UI gets messed up in lower resolution (or maybe it was because of 2K display?). During the gameplay there is quite a lot of effects, but I didn't understand the ""shattered glass"" floating up, it just didn't blend in to the overall design. Just the fading and changing colors would do the job, too.I was happy for reasonble amount of achievements until I found out how extremely easy I can get them. Even a person who never played such genre of games could consider them as easy to get. Of course not counting the last one, reach level 30 - I was really not enjoying playing the game as much at that stage. I spent 77 minutes playing this game, half of the time getting that last achievement.Please don't get me wrong, I was really hyped for this game as I love rage games, but it hasn't fulfilled my expectations. It feels like it used only half of its potential, otherwise it could be a very good game.My rating: 5/10, but for its price it is a fair deal.And by the way, who put that giant restart button to the center of the screen in pause?!"
,Not Recommended,528660,33628442,Posted: 18 July,all,MrDowntempo,"This game has a creative puzzle mechanic and flashy colorful graphics. It shuold be a solid puzzler. Unfortunetly, it has some major problems in the balance department. Certain modes are absurdly easy. You could essentially play the words mode indefinetly without losing. And then on the other end of the spectrum, there are some situations that are simply unwinable. In the normal mode, which combines the mechanics from all te other modes, this is a huge problem because it otherwise is the most interesting game mode. When the box switches to a hexagon or switches back there is a little animation, but that animation eats up time and can, in certain situations, make it impossible for you to rotate to the right color in time. Also there is one mode where you must keep turning the box, but in normal mode, there's no cue to let the player know they need to meet this requirement. This can cause frustrating defeats that don't seem fair. On top of this, there are some other minor issues, such as no volume/music sliders, just the ability to turn ALL sound on or off. Really a shame, because with a little more attention, this could be a fantastic gem of a twitch puzzle game."

,Recommended,528660,34135534,Posted: 9 August,all,Croof046,"Spin rush is a simple game for a low price. You rotate a colored square/Hexagon to match up with a colored ball coming towards you, the longer you last the more points you get. Graphics are designed to distract you with flashes movements and bright colors, especially so on ""Trip"" mode, where the cube and balls also rapidly phase between colors. Not a huge amount of content, but a few different game modes keeps it interesting for a little while. I would recommend you grab this on sale or in a bundle, if it sounds like your cup of tea."
