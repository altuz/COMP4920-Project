I did have to figure out how to fly as the small box that poped up with the arrow pointing ---> direction, once in midflight did not help me much, so I just keeped trying till I discovered the left OR right top back buttons worked with constant pressing this was how to fly, flapping Shu's wings. But its easy enough to figure out with trial and error.Game has a nice story to go, with Shu on a mission to find and save all the villagers from a very nasty storm thats approaching. The villagers have special powers to use, that will help you on your journey and beat the storm.I could not wait till christmas to try this very cute little game out. So very glad I made this purchase, even if I should have waited !Price for a new release, to me is not to bad, but maybe waiting & patients is the better option.This Game reminds me of "" Ori and the Blind forest"" but is very much differant.The music is very nice as well. :)I will need to play some more, so far really liking what I have played :)"

Sadly I don't remember his name, but a nicedeveloper of the game not only was so kind to have a little chatwith us, but also showed us some really cool behind the scenesstuff and I gotta say, that really made my day. The game was funback then, as it is now. The controls are so responsive and onpoint, it just is a blast to play. And even though I was playinglike a total idiot at the day we tried it at gamescom, I had somuch fun with it, that I knew I had to get it. Now I kinda missedwhen the game officially launched, otherwise I would've boughtit day one. It's fun, it's compelling and it's artstyle and soundtrackare the stuff of dreams. As I said, I might be biased, but I canonly recommend this game to anyone that even remotelyenjoys jump'n'runs.tl;dr: This game is one of the best indie titles to date."

Stunning artwork and amazing soundtrack with  plenty of achievements and collectables along the way and also time trail leader boards for those competitive ones.  The levels get more challenging as you progress so don't let the gentle intro fool you!Very attractive plat-former, Highly recommended!"

There are lots of achievements to get which is great for someone like me who loves achievements!! …and they are really pretty achievement badges too. The music is really nice. I died a lot on my first level but I am playing with keyboard so it is taking a bit of getting used to the controls. Overall stunning game and can’t wait to play more!

76561198002521848,Recommended,528720,29286884,Posted: 15 January,all,julesdbd,"This is a polished platformer with plenty of mechanics to play with and a good sense of how to hide secrets in its levels. It's not the longest game in terms of time spent to complete it, but the levels present a good variety of challenges, and make good use of the various mechanics available through the characters you meet up with. The only thing I wish I'd seen would be variations of the character teamups you could have had, but what's here is great already.If you don't like platformers in the first place, I doubt this would change your mind, but for everyone else, it's worth a try!"
,Recommended,528720,29258201,Posted: 14 January,all,Salis,An adorable platformer which nails the crucial easy to learn difficult to master aspect that is so iconic of 2D platformers. Shu has some beautiful music fun powerups and moments of high adrenaline action that makes this a must play for any platformer fan
,Recommended,528720,25922928,"Posted: 8 October, 2016",all,Zelllix,"Shu is an excellent looking game with an unique art style. A lot of original gameplay mechanics will keep on freshening up your experience throughout a big variety of levels with different landscapes/looks.The game runs very smooth and gives the more competitive players a chance to compete on time based highscore leaderboards.I would personally recommend playing Shu with a controller, as the keyboard controls can feel a bit clunky at times."
,Recommended,528720,31148304,Posted: 14 April,all,Jer,"I like this game. A lot. Now that they added free DLC, I had to write a review.I'm a big fan of side-scrolling platformers, and Shu is one of the better recent ones. It can get difficult (the punishing time trials especially), but it's easy enough to finish the story. And it's a breathtaking journey along the way. It’s nice to see a platformer that doesn't go with the ""retro"" pixel graphics style."

Have completed the first world and despite dying a few times it's addictive and cute enough to encourage me to keep trying with regular check points so I don't lose all my progress if I die mid-level (which I hate) unless I lose all my lives. The levels are straight forward and yet challenging with a few nicely hidden gems throughout. I enjoy the different powers Shu can use as you progress. It has great game play, pleasant music and the characters are cute! I've missed playing decent enjoyable platform games with simple yet enticing plot and characters that I actually like and this game ticks all those boxes. This game is right up your street if platforms are your thing and worth a try even if they're not. ^_^"

While the playthrough from start to finish is not overly long, if that's all you want from a platformer this isn't for you.  Shu is full of different ways toi play, alternate routes to find secrets and important to many, leaderboards to rack up the fastest time against the world!I am extremely proud of the game Coatsink has made, I highly recommend this, especially for the low price (Also the sound is awesome so of course I bought the soundtrack)Pros.Beautiful aesthetic, environmental & character.Awesome sound from the soundtrack to the effects (I noticed the windchimes immediately).Very tight controls, I never felt like I wasn't in control of every action.Cute cinematics, no words needed to convery the story of Shu.Interesting mechanic of gaining abilities temporarily based on which villagers you are saving at the time.No enemies, made for a platformer more tuned to just that, not combat.Difficulty curve was there and apparent, this is a platformer for genre lovers.Check point and life system is awesome, reduced much frustation, felt very fair.Plug & play with my PS4 - DS4.Cons.These are fairly nitpickyTooltips for abilities confused me a few too many times, mainly the button press ones perhaps as I didnt look up a control map before I started.The thorned vines in the forest levels seemed to blend a bit too much in the fast pace of running from the storm & a few times some hazard hitboxes felt a little harsh.Cutscene sound blew my ears off after I had turned the game volume down on my Volume Mixer options.Shu is a fantastic little game and well worth the money, a beautiful platformer built for lovers of a the genre, wether you be a collector of everything or a speed freak.Now to go 100% the levels!"

Controls are a bit wonky sometimes, but its minor (played with xbox controller). Was unable to remap glide (I'd rather have it on trigger than bumper). Other than the control issues, its a solid game thats a lot of fun to play."

The controls are a bit floatier than many other platformers, but the levels are designed perfectly around this. I also enjoyed that new abilities are acquired by rescuing the villagers, which means that the abilities are not permanent upgrades, keeping the gameplay varied. If you are not a completionist, the game is on the shorter side, but for achievement hunters, there is plenty here."

This might have been a great game with a bit more beta testing and bug quashing, but as it is, I feel it is not even worth the time you put into it.. There is no real challenge..."

Random leap of faith are required with no real sense of discovery attached to them.Even the level design is dull and works against the game experience.Don't waste your money, there is much much better on steam."
