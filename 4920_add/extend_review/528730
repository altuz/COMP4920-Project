76561197976045979,Not Recommended,528730,29197538,Posted: 11 January,all,Naxx,"Crypt of the Serpent King is a first person dungeon crawler in which you aim to gather keys to unlock a final room (per level) to fight a boss entity. This game is fairly simple, which isn't inherently bad... It should be noted that the developer actively listens to the voice of the community and addresses concerns with frequent updates.I don't recommend purchasing the game for the average consumer; It feels incomplete. The game is playable and I am personally interested to see if new features might be added to spice up the game a bit. At present, the game is just a bit bland. However; I DO recommend that if you have found your way to this page, keep an eye on this game!Some things I liked:> music can create a tone of tension and anxiety> creature models look pretty goodSome things I didn't like so much:> stats don't seem to impact the game all that muchNew weapons seem more important than allocating stat points> lack of depth ( no puzzles or interesting lore objects )Who is the player? Why are they in the crypt? There is no attachment to the game world> Every room looks the same"

,Not Recommended,528730,29441256,Posted: 23 January,all,Athravan,"I noticed this game when the developers released a demo, which I really appreciate - so if you're wondering if you'll like the gameplay, go check out the first 2 levels for free. Just don't expect the rest of the game to offer anything different. I did enjoy the demo; but made the assumption that the full game had more depth.This is not the case.Dungeon Crawling GameplayThe gameplay is fairly standard for this sort of dungeon crawler, it's a real-time action game, so you walk around and you explore, kill creatures and pick up keys in order to level up and progress to the next level. The movement is simple and well executed, and the animations are smooth and swish.Unfortunately the levels are extremely repetitive, to the point where most of them feel the same, and the selection of monsters very poor. There is a mini-boss guardian between each level, but they didn't seem to do anything special.  There are also only 7 levels to the entire game (repeatable on 3 difficulty levels), so it's really rather short. There's not a great deal of loot (only gold and health in game, and a very small selection of weapons you can purchase at each level start, no armor or skills or special abilities), and stats don't seem to make a whole lot of difference (and you can max them out by level 5 on casual). There are also no puzzles, and the mapping is standard and predictable, which unfortunately makes this game lack in much of the intellectual variety.So, you get where I'm going with this, there's just not enough. It's just shallow. Not enough depth, length, variety or gameplay at all. What is there is done well, and I understand it's a £2 game, but it really feels like the entire game is a Unity demo or concept - and it just needs more more more of everything. Since the levels, monsters and environment lack variety, I was thoroughly bored by the end of casual (approximately 90 minutes). I have no doubt that the harder difficulties are much more challenging - but without any additional monsters, loot or mechanics, I just couldn't find any fun in a further grind.Why So Spooky Music ThoughIf there is a mega epic battle around the corner, then the music ramping up in intensity and tone is great. However, the music in this seemed to be slightly confused, as on many occasions it got all excited over absolutely nothing, which really didn't help the tone at all. That wall I just walked into? Yeah, that's not a threat. Sometimes there would be no change in music (there are also no footsteps or noise indicators until you're being stabbed in the back by a goblin), which I suppose added an element of ""jump scare horror"" to the game when I turned around and realized three orcs were all up in my face.ProsSmooth animations and reasonable graphics.Low price.Increasing difficulties for those who enjoy the game and want a challenge.ConsIncredibly simple and shallow gameplay.Boring, due to the lack of mechanics and similar environments.Weird music issues.Very short (90 minutes on the easy difficulty).TL:DR It's a thumbs down from me; even at £2 - but it's not a terrible game, just short and somewhat limited, with a few creases that need to be ironed out. It might appeal to those who love this genre, especially when it goes on sale or gets bundled. Give the demo a try, as this is basically the entire game but rinse and repeat."

It's not like i was expecting a new Skyrim or anything, but i thought it would at least be playable. A mediocre 3D dungeon crawl was what i was hoping for. This doesn't qualify as medeocre. Not even close. The worst part is probably the pathetic bunny-hop jump mechanic that guarantees every time you try to jump over the lava, you'll fall in."

,Recommended,528730,29455229,Posted: 23 January,all,Wildboy Wiley,"Enjoyed the game, though once you learn each enemies attacks, defeating them is not much difficult. The Halberd is weapon of choice till you can afford Sword, then you're on god mode, no need for any other weapons...You would need to play the game three times on all difficulties to unlock all achievements, difficulty achievements do not stack.Bought 3 hours ago, completed 3 times and got all achievements. Definitely worth it for $2.99."

Something is wrong with the jumping  mechanism.2. You can not save the game whenever you want.3. It is very easy to mistake and  lose all your progress in the game because of the bad game interface.Save yourself fraustration. Do not play this game.
,Recommended,528730,29535150,Posted: 27 January,all,SuplexedByLesnar,"While I haven't finished this game yet, I'm rather close and feel comfortable enough to share my views of it. I like it, it's simple, cheap and does exactly what you want it to do. I think a lot of people are upset because there are clearly better Dungeon Crawlers but everyone has to start somewhere.I think my favorite part about this game is that it's just...mind-numbingly fun. I can put on a podcast or listen to music, turn the game on and just go at it without worrying about missing important elements. Plus, if you're creative, you can just sort of make your own story out of what's going on.Overall, if you're looking for simple, cheap and fun, you can't really go wrong here."

It can be fun if you don't go into it expecting something elaborate.  It does have mechanics that you'll need to learn, but only a few.  The final level on hardcore will test whether you've learned those mechanics or not."
76561198272010213,Recommended,528730,29373554,Posted: 20 January,all,HeyeyeyeyA,"I really enjoyed the game for what it is. The combat is repetitive but fun. I had no trouble with the jumping, beat the entire game and didn't fall into a pit of spikes or lava a single time. The music needs to calm down a little, i got scared so many times because the default sound track amped up for no reason. There should be multiple enemy types on one floor for diversity and maybe give some of the enemies ranged attacks. I turned the graphics on ultra and really enjoyed the way the enemies looked. Overall a good game, I'm definitely going back to beat it again on the harder difficulties."

It is simple enough with the basic attack styles that you can breeze through a level once you figure out yours and your enemy's attacks, but if you don't take your time and play cautiously, you can lose very easily. Everything that makes this game fun for me is also what makes me hate this game. Be patient and take your time, and you will like this game."

It took two hours to complete the game 100% on Normal difficulty, so keep that in mind if you have something else to spend 3 bucks on."
,Recommended,528730,29337833,Posted: 18 January,all,GamingwithVon,"Great casual game and challengingPros: was surprised how well some of the animation on the monster were. the game would be kinda 'rogue-like' because you'll die a lot figuring out the combat system while you loose your loot. the challenge of trying not to die was enjoyable again.Cons: the map layouts feel repetitive given that each level are different art. also once you've figured out the timing that you can step to the side to avoid their 1st swing, you can make an easy counter, it's about the timing.Over all, will probably keep playing to beat it then check out the Hard Mode :)(ps - you can run faster if you run diagonal)"
,Recommended,528730,28737667,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,Fagmin,"This is actually super fun, oddly enough though i had a dream a while back where i was playing and or in (cant fully remember) a game like this.The only thing i don't like is the XP Coin counter thing under the mini map. Maybe if there was a small counter for the XP coins ect at the bottom and out of the way it would be better. The clutter to the left really makes it hard for me to focuse on whats going on and throws off my pref vision bad and makes it harder for me to play. Also that double swing animation is kind of annoying, if it was more in tune with Elder Scrolls with free form swings this game would be perfect.Other than that the game was worth the $2 i spent."

Honestly its a great game because of its simplicity but the turning can get annoying. The most challenging part might be trying to jump across the little lava area, seriously I HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE WITH THE STUPID LAVA! 10/10 giant mouse people.Also this game is much scarier then I originally thought it would be."

,Not Recommended,528730,34878907,Posted: 11 September,all,OhioMan,"Played 15 min of this game and I am already furious with this.. Now one issue is if you manage to die falling in lava getting a key its all game over and start from beginning.. now if you quit the game then go play it again you start totally fresh, theres no save, and like most games if you die you usually are spawned where ya died or nearby.. NOPE start ALL over again.. Its a cheap game yes BUT still would be better if things like that were fixed.. maybe give 10 lives and can get more as a drop or in a chest or in a hidden room behind a wall or something... I don't recommend this title other than those irritating issues and will change my review when or IF this game has any positive changes to it but I wouldn't hold my breath as I feel this is shovelware or just slapped together for a quick buck for the developer to buy some fast food or something?"

Timing is critical, and while I already see some reviews knocking the game for being impossible to jump across lava to get the keys or not being able to hit enemies.. it's all timing and skill based movement to succeed.   Every enemy has a different attack style and speed and method and weapon needed to best defeat them.  If you aren't patient enough (or smart enough) to try different strategies or weapons, then this game might not be for you, but don't knock the game because of your lack of patience or logic.It's not a AAA game, but I think it's a very nice game for it's asking price, and it offers plenty of replay value as well with randomized dungeon layouts, multiple weapons to buy, and three levels of difficulty, as well as three attributes which can be increased with experience earned.One note: If you buy this game, PLEASE start on the ""easy"" difficuluty level which will allow you to save your experience and gold progession and advance through the game without getting too frustrated early on.Recommended to people who can appreciate a good old school type RPG game with simplistic controls and a game that will reward you if you go in not expecting a AAA game and if you are logical and patient.86% is my score."

All for $2.99.You go through randomly generated dungeon levels to find all the keys to unlock the door to the dungon boss. The level styles are varied so it doesn't get boring and the levels are huge so your going to be looking at the mini map a lot if you get lost. If you beat the dungeon boss you get to move on to the next level and can upgrade your stats Strength, Agility, and Endurance with the XP you earned from killing enemies, you can also buy new melee and ranged weapons with the gold you found from loot.-It's a hard game that has 3 difficulty modes.-The music fits perfectly with the dungeon style of the game.-The graphics are simple and clean, but modern. It gives the game a nice retro look. The game runs at a solid 60FPS on ultra, and my PC isn't even that good. Really smooth gameplay."
