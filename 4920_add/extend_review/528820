Seriously, do the introduction quests and when Deiter talks about building a wall around the whole kingdom and keeping criminals and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥southerners (Mexicans) and Saracens (Muslims) out, and then meet the corrupt Ice Crone and her corruption and likelihood of war with the ""Muscovites"" (Russia) and support for the Northern Treaty (TPP Deal) as well as her cheating husband and the ""Saracen Beauty"" they even named Huma after her aide Huma Abedin in real-life, you'll know you're choosing Donald or Hillary in this scenario - Which is hilarious. I can't wait to see both sides' endings as neither can be good for the country, just like in real life. Political inside jokes aside, this scenario is actually quite fun."

Taking over enemy castles initially was hard but it was because I tried to capture them all. I changed my strategy and started taking a few and protecting them and it worked much better. Once I captured all, enemies stopped respawning, and I needed to defend my lands only against a few raubritters.Side quests are good, many have a nice touch of humor. I really liked Underwater Bees, I think it's hilarious :) Political references are nicely done as well, not sure what others complain about. You can forget about it after all and treat it lile any other story, stories tend to repeat themselves century after century. Other pluses are:+ Plenty of enemies to max out your army.+ Patrol in your castle - I brought them to max level and they were able to defend my castle twice against rogue knights! It's worth training them often.+ Autumn scenery. I wish original LoE had some of them, looks really nice.+ Interesting quests that make you think and explore the lands.+ Huge map, I think it's the size of the biggest map in LoE.+ Enemies respawn stonger. I captured all castles about a week before November 8 and chased a few bandits. Some of them got so strong I lost a battle. Don't chase bandits with skill ambush in forests, they will destroy you in the first round.There are a few minuses though:- Saves related crashes. After a few ones I read up on forums and found that it's best to use quick save (F5) or rename standard names. For some reason, standard names saves are very likely to cause crashes.- No endless mode. I know it's one map smaller game but I can't help wishing for some random quest generation and armies respawn. I realize it might become boring but it would be so cool to enjoy for a while a victory and rule over my lands with an iron hand :)9 raubritters out of 10"

First part was fun going around and capturing castles, building up your army and doing quests. But then you get to play ring around the map, chasing down bad guys who just appear out of thin air and take your castles.  Why did they mess with the original game concept where it was more of a story and less of a fight fest.   The last 5 hours of game play on this was the developers prolonging the game with 100's of fights over and over against the same castles / resources you took before.  Very disappointed."

But not this one.Humor is not to my taste, and I think idea to mix good medieval setting with modern politics is just bad.And without interesting plot game is just boring for me."

,Recommended,528820,29865159,Posted: 11 February,all,Sgtkilmor,Well made turn based RPG with lots of detail and character development.....I saw others say they had performance issues but ive not experienced any of that. If you like turn based conquest games its the game for you .
,Not Recommended,528820,26589933,"Posted: 13 November, 2016",all,lotice1,"Comparing this to the original game, the obvious political satire here downplays the rich storyline and lore in the previous game. The whole Clinton and Trump thing become so obvious a few minutes into the game and it became somewhat annoying into a short 3 hr gameplay."

Happened to be his birthday, I had no idea.Got my name in the credits with the $8 backing and fulfilled a childhood dream:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=791609955The gameplay is solid, more of the same formula that makes this game great. Story is deep,  with native support for multiple monitors and the game is running smooth at 5040x1050, all settings maxed."

I really liked the original game and played the campaign multiple times. But here, the story line is lacking and the political background used was certainly not a good idea..."

Great reading and a great game to play, although i find this dlc a tad more difficult than the main game, a good challenge. And surely the Northern Treaty is Nato, not TPP.

Watched various Youtube vids about the game, looked decent, started to play it and found it annoying with all the political rubbish. Why listen to rumours in the tavern which have absolutely NO baring on the game whatsoever, just political messages. Wish I read more of the reviews first. Can't believe I paid for this game......MUG."

If I wanted to play U.S. politics I'd watch MSNBC or play a political game. This had loads of potential and I was enjoying it but the dev had to be a jackass and ruin my gaming time with the same crap that's on every liberal media station every minute of the day. Requesting refund. Sadly disappointed as I enjoyed the 1st game and would've continued to support this dev in future games.edit for examples - Ok example, The blond queen loves the foreigners and wants mosques and is potrayed to be for the small people - camel crest, I didn't play long enough to know if she's a corrupt liar that gets beheaded late game or not, her opposition the red headed king, rhino crest wants to build a wall around the kingdom to keep out the southerners who are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and criminals and take all of the work for less. Seriously it doesn't matter who you like in the election, who plays a game like this to have the current political drama played out in a game? There's enough on tv and the internet, games are a nice break from that normally."
