76561198003292839,Recommended,529000,25541249,"Posted: 16 September, 2016",all,FLKttn,"This game is just a huge ball of nostalgia for me.The gameplay is mainly old-school arcade beat'em up - complete with abuseable combostrings, buggy hitboxes and infuriating stunlocks. Please note: that'snota complaint!If you can imagine whatDouble Dragonwould be like if it had been made by Acclaim or MidWay in the 90's you'll knowexactlyhow this feels to play.Thematically, it obviously sits in the ""sexploitation"" genre and plays to the same audience that would appreciate a movie by Troma Entertainment or similar, and is very tongue-in-cheek with it's intentional distastefulness. The boobs on display are played for laughs and for the hokey ""this is so stupid""-factor. I can't imagine many people being sexually aroused byanythingin this game.Blowing up zombies by shooting rockets out of your butt isn't a wet dream for most. It's a joke.Stuff like this was funny in the 70's, 80's and 90's before certain people sought to bring politics into every single thing.This isn't porn. It's not even sexy.The thing about campy stuff like this is that intentionally setting out to create something that is ""so bad it's good"" very rarely works. What most truly campy cult hits have in common is that they are usually the result ofvery, veryhard work - and their failings tendnotto be due to lack of effort or good intentions, but rather little talent or (as in this case) a tight budget.As a one-man effort over several years, the development of this game certainly never lacked effort - and it shows.This first episode only takes about 40 minutes to play through, but many stages contain warp portals that lead to alternate routes for more replayability.You're also given 5 unique characters with varying fighting styles and special moves.One minor complaint on my part though, is how you have to unlock each character in every playthrough.I would have liked to be able to pick any character I had previously unlocked when I started a new game rather than being forced to choose between the two defaults each time.I'm also not a huge fan of the alternative gameplay sections.For some stages you will enter a first-person turret mode which was just plain awful and felt very tacked on.There are also some motorcycle ""ride&gun"" segments that fareslightlybetter, but it's still not good. These sections feel like cheap flash-games that you'd maybe waste a minute with on MiniClip or NewGrounds.I understand wanting to provide some variation but these ""minigames"" broke up the pace in all the wrong ways.That said, the main beat'em up portion of the game is solid and entertaining.It's not a classic and it certainly won't win any ""Game of the Year"" awards, but whenever I get in the mood to kill a few minutes with some old fashion 90's gameplay this provides a perfectly decent alternative to the oldDouble DragonandFinal FightROMs on my emulators.Technical complaints:Now for the ugly bits.Okay, so the game was made with theBeats of Rage / OpenBORengine - which is basically the beat'em up equivalent of whatRPGMakeris to JRPGs orMugento fighting games.The basic gameplay is instantly recognizable once you've tried a couple of games/mods made with it.What puts this game apart from most otherOpenBOR-games is that the content is completely original and the overall quality is (relatively speaking) very high.That's not to say that it's perfect though, asOpenBORitself comes with several hiccups.For starters, I can't get the resolution options to work at all. It's either Fullscreen or ""tiny original resolution window"". Trying to pick anything in between just crashes the game.The options menu is also full of useless settings - most of which you can't even alter, but that are simply there because that's howOpenBORmods work.Gamepad support also doesn't play nice with any of the controllers I tested (XBox360 and XBoxOne - updated with thecorrect drivers).Other, smaller annoyances include stuff like how the high score list applies to all modes -including the training mode, which means you can max your score by just beating up the one immortal ""dummy""-enemy for as long as your patience allows.Again, these aren't critical issues but they do tarnish the presentation."

Some of the menu music tunes sounds like short loops which only is a bother if you are in the menu tho.Also I since I get alot of questions around playing games like this.

,Not Recommended,529000,25660160,"Posted: 23 September, 2016",all,Field Medi-Kun,"TOTALLY REBUILT MY REVIEW (originally it was just praise, but I decided to go in depth on the review)This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awful.But I like it.Getting into the meat of things, Bad♥♥♥♥♥Babes is a pretty standard beat-em' up game wherein you are a FMV babe doing some sweet combos* on; Aliens, Zombies, Strippers, and spooky BDSM people.*(Sweet combos being hitting X a bunch until everything is dead, and wiggling my left stick until a super happened seemingly randomly. In depth look at controlls below.)There are something like 7 stages, 5 Playable characters, 8 enemy sprites, and something like 6 funky tracks.It only took me one hour to play through the game once, and the whole moveset is contained to X, and wiggling left stick with X to do supers. (There are also Rising attacks, and jump attacks)There are some ""Lightgun game"" stages, which are pretty boring, (and I wish I could not play those, because they aren't super enjoyable) And some vehicle levels, which again aren't super enjoyable.I get it, FMV work is super time consuming, and very hard to get everything right, HOWEVER one hour of poor content is just not enough meat to a game to make it worth $10, and cutting out the un-fun segments would shorten the game to maybe 40 minutes.Andrew, PLEASE I implore you to not censor people, and take what they say in stride for your next project, but as it stands now, the way that you handled the criticism for BAB makes me not sure as to if I would even support another game from you.In closing, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. I'm sorry but I just cant. This sort of game is only furthering the reason tripple-A developers don't try to add more adult themes into the gaming industry.EDIT: Upon review, Dev SILENCES anyone that asks a negative question or post criticism of a negative nature, and is terrified of anyone saying the game is less then great. I was all for this game when I bought it and heard about it, but the dev just removing any negative criticism and claiming that its ""trolling"" or ""rude behavior"" is really icky."

I bought it on a lark, partly because of the sexual content, but also from nostalgia, in the hopes that it would be like Pit Fighter.There's no reason to have this game in your library.  It was so bad, that I got a refund.  Pass on it.  You'll thank yourself later."
76561198006276098,Recommended,529000,25806069,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,Samurai Cop,"Certainly one of the more bizarre games you'll run across on Steam. Bad♥♥♥♥♥babes is based on a modified version of the ""Beats of Rage"" engine. Featuring a bit of a mix up of level designs - Between brawling stages like Streets of Rage. Light gun simulation stages a bit like Lethal Enforcers. Along with scrolling motorcycle shootout chase scenes.It's pretty much what you'd expect out of a game that would have felt right at home in the early 90's airing on Cinemax at 1am. Much like one of those skin flicks you'd have to sneak downstairs, in order to stare at the soft fleshy glow emitting from your 200 ton fake wood console tube television. With your parents asleep and the volume muted to watch it. Mainly it relies on novelty with some goofy puns, nudity, some over the top gore, a bizarre alien abduction plot, along with some wacky phallic bosses, backgrounds and special moves.In todays modern society with everything becoming so politically correct; It's a bit nice to see a game sticking up it's middle finger so to speak at the rest of the world. It certainly doesn't commit the sin of trying to take itself to seriously at any time. The game is obviously intended to be pure fun and not much else. A bit of a throw back tribute to the sexploitation genre of the past.Game play wise you're looking at something that is fairly basic by most modern standards. One button for jumping, one for blocking, one for attacking, and a few options for combinations along with a couple special attacks. I find the blocking can be a bit picky at times, but the controls are responsive enough at least without suffering from input lag. The 2D plane allows for mainly basic movement up an down, and forwards an backwards. You're able to roll, jump, and run in order to aid you a bit in dodging enemy attacks.The game also features a leveling system which increases your health/special meter and replenishes it back to full meter as you beat down baddies and collect mysterious green goo for points. Originally the game started you off with 69 now lives. With the update this has been reduced to 3 starting lives and 9 continues to add a bit more challenge. Along with the update adding some new stages, new enemies, and even a few bonus rounds. One of which involves busting up barrels which seems to be a bit of a nod to the old bonus round from Street Fighter II. To bad the dev didn't throw in one where you could bust up a vehicle.You're looking at about an hour or two worth of game play time in total. Starting off you're allowed to choose from a couple of ladies, while unlocking a few more as you battle through the stages. I personally find Asia to probably be the easiest character to use overall. Once beating the game it also unlocks a few extra modes like a survivor mode to offer a bit of additional replability.The pixel animation seems to mainly be designed to mimic the style of older digitized games. Mainly like Mortal Kombat or some of the lesser well known titles like Pit Fighter the arcade game or even Way of the Warrior for the 3DO.One thing I do dislike is if using the keyboard to grab a screenshot with F12 the game will close instantly without a prompt if your finger slips to F9. The developer seems quite dedicated to his game at least. So I would imagine most issues will be ironed out sooner or later. He already recently added a new update which has improved the game overall and fixed some of the original bugs.Is it worth 10 bucks? Well... It is a bit hard to justify the price unless you're really a serious fan of things like b-movies, old school beat 'em up games, and of course 90's style arcade action games. I feel like I got my money's worth at least. Bad♥♥♥♥♥babes is something of strange niche that you might want to play once or twice, or play with a friend for a few laughs. Other than that, I can't see it being much more than just a conversation piece once you've kind of taken everything in from playing through. It's kind of a game that you either ""get"" or you don't.That being said I'd still give it a recommendation based solely on the weirdness factor alone. Overall I found it pretty entertaining. It's also just kind of cool to see someone attemping to create these types of games again in the modern era. If it appeals to your sense of humor you'll probably enjoy it. Pick it up some afternoon when the wife an kids are out shopping an then hide it under your mattress before they come home!"

Mechanically speaking, there are no surprises here. You advance from screen to screen using combos, jump attacks, and special moves to beat your enemies senseless, racking up a score as you work your way to the end of each level to fight the boss. As you progress, you unlock new characters to play in the following levels, keeping the experience fresh with new attack animations to use against new enemy types, as the opposition grows tougher and more numerous. The beat'em up levels are interspersed with some mini-game levels involving guns and car chases, which also get progressively harder. Additionally, there are portals you can occasionally use to take a different route to the end of a level.The game comes with the normal mode where you control one girl on screen and the difficulty corresponds to that. There's also the more entertaining Xtreme mode where the AI controls the other girls simultaneously as you all beat things up together, although the opposition is a lot stiffer to compensate. There's a training mode, a survival mode, and separate modes for the shooting and car chase mini-games if you particularly enjoy those.Call me shallow, but simple games like this combining good music and classic gameplay in one daringly sexy retro package are one of life's small pleasures, and this one is well worth the low price of admission."

Not nearly long enough for the price tag, even considering that the game is meant to be replayed.I understand the artistic style and vibe the developer was going for. I enjoyed the vibe and intention, but there's features one would expect to be there that are straight up missing. This is why the review is negative. The game shows the skeleton of an excellent title, but needs some meat on the bones.There's no credits, so I can't even find out what other work your lovely models have done. I was trying to find out if Inferno has done other work, but that's completely impossible even after looking at your website and facebook pages. You may have built a decent video game, but the main draw is still the models. There isn't even a gallery for unlocked art work, which would add replayability and a reason for me to want to get a higher score. I could code a gallery like that in an afternoon, and I haven't touched my copy of Notepad++ in ten years. It's just a simple thing to do that fans will truly appreciate. Think back to Mortal Kombat. As long as the title has been on consoles, there's been an unlockable gallery to peruse.There's no movelist for each character, even in training. I understand the controls are generic smash em up, but it would be nice to know what I'm attempting before I attempt it. It doesn't need to be fancy, I just want a single move list, a combo list, and a special list."

The controls aren't the best but once you rebind some keys on the keyboard it gets better. You do have to power up your moves - all of which are executed the same on every girl although they have different effects, I like that so you don't have to dedicate your life to learning new moves like it's Mortal Kombat.The sound popped quite a bit for me in a bad way like someone tapping a mic I'm not sure why. The game is very short but you can unlock a new girl maybe other♥♥♥♥♥♥from doing it (I only played all the the way through once so far and some survival modes).Overall it's rough around the edges but fun to play.

Brought me back to the 90's with it's side scrolling beat 'em up game play and the digitized characters was a nice touch.  I feel the game is best when played in co-op.  The adult humor and sexuality is funny and risque.  The on rails FPS levels were a bit unnecessary but overall a fun experience. I hope to see more updates for this game and I'd love to see the developer add cheats.  I recommend this game mostly for people that grew up in the 90's playing side scrolling beat 'em ups.

Howver the messed up, ghosting controls and imprecise collision detection prevent any real fun. Triggering combos is often sheer luck because of unrecognized button down/up events. On top of this are coming grafical glitches which show highlighted boundingboxes around sprites and a gamepad support that is just mapping gamepad buttons to keyboard keys, thus rendering the thumb and index buttons of the xbox-360 controller unusable.Bummer."

It was further explained that this game thinks my keyboard, mouse, remote control, phone etc etc are all joysticks.It was suggested that I sit down and start uninstalling drivers and unplugging peripherals to try to figure out something about a virtual joystick..... I guess because i have nothing better to do with the limited time I have to play games than spend a frustrating hour plugging and unplugging peripherals and installing and uninstalling drivers and rebooting and all that garbage, but i am not going to do that.This game cost 10 bucks and I got a total of 48 minutes playtime before it was updated to no longer function.I hate getting ripped, but I hate it more at Christmastime.I have had it for too long to get a refund at this point.------------Original review - This is a terrible game, and if not for the eye candy, I would say it was the worst game I've ever played on steam....The eye candy is there tho, and it's cute and all.........But, make no mistake, the gameplay, mechanics, story and music are awful!Fist of Jesus plays better than this....and that game sucks! lol"

I wasn't expecting Shakespeare, but I WAS expecting quality that was at least on par with Streets of Fury.  Sadly, it missed the mark in almost every way.The programming is extremely amateurish, as though it was something that was made for a web browser on New Grounds.  (Except I've seen better products come out of New Grounds.)  Additionally, the writing could have easily been done by a twelve-year-old.  Again, not that I was expecting the writing to be epic or anything, but instead of being funny it just made my eyes roll the entire time.  I like a good♥♥♥♥♥♥joke as much as the next person, but these were just painful.This is only the second game I have ever requested a refund for - which is saying a lot, considering I have nearly 500 titles on Steam alone.

The combat is fairly fluid, I intitially had some issues both setting up controller support, and then executing the special moves with my steam controller, but once I got everything working and got a hang of the controller inputs, it was a lot of fun, and a great nostalgic trip.Also, GoGo is best girl.5/7 perfect score.Seriously though, this game is way more fun than it deserves to be.

By “nude” I mean “body positive”...In what would otherwise be the perfect world where all men have been killed or imprisoned, some alien invaders have to ruin the utopia and use the Earth's women as sex slaves. Though honestly not that different from the current patriarchal♥♥♥♥♥♥culture we live in, unlike the male monsters that just infect women with gross babies, alien sex (I mean♥♥♥♥♥♥ mutates the otherwise ordinarily awesome females into superpowered goddesses... The Bad♥♥♥♥♥Babes!Calling back to the Sega CD era of digitized beat-'em-ups and light gun games, Bad♥♥♥♥♥Babes is like that game you'd hear rumors of your friend's uncle having that didn't really exist. Now it does. The majority of the gameplay is side scrolling fisticuffs reminiscent of Streets of Rage or Double Dragon, just with more boobs. The controls can feel a little stiff, but they're serviceable and offer more depth than necessary. Each babe has unique special attacks like splits and running kicks, as well as super attacks that require use of a meter which can be refilled by collecting alien goo. The supers are dazzling: ping pong balls are involved, nukes are ejected from asses, giant snakes are summoned through the power of rock.As you fight through the imaginative levels and collect points by being a Bad♥♥♥♥♥Babe your character levels up and gains a larger health bar and special meter, and can spend currency between levels on consumable items. The helpful, naked shopkeeper offers you a choice of blowup dolls, tasers, a basket of throwable ♥♥♥♥♥♥, or an overpowered mech/spaceship to murder everyone who dares to pay you less money than they would a man. Or you could just buy some extra lives, which you may need because the game can feel cheap at times.The standard melee action is broken up by first person, on-rails shooting galleries and motorcycle levels. While these diversions are authentic to the retro style the game is going for, they're forgettable. Moving a crosshair around the screen to shoot rubber masked aliens is amusing for a bit, but whenever the Bad♥♥♥♥♥Babes aren't visible you have to ask yourself, “Where are the Bad♥♥♥♥♥Babes?”.Higher difficulty levels and additional modes unlock after completing the main game, including a remixed campaign where enemies are shuffled and you're joined by AI-controlled allies. When all the Babes are on screen at once, shooting breast dragons, laying down bra spikes, and whipping their bikini tops around, turning enemies into bloody giblets... it's a chaotic sight to behold.With a gripping, emotional, relevant story and a strong cast of characters, Bad♥♥♥♥♥Babes is the voice of a generation. A true triumph of intersectionality and diversity, only the stiff controls and questionable difficulty lead to cognitive dissonance and hold it back from being a masterpiece. When a goddess disrobes and asks you to enter the interdimensional portal in her ♥♥♥♥♥♥, take the leap."

There is only one attack button, not one fasst and one strong, as is the norm but one attack only. Many enemies attack with projectiles that are unblockable. The block isn't much use in this game at all sadly. The move list is not accessible through the pause menu.  But it's a fun idea and worth getting for the ""i wonder what games they would make if the 90s was forever""aspect. Hopefully devs will keeep polishing and *ehem*add some curvier women. Samantha 38g would be cool. Just saying. And lose the enemies with lasers. Please."

After talking to very communicative and caring developer Andrew, realized simply uninstalling and then leaving the game in default settings (windowed) works fine. You then get a hilarious, schlocky side scrolling beat em up that features scantily clad young women who occasionally are not clothed at all. This isn't a glamor feature, so don't expect ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s-style content, it's all very low-fi - motion captured but not smooth (on purpose). Think Lethal Enforcers and a few more of those early 90's games, including even Mortal Kombat. In any case, kudos to Andrew for having arrow keys for movement by default (guessing Andrew's a leftie like me).Also, in the short time I played so far gameplay changes to side scrolling FPS a la Operation Wolf, complete with that one guy who keeps popping up real close to you, you know back in the 80's that was to show off the big sprites. Here it's just for fun. The whole game is for fun, and has some really awesome writing with totally no punctuation at all to explain its plot about evil aliens and zombies that want to enslaves and abuse humanity oh and there's a girl that uses her portal as a literall portal to alternate paths like boss fights.Otherwise, too bad there aren't more checkpoints/savepoints but that's OK. To be honest I won't likely put a lot of time into this but it's really fun and funny once you get to know it.Serves me right for thinking with the wrong glands...game won't even run on my setup, crashes when I try to change from full to windowed. No patience for tinkering with config files, I understand this is an intentionally hokey production made with Windows 95-level user friendliness, but still...waste of money.1/10"

It's what you'd expect from a 90's Beat'em up mashup mix with digitized real people thrown in. Kudos to the beautiful girls and developers for all their hardwork! I give it two thumbs up!

76561198063950755,Recommended,529000,25576125,"Posted: 18 September, 2016",all,schizkid,"First of all, let it be known that I'm a HUGE fan of the beat em' up genre.Is the game the next ""Streets of Rage"", ""Final Fight"" or even ""Double Dragon""?No!But is it fun?  You bet your sweet a$$ it is!!!This game uses the Beats of Rage (BOR) engine.  There are tons of mods out there for it, but typically use sprites, backgrounds, etc ripped from other games.  From what I can tell, this uses all original content.GAMEPLAY:  If you've played BOR or any of its many mods, you know what to expect in terms of gameplay.  There's a solid roster of moves.  Your basic attack string, jump attacks, dash attacks and a couple of really interesting special attacks from each character.  There is a little mixture in the gameplay by introducing some arcade-style shooting and vehicular combat, which I didn't expect, but is a nice addition.  There is also a nice leveling up system.  I'm not sure how it works, but the characters level up from time to time.  You start with 2 characters to play with, but more become available as you play the game.MUSIC:  Suprisingly above par!  There's a nice mix of club/techno and even metal tracks.  They might not make it on your playlists, but are enjoyable and fitting to the action.  Definately well above average!GRAPHICS:  It starts in a windowed mode.  You can switch it to fullscreen in the options.  I play on a '45 Samsung LCD display and everything is pleasing enough.OVERALL:  This is definately a game meant for the adult fans of the beat'em up genre.  There is quite the score of gratuitous nudity and special moves that involve projecting objects from the various parts of the female anatomy.  The game has a good mixture of fun, action, humor, music and sex appeal.  I have to give kudos to the developers for thinking ""outside the box"" (or in the box) for some original ideas and play.  You can quite see alot of attention, love and bodily fluids went into its production. On the ""indie scale"", I'd give it a solid 3.5 / 5.CRITIQE:  Many of the characters could stand for a few more frames of animation, to smooth things out.  I do know the BOR engine has its limitations!FINAL THOUGHTS:  I'm fine with the current $10 USD price point and recommend this to hard-core beat'em up fans.  The rest may want to wait for a sale.  Being, essentially a BOR mod, its an awesome piece of work!!!  I hope to see more from this developement team!"

,Recommended,529000,25539047,"Posted: 16 September, 2016",all,CooperTeam,"As anyone who is familiar knows, this was made with ""Beats Of Rage"" (I stand corrected, the dev has informed me that it's now called OpenBOR or Open Beats Of Rage, my apologies...) or SORR program. There are plenty of other games like this, although none are like this game.Bad @$$ Babes is a Final Fight/Streets Of Rage clone that pleys pretty well. It uses live actors and digitized sounds and music to make a complete package of this game. It's basically a cross between Streets Of Rage + Pit-Fighter, and then adds a few sexy babes here and there, added with a nice slew of bad guys to really up the game.When I first saw this, I was impressed with it because there's not many games that use live actors, rather they use anime-style/cartoon-style to make the characters, enemies, bosses, and backgrounds. Not many games are made like this.When I first played this game (Put in 22 minutes when making this review), I wasn't sure what to really expect, but once I got into it, I was really impressed. Gameplay was very smooth and no video glitches that I could see. There are a lot of things going on in this game and it really helps catch the eye with it's artwork and digitized animations.Gameplay is pretty solid for the most part. (Since I have not beaten the game yet, I have yet to see what is next) There are options to change the settings around and there is gamepad support. (I didn't use the gamepad so I don't know if this works good here, as the keyboard worked fine for me) During the game, there are 2 modes that change with each level. Part action, part shooter. The action part is pretty much like you would find in Final Fight/Streets Of Rage, while the shooter part is a lot like a zapper game, where you use the controller to aim your gun sites and the attack button to shoot. My biggest love for this game was the special abilities that came with each character. Love how you can play as 1 character and kill a row of monsters with your bra, while another character strips naked and attacks with butt bombs.Sound and music was pretty good and a nice mix that added some good flavor to the game. Music ranges from rock to some techno beats. Sounds worked pretty good. Punch sounds and pain sounds seem to work for this game.I also like that the dev has been updating as needed and adding new content as it becomes available. The updates have been worth the wait and love the new characters added to the games.Overall, I am having a lot of fun with this game and I hope the dev helps the game get updated as needed. So far no problems on my end, but never know. Do understand that this isn't a really serious game as it's for about humor and fun. Even the dev admits to it's craziness and humor. Only buy if you just want some humor, fun, and sure, sexy BAD @$$ BABES!!! ^_^"

I only played a small portion of the game but I laughed pretty hard. Lots of toilet humor and it's very fun to play. At first the game seems too simple but in just a few minutes of playing you'll see there are some complex things you can do.

Couldn't say I didn't enjoy playing it, but it really should be listed as ""early access"" so that we can tell ourselves that more levels will be released in future to justify the price. Many levels and bosses were made too difficult for serious play (especially the car chase scenes), if not for the ""no life count"" I will probably never get pass 20 minutes of play. I guess it's a nice party game with your bros for laughs on pizza night. But for single player wise, at current state there's not enough value to justify the $9.99 tag. Personally, I do look forward to this game's development and wish to see it evolve over time.

76561198147291752,Recommended,529000,25555053,"Posted: 17 September, 2016",all,Ophelium,"Way back in the age of Pit Fighter and its ilk, this is the game my teenage hormones wanted to see. It's entertaining, bawdy and...incomplete.I have to credit the dev for putting in the time and effort for BAB, it truly feels like a work of love rather than a ""here's some boobs, pay me money"" attempt. I know that the game is not done, given there will be Episode 2, but I've always hated endings like that since Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver.The fighting is competent with plenty of special moves and several modes. I'm presently working through Xtreme mode which lets you fight alongside a AI controlled partner with tougher mooks. The stages are pretty neat and there are little details which just make them pop, punctuated by cheestasticly awesome dialogue. There's pretty good enemy variety and environmental dangers. Weapons are great, but infrequent and there's too little variety. I did enjoy the FPS parts, but I didn't care for the vehicle sections which just frustrated me after the first one. To be fair, vehicle levels in a side-scrolling beat-em up rarely fare well.Going forward, I'd like to see in-game collectables to unlock some of the enemies as playable fighters (especially the one with the sword and shield) and maybe get rid of starting with 69 lives. I get it's probably a joke, but it isn't a good one.I recommend Bad♥♥♥♥♥Babes, if it's been that weird dream of yours like it has been for me and you'd like to support a cool dev. Just be forewarned that a playthrough doesn't take that long.Edit: Since I progressed a bit more in Xtreme mode, I just wanted to add that in Xtreme mode, you fight alongside all the other characters you have unlocked, which makes for some hectic but fun action."
