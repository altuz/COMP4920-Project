Weird, yes like all dreams are. Not for everyone, but more than 50% of the levels are not too bad especially the ""self improvement"" i think is the name where you wakeup in the creator's bed room. just relatable. yet it cant be relatable for everyone. plus its freee. there are worse games charging money here."
,Recommended,529110,29452055,Posted: 23 January,all,The Laissez Pharaoh,"This is NOT A HORROR GAME! I wanted to put that sentence at the very top, not as a criticism, but just for anyone who might have been scrolling past this after having seen the bizarre ""horror"" tag attached to this game. That tag nearly put me off from playing to begin with, because I'm just not a horror fan. But I'm glad I did play, because only the second level is even remotely horror-related, and the rest of it is much more my kind of thing. Anyway, on with the review:So first thing's first, when playing this you will find yourself very tempted to compare it to Davey Wreden's The Beginner's Guide. The overall ""feel"" of the game, as well as several of the individual levels, are reminiscent of The Beginner's Guide, and the developer's commentary name-checks Wreden twice. The game even borrows one piece from The Beginner's Guide's beautiful OST (the housecleaning song from TBG can be heard during the ladder-climbing sequence in this game.) There's even a ""Beginner's Guide to..."" book that can be seen on a shelf in the game.However, despite the fact that this game practically begs to be compared to TBG, I reccommend you restrain yourself from doing so. While there are certain similarities, the two games are fundamentally different in what they're trying to do. TBG is a heavily narrative-driven game with a relatively more limited degree of abstractness, whose clearly defined surface-level story conceals deep layers of hidden meaning and symbolism. This game is pretty much the exact opposite of everything in that sentence. Not because it's an attempt to replicate TBG that failed, but because it's trying to do something else entirely. So let's judge it on its own terms.If you fail to do so, you'll search for hidden meaning in every piece of abstract symbolism, and when you find none you'll be disappointed. You'll assume it's secretly trying to say much more than it's letting on, and you'll feel confused and underwhelmed when you can't find the deeper meaning. You'll expect it to build and crescendo into an emotionally devastating revalation at the end, and you'll be surprised when it actually ends in decidedly anti-climactic fashion. In other words, you'll judge this game far more harshly than you otherwise would if you simply accepted it for what it really is, and proceed from there.Having played through the game twice and read the developer commentary, I am now reasonably confident that it actually is just a series of little mini-levels, strung together in no particular order, mostly inspired by dreams. The only thing that really consistently ties them together is the presence of a door in almost every level, and a more or less explicit autobiographical aspect to many of the levels.However, this is essentially just a series of interesting little ideas, presented to you by a very young developer, and most of them are at least fairly enjoyable to look at or to think about. I particularly liked the fact that there was an unaknowledged hidden level, which (for me at least) could only be accessed by the level select screen, rather than being integrated into the flow of  the main experience.One legit weakness this game does have - aside from just ""Boo hoo, it's not as good as The Beginner's Guide!"" - is that the three levels which were, in my opinion at least, head and shoulders above the rest, and without which this review would probably be more of a ""meh"" than a ""recommended"" - namely the countdown/ladder level, the sabotage level, and the ""Time to get over her"" level - were also the three levels which seemed... err... ""most heavily dependent on external inspiration"" would be a kind way to say it. They're still great levels, with brilliant ambience and competent execution, but I was a little sad that the game's three peaks were also the three bits which most closely resembled ideas and symbols from Davey Wreden's games. However, perhaps that's just a comment on my own personal prefrences, and other people found the more original and inventive levels to be the highlights.However, all in all I would recommend this game for an enjoyable, reasonably well made, fairly interesting, and somewhat emotionally impactful 1hr abstract walking simulator. It competently hits the target it's aiming at, and that makes it a good game, regardless of whether you think it's not the most interesting target it could have picked to begin with. I mainly enjoyed it because you can definitely see the seed of something interesting in there, and I can't wait to see how that seed grows and evolves in this developer's future works.Also dank memes, so 13/10!"
,Recommended,529110,29493451,Posted: 25 January,all,SHOƎ,"Something about this game struck a chord with me. Perhaps it was the art style, music, sound, imagery, or perhaps just the overall feel. It made me familiar with the outright confusing.I had originally thought this game would be just another ""Unity Game."" Slow paced, clunky, and poorly designed.For the most part, I was very wrong.Awkward Dimensions may not be for most, as it can be awkward and confusing at times. Perhaps even a bit too personal. But that's pretty much the point of the game, and it's executed quite well.For me at least, everything fit together well. It was a refreshing break from the fast-paced, straightforward, tried and true methods of other genres. Awkward Dimensions comes off as a bit heavy handed, yet keeps a general rythm/atmosphere throughout.Overall, an odd and wonderful mix of both sensation, and storytelling.I'd highly recommend giving it a go. Take a break from your own head for a while, and enter the unfamiliar world of someone else's."
,Recommended,529110,30231916,Posted: 27 February,all,LO FI,"One of the most mesmerizing games out there.I found this game randomly in the Free to Play section. Once I loaded it up, I didn't think it would be that good (hence the Unity Personal Edition logo) but then, once I played it, I felt like I was in an entirely different world. The last level,  Find The Way Out, really spoke to me. When I was younger I was trying to find the way out. There was a time where I was basically trapped.It might eat up disk space, but it's amazing."

This is the game for you.The positive I found was the music. really beautiful and well done, adding a different feel to each level and how you experienced it. Some levels were colorful and interesting, although there is nothing interactive to keep you interested past what you initially see. Fleshed out, there could be more to it.Other than that, the movement is clumsy and doesn't feel normal, playing with a gamepad means you hold the left joystick down while moving, which sucks, and it's hard to tell where you'll land every time you jump, as the creator requires jumping to complete different portions. The bad game design overcomes the positives here.I'm glad it ended when it did, because my patience was also at its end."
