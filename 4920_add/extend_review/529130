The combat is solid for a game of this type. I really enjoyed exploring and seeing different events, much in the way you come across interesting events when doing escort missions in Fallout 1. I'm an FTL junkie and this game satisfied that urge as well.Edit: Issue resolved, thank you!I'm now over the 40 hour mark and playing the last class, the wizard, and having a lot of fun with it. The classes are different enough that it's interesting to play through again and see the new abilities.I can't wait to see what happens next after youkeep the runes!I really enjoyed this game overall and love that it seems to be updated pretty often."

I was impressed by my first playthrough and I am very excited to begin anew. The game is definitely in need of work, but I am thouroughly happy with it."

It is definitely a rogue game. as you can die at any time.  I like the art and the gameplay, and with time, I think it will be a well polished game.  The developers seem involved in releasing new patches to address problems.If you like short bursts of gameplay in a rogue style, you'll like this one.  Don't expect the depth of an RPG done by a major developer.  Expect the Unexpected."
,Recommended,529130,29310335,Posted: 16 January,all,AtmaVegeta,"I'm enjoying this game.  It's a good mix of strategy, rpg and rogue-like.  The puzzle thing to rez is pretty neat and different.  Also, I like the setting of different factions and rep you can gain depending on your choices.I'm playing on normal and it's not too hard so far (I have 6 runes I believe, died once because dropped weapons and altar and lost them, didn't have a spar lol). I haven't tried the archer or wizard class yet (just unlocked archer).The only downside so far is random spelling mistakes but they aren't a big dealbreaker for me.  I can understand the message being delieved."
,Recommended,529130,28317535,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,KaiseN,"It's a one of a kind game. I was looking for this type of game for a long time. Reading all the comments I thought the game was unfinished or something. The gameplay can be improved yes, but has great potencial to be perfected. This game is definitely not for noobs but if you are a roguelike/turnbased rookie you can start playing in easy mode. The story and events make the experience very addictive for roguelike lovers. Go ahead and support this amazing indie game you won't regret it! 5 stars"
,Recommended,529130,28302145,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,DeadlySight,"So this game falls entirely inline with the genre I love. It's difficult at the start, once you get some levels the game definitely gets easier but you can still definitely mess up and die. Overall I like the general direction of the game, the death system is an awesome way to keep going after a mistake (as long as you can do some quick mental math ;) ).The game doesn't appear to have much replay value IMO and the ending was LOLWTFBAD, but overall I don't feel ripped off. Fun little 10-12 hour game."

(Even though I died 5 times on easy difficulty)"
76561198061522023,Recommended,529130,33718351,Posted: 22 July,all,ruanswart,"This game is very similar to FTL in that you move around on the map and get different encounters. The battle system however is turn-based, and this is also fantasy as opposed to sci-fi.Pros:- several different unique and in-depth classes- interesting battles and scenarios- good inventory and reputation system- requires strategy and planning (in a good way)Cons:- battles can get repetitive- early game is extremely hard, especially one unavoidable encounter- graphics aren't exactly amazing- unlike FTL, map is the same every time"

,Recommended,529130,28924044,Posted: 1 January,all,RedWormCharlie,I like it. Kind of like FTL in the middle ages.
,Recommended,529130,35038770,Posted: 17 September,all,Biterkid,"I love this game, it uses a similar formula to FTL regarding the world map, random events and resource management, but the combat and exploration follows the Rogue style.It also features an alignment system that helps spicing up the choices."
76561198037623813,Recommended,529130,28289543,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,jeb.hack,Started with a bad review citing lots of bugs in this gaamae.  Game has been patched and bugs are fixed.  Recommend game!!
,Recommended,529130,32490703,Posted: 16 June,all,d4rk_heart,Simple and fun! Never experienced such unexpected things. Its a bit hard at the beggining but as long you keep searching for apples and using the right combos becomes easier.
76561198042589505,Recommended,529130,30090173,Posted: 21 February,all,samuricex,Thought I'd give it a 2 hour trial and get my refund.  WRONG!  Liked the game enough that I kept it.  Definitely a game you can keep coming back to and play in spurts.
,Recommended,529130,30292740,Posted: 3 March,all,black is back,The game was fun for the first hour then it get gringing and boring really fast. it would be nice if the dev add more events and make the game more complex then just click and hit.In conclusion I recommend this game for kids under 8.As a 19 years old man I will give this game a 5.1/10.

76561197979402731,Not Recommended,529130,28290879,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,Zatio,"This game need a lot of work, but it is a promising game, at the momment the best any one can do is try to head into town without dying a horrible death on your very first step.The death mini game is pretty pointless as i see no way to even guess the right answer to the riddle in time.Many events await you, and most of them will be negative ones but the combat is nice, and it does seem like they plan to make the game more balanced.The story is pretty weak from what i saw as i spawned, you are just thrown into it, go and get the 12 runes blablabla and that is all the information you get as you set out to find the runes.The skills in this game is also nothing special, only a couple of them seems to be good to have.I would not recommend this game but once they have patched the game with their balance fixes it will atleast become more playable for those interested in playing."
76561198009564404,Not Recommended,529130,28277601,"Posted: 9 December, 2016",all,TJ McGurn,Not worth $10. This could be an online Flash game for its quality and depth.Combat is simplistic yet slow and traveling is more tedious than exciting.
,Not Recommended,529130,28296854,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,Another Persona,"I was so surprised. This would be a poor investment for an Early Access game. No tutorial, which is fine if there were at least tool tips. Gameplay is bland, unbalanced, and poorly explained (How in the world does one charge?). Poor dialogue, lots of errors, etc. The issues compound, wait for .99 sale in a few years."

I am really enjoying the game, I recommend it."

Combat is meh, AI (when you get a hired hand) is bad.  I thought it had some potential but in the end it was 2 hours of my life I couldn't get back."
76561198022907259,Not Recommended,529130,35171623,Posted: 23 September,all,Hudson,"This is almost good, but I feel the rebirth / new life mechanic is missing.  Your character really can die at any time, and if you've invested any amount of time into him, it really is a letdown to have to start over again with nothing gained.  A lot of roguelikes have new skills learned or powers unlocked after a nice playthrough so that you can feel some kind of reward for your wonderful effort on your now dead character.  This game needs something like that to enhance replay value.  I know you can unlock one new class for each playthrough if you had gotten far enough in the game, but it doesn't make death very satisfying."

On top of that, I can't believe no reviewer mentioned this. This is not at the level of ""oh, the story's boring and childish"", it's at the level of ""I think a foreigner wrote the (terrible) storyline and translated it into English via Google or Babblefish"".Here is the FIRST text box of the entire game, I will let you judge the writing and grammar (this is verbatim, all grammar mistakes are the game developer's own):""You were just a farmer, doing the ordinary daily routine when suddenly were contacted by the Gods. The 12 runes of power were stolen and lost throughout Lorhaven. The Gods are on brink of war and They crave influence over the mortals. They chose you! A humble farmer with the a heart of gold, a courage of a lion and a pure moral conduct.You are about to embark on an adventure of a lifetime, it was given to you a difficult task to collect the 12 runes, in hopes of restoring faith and order again! A mere mortal touched by the Gods.""TLDR: this RPG's writing and grammar is at the 2nd grade level. I requested a full refund of the game within 10 minutes of playing. Don't waste time with this trash, not even worth $1 (I paid $10 for this)."
