It's a perfect Ender's Game-esque experience for the steep price of whatever your horrid internet provider charges for a meagre amount of data.I'm not sure why I can't stop playing this or stop cursing at the AI when it's just a simple VR tactics game, but now my arms ache and the headset is slowly melding into my pores.Send help.Preferably in the form of a larger spaceship with more lazers."

The game is an excellent demonstration of the timelessness of simple strategy games like chess and, to a lesser extent, checkers: very easy to pick up, but endlessly different possibilities that keep you coming back for more.Highly recommended for at least a quick try as this is an independently developed game offered for free. While adding extra features might betray the minimalist approach, it could be worth a shot to add an extra twist to the experience. If multiplayer is released, this will undoubtedly be a must-have for quick 10 minute strategy battles on the Vive."

This is hands down the most playable VR game I've found.  The gameplay is great, the controls make sense, the strategy is engaging.NOW I WANT online multiplayer.   ALSO, I really want to be able to be able to rotate the view when I pinch the controlers to resize.  Instead of just resizing, let me rotate the entire battlefield around/upside down so that it feels more 3D."

Select planets, choose % of ships and move them to other planets to conquer a huge solar system.CONS: After playing few games, this can be repetitive. Maybe adding more complexity like multiple type of ships, planets with moons, types of planets (earth like, gaz, etc.) could improve this game and add other challenges."

It was one of the first games I installed when I got my Vive a month ago but it sat I played because I assumed because of its simplicity I would just dismiss it in 5 minutes...how wrong I was. Massively entertaining, a brilliant idea and perfectly executed. I can't wait to play more... oh, and IT'S FREE!"

,Recommended,529150,29401482,Posted: 21 January,all,info_player_smart,"Lazerbait, a pretty well made RTS that requires planning and quick responding.Pros:- Free (no harm done in trying, right?)- Unique-ish gameplay. It's territory control- Not too performance demanding (it runs on the Unity engine)- Controller skin support (not that important, but why not)- Easy to learn- Supports Oculus Touch and HTC Vive- Can be played room-scale and standing/seatedCons:- No multiplayer support- Games can become very difficult if you have more than 3 of AI players- (Nitpicking) Ship models are a bit too generic (but minimalist, which is okay)- (Nitpicking) Planets all have the same textureOverall, I found this game to be very fun, and I would definitely recommened it to any HTC Vive or Oculus Touch owner."
,Recommended,529150,29970346,Posted: 16 February,all,Abrondino,This is just what I needed. A basic strategy game where party goers could play without much explanation.

76561197964557046,Recommended,529150,29431659,Posted: 22 January,all,Kayotee,"This is the first game for the Vive that I feel like I CAN'T get tired of!  Lazerbait is a great example a game that's immensely fun to play despite the fact that it uses simple graphics and simple game play.  The first game I played on easy difficulty and small map, I thought ""eh, not much to this game at all, I'll get bored fast"".  After working my way up to 7 AI opponents on a large map with higher AI difficulties, the game became a riot.  The fact that this game works fine as a ""sitting"" game, is all the better also.  Highly recommended for anybody looking for a light to medium, fast paced strategy game."

Simple yet very entertaining: easy controls, easy to understand how the game is played and quite intriguing. Best of all: it's free! Must have for VR enthousiasts, especially if you like space/strategy games!"
76561197997881798,Recommended,529150,29456096,Posted: 23 January,all,Revlis,"This is a great little game that really showcases how VR RTS space conquest games might function.  It's simplistic - everyone is the same ""race"" and there is only one type of ship.  The only variety is it seems like some planets can jump to others but not vice versa, but this may be a bug mascarading as a feature, I dunno.  With some fleshing out this could go from an awsome tech demo game (that has pleanty of replayability!) to a genre defining game.  I really hope the dev puts out a good expansion pack for a few bucks, I would be more than happy to send some $$$ his way for his efforts."

,Recommended,529150,29954909,Posted: 15 February,all,stankiem,"One of the best games at any price for VR, if you don't have it yet, what are you waiting for?  If you like strategy games, this is pretty much risk, it's brilliant!  Would have paid $15 for this if I had known how much fun it is, great job dev!  Make a bigger, more complex multiplayer version, or maybe a more grand straegy-esque version and I would pay a good deal for it!"
