So no “restarts” to gain more power over time.You have a lot of different creatures, to level up, skill and equip them with gear you can get from chests you find.What’s really awesome about the game is, that the Developer updates it constantly, sometimes there came a new patch with new features every day. Also he is reading the community feedback on the forums and reacting to it.If you want to try a new idle game, I can absolutely recommend trying Creature Clicker - Capture, Train, Ascend! out!"

What it does have is the blood and sweat of a guy who obviously enjoyed creating something as a hobby. Sure, there are free clicker games that have more content to them but this has heart. (and no ads or micro-transactions)Give the guy the £1 ish for just going out of his way to create something for people, think of it as rewarding creativity in a tiny tiny way."

As much as I enjoyed the launch gameplay, I'm very anxious to see how far it'll go. I think that's the sign of a good early access game.For now,Creature Clickeris AWESOME for achievement hunters. There are hundreds of achievements and half will unlock in the first 15 minutes. And if you're willing to wipe and start over with a new egg, it's possible to get all the achievements in a day or so.I'm grateful to ColloseusX for their timely responses to my questions and their timely fixes for launch bugs. I forsee good things!"

Nothing explain, click buttons and assume/figure stuff out. I love achievemtns but come on that is a little ridiculous. Money is horribly scaled and the farm is a joke with a pricing, your gonna need either 2 mice or a autoclicker for boss fights later, no explation for what boss souls do or ascending does, no real choice for dragon selection othe then heres 3 random eggs and you got the same egg across the board, no info on whether the random creatures you get add any bonus to anything. ALSO NO DETAILS REGARDING THE DLC SAYING THAT ONLY 1 WILL WORK AT A TIME! Pros? Music nice, no real bugs but a few, has actual mute button. Yeah the game is only 2 bucks and the chap you made this seems cool but this should have never left the starting line the way it is. Now if the dev is gonna add contect to somthing this far undone, then he needs to be quick paced before this game gets burrired under neg reveiws. If it updates ill update this as well."
,Recommended,529240,31430427,Posted: 28 April,all,Lady Dawn (NeedtoKnow Gaming),"Fun little clicker and, at the moment, that's all you get: a clicker. You click and sometimes, after an absurd amount of clicks, you unlock an upgrade that allows you to increase your damage a bit--but mostly you'll be clicking. If you're hoping for other tasks hold off until the developer starts updating.Updated May 16, 2017Progress!The developer has implemented some of my suggestions regarding balance and rewards for playing actively. Now, if you defeat a monster that's a higher level, you get more experience as opposed to the same amount of experience for every monster. There are also chests to open by clicking from which you can gather resources.There are now multiple profiles, allowing you to start with the other eggs without erasing your save file and also the ability to go back waves so that you can keep beating monsters until your team has enough DPS to fell the boss. It's worked wonderfully and I've done it a few times so I can start getting all of my monsters on the same level.You can enchant your monsters, which increases DPS individually and has helped greatly in making sure that idle play is a more viable option.You can alsoKeep 'em coming~ I'm working on evolving my other monsters now so I can get enough money to buy a farm.---------------------------------------------Outdated versionIt's still a bit too early to write my typical Early Access Report. This will remain a tentative thumbs up as I wait for updates because there's nothing inherently bad about the game except for the lack of content... But then, isn't that what the Early Access phase is meant to address?You choose from one of three starter monsters, each of which start out as eggs. Others are recruited automatically once you defeat them. After your egg hits level five, either by clicking anywhere on the screen a little more than five thousand times or by waiting until you rack up enough idle damage, it hatches.In order to gain gold and exp you can keep clicking, which does the amount indicated on your stat screen (click strength), or you can stay idle and let your monster do the work (DPS). Your monster always does slightly less damage than you--and that's not taking into consideration how quickly you can click. Thus, the idle option isn't viable at the moment because it does a sliver of damage in comparison to the HP of the monsters, which will quickly ramp up to the quadruple digits and beyond while the damage you can inflict remains below 20.Your click damage increases as you level up. You can also increase your idle damage by upgrading the monsters you randomly recruit (currently there are only three, which you'll defeat on a loop, and you can only have one of each time), though that takes a ton of gold. To put it into perspective, I've clicked 12k times and killed over 400 enemies, but I'm still 3000 gold away from buying my first upgrade. This is after leaving the game idle for some time.Only your active monster gains experience. You can tab between them using the arrows at the bottom of the box displaying your monsters.The music is irritating; a constant loop that I immediately muted. The graphics are okay. The portraits are nice and so are the sprites, but everything else looks very mobile/flash game.The biggest problem with Creature Clicker in its current state--other than the lack of content variety, of course--is the balance. Your monster will perpetually be behind in level by 2-3 levels than the enemies, which isn't a problem given that you don't take damage, but a more powerful monster isn't worth much more experience. The grind becomes very real because of this: even if you use a monster at level 0 against a monster at level 10, it will still get bread crumbs for exp.I just ran into my first boss. My starter monster is level 8 and I only do 19 damage.... Yet the fight requires me to do 14k damage in 60 seconds. Not happening. This needs to be patched--and quickly. I'm stuck now; I can't run and there's no way I'm going to put my fingers through that kind of stress because I'm almost certain there's no way I could pull off that feat.Some suggestions to the developer:Balance--This should have been a day one patch because of how unbalanced the game is at the moment. I'll still hold off on a negative review unless it isn't amended.Whether this means adding in more upgrade opportunities, increasing friendly monsters base  damage or making enemies give more experience so that friendly monsters can level up more quickly, the game needs to be balanced better. Grinding is fine, but when there's no reward to the grind, it swiftly becomes stale.Idle monsters should also gain a fraction of experience lest they fall far behind.A map--Different locations would mean different aesthetics and different monsters. You'd also be able to add in mini games and discoverable items.U.I. Improvements-- This needs some cleaning up. The text is tiny and the big, bold boards it's written on doesn't help. The buttons to navigate the screens are huge compared to the information shown on the pages. This should be evened out or even swapped. The text as a whole could be a little larger,Only the starter monsters have portraits. I'd like to see a detailed portrait for every monster as well as a sprite for the starter monsters. You could even place the sprite next to the portrait in the middle box just to keep your team from being bland.The static blue-white background the game is displayed on also leaves a lot to be desired. Jazz it up with a day and night cycle, roaming monsters, etc.Particle effects--It would be nice if clicks looked different depending on which monsters is selected. You could do this based on element or what the monster would use to attack. i.e, a dragon would use a fire blast, the Forest Bee would use a piercing sting, the Thorntail Deer would attack with hooves--and so on.Monsters--It would be nice to be able to rename monsters. All monsters should have acended forms and, of course, we need tons more monster types.Random events--Add events that reward those who play more actively. You could reward players with items, bonus gold/exp, an uncommon monster, etc.The music--It's not great. If you must keep the current track, fine. Adding a few more to the loop wouldn't hurt.Resources?--I haven't yet run into these, but I see that they're listed. These could be mini games (click as fast as you can after seeing an online prompt!) or rewards for exploring. Assuming you create a map.I look forward to updating this once there's more meat to Creature Clicker!"

Very confusig UI with no help to understand how to do things.The art is split.  Some is good some is worse then a lot of the FTP idlers.  This one also has an in game shop despite being a purchased product, which is another bad sign.I played the game for about half an hour, read the forums and learned to really progress you need an auto click script.  This is a turn off for me, as I like games that don't demand a ton of clicking on and on.  But the more you progress, the bigger the benifit of clicking rather then idling, which is totally against the idea of an idling game.Even though I got it on sale for 2$ it's not worth it.  I'd rather give that 2$ to a game that puts effort into a good UI and a fun game, not one that you need to run a script to progress with."

I have every expectation that the end result is going to be fantastic, and it's been a blast exploring everything as it emerges and improves. The value of the purchase price continues to widen as the dev provides more and more to his players at an impressive pace, and I'm excited to watch everything firsthand. =D (Nearly all of the complaints I've noticed in negative reviews have been addressed or improved on in some way since they were made, by the way, and there's no signs of slowing down any time soon!)"

It is just constant clicking that takes so much time out of your day and gets really boring to play. There is nothing special to this game it is just clicking then you look at games like Clicker Heroes and AdVenture Communist and they have so much involved and are so popular. You look at this and you throw up from disgust. So to whoever made this game don't release it. I could make a better game using paper.
76561198067020031,Not Recommended,529240,31729532,Posted: 13 May,all,thefishkebab,"Short TL,DR Version:PROS:+Lots of achievements+CheapCONS:-Bad Music & Sounds-Uninteresting Visuals-Unbalanced & Broken GameplayACHIEVEMENT COUNT: 438TRADING CARDS: Yes (7 Cards, 3 Free drops)Long Review:I first saw this game back in Jan 2017. As someone who plays idle clicker games, seeing ""new take on clicker genre"" I thought that i'd give it a go, but the game had a ""Q1 2017"" release. Cut to today (13th May 2017), when I saw the game had finally become purchaseable. I bought it, installed and clicked play.And boy, what a absolute letdown...where to start?MUSIC: one track in the game, and it's a generic ""happy"" song, which not only doesn't suit the game at all, it's there from the moment you start it up, to the moment you click the mute button.SOUND FX: Terrible. Imagine a lvl-up sound, or a hitting sound, or a pick-up sound. Your sounds are probably better than what's in this game. Plus, the lvl-up sound is FAR louder than anything else (yes, even music), so prepare to be blindsided by it.VISUALS: Clashing. The UI ""wood"" graphics and pale blue background don't change at all throughout the game, making them stagnant around an hour in. The area backgrounds (all 1 square inch of them) are decent and the egg monsters designs are nice (though completely ripped from pokemon), but they clash with the pixel graphics of the monsters. Monsters which have a grand total of 3 choppy animation frames.Edit: The blue background is meant to be a sky. Right... ""sky"".GAMPLAY: Worst part of it.It's tried to combine an idle clicker with a monster RPG, and it's come off weaker because of it. Monsters aren't caught, they're just randomly added to your group.Lvling up a monster just paves the way for more DPS, which you don't need because there a handy ""+#DPS for $"" button which is always there and never increase in price.Only the first 3 wild monsters can get DPS equipment (robotic upgrades) from gold chests (which rarely show up), but it can't be equipped until iLvl50+ AND spend large sums of money on said equipment.The egg that you get at the start doesnt really matter, because the ability is the exact same (2xmonster lvl as click strength (+1 because the dev loves odd numbers)).There's no point to train up any more than 1 wild monster because there is no time limit on the enemy monsters.Aside from cash, the resources (bronze,silver and gold bars) have no real point, aside from a few minor upgrades.Other Notes:This game has a ton of achievements. 400+ i think. But they're all earn X money, kill X monsters, etc. Plus, they're not spaced out. At all. So you WILL earn around 150 in the first 15 minutes.Unlike other clickers, because this game isn't free, you DO NOT have do micro-transactions to get all the trading cards (small consolation but hey, better than nothing)Final Verdict:Unless you want lots of achievements on your profile, stay far away from this game. It's not balanced, not interesting and not worth your time."

This is pretty interesting and I see it having promise in future updates to come in it's current state content wise it is very underwhelming and the intereactiveness with the game is very low. What this amounts to is do not go into this game expecting a huge impactful clicking experience. There is a limited UI aspect to this game but it does not take away from anything in the game. I would say in it's current form it is worth the price point going off the assumption that the game will continue to recieve timely updates.However my biggest problem with the game is probably a feature I can turn off somewhere. The achievement situation in this game is frustrating to me and it feels like it really takes away from the game experience seeing a pop up every few seconds because of how the Achievements are tiered. The inner OCD that I may or may not have goes nuts when playing this game seeing the constant pop ups. To the Developer I would advise maybe trimming back your in game achievements and attaching some sort of permanent reward to them.Anyhow at this time I am going to give this game a good rating in hopes that it gets better."

(for now?)Nad devs should release games ONLY when the game is complete, most of the time games are bad or abandoned/never finished, for me """"Early Access"""" is the worst thing on steam....."
