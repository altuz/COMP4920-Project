,Recommended,529360,28787667,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Shadow,"https://youtu.be/26X_W0X0MPQWell that was unexpectedly fun. I bought Void Rangers based on the other reviews comparing it to games like Borderlands and Diablo but wasn't entirely convinced tbh. I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised and that those reviews are pretty accurate.The game has a pleasing, bright, neon, sci fi look and feel and it works well though I'd like to see more enemy variety. I'm hoping that will come in future levels but for now the silhouettes of the enemies all look very similar.I'm not sure where the music came from but it ranges form calm and serene to some pretty high octane tracks perfect for blowing up bots. I like that there's a track selector in the level.The loadout/inventory system, while a bit confusing at first is a nice feature. Not sure how much I'd use it but interesting non the less. I also really liked the interface for managing items. It needs some polish but I like where it's headed.On that same note, I liked the 'options room' even though there wasn't much in there. I'd like to see a SS slider and other graphical settings added as well as maybe some refinement around the audio sliders. Why did they start off negative??The gameplay. Yes, it's more wave shooter. It's not pointless wave shooter for the sole purpose of getting a high score. It's wave shooter to get more loot!! Yes... I'm a loot ♥♥♥♥♥. I'm entirely suckered in by the loot mechanic. I've yet to see just how varied the loot gets but I REALLY LIKE [extra emphasis] what I've seen so far. I'm not expecting borderlands level of variety but so far it looks promising.That's really a good way to sum up the game. Looks promising. That and unexpectedly a lot of fun. Loot goes a long way as a motivator. Throw some story in here and this becomes one of my new favorites.17.99 may be a bit pricy for the game if the remaining levels are as short as the first few but as of right now I'd say it's probably worth it. Definitely if it ends up on sale."

Envision 32 homing rockets from your right hand and a beam of laser cannon death in your left hand streaking out into deep space and obliterating your foes just as the enemy capital carrier ship's engines detonate, all the while dodging one-shot-death blasters and rocking out to the dark metal of rust2dust's ""Zlom""I just keep finding myself returning to it.  Imagine Space Pirate Trainer (dual wielding akimbo guns and shooting droids), Borderlands/Diablo (money and rare item drops), Mass Effect (setting and some music), and Cowboy Bebop smashed into a supercollider and this is what you get.  If there was a strong storyline (which seems to be materializing) and social aspects (in the pipeline, it has been said), it would be the one to rule them all.  If you wondered what Space Pirate Trainer was training you for, it's Void Rangers.  I'm describing in terms of other games for clarity, but this game is totally original and fresh; even the way you select your loadout/inventory I have never seen before.Enemies are varied, and can be tough.  Shielded units (with two shield emitters) stymie your well-laid strategies and gun choices, while armored boss ships may even kill you with mis-aimed ricochet.  The giant capital ship plasma cannons firing around you make you feel like you're part of a huge battle.The developer is a certified genius... it's hard to imagine one person could build this entire world.  He recently added ground worlds/enemies and rocket cannons, so there is definitely more coming.  As it is, there is virtually unlimited replay value due to the randomly generated loot.  His excellent auto-sell options keep it from being a grind-fest; you spend more time fighting than you do managing inventory/buying/selling, which is the way it should be.Some of the guns are truly spectacular to use (most are common... you really need to earn the good ones).  Fortunately, there are SMGs and other automatic weapons, otherwise it would be carpal tunnel syndrome in a virtual box.  He might be adding auto-triggers so it doesn't end up destroying your wrists like Raw Data.  I wasn't sure about the new metal tracks at first, but now I must seek out the rust on the in-game jukebox.For the love of Zlom, buy this hidden gem of a game.  It has 100% positive reviews, but it's the best game your friends have never heard of."

If you are looking for a shooting game similar to Space Pirates, gun drops like Borderlands, and the ability to go different worlds and levels with never a dull moment to be had, well then this game is for you.Oh yea, you can upgrade your weapons too."
,Recommended,529360,28424990,"Posted: 17 December, 2016",all,PsychoticPanda,"I really enjoyed my time with Void Rangers and found it to be a fun game that I could use to relax after work. While having a few bugs here and their, it runs pretty smoothly and works as you would expect. I got pretty lucky in this game and got a legendary SMG early on that has made the game pretty easy. Since then I now have a multitude of weapons that I consider to be overpowered, and while I keep them on the basis that they are amazing weapons, often like to use the lower teir weapons to remind myself how exciting this game can be.I would recommend this game to any of my friends, but I might suggest waiting for more content because as the game is at the moment you may feel that the game is repetitive if your not into killing the same enemies wave after wave with the only real changes being the amount of health and damage they deal."

There are plenty of levels with good ambiance and varied enemies. I do really like the music, techno, atmospheric and heavy metal. It's pretty much what I'm thinking about when go to a concert, blastin aliens on a far flung moon. For some reason it reminds me of that old Heavy Metal movie. I like the upgrades and the drops. It does remind me of BL which I really like. The campaign or level progression is pretty straight forward and could use some sort of voice acting or something to bring up the entertainment value if the developers wanted to have more of a story element. I do have a hard time dodging as I'm probably still learning the game. I find other VR games that require dogding are a bit more predictable as to when to dogde, but it does show you from where you got hit and by how much. I like how the action can be above and behind especially if you're not looking and fighting well enough. I really like the homing bullets option some do it more than others. I got this epic shot gun... oh man so good. Flamethrower... oh man so good on giant insects. Positional Audio could be better but it could be that I'm too busy rocking out the whole time. Solid wave shooter with some loot rpg elements. It has some room to grow if they want to make it better, but overall I'm glad I got it on sale, it is a good value. Not too many bugs that I've found either.Edit: Oh man Level 8 the game really gets serious."

Not sure how many levels as i'm only in to lvl 5 as I keep farming the lower levels to upgrade my guns to beat the progressivly harder waves of things to fight. WIth awesome boss battles at the end of some of them.Also you get loot after completing each level which usually lasts between 4-10 minutes depending if there is a boss or not on the map.I think it's randomly generated and works well so far it's    Commmon/uncommon/rare/epic/legendary Dont quote me on this.In the short time i've oplayed i've only got up to the 3rd tier or rare so glad to see it's not dropping the best loot right away. It could be that i'm farming the lower levels so i dont get smashed up.Also you can buy armor and resis for your suit which helps for the mobs that hit harder in later levels.you can also buy random weapon boxes for loot but i've been getting pretty awesome guns just completing the quick levels.Overall this is the best experience i've had on the vive so far I've only played acouple hours as of this post i'll check back in as i get through it.And I apologize for the grammar and terrible run on sentences I dont usually leave reviews but I was compelled to at least give my input on what this game has to offer at least for me it's great.ConcreteProdigy
,Recommended,529360,30288310,Posted: 2 March,all,Royale with Cheese,"Fantastic game that deserves a lot more exposure and support.Addictive Diablo/Borderlands style loot feels amazing to actually hold, shoot,and generally go all out ""rambo"" with.Weapons are randomized from common to legendary based on extra bonuses,the variety is already impressive and can potentially be expanded.Stages differ enough to keep things interesting, you got classic floatingspace platforms, alien planets, space cruisers, and a robust ""home"" station.This game can easily support seated/standing experience with a few additions.I suggest implementing a button to rotate 90 degrees, and maybe teleport aroundthe platform with the joystick like in the steamvr lab; or just add a shield."

THIS is how you make a Wave Shooter!Spread the word!"

The environments are varied and look good, I've seen a bunch of enemy types so far and I'm only on level 6 of 20. Upgrading and unlocking weapons and armor adds to replay. Lots of content and lots of fun for 12 bucks."

76561197982882308,Not Recommended,529360,31702895,Posted: 12 May,all,[BND] in4m8ion,"Game shoulda been 'out' a year ago...maybe then it wouldn't seem so underwhelming.shooting is flat and lifeless, aiming isn't even a thing as bullets auto target, even boosted +15 sound effects are quiet and feel underwhelming, none of the weapons have that oomph and satisfaction of something like Space Pirate Trainer, H3, or Sirento VRenemies are dull and only challenge by virtue of being numerous, although the aliens were quiet horrifying when they get right up on ya.the loot feels pointless and overly simple, while ascetically they have a boarderlands look, they are really just mild damage increases or magazine size, side note reloading is automatic and not can't even be done manually, even a button press would be something, but instead just fire off excess rounds between waves.levels are just scenery changes, no movement, no secondary locations, just platforms and waves.game is really just another in a long line of subpar wave shooters, if you want a better loot shooter in VR I suggest Sirento VR, at least there you get to feel some satisfaction of a well executed shot."

,Not Recommended,529360,31812538,Posted: 17 May,all,SalmonGod,"Graphically, it's above average.But otherwise, it's a mindless grindfest.The enemy variation is meaningless.  They either run up and attack you, or they float around and shoot at you.  It doesn't change how you respond to them, so it doesn't really matter.Because the only substance to the game is the rpg loot progression vs enemy scaling, to the point that aiming and dodging are hardly factors at all in comparison.  You point in the general direction of the enemy and shoot.  Your dakka is either sufficient or not.  If not, you'll get money and some random weapon drops off the attempt, upgrade, and try again until winning dakka is achieved.  The variety of weapons is exciting at first, but wears off quickly, once the scaling factors overshadow most of the effect that shooting styles has in the beginning.And the levels are excruciatingly slow paced.  It's a good 15 seconds or so between enemy wave spawns.  They spawn in at such a distance that you can't hit them with anything that doesn't have homing (none of the weapons are hitscan), and take several more seconds to move into combat range.  Ultimately, you'll spend 15 minutes on a level, but maybe 5 minutes of that actually doing anything.Played just under 2 hours and asked for a refund, because I found myself getting impatient and bored waiting for the last couple levels I played to just be over with.  Didn't see myself playing it any further."
,Not Recommended,529360,31740321,Posted: 13 May,all,Zhuril,"This game fails in just about every aspect that comes to mind. Gameplay, progression, audio, immersion.Every gun feels and shoots like a pea shooter, From what I experience, they all make a ""tink"" noise when the bullets hit just about anything.The progression system is completely broken in the sense it feels like I had a cheat code turned on that I couldn't disable. The price of weapon boxes seem to scale with your progressions in level. But from what I experience, you can sell the weapons you get out of a box for more than what you spent on the box 80% of the time, the other 20% you get most of your money back. Ultimately I started off with a few thousand moneys, and ended up with 100k in a couple minutes just selling the stuff back.I eventually found myself with a homing shotgun not to long into my box-opening journey and upgraded the crap out of the thing. I did a few levels closed my eyes and aimed my homing shotgun at the spawnpoint and pushed the trigger as fast as possible and deleted everything that thought of spawning. (~10 pellets from a shotgun all homing on 1 target is basically god mode -- even against bosses)All up until I hit level 4, where the boss appeared to take no damage, and moved over my ""character"" blacking out my screen and making me invulnerable. I would have backed out to the menu and restarted the level, but it seems like a menu wasn't even developed either.Just play Space Pirate Trainer. the only ""innovation"" this game brings is a progression system, but it's incredibally imbalanced and needs serious tuning before it is truly innovative. It boils down into the user just getting weapons that deal rediculous damage and you don't even need to aim. Destroying the aspect of skill required in a shooter and eliminating all sense of a challenge. Space Pirate Trainer plays much smoother, the weapons are much funner, they feel good, and the enemies / projective are better conveyed.This game feels like the developer kind of experimented with something as part of a side project and threw it on the market without any kind of finishing or refinement."

It happens usually during mid-wave and never recovers.  Others are having this issue and the dev has not responded to my email or forum post.When it isn't crashing, I do enjoy the music and being able to upgrade my weapons to be able to progress further.

You can have fun shooting stuff, and it brings a bunch of different enemies and weapons to do just that. Weapons also have different stats like in a rpg, and you get a lot of loot after the map. It does however have a lot of glitches, like enemies running through objects. The animations and effects also leaves a lot to be decired. It wasn't quite for me, but I can absolutly see people who enjoy arcade waveshooters enjoy this game, but for me it was to much arcade. You dont even reload, just fire at everything you see moving."

Using a rift, vive users might not be having this issue.

,Recommended,529360,31989964,Posted: 26 May,all,BeRadical,"This game is close to being really good. It needs some serious balance work done. The enemies are either way too easy or way too hard. The weapons are either way too weak or way too overpowered. The loot crates could be more fun (more interesting weapon upgrades). There's some serious slowdown on some levels (level 9 in particular). Graphics are good. Enemies could have better sound to help determine their position. Enemies could have more interesting movement too, they just seem to spawn and randomly fly around a bit. Overall it's a decent game compared to what's out there for VR right now but it could be improved."
