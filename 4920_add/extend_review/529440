,Recommended,529440,33677904,Posted: 20 July,all,KaynSD,"The game started as a joke. The entire development process was one long pun chain of purposely (or not) getting the Beautiful Game wrong. Every furious correction sent in by someone who wasn't in on the joke ended up spurring the developer into zanier and more purposely wrong territories; Premiere League being the lowest one (obviously it's the one you Premiere in), the Offside rule being a side of the pitch you're not allowed to stand on. An oval round pitch a hundred meters in length, and the game split into two divisions with variable scoring based on how far away from the goal you were when you did it. It purposely ignores anything remotely connected to serious research. It wallows in it's own ignorance and subsists on the grinding of teeth from people who treat sportsball too seriously.And we love you for it Dan. Never change.As for the game itself, a quick action game with a passing similarity to football. Quicktimey tackles, power meter charged kicks, uncontrollable and incompetant goldkeepers and an extra time mode that requires picking up actual extra time. A story mode that forces you to learn the abilities of the game piecemeal (and a tutorial mode that tells you off for not playing it), and a quick match mode with disturbingly way too many options for such a small game.Best football game I own. Okay. That's faint praise. But you should also buy it and make it the best football game you own too."

I was hoping for something addicting in the vein ofRocket League, but I got something more reflecting this price point.Essentially, this is football/soccer with an alternate rule set and arena.There are 'wind up' mechanics for shooting and tackling. Because tackling and shooting happen so often, I think the 'wind up' breaks the flow of the game, but that's probably just me. There is also this weird sidedness to tackling; it is much easier to successfully steal the ball when the opponent is going south. Again, not sure if this is intended, but it feels strange. The controls in general can be a bit finnicky. The career mode was a great way to actually add some actual content. You earn money and upgrade your team. In fact, you can't even pass the ball in a predictable way when you start.Pros:+The best humor I've experienced in a game in a long while.+The artwork is nice; lots of polish.+Career mode is a great way to keep people playing; I like spending money to upgrade the team.Cons:-Why oh why would you design a game with controller support in mind, yet not have controller support in the menus?-I cannot stand how slow you move when you are holding the ball. I can't figure out if that was a deliberate design decision to just get you to constantly pass the ball up the field, or just take pot shots at the goal from wherever you are at.-I am having a hard time getting good 'feedback' from other opponents around me and how they steal the ball from me. They don't have the 'wind up' like I do, so it's strange.-What if the wind up cone narrowed instead of widening? On paper, that makes more sense to me because you are taking more time to line up your shot AND it would not break the flow of gameplay as much.The saving grace is the price point.It's fun, but I don't see myself dumping in a ton of hours."

It's also really fun to play.After playing through the Tutorial (or feeling really bad for not doing so), you start at the bottom of the league with a team of guys that pretty much can't do anything. However, as you start doing goals and winning games, you start unlocking abilities and earning money to upgrade your players.The abilities you unlock include passing (which is extremely well implemented and pleasing to use), giving effect to the ball after a big kick, and others like better tackling (also a really cool mechanic), sprinting and dashing to avoid enemy players.The difficulty curve seems pretty fair: the first match is quite easy, and after that you'll find lots of teams that will literally give you a run for your money.And on top of that, the story mode is filled with hilarious dialogue and fun characters.All in all, a really recommended purchase, even more so at the ridiculous price tag it's set. If you're even mildly curious about it, give it a go, it's certainly worth your time."

,Not Recommended,529440,33949761,Posted: 1 August,all,Tanox Branar,"I bought this game after seeing Nerdcubed's video on it because it looked so fun! And it is...to begin with.The sense of humour and the whole design of the game is imbeccable, it's great fun, strangely immersive even though it's ridiculous, I can't fault the design of the game in that sense at all. And the first league is great fun to play through, but this is where things change, and why I wouldn't be willing to recommend the game just yet.The difficulty curve, if we can call it that, suddenly takes an enormous jump. Aside from the ocassional glitches that are still in the game, the AI suddenly remembers it is a computer and can kick your sorry meat♥♥♥♥♥♥without even trying if it wants to. And it does! Quite suddenly the ball is being passed around the pitch from player to player at such an incredible rate you'll be lucky to know where on the pitch you even are any more. A bit of speedy silly play does fit in with the theme of this game, but it reaches such an insane speed it is literally untouchable, borderline un-seeable. At present as well, you have to get used to successful tackles somehow resulting in their player not losing the ball, your defenders refusing to ever be behind the halfway line in some games, the auto-select of players (for you may not do this yourself) is often very unhelpful, either not selecting anyone near the opposition with the ball, or randomly changing your selection when you want to tackle to someone who is not in a useful position, and then the game won't let you try and tackle again for quite some time.This game will be brilliant, I don't doubt that, as long as it keeps being updated and improved. I just don't know how long we will have to wait for these things to be improved on, because at the moment they are taking the silly fun this games offers and turning it into an infuriating affair that is best described more as a video than a game, because all you can do it watch, and feel just a bit humiliated as the AI keeps passing the ball across your goal at 200mph because none of your team are even in your own half...I'm looking forward to changing my recommendation to yes, because I feel confident it will happen, it's all there! It's just not meshing right yet :)"

It was the greatest thing I've ever done with a computer.7/10 normal football wishes it was this adequate.
76561198014384587,Not Recommended,529440,34069780,Posted: 6 August,all,threepwood,"This game started out really fun. Then I made the mistake of winning a few matches; that's when I discovered that the game's difficult scales based on the assumption that you're able to bring in loads of money per goal, so that you can train your team to come at least vaguely close to keeping up with the AI. Alas, even after all the matches I've won and lost in the weeks since I bought this, I still score lots of 0/1 pound (note: not sure how to abbreviate pounds sterling appropriately, sry) goals, with the occasional 100-200 goals. I think I saw one for about 750 once....maybe. I may have imagined it. But since training is expensive, I quickly found myself in a spot where the AI was making laser-like passes and goals, stealing the ball from me at its whim, while I would apparently fail to even gather the ball after running right into it. While I'd love to take more of the blame for this, I fear that there may also be an issue of clunky controls that aren't nearly as responsive as this game needs them to be.Despite having grown frustrated with the game early on, I was going to give it a positive recommendation....until I saw the patch notes for the 1.5 patch. The developer claimed that this patch addressed some of the negative feedback about this game, so I fired up the game again to see how different it felt. With my team in 17th place, the AI once again manhandled my team and I ended the match without bringing in a single penny. In 18th place, winning was too easy, but I didn't bring in nearly enough money for even a single upgrade to my team.  But goal scoring still feels just-managable enough that I don't feel like I can start doing whatever the game expects me to do to bring in more money when I finally score. In other words, same old poor scaling.Even after the improvements, I still had a major problem: The automatic selection of which player you control. I can't count the number of times I've wanted to control a player who was actually near the ball (but couldn't, because the computer decides who you control), or the number of times when I've been charging in for a tackle, only to have the computer switch players so my slide tackle is done by someone neither near the ball nor even facing it. This, perhaps more than anything else, is what made the game frustrating for me. (A close second is when the computer starts intercepting every pass that comes near it, while my players do nothing of the sort. Or when the computer starts stealing the ball even time it wishes, while my attempts to steal are far less predictable.)What mostly pushed me over the line toward a negative recommendation is the dev's statement of ""it's supposed to be a difficult game."" Upon reading this, I concluded the following: This isn't a difficult game, it's a poorly-designed game with awkward controls and a lack of attention to difficulty scaling. (Not to mention that the game does next-to-nothing to show the player how to succeed at the game's most important mechanic, that of maximizing money earned per goal.) Hearing the dev suggest otherwise sounds arrogant and out-of-touch to me.Also, I've grown sick to death of the opening music, and button texts and match win/loss notes seem about as vacant as the typical meme...but they just keep showing up. In other words, I've quickly grown tired of this game's tedium and I don't want to fire up the game any more.To be fair, the first couple hours with the game were quite fun, so if you think the price is low enough to see if you also enjoy it -- either at first, or possibly for much longer -- then, by all means, give it a go. The game certainly feels like it has loads of potential, when you first start playing.Also, note that the game gives a strong (in-game) recommendation to be played with a console-style controller. Perhaps if I'd done so, I've be having an entirely different experience with the game."

While it can be frustrating (especially since the enemy can pass much quicker and more effectively than you can, and at times they seem destined to score), losing is just a minor setback, and really just means you get to play more matches. My only real complaint is there's not enough of the cutscene/visual novel elements. I get a little sad every time I don't get more story bits after completing a match."

,Not Recommended,529440,34115926,Posted: 8 August,all,AudioSuede,"I genuinely love the writing and humor in this game. The character designs are delightful, and the satirical bent of the project is extremely charming.But the game has serious technical problems. Tackling and passing are Russian Roulette in terms of whether they will actually do what the player wants; sometimes the tackling ""possession"" reticle appears, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes it appears and then disappears, sometimes it appears, changes color to the one that enables possession for the player, but the ball or the character just bounce off in another direction. For passing, sometimes it just flies across the field in the opposite direction. The A.I. is extremely buggy. Enemy teams have a tendency to run the ball into the corner where they get stuck until you try to tackle them, which serves only to dislodge them and run past you to score a goal. And things aren't better on the goalkeeping side. If anything, they're much worse. In terms of settings, attempts to turn down the grating music failed; turning the volume down did absolutely nothing. An opening prompt strongly recommends a controller, but the controller cannot select some menu items, requring a mouse and keyboard to navigate.But the most egregious issue is not a glitch but a design choice: You can't change your character on defense. The game auto-selects the character that you're controlling and switches at random, presumably trying to select whoever is closest to the ball, but just as often selecting someone far behind the ball or in no position to reach the ball. If you try to tackle and it fails, you're stuck with that character until it auto-selects someone else, which might be fine except for the aforementioned hit detection issues and the fact that at least half the time the character the game switches you to is behind the opposing player with their stamina depleted because the A.I. was sprinting independently for some reason. The left trigger of the controller is totally open, too, which leaves room if the developer can figure out a way to patch in a way to cycle through nearby characters. A lot of the technical issues could be overcome if the player was able to quickly regain control by selecting another nearby character. It would probably help with some of the outrageous difficulty spikes, as well.I didn't have a hard time winning, for the most part, but I had a hard time getting the game to respond accurately to my inputs.I really hope the dev can figure out some of these issues, because as it stands it's a charming, funny, potentially addictive game marred by technical difficulties."

I believe my cousin owned it and frequently brought it with him when his family was over at ours, and we played it a bunch over the years.Eventually he got bored of it, I forgot the game and the football games got more and more serious. That game ended up being the only football video game I played during the first 25 years of my life. Perhaps there have been more arcade football games over the years but either they haven't scratched the same itch or I've missed the good ones, either way it looked like I might never play a football game again......until I ran into the dev tweeting about this happy little accident. Forget your fifas and pesses, they got it all wrong: This game is what they should thrive to be. Psyonix proved it with Rocket League (Disclaimer: which, according to a statement by Size Five Games, is not a football game), Size Five Games echoes it with Kickmen: You can't directly copy a sport to make a sports game. Sports are not fun, as proven by studies. Thus, a realistic game about sports can not be fun.Maybe there isn't a real study that proves what I said but the point is, this game is basically a game that happens to be football themed, not a football theme that's been made into a game.The menus kinda suck though so I'm torn between giving this game 6 or 7 points out of ten, but at least I can whole heartedly say that this is the very second best football game I've ever played."

This game pokes fun at every stereotype the game of football and its fans throw up. Funny writing and an intriguing take on the usual football controls makes this game an interesting little package.The game offers only two modes of play but truth be told you are only ever going to play one and the tutorial.I won’t give too away any of the story but the game mechanics have you improving your team through skills, some you unlock only by winning other you spend money to improve.Let’s move on to the actual kicking of the ball (the most important part of the game). The controls are simple and easy to pick up. Passing, shooting, tackling, dashing and dodging are the controls with added after touch for curling the ball. Add in some wacky offside rules, goals counting for more depending on how far away they are and earning more money based on how entertaining you are.  All in all a fun little game, how long it stays entertaining is still to be determined.  For £2.50 its 100% worth a shot.Not only would I recommend it I’m looking forward to getting back to playing it."

There Scipio Africanus, the savior of Rome in the darkest days of the Punic Wars, found Hannibal Barca. The latter had left Carthage in exile when the Romans demanded his surrender seven years after his defeat at the hands of the former, lest he rebuilt the broken city to its former glory.It is not often such great generals meet outside the blood and gore of the battlefield and thus the conversation between them fell to whom they ranked as the greatest generals of antiquity. Hannibal answered Alexander ranked highest and though Scipio was dismayed, they could all agree that Alexander was without equal. When asked who ranked second, Hannibal answered Pyrrhus, the Greek general who was the first to bring the young Roman republic to its knees. Scipio then asked whom he ranked third and Hannibal, without hesitation answered that it was himself who ranked third.Scipio, hurt in his pride that the victim in his greatest success would rank themselves above their victor, asked where then would Hannibal place himself if he had won at the Battle of Zama? And Hannibal answered that beyond doubt, then he would place himself before even Alexander.Scipio didn’t answer again, instead kicking a pig bladder at Hannibal, through his legs and in between two vases standing in the corner of the gymnasium. He pulled his toga over his head and galloped to the crowd with his hands in the air.And so, the game of football was born, though it wouldn’t be rediscovered until the 1990’s in England, where some rich people decided they could be a lot richer still by asking people a lot of money to watch other people play. Soon, instead of playing football, people decided that they could make a game that was like football, but played on computers instead, so they didn’t have to go outside and get dirty.You can kick the ball, run around with the ball, pass the ball, tackle other people who have the ball and if you want to pull your shirt over your head and run around yelling “goal, goal, goal”, you can do that while playing Behold the Kickmen on your computer.

The music is fantastic.As for gameplay, well, it's football innit? Kick the ball, do goals, run about, and avoid the offside rule. Fairly self explanatory. Sure there are some minor gameplay kinks, but overall it runs fine on my laptop and is a good laugh. The mechanic of earning more money for hyping up the crowd with teamwork and skillful play, versus just punting the ball across the pitch and hoping for the best (my preferred strat), gives the story mode matches a decent amount of depth too.

Am admiteddly in the Venn diagram of football fan and indie-game-player who-wants-to-laugh-at-football.The gameplay was initially a little frustrating, but that's because of the muscle-memory of hours of playing traditional/standard football games (i.e Sensible Soccer, Fifa) which have a completely different dynamic (obviously!) Eventually, the rhythm of tackling and big-kicking becomes  satisfying. The tackling mechanic especially is clever and unexpected, but adds an important tactical dimension to the use of a skill (i.e. tackling willy nilly doesn't really get you anywhere.... but is quite fun.)LIKE ANY GAME just PERSEVERE and HAVE FUN LEARNING an hour or two and it'll come.

I'd go a bit higherIf you've read any of the reviews and the preamble on this page you'll have picked up on the conceit here, that it's a football game written by a non football fan who didn't do the research. And yet, you get the feeling that that may not be strictly true...Certainly the general feel of the title is that of a less polished Sensible Soccer or Kick Off type title - both stalwarts of the arcade football genre. That the rules are quite blatantly wrong seems if anything to make things more accessible, the offside rule in particular.My main gripe therefore is with the fact that this is only single player - the idea of having a knockabout with a more straightfaced FIFA or PES fan would make for a great experience, as the initial joke game feel gives way to something more arcadey. However, I can see how two player control in this setup would rapidly become unwieldy, as the ball moves very quickly, particularly in later matches.I realise in this that I haven't covered the Story mode, which is the key to this game as currently set up. It's all a bit Speed Racer and manga in styling, with an overblown melodrama that suits this game to the ground. If football doesn't appeal, the secret future deathsport mode is worth a look, somehow combining the gameplay with a style more akin to early Bitmap Brothers titles (you know which one I mean).One thing I would say though is do the tutorial mode first - for an arcade title, the controls can be a bit finicky compared to the one button and a stick approach of the aforementioned Kick Off type games.
