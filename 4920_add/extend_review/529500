,Not Recommended,529500,25887550,"Posted: 6 October, 2016",all,Kel Varnsen,"I purchased this game based on its 7 first reviews, which were positive.However, I found this game to be dull, poorly optimized, and with a bad choice of locomotion (touchpad to walk in the direction you are facing).The game relies on cheap jumpscares of which there are only 2 different kinds (spectre appears/stuff gets thrown around), which happen far too often.Soundwise not much quality there either, same sounds used over and over.Since you have no control over your walking speed and no locomotion options, you move terribly slow. Becomes a real pain since the game requires you to find some objects or keys and then have you walk all the way back.Overall 2.5/10, requesting refund. Sorry devs : ("

Its not accurate it like floats away from you and or towards you depending on how you move. Hard to explain but you will notice it but after you start playing its not bad.Micro judder in some spots.Overall:9/10 I really loved this game apparetnly there are four endings and I'm gonna attempt to unlock all of them not sure how though."

Ambience was very good and the jump scares were ""ok"", only one that really got me was theChair.I was ok with the touchpad movement, but wish it included the Teleport as well for non touchpad users."

,Recommended,529500,26014531,"Posted: 13 October, 2016",all,Killer_Nads,"I think playing a game such as Onward has really helped me combat against motion sickness now, because moving in a vr world using the thumb pad doesn't make me sick very quickly anymore. In fact sometimes, i end up jogging on the spot to virtualise the walk in the game and it works quite well.However, where this game really excels is the environment and atmosphere. It just feels amazing being inside that house, i actually felt i was inside someone elses house and that i was walking around it. Ofcourse, this worked best when i didn't use the thumb pad and instead used my own feet to move around and peek around corners and doors! What a feeling that is.The atmosphere and sound in the game is very scary and there are some nice jump scares too, but i have only completed the first floor of the house so far so I'm still quite early into it. Ive heard its pretty much the same from other reviewers all the way through, i hope not because the scare factor will wear out very quickly otherwise. I hope things keep getting scarier.However, all that said and done, where this game really is amazing is it makes you feel like you are in a real horror film, like in a real haunted house! It was damn scary and i like that :)One awesome part , was when i saw a shadow enter a room and i actually spoke loudly saying ""hello is someone there?"". Immersion can not get better then this!I really hope the devs continue to improve this game and add more content, because it can truly be an amazing game."
76561198331461334,Recommended,529500,26458715,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,Ctrlvr,"Early Review...So far - I quite like this game. It's got a good creepy atmosphere; the audio is suspenseful and the graphics are quite good in my view. Yes, there's wandering about as some other reviewers have referred to - I'd rephrase it to 'exploring'! The jump scares are subtle e.g. it's not over the top; and so far no hordes of Zombies - I like this slower change of speed. In a sense the game is more akin to games like PSX Resident Evil 1 as in - explore; find key; jumpscare; explore; find key...but no Zombies - so far! The movement is gamepad style but in VR with the motion controller - you push forward to move the direction you wish to go; there is no teleporting and in my experience of the game no nausea either. If in the end the game bores me senseless as I get deeper into it I'll adjust my review slightly to highlight that, however, nearly an hour in and I'm not bored yet - there are many other Vive games which have bored me much quicker for a higher price!Compared to some other games for the Vive, £10 seems to be about right as a price - only just though. I think if you're an old skool gamer who prioritizes exploring and atmosphere in a big empty house with millions of doors to open and rooms to explore over big, loud, brash in your face action, then, you may find you enjoy this game - if not refund it!"

76561197988533180,Recommended,529500,29766226,Posted: 7 February,all,Shovelface,"When I stepped into this game, my first thought was, ""Oh ♥♥♥♥...""I immediately felt like I was in a childhood nightmare, terrified in my grandparents basement hallway because the lightswitch was at the end, and you had to brave it in the dark past open doors where anything could be hiding in the shadows, waiting to pull you into hell. Thay is what this game is at every second, and I can only play for a few short while before I need a break to recover my courage.8/10 - amazing first attempt in the VR horror genre. Other developers should take cues from this game on how to create atmosphere. I can't even imagine how scary these are going to be when you guys really figure this stuff out."

I played this game with my daughters for 2 hours, loving every minute of it. Then got to the very end of the game and... died... I had no idea what killed me or why. So now I have to restart the whole game (no saved game!) a replay *all of it* if I even just want to find out what killed me, must less try to beat the game and get one of the good endings. Not likely to happen.To the devs: I will redo my review if you fix this problem. Or point me to how to save the game properly.To potential buyers. Other than this, this really is a good game. I actually think it's scarier and more fun than Paranormal Activity (well, pros and cons to both) though not as good as A Chair in a Room: Greenwater, though that is a really high bar to compare to."

,Recommended,529500,26571798,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,Shadow,"https://youtu.be/8epnltQfy40Psychological horror with multiple endings!Alone VR is primarily a psychological horror game. It doesn't rely on cheap jump scares to get the job done. It's going to rely on ambient noises and it's ability to convince you there's someone over your shoulder about to get you.Don't get me wrong there are a few jump scares but they're well done and not abused. In fact I'd say they rely too much on the psychological aspect so much that you almost get numb to a few of the sounds.But if that's my main critique then the games doing pretty well.For the most part you're walking around the house picking up various pieces of the story as you try to find your lost sister whom you haven't seen in years. She seems to be an idiot that found a door she shouldn't have and started playing with magic... Bad things started happening after that.Along the way there are a few puzzles that need to be solved. I came across a piano that was missing 3 keys, a statue that needed to be placed somewhere and a few random screws. No idea what these do yet but the one puzzle I did complete was a piano note based puzzle.On the piano puzzle. I had some difficulty with that as the vive controller wasn't very precise when hitting notes. I had to go to the outside of the note to get it to pick up or it hit the one next to it. It's easier to see in the video than explain in text but I'd like them to revisit that as it makes the puzzle a bit frustrating when you think you have the answer and it doesn't seem to be working.All in all, it's a well done game. Give it a go if you're into the horror genre. Or pick it up just to drop some unsuspecting victim into that world. }:)"

I took a chance and got it myself because I'm a huge fan of horror and VR. This game was great. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to show it off to my friends and family. In my opinion the price tag is worth it for the entertainment I will be getting from show casing this game to others. During my own time playing it there where moments of suspense and terror that gave me the quick shock and even goosebumps. If you're a fan of VR and horror together give this game a shot. The locomotion take a little time to get used to but once you've adapted and get used to it, the game is a fun play through. I hope this helps those who are reconsidering the purchase due to its ""mixed"" reviews."

So, I also love the multiple endings! But, the only thing that could (and should) be changed is when your at an ending and you want to find other endings, you have to start ALL OVER! Which is a little annoying. But thats my only complaint. Otherwise perfect graphics, good scares, and the setting gives me the horror spook!"

As for jumpscares there very boring and not scary at all just something like a painting coming off the wall or something fallling of shelves. overall i wouldn't recommend and defiently not worth £10.99, i would still refund if £3.99!"

,Not Recommended,529500,28638342,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Harvester of Sorrow,"This game has several things that work in it's favor, but overall it has more things going against it that quickly made this game become stale and uninteresting.Pros:I do like how the game has a ""free roaming"" style allowing you to venture around the house. Definitely makes you feel more in control of the experience.Lighting is perfect and keeps you on your toes.Graphics aren't half bad; not great, but not terrible.Negatives:Jump scares were predicatble and cheesy. Within the first 5 mintues the same scare tatic of a picture flying off the wall was used twice. First time, you got me good. Second time within minutes, c'mon now don't fall back on the same gimmicks.A horror game needs to have a foundation built on an increasingly intense and creepy atmosphere, without it the game either gets off on the wrong foot and doesn't succeed or it doesn't become innovative as it progresses and dies off. Alone VR fell victim to the latter.Eventually the veil was lifted and I could see the cheap jump scares coming from a mile away, resulting in me becoming quickly bored of the game.Alone VR has potential to become great, but at it's current $15 price point I can't find a strong reason to justify spending that amount of money based on the quality of the experience I've had thus far."

Although most of the scares are just jump scares, where they throw stuff at you.  I have only played through the 1st level, so im hoping its a bit more freaky in the later levels. The VR controls are a bit odd, sorfa like onward except there is no strafing, just forward and backward. Some of the reviews here are over Hyping this game a bit its not AMAZING just good 7/10, if they just keep throwing stuff at you through out the rest of the game the review might go down.
