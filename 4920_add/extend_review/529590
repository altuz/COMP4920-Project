,Recommended,529590,29351811,Posted: 19 January,all,Odd,"This is an EXTREMELY fun alternative to the original game. Soft and slow but with lots of humor and surprise, just like the last one.A few minor complaints:Some graphics tend to glitch through each other, such as the sleeve of the guy's arm, or the screwdriver through the lockers at the back.The crosshair used for button pushing seems to have some unwieldy issues, such as pushing a button it wasn't directly pointed at. Otherwise I must have really big fingers in the game.Lastly, some spare animation and sound issues, where the hammer won't hit, or screwdriver won't make the ""denied"" sound.Besides that, this is a wonderful game, and thanks to the devs for the 50% off coupon to get this game!"
,Recommended,529590,32290134,Posted: 9 June,all,JoshuaDMC,This game was a great remake of the 2D version of this game. New and revamped old puzzles plus a few easter eggs I was able to find still drew my attention and amazement that the first game brought me. Even if you do not think the price is worth it you can still play the 2D version of this game for $5. Although you will miss out on a little buddy in this one. Here is a video of me playing and you can determine if it is worth the price or not for yourself.https://youtu.be/CmT0vp7Hb7I

Aside from some of the buttons being a bit off so it can be hard to put in a code but aside from that everything's fine and dandy.I love the game and for every puzzle solver out there: I recommend it.Finding the solution to a puzzle is insanely rewarding, I gotta say."

This is one those games that stands out - not only as a smooth and fun experience, but as a finished product (honestly, I don't approve of half/third/millionth-finished products with a price tag to it).The whole idea of a 'escape room' in a mind-blowing envelope in VR looks amazing.

,Recommended,529590,29367785,Posted: 19 January,all,refreshing firecum,"Oh, the wonderful remake of the original. I must say, you guys have outdone yourselves. The game looks great, and plays very well, as I get about 60 FPS all the time. Of course, some of the buttons are misplaced making it hard to get the perfectionist achievement, but nonetheless the game is great. I just have 1 small bug report: As of now, the perfectionist achievement is impossible to get. I don't mean it's too hard to get, but i mean actually impossible. There is just one place in the entire game that messes this achievement up entirely, and that is Ending 16. The part that messes up is the ""third wave"" if you will. After killing the 3 and then the 5 (Possibly 6) blood clots, you have to damage the blood baby. after you do it's wave 3, but this wave holds something mischevious. The first time you swing your hammer on this part, it will not register, thus making the achievement ""Perfectionist -1"" as i call it, which makes it not possible. I hope you guys are able to fix this sometime in the near future, as I have done the game twice without doing anything extra. Either way the game is still definently worth buying and  you Devs, Artists, and Coders did a very exellent job. 10/10. :)"

Hmm, seems like a no brainer here.If you enjoy puzzle games and the satisfaction of trial and error you'll love this!If you've played the original, you'll still have enough to play around with for it to feel worth while, plus a lot of the endings are discovered quite differently.Despite being similar to the original, the endings are all reimagined in 3d and with the addition of VR some of the endings can be quite SPOOKY.

,Recommended,529590,29493558,Posted: 25 January,all,Mr. Guggleywubbins,"If you've played the 2D version, this game is a fantastic VR reimagining of the original with a surprising amount of polish and several new outcomes to puzzle out. While around 2/3 of the puzzles are still the same, there appear to be about 10 new ones so far, and several of the old ones have been changed with new mechanics. If you haven't played the original in a while, you may find it's a lot harder to remember than you thought.If you haven't, even better. The less you know going into this game, the more fun you'll have. (Challenge Mode: Don't look up anything.)There are still a couple remaining issues in the v2.0 release (e.g., some objects getting frozen in place and some of the mechanisms being a bit clunky to use at times), but for the most part, everything works as it should. To top it off, the devs kindly gave out 50% off coupons to the owners of the original game, making this a steal at $7.50 USD and a great way to show off your VR system.Or you can just play it in 3D mode, but where's the fun in that?"

Although it took me some time to figure out how to start.Positive:+ makes fun in VR and works well+ in the end this is an achievment hunting gameNegative:- interactions are not always very good- sometimes it is very unclear what to do with a certain element (but i guess that is part of the game design)

76561197971083574,Recommended,529590,29548138,Posted: 28 January,all,VoxMoose,"Brilliant and entertaining puzzle game.  Fun, dark humor.  Occasionally quite abstract and non sequitur, with portal-esque dystopian overtones.  Many nods to games in the same genre. I suggest having lots of scratch paper handy.  The premise is deceptively simple: all the puzzles take place in one non-descript control room, but the number of puzzles per unit volume is surprisingly high.    After about 10 hours, the puzzles get progressively harder to solve (find!), but it is worth the journey if you like puzzle games.  The 3D enviornment ads a really nice touch."
,Recommended,529590,30734141,Posted: 25 March,all,QuietGrave,"A great follow up to it's parent title. I'm knocking off points for it basically being a retail-priced remake, but if you own the first one, you can get it half-price. There are a few new puzzles (which is refreshing) and some more easter eggs but essentially it has about 4 hours of gameplay and limited appeal in VR. Though it certainly isn't the most boring game in the world, I won't be going back to it anytime soon. 4/5"

,Recommended,529590,29424248,Posted: 22 January,all,Doc,"Please, Don't Touch Anything 3D is an expansion on what made the original game so clever. Stylistically, it is on point. Nothing in the game is as it seems, and the atmopsheric soundtrack that accompanies the visuals help make those reveals feel exactly as they are supposed to.In the game, you are confined to a chair in a small room. Your goal is to do whatever you want. Maybe press the button? Maybe don't? But once you do, you embark on a quest to solve as many of the games puzzles, all hidden in one tiny room, as you can. Players of the original will find many more puzzles to solve, as well as fresh takes on the ones they already know.If you never played the original, I'll never not recommend it. But this version is essentially everything that made that one great, but better!It also supports VR if you're into that sort of thing. I'm not, but this game almost made me want to get one so I could experience the insanity up close."

However, some issues are present. The sound of the door shutting when the man leaves is slower than the actual motion of the door.Vive-Port IssuesButton pushing is finicky because the only way you can push is with the actual controller, and never with a point-and-trigger setup, which makes certain inputs somewhat hard to usewith a hand as large as 5 of them and no real feel for its hitbox. The hand might have worked great with Rift's Touch controllers, but the Vive wands are different beasts altogether. In addition, for some reason the pointing mode is configured to use a radial vector from the control's sensor ring rather than straight out the top of the handle section. This is far more difficult to manage than pointing the longest axis of the controller at the object you want to grab/use (i.e. how SteamVR works). And since SteamVR uses a different pointing axis, it also requires you to think a lot harder about what you actually want to point at.The awkward controls mean this game is, while fun, difficult to properly use in places (i.e.phone style numberpad, I II III panel). Until the controls are better sorted for Vive controllers, I can't recommend this game. At least not at full price."

Normally I love puzzles, but I wasn't able to get really into this game. I just didn't get a ton of enjoyment from finding all of the seemingly arbitrary endings - then to do it all over again with no story holding it together.Also, I played this game on the vive and also didn't think the vive integration was the best. The ability to pickup things from a distance worked out weirdly sometimes when random things would just accidentally pop into my hands. Also, none of the puzzles in particular made any special use of VR, but I guess that's because the game was made in 3D first, then ported to vive."

Pressing the reset button without having finished a puzzle causes a never ending black screen, and pressing it when I've finished a puzzle gives me the poster/ornament, but I can't place it down, meaning I have to restart the game to do anything.

But there are quite a few surprise endings that I found startling and unexpected. Suddenly, without warning, you're in a horror environment.On the store page they should show some of the potentially scary things that could happen. Not showing that content is misleading before you buy the game.

,Recommended,529590,35236035,Posted: 26 September,all,The Big Bad Wolf,"TL;DR: A great one to buy on sale if you like non-linear puzzle games.Ooh, this one is a tough one to review.On the one hand, I like the concept. On the other, I'm eternally frustrated that there's no clear line to the ""right"" ending.Usually, when I play a game I want to know I'm making progress. That I'm making the right choices. That I can improve if I spend long enough and try hard enough. Sadly, that's not the case with PDTA3D.Most of the time, the only way forward in this game is to randomly smack buttons or hit things with the hammer. In fact, the primary key to getting deeper towards most of the 30 possible solutions is an obscure doodle there's no reason to think about that early on.I hate that.I MUCH prefer puzzle games that (make things hard but) lead from one clue to the next with enough diligence.That said, PDTA3D is fun. A lot of fun. Frustrating, but fun.Given that you're just standing in one room and not much is going on, I'm not a big fan of the $15 price point for the game. Sometimes it feels worthwhile, usually it feels like it's overpriced. Definitely buy this one on sale if you like puzzles and you don't mind struggling blindly towards a ""win"" with no clear pathway."
