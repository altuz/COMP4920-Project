Don't get me wrong, i'm a competitive player 99% of my game are multiplayer climbing the aldders. But this one here is a gem. A must play, the very moment you will discoer how to build one spell correctly you will be amazed, but then you just scratch the surface.The complexity of a spell can be to the limit of your mana + wand one spell can litteraly include 5 spell repeating themself over and over until you are out of mana... but the room will be completely clear.This is the first time i ever take time to post a review on steam, and this game worth my time ! Thanks to the team behind the game it is a game i will play for many years from time to time!"
,Recommended,529660,31895666,Posted: 21 May,all,Sunkisses_,"Bought this game on impulse, and it was absolutely excellent.The spellcrafting system is actually interesting and purposeful, with all the spells you can make being functionally different. Most games centered around this sort of thing will still only have a few /functionally/ different spells, with the only real difference being stats, but not this one.You can make spells loop in on themselves, and add modifying runes like size or time onto various other runes to change their properties. I found myself spellcrafting constantly, not just to have fun and mess around but also to modify my setup for the present situation. By the end of the game, I utterly annihilated the final boss, which felt a bit cheap, but at the same time it was very satisfying seeing how powerful i had become through my creativity, which is kind of the point.Completed it to 100% in 22~ hours, and am left wanting more. Short and sweet, it was worth the money, and I'm proud to have supported the developers. As of this review, there are also only 5 negative reviews, and they are all chinese players disappointed by the chinese translation. So unless you're chinese, this game is 100% recommended by anyone who has played it :)"
76561198035338114,Recommended,529660,31937069,Posted: 24 May,all,SoM,"This is an incredible game solely based on its spellcrafting system.Sure, the writing and pacing might feel a bit drab; the UI isn't the smoothest thing to use; we're sorely missing a minimap/radar function; sometimes the spells don't fly the way you point and you might encounter a few bugs now and then, etc. etc.... None of these distract from the core experience of using magic in varied and creative ways.And it's so much fun.I've seen and played a few ""customize your own spells"" games, and this one simply takes the cake. The spellcrafting system is straightforward and very intuitive to learn. Puzzles strewn around the world are tailored to almost all the runes/effects you're going to find, and the hint system is great to let you know if you've already got the required tools (and somewhere along the path, you might have enough tools in your arsenal to solve them in unexpected ways - and it's going to feelgreat). The combat leaves enough room for you to win using vastly different setups, though enemies immune to multiple elements might make you feel frustrated at times.I'm currently around 30%~40% progress, and even if the later parts of the game don't maintain the level of quality as the part I've seen so far, it will still be super fun (there will be more magic to find and more spells to craft - that will never be not fun), and worth every penny of the full price.The devs seem to have plans to update the game for a while, so I'm looking forward to see the game improve in the near future.-------------(Below is a quick Chinese review for the game.)这个游戏的核心是“创作法术”，魔法系统非常直观易懂，不需要什么编程基础，非常好玩。在剧情、节奏、界面和操作方面，或许会有这样那样的瑕疵和不足，但这些小小缺点并不影响游戏最核心的体验。随着主角解锁和学习到越来越多的新魔法和新效果，这个尝试和探索不同的法术构成、组合不同的符文来解谜与打怪的过程会变得越发有趣，时不时都会让人有豁然开朗、非常过瘾的体验。初期的节奏可能会比较慢，但对于“自己设计/编程魔法”这个概念感兴趣的玩家，这个游戏绝对值得推荐。我关注过也玩过好几个有类似系统的游戏，可以说这款算得上是同类中的佼佼者，目前这个价格绝对不亏。界面和菜单的汉化不是很理想，但据说剧情的汉化没什么问题，应该不用担心。"

,Recommended,529660,33914798,Posted: 30 July,all,nodensmt,"Overall, the game is pretty great. Not phenomenal, but very good.Pros:1. Awesome spell system2. Interesting story (far more-so if you talk to NPCs regularly)3. There are fun side-quests/challenges4. Fun, yet simple, graphics style5. Music is reasonably good (never felt the need to turn it off)Cons:1. The spell system, being its greatest asset, is sadly not explained in detail very well. You'd never know detonate and overcharge are mutually exclusive, when more complex runes are affecting what they are connected to, or things as simple as how to read the mana requirement bar under the customizable spell name.2. The game ramps up far too slowly. If I could recommend anything to the developers, it would be to make a couple more augment and/or trigger runes accessible earlier on.3. Once you learn the system, the game isn't very difficult. The real difficulty is figuring out what I listed as a con under 1.Suggestions:Buy the game. Play the game. Enjoy the game. Then, go spend some time on the forums helping them make it and the sequel even better."

76561198030774954,Recommended,529660,32065340,Posted: 30 May,all,TheReadPanda,"One of the best new games I've played in a while. Definate thumbs up. Things to note: As of this writing you really should have a controller to play it right. They are working on better keyboard bindings and I am sure that in the future this will not be such an issue.While it might look like a simple platformer at first the spell grid sigil system is pretty neat, and there are fun puzzles, both to open areas in a grid like puzzle format and in figuring out how to best build spells to solve other puzzles.That combined with the over all story (which is a bit campy and tongue in cheek but cute) leads to a fun game.If I were to make any suggestions about the game I would say that each time you get a sigil it would be nice to see a little example, like a cut scene or one free example of a spell using it so that the player knows what it does more clearly. The tool tips are nice but sometimes it is not entirely clear what a function does and how best to place it in a grid to get the desired effect.Still, it is a great game and I encourage you to try it, at $25 (at the time of this writing) I found it actually a pretty good deal.The one other thing I'd like to see is a variant of this where you can play a necromancer with different spells and so on. I think that'd be pretty neat, or a DLC using the same world but a different approach. Really could expand the game if they are looking for a good way to add dlc or the like!"
,Recommended,529660,32847528,Posted: 27 June,all,MokiKisa,"Very fun zelda style game. reminds me of Windwaker. That's just how I think of it.Like the rest of the reviews on here, the magic system is really fun and flexible.I really love the art style."
76561198045288749,Recommended,529660,31845583,Posted: 19 May,all,Riiku25,"This game makes me feel conflicted.The music is enjoyable, and very fitting. It is, however, forgettable. Good nonetheless.The story is really boring and typical. Evil king, mages are persecuted, go save the world or something. The game ends on a needless cliffhanger, even though the game already feels a bit short on story content.Visually, the game is quite nice. It has the typical cel-shaded Unity game look without looking lazy or bad. It actually is kinda nice. The shadows look kind of bad in some spots, but the game look really good in general.The real point of the game, however, is to craft and cast spells. And this is the part of the game that makes me feel conflicted. There is a fair amount you can do with the spellcrafting system, and that is the part that I love. But the part that I don't like is that there is no real reason to actually come up with creative spells. In a weird way, the game falls flat in terms of both combat and puzzles, but it succeeds in the spellcasting system itself.So the combat fails for one main reason. The only thing that really matters in combat, besides blocking and dodging, is dealing tons of damage, and there isn't a lot of creative ways to do that. Sure, you can create a rotating image of yourself that shoots out homing projectiles, but why do that when you can create projectiles that shoot out projectiles that shoot out projectiles and so on? Pretty much every combat encounter in the game can be solved by creating these recursive spells that just annihilate everything until you run out of mana. Even the last boss was a joke, with every phase of the fight ending with a single press of the right mouse button. But in a way, the combat was kind of enjoyable. There was something fun about watching my spells destroy everything in the room and lagging out my game. Just seeing how much mayhem I could cause with a single spell was fun in a way. But it leaves me wishing that the spellcasting system was a bit better tuned and that the game found a better way to actually challenge my spellcrafting abilites.Puzzles kind of have the same problem. Pretty much every puzzle at first was solved by me dashing around and shooting projectiles in quick succession with some exceptions like logic puzzles involving creating statues of yourself and putting them on buttons. But the story puzzles never really challenged me in any meaningful way. I also went out to find all of the spell components to see if those puzzles were any better, but they were solved in mostly the same way, and the teleport component further trivializes the puzzles. In a way, it was kind of fun to solve the puzzles in an unintended way when the game tells me that I may not have the proper components to do so, but I really wish that they would make their puzzles actually require me to be creative.And that is the main issue I have with the game, and the reason why I can only recommend this game if you are really in love with the idea of creating spells. There is never really any reason to utilize all the different components. In my opinion, the game should have given you all of the elements and most of the components early, and then forced you to actually use these components in a creative way to actually progress through the game. But as is stands, you can beat the game without most of the components (quite easily, in fact), you unlock the elements in the last stretch of the game, and you can kill all the enemies by just creating spells that continue to just create themselves. The game feels like it has done the job of fleshing out the underlying mechanics, but not done the job of actually giving you a reason to use them. So I had fun with this game, but I was left a bit unsatisfied."
,Recommended,529660,31831930,Posted: 18 May,all,Crokoking,"Very nice and polished game. It has somewhat simple graphics but a nice story and good puzzles.The highlight is definitely the spell-construction. There are a 4 basic spell types and a ton of runes to modify them. The spells can even be chained together with specific runes. It's a very versatile and cool system.The game has a bit of a metroidvania vibe since you can get into more zones, the more runes you find. A lot of them are optional and hidden behind puzzles or challenges.The combat is a well made. There are even interesting boss-battles. One complaint here is that the quickselect menu to swtich out spells doesn't pause the game. Also there are occationally issues with getting the spells to aim at the right enemy.This game is developed with controller in mind and works really well with that.Overall a clear recommendation"

,Recommended,529660,32904719,Posted: 27 June,all,Suniver,"So overall I loved this game a lot. It was amazing to play. The only real problem I had is the story felt rushed, especially the last half. But it made up for it with a wonderful spell crafting system that allowed me to make some simply overpowered room-killing spells that would activate and run automatically. The magic system in this game is what I've been looking for in every game involving magic I've ever played. Consequently, this is the only game to ever get what I wanted pretty much right (I do kind of wish that multiples of the same rune could be applied to each spell, but that's pretty much my only complaint about the magic system).8/10 (would be 7/10 for the lackluster rushed story, but the magic system demands an entire point back and I shall oblige it)"
76561197976488713,Recommended,529660,31911574,Posted: 22 May,all,TazzieDevil,"I recommend the game – because I realise that most gamers either do have game pads or are comfortable with the WASD keys. It looks good and I wanted to know more about the world and its people even though I only played 15 minutes or so.    But for me it was time for a refund.I didn't notice any warning that you should use a controller to play the game.  The game looks great and I love the idea of the games spell system.  But there was no way to remap keys that I could find.  I don't use WASD keys to play game nor do I use gamepads.  I gave it a go on the WASD keys - and the game is engaging - but I just couldn't adapt to play and ended up walking off cliffs etc.So, it’s a thumbs up from me – but a warning to older gamers like myself or left handed players who like to reconfigure the keys."
,Not Recommended,529660,32830482,Posted: 26 June,all,Tecmag Diams,"Overall the game felt like it was a demo of a game. The story was lacking and this is my largest complaint. It creates more questions than it answers and it doesn't provide many answers. Ontop of that the few answers you do get you guessed from the start. You could guess how most of the game was going to go by the time the intro ended.The gameplay was great, but I feel the spell combinations didn't always feel meaningful. It didn't offer a lot of gameplay time and overall felt like I just played a game that was half finished when they ran out of will to finish it.The game had promise, but I feel like they really missed the bar."

The only beign that once you find one insane spell combo, you have very little reason to change it up after gaining the wand that negates spell resistances, Made a simple spell that quite literally 1 shotted every floor of the final area, and every stage of the final boss. Nerf storm please."
,Recommended,529660,31828552,Posted: 18 May,all,The Alkaizer,"A short yet packed adventure game that is reminiscent of Zelda in many ways. The game feels good as do the controls and the world is a joy to explore. It starts slow but after a short while you start to accumulate runes and are able to backtrack to previous locations and unlock content you couldn't before. The narrative will also take you through temples that exhibit a neat level design where you'll solve your way through puzzles, find optional content and fight simple yet interesting bosses.The magic system is the real treat here. The interaction between the Behavior, Augment and Trigger runes will stimulate you to find ways to solve the puzzle and honestly, I've solved a few in a way that was mine which I'm sure was not intended by the devs. I still have a temple and the ending of the game to go but I have also experienced the gameplay loop and it is a neat little game design that will take you into the adventure quickly, hold your hand through it and leave you with a memorable experience.Well worth it as there's not that many games coming out in this genre."
,Recommended,529660,31900927,Posted: 22 May,all,@ddNothing,"After 2 hours I must admit I'm quite hooked!The gameplay - at first a bit repetitive - is starting to sound promising as new Behaviors / Augments are unlocked: I really want to reach the point I will be able to craft complex spells.The interface for crafting / renaming spells and switching between different spells of a same category is well made and for the first time I feel like I can adapt my playstyle dynamically to different types of situations, which is pretty new and cool to me ^^The content seems there: I have already beaten 2 bosses, collected a few new spells, a few major collectibles there are still many places for me to explore.The music is nice too and totally fits with the action as well as with the more peaceful moments.The only things that I'm less fan is the storytelling: I'm not particularly amazed by the Mr Greenwood performance and the way characters talk to each others using barks isn't very statisfying to me.All in all I would recommend this game: it's solid in terms of gameplay and quite refreshing while featuring this kind of ""old-zelda"" flavour that touches my heart."
,Recommended,529660,31887030,Posted: 21 May,all,OpCode90,"A smart and delightful zelda-like adventure that feels like a polished and well crafted experience. Puzzle and area design are well thought out, and the spell-crafting system is both intuitive and deep, allowing you to craft your own experiences and solutions to puzzles. The game does a good job of introducing you to it, and then slowly creating more complex scenarios for you to solve. This in turn makes you a better spell-caster and allows for a more strategical approach to combat as you start fighting more difficult monsters.I'm 6 hours in and haven't completed half of the map. The game encourages exploration and experimentation, allowing for  you to return to previous location in order to unlock areas you may not have had access to with a more limited set of spell modifiers.All in all - so far - an absolutely delightful experience. I hope more users post reviews to help get this game some attention."

About as basic as it gets.Movement.Idk if it was just my controller, but the movement was slow and clunky af. It was incredibly annoying in the burning Hamlet scene, with all the traps.It could definitely use some fixes, but overall, I'd say it's a great experience.Side note: There is absolutely no ♥♥♥♥ing reason for the traps to take more than 10 seconds to free me. I lost 3/4s of my health bar just pressing A to get out of those stupid traps. I was defenseless against 2 guards and 2 bats. For the love of christ fix that."

,Recommended,529660,31894496,Posted: 21 May,all,Roanen,"I'm not going to be too detailed here. Not yet anyway, as I still want to finish the game.So let me just start by saying that I love this game, and nearly everything about it. Right from the start I was grabbed by it, not to say I'm a hard mark(I'm probably not) but to say that there is so much that I find captivating about it. The music is the first thing you get to experience and it is anything but lackluster, the puzzles made me stop and think(again, probably not that hard) and the world is beautiful.I wanted to mention this last because I think it is the most important aspect of this game; the spellcrafting. The spellcrafting is an extraordinary system imo as it allows you to tailor make spells for any situation and encourages exactly that through it's combat and puzzles. It has so much potential as a mechanic and I've ALWAYS played mages before other classes in games for their flashy magic. Let me just say that this did not at all disappoint me.Now for fairness sake I will say there are a few parts that fell a bit short; the story isn't 100% engaging(to where I am in the game), there isn't any (real) voice acting throughout the game(so for the most part I just did it myself XD), the characters aren't all too memorable, the enemies are a fair bit too predictable.This kind of gameplay makes me want to love everything about the game but I can't currently say I do, however these are small things in an indie like this and I would LOVE to see an expansion on this solid effort and beautiful piece of art.Just to end this off I would like to put a more in depth review of the things I loved and didn't but I'll leave that till the end. Either way, for anyone that loves to be creative, watch things blow up, or is just a fan of throwing fire; this game is worth your time."

76561197987033201,Recommended,529660,31891086,Posted: 21 May,all,PhoenixFury,"Great game. Storyline is relatively cliche but fun, while adding in a few elements I thought were reasonably unique. While there is quite a bit of backtracking, the gameplay is solid and some of the puzzles will leave you scratching your head for a few minutes trying to figure out which spells you need to design to optimally complete them. You can suboptimally complete them as well, but it will be more difficult and/or take several attempts. So far it hasn't given me any trouble.The real strength of this game is the spellcrafting system though. You start out with some basic spells which are fairly generic, and your first few runes start giving you very mundane things. (""Woo, firebolt. Oh, oh wait now it's *homing* firebolt."") Yet, after you get a bit through the game you start being able to combine and chain spells and add different modifiers and contigent triggers that your spells start getting very complex and incredibly fun to experiment with. This really makes the game unique, and aside from Magicka (which still didn't really have fully customizable spells), I can't think of anything that approaches it in that regard.8.5/10, Short and rough in places, but with unique mechanics. Very enjoyable."

,Recommended,529660,33359366,Posted: 7 July,all,jholl9,"I bought this game because the premise seemed neat, it looked cute, and the music was enchanting. It was on sale, and I got more than my money's worth.Where to start? There's a lot of good stuff. I'm not normally a fan of puzzles, but the puzzle mechanics in Mages aren't pushed in your face (Except in the final boss battle, in which it is done BEAUTIFULLY), and they're flexible. Don't have the prerequisite runes for a challenge? If they're behavior runes, maybe you can finagle ones you already have to work for it. Things aren't set in stone, and if you're creative enough, and lucky enough, you can get ahead of the game.That leads right into runes and spells. Like it says on the tin, you're a Mage. In most games that means you get a few spells that you can customize with a talent or two, making them slightly different. In Mages you have four ""behaviours"" of spells, each of which determines a lot about the spell - but not nearly everything. Immedi hits things in melee range, right when you use it. Igni creates an orb of its element. Creo creates a full elemental effect. And Ego creates a defensive effect based on its configuration and element.Runes change how your spells act, and they influence each other as much as your spells. For instance, to start with, Igni creates an immobile, hovering orb of its element (Fire, to start with) that simply sits in place. Not incredibly useful unless you time it right. Combine it with a Homing rune, and you have a mine that seeks out a target when it gets close. Combine those with Move, and you have an enemy-seeking fireball. However, runes have different effects based on the spell they're affecting. For instance, if you combine Ego with a Homing rune, it will pull enemies and objects towards you like a magnet. And then there's combining spells, and...I could go on for a hot minute. Point is, it's fun to see what you can do.The difficulty scales up pretty quickly, at least for me, which was interesting. It definitely puts pressure on you to stop messing around with funny spells and find ones that work at least reasonably well. Though that isn't to say your ""silly"" spells aren't useful. Sometimes what you REALLY need is that defunct ""bouncing betty"" spell you were trying to make work and just left in your spell list.As well, I've found that there is no one ""God spell"" or somesuch that will solve EVERY problem. Someone will be immune, or it won't target properly, or it uses too much mana, or something else I can't think of on the spot. Point is, you have to be flexible.The story is really great. Cute, without being too cheesy or being pointless. I constantly felt as if I had a set goal in mind, even during sidequests. Props.Probably the only real downside I've found is that the game is SHORT. Not abysmally so, but it's really not long. The story, at least. I've still got a good chunk of game left to explore right now.It also feels like it might be more intuitive to play it on a controller, but I also feel more comfortable on a keyboard. I don't think it has a real effect on my enjoyment of the game.I keep thinking that a good way to describe it might be like this: Legend of Zelda, without Link, and Zelda is the hero.Also: Read the Wanted signs."

Great soundtrack and comic style, fluid graphics. Controls are also on spot. I haven't played Magicka to which it is compared in some comments, so the spell crafting aspect is new to me - and I have to admit I like it.It's a bit zeldaesk but a tiny bit more casual I'd say. Plus it reminds me of Fable as far as the cheerful atmosphere is concerned. Still MoM surely has its own character and I'll definitely go on playing it.I've also started playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R again (which is one of my favourite three titles of all time) and this gem appears to be just the right counterweight to the dark eastern european despair:)So if you like to be drawn into a fairy-tale-world and/or experimenting with magic powers and enjoy neat puzzles: go for it.Actually there's no reason not to love this game."
,Recommended,529660,31949253,Posted: 25 May,all,Bomber Cube,"The spell crafting is the main event here. I didn't really like the visual style, it was pretty clean and the color palette was very appropriate for each area, but the models and animation really didn't work for me. This game rewards completionist and explorers while having a good pace about each area. 95% of the time the spells were intuitive, but the occasional hiccup wasn't a big problem. The music was solid enough that I wouldn't listen to other music on the side while playing, which is an accomplishment when it comes to soundtracks and sound design.TL;DR: I liked being able to express my creativity in spells and I love collecting things that are useful, which this game has plenty of. Despite the game's weaknesses those two features carried the whole enjoyment of the game for me and I had a great time.--- Somewhat spoilery from here on ---A problem I can't entirely blame on the developers is the dominant strategy gameplay and low difficulty. Considering how much freedom we have in spellcrafting it would be hard to balance the game if certain players never found or experimented with the right spells to be strong enough to fight the bosses. I think they were undertuned for this reason, but its a bit too low. They made a good move with the 4 spell types so it avoids some of the ""make the best spell then never change it"" style gameplay, but doesn't really fix it.The last section of the story is the weakest when it comes to pacing. You've finally acquired all the main elements for spellcrafting, then you go through a simple gauntlet to the boss and its over. The element of your birthright as Zia is the last and most unused element just because it's last.The balance of puzzle to combat is just about perfect. Each has some problems though:The puzzles that aren't ""drag circles with arrows"" puzzles, the kind that are in the world are the best ones. They're only interesting early on when you have limited spells and need to use some creativity. My favorite was using the Shield spell with the homing modifier to pull items towards you. Pulling an explosive barrel into a destroyable wall was the most ""I think I figured this out earlier than I needed to"" moment I had, which was great experience. Most of the rest are simple or a little too precise to not have brute force be easiest solution.Combat almost works, but I feel like kiting gameplay gets old after a while. Being chased by multiple enemies seems to class with spell casting. There are four reinforced combat dynamics:1-Shoot your best spell before it can touch you.2-Run, turn around, shoot fast spell, turn again and run untill you have distance.3-Run, cast an area of effect spell, keep runing.4-Attach a reversed strong spell to the dash and just dash in straight lines.(5-Change element of any of the above if they're resistant)usually fails and leads to 2,is 90% of the game,is boring and weak,s very effective but too repetetive to not be boring.2 has an alternate where you drop stone copies of yourself to draw aggro and shoot whoever is tricked, but it really is just the same. Run, shoot, run, shoot. Its engaging because it will kill you if you don't keep running and shooting, but its not that deep.There is little precision and little thinking when it comes to most enemies. The interesting ones are the shaman ones who capture and reflect spells and the scorpions that have an armored carapace that can be broken with explosives. They get subverted when you get enough magic to spam spells, but untill then they're pretty interesting. I may be forgetting one or two other interesting ones but most are just [charge straight at the player unless staggered].This game could use some more puzzle bosses. The chess crypt boss was really close to being very solid, the floor mechanic just missed the mark a little. The big tree was just ok, it needed to be simple since it was an early boss. The twin slimes was just ok too, but gets points in making you decide who to attack in the boss itself. The ice salamander was mostly a waiting game.I'm not much of a story structure-literate person, so I won't comment on it, someone else probably will say what I could much better. I liked the voice blurbs, but I'd like if there could be more of them so it didn't sound like it repeated so often.To summarize and mention some other things:Great magic system with questionable balancesolid musicone good boss and two good enemiesmagic casting clashes with the enemies in the gamemeaniful collectables that approach a metroidvaniaclassic but overused elemental areas like ice, fire, and forest, the crypt and mine were a nice change of pace and had good puzzlesI liked Zia as a character, but the overall character art style wasn't my cup of tea. Maybe it's a cultural difference, or maybe I'm too used tomuh japanese anime styleI don't think I'd replay the game, but my playthrough was a great time and it was very worth the price and time."

Plenty of exploration and puzzles which involve the spell programming mechanic, as well as the door puzzles were well planned and cleverly designed.And just recently, the dev team has introduced the archmage update which gives players old and new an extra challenge, as well as a reason to program those wonderful spells.The art design and sound direction are wonderful and the storyline is well thought out -- and it all comes together to make a game that is worth your money, and then some.

Hoping for an expansion. 8/10.-----Like other people are saying, the spell creation is awesome. It's simple to understand with lots of combinations and different modifiers.I really enjoyed the game, and it's a nice thing that all the challenges/quests are solveable the whole game through. No risk of missing anything.Graphics are really saturated and cute, kind of cartoonish that works really well. Background audio is fitting for the environments. Sound effects are good and delivers the right atmosphere.The UI is clean and the menu system is simple and easy. No issues at all.Personally I had no bugs or error except for one tiny thing - when I got struck by an enemy the camera stopped following me for a short time. But when I ran out of picture and back again it snapped right back to me. No biggie and it only happened once.The game offers some interesting challenges, but I wish there was an option for a harder difficulty setting. I completed the game without ever dying. Which doesn't have to be a bad thing, of course.To me the hardest part of the game was _finding_ all the extra stuff. A lot of running around and checking every corner.The game recommends playing with a controller when you start it, and I totally agree. This game could probably be played with KB/M, but with the controller everything just feels right. I think it would be pretty hard keeping all the spells intuitive on the keyboard.If you're looking for a cozy adventure game with magic and puzzles, you have it right here. €20 is a good pricing and I feel it was worth it."

You will spend a lot of time tinkering with the spell system to come up with some crazy spells.It also makes the optional content more enticing since you could get more ways to alter your spells. The game also makes use of interesting puzzles that will involve modifying your spells to achieve the objective. Thankfully, the game will indicate if you have the right runes in each puzzle so you dont need to tear your hair out trying to find a solution you dont have yet.Controls are tight. You will be swapping through spells in the heat of combat with no problem, which is a good thing since the game keeps introducing new factors to prevent you from spamming the same couple of spells.

,Recommended,529660,32604585,Posted: 20 June,all,Giftshop,"Edit: I've reached 92% completion now so I feel fairly confident in expanding on a few things I was on the fence about earlier.Mages of Mystralia is budget Zelda with a splash of Magicka. Unfortunately some incredibly uncreative writing, limited scope and a lack of polish in key areas will probably stop MoM ever getting recognition it deserves.Mouse and keyboard are good despite the suggestion to use a controller, at no point did I feel the need to switch.Combat is the biggest thing holding MoM back. In a better game studious use of dash and shield, mana management and the right spell use would be key to overcoming the game's most difficult challenges. The reality is once you settle on a specific combination you'll probably continue to use that with only minor tweaks as you unlock more modifiers.There are a couple of enemies that will give you pause the first time you encounter them but they both have very exploitable weaknesses.Combat strategy isn't much deeper than 'unload your most powerful spell and run around so you don't get stunlocked to death.' Mana regen is slow, and even approaching the end game a full pool isn't enough to take out more than 2 or 3 weaker enemies at once. The toughest enemy in the game can take close to a minute to take down, however due it's slow movement speed and low damage it's a not threat compared to several weaker enemies which will ensure that once you're knocked down you're not getting back up.Spellcrafting and the process of collecting more modifiers for your spells is the game's best aspect, however many of the modifiers are either useless or mandatory and some completely invalidate others. If you're wondering how many spells you actually have it's basically area blast, area explosion, projectile, area damage over time, dash, shield, clone. Some of which can be set to trigger into others. They vary for each element (fire, lightning, ice, earth) but very rarely in a way that will mean you'll have to reconsider how you'll use it.Puzzle elements are consistently rewarding but mostly pretty simple, fortunately the game respects the player's intelligence enough to not feed them the answer before they've even begun.Environmental design is consistently good if a little bland, level design is almost flawless.Story has a couple of mildly interesting points stuck in the sort of plot a computer could spit out (the goblins grow bolder, quaint village is razed, go collect the things and fight the guy, roll credits). The game has no shortage of characters, none of which are memorable. Even your mad, talking spellbook who will occasionally comment on environmental objects just fades into the whitenoise of the rest of the game. There's even an optional 'scene' in which you revisit the house of your mentor, you can read his diary and find out why he trained you, poignant music plays in the background. No one's gives a ♥♥♥♥ about this guy, he must have less than 50 lines of dialogue in the entire game and he does nothing interesting or memorable whatsoever.10/10 it's okay"

The fact that you can't change the key bindings is just one thing. That in itself wouldn't be too much of a tragedy.But later when you have to switch quickly between spells, it just becomes really awkward because you have to cycle through them and keep pressin a number key just exactly as many times an fast enough before the little un-intuitive ""quick menu"" disappears.But the worst thing is the actual controlling of the character. Sometimes she just seem to go in random directions. I just got stuck to a wall and no matter which keys I press she just kept running into the wall.This is a HUGE downside, because a lot of the puzzles are time-based platforming. So you have to quickly and precisely get from one point to an other. Nigh impossibel and very frustrating.Right now I can't recommend this game. Maybe they will fix these in a patch later."

It never wore out it's welcome and I'll be looking forward to any sequels or expansions.The lore is surprisingly deep as well, and the story, while not particularly surprising in how it plays out, it solid and engaging. Doesn't feel like a D&D clone or a rip off of any other lore.All around, I can't recommend it enough!"

(Probably best played with a controller)The story of the female protagonist is easy to follow and does not require vast amounts of reading which is ideal for younger gamers and casual gamers a like.Graphics are both appealing and soft on the eyes allowing for easy to follow paths and directions so that getting lost is not a problem.Spell 'Creation' while being the most complex part of the game is presented in an easy to follow and understand method.A short if not Ideal game for children and casual gamers.

I'm not a console player, and I don't have a controller lying around, and I found that with a mouse and keyboard this game is basically unplayable.For an action-y game, with precise controls required, the lazy-console-port which resulted in mapping the movement pad straight to WASD (meaning that you only have 8 direction of motion) certainly has a lot of non-8-direction movements required.It's poorly thought out, poorly implemented and unintuitive. Simply implementing the standard top-down-shooter mechanics of W=towards mouse, S=away from mouse and A/D=strafe would've been a significant improvement. This is not complex or ground-breaking stuff. It's a rookie mistake by a rookie developer and it kills what could've been an awesome game.[edit]I have uninstalled the game and requested a refund. If the devs ever get around to implementing a decent control scheme, however, I will certainly reconsider this game because it looks great. It's just unplayable.[/edit]"

I am adding mine as a negative.  BECAUSE I DID NOT ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I WANTED TO.  I also want to see if it shows up.  I recommeng the purchase for people who have tastes between casual and light experience as a game.  More experienced gamers play everything.  :)I loved the art, but did not like the character.  I had no issue with her, but I have no affinity for Zia.  I have no issue playing  female.  I just don't care for her.  I have no reason to care about anyone in this story.  The city had one good thing, a reference to Terry Pratchett.  *Salute*Other than that everything in the world felt telegraphed.  It was too easy - and it had to be because of how linear it is.The game mechanic is a great step - but incomplete.  I would love to see this grown into a real experience, but for now, there is little more to this than an easy beat-em-up....  with the same areas over and over with more difficult, but not really hard, enemies that scale to your new spells.  Frankly, at that point - this is a one time playthrough that has no pay-off.  Mods will save this, but what is here feels like a game that needs mods, which seems like it is flexible, but actually has less freedom and is somehow more linear than Torchlight.  I keep looking to hope this is just early access.The spell crafting is neat, but needs more sophistication and maybe some actual context.  It is not *endless* by any means.  No object animation, no combining elements to fuse hybrids...  Also, Regio would be a better name for Actus, and Muto would be a better one for Ego.  Also, what Mage doesn't have conjuration???  The magick is light programming logic with limited effective combinations - to solve puzzles.   The rest is beat em up with magic....  with infinite respawning enemies in areas that are small in size and hedged in.As for spell crafting - Two Words 2 is ABSOLUTELY MORE FLEXIBLE.The story is dialed in.  I love Ed Greenwood.  I really enjoyed the world of Faerun for decades.  It does not even fit the atmosphere.  It certainly does not hit like Spellfire, but it has glimmers of it...  The music is lovely, but doesn't shine.  Good background.  As a game, this would likely be a much more fun experience for an inexperienced or casual gamer.The art is superb and I wanted to enjoy this more than I did.  I might finish it in my spare time, but until then it is in my play of played too much to refund but don't care how it ends.  Also, i want it to do well enough someone uses what is in this game to make a game I DO enjoy."

Play through this boring mess and youll soon find it doesnt deliver any freedom promised or quality youd except from a passion project game. A quick search on the steam forums bug reporting page has a ton of posts about game breaking bugs that devs should have fixed long ago. One in particular blocks you from ever accessing the spells menu because if you do you will be locked there due to the escape key breaking whether you are using controller or keyboard. My entire save is now worthless due to♥♥♥♥♥♥poor coders that no one would hire for understandably good reason.The game itself is so easy that even a 5 year old will get bored of the cliched puzzles and terrible mob AI with predictable boring boss fights.

,Recommended,529660,32000638,Posted: 27 May,all,NOPper,"It takes a bit to really get started, but the magic system in this Zelda-like adventure game is a puzzle in itself. Once you have a few runes to experiment with it's really satisfying to find spell combos to solve specific challenges. Having to make the runes all fit with certain criteria keeps it a puzzle without feeling like you're too restricted.You can have multiple custom spells memorized for each slot, so having a full utility belt is easy to do. The only complaint I have so far is the spell hotkey system's controls. You have 1-4 on the keyboard set for spell slots, and tap the keys repeatedly to cycle each slot's spell. The issue is the first press doesn't change the selected spell out. This wouldn't be a problem if it was selecting a slot on the first press ro something, but each slot is already bound to different cast keypresses (left/right click, space, shift-click) so there's no need to select. And if you dont press the same key again fast enough the spell selection times out. This is a real pain in something like the boss battles where you can suddenly be swarmed by smaller enemies and want to♥♥♥♥♥♥to a more efficient spell.Other then that, this is a great game!"

76561198043392766,Recommended,529660,32190569,Posted: 4 June,all,[X] +Medic,"Magicka mixed with Link to the Past!The very easy to use spell crafting system has a surprising amount of depth. It's similar to Magicka in that there are some base spell types that are cast with different buttons. Instead of creating ""combos"" like in Magicka, you build the spells using modifiers that you unlock as you progress through the game. For example: start with creating a flame that hovers in place; attach the  'move' modifier to create a fireball type spell, then link detonate to it to create an exploding fireball. After 10 hours in I've created about 8-10 completely different spells.PROS: fun spell creation, great sense of progression, pretty good puzzlesCONS: the writing isn't that great"

A gigantic possibility of builds makes the ''Become a spellmaster'' headline much more meaningful, you actually have to learn a lot of combinations to unlock the full potential of your spells. I'm looking forward to a multiplayer version (Co-op missions or something) that could be a really cool feature added to the game. I would also love to see a DLC with new areas, puzzles and monsters to fight."
