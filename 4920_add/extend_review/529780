It's hand drawn graphics are wonderfully, inserted adding much to the game as a whole. All in allI believe that Disturbed is a good game and should be given a shot. After all it's free :P"

76561198129936651,Recommended,529780,32574544,Posted: 19 June,all,kokiri1232,"Disturbed is great old school choose your own adventure game. It has as a great creepy atmosphere, and good art. Some of the deaths you can get here can be funny or vary scary, mostly scary. Now this game does not have a lot of sound, witch I would have liked, to have more of and one or two puzzles, can be a bit tricky but nothing too hard. And it can be/feel a little short, but its ok so all in all disturbed is a great scary little game. And witch I cannot wait to get/play the upcoming sequel too it. So if you want to get a good scary choose your own adventure game, this game is for you."

I can see that somebody put a lot of work into it, and its an okay story. If you want to play out a good horror story, this might be for you. But I did not really enjoy it."

Some of the deathsq feel cheap, but I alwasy felt like I wanted to replay and definetly get the 100% completion. Felt good getting all the achievments :)"
,Recommended,529780,29550964,Posted: 28 January,all,Money Maker Mike,1 and a half hour of fun. Story is pretty simple but I like the concept. Artwork and the little sound effects succeed in making the game emmersive creating an atmosphere. I enjoyed my time would recommend

76561198178617063,Recommended,529780,29620724,Posted: 31 January,all,SamPs2,This is absulotly my kind of visual novel. the puzzles were a bit too simple but I didn't mind it. I think it's fun and worth a try.
76561198265316746,Recommended,529780,29693310,Posted: 4 February,all,Eight Unicorns,"This game is straightforward in it's play style. I didn't think I'd like the multiple choice options but I found it's actually really good. The atmosphere is very good in this game, the drawings really give it a unique feel. Being killed a lot is both frustrating and challenging, I've died plenty of times but it just makes me want to play more. I'll have to admit there are a lot of moments of ""I know I'm probably going to die if I do this but..."" because curiosity got the better of me. I've really enjoyed this game and I would definitely recommend it to people who like puzzles and those old fashioned 'type the action into the command box' game."
