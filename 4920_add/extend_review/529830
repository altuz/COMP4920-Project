Nothing new, nothing to brag about. Dev broke promise to add MV capability to GCH and instead make this one to grind more money off his customers whom trusted him."

76561198115847622,Not Recommended,529830,28417937,"Posted: 16 December, 2016",all,Shad2225,"After more than 20 hours here I decided to post this review, been honest on this software so for those that are having doubts on buying this software and want to know the difference between this and the old version of GCH I didn't find anything new for the user to make , this one felt like the old version only with some new icons and the user interface changed , but the tools here are the same as the old version only now its compatible with mac .One of the main problem I had with this from start was that this was promised as an update like many people here mentioned including me and the developers are to blame on that even if they apologize in my opinion a promise is a promise and one of the things that got me thinking that also the publisher Degica are also to blame on the problem since they offered to the ones that bought this from day one some credit but I believe since they are the publishers on the rpg maker mv they knew that this was suppose to be an update to the old version and they agreed to charge an extra product with the developers and thats what i think it happened with this software.The software is not bad to make your sprites and it can be very useful too but, this still lack of new features because it only has RPG Maker MV sprite support (and you must have the software to use them too keep in mind that) and this software can be better use for other engines as well but since its only focusing on the rpg maker series this will take its potencial away instead on making it a great sprite maker for any engine and that could be better features for this software and since it been weeks I only seen one update and that update made the software not to run anymore and I can't use it also there are no information on this update on what it change or anything , and I can't recommend this software in the current state since this feels like the old software and doesn't  have any new tools to work with.So in concussion I hope this software gets new features soon , so I can say that its different from the old one and to the developers not to lie on promises they can't keep if you promise something make sure to fulfill it , and I know that every one need to make money that one of the important stuff on why we work hard ,also I hope that the company that published the software also keep in mind on what they are doing since they are also responsible for this stuff too and lately I been having bad experience with them very recently."
,Not Recommended,529830,29071442,Posted: 6 January,all,Z,"Very disappointing. One of my worst experiences on Steam thus far. This really provides nothing new to the original Game Character Hub besides the MV ""support,"" which is actually just a rip of the RPG Maker MV Character Generator (literally nothing new added). If you already own RPG Maker MV, then there's no reason why you'd need this. If you own the original Game Character Hub, then there's no reason you'd need this either.Additionally, I emailed their support on 3 different occasions asking for the 50% off due to having purchased the original Game Character Hub and their offer for the discount. This entire thing should've just been a new add-on to the original software. There's nothing new added here that RPG Maker MV's Character Generator wouldn't already provide."

I use it extensively to make characters for my game (with RPG Maker MV).Its character generator is highly customizable. You can parametrize what kind of character you want to generate (gender, race, warrior or not). You define your own parameters if you need: you can define which layers can be used (or not) for the character generation depending on the chosen parameters.I don't know if I am clear, but it's the most powerful character generator I have seen so far. I can generate dozens of high-quality characters, with my own set of parameters in a few clicks.Like in MV, every part of the character is generated (walk, face, damage, battle) and is ready to use in your game!I recommand it!"

I am not charging for my game. It is completely for fans, and I would spend $40 or even $50 for this program because it helps me build my dream. It helps me tremendously. I love the software. It's easy to use, it uses layers (layers are amazing for spritework!), and it's just overall simple. I cannot draw whatsoever. BUT I have made many characters with this software and the with the previous software, and dare I say it looks like I know what I'm doing. My sprites look professional, and I cannot thank the developer(s) enough for finishing this software regardless. Guys, if you want to make RPG Maker games, and you want some sprite editing software that's easy and enjoyable, use this. Use Game Character Hub: Portfolio Edition."

GCH for RMMV is finnaly out! I'm going to make A LOT of awesome characters like never before!"" and then...Well...All parts are just same like in RPG Maker MV generator. There in only few differences:- You can edit parts in-generator.- You have more color options.- You have more layering power.- There's an animation preview.That's all, I guess?But hey! You can import own parts! That's the thing i needed all the time! :DI saw some additional parts in RPG Maker MV Season Pass DLC so you can copy and paste them into generator if you want to get more parts.Still, no extra parts hurts me....but thank you for this awesome app! ^^EDIT: I am waiting for updates, there is no way of converting multiple images into one part for every character style (Face, Walk, Battler, Damage), so adding own parts is a bit messy for me. In normal GCH there is that option but GCH doesn't support RPG Maker MV  (which I personally use) parts like Portfolio Edition....So I am just waiting for that update to make my library bigger! :D"

Once we get used to the interface, it becomes very useful to create characters for RPG Maker MV (supports also XP and VX). It's more powerful than the base generator as it offers more options: you can draw, erase parts of the character, recolor, rescale, etc... It's a good companion along RPG Maker; I use it a lot for my game!"
76561198382293866,Recommended,529830,31511041,Posted: 2 May,all,linceres86,"I was a little lost at first, but the tutorial helped get started. This software is full of capabilities, it supplies a large library of generator parts, which you can pick from to assemble your character.But I was more interested in using my own custom parts for my own game that do not use any RPG Maker engine. I was glad to see that this program can adapt to any sprite format you need:- You can create a new blank document with as many views as you want (for instance, walk, run, fight, etc...), and where each view has its own frame layout.- You can define animations for your custom character format that can be played in the animation player. Animations are playedwhileyou are editing your character, which greatly helps get a preview of your work.- Most importantly, you can import your own generator parts in it. You can proceed in two ways: either by the user interface (which I did), either through some external tool.- Once your generator parts are added, they appear in the program item library along with the items that are supplied by default. You can then use your generator parts to create your characters. The program also provides some post-processing tools: you can recolor, resize, draw some parts of your character (like its hair, eyes, cloth). The pixel selection tool allows to be really precise.- And last but not least: you can define your own random character generator! You start by defining parameters, and then you define which of your generator parts should be spawn and assembled into a character depending on the previously defined parameters. It may seem confusing but it's not. Once the generator is configured, I can randomly generate dozens of female, male, or soldier characters in a single click! I simply set the right values to the parameters that I defined, and click on Generate and voilà!Conclusion: This program is a very nice character generator. If you take time to learn how to use it, it can be easily used with custom graphic assets, and not only for RPG Maker engine games."

I can use it on RPG Maker Web Store. Ok They did it.Developper of GCH, not. I can't trust on the future of this software. I can't trust on next announcements from this developper.But i can trust Degica.Conclusion : read Announcements from degica. Don't read others...Ok... Why i don't have positive rating here ? because this version of the software is not really finished.GCH (previous version) do the same except for battlers... The other advantage to buy that, is the portfolio function. All files (sv battler, face, ...etc...) are saved in one file. The organization is easier... But... MV Support is a joke. Example : you can merge XP tileset... but you cannont merge MV Tileset..."

76561198381345399,Recommended,529830,31400535,Posted: 27 April,all,whoween21,"I am really satisfied with this product. It works well along with RPG Maker, and it speeds up my game making capacities :)1. This program allows you to assemble various parts of characters (picked from a library, that contains many character parts from RPG Maker XP, VX and MV) into a custom one. The program provides a layer system: each character part that is added to your character is added as a layer.Layers can be recolored, repositioned, resized, hidden, drawn over with pen/eraser/bucket, etc... This allows to post-edit each character part quickly.2. The program also comes with a random character generator. With that, you can generate any amount of characters in one click. The characters that are generated look surprisingly good for the most part. Note that you can also tune each character generator with some parameters (gender, race, armor, etc) so you can generate only what you need.It's a good purchase! It's a perfect mix with an easy-to-use art program likePaint.Netand MV character generator!"

So i swallowed the salt and I can recommend this program as a version of GCH that ascended to god status.Ps: don't listen to other salty people, it's a very good software, well worth the investment"
76561198382816898,Recommended,529830,31425269,Posted: 28 April,all,beiriver82,"Thumbs up for this program. It's a good character generator:- It is faster than RPG Maker MV character generator because it offers an option to any amount of characters in one click (for instance, you can ask the program to generate 200 random white elf female MV characters, and it will generate each sprite for the 200 characters in the folder you want).- It is also more flexible than MV generator: you can build your character manually part by part, by picking character parts from the ""library"". Each part is added as a layer which can edit as you please (recolor, resize, rotate, draw over it, add noise, change opacity, blending options, etc...). It adds more versitality to the characters we can make!Once the work is done, it's easy to import the character to MV: the program exports each sprite into its own PNG file. It's then easy to move them into your MV project folder."
