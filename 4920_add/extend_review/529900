You guys should really add an endless mode and maybe more levels. Though for its price it makes sense. All in all its agreatgame. I really recommend this game."

The mouse works really well, you can wave your ship around the screen with better speed and accuracy than a controller would allow, using mouse wheel to switch weapons. The gameplay becomes challenging very soon, there are swarms of enemy ships and bullets all over the screen and you have to try to dodge between the bullets while maximising your own firepower.It's a lot of fun, looks fabulous and excellent value. It's one you'll want to play rather than idle for cards :)"

76561198261895606,Recommended,529900,34168282,Posted: 11 August,all,Helios,"It's a short arcade game. For its price, it's quite fun and not too challenging. The only flaw was every ship was pink in my gameplay but I realized it's much more colouful in the trailers. Anyway, it was a good, relaxing 2 hours. I'd recommend playing with your own music."
76561198351895530,Recommended,529900,30367597,Posted: 6 March,all,mmmmmpiracy,"Running on Linux, with the radeonsi driver.Both of my xinput controllers didn't work at all in this game, and the controller/resolution configuration menu that starts before the game had approximately 40 entries for ""Cancel"", all mapped identically. This configuration menu actually detected both of my controllers, but they were completely useless in-game, so I was forced to use the mouse.Gameplay with the mouse wasn't honestly bad. I was surprised. it ended up like a mashup of SNES Mario Paint's ""Fly Swatter"" game, along with Space Invaders and hints of Galaxian thrown in.There are graphical issues. All the models are pink until they explode in to pretty little triangles, then they look like they're supposed to. I'm not sure if this is different in other drivers, but on radeonsi, every enemy (and your ship) are just pink shapes.The game has a REALLY uneven difficulty curve. First level is a cakewalk for even the most inexperienced gamer. Second level is noticeably more difficult, and level three is impossible if you don't have the right upgrades. it keeps getting harder after that, to the point that I wondered aloud how someone would actually be able to play this game well with a gamepad; it'd be End-of-Ikaruga hard by Level 4.All of the above stated, it was less than a dollar when I bought it. How can I not recommend it? I've received less entertainment giving street performers/buskers $2 coins than I have from this game so far. I'll likely play it a lot, even with the glaring problems. I just wish it didn't have the problems."
76561198118866497,Recommended,529900,29555967,Posted: 28 January,all,JustTerex,"I love it. This is an amazing looking take on the space shooter genre created by Galaga. The graphics are amazing, the music sounds epic, and the final boss fight is one of the most fun levels of any game. This game is defenitely worth a dollar, and does not take the most skilled player in the world to beat (that doesn't mean it's easy though). There are many fun features I could talk about, but I think ist's better to just try it."
,Not Recommended,529900,30375910,Posted: 7 March,all,rotterdxm,"So, tried this game because it was on sale, so I picked it up on a whim. I have to say it does not look as polished as other ""geometry shooters"". The gameplay itself is a throwback to 1990s DOS euro-shmups games more than any hardcore Japanese-style ""bullet hell"". The hitbox is quite large, the progression very slow. I cannot recommend this game, having played dozens upon dozens of arcade and console shmups."

I would like to make it clear that if you are looking for hardcore difficulty stuff, you need to look elsewhere. This game is purely for the casual gamers."

,Recommended,529900,32641843,Posted: 22 June,all,Helevorn,"It's a very very classic, old-school shooter arcade-like, but very enjoyable, 4 different weapons and some customization! :)15 levels overall.I got some issues with the achievements though, they only unlocked after I closed the game the last time I played it, but in the end I got them all (even if on Steam it says that I unlocked them all in the same minute ahahah).Worth some playing :)"

,Not Recommended,529900,34606893,Posted: 30 August,all,Cdr Knob Cat,There's just not enough to this game.ProsGood graphics with an interesting aesthetic.Good controls are good.Decent gameplay mechanics.It's cheap.ConsDull and largely unchallenging gameplay with no depth.No replay value - the achievements can be obtained by finishing the game once.Very short (I finished it in a single game of 51 minutes).There are better top-down shooters around. Even at its low price I can't say it's worth the time.

And I'm talking about an original wired X360 game controller."
,Recommended,529900,32343921,Posted: 11 June,all,Raden,"""Whine whine my controller doesn't work"" ♥♥♥♥♥ it doesn't say it has controller support so stop complaining. Besides, this is a ""bullet hell lite"" type of game (it's not as intense as a bullet hell game but things can get pretty dicey in places.) All you need is a mouse to play this game. You will need to make fast movements. You will need to make slight, miniscule movements. A controller is a ham-fisted approach to this and will not work. You need the mouse to get anywhere in this game. Mouse controls movement (your ship moves like a mouse cursor, which is why it's so important) left mouse button fires, scrol wheel chooses weapons, right mouse button is shield. That's your control setup, it doesn't get any easier.You shoot down the enemies to earn a score, then you spend it on weapon and shield upgrades. If you don't suck, you can finish the game in an hour, but it is a pretty fun hour. I have no reason to replay it, nothing to earn (there's five achievements and four you get from just killing the bosses normally) but I'm going to be going back to it for sure jusat because it is fun.The game was $1.09 CAD. There's no point at all not buying it, even if it does only get played for an hour. A dollar for an hour of entertainment is generally a good deal."
