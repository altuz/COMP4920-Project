,Recommended,529950,32226296,Posted: 6 June,all,Above | Aluna,Fun game to play but you need to play it with friends. This game is a high reaction party game where you need to hit some balls. I would like to see a (online) Multiplayer mode instead of the multiplayer mode where you can play with up to 12 friends at one keyboard.Pros:+ Fun party game+ Multiple game modes+ Minimalistic design but a good working game+ Fun to play with friendsCons:- Quite repetitive- Single player is not fun after a while- pretty hard game to play (even though you only press one button)- No online multiplayer5.5/10 Fun little game but only when you play it with friends. Single player mode gets quite repetitive after a couple of tries. Quite a cool idea but just to small for a full game. Good thing is that there are three different types of gamemodes which are pretty fun! I bought this game for €0.49 cents but I wouldn't recommend it to buy at its full price.For more reviews check out myWebsite!

I have been playing it on my 10"" Intel Atom based tablet and the game has run flawlessly even when tested with 12 players (all me during testing) without any visible dipping in performance.PRO'S• The multitouch works great and the way the game handles assigning controls is really fantastic, it puts 12 tiles around the screen and players can tap whichever is closest to them to play. Since it is a single button game players just need to tap the edge of the screen in their area while playing. The game can be paused by tapping the centre of the screen.• On physical hardware controllers you can press any key on your keyboard and that will be assigned to a player, press it again to unassign it. Once again a very intuitive system.• The menu animations are also very very slick and make the game really easy to navigate.• The different gameplay modes are very easy to understand. This means there is a very low barrier for entry allowing anyone to play• However the game modes are also hard to master which makes them fantastic for competitive play.• Very low price. Goes without saying that the price is very very good, especially since it is a local multiplayer game meaning you only need to buy 1 copy to be able to play with many people.CON'S• The menu music is very repetitive, however you can turn it all off which is more ideal for playing with friends.• When the game is paused there is a 3...2...1... countdown timer when resuming, it takes far too long in my opinion. Half the time would still give everyone adequate time to get ready and in place.• Maybe it would also be nice to have an option to double the menu animation speeds. They are very nice but I find myself waiting for the animations to complete.• When using keyboard it would be nice if player colours were mapped to the screen based upon their location on a keyboard. This makes no effect to gameplay since the colours are only there for touch screen controls but it would have been a neat effect.• It would maybe be nice to slide my finger over the options in the settings menu rather than having to tap the arrows to adjust volumes. Not a big deal at all though since it is set and forget.• No online multiplayer, it would be neat to have. Its also a ballache to implement well so I can understand why it isn't here.So I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a simple fun local multiplayer game. It may seem like I have listed a lot of negatives but they are all very very minor things that have little effect on the gameplay."

It's very simple, easy to learn and you'll have plenty of tense moments where everyone will be on the edge of their seats and not just because they can't reach your keyboard.There are a couple different game modes you can play so it doesn't get boring too quickly and the practice mode means you can still play even if you don't have friends or family. However, I would not recommend buying the game if you are friendless or you're an orphan like Batman.The downside is that it's very easy to get bored but the price point means you're not taking a huge risk by deciding to buy the game and you won't feel ripped off if you stop playing after a few hours. You will however feel guilty that you've added another game to your never ending Steam library.To sum it up this game is fun without frustration, like Mario Party but you don't end up punching your nan because she stole your star.I'd rate it 9 awkward family gatherings out of 12"

I was able to have 6 people fully invested in this, and it made for an awesome experience. It beats most other party games with its simplicity, as in no one in our group won a match twice in a row. We had an eight year old beat our group of mostly 16 year olds. No other party came has such little learning curve, not even the ""king"" of party games, Mario Party. This game is now undoubtably a staple for whenever I have people come over, as everyone has an equal shot at winning, therefore no one feels disadvantaged.Thanks for this game Roman!"

,Recommended,529950,34630561,Posted: 31 August,all,Optineer,"TL;DR: Awesome party game if you have many friends.At first, I thought this game was boring playing single- and two-player games. After playing a 7-player game now I know that this game gets much better with more people playing. We all enjoyed it even though the input lag was terrible on the projector we used (not a problem with the game). I will recommend using more than one keyboard when playing a 4+ player game. Setting up a game with many players is fast and anyone can participate because the game is so simple."

You basically play with several people on the same computer, each person picks a key, and it becomes their control (you only need 1 button to control your orb). You spawn in as a certain color orb, and some ambient orbs spawn in at times, and are white. If you touch a white orb, it turns your color and kills other people who touch it. There are a few different gamemodes for this but they all have a similar principle. Good value for the dollar I paid for it, can play for maybe an hour at a time with several people to keep playing with."

It's minimalistic with a grerat soundtrack, you can develop strategies and discover new tactics. The map diversity takes it to another level, each map will require different skills, timings, good approximation and coordinance.Should I go on, or you've already purchased the game? The game modes make it more fun! I'm not sure if you can ever get bored of this game, you'll always want to give it a few rounds, check a new map on a game mode. Only after a few minutes you can see the progeress and it makes you wanna play for hours! If you don't have friends you can play in Practice, still lot of fun and you've always got a record to beat!Dude, really? Still not in your Library? It's only $1.59! What are you waiting for?! I belive if we support the developers then they might extend this game to online multiplayer, which will make it an absolute gem! Diamond. Perfection.The amount of fun compared to this price is basically a robery. Thank you Roman Uhlig for an amazing concept and a great chill with a pinch of intense time!Looking forward to more beautiful soudtracks, new game modes and the most imporant: The Online Multiplayer!Bless."

,Recommended,529950,26251351,"Posted: 27 October, 2016",all,referee111,"Wow. Wow, wow, wow. For this price, I have never played a game with this much quality. The 3D graphics are stunning and are sometimes not seen in games worth $5 or more. Again, the game is worth buying just for its quality. Not to mention the control screen is as easy as pressing a button. The game is as simple as that, too! However, we haven't even gotten to the actual game yet.So, what is the game, you ask?This game has 4 different modes with 7 total variations total. Arena and Trails are free-for-all modes, Blizzard and Multiball are team modes, and Arena, Trails, and Blizzard have practice variations. For every mode, there are 7-8 maps you can play on. On these map, there are circles of various sizes and location through it. After you select your button, you can press the button when in the circles to go around them in an orbit (hence ""orbits"" in the title). When you press your button outside the circle, you dash forward, which can be beneficial or hurtful, depending on the mode. You can always tell the direction of your character by looking at where the arow points. It never breaks physics, but it is helpful for when you have a lot of characters on the screen, and a small bit of color isn't enough to keep your eye focused. In addition, there are modifications for the four multiplayer modes, giving you flexibility and countless arangements of fun! Lastly, if you are in a circle and an opponent or sphere hits you, your orbit will break unless you hit your button immediately afterwards. Alright, let's go on to the modes!First, we will begin with Arena, which is probably what could be considered the basic mode. You have to direct your character towards various white spheres. When you hit one, every other player cannot hit them or thy die. The same goes for you if you hit an opponent's sphere. It is possible to change the color of spheres around you if you hit a big open circle. However, these are really uncommon, aren't seen until later in the game, and only have a certain radius from which all the spheres will become your color. It's a relatively simple mode.       (*_* )Secondly, we have Trails. In this mode, you have to pick up white spheres like before, but this time, they extend off of you wen you pick them up. You become a big snake, and you have to use your sphere segments to kill the opponent; hitting head-to-head with your opponent bounces the two players off one another. There are big open circles in this mode, too. In this mode, they steal any nearby white spheres or segments from other players and adds them to your length. The game functions on a first-to-five basis: First player to five wins... wins!Thirdly, we have Blizzard. Blizzard is different from other modes because it has a solid line down the middle, preventing you to leave your half. On the black line lie two spheres which can be hit from either side. The objective is to hit the white spheres into the goal on the other side. However, players can send spheres your way, too. You can defend by touching the colored spheres that head towards your goal. If you or an opponent miss, it is probable a goal will be scored. When a goal is scored, a line of the goal is taken away, making it tougher for that team to hit into it. It keeps the game balanced and exciting the entire time and gives the team that's down a chance to come back. It's also important to know that spheres hit out of the middle never despawn, but turn white after a goal is scored. This results in the screen being filled with madness come late game if you don't play your cards right!Lastly, we have Multiball. Multiball is like easy-mode Blizzard. There is no black line, so players can move throughout the map. You still defend and score in the same ways. However, there are some big changes. Goals are circular and don't take up the entire edge, so it is a little harder to score. You can hit your colored sphere into your goal, but it will not count against you and the sphere will rest in the middle. Lastly, an open circle spawns in the middle when two white spheres are    present, making it so a team could quickly posses both of them from the outset.Though there are practice versions of Arena, Trails, and Blizzard, they are based on endurance and a lot less fun then the actual game. If you have a friend, play the real game, not practice.This game gives remarkable value for $1.99. I am thouroughly impressed with what was accomplished with this game. It will be tough to find a great game like this for under $10, and I'm being serious here. I cannot thank the developers enough for making this, as my friends and I have had countless great moments with this game, with more coming long into the future. Dev(s), I love you. <3"
