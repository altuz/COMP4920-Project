76561198071309276,Not Recommended,530040,28447819,"Posted: 18 December, 2016",all,Creomant,"I love RTS games. My history with them started with Warcraft I, and then I played pretty much all RTSes out there. As others pointed out Reconquest is trying to back to the basis and it is doing for good and also the bad. Trailers showing very cool game but it might be a bit deceiving.Reconquer is a game of heavy contradictions, created by experienced but very few devs. I am not sure if list of flaws below is a result of a few devs or speedy development, but what we can buy right now is more like ab advanced proof of concept or Early Access than well-finished game. It is possible that the game was a vision of a team members without much of a leadership and product-owning, which would help to go out of developer box and see the problematic areas (it is hard especially within small teams so I understand the pain of it).I won't ask for refund as I believe it has potential, and I will gladly re-review after a while. But now, let's go to the meat:The good:1. I like the graphic, A LOT. It is not too fancy, it doesn't have bilions of lights, it's atmospheric, well toned and with nice effects. It's not overwhealming the gameplay but it's not painful to watch.2. I love the climate. It reminds me a lot of another C&C copy: KK'n'D, and SunAge. It's excellent setting to do something good.3. I like the unit design (vehicles). It's not too fancy, it's solid. There is no some strange energy weaponry, just solid machinegun, cannon and rockets. I like that a lot.4. Game loads very fast and work decently.5. Main menu music :)6. You can manouver units to ditch enemy shots / rockets, and shots back.The bad:1. UI is very rought and uninformative is some cases, for example I haven't found a way to know how much gas left in extraction point or if it's infinite2. The gas collectors has issues if you put refineries too close to extractor points. Also icons for an order to start extraction is far to small to see difference from normal one.3. Both factions seems too similar to each other (rocket buggy, tank, heavy tank, mammoth tank etc) and still units seems to have balance issues.4. Infantry animation is weird5. Mission briefs shown as a poorly made comic stripes with text with basic white font... VERY unattractive approach. It'll be better just to give a text mission summary if not deciding to put something better6. When you can manouver with your units, AI tends to simply stand at one place which makes them easy target. Their numbers are the only advantage in that case.7. During campaing, in menu I can start new skirmish, but I cannot restart campaign mission, seriously?8. During campaign you can see all units and buildings, even if you won't have an access to them during mission. It's a small flaw, but annoying.9. VERY annoying way of repairing. You have to click a building and then icon of repairing separalery.The worst:1. Infantry is expensive and useless. I know it's the sin of the most base-building RTSes (especially from past), but nowadays it'll be cool to find them more useul, or at least cheaper/fast produced if we want them to die so massively.2. Campaign is just spamfest and there is no selection of difficulty. I doubt there is any AI involved, probably just scripted loops. I know I will beat it after a while, but some newcomers to the RTS will find it hard.3. Game is hurt by typical ""Creator knows it all"" and assumptions that any player knows the mechanics of the game. I am not talking about tutorial even, but game in general. The game has been played / tested by very limited amount of players, potentially the creators themselves only.4. RTS without even LAN or TCP/IP multiplayer? Hopefully it'll be added in the close future.In summary, at this stage I cannot recommend the game. It has too many flaws to call it finished. It's much more early access kind of stage than full product. But if the team can keep work on it, brush up the issues, it can be a very strong product in the very silent universe of RTSes."

Well done to the team that created this, you have brought back some RTS joy. I can definitely seem myself playing this for extended periods of time.A a few other people in the comments pointed out, there's a little bit of polish that would make the game really amazing.The only comment I have is to improve the scrolling. When you move your cursor to the edge of the screen, it takes a good second to respond, which can get annoying. Also, if you hover over the map or in the top right, it doesn't scroll at all I find.If the scrolling was a lot more responsive and smoother it would be a massive imporvement.Other than that, thanks for the awesome game.

The AI is a little easy and predictable but it is good enough to keep you coming back for more. Being a huge RTS fan, here are the Pros and Cons of what I liked about the game:Pros:Base BuildingResource collection (using a system somwhere inbetween CnC 3 and Red Alert 3).Well balanced tanksGraphics (the graphics are very clean and particle effects are quite beautiful)Bug free (I haven't come across a single game breaking bug on my PC)Good audio and voice acting (it never gets tedious or over bearing)Clever implementation of a story using comic book style cutscenesClean GUICons:Infantry feel too weak and useless. I only used them on the first mission or two.Only one environment to play in. It would have been nice if there were more variety to the maps.No multiplayerTwo factions feel too similar. Seen as though this is a single player game only, I really wish the factions had more diversity in units.Too easy to turtle. The game would be more fun if it forced you to leave your starting position.All in all a good game with some solid RTS mechanics. I feel all it's short comings are due to budget restrictions. They've done wonders considering the small Indie team and I have to recommend this to RTS fans who want a simple, traditional take on RTS."

If you are looking for old classic RTS, do not look elsewhere anymore. I would say, buy with caution, but for currently 15 EUR, it is a game which will bring you closest feeling playing those old Dune2000, Command and Conquer Tiberium Wars, KKND ... there is no closer RTS to mentioned ones currently out there. Graphics is much better than mentioned games, but gameplay feels similar, which is good point here as I really wanted to play some old classic wih modern graphics. And that is, what reconquer can offer you. I replayed yesterday also several missions from KKND and I can say reconquest gives me that old feeling with better visuals and much better controlability like modern ones/WSAD for map movement etc/ Missions are similar and once you discover, what to build first, you will quite overhelm opponent and win. But just like old ones. There are some small things which needs to be updated and advancing buildings and units can be more deep, it is satisfiyng experience for me. I get, what I wanted. If you want modern RTS, do not buy, but if you like quite old ones, you will be pleased. For this price point, I can recommend it. and sorry for not very good english"

I played like 25mins with are (from my point of view) enough to tell that this is sadly not going to work to revive the base building RTS genre. And i was actually quite looking forward to this release.The vehicles are unbalanced, riflemans are cannon fodder just like the low tier vehicles. A pile of ""defenders"" & tanks will do the job if its correctly done while some Turrets (with an insane OP build range) will keep your base defended quite decent.The setting, the 2 factions and the basic ingame build menue are sort of C&C RedAlert, Tiberium style which is a nice thing actually and the soundtrack also sounds a bit like a RedAlert game. But its missing the seperate windows for units and the unit shortcuts.Graphics are ok for beeing a game that builds on the unity engine.Problems are: pathfinding, initial base placement on the start of a skirmish game, terrain collisions (some rocks seem to not have any colliders and rockets are just going through them)It is sad that C&C died and the base building RTS with it. reconquest is a small flag at the end of the horizon but... Its not good for an actual release. I dont know if it would be better to be released as an early access but as it is as an actual released game. It just does not work."

The base building is quick like in old C&C games but it always ends up being the same sort of base and as the AI attacks the same ways, it makes defending really easy.The main problem I have is that I feel that this game has cheated me out of my money as the content is limited to a few levels, just rotated or adding a few extra hills in, and does not offer the hours of fun building a massive army to attack a very heavy defended enemy ,like in old C&C games, as the enemy can chew though vehicles very quickly and the army that u spent loads of time sorting out, is dead in seconds, watching the heavy tanks get killed by light turrets is stupid as this game is no way balenced with the weapon strength and armour values.My last thought is that if this game was CHEAPER, then buy it for a few hours of fun, but as I am now stuck with a game that is unfinished and broken, dont waste your money.PS..

Build 5 of those and the AI cant get past. Doesnt matter if its infantry or not. Then you can in your own time build up your doomstack and just waltz right in. The campaign is a joke. Its basically the same maps on boths sides with them doing the opposite. All units are the same with different models. The graphics are good enough but there is plenty of hit detection bugs where units are pushed out over an edge and just stands there glitching up and down. The UI is good enough, to few indicators (like no deploy mouse cursor when moving an MCV), some tried and true staples. It works good enough. The healthbars are overly big for some reason. It hits some tropes and nostalgia and what makes an RTS great, but it misses out on the majority makin this the most mediocre 6 hours of RTS ive ever played. Go back and play the old ones instead.

For examples: the same vehicles sometimes attack a target at range, sometimes instead they move toward and next to the target (putting them in firing range of additional enemies); the screen edge scrolling doesn't work at all the edges; repairing buildings requires hovering over the building and then pressing 'r' (this is in complete reverse of every other RTS where you select repair and then choose the building); vehicles can't be repaired; selecting units to group them is difficult and usually requires putting some into the group then selecting others to add to the group; only one structure (of any type) can be built at once - if you need to build a power plant, that can't be under construction at the same time as a turret.I understand that it's only 18.US, which forgives some things but others are just too rough at this point."

I really wanted to like this and support a developer working on a classic RTS style game, but this simply isn't worth it even on sale. The basic mechanics are there and the graphics and music are ok, but it just feels unfinished and lacking - only one background, poor AI (it just keeps sending small waves of troops at you in the exact same place at regular intervals), slow movement, very limited upgrade options for buildings or vehicles (which seem to make little difference anyway), can only repair one vehicle at a time even with multiple factories, no ability to build second bases (might have been possible later in the game but I'd given up before then). The missions themselves are dull, and the story is presented in quite possibly the worst drawn and written comic book-style panels I've ever seen. The game would literally be better off without them and their inclusion makes it feel very cheap and amateurish. Considering that C&C3 can be had for less and is better in every single way by a big margin, it's impossible to recommend this.

The first mission (as the blue team) was ok to play, but it looks the game turns out to be a spam fest you never seen before from mission 2, where it feels like the AI is cheating where it spams lots of vehicles which you try to counter with the few ones you succeeded to bring out. It feels like devs either have not played the mission enough or they have not the best judgement regarding how to balance a game to make it fun to play.2. Missing unit info. When you target either your own or enemy units you get no info at all about them (name, type, etc...).3. You can create tanks, but you can't repair them!?4. Infantary units die way to easy, so it's kinda pointless to create them in the first place.5. I can't do common attack moves either.6. The animation of infantary units while they run looks kinda funny (as they need to go to bathroom). :)In short:I can not recommend this game as it feels little to rough around all its edges. It feels like devs have played their game way to little as the fun factor is not there (at least for me). C&C as they try to copy is a far better and more enjoyable game on all fronts. It would also be good if you could play this game with your friends. I may change this review later if they improve all these issues so the game become much more fun to play than its current state."

The controls are good enough, but its very BASIC, not many variety of units and structures, they're all the same on both factions but just modelled differently.I've tried to get into it but can't, the story is comic book style and just paper thin. Don't bother getting this if you're looking for a similar C&C title/Clone cos you'll be disappointed!"

However the background story is not that difficult to understand.There are two groups and two campaings you can play - United Cities and the Outlaw clan.I would say it´s a world like you see in ""Mad Max"" and technology you see in ""Earth 2150"".Any thoughts?The first thing you notice when playing the game, the base building feels like Command & Conquer, something I really like.I had absolute no problem setting up my base. I set up a Gas harverster station and build barracks... wait, one thing, in reconquest you can see all the high tech buildings right away but you cannot build things like the flight hangar or tech center until later in the game. Dont get fooled, the radar station in mission 1 is only for the radar mini map.One problem though, the tutorial (if you call it a tutorial) only gives you one order ""build a gas harvester"", thats it. I was expecting to have some time to set up my base and get to know everything but the outlaws (Yes, I played the Atreides... eh UC - nice hawk logo guys ;))attacked a little too quickly and I failed the first mission.The moment I knew I fail I wanted to restart the mission quickly but this function seems to be missing? Not a big issue but something to consider for a patch - thanks.The coolest ""flash-back"" moment alot of you RTS fans will have is the moment the voice overs kick in - building units and facilities activies the ""Construction ready""voice over. And the female voice-over voice is awesome - feels like Command & Conquer.Well time to get back into the game and continue to fight for peace and liberation.I hope to be able to add more Pro´s and Con´s later today.Update:The devs just released an update which helped me to survive mission 4 (United Cities campaign)"

Several features like attack move, patrol, way point system, select all for unit types and the mouse-over information are missing. The unit selection for both factions are mirrors of each other and not much to choose from.The graphics and some of the units reminded me of Dune 2000 and KKND. This game should be free or at most $5 for what it has to offer. I would reconsider buying if there are more basic features and effort put into this game.P.S: The game seems to use cap letter very sparingly, not sure why it is so."

However with no Online mode against other humans, game was boring after 1 night.  Comp stomps are only so much fun.  Bigger maps would also have been nice.  Unit upgrades stalled out way to soon.

Gas harvestors drive in circles at harvest points and gas stations for some time which has quite a substantial impact on game experience as cash flow is too limited. Hopefully gremlins can be ironed out.

I started playing and was immediately unimpressed with the visuals, and even more saddened when my units altogether stopped moving on the battle field in the second mission.

It almost feels like the original on a new engine with a re-skin. Controls are dumbed down like crazy. basic point and click, no advanced moves like attack move or anything like that. No tooltips to let you know what the building is, or tech tree. Even with all that taken into consideration, I still really like the game, I absolutely love the orignal C&C, so much so, I remember renting it for N64 for 2 months straight. Its nostalgic, and thats about the only good thing to this. If they were going for a straight up remake, its pretty close mechanics wise, story is another thing. simple comic style cut scenes for the campaiggn, didnt even bother to read them. Would I reccomend this? for what I paid, yes, full price maybe not, only if you really want some original C&C styled gameplay."

With a little polishing and a few fixes (scrollling at all screen edges would be helpful, and it'd be nice to see an improvement in the story presentation as the comic strips just don't work)For an indie game (and at a reasonable price), this is quite nicely done and I'd certainly suggest taking the time to have a play! Thank you StormCube for reminding the big players of what they'd forgotten. Hopefully there's development coming to take them on head-to-head in the future, as the genre is crying out for it!"
