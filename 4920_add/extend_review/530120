,Recommended,530120,32495173,Posted: 16 June,all,LimpArms McGee,"I love this game. Everyone who comes over to try VR for the first time definitely gets a few levels on this game. The quality of this game for the price, and given it's indie status is impressive beyond belief. I'd love to see more developer activity, because as much as I am currently happy with the amount of content in the game, I'd be thrilled for some more new content. Be that a new ""VR Duo"" game, like Pizza Duo or Sushi Duo for example, are games I would absolutely love to see. Even if Pizza and Sushi was just paid DLC for Diner Duo, that would make me more than happy. I'd love to have a Pizza Parlor or Sushi Shop Duo! Diner Duo is just so much fun and I think those ideas would be absolutely worth investing in. VR The Diner Duo is a great VR game, and a necessary VR experience in my opinion. If you don't have it yet, buy it immediately, on sale or not! It's worth much more! Highly recommend this game."

The levels start off fairly easy, which let's you get comfortable with the mechanics, but it quickly gets chaotic in the kitchen.  My GF and I had a blast with this game (level 20 so far). You'll quickly find out if you have good communication skills with your other half.""I said TWO #10's and a single with ketchup!"", she yells from across the diner.""That's what I made, right?...wait...ahhh crap, I forgot the cucumber! And what does that guy near the window want?"", he queries.""Oh @#$%, I didn't see him come in!""""Two #10's and a single with ketchup at the pass! Ding! Ding! Ding!"", he snickers.A fun game solo for sure but this shines in local multiplayer! Thankfully the dishes are virtual in this one guys!  ;)Simple intuitive controls, perfect artstyle for this type of game (similar to job sim), challenging levels, endless mode for highscore chasers and a wicked catchy soundtrack. Plus the scale and height of the kitchen is fully adjustable for all sizes.Get it!Ding! Ding!"
76561198045832074,Recommended,530120,29218375,Posted: 12 January,all,Dannyo,"The co-op is where this really shines. Really fun and has so much room for growth. Most VR games get stale quickly. Even with the early state this is in right now, it is still more entertaining than many others. It doesn't do much (yet), but what it does, it does well, and it is fun while doing it. So many cool things that can be done and would make it even better, one of the few VR games I am looking forward to seeing more content released.My wishlist:1. Money: Being fast shouldn't just get you points, I want tips that I can use to fund things.2. Unlockables: Can I buy that soda machine? Or upgrade it? Maybe buy a deep fryer and make fries or onion rings, to then make more money? Maybe buy a larger grill to cook more at a time? Maybe buy a new restraunt that looks different? Decorations for my restraunt?3. More players: This one may be hard, and may not be possible. The formula now is good now with two players, and adding more may disrupt that. This would require more things for non-VR players to do though. Unless perhaps you bought a larger restraunt, but that may end up putting more strain on the chef in the end.4. More locations: Maybe a higher level that is a nice, expensive restraunt? Or maybe a single player level that is a noodle stand? Maybe a food truck? So many possibilities to add a new spin to gameplay.5. Food quality: Maybe buy your ingredients for each day/week. Better ingredients means happier customers. But also quality in cooking. Maybe there is an optimal time to remove food from the grill, rather than just raw/cooked/burned, which could correlate to tips.6. Food cost: What about that burger you have to throw away? That stuff isn't free, that is lost income. Same with those ""free"" pies, they cost somebody something.(The only thing I could criticize is that burgers cook then burn just a little too fast, but maybe that is just the chef in me. I want to put the patties on the grill first, then prepare plates and buns, but by then they are burned. Might slow down the gameplay, but could allow for preparing more meals at once and being able to deal with more customers more easily)."

This game also solves the problem of vr being an expensive hobby therefore being hard to share with others, while its singleplayer mode acknowledges that you may not always have a partner to play with.Take notes future developers, this is how you make a good vr game."

As for me, well I had to get it set up didn't I? I had a blast and a workout. This is a great family game. It's fun, humorous, sometimes silly. Even the spectators are calling out numbers for the chef or telling the waitress that they just passed someone who needs a green drink.There are no stars for rating so let's say I give it six out of five."

All the looking around and grabbing as fast as I could made me dizzy, and as the game got harder, it got less like a game and more like a real job. It was pretty fun to play with co-op, but I didn't find it very fun over-all. I think $15 is too expensive for the amount of content. Might be fun to play drunk with a bunch of friends, but not much for just a couple people."

If you still find this a lot of fun after 10 minutes I would be really surprised. The controls aren't bad and the gameplay is fine but there's literally 0 depth to the game. Don't waste your money.

While the multiplayer aspect is functional it gets old quick with trying to remember and serve burger to each customer. The server has to remember drink orders and serve pie to keep customers happy and the cook has to create burger types based on a specific menu listed behind you in game. Its a simulation of working at a diner. Simple as that.Note: I requested a refund after 40 minutes of play.

,Recommended,530120,28518791,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,M1SF0RTUNE,"One of my favorite games on the Vive so far has been Job Simulator, simply because of the immense possibility it provides and how much fun it can be to mess around with a charming yet relatable setting. Part of me wishes the game wasn't so short and could've expanded the jobs a bit more.This is a large part of the reason why I absolutely love Diner Duo, which not only takes the ideas from Job Simulator, but expands them into brave new territories for VR multiplayer games.---The game is fairly simple in concept. You're a chef making burgers for customers, and there's a bunch of different burgers you can make. But this makes way to a very challenging game of dexterity, coordination, and memory as you quickly try to make several different types of burgers for a whole diner full of impatient customers. There's plenty of fun screwing around and even some customization to go with your burger flipping goodness, and the art style is akin to Job Simulator with the robot waiters and customers who go about your diner.But the real magic to Diner Duo is in the asymmetric co-op multiplayer, which is sadly local only. But while it may be local, it is more than worth finding a friend to try the game with.In singleplayer, you play as a chef while the waiters show you easy-to-follow icons of the recipes you need to make as they patiently wait for you to make them. But in co-op, the second player controls the waiter. So instead of getting handy-dandy icons to look up and read, the waiter will call out orders from customers while you try and make them. This requires the chef player to start committing recipes to memory as a #1 hamburger is followed up by a #16 double-stacker cheeseburger with zuchini and mushrooms, ketchup, and mustard stacked in exactly the right order.While the chef has to handle the cooking and recipe memorization process, the waiter meanwhile has to relay the information to the chef as they avoid customers bumping into them while carrying drinks to serve to the customers, and serve pie when they're getting particularly impatient. This in some ways can raise stress levels pretty high, but for a very well coordinated couple of players with a great sense of communication, it makes for an undeniably rewarding experience of comradarie and teamwork.Something else that's relatively minor, but deserves some seriously special mention is the manual customization of the play space. Far few games try to contain you to a single region of your room that may end up being incredibly inconvenient, too tall or too short for your height or hard to interact with because of the scale. Plus you could hit your friend trying to cook a mean cheeseburger in co-op. But thank goodness Diner Duo came with some incredibly handy levers in the main menu to adjust height, scale, shelf height, and position of the play area. Now if we could just find a way to rotate the play area too, then it'd make it perfect.Couple this with making the game fun to pass around to change roles or have friends try and beat your score, it becomes a very fun social experience on top of a solidly designed game. In fact, the concept is such a great and well-executed idea that it's a shame how minimal the game is in terms of actual content.---The game is something of an arcade experience, having only a decent handful of levels that last about 2-3 minutes a-piece that gradually ramp the challenge up as new recipes are thrown into the mix. But it's all over before you know it and there's not a whole lot to keep you coming back for more. For example, there's no leaderboard support. The levels show a high score but it doesn't show who got it or who was playing as what role, so it doesn't give that extra incentive to beat your couch buddies unlike something like Space Pirate Trainer. It's also a shame not to have some type of option to play online. There's customization in the way of hats for your human chef character (that are done via unlockables for completing levels) as well as customizing the waiters, but there aren't a great deal many to choose from and you can't customize your diner. Plus the only menu item in Diner Duo are burgers, so no expansive meals to rotate between just yet.There's also a lot of tools that could add more content to the game, like workshop support, custom recipes, custom stages, customization options for the layout of the food on the table, or a way to have random players place orders to challenge the chef. There's no endless mode, options to customize your chef outside of hats, no ways to earn bonus points for timely/perfect orders, no sort of ""team vs team score attack"" mode where one team tries to shoot for a high score, trades to another team, and they try to beat it. It's things like these that could add more depth and versatility to expand such a strong concept of a game, but we're left with an extremely well-put-together tech demo that lasts far shorter than I wish it does.---All in all, I absolutely love Diner Duo's relatively simple but engaging gameplay, and it's an even more incredible experience when bringing a friend along. I'd definitely love to see more content added to the game or a potential sequel in the future to explore more gameplay with the waiter, more types of food to make, a more streamlined and visually-complimentary UI, and more ways to expand the arcade experience that Diner Duo excels at. Maybe if it takes only a couple more cues from the clear inspiration of Job Simulator in regards to the polish and UI, then we'll no doubt have a very special multiplayer game VR multiplayer fan should have.That said, grab an apron, grab a friend, and open your new restaurant to serve some juicy burgers!"

Playing it for one evening with a few friends more than justified the asking price – I would throw money at a sequel or DLC (fries, anyone?) without hesitation.Praise: Difficulty curve is good and will put your memory and cooperation skills to the test. Star rankings and unlockable hats/skins encourage you to perfect each level. The cook can be surprisingly emotive and hilarious from the waiter's perspective. Nice touches like the ""order up"" bell and being able to hurl a diner's order directly to them. Physical parameters of the VR space are all adjustable for different player/room sizes.Gripes: Achievements would be nice. Picking up the item you want can be frustrating (e.g. trying to pick up the plate a burger is on, rather than picking up the burger off the plate). With Vive controllers at least, your ""hands"" aren't in the same position and orientation as your actual hands, which takes some getting used to.

It's is inexpensive, fun, challenging at times, easy to drop in, easy to share and fun with a friend. I highly recommend this game to anyone with a Vive. Worth the purchase for sure!"

The person controlling the waiter will be using a keyboard and monitor
,Recommended,530120,32286394,Posted: 9 June,all,AwesomeNick,"One of my absolute favorite VR games! There's a ton of content and surprisingly a really high skill ceiling that I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to reach. It's funny because Duo is in the title, but I think the main attraction is really just being the VR player. It's definitely not nearly as fun to be on Keyboard / Mouse. (I'm glad it's in there though, gives me more excuses to play!)"

76561197991269066,Recommended,530120,33970859,Posted: 2 August,all,Maglot,"This is a really fun game that you can play with friends locally! The person wearing the VR helmet plays the chef, and someone sitting at the computer can play the waiter. If you're playing by yourself, you just take care of the burger making. The difficulty eases you in slowly and continues to add new challenges with each level, and there are about 40 or so I think. All of the motions are fun to do, like slicing the cucumber and plating the burgers. The music is pretty good but I prefer muting it and putting on my own jam to flip patties to. Kept me entertained for WAY longer than I thought it would. Definitely recommend."
