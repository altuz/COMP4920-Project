I can draw better looking weapons then half of whats in this game, the RPK literally made me laugh when i seen it. Theres a weapon that looks like a LAW rocket launcher called flamethrower. There is a russian APC (Looks like a 60s-70s model) with a mounted ppsh 14 WW2 smg on top? It has the mk19 which was most deffinetly not even a prototype in vietnam much less used in action. Literally no one in multiplayer, which i assumed was the case. I was looking for single player anyways. That sucked. Theres like 10-15 arcade stye missions that are just borring. The AI shoot you through walls or dont shoot you at all. Apparently you can reload every weapon in the world in .5 seconds by just putting your hand where the magazine should be. I can make better sound effects for the weapons with my mouth. Better off turning off all the sound and doing sound effects myself...PEW PEW. Shots fall short of where your iron sight is sighted at like 20 meters. Oh for the sights on american weapons they just kinda took a unity asset for a modern day ACOG and just flopped it on top of the weapons, it is literally inside of the carrying handle of the m16.This is a sh***y Playstation 1 game released in 2016 for 20 bucks. Its a joke and a rip off. This shouldnt even be early access much less full release. What ever you do, dont give this the time of day or the money in your pocket. Even though im getting a refund, i still feel like ive lost here some how.Also i understand this was made by a single guy, making games isnt easy. But thats no excuse for this. This guy had to know what kind of garbage he was releasing into the world and did it for a few bucks. He deserves a ticket for littering."
,Not Recommended,530160,25859137,"Posted: 4 October, 2016",all,Mellow_Online1,"I was not expecting something like this to be this astonishingly bad. £15.99 is a rip off for this sort of game.Eve of Destruction is basically a poor man's Call of Duty and make it have the quality of the latest Infinite Warfare trailer.Eve of Destruction - REDUX (and no, I don't udnerstand the REDUX part, I can't find any existing ""Eve of Destruction"") is basically a single/multiplayer FPS. It is divided into different game modes, with a primary focus on the Combat game mode.Now, I will start off by saying when the game first started, I was semi impressed. I saw the amount of maps that the game had and it had a good 30 ""different"" maps. I'm using different in quotations for reasons I'll explain later.The first mode I tried out was the only tutorial mission which was helicopter training. I jump in and realise that graphics are awful, Call of Duty on PS1 graphics I'm talking about, and I'm talking about the game on max settings. The helicopter training is also unbeatable as the helicopter controls are terrible. I don't usually expect helicopter controls in games to be great but I expect that I can at least control the altitude of the thing. In Eve of Destruction, you can barely do anything as nearly all movement of the helicopter is depending on the mouse and not only that, the W key is used for moving forward and gaining altitude and the S key is used to descend and move backwards, imagine how hard it is to reach an objective using that sort of process.Anyway, enough about the tutorial, what's the rest of the game like? Well, the rest of the game is just starting to get bad.Nearly all of the game modes have a form of unplayability factor to them or just shear boredom that you cna't really press forwards to continue playing it.One issue that the game also has is that you can't apply a differetn game mode to a different map, each map has a designated game mode/s to them (when I say s, I mean that there are about 5 of them that have 2 game modes to them) the maps that do have more than 1 game mode to it use that other game mode as jsut a tacky add on that doesn't even seem fitting with the map.I'll talk about a few of the game modes that are worth talking about as these are the main stand points of the game.Combat is probably the primary game mode the game pushes out and it's also the most generic. It's basically Capture the Flag + bad AI teammates. You can choose from 2 teams and you need to have your team conquer all the flags on the map. The primary problem that it has is that each team have designated flags assigned to them. You don't start off with an equal amount of flags (or at least not always) and you're never told before you've actually chosen your team what the amount of starting flags are. The 2nd issue is that the AI of the teammates is some of the worst I've ever seen. Your teammates just run around in circles and don't really help you out much. The enemy AI  on the other hand seem to vary from being bad like your teammates and being unfair. For starters, the AI seem to be able to shoot through the walls whereas you can't so that's already unfair. But then sometimes the enemy AI just sometimes decide to not shoot at you. I can't figure out why they aren't shooting at me sometimes and other times they don't.There's a game mode where you fire missiles down on planes/helicopters that don't even attack you which is also really boring when the thing actually functions correctly.The racing in the game also has some unplayability. If your car flips, there is no way to actually get the thing back up so that means game over and with the bizarre AI attached to it, you'll get flipped over a lot.There is also other forms of warfare, there's air warfare where (if you payed attention to the tutorial I played) you can sort of expect having warfare with jets and helicopters will go.There's boat warfare and the enemy AI is worse on that as they'll just keep crashing their boats into everything and pose as little to no threat to you.Now, let me talk about the maps. Even though (like I said) I was impressed with the amount of maps that were created at the start, once I actually played them, most of them felt tacky, cheap and unfinished. Items, houses everything is recycled wherever possible and most of the maps feel like I'm playing in the same empty environment. Also, there's a map in the game and according to the map, there was emant to be other buildings implemented because they're on the map, but not actually PHYSICALLY there.The multiplayer isn't that good as there's barely anyone playing and is primarily occupied by bots (and you know what they're like)Your weapons also decide to freak out from time to time. The ironsights on your guns sometimes works, sometimes don't and soemtimes decide to put the ironsights in the middle of the gun so you can't see what you're doing.Even if you can look past all of the flaws I've listed out, the game is still a generic and boring multiplayer FPS that is DEFINATELY overpriced. Personally, this is one of the worst experiences I've ever had.ProsCons- Bad graphics- Bad vehicle controls- Recycled maps- Missing locations- Bad AI- Some game modes are unplayableFinal verdict: 1/10My Steam Cuarator group:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews"
,Not Recommended,530160,30135933,Posted: 23 February,all,DeadlyDoRight,"This game needs some serious improvement before i can seriously recommend it to anyone.In this day and age a game of this quality has no business being worth more than 10 bucks.If this was an early access game in development than I could understand the reason for it's poor state,  but still there's no way itshould be 20 USD.One thing I dislike about it is the fact that  the controls are strictly default and there's no way to change it.Game play is stiff and not very smooth.And on top of poor quality of gameplay is the primitive looking graphics more reminiscent of a game that came out in2003 or 2004."

I got hope they will make the Weapons skins/ flight control better soon enough thoI do reccommend this game though as I am aware of their works and know their capable of doing a lot more as they did in the past"

,Recommended,530160,34669752,Posted: 1 September,all,Queenie,"PLEASE NOTE: MY RECOMMENDATION COMES WITH A HUGE ASTERISK!* This game is actually terrible!However, it's a kind of terrible that I cannot help but find hilarious, it's the kind of terrible that I cannot help but laugh my damn♥♥♥♥♥♥off at. The plane flying minigame alone is so damn funny, due to it's utterly broken control scheme, that it's a barrel of goddamn laughs.If you're looking for a serious experience, battlefield 1942 or the like, stay away from this game as it's probably one of the worst FPS games I've played. However, I have way more fun with this than I do C.O.D and in comparison to other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ FPS games, it's better than some cynical♥♥♥♥♥piece of trash like Stealth Force: The War on Terror. The game tries to have a lot of variety and you're bound to find something so inept that you'll burst out laughing at it.A complete and utter abomination... but a hilarious one at that."
,Recommended,530160,31622247,Posted: 8 May,all,FMhades,"I recommend this game to all those people who like shooters based in the era of Vietnam.The game is being improved but still it lacks many things to solve.The developer of this game is one of the members who developed the Eve of Destruction mod for Battlefield 1942, Battlefield Vietnam and Battlefield 2.And that says a lot since he is an experienced person.If you are encouraged to buy this game then do not ask for a refund since as I tell you the game is being updated to correct all the bugs."

I can get past bad graphics and clunky game design, but this one... it's awful. :(I love the Vietnam war setting so much and there is actually a surprising amount of content here (a lot of maps, vehicles, and weapons), but they're all awful.  Most of the guns seem to use royalty free stock sound effects and the guns are rendered terribly.I would only buy this game if it were $0.99 or less."

The biggest complaint i have is the a.i. is wonky. that wouldnt really be a problem if more people played multiplayer. also i would like to see mabye a difficulty selector of somesorts, to make the game more difficult as it is easy to attack and defend on a single player game."

76561197963521462,Recommended,530160,31891098,Posted: 21 May,all,Slizerzak,"I have been playing Bf42 for a long time and when I saw EOD was a stand alone game now was very interested. I still play the EOD mod so I had to try this and have to say after reading reviews I was very hesitant to spend the money. I guess for people who never played old school FPS (bf42, soldner, joint operations, flashpoint) they may find this game lacking all the bells and whistles of a modern FPS but thats made up for in gameplay and content. Yes there are plenty of bugs but nothing gamebreaking mostly the AI acts strange but they still put up a fight. The game has tons of content like the original EOD had but looks much better on the unity engine. If you like a straight forward COD type game with objectives and story lines this is not for you. If you like a open sandbox shooter with no objective but to have fun this game is for you. This game has tons of potential and really brings back the fun of the old school FPS. I really hope the dev keeps continuing the work on this because after a lot of polish and bug fixing this could be great FPS with tons of content."

That's means they had to entirely recode the game.Some of the weapon animations are still clunky and the game needs updates in my opinion, but they will do it i feel.As for content : The game has 35 maps, solo and multiplayer, 64 weapons, 196 vehicules (yes u heard me 196 vehicules), the maps are huge, a LOT of different gamemodes to choose from, even zombie mode has been added yesss !!!For now i just hope the devs give as much love to the community with constant updates, and then later on achievements and cards, sales, for more player base.It is just a honor and a huge pleasure to support this game who comes from my early teens, when PC gaming was starting to be really huge (the 2000 era).I recommend to DIE HARD FPS fans, Vietnam era fans, who miss Vietnam games. You will get your pleasure here !!!"

I had too change some settings as it was lagging on my computer. The game play is great but the price is kinda high. Maybe $10 the most is what i would set the price as. With a few patch fixes the game developer might have a really great game.

76561198137546223,Recommended,530160,25803589,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,Red Samurai,"i got like an hour into the game.  I read one bad review and decided to give it a shot anyways.  its indi its Vietnam 20 bucks is so what money for me.  I think you have to play the vietcong to enjoy this game.  First scene is trainer skipped that.  Second scene is you sitting on the beach with an unlimited firing RPG 7 and a pair of RPKs just shooting down American aircraft in an old school arcade setting which makes me sick  as an American but well done.  This game isnt polished at all but it is fun.  I picked the NVA for the next few scenes and they were all fun.  I dont really like the thought of mowing down Americans, but the developer made a playable game.  Im also impressed that you can hurt yourself if you do that dumb jumping around cr5p, might be usefull in multiplayer.  Considering that as the VC/NVA you are fighting with many mobs on your side it has a good cartoony video picture.  Its not just you in an FPS.  So its not perfect, graphics didnt cost a million dollars but for an indi theyre great.  I know what kind of work goes into game making and I think its fun.  I also was playing with period music cranking through my audio player.  Made the game better.  But there is no way an indi could afford the licensing fees for these tunes.   If you think 20 bucks is worth a minimum of 5 hours of entertainment this thing is a buy.  If your a broke kid.  Save your money unless your into Vietnam.  I am.  My dad was there.  Im impressed."
