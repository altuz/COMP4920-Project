76561198349897458,Recommended,530330,29860533,Posted: 11 February,all,PC,"Blameless is a game that I've gotten four or more playthroughs out of, With other people...It's a pretty good game that is a brief 'Mystery' and sort of thriller less than horror, and yes my first time playing it did frighten me a view times with little clever things like, dark corridor was light two seconds ago, loud bang coming from the room next to me kind of clever... There are different endings I was told though I just stuck to the one ending in my playthroughs.Pro's:Eerie atmosphereClever scaresSolid but brief story25 minutes worthIt's FREEI feel bad listing con's because it is a free game... But I must!Con'sNot the best graphicsNot the best SoundtrackLacking in musiccould have better character models and voice oversOk, that's my review for Blameless, It's free, exciting and well worth downloading...7/10Compared to it's oposition, not comparing it with AAA games as obviously that's not fair."
,Recommended,530330,30199696,Posted: 26 February,all,Nuuskiss,The game is short but also good and free - that makes it Blameless..
,Recommended,530330,30149384,Posted: 24 February,all,D3C,"This is a borderline-positive review, as Blameless (as it currently exists) seems like a promising demo for first-person adventure storytelling, but lacks polish. The environment delivered here is exquisitely detailed and feels solid, but persistent clipping bugs and other small issues keep it from feeling ready. The story fragment that this game tells certainly rouses interest and curiosity, but the continuation feels a long way off, if it'll ever come. The puzzles are reasonable, sometimes offering multiple solutions, and the presence of non-helpful items gives the game, on the one hand, a realism that few adventure games offer (in the sense that every object you can interact with has its use somewhere), and on the other hand, can be frustrating as you wonder why more parts of the environment aren't available for interaction. Voice acting is passable at best, and cringe-worthy at worst. If you spend half an hour on this mini-game, I doubt you'll regret it, but you may be left wondering at the potential left unfulfilled."

76561198025641760,Not Recommended,530330,29454165,Posted: 23 January,all,kevindriver,"Totally green player with no research on the game and I ran it in an hour or so with some breaks. It was spooky with no real spooks which actually was disappointing for me.  I am almost concerned if the developer is the freak that knocks you over the head. If the game had more content, (a lot more content) then I might give it a thumbs up, but with little to do and no replay value I cant recommend."

If you like puzzle games with good narrative, check out Firewatch instead.  I know this one is free and Firewatch isn't but if you value your time, then skip this one."

76561197962584064,Recommended,530330,30091165,Posted: 21 February,all,Zeragrin,"Worth the cost of entryThis game has a great 90s adventure game feel with a thriller inspired storyline. The story/ending falls flat but seems to set the game up to be a series so depending on where the devs take it, as a cohesive unit, it could turn out to be great. Technical issues, of which I ran into a few, aside I enjoyed spending an hour wandering around, finding all the item interactions, rooms and I'll be following the series to see where it goes.Technical issues I ran intoGame crashed to desktop after changing video settings in gameGame refused to load save after crash to desktop, had to start a new fileVarious graphical glitches with shadows and lights, though with polish I'm sure these disappear"

Puzzle wise wasn't bad, yet confusing; plot was a bit lacking; glitch present where I managed to fall through the floor into nothingness; I wish I could turn the damn music off.Other than that, pleasant short game to play to waste time.10/10 would read guide again."
76561198126592129,Recommended,530330,29771517,Posted: 7 February,all,StereoCat,"Great little game. It takes about 40 minutes to complete. Most of the puzzles are pretty easy, but still well done, and there are multiple ways to solve some of them which is great. The story is simple but original. The atmosphere is really well done and will keep you on your toes. I can't wait to see the developer's next projects!"
,Recommended,530330,29465372,Posted: 24 January,all,Daring-chan,"This game.... Well, I will mention something that I haven't seen anyone else mention yet. The game was a pain in the butt to get to work. My PC is made to play games, but this game was a nightmare to get to work right, the inventory didn't work, at first, I had to scrap 3 videos because the game was so bugged I couldn't finish it.But, once I did get it to work, I had a pretty fun time with the game, the music is tense at moments and can get you a little uneasy. The puzzles were pretty interesting, the ending was... Dissapointing... To say the least."

,Recommended,530330,29560188,Posted: 29 January,all,Sol Lignum,"A great, sleek game with a bit of nonlinearity and a small plot twist. Not really a horror, just has a little suspence presented. Definitely deserves a price tag."

,Not Recommended,530330,29646968,Posted: 2 February,all,Siledas,"Interesting idea; roughshod execution. Plays like a portfolio piece for a student game developer. Puzzles may frustrate, and the artifice of being trapped in a house breaks down when common sense solutions to simple problems fail at fault of the designer's own internal logic. Try it if you're desperate for more Amnesia or Soma, otherwise, give it a pass.Overall: 4.5/10"
