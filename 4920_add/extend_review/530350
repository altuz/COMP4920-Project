,Recommended,530350,32398257,Posted: 13 June,all,Rekaru,"Teleportation is among the largest complaints in room-scale VR gaming.Smashbox Arena utilizes teleportation in a way that adds depth to the gameplay. An animated teleport must be tossed to a desired teleport location. Once it lands on a flat surface (it will bounce off of non-flat surfaces), a short animation takes place before teleporting the player.A player can cancel their teleport at anytime once it is thrown, and enemy players can cancel each other's teleporters. Many strategies have developed between players using the teleport disc alone. Faking out with teleporters, distracting before shooting, and teleporting onto moving objects.After 300 hours of play time it is safe to say Smashbox Arena is by far the best VR experience I have had since purchasing my Vive. The community surrounding this game is one of the most welcoming I've ever experienced.Having taken part in multiple community held tournaments and leagues it's safe to say competitive multiplayer VR is here, and Smashbox is the definition of a VR eSport.At first glance the gameplay of Smashbox Arena is quite simple. Pick up and shoot balls, teleport around, and knock out the opposing team in 3v3 fights. This simplicity makes Smashbox easy to pick up for new VR players, and highly acessible for venues like VR Arcades.The gameplay contains an added depth thanks to its reliance on room-scale VR. Players can, and must, dodge, lean, crouch, and utilize all 360 degrees in order to master the game.If you have a room-scale VR set up give the Smashbox Arena demo a try. It is the full game but limited to a single map. Players who have purchased the game can jump into the demo game along side you.Check out the guides and discussion boards for tips on how to handle yourself in game, as there is a bit of a skill curve between new and veteran players. If you'd like someone to help you out feel free to send me a friend request here on steam.There are full games being player every day in Smashbox Arena, and it is quite popular at multiple VR Arcades."

Well it basically reminds me a lot of that.  But because the teleportation system is a lot slower, and because you basically get one ""bullet"" per hand (and you can't teleport if your hands are full), it makes the game a lot more tactical than spamming shots at the enemy or just teleporting as fast as you can with the flag.It also helps that the game will automatically fill spots with bots if necessary, something sorely missing from a lot of VR multiplayer games, and they're certainly competent enough in the solo mode, so there's less worry about not being able to play games later if the population falls down.So yes, this may actually be my new favorite VR multiplayer game."

The maps are creative and feel different and the shooting is super rewarding. The throwing teleportation was great for mobility, I tried to flank the enemy team a few times and try different tactics and they worked.I am playing with Oculus Touch and it works well, although it took me a little while to figure out what buttons mapped to what (incoming Oculus support is confrimed, I believe). The experience would be more enjoyable if I had a third sensor for full 360 motion, but the game lets me turn around using the grip button which helps a lot!.I can't wait to get back home and play again!"

,Recommended,530350,28329950,"Posted: 12 December, 2016",all,IronPanda,"I'm on the fence when it comes to multiplayer games, with most of them the only way to get better is to plunge in the deep end and with something like Onward that means looking like a noob. That's enough to turn me off playing unless I can pick it up pretty much instantly. Most multiplayer games lack any decent single player experience, are unusable if there aren't other online players or have dumb AI bots that aren't realistic.With this game I can play progressively tougher matches against competent AI's. When I want I can go up against other players and not look like I don't have a clue. Some of the best games I've seen recently have been Oculus exclusives, polished titles that have had serious money and time spent on them. This looks and feels like one of those, and I mean that in the best possible way.Can't fault this."

The controls are easy to pick up for beginners and the gameplay has enough depth to keep you coming back to improve your skills.  I've spent more hours on this game than any other VR game to date.The developers and support team are excellent and are often playing the game with public players as well.  Recently the game stopped working for me (I had the windows 7 issue that has now been patched).  I emailed support and received a response an hour later.  Over the next 24 hours I had over 20 messages back and forth with a developer who had many fixes to try and even created several special beta-builds of the game for me to test in an attempt to fix my issues.  It turned out the issue wasn't even specific to this game and was happening to me with multiple VR games, but the developer persisted and helped me solve the issue for all the games I was unable to play, not just Smashbox.  Outstanding support!  I was back in Smashbox Arena the evening after I reported the issue and the Win7 fix was made public shortly thereafter.  Thanks Gabe!"

I own well over 50 vive titles and this is the first one that has truly changed what I think about VR and multi-player.I've made tons of friends and the community here is great. I haven't run into a single troll I've had to block or anyone that was out to ruin the game. There is always an active population for multiplayer even late at night and a lot of regular players to befriend.The actual gameplay is great. It's easy to grasp but difficult to master. The best way to learn is with practice and if you have any questions other players will gladly take a minute to give you advice or show you how to do certain things.This game is going to change how people view the Vive as a multi-player platform and I see it becoming the ""Smash Bros"" of the Vive with the continued support of the devoted developers and active fan base."

I just finished playing more than a few rounds.Pros:-Teleportation DONE RIGHT. There is a channeling period when you teleport, and the spot you're teleporting to lights up with your team's color. I'm usually a fan of trackpad locomotion, but the teleporting works out great.-Seemingly no latency issues so far.-The community is great as of now.-The lobby system is really well done. There's a central area where everyone spawns, and then there are shuttles you can all jump on to either start or join an existing game.-I've played a lot of VR titles where I ended up getting bored after about an hour and never looking back. This is a game that I'm sure I'll revisit frequently. I'm definitely playing more tomorrow.-As of right now... this is a multiplayer game with people online actually playing! Everyone I've encountered has agreed that this game is most likely here to stay for a while.Neutral:-There are about 5 or 6 maps right now. I'm sure with popularity that more could be added.Cons:-Lack of ingame options-I really can't think of much else. I think I encountered a glitch where someone's name didn't show up once.Overall, this is a must have for the Vive if you've been looking for a fun multiplayer experience. I'm dying to play more right now, but this game is almost impossible to play quietly. You can pull off some really cool maneuvers that are hard not to exclaim at."

The mechanics are well done - there are powerups that drop throughout the map at various intervals. Movement is by delayed teleport, which works well.The few things I'd fault about the game are nitpicks, and the devs could fix them easily. The voice in the lobby doesn't need to give instructions every 30 seconds (especially while you wait for your friends to join) and the change region area shouldn't require 4 teleports if you're not in the US.

Multiplayer is an absolute blast and the game's fundamental mechanics are really solid. There's lots of strategy and skill in how you aim your teleports, take cover, account for ball flight and bounce when you aim, and use deflections and catches to protect yourself. For those that prefer trackpad-based motion, rest assured that this game is still worth it. I generally prefer trackpad myself, but the mechanics in this game work perfectly for its style of playMultiplayer features 3x3 gameplay, with bots that are automatically rotated in and out of teams to keep things balanced. You're eliminated by a single hit, and each team scores a point when they've knocked out all of the opposing members. First to five wins. When you're knocked out, you see a live map overview that can be rotated and zoomed - and best of all, can continue to shout out encouragement (and warnings) to your teammates. Since rounds finish quickly, you're never waiting to play again for more than a minute.I was impressed by the variety of maps available at launch - and how they encourage a mix of close-quarter and larger-scale gameplay. The power-ups also add some fun unpredictableness to matches, although a few of them feel a bit nerfed (the homing missile is way too slow, for example). Graphics are clean and smooth. I have had zero technical glitches during gameplay so far.Kudos for the developers for delivering such a polished and fun game!"

Not an easy game to master, but fun to play even if you are terrible at it :)The graphics and scenery , 3D elements are well done. One of the few games that lets you utilize room-scale in a way that seamlessly augments the experience (hide behind boxes and trees without having to teleport everywhere).. Mastering the teleport allows you to pop up behind somebody and hit them with your ball."

Well Onward is an amazing game - no doubt - BUT it is not as FUN and easy to pick up. It is nearly 90% of action while Onward may be around 30-40% because of the long dull beginning stages, camping, etc.. this game on the otherhand is PURE ACTION, literally 90% of gameplay, maybe 10% just waiting for rounds to finish or waiting for next round to begin.

,Recommended,530350,28253524,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,EternalGamer,"So I'm updating this review because I've now put almost 25 hours into this game.  Yes 25 hours.  In one week.  This more than anything else I can say is a testament to how good Smashbox arena is, but let me elaborate more anyway.There are a lot of VR games that are ""wow"" experiences.  There are currently still very few ""just one more game and it's 1AM"" experiences.  Smashbox Arena is this kind of game.What makes this game work so well is simply the amount of careful design balance that has been applied to the level design and the power ups and the ways the different power ups play off one another.  There are a lot of subtlies and nuances to the mechanics that gradually become more apparent the more you play and the more you talk to other players.  It's an incredibly easy game to pick up and start having fun with, but it remains fun because it's so well design that winning and losing isn't just simply a matter of reflexes.  It is often a matter of strategy and at any given moment you have a plethora of options on how you approach a given scenario.I know a lot of VR players have become rightly cynical about half finished games, cash grabs, and over hyped experiences.  A lot of even the bigger titles (like Arizona Sunshine) wouldn't really hold up as non-VR games, but they are championed because hey at least there is some substance.  This game is not one of those games. This game is the Rocket League of VR games; it is a similar indie Cinderella story.  This isn't jsut my favorite VR game this year.  It may well be my favorite game this year period."

The developers clearly put thought into it's design and there are lots of little touches frequently missed by many indie titles.  For example, the intro sequence to each match, the confetti guns on the podiums, the detailed spectator mode in the lobby etc. It all blends together to make the experience more enjoyable. There is a well thought out tutorial introducing all the game's mechanics, make this game very easy to pick-up and play for newcomers. The playerbase is sound and I never have issues finding a match. When a player does leave, a bot seamlessly transitions in until someone else joins which usually doesn't take too long. The game mechanics are tuned and very effective, with well thought-out power-ups adding to the fun. The community is friendly and very forgiving to newcomers, everyone is just having fun. This has become my go-to game to pick-up and play at least a few matches. The closest MP competitor for me was Rec Room which I also highly recommend.

,Recommended,530350,28366997,"Posted: 14 December, 2016",all,Jazz,"A fantastic and satisfying VR experience.Of all the VR titles I've played, this one is definitely among the best.It's one of the few out there that truly has a ""finished"" feel to it.Sure, there's room for improvement but Smashbox Arena is an amazing step in the right direction for VR multiplayer games.Pros:- Hillarious and fun gameplay. I found myself booting it up for the first time to just give it a quick try and see what all the hype was about... Fast forward 4 hours and I'm still having a blast at 4:34am.- The story mode. I think the story mode is a fantastic way to introduce players into the game! The difficulties scale decently well and allow players to get a feel for the game before jumping into multiplayer! It could have a bit more added to it as far as content goes, but seeing as how the primary focus of this game is it's multiplayer aspect, it's really easy to overlook.- Great community. I guess this really speaks for the whole VR community in general, but I've met some of the nicest people in this game. Hardly any toxicity!Cons:- Matchmaking. Just like any multiplayer game, there will be multitudes of different skill levels amongst players. This game does have a sort of ranking system where players can earn badges, but there isn't any sort of filtering along with that.. For example if three veterans join a game with 3 newbies, the veterans could end up all on the same team resulting in an incredibly unbalanced game.- Bugs. There are bound to be bugs in nearly any VR game. That's just a given. Even so, there's one particular bug that I've seen multiple times now in which players are able to reach through walls. For example if I'm standing on one side of a wall and you're standing on the other, I can reach my gun forward and stick it through the wall in some cases and shoot you. Not necesarily game breaking, but a definite annoyance.- Bots. The bots in this game, even on their hardest difficulty, aren't much of a challenge. I was able to breeze through all three difficulties in story mode fairly easily. I think some improvements to map awareness for the bots would do wonders as there are times where they get stuck trying to teleport to the same spot over and over. Another thing is that they don't turn in your direction when firing. So if the bot is looking and pointing it's gun to the right, and I'm to it's left, the ball will shoot sideways out of it's gun and hit. This isn't too big of a deal once you get used to it but it can be a bit annoying when a bot is turned one way, making you believe his focus is elsewhere, and then suddenly a ball comes flying towards your face.- Hitbox. The hitboxes in this game can be a bit inconsistent at times. For the most part it's not a problem but there has been a time or two where I've deflected a ball directly away from me but it still registers as a hit. I debated even adding this to cons because of how rarely it happend, but it *did* happen so I figured I should at least say something.The verdict: BUY IT! Smashbox Arena is definitely one you don't want to miss out on. It's multiplayer experience is unrivaled and it packs endless hours of multiplayer entertainment."

The concept is simple, dodge, block, catch incoming balls and try to take out other opponents with your own balls or power-ups. The teleporting mechanism may be my favorite part, as it has a lot of hidden strategy. Before teleporting you send out a disk so others can see you coming, you can use this to trick people and not actually teleport, forcing them to waste whatever weapons they have on them. I spend half of my time in this game sweating from adrenaline, they other laughing uncontrollably. If you've been on the fence about this game, get off, right now."

I think this could be a serious contender for best esport style Arena FPS for VR. Love the power ups idea. Gives it an unreal vibe. It's a super fast paced shooter to boot. There's also a handful of different maps with more to come.If you want a competative shooter that has great potential for esports pick this up. It also has one of the best spectator modes i've ever seen.

Very reminiscent of Rec Room's Paint Ball but with a whole bunch of added touches. It also looks great. And smart thinking on the dev's part to add bots too so you can keep on playing even when there are not anough players. It would be even better if they did some kind of auto team balancing, especially when dealing with bots (1 human and 2 bots against 3 humans is a bit unfair)."

The bots can be really, really, really stupid or incredibly smart. Just depends what difficulty you choose.It's 3 against 3. If there are not 6 people in your lobby, those spots will be filled by bots. There are two modes, regular and ""sniper mode"". In regular mode there are special powerups like shields, the sniper gun, large balls, flaming balls, bombs, etc. Once you are hit you're out for the round. First team to win 5 rounds wins the entire match. Rounds only last a couple minute or so max, so it's very fast paced. Once you die you get to watch your teamates + enemies in a bird's eye...or more like a ""god mode"" view. It's really neat. Maps are chosen at random, but there is a short waiting time between matches where you can choose which team you'd like to be on.The developers really hit a homerun with this game. Like anything, the more complex of a video game the more bugs/issues there are going to be. Onward has a ton of neat features but I've had so many issues with those features. Smashbox is a perfect medium with almost no bugs or issues at all while still providing unique and fun features."

,Not Recommended,530350,28395166,"Posted: 15 December, 2016",all,Revolves,"An okay game - especially if you like the paintball game in rec room. This essentially is paintball from rec room with a few more bells and whistles (power ups, better teleport mechanic, ability to block/catch incoming balls) and some polish on top. I bought this game after seeing the highly positive reviews here on steam and praise for it on the vive subreddit.I played about ten multiplayer games and I realized the game wasn't a hit for me.  There were several problems which  stood out to me:1. As someone playing from Europe, I had to play on the US East region since that's the default region and no one switched to the European one. Perhaps some way to automatically set the best default region would be better? As a result I had some pretty noticeable lag  with a ping varying from 110 to 160. The game felt floaty at times. This is especially noticeable when dying - I would get hit, and after a blink of eye I was dead, still giving me some time to react before the game actually said I was dead.2. Maybe this is also a problem only when playing from Europe - I played the game on a Thursday since my schedule only lets me game on weekdays - but of the ten games I played, only two didn't have two or more bots. Now I'm not against the bots in this game (they're okay - like rocket league bots they sort of just stand  around and sometimes randomly do something good), and it's a good idea to fill up to a 3 v 3 - but it still kind of sucks to play with/against bots. On top of that, somehow the bots were poorly distributed in one of the matches I played. It was a 3 players vs 1 player and 2 bots match - that was a really unfair + not fun match.3. I personally dislike the teleport mechanism in shooting or shooting-like games in general. Smashbox Arena does improve on the mechanic by letting people see where another person is going to teleport to before it actually happens. This does not, however, prevent people from sneaking up behind you far  quicker than it would normally be possible, which makes cover far less valuable. This certainly makes the game more action heavy and fast-paced, but for my tastes it was too chaotic.However, if you like the paint ball game in rec room and you're playing from North America - then this game should be right up your alley. If you're like me and were disappointed from the paintball in rec room, then this game won't be the best thing since Budget Cuts/The Lab/Onward, especially not for the price tag of 23/27 Euros."

It seems this game has been flooding the REDDIT forums and was basically unavoidable because it was very much in your face.  I played it for a few minutes and it felt just like paintball in rec room, just a more polished version.   I didn't need more than just a few minutes of gameplay to realize this game lacked the depth I needed for replayability.  It was too simplistic.  The characters were also very juvenile. I realize the developers were trying to recreate the fun spirit of games like Nintendo's Super Smash Bros and Mario Cart, but the characters lacked any sort of authenticity that come with the history of those games.  Had the character design been developed with someone with original and artistic talent it may have worked but it seems like someone with very little skill in that area came up with the design and It came off feeling cheesy.While I believe others may genuinely like this game it fell flat for me."
