,Recommended,530390,32708816,Posted: 23 June,all,Coreys2cold,"Charming and brutal, this gore-filled sliding puzzle game was tons of fun. There's lots of levels and a bunch of kill moves and characters to unlock. Puzzles are decently challenging but fair and it feels very rewarding to pass them. There are hints, however I've personally been to stubborn to use them so I don't know exactly in what way they assist. The only downside that comes to mind is the soundtrack isn't the best but of course there's always to option to mute the music and play something else from iTunes or something.It's hilarious when you die btw, I won't spoil it. Also in the settings there is a slider for more sliders, some of which are just jokes and I thought they were fairly funny. Definitely take a look at that even if it is only a quick gag.Good game for people who like puzzles and want to also experience some voxel-esque slasher film spoofs."

If you are into campy horror flicks and indie puzzle games, this is a no-brainer. The price-point is wayyy too cheap for a puzzle game that has 15-20 hours of content (...And they just added a few more things yesterday).Essentially, you really only need one joystick for this game - you play the killer, and need to slide your way around the map to get everyone.The layers of complexity are unleashed upon you as you progress. You begin using pieces of the level to solve puzzles; things such as using telephones, landmines, and cats. Yes, cats. The different 'enemies' have different behavior and mechanics. The police are optional to kill, but must not be slid into from the front, for example.Honestly, there really isn't much negative to say about this title. While there is a quick restart button, I requested it be quicker, and they put it on the to-do list. The music and voice acting are top-notch. I mean they freakin' got the actor who playedJasonto do some voice-acting for gawds sakes. All the campy horror films are present. You earn money throughout the game to buy new kill animations and unlock new playable killers. It's all so awesome.Pros:+Awesome fresh idea that brings a novel game mechanic and is really addicting+Learning curve is not bad at all; this is notStephen's Sausage Roll+While you can pick it up for only five minutes, we find ourselves playing for longer play sessions, surprisingly+All the campy horror films and killers are here+Very polished+Too cheap for 15-20 hours of quality content+Controller support is greatCons:-Honestly, none that I can think of; I wanted a quicker 'quick-restart' and they added it to the to-do list-Game is probably too violent for younger childrenAwesome title that I'm glad I grabbed. I even picked up the extra in-game content.If this looks even remotely intriguing to you, go for it."
,Recommended,530390,32212359,Posted: 5 June,all,Anxious Chicken,"Slayaway Camp is a puzzle game at its core.  It is an homage to slasher flicks of the 80s and early 90s in a puzzle game setting.  You play as a series of killers in different movies tasked with killing victims.  The catch is that you have to move in a direction until you hit a wall, object, or your victim.  If you move left, your character goes until he hits something.  So kill the victims and escape through the portal.  Simple.But then the game starts throwing new mechanics into play.  As you progress through each scene/level, you will be introduced to different things.  Scenes which require you to finish within a certain number of turns, scenes that involve holes, mines, cops, and other objects that make your objective more difficult.There are quite a number of levels.  I have gotten through the first 4 movies and still it seems I have much more to get through.  If you get stuck, the game offers you a hint.  For a price, you can get a hint or a step by step walkthrough of the level.  How does this work?  You gain coins after each level, which is used to unlock these kills.I recommend this game to puzzle fans that enjoy horror flicks, or just want a different type of puzzler."

I read his review, took a look at the Store page, and thought this would be a pretty cool puzzle game.Well, it's an insanely awesome puzzle game, with slider puzzle mechanics but so much more.Lots of wonderfully gruesume and excellently designed puzzles.  It reminds me of Hitman Go, which I also highly recommend.  But, it's also completely different.  Once you finish a story (level), you get deleted scenes which are MORE levels to play in that story!  What a great idea!  The humor is top notch, the poor taste oozes out of every corner of my computer while I'm playing.The puzzles range from pretty easy to extremely devious and brain burning.  You wouldn't think by looking at the small play board that these puzzles could get so crazy, but they do.  There's nothing beyond the realm of impossibility here, just a bit of frustration every now and then.  Which is a good thing.The game kicks booty.  Highly recommended."

,Recommended,530390,26326960,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,RipWitch,"""Slayaway Camp"", a purely slide puzzle game with a voxel style. With being a homage to 80s horror movies, you play various killers to terminate all teens and some cops along the way. With Halloween coming, this game is a treat to those who love puzzle games and horror movies.Slayaway Camp capitilizes on 80s movies any way they can. Each area is labeled as a 'movie' with each level labeled as 'scenes', along with a new killer that is associated with those movies and a short cinematic. After each scene, there is an extra kill which will gain you coins to buy gore packs (which has a chance to show up after killing a teen) or more killers. Movies, gorepacks (both what you have and whats in the store) and killers are displayed on shelves in their respective areas with a funny description with each. An added bonus is that there are backs to the movies, so once they are on your shelf you can click the movie box to read the back summary.It has a good difficulty curve, with the first movie being a tutorial and each new addition that affects how the puzzle would be solved has a few scenes for the player to get used to them. There will be some scenes that would probably get you stuck, but the game has a built in hint system. Recently, a skip feature has been added, however you would have to at least play the last (""boss"") level to move onto the next movie.Grinding coins is encouraged, with deleted scenes being unlocked for players to go back to previous movies and a dedicated grind movie. More is to come, as the developers make more ways to grind for coins.Overall, Slayaway Camp is a great puzzle game with 80s horror movies framing their game, anticipating what new kills and killers will look like as they unlock; while simultaneously cursing those sneaky teens that seem to not want to be killed in each puzzle."

Slayaway Camp is a slider puzzle game presented as a love letter to one of the greatest of all movie genres - the 80s Slasher film.  You play as one of a series of psychotic klllers that pay homage to a host of horror icons; mostly from 80s greats like Friday the 13th and Halloween, but with a bit of bleed-over into the 70s and 90s for good measure.  You slide around the environment, avoiding obstacles and slaughtering helpless teenagers until everyone is dead and you can make your way to the exit.Each of the 10 scenarios is presented as an 80s-era movie on VHS tape, and consists of a dozen or so ""scenes"", with another 5 or 6 ""deleted scenes"" that are unlocked when you finish the main ones.  The puzzles range in difficulty, with some being actually quite hard, but hints are available if you need them.  Each movie gives you a new iconic killer to play, and more can be unlocked with coins you earn in-game.  You can also unlock a number of execution kills that randomly play through the course of the game.  It's not too difficult to gather enough coins for unlocks, but if you want to speed things along there's a separate mini-game that let's you grind out as much as you want.I typically can't stand games with these sort of blocky, 8-bit ""retro"" graphics, but there's an exception to every rule and this one's it.  One of Slayaway Camp's greatest features is its sense of humor and tongue-in-cheek approach to the subject matter, and watching all these little teens being slaughtered in shockingly brutal ways ends up being quite hilarious when you see it in all its blocky, pixelated glory.   We get enoughrealisticbrutality in other games - this game is aboutcharming, funbrutality, and it succeeds at that brilliantly.  In fact, pretty much everything that Slayaway Camp tries to do, it does exceedingly well.  I haven't had this much genuine fun with a game in quite a while, and I wholeheartedly recommend it."

That sentence alone points to a clear sign of why you should add this game to your library: it's popular as all f*ck.Right now, according to the store page,Slayaway Campis sitting pretty with an overall score of ""Very Positive."" OK, sure, the game did just release in October, but I hope to see the game community and devs continue to grow, as well as eventually see the day that this game is listed as ""Overwhelmingly Positive."" That's the kind of game it is.Now, as Halloween is my favorite holiday, and I was in the midst of my month long rewatching of horror and slasher flicks, you can bet your♥♥♥♥♥that I bought this game, rather impulsively, within about five seconds of glancing over the store page. Let's be clear that I'm not the type to buy impulsively too much.THIS GAME IS A MASTERPIECE AND I'D EASILY BUY IT A SECOND OR THIRD TIME.I also started up the game the day I bought it, another unheard-of action from a self-proclaimed games hoarder.Slayaway Campturned out to be everything I expected, and more.It's a simple premise, a slider type voxel game  where you control the killer and zip around the levels bringing the pain to unaware victims. The game isn't too difficult, if you're worried about that, but does ramp up the stakes with things like SWAT cops to avoid, electric fences, and even teleporters. With each new ""movie"", a collection of levels, I got more and more excited to see what new elements would be thrown in to puzzle my way out of.The devs were also great and prompt about patching the game and fixing bugs, days and even weeks after the game's release. They also added some fun new content and really seemed to pay attention to what the players had to say.TL;DR: I need a Skullface plush, and will throw my money at the dev's faces if they make that happen. Also, this game has ""deleted scenes"" (extra levels) as well as NSFW scenes you can go back and play, so it's well worth your money for the content."

It never takes itself seriously and the result is an excellent puzzle game.Its casual, its fun, its relaxed; the puzzles are interesting to work out and are generally in the 'sweet spot' of difficulty (i.e. they make you feel like you achieved something without being painful (and if any puzzle is painful there is a fair hint system and they'll even give you the solution if you need it)). The mood is very much a lighthearted dark-humor, and you can't help but smile when playing it.Overall, this is a fantastic puzzle game; its funny, its cute, it delivers chuckles and intriguing puzzles.

Also the design is super cute & nostalgic with great nods to classic slashers & other horror films!If there's something I would want to add it's more than just one hint per puzzle. Plus option to show one step at a time and not the full solution in one go when it comes down to that. Also, I might have missed it, but I would like to quit or slow down the step-by-step-solution at points because when it goes by all in one go I tend to forget the first step when shown all the following. One can always watch the solution repeated times though, but it would be a bonus to only see parts or slow it down.All in all, highly recommended & brings a smile to my face!"

Soundtrack is pretty good for that however, It fits well.This game has you play as a killer and you can only go in full directions left right up or down.Players have to kill all the victims and then exit via a portal, at the end of a level you get a bonus kill scene where you can earn some extra money to spend.Money can be spent on unique fatality kills or unlock new killers too, you can also use money to get a hint for a puzzle or even get a full sequence on how to complete the puzzle too. Mind you, all of these are expensive so you'll have to pass a lot of puzzles in order to buy them, which keeps you playing.As levels progress, new features are added. there will be victims you're not allowed to kill and there will be victims who can actually kill you. You also have traps, hazards and other objects which will alter the puzzle together.Some puzzles are easy and some will get you quite frustrated. We're all different in how we think and solve puzzles in general so you'll always be challenged in some way and sometimes you'll blitz no problem.I hope they can introduce some kind of workshop support for this game. I'm up to the NC-17 videos which provide some extremely challenging puzzles and being a colourful game too with its simple graphics, I'd say its a very enjoyable game.#endorse5natch"

This little puzzle game about 80s slasher horror and B-Grade VHS movie culture is probably one of my favourite releases from this year.The puzzles are amazing with a great difficulty curve, a movie style framework that actually contributes to the theme of the game, (unlike say Alone in the Dark 2008) providing 10 different ""films"" (plus bonuses) starring a new killer each time, levels broken down into ""scenes"" and more levels unlocked when the base film is complete, those of course being your ""deleted scenes."" The game has a humourous side, most evident with the ridiculous kills done in a voxel graphical style, and while oft-overused fits the mood of the game well. There's a good deal of content to unlock through gorepacks, killers, new films, deleted scenes, and other such bonuses.It's a great Halloween/horror game that isn't another dime-a-dozen jumpscare fest made in Unity, and deserves far more attention than it's gotten.

The victims are always funny and charming to see brutally murdered (More on that in a second)The level design is also top notch, sometimes it'll be a bit frusterating but in a good way, it makes you think and outsmart the victims. Sometimes you'll need to scare them away, and sometimes you'll need avoid killing animals like cats.Now, the amazing kills - Every kill feels like it was created by Tom Savini (Although he's working for Friday The 13th: The Game right now), every time you kill a victim after scartching your head thinking about how to kill the other victims is so satisfying to watch, and there are mini games between each level so you can get points to get new kills and killers, and if you are lazy like me you can spend them to get hints or even skip the level. Which is great since the minigames are really easy and fun.The amount of content is big, especially for 8$, I'm in Part 5 (Every part is between 12-24 levels) and I think there are at least 8 Parts and pretty sure more are coming + there is some side activity and a high replay value.Conclusion: This game is one of the best games I played this year and easily the best indie game I ever played.

Slayaway Camp is a puzzle game like no other...lots of humour .. real creative puzzles and a sort of happy blood theme if is there is such a thing.

,Recommended,530390,26252539,"Posted: 27 October, 2016",all,Dramamine,"Slayaway Camp is a love letter to the 80's slasher movies presented in a gory voxel-puzzle game.I'm pleasantly surprised with this game. I bought it on a whim just looking for something casual to play in-between bigger achievement hunting projects. I'm not the biggest puzzle game fan; it's not that I don't enjoy them, but I usually get bored trying to figure out the solution. I'm also not a huge fan of horror, although I'd classify this as horror-comedy. The game also does have a lot of voxelated gore; but there appears to be a slider that changes the amount of bloodshed and bones you see; with the option to increase or lower the amount.The difficulty curve in this game has been fair, for the most part. The odd puzzle will present itself as a bit more tricky and involved than some before or even after; but they're usually solved fairly quickly. There's only one puzzle so far that had me stuck and ended up using a hint to help solve. After the game gives you a hint, it has an option to auto-solve the puzzle for you for a small amount of the skull tokens you use to buy Gore-Paks and skins for Skullface.The game has a wide-variety of bonus kills and Gore-Pak kills. You get a free skin every movie you start; as well as being able to buy some through a Mystery Box feature. These skins (so far) also seem to have some skin-specific kills, and some levels also have level-specific kills. I can't say whether the Mystery Box skins have any skin specific kills yet as I've mostly been focusing on buying the Gore-Paks since some of them are more expensive.This is a good puzzle game to pass the time with. There's a great amount of levels, as well as a solid amount of variety with new kills to witness, skins to see, movies to unlock that features different types of worlds, and new level hazards as you progress.If you're a fan of puzzle games, horror, or just looking for something to pass the times with, this is a great buy. Even if you're not a huge fan of either, I'd still recommend giving this game a chance. If you're still unsure about the game, you could always check out the free version on Kongregate to help see if it would be something you enjoy."

It has a good difficulty curve with some levels being rather frustrating, but if you get completely stuck there is an option for the game to show you the solution. An option I initially ignored until I became completely stuck on a level in the 5th movie (I was just approaching the start slightly differently but meant I got stuck trying to get the last teenager).Encourages you to grind for coins to unlock new kills and character skins. This is actually enjoyable.Overall I do recommend this indie game. Its funny and cheap. Should give at least 10 hours of game play from the look of it.Pros:Well designed puzzle mechanics which keep being added to throughout each movie.FunnyDoes a good job with the horror genre setting.It includes cats (sure they are a pain, but who can dislike cats?)Cons:Puzzles at times can be a bit frustrating as the difficult increases, but thats more due to me playing for the horror parody than purely for the puzzles."

It captures the campy silly feel of a B-movie horror flick with some well though out puzzle mechanics. You start out just having to figure out how to reach and slash victims (with random Gore close-up kills), and quickly moves into the idea of controling victim location with their fear mechanic, where if you end a move adjacent, or kill a victim adjacent to them they will make a move in the opposite direction. They do a good job of expanding these mechanics as they go, introducing for instance traps that kill those you move into it, or land mines you may have to get victims to activate to get where you need to, or objects that can be knocked over to crush victims or simply change the map, or light switches which make victims no longer run away, or adding cops who can arrest you if you end directly in front of them, or swat teams who will shoot you dead if you end a move in their lazer sight (and can only be killed when the lights are out), or the dasterdly cats who must not be killed for  fear that the overzelous canadian censorship board will ban the movie completely. The introduction of mechanics is well paced, and each of games levels (styled as the sequals of this horror movie franchise)  has its own little arc that ends on a comparitively difficult level surrounding the use of some enviromental murder device (be it the woodchipper, rollercoaster, bandsaw...etc). Finally the game has multiple layers of additional challenges beyond the base levels, first off with the 'deleted scenes' and eventually the NC-17 content, which you unlock after the last movie which seems to remaster the most memerable puzzles from a movie but with the end game mechanics. The only complaints I have are minor compared to what is good about this game. One of these is that getting all of unlockable cosmetics (the gore packs for more variety in the close-up kills, and additional killer skins) take a lot more grinding than is necessary. The fact that there is a money grinding movie/minigame seems a bit out of place for the whole puzzle game experience of the rest of the game. Also the hint system for when you get stuck could have a bit more nuance, the one time I used it gave a hint too vangue to even resemble useful, and the only other hint it had was to fast forward through the entire puzzle (which is only for when you have given up on the puzzle and never want to deal with it again).TLDR: Good puzzle game with charming B-movie Horror aethetics and great pacing, with only minor complaints."

New mechanics are introduced regularly, you spend 2 or 3 puzzles getting your head around them, another 4 or 5 feeling pretty smug about mastering them, and then just as you might be on the verge of starting to feel it's all gotten a little dull there's a new mechanic and another devilish reinvention of an old one to test you again.Those mechanics aren't just dry challenge-enhancers either, they're fun, well-animated riffs on all sorts of horror movie tropes that always raise a smile. In fact the whole thing is wrapped up in a nice retro-styled 'video-nasty' presentation that proves the retro aesthetic isn't quite completely wrung-out just yet, as long as it's done well and in service of a good game.Slayaway Camp is funny without trying too hard, endearing without being cutesy and irreverent without being annoying.

The animations are great and every blood splattered blocky death is done with humour and great animation. The puzzles, whilst some simple , some are not so obvious and sometime you kill the last person with a smile on your face thinking you have completed the level, only to find you are now stuck and can’t reach the exit, at which point you can use the rewind feature, that takes you back through your steps one at a time, allowing you to continue from any point in the level, this is animated like an old VHS tape rewinding. The way the puzzles are constructed and the need to position some victims in the level by such mechanics as scaring them in a certain direction, or getting their attention with a ringing phone, ensure that the way the puzzles are solved is in keeping with the theme of the slasher movie genre.A great game, reasonably priced and fun to play. Exactly what a game should be."

Slayaway Camp, at it's core, is the tried and true ice-sliding puzzle, where pressing a movement key pushes you as far as you can go in that direction. Your objective is to murder all the people (except the cops) by moving into them, then getting to a designated exit point.Moving into a person kills them, but leaves you stationary, potentially leaving you in a row or column of the grid you couldn't otherwise access. So, the position of people becomes important. People will also run away from you if you occupy a square adjacent to them, or kill someone who is adjcent to them, and they will run in the opposite direction as far as they can go. So, we get, in addition to the ice sliding puzzle, a block pushing game, but one where the blocks can't directly be pushed! Often the trickiness in the puzzles arises from deftly manipulating the scared people into being in the exact position you want them to be. Although, some of the puzzles have a limited number of moves, so the challenge is in being efficient.Slayaway Camp's learning curve is quite gentle. Over its hundreds of puzzles, it drips down several new mechanics, and always presents an easy puzzle or two that forces you to explore the implications of the new mechanic. The overall difficulty increases gradually, and it may take 60-90 minutes before a more seasoned puzzle game player begins to feel the challenge. But, rest assured, the puzzles do become challenging, and remain that way for the majority of this surprisingly lengthy game.What's more, they are definitely the good kind of challenging. I rarely found myself wandering aimlessly to see what I could accomplish. My method for solving a new puzzle was to dive in and see what I could accomplish. Then the difficulties of the level would present itself (How can I get to the exit? How do I get that last teenager in the middle of the room? etc). More often than not, by working backwards from these difficulties, I could figure out a blueprint for what I needed to get done, and in what order. It was a fun, intellectual experience, rather than a frustrating experience of headbutting a brick wall until it cracks (although, some of the move-limited puzzles were more like this).I highly recommend Slayaway Camp. It's extraordinary value, and the developers have clearly crafted it with both love and skill. Speaking of the developers, they are highly responsive both to bug reports and suggestions for future expansions. Do yourself a favour and pick it up."

Much to my surprise, however, there's a very good puzzle game in here under the simple cubist graphics and cheesy-just-to-be-cheesy farcing of the 1970s-80s ultra-campy slasher/splatter movies.  This is actually quite a legit sliding puzzle game and you get a couple hundred of them.  The puzzles get more and more complex as you go along, adding new elements that force you to devise new solutions and plan your moves well in advance.  But despite this, most puzzles are just the right size, not too long or too short.  It's just that instead of something like an elf picking up gems or whatever, it's a psycho killer painting the walls with blood and leaving body parts strewn about the floor.The game's levels are called ""movies"", of which there are about 13.  Within each ""movie"",  there are 12-16 ""scenes"" which are the puzzles.  After completing a ""movie"", you unlock it's ""deleted scenes"", which are 5-7 additional and fairly challenging puzzles.  Each ""movie"" stars a different killer and introduces new puzzle features.  Usually the 1st 2 or 3 puzzles are very simple to make sure you understand the mechanics of the new features, but then you really have to start thinking.  Much of the solving process ultimately involves herding victims and arranging movable obstacles into specific places to let you not only kill all the victims but avoid traps and then reach the level's exit, all while avoiding police and not harming innocent animals.Periodically, as you kill victims, short cut-scenes play showing a spoof of some classic slasher movie death scene. (you can click to skip these if you want).  A lot of the achievements revolve around unlocking new cut-scenes, which you do by buying them in the store.  You get a few coins for completing a puzzle, with a short, simple ""click-at-the-right-time"" thing to get a few more.  You can then spend these on a selection fo cut-scenes, which are called ""gore packs"".  You can also spend the coins on unlocking new random killers besides those who appear naturally in each ""movie"".  But none of this is essential to actually doing the puzzles, it's just a way to get into the whole splatter movie vibe plus collect achievements if you're into that.Anyway, the puzzles are good and the presentation is funny.  Get it."

So many memories brought back right away.  For a puzzle game I am totally impressed with how addictive they can be.

The catch is, you can only move in straight lines, so you can't directly walk over to the victims, you have to figure out how to get to them, making this the puzzle game that it is. Each new movie introduces a new mechanic or obstacle that can help or be a pain to get to the victims and kill them. The music is also pretty cool and fits well with the situation, and it's too bad I can't find the OST on YouTube or in the files because I'm a noob when it comes to computers.My only real complaint is that sometimes the puzzles are cryptic or too hard, and the next movie or scene they're so easy it's unbelievable. It's probably just me, though, I'm an idiot.So is it worth the asking price? In my opinion, yes, it is. It's a fit for anyone who wants a challenging puzzle game and also likes murdering people.

This throwback to the slasher movies of the 80's absolutely does justice to the genre while simultaneously satirizing it to great appeal.  Instead of being a straight-up ""survive the madman"" horror game, this game spins that around to where you are a cute voxel murderer cheerfully plowing through scores of victims in the most over-the-top ways possible.  The puzzle mechanics, aesthetics, and extra content all blend together to create a unique slasher experienceGameplayMechanics-wise, this is first an foremost a puzzle game.  You are a killer sliding around a puzzle map, navigating obstacles, avoiding cops, killing generic victims and escaping through your satanic portal (yes, you heard me correctly) to move on to the next puzzle.  Normally this would get old fast, but thankfully the game keeps things fresh by introducing different mechanics throughout the game.  This makes the game more interesting, not to mention vexingly harder, as you progress, especially when different mechanics start being combined to create some of the most difficult puzzles I have every seen.However, the game doesn't explain very well how some of the mechanics work or affect other mechanics, like how lights affect the cops or telephones affect cats.  You will almost always die several times learning how the mechanics work before completing the puzzle.  For those that prefer this type of experiential learning, it won't matter.  But for those of us who prefer not being virtually set up for failure, it's annoying.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the bonus game at the end of each puzzle.  You get to try and earn an extra kill by timing a button press to land your sliding marker in the ""Kill Zone.""  It's a neat little distraction, and it earns you coins to spend in the shop.  More on that later.AestheticsThis game looks and sounds like bits were ripped out of every 80's slasher movie known to man and Frankensteined together.  While primarily based on Friday the 13th, you'll find nods to Jaws, The Ring, H.P. Lovecraft's work, and even Mars Attacks!  All of it brought to life effortlessly through the voxel-style art direction.  Even the menus are made up to look like those VHS video stores where one used to rent slasher movies from.The soundtrack's pretty awesome, too.  Sure its got those stereotypical (and very well done) horror underscores, but it even remembers to include the cheesy 80's rock songs that accompany every slasher movie ending credits.And the kills.  Oh my word, the kills.  Every kill imaginable (and previously unimaginable) is shown in glorious over-the-top fashion.  I have never laughed so hard at saxophone slayings or death-by-deep-fried-sugar.Extra ContentThere are two different types of unlockable extras - killers and kills.  Killers cost 1000 coins each (from winning those extra-kill mini games) while kills cost between 1000 and 2000 coins.  There is a large variety of kills you can pick from, but killers are earned by opening a ""mystery box"" and randomly winning a killer.  This irks me because I really wanted one of the killers (The JimSaw Killer) but as of yet haven't attained him.My other minor gripe is that once you purchase a kill, you can't preview it in the store.  You have to either wait until it randomly appears in the game, or move over to the trophy shelf.  It just seems unnecessary to have the extra steps.  I dunno, maybe I'm just crazy.There are other extras included, but I think I'll leave them for you to learn about on your own.In ConclusionDefinitely worth getting for any fan of puzzle games or 80's slasher flicks.  It's great in both regards and stands out heads above other puzzle games because of that seamless blend.What else is there to say but ""Love is Like a Machete to the Heart""Final Verdict: 9/10Note: This review is done for the Steam Awards 2016's ""I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award"" award.

Just like any good puzzle game, the game's mechanics start off super simple and get increasingly complex (as traps, stacking and scaring victims, and the authorities get involved) the further along you go making for some pretty serious head scratchers toward the end.Lots of unlockable characters and even more unlockable death sequences (little animated bits that play during/between levels).Enjoyed the puzzle mechanics and enjoyed the developer's genuine affection for 70s/80s slasher movies. For an under-$10 indie game, it has a ton of content (hundreds of puzzles) but if you want to just do the main ""story"" content, it won't take you more than 8-10 hours.Only knocks on the game I would say are the Minecraft-y look which was initially a turnoff for me but that's probably a selling point for some people and there seemed to be too many levels where there was essentially one solution which made it very trial and error. Still... definitely recommended for fans of smart puzzle games and double recommended if you also enjoy the campiness (no pun intended) of old 80s slasher movies."

""Take out"" any of your... ""Targets"" the game has a chance of displaying a cutscene, at times one that can be reproduced by frightening people away from you leading them into traps (fires, holes in the ground, water tombs filled with cocodriles, etc...) altho in most cases it will simply reproduce a random cutscene of a massive set of dozens of them that are quite characteristic and that can be multiplied repeatedly by spending coins that you earn in-game.At the end of each level (in a set of them) you can earn currency by completing a time event in a cutscene in which your character will be murdering an individual, then you'll earn ""coins"" that you can then spend either in more killers that you can select and use in the numerous of films/levels, or alternatively in more animations for the random executions that are displayed when murdering your ""enemies"".The game for the most part it's quite self-explanatory, and it has an almost perfect learning curve, I would compare it to something like Hitman Go, but I feel, as much as I love that game, this game has it's own unique aspects in it's core game design that need to be shared, and for good reason, most of them, even after attempting a level multiple times, never really frustrated me as muchs as in other game's ""personal"" failures, could have, Hitman Go being a perfect example of this.Instead the game offers a really cool ""mechanic"" to not call it ""feature"" that allows you to not only revert your mistakes resetting your position to the last movement you made, but also the ability to display handy tips for the shy price of just a couple of your in-game coins, if you still can't figure things out, after your second payment for tips, the solution for the level will be revealed.Overall i'm really pleased as well as surprised by the ammount of quality, and content there is for this game, it's an actual fleshed out release, and even then, the game feels as just another small, maybe kind of try, and see how it is, during a sale, type of title, lost within the vast Steam store library of games, I feel as if it doesn't only deserves more attention, as much as it deserves much more significant exposure on the part of the ""marketing deparment"" in itself, altho maybe there's not much it can be done to promote core gameplay aspects of a game that appears rather ""simplistic"" at first and yet internally, profoundly, it helds an amazing ammount of passion, and heart.Good ridance, good ridance indeed."

And you can earn lots and lots of different killers. It even will show you the solution to puzzles your stuck on for in-game money. The game engages in constant affectionate slasher movie parody without going so far it looks stupid or like it has a self-loathing complex.The Bad: The way you grind coins actually requires reflexes, the hints are not as helpful as they could be. Also, the game's target demographic is very narrow, only people who have watched slasher movies before the era of self-awareness would get all the jokes. The game could use more options, like replacing the cats with dogs or deliberately bad picture and audio for that 'old vhs' feel. Also, its a trifle too counter-intuative at times how to solve some puzzles.Overall, I give it a 9/10. I want more, but what is there is excellent. Only the lack content and sneaking supsicion the game is just an evil plan to get people who hate puzzle games to play a puzzle game keep me from giving it a perfect score."

I normally don’t buy games on the platform as my PC isn’t very powerful and there are only a few games that ever get my interest. But after seeing a review of this game and really liking the aesthetic and puzzle based gameplay, I decided to pick it up.The cheesy horror theme is one of the games strongest selling points, which remains present in all parts of the game. The soundtrack is also superb! The gameplay itself has a good learning curb to it. It gets pretty difficult later in the game, though the “hint” option provides genuinely useful information for a small amount of in game currency, and for a larger amount they will show you have to complete the puzzle. Plus the selection of killers and Gorepacks (kills) is pretty extensive.The way to earn money is a bit of a grind, not helped by repetitive kill animations for the bonus kills. However, I have little doubt the developers could add more in a future update, as they have been updating regularly and are listening to the community.Overall, I’m having fun with it and have no regrets about buying the special edition (because that soundtrack was worth it!). I wish the developers all the best for the future of this game!"

I didn't have high expectations of this game but after playing it I was completely amazed at how fun and addicting it is.  I'd also like to point out that it has an awesome soundtrack that has been stuck in my head.I can't recommend this game enough to my friends/family.  Not since Shovel Knight and Road Redemption have I played an idie game that has such high replay value.

I would like to work on it.Listen.No seriously, listen.This game, is ♥♥♥♥ed up. You are a serial killer, going around, killing kids and cops.BUT its all a movie!...Its still ♥♥♥♥ed though >.>Anyhow.The game is played on a small platform that varies in size and shape due to the obstacles on the map. Around the map victims are being placed in their spots just like the obstacles to give you a fairly interesting puzzlegame. How you move is simple: You go in one direction and slide until you hit something. May that be wall or kid. Sounds easy right?Well, it is a puzzle game. And the further you get, the harder IT gets as well. Some puzzles have a really easy way to solve it but the map is build so you dont actually get this right away. I was sitting there, my brain exploding multiple times. And that is where the next feature comes in handy. The hint and walkthrough feature.This game can give you a hint for 25 coins that you earn by performing bonus kills after mostly every level. You do NOT have to buy them with actual money. There isnt even a way for that. Back to the point: You can buy a hint with 25 coins. However these hints, for some maps, are not allways that helpfull. If you request more help you can buy a walkthrough of the level for 100 coins. Granted, the coins are fairly easy to come by so you could cheat your way through some brainbreaking levels. I recommend not to do this though. It isnt as fun~With the coins you can also buy new things inbetween the ""movies"". You can by ways to kill the victims and different killers. The latter however is only made available through a randomized system. You can pay a thousand bucks for a giftbox and in this box is a random killer. Hello Overwatch.And that is really all about it.A sliding puzzle disguised as a ♥♥♥♥ed up serial killer. Literally."

The game screen can get a little busy and, as a result, all those chunky voxels can become a bit visually overwhelming in some of the levels where there are several different puzzle elements in play at once. Thankfully the game does let you zoom out from the default isometric view to an overhead camera that's much better for surveying the playfield and planning out your moves. Just don't forget to zoom back in to see all of the glorious violence!And that's pretty much all I have to say about the game that could possibly be construed as negative. Slayaway is one of those rare games with such a tight focus on familiar premise and simple design that it's difficult to find fault with if you enjoy the genre. Some of the puzzles will give your noodle a proper thrashing, and the plethora of unlockables will keep slasher flick fans coming back for more. There's an impressive amount of content on offer here, especially considering the price.I should note that the game is clearly designed with mobile platforms in mind, but this PC version is very well thought out to the point that you're not likely to even notice. The SE is reasonably priced and comes with some really cool extras including a few papercraft templates for Slayaway characters that I have every intention of putting together and displaying alongside my other game memorabilia.Until Traveller's Tales decides it would be a great idea to make an M-rated Lego Friday the 13th game (which will sadly never happen), Slayaway Camp is about the best you could hope for. Murder has never been so hilariously adorable."
