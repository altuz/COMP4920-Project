,Recommended,530560,32062414,Posted: 30 May,all,[TB] Byron,"This is a review of an early access game. It is rough around the edges; the UI needs work, and a lot of visuals are unpolished. The playable map itself is too small an area. There is no hiding that it feels like it is in late alpha stage, but these things are to be expected.Underneath the rough exterior is a real gem of a game. I really enjoy the depth of crafting this game offers, it's not easy, but it is complex.This is a unique treat for any fans of the steampunk genre, because it is just dripping in it. Nowhere else offers a place where you can create and live in such a detailed steampunk world. I personally look foward to the day I can create my own airship. This is a must buy for any steampunk fans out there!"

There is the alignment system and in some servers there is judgement hour, both work like in Lif.Combat system is flawed and sometimes a pain.The crafting is simple, just click on show all and you just have to hover the mouse to see what skill level you need and click on them to see what materials you need, also L is your friend, in doubt about crafting press L.The game has a simple tutorial that will teach you the basics, access to it pressing F1. You can personalize your UI how you like it with f10.And finally, for the love of god, you are not in a leash; experiment, click on things to see what they do, explore, look it up on google or in the community, but this is a game about experimenting and creating, you set your own goals.Overall the game is really fun, you just have to be patient and curious, if you want something about you where you gotta earn the stuff you want and do it with hard work and dedication, this is your game. If you want something easy that spoon feeds everything to you, this aint for you."
,Recommended,530560,32123503,Posted: 2 June,all,Alexander (Aterdux),"TL;DR Fun if you like complexity, challenge and research mechanics. Not going to work for casual gamers who unfortunately became the majority.This game is a pleasant surprise for me. I probably like it for the wrong reasons but I am so sick and tired of streamlined games where everything is explained and so easy that challenge in Steam Hammer is a very welcome change. Trying to figure out what to do, how things work, explore the world and game mechanics struck a right chord in me. Somehow all this figuring out reminded me of complex strategies where you don't start from simple things and have to read up a lot until you know what to do. If you like good old hardcore games, this might be right up your alley. Also, I spend almost an entire hour walking around and looking at everything - it was like a meditation with very nice music.That's all for plusses. As for minuses, it's a bit tedious. I see in other reviews that not everyone seems to like it but for me it's again not so bad, maybe for my deep dislike of easy games."

If you've played Life Is Feudal: Your Own and you enjoy the idea of airships, jetpacks and giant hammers with a dab of gunpowder in the mix then this is for you. Of course there's a few kinks that need work but it's a pretty new game. Give it time."

Currently it's not worth the 28 €.Cons:- The map feels kinda empty and is missing details- Animation and sounds not matching sometimes- Very slow paced (like LiF:YO)- Blackscreen of Death when playing in fullscreen and trying to Alt+Tab or when generating a new world- No female character-models yet. The 4 available male-faces are ugly af! 2nd race not really implemented (also not going to win any beatuy competitions)- unmoveable progressbar right in the middle of the screen :OPros:- Steampunk setting- Crafting and building- has multiplayer ;)Wait a little bit longer before purchasing :)"

76561198038570177,Recommended,530560,32880156,Posted: 27 June,all,Ryder,"This review is only for a single player experience.I'm only a few hours in.SH has a deep crafting system. It's reasonably polished, but feels slightly clunky somehow. Some resources are also more deeply defined than most games, where a resource, like wood, may be of varying quality and yield different amounts of wood and timber.Time to accomplish a task is metered... and to me seems unbalanced currently. For example, it takes about as much time to cut a log by a soft (copper) hand saw, as it takes with an iron bladed table saw.  For realisms sake, a table saw should be about 10x faster.BUGSCrafting is a little buggy at times.  If you close the crafting window during the craft, you don't get the item, even though the time (and fuel) used to make it are consumed.I've recently found that the furnace lighting procedure can result in closing the crafting window.  That's past frustrating.The terraforming tools are shockingly ineffective, and making a patch of level ground is difficult to impossible anywhere where the ground isn't nearly flat perfectly flat to begin with. I think the devs really need to rethink this entire part of gameplay.I Recently found oranges, but could not pick them.Perhaps this is not a bug, but I found that weather frequently turns to crap, and stays that way.  It may be that you log in with certain weather conditions, randomly chosen (and not held over from the last save). The weather seems to stubbornly remain the samethroughout the session.So far, I like it... bugs aside, progress can be made.Looking forward to more updates."

Fanboys with no concept of how game development from small studios works start claiming the sky is falling and the project is doomed.Don't believe the hype. Steam Hammer received a recent small patch, and the developers have spoken up in the forums to squash these silly rumors.  The game is still under development. Go ahead and buy it and know the project is new and being attended to.I'm going to recommend this game to any fan of sandbox/crafting games. Of course it's in alpha and there are issues. That's to be expected with every early access title. Steam Hammer wasn't kidding when it says that it's a ""hardcore"" game. The U.I. is a bit complicated at first. Crafting and collecting resources takes longer than other titles in the genre. Steam Hammer is more about staking a claim, making a clan, building a self sufficient town for your clan members to control and operate out of. Then potentially battling with other clans for control of a map area using Victorian era rifles and air-ships. There are some ""pre-made"" structures on map that can be claimed as your own. Sounds like fun to me :)I will update this review as time goes on, but over-all I'm happy I supported the project and I do not regret the purchase.Keep in mind this is VERY Early Access. 6/10 at the moment. Worth a buy.Pros:-Great Steampunk themed concept.-Nice ambience.-Hardcore gameplay that's more adult based.-Teamwork in multiplayer is crucial to dominate.-Claiming land and maintaining it is cool!-Very small yet friendly community. Mostly European so far.-PVP is possible, yet murder carries penalties.-Deep RPG elements for your character.-Bioware/KOTOR/Mass Effect style alignment system.-Elder Scrolls: Morrowind style levelling where you level up what ever skill you use.-Terraforming. Shape the landscape.-Many interactable items.-Weather affects growth of crops. Deeper gameplay concepts.-Host your own server, clans, etc.-Reasonably priced considering you could waste years in-game.Cons:-The day and night cycles are too long. About 1 hour = 12 hours in game.-The U.I. is a bit clunky compared to other games.-There is clipping issues through the ground that will kill your character... at the moment.-It's possible to get stuck in very shallow holes you can't jump out of.-Crafting stations break too easily and are too expensive to repair.-Slower paced than other games. Requires patience and devotion.-Not really suitable for younger kids. Very complicated gameplay.-I have encountered a crashing issue server-side. But it fixed itself.-Sometimes it's difficult to interact with objects because the wrong menu pops up.-Many servers were removed due to low population. No NA servers at all.-Map is somewhat too small.-Crafting some items takes too long. 15 seconds or more easily.-Crafting recipies could be more clear.Upvote this post to spread the truth to others. Games like this only get better with support. This is a title you could perceivably get addicted to and play for years just like MineCraft or Space Engineers. With some good updates and bug fixes, Steam Hammer has good potential."

Maybe its more realistic that i have to repair a wood saw after sawing roughly 100 boards, but its definitely not fun. Also I'm pretty sure a saw could cut more than 100 log but maybe thats cause it was a low grade saw...idk. The repair kits to repair your buildings feel useless. seems like i'd need like 5 to repair one. might as well build a whole new work bench. tooks break fast at low lvls but seem to get better in quality as you go. The in game help needs major work but that was expected. Find herbs was hell until i learned to turn ground clutter off by lowering grass loading range. After my smelter and workbench both broke at the same time I decided i was done until they polish a bit more. Lots of potential but not a lot of fun. Building stuff is fun. Upkeep is not. Compared to other games in the genre, like ark, or empyrion (omg potential on that one), it just feels like they need to tweak a few things. Also how do like 5 pounds of materials become a 55 pound repair kit? Alchemy skill too high? Also they stopped working, even after repaired.I purchased the game because the genre seems fun. Airships and etc. But I feel it would share the same problem as ark on a official server. Lots and lots of time invested for very little overall pay out. The good news is that most of the obvious pitfalls the game has could be corrected easily in time. Heres hoping the people running the show, run it right. Will not recommend atm but thats subject to change. I think i'm a lil salty still after finishing a big building, hitting build...then all my materials disappearing and it wanting me to start again."

There is alot of grind involved, but that actually makes it feel special when you build your first house, or even city. The bugs are there, which is typical for early access games, so nothing special in terms of the overall programming, but it's alot of fun, if you have patience. I would recommend playing with a friend or two, though."
,Recommended,530560,31710155,Posted: 12 May,all,Arcanith Lionheart,"This game uses the same engine as the Life is Feudal does, but just for the fact that it has working Steam Powered Zeppelins it already tells the dedication put into this. Still alpha and a lot of things could be worked on here, but at least it shows how progress is done. Not to mention, Early Access Game, I am sure many changes will come to make it more unique.If you see people complain about skill cap and grind, well, that is what this and LiF is about, you grab a group of people and you build up a town. These games are also meant for small amount of people, 64 top, preferably in dedicated servers where you can control what happens in them to avoid griefing and other dubious acts, which LiF MMO will definitely have with the release of the mmo.Not to mention, LiF, come on, 3 years in development and horses cannot pull carts yet, the fanboys that started playing recently will never understand what happened in the past and the changes that have gone through the game all because they want to play the MMO. The developer is one of those that always avoid questions and confrontations by banning people that do that or giving vague replies to avoid the question or do the worst thing possible by mentioning other companies like ""We released a major patch a few months back and other companies release these as DLC"". News flash, DLC is NOT equal to Fixing Your Damn Game. Not to mention the Easter patch when the event was just to last a week, and Yesterday is when they decided to fix that.Enough about that. Steam Hammer is pretty much what you would expect from Life is Feudal a few years back, you gather, mine, farm, but the skill tree here is much simpler, not sure if anything will be added, but a 600 skill cap means you can do EVERYTHING in this game, which is not the case of LiF due to their silly skill tree system (Because a cook needs to go through farming just to be able to toss stuff into a cauldron for some reason).So grab a group of friends, join a server and get building or whatever, more fun that way, as well as to roleplay. Want to play solo with high skill progression? Might as well make your own server and raise up the settings. Multiplayer with fast skill progression? Look for one, or just get a dedicated server, just don't complain about it since it is not constructive feedback in these reviews because this type of game is not for those lacking in patience. But hey, at least combat looks more entertaining than in LiF with airships and guns. In LiF you cannot even fight properly in a horse because the developer refuses to fix things properly.I am looking foward for the continuous development of this, according to the kickstarter this game will be released by the end of this year, I just hope it will not be a big dissapointment like how LiF is.I mentioned LiF a bit too much, why? Because it has been abandoned as they solely focus on the MMO and only implement fixes and features on LiF: YO when they should have been added on release, which they rushed to score a buck or two while money grabbing with packs to beta test the MMO while the original testers of YO have just been completely flat out ignored while testing that crap for free."
,Not Recommended,530560,31706507,Posted: 12 May,all,Gary Dozer,"This is just a reskinned version of the game Life is Feudal: Your own (LiF:YO). With all negative aspects.1. It's not a massively multiplayer game. LiF never became one.2. Map is very small. Basically it's only for one or two groups of people.3. Too much grind. Do you want a steampunk airship? Well, maybe after a couple of weeks of intense grind. And only if you have someone to help you out.4. Skillsets are vague and limited. Like it's not enough just wasting time grinding your skills. There is a total skill level cap which will force you to re-grind your skills when you'll reach it. And every time when your group members will come and go.5. The gameplay is clunky and jagged. It's just doesn't feel comfortable to play.6. GUI is very primitive. With lots of different actions it's reasonable to expect some kind of customization and automation. There are none.Basically, both this game and LiF:YO are just an engine demo. This game is also an attempt to sell same junk in a different wrap for second time.Don't buy."

(which I've always felt was clunky and almost sticky to a degree.) Jetpacks and Airships handle REALLY well for a game this early into development which is great considering games that are full release on the same engine can barely handle anything that isn't a player entity.Progress doesn't feel super grindy, made it to mid tier gear on a high gather/skill gain server in about two days of work from 5 members. Airships aren't godtier endgame stuff which makes them feel accessible even to the early game (considering that you have fuel to run the bad boy). Only problem I feel is that the devs may get lost in making the airships feel too endgamey or really super powerful, making guys on the ground in armor with guns get blasted like ants with a magnifying glass, I think theyre in a good place balance wise right now.Combat feels reasonably responsive with the old mount and blade system proving time and time again the superior melee combat mechanic formulae. Guns are REALLY accurate and can blast an apple off a guys head from a mile away, no ironsights/scopes as me and my group have found through the midgame gear.Industry buildings feel abit like garbage, my group built a carpentry shop and a massive sawmill, which didnt increase the speed of our sawing and broke within half an hour of quite medium usage, feeling kind of like a waste of resources, (it looked cool tho) offering us no endgame wood/carpentry items (yet) but all in all I feel like theyre ""work in progress"" meaning they'll maybe give boosts to crafting timers later onAll around I feel like the devs have taken a good first step in getting a game like this off the ground, the steady but small updates show the devs are actually trying with it and are working on it currently.

So its not as bad as LiF which i didnt play cause the time consume on that games crazy!If you like hardcore survival, getting attacked all the time, this isnt the game for you, it centres more around, survival as if your stuck on a desert island, you have start from the basics working your way up, if you pick a good spot you can get there pretty quickly at around 50hrs this is all bymyself as well.The graphics are pretty good, all vicuals are done well with steam punkishness, which is awesome, its a green game so steam are backing it.So if you like helping games get up and going defs by this probably the best iron age survival ive played in a long time.Devs keep up the good work.To add to the people who complane about fps i run this on high and get 50-80 fps, if you cant get this your rig isnt good enough to play.i7 4.2 ghz 16gb ram 1070 8gbAlso look at hours played on reviews anything under 40hrs for this game means they havent even built a building normally."

Really bad glitches like when you try to place a house, first it tells you to level the ground (AFTER the craft bar finishes) then you level a bit and try again, WAIT for the craft window only to find out it needs more leveling done.  I played for only 1.9 hrs at the time of this review but I bought a lot during summer sell and this was 1 of many so going to try the rest, I will be back to this one as it seems like it could become a great game as long as the dev's don't do the smash and grab like so many of this genre have.In the 2 hrs I played, it took a bit to figure out the basics but I got it figured out, I played on a private server I created so I could play the game for what it is and not deal with the people mainly because these types of games tend to draw a very bad group of people that ruin games for everyone around them.Major glitch I encountered during my play was I got stuck on a mountain bump and bounced up and down over and over til I died and then lost a bunch of skill points.Everything else was typical of this type of game nothing really stands out in the early side but I hear you can build really great things later so I will be back to play more :)"

This is one of the few examples when a sandbox survival title follows any setting at all, and in this case it being Steampunk is really interesting. The execution is really good overall: the graphics are pretty, the characters and architecture are what I would expect to see in a Steampunk game. The soundtrack not only fits extremely well, but it is well written and captivating as it is. All in all, the exterior of the game is very good even though it's an Early Access title.Gameplay-wise, there's already plenty of content to♥♥♥♥♥♥around with, plenty of customization options for your own servers, and overall planty of stuff to do with your friends or on your own.

,Not Recommended,530560,31728371,Posted: 13 May,all,DATMURKELMAN,This game is a really long winded survival game that involves selecting options from a menu rather than using your tools to harvest things. It was going ok until i crafter the 5 tools that were available and realised i had nothing else to do? Also entered water for about 2seconds. Died from drowning. Wait a few months before purchase..
76561198034286355,Not Recommended,530560,32837743,Posted: 26 June,all,$teampunkKitties,I was so excited when I saw this game. But everytime I tried to launch the game it crashed with no error messages. I finally got as far as able to create a character but once again the game crashed. After several attempts at trouble shooting I finally gave up hope and had it refunded. I had read all the reviews and really struggled with the thought of buying it in this early stage but I wanted to give it a fair chance. If things turn around in the future and maybe a game demo could be released for it I would gladly give it another try.

Is it pure and hard harassment for us to leave and let the game go?"

How on earth this useless piece of junk has come out in 2017 is beyond me. Everything is so clumsy, sticky and confusing. I have been trough my fair share of survival/crafting games. This thing is so counter-intuitive. I struggle to even draw a weapon, I can equip it on my blet, but dont you dare to put your hand on it, you left klick, your right cliks. Nothing happens. After every menu there are 16 more. I have picked up games with no previous ability, but this here is not even remotely sensible. I want to puke how bad the controls are. How confusing and useless the whole game is. Please never buy this ever under no cicrcumstance. After nearly 2000 hours combined in different survival games, so far this is my worst. I wanted to build some basic stuff, could not even do it. Not that I had no resrouces, hell no. The interface is your biggest challenge. And if you die, you think like in any survival game, run back to your corpse, loot your body. Not is this steaming pile of dog dong. You get punished bad with debuff. The only thing good is the music and some of the still shots. Brrr......"

Requested a refund.  Will likely not try it again later as it already claims 4k support while that is patently not true."
