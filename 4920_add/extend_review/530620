,Recommended,530620,29451563,Posted: 23 January,all,Snort Cannon,"I'll keep this review incredibly short, as I'm planning on reviewing Resident Evil 7 and I'm aware that this entire teaser is in the actual game, so I'll keep it brief.In this teaser you play as a man who wakes up in a seemingly abandoned house. You soon find a tape and put it in a VHS player and you soon figure out that the house is not as abandoned as it seems and you have to get out as soon as possible.Most of you have already played this teaser and even gotten the Dirty Coin ending, but for those who haven't I'll explain a bit how the game works.In the demo there's no combat, but you can pick up weapons and there is an enemy, but I haven't tried to kill it. But anyways. The demo is more or less a scavenger hunt, where you look for items to escape the house and once you escape it leads to events in the Resident Evil 7.This teaser looks absolutely fantastic and the attention to detail is great, and without a doubt Resident Evil 7 looks amazing as well.To experience every possible ending you will play for at least two hours, after that there's no point in playing anymore as at that point you have already experienced everything,In the end all I can say check this out if you like horror, cause this is absolutely fantastic and I can't wait to play the main game.(won't give this teaser a rating)"

I seen my own shadow on a door and thought i was going to die, i didn't want to turn around, then i realized it was just me. I didn't read any reviews before playing so i wouldn't find any spoilers, but now that i have read some and have figured out what the teaser consists of, i think i am going to try and play it again...tomorrow...when the sun is up...and the windows are open...and the lights are on...and i burn all of my teddy bears.I recommend this game fully to anyone that loves scary stuff, but as for me... 10/10 will not be buying the full version."
,Recommended,530620,29656676,Posted: 2 February,all,EQOAnostalgia,"(I have taken the time to prepare both a short spoiler free review video, and a long in depth review video discussing all key plot points, easter eggs and questions left unanswered! The links can be found below for anyone who is interested. I put quite a bit of effort into them.)As a fan who has been there since 1996, i was one of the few people who saw in the teaser, what this game had the potential to be when it finally came out! I spent a lot of time covering the game and defending it from those who were so quick to dismiss it as a P.T. clone. In short, i have a long history with RE and RE7 so when i finally got my hands on it, and it was everything i hoped it would be, you can imagine my excitement!The game isn't without its issues however, as a second playthrough has really opened up my eyes to the fact that, some more enemy variety would have been great. Hope to see some classic BOW's in the sequel! (Copy that Capcom?!)-The graphics are very good, but some spots look ""off"" the outside areas can feel flat, and some textures just don't feel like they belong in an otherwise fantastic looking game.-Sound is fantastic, especially with headphones (no brainer) <--- see what i did there? ;) Everything sounds great, creepy sounds, bumps and creeks will keep you on edge, enemies have distinct sounds to let you know they are just around a corner, or the other room, waiting to dismember you with glee. The music is very tonal, and dynamic, it typically goes with the pace of the game, but not many of those ""iconic"" Resident Evil tracks, like for example, the RPD main hall, or Spencer Mansion basement (kek). Which is unforunate, and i can't help but feel little else but the Aunt Rhody theme and Save theme will remain in 10 years time to those nostalgic listeners. But i understand why they made that decision.-Controls are your standard first person fare, though a bit slowed down by default to match the more methodic pace they set for the game. I honestly didn't even check to see if you can adjust sensativity as it just felt right. Controller guys will be happy to know everything functions just fine in that department also.-Performance is great for most people, but some of us have had issues with stuttering on AMD processors and other hardware incompatatibilities. I had to turn things down to about medium settings, which honestly still looks fantastic, and had no issues aside from a crash here and there. Hopefully Capcom patches these things for those of us with problems.All in all i feel RE is back to what made it great! Isolation, backtracking, key items to progress, resource gathering, conservation, inventory management and a great mystery to unravel all topped with classic horror movie homages! The game will take on average, 10 or so hours to complete with plenty of reasons for a replay or two!

,Recommended,530620,29414572,Posted: 21 January,all,Redxplatinum,"I liked the demo. It had the creepy atmosphere and ambiance of RE4, exploring the unfamiliar, and bullet sponges.I hope they return to the roots of FPS. An FPS with good level design and have enough health and ammo to survive without giving them out like candy. A level design where the enemies are not just waves and waves rushing at you. Even new DOOM is guilty of this. In Duke3d, enemies are spawned in the corner of the turn to surprise you. An FPS where exploration is rewarded. Modern FPS are linear and isn't much room for exploration. Puzzles in FPS have been missing as well. Duke3d had some platforming puzzles and keycards. It's nice to see that there are keys you have to find to proceed, reminiscent of the classic fps.I also hope the 'dummy finger' things are not in the game. Something that's so vauge that players won't figure out for themselves. Interacting objects is certain orders, pointing the finger in different/random directions; it's such a hassle. But I do admit, it makes very interesting discussions, as a completionist, I would want to experience it for myself."
76561197970740493,Recommended,530620,29431829,Posted: 22 January,all,Red Cooter,"The Resident Evil 7 teaser indicates that the franchise is returning to its survival horror roots, but the game is still very different than the old Resident Evil games.Many old Resident Evil elements have returned. The RE7 teaser encourages exploration and puzzle solving. Ammo is also scarce and you are provided with limited carrying space, although you won't have to worry about maxing out your carrying space in this demo. Evading your enemy is also a better strategy than fighting them head on, which brings back the suspense of enemy encounters.The most noticeable change is the first person perspective. This view plays well, considering how small and cluttered the environments are. The first person view can be frightening because you can't see an enemy stalking you from behind. The game also uses FPS style controls, but they don't take away from the challenge. Some supernatural elements are included, which I didn't really like myself because the old Resident Evil games were more sci-fi in their approach. Of course, this is just a demo, so maybe the supernatural elements will be kept to a minimum in the full game.Despite the RE7 teaser not entirely following the formula of the original RE games, the RE7 teaser is still an enjoyable experience."

,Not Recommended,530620,29439035,Posted: 23 January,all,Lil Hooty,"I felt the need to review this in light of the constant praise it seems to get from people online.This game is being praised as the Resident Evil franchise ""returning to its roots"", a long awaited event for many fans of the classic series. After how poorly Capcom has handled the previous installments of Resident Evil, and with the addition of some really poorly made spin-off games, people have had high hopes for a return to the classic RE style of survival horror instead of action ""horror"". Sadly, after seeing the trailers and playing the demo, it seems that many people don't understand what this idea of ""going back to your roots"" actually means, Capcom included.Anyone who has played Resident Evil since its beginning knows what the games are like. RE's roots are in traditional survival horror with campy characters and dialogue that give the games a charming appeal while still maintaining a creepy atmosphere. They can be very formulaic in structure and story, but the basic mechanics and gameplay are simple. You solve puzzles, find keys and weapons, and try to avoid being killed by zombies and various special creatures strewn about the map. However, from the demo, it seems as though Resident Evil isn't ""returning to its roots"" so much as becoming an entirely different game. The mechanics feel like a cross of Outlast and Amnesia, where the focus is on the first-person perspective and groteque visuals of the environment instead of the traditional survival horror that the series is known for. The problem with the switch to first-person is that it's an easy way to abuse cliches that currently run rampant in the horror genre. Some I noticed in the demo were the use of jumpscares and the poor flashlight in exceptionally dark areas to force a sense of fear due to lack of vision. It feels as though this installment will just be using various tropes right out of currently popular first-person horror games and just become another generic first-person horror game, full of poorly done jumpscares and loosely relating to the RE franchise.The game has little to no feeling of being a Resident Evil installment outside of the title, and a blurry photo of a helicopter baring the Umbrella logo on the tail.While the basement creature has serious appeal and definitely looks like something out of the franchise, the rest of the game feels so disjointed from the franchise. I'm sure it's been said time and time again, but it just feels like RE7 is attempting to bank of the popularity of Outlast and PT, and instead of making a new IP out of it, they're slapping the Resident Evil title on it in hopes of winning over the shrinking population of RE fans that are willing to buy their games.Feel free to try the demo and come to your own conclusions, but don't go into it expecting this to be Resident Evil ""going back to its roots"" because it isn't. This is just a PT/Outlast clone with the RE title. Hopefully they'll be giving a status update on the Resident Evil 2 Remake soon."

At this point I farmiliarised myself with the housethe doors, windows and noises and began to feel a sense ofaccomplishment, ""I have done it, I'm playing a horror gamethat I'm not scared of, and I like it!"" This feeling did not lastlong however, without spoiling anything like I said, It started tohit off, with an escape looking viasable... apparently there aredifferent ending's, but i got the 'Bad ending'  so I bet you'reasking if i'm going to play it again to get a different endingI am, and bear in mind I HATE horror games, but there issomething different about this game from any other horrorgame out there, I can't put it down to one thing though,the atmosphere that is a creaky lifelike house that actually feelsalive and breathing, the  graphics are outstading, honestlyI am going to compare it to any and every other game on themarket ever, and I think IMO It is the MOST Realistic, atmosphericgame I can think of.The characters helped play a vital role in making it realthe villain or villains were briefly exciting and very fun to beafraid of, the animations and controls were fluid and stableand I was very impressed by the amount of fps I was getting, onmy GTX 1060 I never went under 60, but got almost always 70-80fps, which was incredible for a demo, I played with KB/M butwould have prefered controller if I had one, then again I doprefer the controller in general because I was born a consolepeseant, guilty as charged, So the graphics, atmosphere,characters, animations, controls and fps were outstandingthe story I can't discuss for spoiler free purposes but it wasgood too, Not groundbreaking, but just okay good... The scaryness of the game, taking all that into account, was very high,it's not very jumpscary but the atmosphere manages to reallyfrighten you, especially closer to the ending I found.In general games and considering it was a demo, 7/10If I was comparing it to other horror games I've played or seenit gets 9/10Keeping in mind this is just a demo that I played for over 2 hoursNOT the full game, which I think I'll buy.Either way this demo needs to be in your steam library if youhaven't got the full game or have some spare time,If you don't like horror games, GET ITIf you like do horror games, I'd be suprised if you didn't alreadyhave it."

The developers have shown to put lot of care and consideration into making this, Resident Evil.The sound effect is on the dot. A perfect 10/10.The developers make good used of the natural environment of the old house to constantly create a unnerving atmosphere.Don't let your ears fool you as you will be constantly looking behind your back wondering if the sound is coming from the bakers or from the unshettling environment.If you havent brought the game, I would highly suggest that you do not watch and read any playthrough or guides before attempting this. The first hand experience is surreal and mind blowing.I would say that the only regret I had is upon anxiously waiting for the game before the release, I have been keeping up with the updates on capcom's 7 and kind of spoiled myself on one of the ""encounters"" in the hallway.If you are brave enough to experience a ground breaking new horror, this is the game you absolutely need to have.The experience, 100/10."

That aside, this demo has tons of atmosphere and really gives the player a sense of total immersion. The events in this demo do not take place in the actual game (other than the video tape), and serve as a cool experience to guage whether or not a player might be interested in a deeper more narrative Retail Game experience.TLDR; Great demo/Crummy unlock conditions."

It redeems the Resident Evil title......the last 4 games were terrible....resident evil 4-7 have just bee so bad. This game is going to be amazing, i am so excited for it. I have not been this excited for a resident evil game since resident evil 2. The only reason ui could see them complaining is because they are trying to play this game on a light-bright hooked up to a computer. The people complaining are probably used to easy games where they hold your hand the whople way through the game. To any true survival horror fan you are going to LOVE this game. If the game is anything like the demo, and i do mean anything, it will be truly amazing. Now i am sure i will get some negative speak on this review, probably for my grammar or something like that. But what ever, i don't care, i am so excited for this game. This is my only review i have ever done, on anything. So that should tell you something, i was so compelled to do this review, i really hope this game does well so they keep making games like this. Games have gotten so easy and stupid over the years, withj all the hand holding and lack of consequence for your actions. I loved the first resident evil for those reasons, it was hard and terrifying. I just hope the Resuident evil fans don't ruin this game by all there complaining about not enough action or the puzzles are too hard or BS like that. I love survival horror so much, games like Outlast or Alien isolation and Amnesia are amoung my favorites, also SOMA was good. And if you are a true survival horror fan this Demo is amazing, the game comes out in like 15 hours so we will see if i was right or wrong then! OMG I AM SO EXCITED!!!!"

,Recommended,530620,30217672,Posted: 27 February,all,miezkatz,"Great teaser for everyone remotely interested in the horror genre and storywise playable before or even after playing the main game. Beginning Hour skillfully conveys the atmosphere of Resident Evil 7 and introduces every major gameplay aspect of the main game. Due to its potential for multiple endings I'd advise playing through the teaser more than once as every ending gives insights on different playstyles and a bit of lore.The ""True Ending"" though is almost impossible to find out for yourself as it involves countless hours of trial and error, interpreting obscure hints and at times arbitrary and strict sequences of actions. The reward is only worth it for people looking to perfect the main game, so it's by no means a must have or game stopper if you don't bother to get it. However, I feel it's incredibly thoughtful of the developer to integrate the possibility to transfer something into the main game, giving players an additional incentive.Playing as Clancy, the poor fool, and meeting Jack,thebadass antagonist, hints at just how overwhelmingly helpless the player feels in the rat cage that is the Baker house. There's no reason not to try Beginning Hour as a horror sympathizer."

Going back to horror is one thing but actually doing a good job of it is another, and ripping off Silent Hills, Condemned, and Outlast is just as ""Resident Evil"" as 5 and 6!"

I've always found 3rd person camera to be poorly implemented and creates frustration with wrong angle etc.The atmosphere is amazing in this demo when you play it  the first time. The house is believable and the attention to detail is quite amazing. There's however a massive flaw and this is a serious lag between the mouse movement and the screen. And i man massive... If you were to shoot or turn quickly it is just too slow. To the point you think you move underwater. It's more or less fine for puzzle solving end exploration but for the action is just unacceptable. Please fix it. It creates frustration and makes you feel really disconnected from what is going on the screen when the response to the input is so delayed. PLEASE FIX IT!

It's an experience. Not that borderline movie type of experience (likeTelltalegames and such) though. The first person perspective is a very advantaging concept, that works out optimally.

It brings back the feeling of vulnerability and the atmospheric tension of the earlier games, but with some welcome changes and improvements to the formula. Legitimately unnerving to play, just like a good horror game should be!"

76561197995881212,Recommended,530620,29724826,Posted: 5 February,all,ironandcopper,"So, here I am trying to find any possible distraction I can in order to take my mind off of the fact I have the flu, and what do I find on steam? That's right! A demo!! A demo for a triple A game in 2017! I thought demos were a thing of the past - in fact my first thoughts were A: I have to pay for it, and B: Its fake.. But nope, its real, as real as the cat who sneaks into my house at night and steals my socks (yep)..So, now for a list of things I thought were either bad or just ""meh"" - I won't put any spoilers in because that's just cruel, and also before the ""fan boys"" start bashing the proverbial excrement out of their cherry MX keys, just be aware that I liked what I saw so far, but not everything in this game is perfect.. And also I have the flu! So here I go!The bad:*Performance-It's a brand new game, and my toaster is from 2009 - so like any self respecting edjiet I cranked everything up to max and then got confused when it lagged.. BUT! And it's a big, round butt, having been gaming on PCs since I was a tidily one, I knew this was no ordinary lag, it's the type of lag that comes from software not coaxing the hardware enough for it to throttle up! It's not unresponsive, or tearing as it tries to render frames, it's just ""lag"".. So after disabling the power management for the CPUs and GPUs, the game ran like butter in a hot frying pan (with nearly everything on max!) Not so impressed so far - but it's clearly a console port, so I will let them off.. Patch it! All I can say..*Graphics-They are not that great - let's not beat about the bush, the textures are mediocre at best, and they employ a form of texture sharpening at close range similar to the old Serious Sam games, along with a myriad of blur, chromatic, distortion, grain and pixel shader filters to try and hide that fact (but hey, it worked for Condemned Criminal Origins!) Unlike other modern games (Doom 2016, Fallout 4, Wolfenstien The New Order etc) - it doesn't take up an insane amount of space relative to the size of the game and its textures, so at least there is that..*Fear Factor-Yeah, it's really not scary.. Not even in the slightest, however its very atmospheric and believable (to an extent), and that alone more or less makes up for it.. There are jump scares (though not as frequently as in the dead space series), changing environmental factors as you complete tasks (which is a cheap way of attaining a fear factor, but hey, it's been done for eons), and the industry standard appearing and disappearing peeps and freaks.. Let's be honest though, in real life you could skip the whole game by simply smashing your way out of a window and running off.. Or if you must fight, there are blunt and sharp objects everywhere (you just can't pick them up!) But it's a game, so that's pretty much irrelevant..Alright, so if you are still reading, good on you, you obviously have a longer attention span than most of my friends :)The good:*Atmosphere-Its top shelf stuff - no question about it.. Like I could actually be in that house! That could be me! From the choice of furnishings in each room, to the positioning of pictures on the walls showing the family who lived(s) <-- no, no clues! Go and play it! Baby bonnets in frames, little trinkets, rotting food items, the design of the microwave oven from the 80's, the decor, creaks and groans of the floorboards as you walk over them, dripping taps, water flowing in another room.. Did I mention the soundscape is beautifully crafted? Wear headphones, it deserves it!*AnimationThere is an animation for nearly everything - no corners cut here, everything you do is animated in 1st person, none of that ""you unlocked it"" and the padlock falls to the floor here! Nope, you either see your players hands unlock or cut the offending obstacle, or at the very least you get to see a tape being loaded into the player (might be VHS, might be an audio cassette, go play it and find out!) Hipsters love that sort of stuff!*Overall presentationThe game itself is really nicely put together, with the exception of the menus and the inventory, but since they were obviously lifted from the console version, I will try to look past that.. You are not going to be scared (unless you are really easy to scare), but you will feel connected.. Rather than fear, I personally felt warm and fuzzy, as if I was exploring a once lovely colonial era American house that has now fallen into disrepair.. In fact, I wouldn't mind having that house, gutting it, redecorating it and living there (yes, it's that much of a believable setting).. On the other hand, the game itself is very linear, I didn't really find anything dynamic going on, you have to complete A to achieve B and then C will happen.. So if you do want to get into finding alternate ""stuff"" (no spoilers!!) You will find yourself repeating the first part over and over again..Well, that's enough of my rant.. Oh and one more thing (hopefully all the fan boys have gone!) - I have every single RE game along with some consoles older than a lot of people who will be playing this, and this is NOT an RE game as far as I am concerned.. Not because of the sudden change in perspective, but because of the way it feels.. It really did remind me of Condemned rather than Resident Evil - but what can you do..Ah yes, here are the specs of my super duper toaster from 2009:2 x AMD Opteron 2439 SE (12 cores total @ 800MHz ~ 2.80GHz)4 x 4GB DDR2 800 ECC REG1 x Tyan S2915-E1 x Nvidia GTX 690  <--- Not from 20091 x Creative Labs X-Fi Extreme AudioIf I can run it on max, I am sure you can too - just need to fiddle with those power management settings ;)"

76561198284341147,Recommended,530620,30114745,Posted: 23 February,all,Strange is Life,"This game is one of my top 3 games this year of 2017, I was really skeptical at first and thought this would be a silent hill knock off, But I was dead wrong the low anticipation that I had for this game in the beginning made me love this new outlook and approach that capcom is taking making the resident evil series not another 3rd person call of duty shooter but a 1st person outlast, amnesia, and aliens isolation type of game and so much more. With its story and boss battles that keeps you at your toes that leaves you wanting more I am very glad I did not let my prejudices take me over and bought the game its full retail price. Money well spent for 9/10 game which left me very satisfied with my purchase. Even though there were only 10-14 hours of gameplay it was well worth it, don't let other people  tell you this game is not worth it because obviously they have not either played this or are way over their heads that capcom decided not to make leon or any other character from the resident evil franchise take part in this one.  With Capcom's new engine they are taking the right step of making one of the best resident evil horror type games to date. And I willingly support there new approach and is excited about what the part of the resident evil series capcom has to offer."

If the game was intended to terrified you, well they did a hella job for that. The spookiness of the house is top notch. It's fun just to walk around and tried to solve the misteries and find all of the items that are well hidden.The game didn't have a story. Well, there is a story, but it's so short and.. lame.The graphic is pretty amazing. The detail and stuff was so clear. The sound also makes you feel like you are in the game."
