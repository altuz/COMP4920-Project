It downloads files from random file-share sites so you'll never be sure it's secure (man-in-the-middle-sharing). ATM 3 of the links game gives, those site's don't work.

Yes, the game is short (3 hours in my case), but that doesn't make it any less interesting.A word of caution to non-native English speakers though: your capacity to understand spoken English over a low-quality signal may or may not slow down your progress. Same for your keyboard configuration. There's a puzzle that took me over 30 minutes to understand _how_ to input the required keys, because apparently the default way of inputing those keys on my keyboard was not the expected answer. I'll classify those as ""localization"" issues and they should not halt your progress, thanks to the community. However, be careful when going to forum so as not to get spoiled.This game rely heavily on external resources like dropbox or mediafire. That is a very interesting concept for sure and change the way you ""play"" a game. I even had to install a program on my computer to solve a puzzle, that a first for me! However, story-wise it is unclear why those files would be hosted there. From a story perpective, it would make more sense if the person you are talking to would avoid corporate firewalls by sending you things through these media, however that's not the case. What you'll grab from these external resources are ""highly-classifed"" data that should have been hosted on their internal network. Kind of weird.Another puzzle goes through an external resource where there's a mix of curated content and user-uploaded content. That is dangerous. I hope no one uploads false leads into there, but I suspect that it already happened. For the same puzzle, the developer didn't seem aware of two different ways of displaying an information, leading to much confusion in the user group. I don't want to spoil, so I'll use an analogy: the puzzle requires you to input a temperature and gives you a field like [__] F.  Out of that, you would think that it's expecting fahrenheit, but no, it's expecting Celcius. This is not an actual game puzzle, it's just to give an idea of the mismatch between the two ""formats"".Overall, I enjoyed the games but I had to go to the forums too often. The ideas are great, but if the realisation of those ideas had been a bit more polished, it would have been truly awesome.I do hope that the developer takes the time to polish these few puzzles. Not to make them easier to find out the answer, but to make it easier to get pass them once you have the answer. (Like any puzzle, the fun is in finding the key -- not loosing an hour to understand how to use the key).I would recommend the game to Amercians/Enligsh users who won't stumble on not-puzzle-releated stuff. For international user: wait for a patch or understand that your experience will suffer (but very slightly)"

But the execution just doesn't do it for me.  The conversations you have in the chat window feel very forced:  there are no choices (at least none that I encountered) and the writing varies between bad and just OK.  The thing that really bothered me was that the game starts asking you to use a real web browser to get information to proceed in the game.  I don't know why the decision was made to include something like that, but it seemed intrusive and unpleasant to me."

I just finished it a few mins ago, and there are a lot of things I like about it and a few things I think could have been done a bit better..I really like the overall feel of the game, and having actually used Windows since 3.0 in the early 90's I can say this has the ""feel"" of Windows 95.  Some people have complained about the real world ties like Mediafire, email, youtube, Google Maps (which I never could get the right coordinates with..  I had to get them from Bing Maps, and PLEASE do not consider that an endorsement of Bing, as I loathe it as a search engine..)  I actually like that you have to go outside the game for resources, but I think they should all be on a host controlled by the game devs..  The game files will eventually get taken down and someone might put malicious files for people to find..  This way is far too open to external abuse.  Also, the Mediafire site attempted to force me into dowloading one of the many ""PC Optimizer"" trojans out there..  That is just really unacceptable.Overall I really liked the game, but they need to get control of the external resources.  I had hoped to go back into the game and start over and see if there was anything I missed along the way..  I'm sure I'll be able to, but they should make it easy for people who don't know what to do.A bit of feedback directly to the game devs.. That ""code"" or script you enter for the endgame scenario is a bit too ""real"".. Have you tested to see what happens if a user runs it on their PC?  I haven't tested it myself, but on some older OS, like Windows XP, it might be damaging..  Also, if you go back to the emails to see if you missed anything, if you read the last one, it resets back to that point with the IM dialogue and you have to click through it to get back to where you were.  To end on a positive, I really like the concept and enjoyed it..  I'd like to see an expanded, more in-depth game on the same lines."
,Not Recommended,530920,26674716,"Posted: 18 November, 2016",all,Muut,"Sounded like an interesting concept, but wasn't really much fun to play, mostly because of the UI implementation (I know I'm in the minority here, and usually I wouldn't bash a low-cost indie game for production values, but I think a bit more thought towards usability wouldn't have gone amiss).- You have to keep monkey-typing into the 'MSN'-like window to advance. You don't know how much monkey-typing is needed to complete the text you're typing, or when you'll next need to monkey-type, so there's a constant cycle of mouse-keyboard-mouse-keyboard, etc. Ok, minor inconvenience, but it grates - there has to have been a better way to do this.- Windows can't be moved around, rearranged, or ordered on the desktop. There are times at which it would be useful to view information in one window so that you can type it into another, but that ability is missing.- At one point it's necessary to download and listen to some audio files. This is a cool aspect - merging in the 'real world' with the game - but the sound quality of the files was so scratchy/distorted/badly-levelled that I couldn't understand a word. Perhaps just me, or perhaps they're supposed to be a 'thematic' challenge in this way, but I didn't have any audio-cleanup software handy, so this is the point at which I gave up.- For some reason the Steam overlay didn't work while in-game, so any time it sent me out onto the real web I had to quit the game entirely then reload it.Judging by the generally-good reviews, there's probably something worthwhile here if you're willing to stick with it, but I guess I had a patience-failure with this one."

,Not Recommended,530920,25977315,"Posted: 10 October, 2016",all,Rebuild of Yang,"It's a decent for the two and a half dollars I paid, but it felt rather lacking overall.For one thing, the game's premise is awesome. I love the idea of browsing a haunted, or virus-ridden OS with bugs you have to work around. However, that premise is shattered the minute you boot up the game and get the message from the ""User"". Then it quickly becomes one of those games where the plot is driven by the fake chatroom and not the act of browing and exploring a fake OS. You kind of depend on the person in the chat room to give you the ""next step"" to access more files, or trigger the next part of the narrative.This game also does that ""fake typing"" thing (Where you can press random keys but pre-canned responses come out regardless of what you actually typed), so you can literally roll your head across the keyboard to advance the plot. I personally hate this trend in general because there's always a disconnect between what I feel at the moment and what I'm typing out. It constantly reminds me that I'm just playing a game and not actually browsing an emulated OS. To top it all off, your responses for the first few minutes are  whining about not playing a game you downloaded from Steam, and that really brought me out of the whole thing.My other issue is with the ""OS emulation"" aspect in of itself. Sometimes it's fine, and allows you to copy, paste, and type whatever you like. But one huge issue is the inability to move windows around by clicking and dragging. This gets especially annoying later because there are clues on certain windows that you need to advance the plot on other windows, but you have to close one window to access the other window behind it to type in the information you just learned. So, play this game with a phone or some pen and paper handy.One other thing I hate, which is another annoying trend in games, is the puzzles that exist outside of the game, which you can only access by downloading certain files from dropbox and mediafire. Not only are these rather artificial, if just one of them ends up corrupted or pulled down, or if the site hosting them goes under (remember Megaupload, anybody?) it runs the risk of breaking the entire game and making it impossible to progress. There's also a QR code, which is a whole other can of worms, but thankfully, it's just one.Last bit, and this is going into spoiler territory, so don't highlight it if you are still interested in playing.The virus itself only shows up in the last few minutes of the game, which was extremely disappointing. I expected it to start interfering with you in subtle ways throughout the game, but the corruption only starts happening during the climax of the plot and when you attempt to install another virus to fight it. That said, the imagery for the final ""battle"" was AWESOME, and I would have loved for that to be spread across the game.In conclusion, that is how I feel about the game. I still recommend people check it out because I would actually like an Archimedes 2 that maybe doubles down on the OS emulation aspect, and I imagine that would require a higher budget and more development time. This game was a neat little experiment overall, but it just didn't click with me."

Archimedes kept me interested while I interacted across different types of technology.  And the non-canned response was absolutely brilliant!  The ending was a bit abrupt.

,Recommended,530920,25959211,"Posted: 9 October, 2016",all,gtrspctr,"Archimedes has a lot of very interesting ideas. I was looking for something that had to do with cryptography or puzzle-solving; this game satisfied that itch.Without giving too much away, the game opens as though it is a virtual desktop running an OS called Intra. Much of the dialogue and story is moved forward by talking to a character through instant messaging. It isn't as tedious as it might sound, though, because the character has you perform several tasks on the OS.What I like about Archimedes is that not only does it make references to real-world locations, but it has you use real-world tools outside of the game (like Google Maps and audio players) to move the game along. There was a time when it had me download some files from a Dropbox folder. I was a little wary of it (you know, don't want to catch a virus), but I scanned them and they're safe.I would like to see another game like this come out. I only wish that it was a little deeper - I wish there were more details in Intra that I could dig around for, maybe find out more about the in-game characters/company/other plot devices. I wish there were more real-world references, like locations to look up, etc. That sort of stuff reminds me of Dan Brown's novels (like the Da Vinci Code), and that's the kind of thing that would really suck me in!"
,Recommended,530920,25919069,"Posted: 7 October, 2016",all,Lowbacca1977,"For the amount of game, I'd say wait to buy this on a sale. My full game time was an hour, and so at that time, I'd say $1.50-$2 would be a fair price to pay. I think the big thing the game is lacking is that prompts trigger under very narrow conditions, and it would benefit if, for example, you could ask simple questions to get slight hints of what it's expecting you to do. Nothing too much, but because so much of this game happens outside this game, that alone would help to make sure that things are working right outside the game parameters. This also goes for how it's meant to feel like a moderately expansive OS, but there's large limitations on what it can or can't do, and the lack of feedback means it's not too intuitive. Ironically, dealing a lot with command lines to begin with actually makes it seem even less intuitive.That aside, I think the game does have a really interesting sort of concept and sort of lore to it. It's an interesting, and at points chilling, way to spend an hour, even if it is rough around the edges in several spots."

While I was aware of this kind of concept (the gameThe Flockcomes to mind), there is absolutely NO information about this on the storepage of this game, making this kind of modification to the software borderline illegal, as it is literally dead software in your library. I don't think I would have made this purchase knowing this beforehand.Archmides is an ARG (alternate reality game) featuring an basic OS-desktop as your playground. Soon after starting the game you are contacted by some unknown outside person, seeking your aid in solving the mysteries hidden in the files of the OS. Playing the game requires pen&paper, lots of Alt+Tabing and visiting several webpages like Google Maps or Dropbox.Graphics and sound are minmial, the design tries hard to resemble a Win 3.0-look, but still feels lackluster, without any charme. Any kind of eye-catching feature or possible more interaction with the OS would have been a large improvement.While the story seems compelling enough, soon you realize that you are being guided through the game, not really discovering the dark secrets of a fictional agency but rather getting told ""enter this URL, go there, listen to that, read that page for secrets"". Coupled with the slow conversation pace of the informant (all your responses are scripted) I soon felt frustrated, as it was impossible for me to experiment what I would be able to discover on my own. Seeing as this kills any kind of immersion and the game is very short in playtime, the only recommendable feature is its low price."

If you don't like writing stuff down and doing a lot of researching outside of the game this game ain't for you. You won't need any programming or vastly advanced computer skills to play this game (the few times you do need those the solution is written down somewhere in the game)You will have to a lot of things outside of the game like downloading files and sometimes even edit them to get information and move on. That means you will spend a lot of your time with this game outside the actual game instead of playing around with the ingame OS. Thats also part of it's weaknesses. You do A LOT of stuff outside the game but I would have liked a bit more playing around in the OS itself.The second thing is the OS: It is very basic. Windows are static and cant be moved and there can only be one or two windows up at a time. There is also not much to do inside of the OS because there aren't a lot of functions in it and the few functions that are available are only useful at certain times in the story. The OS isn't the meat of the game. Itrather functions as a story-device to give you stuff to do outside of the game.The third thing is the playtime: It took me 110 minutes to complete this game (leaving the game running while doing all the outside game stuff in the browser) thats 110 minutes with getting stuck twice taking around ten to fifteen minutes each to get back on track. 110 minutes is not bad for a 3 dollar game but it feels like once you get the hang of it and get into the story it ends a bit abruptly and leaves you hanging wanting more.The third thing is a bit nitpicky: the background noise doesn't make a lot of sense and physically hurt me.The game has background noise consisting of computer-fan and harddrive noises- given that the game tells you that it is the VM of an operating system, the noise doesn't make much sense even though it is probably there so you get more immersed. There is also a highpitched hissing (probably a coil whine) and even though I had the game running with a pretty low volume it gave me really bad tinnitus and even slight hearing loss on one ear (nothing permanent, it got better after an hour or so) with headphones on.I also encountered a few bugs in my playthrough: I could access the ingame email account without a password prompt before it. So the long quest for getting the login info just got me back to where i was. Putting in the info still got the game to progress. And later you have to copy and paste 5 or 6 commands into a command line. I just put in the first one and still beat the game which shouldn't have worked.All in all if you like the idea of a game making you think outside of the box and don't mind getting stuck once or twice,for 3 dollars you are getting a pretty good and slightly creepy game that is a bit rough around the edges."

Two of the mediafire links the game spat at me dont work, and the QR code it gave me led to another dead end.This game is a really bad example of ARG. In a well made ARG you're given a lot more material to work with and you slowly wring information out of what you have and get closer and closer to some breakthrough. I can say that after 30 minutes of this its just boring. I can understand how some people who have nothing better to do could really get into this, but I for one am glad I got it for $1, and even then Im considering refunding it."

If you want to write a novel or make a movie, just do that. Don't make me sit here randomly tapping to get through your 90 minute cutscene.Yes, there WAS one puzzle, and I understand from reading other reviews that there's a section later about hunting down files on your computer but I haven't gotten there so far.My suggestion would be to invest some time in or buy dlls for some chatbot AI and then actually let the user type in the box and interact with your bot.

76561198009047103,Recommended,530920,26005058,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,DowranKing,"As with many horror games, the true fear is in the anticipation of what is to come. Archimedes manages to capture that anticipatory horror and suspense very well. The puzzles and fourth-wall breaking tasks are novel and enjoyable though I never felt as though I came up against a wall at any point. (Which is a positive and a negative!)For it's price it is a very enjoyable game, I feel like I got my money out of it and it only took around 75 minutes to finish. Which doesn't sound very long but given the price point I think that I got good value out of it.The puzzles themselves are enjoyable but not so obtuse, the suspense is great though if I were unaware that the game is considered a horror game I'm not convinced that I would be as nervous as I was throughout. I wouldn't want to spoil the game but I did find that the 'reveal' was a little underwhelming and I think I would have liked to see more of the game actively trying to scare, perhaps another 20 or so minutes added on to the game would have been nice just to see more of the antagonist actively interfering with my actions or causing issues whilst solving puzzles.That said, I consider this game to be a rough gem, worth the money and definitely something I would love to see more of. It whetted my appetite for more games which are ARG-like and I felt at the end like I wanted more. Certainly a better outcome than becoming jaded by what is going on and feeling like I was slogging through to the end to see the conclusion.I thoroughly enjoyed the game but I'm left wanting more of this type of ARG-esque experience, the suspense was great but the reveal didn't spook me as much as I had built up, but maybe that's a testament to the atmosphere the game creates. All in all, if you like puzzles and mysteries, especially those that break the fourth wall and leak out into the real cyberspace I would wholeheartedly recommend the game. For the price point an hour's entertainment is well worth it and it has certainly left a hunger that I never knew I had. Cheaper than going to see a movie and certainly felt alot more engaging and involving.As with games of this type there is pretty much no replayability, once you've solved the puzzles it's done. Great game, great atmosphere. If you're on the fence, and you think it might be your thing, give it a shot."

,Recommended,530920,32933345,Posted: 28 June,all,BOY SAMPSON,"Archimedes, which was recently (and very deservedly) awarded Best Alternate Reality Game at the 2017 Gaming & Entertainment Awards, is a gripping and unsettling psychological horror game that can easily be completed in an hour or so (but will likely stick with you for substantially longer).The game mainly takes place in an emulated 90s-style OS -- indeed, this was one of the main draws of the game for me. This game was recommended in the comments section of a review for Kyle Seeley's excellent Emily Is Away Too, and, although the games could not be more different thematically, there are a number of similarities between Archimedes and the Emily Is Away games, including the game's reliance on what appears to be an older instance of technology and the centrality of an instant messenger program to the storyline. However, Archimedes takes a notable departure from the Emily games in tone, and, ultimately, in gameplay, as completing the game will require exploring corners of the web outside of the actual game (exponentially increasing the effectivenvess of the alternate reality that creator Joshua Hughes is striving to create).Archimedes is not flawless (e.g., some formatting oddities within the documents found on the mock OS jolted me out of an otherwise fairly convincing imaginative experience; it is, perhaps a little short, even given the fully appropriate pricetag), but, for those who enjoy alternate-reality games, seek out independent psychological horror, or consider themselves nostalgia junkies, Archimedes is a couple of dollars very well-spent.Strongly Recommended (8.5/10)"
