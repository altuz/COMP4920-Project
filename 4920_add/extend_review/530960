However, it is a single mission and in my 17 minutes of play I managed to complete 3 separate playthroughs. This is more of a tech demo than a stand alone game. In under 20 minutes I've done it all, simply not enough content to warrant the price tag ($1 a minute in my case). I have refunded for now but once this title has more content it will certainly warrant a purchase."

Really nice graphics, excellent gameplay and exact controls. The devs even want so far to model the arms on your character, not just floating hands or guns, the arms even move very natural with your hands. Small details like this get's you even deeper into the VR immersion! This game might become boring in the long run but in it's current state it's a really kick♥♥♥♥♥arcade style VR shooter.Edit: After spending a little more time with the game I really wish they at least included one more weapon, maybe a submachine-gun or a shotgun. I'm pretty sure they will include this in future updates and hopefully an extra map to play."

When I mean short you can complete the 2 levels combined in less than 15 minutes. Yes that's the entire game, 15 minutes. The levels are the first sections of the first chapter, the game is following some kind of story. That's not described but you can tell there's meant to be a plot.The amount of content in this game, regardless of the polished quality is no more than a demo. This game is incomplete and should not be purchased until the developer makes this into a complete game. Go ahead, pay £14.99 for a demo, it's your money. I feel cheated and so will you when you reflect on how little there is. You can argue there's replay value in those 2 short levels, sure, but that will wear thin quickly.My advice, add to your wishlist and keep an eye out for new content. If it's on sale then it's your shout whether to take a gamble. Just remember this game was released over 6 months ago. Does that give you confidence, 6 months development time post-launch for a 15 minute game?"

The arm movement that reflects your actual arm is revolutionary for VR, and it looks so damn freaking real, like a real arm, not a video game interpatation.. The enemies reaction to being shot is lamo thou. They get shot by your lazers and do not have any reaction, that killed my interest right away. The explosions are phnominal and so are the reactions to it. Please fix the damn hit reaction to the lazer bullets. That is a game changer and decider.

The super slow-mo explosion looks beautiful and blasts enemies all over the room.The music is excellent, some dirty electronic dubstep nonsense but really gets you pumped while everythings kicking off.Its only good in short bursts though. This isnt Skyrim, its a quickfire, loud & fast (and slow) shooter, maybe 2/3 goes tops before the repitition sets in, but it sticks with you.. 30 mins later i'll want to play it again to try and beat my score. Its also a great party game, i've had a few people come round to play and trying to beat eachothers score was great fun.I look forward to future content, at the moment its a bit limited, one gun, one level, one enemy...

I have an rx480 and don't have to turn everything down to low, I even turned up supersampling! The gameplay is fast, and unless I'm doing something wrong, involves a lot of crouching, so as well as being a big workout, is a workout on your knees which may not be ideal for some people.

You guys just released this game a few months ago, and then dropped the overrun dlc that pretty much more than doubled the size of content. Which is awesome, but it really makes me curious to what the rest of this universe is like?Are we going to see where these aliens come from?What is ROM corp?Are there other characters like me that are getting attacked?Who was those guys talking in the beginning? Sounded like there was a group of people getting attacked somewhere on the ""ship"". do we ever see them?Why are they attacking me? I mean, I get that we are throwing their eggs (which is pretty F'ed up of us to do so) but why ME specifically? Am I in some sort of ship that gets those eggs? Am I in headquarters?

76561198014352786,Recommended,530960,30320862,Posted: 4 March,all,DayBowJow,"ROM: Extraction is a really fun game once you get the hang of it! DO NOT PLAY IT ONCE AND GIVE UP!!!I see a lot of other reviews here talking about the ""amount of content"". I think those people are not understanding what kind of game this is. It's an ARCADE style shooter. The point is to replay it over and over to try to get a better score AND to have fun with it, doing trick shots and overall just enjoying the game mechanic for what it is.Anyone here that said they ""beat"" the whole game in 12 minutes are idiots. No you didn't, you just played each level at each difficulty once and thought that's it. The first few times I played it was hard, I was throwing orbs and slowing to shoot, but it seemed like i was surfing the line between total chaos and being in control.THAT'S WHEN IT CLICKED!! The key to this game is using the SLOW MO, use it A LOT!!! I can NOT stress how much more fun this game becomes when you start using the slow mo feature as much as you can. DID YOU KNOW that you can heal while in slow mo? It quickly becomes obvious that the trick to survival is milking that slow mo whenever you are starting to die. The fun for me also came in the realization that I DO have the time to plan each throw and aim with precision. To shoot each orb right in front of a robots face and watch that awesome rag doll take over. Once you get the hang of this game, it's easy to go in feeling like a badass! Neo style taking out robots one after another. Hitting that slow mo, then turning around just in time to see a robot flying through the air straight at me and shooting him in the head, decapitating him, right before he lands.... absolutely, BADASS!!!Plus it's only $5 right now, I have eaten $5 of Taco Bell in about 10 minutes and never thought twice about it again. How are you people complaining about the worth of this game when it's only $5? I cant replay my taco bell....TLDR: This game is meant to be replayed, its an ARCADE game. Not Skyrim. Give it some time to master the mechanics, there is a learning curve. And finally, use that SLOW MO!!! If you use it to its full potential, you can be like Neo in the Matrix."

76561198064106555,Recommended,530960,30388885,Posted: 8 March,all,mrorange,"Fun little wave shooter with a very interesting idea. There is no room scale, it's a standing experience. Game is very fast. You need to turn around a lot.In the right hand you have your weapon and in the left hand you have an orb ball. The gameplay works that you throw the orb ball on enemies, then you slow down the time and shoot the orb ball which explodes and kills the enemies around you.This goes surprisingly fast and makes fun so far. Further, you can pick up different orbs like explosion.At the moment there are only two levels. Not a lot, but it seems the developers working on more.It is a good game to show off your Vive. It has nice effects, a lot of particles, great colour scheme and an easy game mechanic.Don't expect  a Raw Data or a fully fledged game.But even if you are sceptical to buy a nother wave shooter, I recommend to take a look on this for the sale price of 5 EUR."

I'll revise it if and when they expand the game to an acceptable level, but currently its just a highly polished overpriced tech demo (or early access). If you want to spend your money, there are other VR titles around that deserves the money. Go buy Raw Data instead.ROM: Extraction is, as of this writing (26 Mar), is lacking content, but more content will be coming soon according to the developer. It is a turrent-shooter title, whereby you stood in a fixed position and shoot at the robot enemies.At the moment, only the first chapter is available, which is split into 2 segments. In both segments, you fight against enemies in some sort of a facility. These enemies keep coming from various direction, and after you are done killing, you moved to the next rea automatically, done by an automatic sequent where the platform you stood on, goes down deeper. Each of the segment takes about 7-10 minutes to clear.One point that set this title apart is the orb gameplay element and the slow-down bullet-time element. The various types of orbs can inflict various effects, such as healing yourself, or lock an enemy in place and others. One common strategy is to toss an orb near the enemy, slow the orb and then fire at it to create an explosion that inflicts damage. This is a rather cool and fun mechanics in VR.The quality of the title is very good and polished. There's no bugs whatsoever, and it is fun. Its one of the greatest shooter VR at the moment, but as it lacks content (which will be added), you should look elsewhere if you are looking for a meaty VR title now. Otherwise, consider this an early investment for a great VR game to come."

This includes doing the tutorial, messing with graphics settings, completing the game, going back to try the game again with even lower graphics settings.  Total gameplay without the loading screens including tutorial is something like 12.In those 12 minutes you get yet another wave-shooter, a quite pretty one that plays badly, the throwing of balls feels completely unnatural compared to throwing things in other games (like the lab or budget cuts) and the performance on my gtx 1070 was horrible, framerates as low as 40 fps was logged, usually bouncing between 60-80fps making for a nausious experience. This with graphics settings on normal and the supersampling feature (1.27x default) dialed back to 1.0.Apparently this game features some new AMD technology (i saw it featured on the amd press release for vega) so maybe it plays better on an AMD gpu, an nvidia gtx 1070 is defently not enough to run this game thou so be ware nvidia users.All in all this game adds absolutely nothing to the VR scene, its a simple wave shooter much like last years early games but with severe performance issues and not very immersive, doesnt feel like you are there due to unnatural controls.It is simply one of those game devs that go ""if we make pretty screenshots we dont need any content or gameplay""If you are looking for an extremely short wave shooter (think every vive owner is sick of them by now thou)  for the vive there are plenty of other options"

76561198129903896,Not Recommended,530960,30248679,Posted: 28 February,all,corporatezombie,"Ok, I've played 45 minutes of this game. And while it looks great, and has some nice music, it's not really grabbing me in the same way that some other wave VR shooters have (Space pirate trainer). The principle is to throw orbs with one hand, then shoot them with a gun in the other, to make them explode like grenades. You also have bullet time, which slows everything down, making it easier to shoot your orbs.There are power-ups you can shoot which then change your orbs behaviour.There are two levels here, but the game play is well nigh identical for both of them. Throw orbs at robots, slow time, and shoot the orbs, boom.Here is my first problem with the game.It requires you to throw orbs in VR, and they really don't often fly where you expect them to go. So you can throw a lot of orbs trying to get them to go into upper storey alcoves, where they really really don't want to go.Not only that, you really have to throw them with your off hand, since you'll be shooting them with your main hand.So what the game is asking you to do is, throw accurately with your off hand, then shoot the orbs. Which is tricky, and can be frustrating. Plus using the Touch controller, it doesn't really feel like throwing a ball, possibly because you aren't, and also, because you can't really judge the weight like you could with a real ball. With the vive wands, I imagine it's not a lot better.Which brings me on to the second problem with the game.You try and play this as a skill game, throwing and shooting orbs, and you will get a score of around 200,000. You can try harder, throwing, slowing time down, and shooting orbs. Several times. You'll consistently score around 200,000 before the time runs out and the level ends. OK.But, you can also play, just spamming orbs in all directions, not bothering to slow or shoot them. Just randomly throwing them everywhere... without skill. You will score around 300,000. Which is a lot more, right? So where is the reward in playing skillfully? So the whole point of the game, and it's a score attack game, goes out the window. You'd be better off, if you could do away with the gun, and just throw orbs with both hands. In fact, if this was a water bomb filled with paint game, it might be a better, more fun game. It might even make more sence, since robots and paint wouldn't mix well. (Albeit ruining the future cyber punk aesthetic, for something more colourfully Nintendo-esqe! But then think how cool that neon paint effect in Tron Legacy was? It could work!)Then there is the power-ups. You can't use them when you want, they are always the next orb you throw, so you might pick up a useful power-up, but have noone useful to throw it at. They also have some nice effects, like creating a trip wire, but the game is so frenetic, and with them being the next orb, you won't easily be able to make tactical use of them, and you'll probably just throw the orb at a nearby robot anyway, in the hope that it goes somewhere near them and does some damage.Then there's the nominal, running out of health thing, because you are being shot at. Which is pointless, because, there's no point ducking for cover when there are so many robots in different directions, you are against the clock, and you have to see to throw orbs, and then shoot the orbs. Plus you never seem to be able to die on normal mode anyway, even when your health is apparently ""critically low"".Then there is the bouncing of the orbs. When they bounce, they just accelerate away, in a ridiculous anti-physics way. So off the wall, bounce trick shots are impossible, because the orbs, post-bounce move too quickly to shoot, even in bullet time.So, is it a great game? Not really, not yet anyway. Will I be playing it as adictively as that other wave shooter? Nope.But, as a bit of high energy work out, and a bit of a change from space pirate trainer, it might be worth £3.74 of your money while it's on sale."

,Recommended,530960,30601549,Posted: 18 March,all,The5JewBankers,Extremely polished wave shooter with a twist. Your bread and butter are a series of orbs that are extremely powerful if used right. Each are unique in their own way. You spawn the orb in your off-hand to throw and shoot it where you want it to perform it's dance of death. The ball moves extremely fast but a bullet time feature makes it easier to shoot. The targeting and tracking are superb.

Would I pay $20 for the game in its' current state. No. Two levels does not warrant full price. Would I pay $10? Well.... maybe? If the devs continue with this game then it could be the gold standard of all VR wave shooters. More levels, some varied enemies, and there would be no reason to ever own another wave shooter. The mechanics and concept really are that exceptional. Keep up the work devs!"

There's a lot to take in initially with power-ups/orbs but the concept is simple enough: enemies come from all angles and you shoot them before they kill you.Shooters seems to be the bread and butter of VR but where many fail this game seems to keep itself on the right track, graphics are great and sound is on point. If you're looking for a decent shooter at a lower price than the top end you wouldn't be at a loss buying this."
,Not Recommended,530960,33362377,Posted: 7 July,all,Voiderest,"This game is basically a tech demo. I originally only played it for 11 mins and forgot about it. I have 2 hours or so because I wanted the VR collectable.You're on a platform and robots are attacking. There are only 2 levels right now and one of those looks like it was only added to have a new level to show off at a con. You have a gun but it isn't really effective and is really only used to trigger the glowing balls to explode early. If you can hit the robots with a ball it'll kill them to. Very much a wave shooter with no movement system. The graphics, levels, and models all look great but the gameplay isn't interesting enough and there is a serious lack of content. There are power ups but they aren't that interesting or useful."

,Recommended,530960,30497043,Posted: 13 March,all,MrDayman,Probably one of my favorite VR Games even though there is only a few levels and the new one that just came out was free!! very smooth and has a nice feel. Good replay abibility because there is many different power ups and ways to kill the enemies. 7/10 in my book and especially for 5$ is really nice.

Awesome soundtrack and superpowers that make you feel like a badass... However, in it's current state I dont feel it's worth the $20, so wait for a sale or some more added content!"
