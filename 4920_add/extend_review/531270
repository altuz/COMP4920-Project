That combined with the high price makes me unsure of what rating I will give this. Hmmm. Well, it's a much better game then Battle Dome, and it looks good, and feels good, and has cool sounds!I loved the girl team vs the boy team thing. It's cheeky but fun and I hope it stay(ed/s).The death+lobby system is interesting too. When you die or are waiting for a game there is an area you can hang out in with the other ghosts and watch the rest of the match on a screen and play basketball. Hell, that's really good! The environments are nice, but I don't think the 'virus/flag' gameplay goal is worth it. Just make it team-deathmatch, CS:Goo with no bomb. I mean everything in here is great, but it might be hard to get a game going. Oh wait! There's bots! Hmmm. Everything in this game is good, but not many humans play it, and it's too expensive. Good thing I got it on sale, and you should wait for one too. $13 for decent matches with bots and fun guns certainly beats another standing wave shooter. $25, is wack.The name is very strange and I keep getting it confused with another VR game about boxing that I don't even own.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=893260354"

The gameplay is very similar to Onward  – a 4 x 4 ‘milsim’ where you need to communicate clearly with your team mates to plant a virus. There is a lobby when you die and a screen to watch your team mates still playing. The game moves a bit quicker than Onward and has a more stylised design – think Launch Squad.It is still early doors and for £13.99 you only get one map – the devs said they will release another one soon – if you like your vive FPS then it’s definitely worth adding to the collection...as long as there is a critical mass of players playing.  Maybe the devs could drop the price for a bit to get people on board or release a demo?"
,Recommended,531270,29987369,Posted: 17 February,all,NoobsDeSroobs,"Pros:- Very unique movement mechanic that feels a bit off in the beginning, but as you learn to use it it becomes very intuitive and loads of fun. I had a few issues with some movement from time to time, but it was mostly stable.- Similar weapon mechanics as Counter Strike. Set spray patterns that you can learn to increase your aim.- All guns that are not handguns are more stable when dual wielded. This causes many snap decisions between increasing your accuracy and grabbing a grenade to throw at an enemy while you run for cover. This makes the game reward quick thinking and skill level.- The peak mechanic allows for some very fun standoffs and you can provide suppressive fire while your team flanks quite easily.- A nice sharing mechanic where a team member with a lot of money can share money or weapons between players. Weapons, blades, grenades and ammo can also be tossed between players.- When everything goes well you feel like a badass.- High skill ceiling in the competitive game mode, accessibility in the death match game mode.- You will get an workout as your body will move a lot while playing.- Really fun with friends!- Ignoring the skill requirement, the design of the games allows for some fun games even if you only have a few hours to spend.- Really stable netcode. I had no issues at all when playing. Creating a server and joining a server all worked wonderfully.Cons:- Takes a little while getting used to the movement mechanics.- Maps are unfriendly for beginners as you will be flanked and enemies can come from anywhere. You must learn the maps to not get wiped by experienced players. Can lead to frustration in competitive.- Seems slightly unoptimized. I have a 1080 founders edition and I saw some frames drop.- The gravity is way too low so aiming a throw is unnecessarily hard.- A lot is yet to be done. No player information is provided, no friends list and little content. It is a shooter with a few maps so you are expected to master what is there, but might turn samey for those who are not PvP fans.- The angle on the guns on the HTC Vive felt slightly off. The controller and the handle was misaligned by 10-15 degrees.Take it or leave it:- Graphics are mediocre for a VR game. It does what it must, but it will not wow you either. Good aesthetics for the most part that does not hinder gameplay.Conclusion:If you like any Counter Strike game I can easily recommend it for the asking price. If you are not that great with shooters and you don’t want to master the few maps there are you will not enjoy this game as much.The little content might be too repetitive for some, but the content that exist works quite well and is heaps of fun if you learn to master the game.In short, do you like CS style shooters you will enjoy this game."

You buy your gear at the start of each round, the attackers have to take the virus(bomb) to the breach(?)(site) and ""plant"" it by keeping it within the area. The defenders have to prevent the attackers from holding the virus for 45 seconds.So far I think it's fun as♥♥♥♥♥♥ and extremely addictive. It's fast paced, it works well, and the movement is really cool. It's like skiing. Although I think it's possible to go a little too fast, that or the map is too small for the current movement speed. It only has 1 map right now, but it's pretty awesome and has a bit of depth to it. The current map is more death matchy, because it's pretty hard to get the virus to a place without encountering enemies on the way.8/10, is it worth 18 bucks? Yes. is it worth 30? No. But only because of lack of content. Plenty of guns, but there needs to be more maps and also private matches before its worth 30 dollars."

The only problem I run into is the really small player base :/ the 30 dollar price tag can be hard to swallow but seriously this game is worth it.The game itself is very like counter strike. 2 teams of 4 face off. 1 team defends while the other attempts to place a virus ball into a breach zone. The guns all behave uniquely but in a way that you can learn and get used to pretty quickly.Big tip. Play a solo game with bots on decoy difficulty to run around and learn the ins and outs of the map before joining with people. The learning curve can be pretty steep otherwise.

I'm not very sensitive to motion sickness, but after a minute or two of disorientation it started to feel very natural.  It's a bit like cross country skiing, where you use the controllers to push yourself in a direction, and more immersive than teleporting.The graphics are very basic and SUPERHOT-like except for the weapons.  Weapons-handling (pickup, drop, and reload) are very awkward and frustrating when you're being shot at.This title should deliver much more for the asking price, so I would hold off until it's more developed."

Add other players of the game as friends, hop into a game, and just wait a minute or two if no one is on.

It has the good combination of them all.The gameplay is polished, and allows you to dual-wield, aim better by using two hands, give or throws ammo and weapons to team members, hop over walls, steal weapons and ammos from dead ennemies, etc, in a kind of Matrix environnement.You buy weapons at the start of each round with the money earned during previous round.There are objectives, but you can win by exterminating the opposite team. Teamwork is better, but not mandatory (you can play like a selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and still be useful for your team).The +-The game is fast paced and immersive, intuitive, responsive, and offers quite a lot of possibilities- Almost all kind of weapons are already usable (guns, SMG, grenades, rifles, shields, blades, ...)-You have the choice in locomotion systems, and the ""arm swinging"" is a bit weird at start, but works well once mastered after a few minutes, and even allows you to climb through a window, onto the roofs, etc, in an intuitive way.- the environnement and level design are really nice, and it's a pleasure to get cover behind a corner on a balcony while bullets are raining around you, or to shoot an enemy down from 3rd floor while strafing with two guns.- Graphics are clear and visibility is great, the weapon models are very detailed.The --there really should have more content to justify the full price. More maps, more avatars, more modes. There is no way to customize an avatar for the moment, so everybody from the same team looks the same. It looks like a roadmap will be released soon, and it looks like the devs are really listening to the community (I even had a 30 minutes game with one of them, and it was fun to watch him learn in-game to another player how realoading works).-I encounter framerate issues with a gtx 970 (i5 6600, 16go), I really hope there would be fixed, or that the game would be optimized, or that there was a way to set some graphic options (edit: well it seems that there is a way to setup options in Unity launcher, I have to try that).-some little glitches are remaining (guns sometimes being a bit off the hands, some weapons hard to reaload, characters in strange postures, etc)... well nothing of these 3 points that an early access can't fix... ;)Looking forward to the roadmap ! I wish that dev would add more than new content, but also some more new gameplay ideas, and this could really become a must-have.Anyway by its state now, I recommend it anyway while it's on sale. The good thing is that the game is already very fun and polished, but there is still plenty of room for improvement to make it an even better game."

Think of it as CS GO with the payment system. Then you get to pick your weapons and equipment and go fight again. Rounds usually last from 2-5 mins long and gets going right away since the maps are smaller.There are 2 ways to move in the game; Pro: which has you move your arms like your are skiing (pretty challenging) and Normal: which uses the menu button while held down to move in a direction you want to go (Think Hover Junkers movement here). All in all this is a fun game. Price at this level should be around $9.99 but when it has the colors, sounds, and atmoshphere better polised it will be a $20.00 game. Good job so far devs!"

The Counter-Strike gameplay is fun as is free for all deathmatch. The locomotion methods used for navigation work really well. Both easy and pro mode. Neither make me dizzy.The AI in the game is not too smart but has like 100% kill accuracy. Hopefully it will be improved in the future.Game visually looks great, and plays very smoothly. Only time I encountered lag was in death match when there were likely over 100 bodies all over the arena. Something easily fixed by the developer. Hopefully more weapons and levels come in the future but this is a very promising game. My only fear is the price will keep the player base too small. Hopefully it goes down to around $20 so more people get it. That or better bot AI needs to exist to make the bots something you can fight against."
,Recommended,531270,28901674,Posted: 1 January,all,8Z,"This is the closest thing to VR CSGO you can get.Graphics - 6.5/10Meh at best, the game is clunky around the edges. Models look like they come from different games, and the map looks excatly like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Unity map. However, it's acceptable.Controls - 8/10The game offers Easy (Locomotion) and Pro (Drag to move) movement types. Pro is harder to use but provides tatical advantage (can climb over obstacles).Gameplay - 8.5/10It's what you expect - CSGO VR. The core gamemode is very similar to CS - 4v4, 2 bomb sites, and a bomb (in this game, a ball shaped virus) to plant. Aside from killing everyone else, Red wins by holding the virus inside the zones for 40 seconds, and Blue wins by running down the clock, or disarming the virus by holding it for 40 seconds. It is a small but nice twist to the CS styled gameplay.The weapons provided are varied enough to provide choice. 1 sniper rifle (AWP), 2 rifles, 3 smg, 2 pistol, and 4 grenades. There should probably be more in the future. Melee weapons (Knife or the katana) are instant kills, and there is a shield.The unique features of VR also ties neatly into the gameplay. You can peek and duck with your body, and it can become very intense.Community - 7(?)/10I cannot completely speak for this since I do not participate in development. Not many players are online, but you usually can find 1~3 people to play with.Overall - 8/10A pretty good VR game, and I recommend it if you are looking for VR gunfight akin to that of Counter Strike."

,Recommended,531270,29177035,Posted: 10 January,all,anger,"You should read this butTL;DR: Buy this game. It's really fun to play.Me and one enemy are the last ones alive. A dead teammate guides me to the bomb so I can go and plant it at a nearby site. Plant goes out and the enemy is walking about trying to find where the bomb is and where I am. I see him going up, but he does not see me at first; I am laying on my back, flat as can be. This split second advantage, combined with the fact that I am as close to the ground as can be, allowed me to kill the enemy, winning my team the round.Or I could overshoot throwing to the bombsite, twice, which causes my team to lose a different round.The Art of Fight isfun.There's so much variety in this game, and it keeps getting better with each update. The newest one just added a new map, and you can climb practically everything, where the only limits are your play space. But let's run down the list of what you can doGameplayYou may hear people calling this the ""counter-strike"" of VR.They're damn right.In a 4v4 setting, the attack team plants a virus at one of two sites, while the defending team tries to prevent that from happening. The difference between this and CS is simple to see when you get in game though: anyone can be anywhere and you can be attacked from anywhere.And I cannot stress that enough, because verticality in this game is insane. Here's something to live by, especially in the new map:If there's somewhere to stand, someone can (and will) be there.But let's step back for a moment and talk about some more game stuff.GunsThere are a lot of guns. 3 pistols (each side has 1 unique pistol), 3 SMGs (universal), 3 rifles (each side has 1 unique rifle, and then a sniper rifle), buncha grenades, and then you have a knife and katana, if you want to goin. You could also cheese a riot shield but it's pretty hard. You can also buy armor, and you buy as many gun mags as you see fit. You can place items on your body, up to 8 (max 4 weapons), so keep that in consideration too.One thing to note though is that when buying a gun, you do not have a magazine loaded to start with. Make sure to buy a mag to put in the gun and actually load the gun too.I prefer to dual wield pistols. There's a little trick to using them that makes things so much easier when using them, but once you know it, it's just really fun to use them. Getting melee kills also has that same feeling of reward, because being able to melee kill someone just feelsgreat.Also, if an enemy died near you, pick up their stuff. Even if you don't use it, there's a 'recycling bin' to the left of your buy zone where you can sell items. Gotta get that $money$.MovementIf I had to tell you the most standout feature of this game, it would be the movement system. It's like an exaggerated walk, almost; you hold a button to ""grab the air"", swing backwards (think from roughly 3-7 on a clock), and let go during that swing, and it moves you forward. Obviously I'm downplaying it, and a lot of people have expressed their complaints about the system, but once you get a hang of the movement system it just feels incredible. I wouldn't say that it feels natural, but you feel more in control of your character.But if you don't want to use the movement system, that is okay. On your buy screen there is a ""locomotion mode"" setting, and by turning that to easy, you now use touchpad movement. You can also toggle a makeshift easy mode in pro mode, which allows you to walk at a slow pace, useful for turning corners while ready.MapsNot many. I believe there's 5 of them at the moment, and you can tell which ones are early maps by their color schemes. However, you can see the development process here. As the maps 'evolved', many more places where you could climb were added and in the newest map (Sands) you can get pretty much anywhere by climbing. I still remember on Chapel (not sure if that's the name), I would buy an awp and climb up the side of the Chapel and go into the window, and just sit perched up there, sniping. I'm bad at sniping though, so that went badly.VerdictThis game is really,reallygood. Although the player base is small, it's a fun playerbase and you can generally find someone on at some point in time and just play some games. Here's what I think:The new movement system is pretty neat to use.Gunplay feels great and there generally won't be cases of repetitive fights.The Maps give you options on how to approach a situation, and your weapons can help you in the situation at hand.If you like the longer, more tactical fights offered by Onward, by all means, go ahead and play Onward. But if you want to try a new VR shooter (that can potentially get really competitive, given a decent amount of players), then try this one out. For $18, you won't regret it."

There absolutely is a very dedicated and loyal newbie friendly multiplayer community. It's usually active in the evenings on weekdays and all day on weekends. My reccomendation is start adding people who leave positive reviews of this game to your steam friends list. That way when you play, they'll be notified of it and then they'll join in. It's pretty much a must to do this with any VR multiplayer game due to how niche VR currently is since it's still only wealthy early adopters who have it.My largest complaint with this game is that the bots are completely brain dead."

I see myself being able to play this game for a half hour or so and walk away feeling like I had a lot of interaction and some fun competition. Similar to Rec Room's paintball in that regard, but I prefer the locomotion in this game to teleporting around like Rec Room. However, I do not like swinging my arms in this game to travel. Fortunately, they have an Easy mode where you just hold a button and you're propelled in the direction the controller is pointing, similar to Hover Junkers. I prefer the trackpad movement in Onward, but this method works ok. So far the servers seem to have people playing, so finding people to play against has not been a problem.

The locomotion technique beats the hell out of any teleportation you'll find in most other games and it even gives you the option to use a standard fps movement with the trackpad.The community is great for the most part. So far we are a wide range of players who mostly want to help each other out when we can. New players are never shamed.That's not to say this game is without its issues. It's early access now, so expect to run into bugs; lots of them. The balance of the game feels a bit off and the limited weapon selection is pulled straight from counter strike. Players with low ceilings will be at a disadvantage as climbing high walls gives you an edge.Players who experience motion sickness: I highly recommend trying the demo first. If you're comfortable with the locomotion system, get in here and help keep these lobbies full!"

,Recommended,531270,28226824,"Posted: 6 December, 2016",all,Sirk,"This is currently what I would assume is the most favorable FPS game on the market. It has the best movement controls out of any game out there making it feel very action oriented when it comes to sprinting and climbing. It's a steep learning curve with the movement and steeper with the climbing, though they did implement a tutorial to support that, and also included a basic movement setting for those who just want to jump in.Some of the maps are in black and white so don't let that fool you, this game had a big graphic overhaul with a new 'colored' map, and I'm sure more are to come. This is most definitely my go to game for VR, whenever I jump on to play, this gets put on at least once. Can't wait to see where this game goes.8/10 - big con - can't open steam menu during a match, it will crash the game. some people press on accident. very frustrating."
76561197983029096,Recommended,531270,25992195,"Posted: 11 October, 2016",all,Tortillas,"This is, in my opinion, the first real VR game, this and Vertigo. First off let's start with movement. You have full roomscale with open locamotion, no teleporting around. I don't know if it's because I got use to it, but I no longer get motion sickness from this style of movement. To move you just point a controller, any of the two, in whatever direction you want to move. So pretty  much just treat it like your right thumb on an analog controller and rotate your body to turn. Add in the addition of room scale allowing you to jump out of the way, duck under cover, creep around walls and add in multiplayer shooter and you have yourself a blast.The game plays more or less like Counter Strike, which is awesome in my book. You can play tradition deathmatch by default by just killing the team until they're all dead. Just like CS it's an elimination game, no spawning until the next round so make sure you play smart. There is also a virus reminicent of the bomb in CS which you can use to end the game. Never got the virus to the destination as you tend to run into someone pretty quickly. Games fill up fast and with plenty of talkative players.What really makes this game unique and fun is just how tough fighting with guns really is. It's not clunky, but when you think about how you reload in the middle of a fight and how you actually pull it off is a different story. You can place weapons, ammo, grenades, and all the fun stuff on your character. So when you buy your gun, just like in CS buy phase, you get all your items physically placed in front of you. Grab your ammo clips and slap them on your chest, buy a secondary handgun to keep off to the side and strap a few grenades on your belt. Don't forget to load your gun since it doesn't preload it for you.Here are a few examples that really made this game fun for me.1. I spent 6k on two glocks, eight clips, two grenades, two smoke, a shield, sword, and an AK47 with 6 more clips.. I was strapped as fuuuuuck. I could barely see over my guns and ammo I had so much strapped onto me. I run out into the field and get the drop on an enemy. I go to unload my AK and click, click, click, clik... Shiiiit. I forgot to♥♥♥♥♥♥the gun.. dead.2. I was up on a balcony covering my two teammates running the virus. I saw a guy behind them and leaned over the edge and got a few good shots on him. Leaned back over while he shot at me and blind fired him till he was dead.  Look over to my left down the staircase and I see a guy lining up a shot. I immediately drop to the ground for cover and hear the bullets spray over me with particles falling down from the ricochet. Jump back up and miss two shots and I'm empty. Crouch back down and fumble looking for my spare clip. Slap the clip in,♥♥♥♥♥♥the gun and pretty much jump shoot, duck, shoot, duck, shoot, duck, until I killed him. Another guy runs up mid reload and kills me.3. Got behind someone and forgot to load my spare gun. I try to put my empty gun on my chest  but dropped it as I fumbled for my clip. So I try to grab the gun mid air not knowing I already had the clip and ended up dropping both as the guy killed me.4. I grabbed a shield and a gun and tanked for some teammates. Not an infinite shield I found out as it broke super quick.. like 10-20 shots from an AK. point blank. Next round I grabbed a sword and shield and turned into rambo. I hid around corners and waited for everyone to spread out. Then I jumped out of doorways and stabbed the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them and the couldn't kill me quick enough solo with the shield.This game also seems like it will go to some ESports soon. The amount of extra things you can do with the physics are incredible. I had the virus in one hand and a pistol in the other. Emptied my clip in a fight and couldn't reload with the virus in my hand. So I threw the virus in the air, grabbed the clip on my chest, loaded and primed to shoot and ready to catch the virus from hitting the ground. There was another time when I was trying to practice loading guns in the waiting lobby. You can pop your clip with trackpad up, grab a clip, load and♥♥♥♥♥♥in about two to three seconds. That's after about ten tries so I can only imagine how quick an every day player could be who has a 1080 graphics card. There's also the level of teamwork that goes into this game. Running out solo will most likely lead to a quick death. Coordinating with your team to let them know the pointman needs to reload to cycle out another player up front. Knowing who has flashbangs, smoke, or explosives could turn the tide of any battle. Strategically placing teammates on vantage points with snipers. Trying to siege a building filled with enemies having shootouts in hallways and through doorways.So yeah shooting and game play is fun. The actual real life situations you never had to experience with a controller add a new element of gameplay. It honestly changes the entire pace of the game and having room scale to crouch behind any cover, blind fire any time with your own accuracy, and creep around any corner or doorway without the camera ♥♥♥♥ing up truly makes this one a must have.Game plays smooth as butter on a 960 at good settings."

It is a problem for games because a sense of speed is a glorious thing. to make action feel viceral, you need it. So far we have been trying things that disguard it entirely for the sake of comfort. In onward for example, you go from stationary to moving instantly.Now if your own body's movement is the source of the acceleration, your brain begins to believe it. In RAF, if you need a big acceleration to get to cover in time to save your skin, you will have to make a great big, full body gesture in order to propel yourself there. this game solves the problem perfectly with their control mechanic. Intense, viceral game mechanic.i would just like to say this is my first review of a game ever.shows how big of a deal i think this game is. go devs, go."

While it is still in alpha, what drew me to this was the amount of play time associated with the positive reviews. I have had this game for 2 weeks and it is quickly becoming one of my most played games (14.1 hours at the time of writing).Pros:Counterstike for VR...... if your a CS:Go junkie this is a huge plusPro Movement (Ski poles):This movement style has you swinging your arms. I have found this movement style to be very, very, (did I say very?) comfortable as someone who gets VR sick easily as my brain can anticipate the movement vs holding a control.Highly Replable( Just look at the play time for thumbed up reviews ) It has easily become one of my VR favorites.Friendly community:When people are on they work to help new players. Headset and mic are a huge plus when playing this game.Cons:Better with a larger play space: Especially using pro movement. I find that I run using the pro movement and I fight within my play space such as ducking, corner, and room fighting.Limited Player Base:because this game is newer and still in alpha it is hard to find players. I generally see them the most active on weeknights 7pm - 10pm EST and more commonly on weekends. I will say though starting a game and waiting for people to show up around these times works well as fewer people like to be the one to wait.Easy Move:If you play Onward and like the directional pad movement, this mode of movement is not nearly as polished and does not allow you to climb. Though Onward and the easy movement in this game both make me sick very quickly.Alpha Cons (Should be fixed in time as the game moves to beta and launch):Occasional Load issuesLimited GunsLimited MapsBots:  for lack of a better word, are stupidIn progress graphicsAlways make sure you buy enough ammo .... and I hope to see you in the Sands."

It is enjoyable, but after a while I started to hate it, and now I just force myself every once in a while to play. Here are some reasons why:I barely meet anyone online. Usually I start out alone and 1 or max 2 players join in an hour or so.There are lots of bugs, expect to fall out the map, drop you magazine when you move, or throw something on the floor instead of holstering it. The bots are not functioning properly so single player gets boring real fast. PRO movement lets you climb, wich is cool, but you can't move and aim at the same time with it so you end up playing the EASY movement. But then you will just get stuck on the tinyest steps or anything and you have to wait for someone to kill you. And I could go on."

The best way to describe it would be like a more action packed onward with less downtime, throw in a little counterstrike (buying loadout) and a bit of climbey type locomation, climbing around the level with guns and it just doesnt get any better! also due to christmas and the demo release the game seems to be growing more and more by the day and i definitely dont see the momentum going down anytime soon... this is getting updated by the week, and not pointless crappy updates. very core gameplay tweaks the community wants coupled with the occasional surprise like a new maps or when necessary bug fixes/game balancing. with this last update the devs even threw in a basketball court and ball to mess around with in between the match for people who joined the server ha."

It's tense and tactical, taking cover and pulling weapons off dead enemies is one of the most intense things I've done in a game.This is all coming from what I've seen in early access. I can only imagine the game will get more content, more polish, and more popular.It's also worth noting that this dev team appears to be pretty involved with their users. They've been listening closely and implementing changes based on community feedback.Buy this game, it's the best thing.***EDIT*** Unfortunately the devs decided to bring the game out of Early Access far too early and seem to have mostly given up with development. They're not responding to the discussion boards and every time they update they appear to have broken something new. They've gimped the 'easy' locomotion system to the point of being unusable which is unfortunately pushing away a lot of new players.The Pro locomotion has been improved quite a bit and I find sliding around in other games is just stupid compared to pro mode. Pro-mode vs Easy mode (which is simiallar to what every other VRFPS uses) is like comaping mouse keyboard to gamepad. I have a crazy amount of control onmver my position and can move far more realistically than I can with the standard sliding system. This pro-mode however takes quite a bit of getting used to as it's not very intuitive, with that said though I still have more fun playing alone with bots with this locomotion than I do playing in a full server in Onward or Pavlov.At this point though with the player count very rarely hitting double digits and the devs seemingly absent it's real hard to recommend this to anyone. When we still had players it was the best experience on the Vive hands down, had I tried it in a VRarcade I'd have bought a Vive just to play it. Now I just play with predictible bots and miss what this game once had..."

The best players use a lot of physicality, including crouching, swinging their arms for movement, and moving their body to peek corners. Even when I lose, it's satisfying to know that my opponent had to sweat for it.Rounds are nice and short, so you can risk some really creative and aggressive tactics, and if you die you won't have long to wait. Things to try:- Climb up the side of a building to flank somebody- Throw a flashbang and then come in shooting- Lure somebody to a doorway and wait with a katana- Distract somebody with a riot shield while your friend shoots themThese concepts are not new to video games, but AoF is immersive and physical enough to make everything fresh and memorable.

The climbing mechanics are intriguing, but buried behind the compulsory 'Pro' movement setting, which requires the player to move their arms in oppose to a simple button press, taking focus away from aiming or shooting. The alternative (and somewhat condescendingly titled) 'Easy' movement mechanic uses the menu button + controller pointing to move the player, but removes the climbing mechanic from the player's access.Due to oddly placed controller bindings and strangely restricted access to ammo and weapons, this game is very difficult to come back to after having played games such as Onward or Bullets And More.

Again this is also well done too but I found it easier point and hold to move.They do not have 10 differnt weapons for a class like call of duty might, but they seem to have every class, and In my book that is something more as it keeps everyone on the same playing field.

With the advanced locamotion I find it difficult to move how I want and shoot at the same time. It also makes moving across the map a chore. With the games easy mode movement, I find it to hard to move precisely (point and move movement). What I really want is some combination of the two systems where I can move fast with a trackpad but fine tune my position using manual locamotion.The games inventory system on the other hand is great. It's a mix of CS weapon shop purchasing and placing the items on your body to access them. You can place them anywhere and grab them later. I think its neat and allows for a lot of personal flexability with weapon and clip placement.The map and objective that are currently in are fun enough. It's not terribly complex but it's overall fast paced and fun, something I sometimes find myself missing inbetween Onward Deaths.After that, there's not much else to see here right now. There are lots of bugs. The visuals leave a lot to be desired. It may be worth picking up for the discount price, but you know how it is with these things. A small dev team can only make so many fixes by themself. And most of the promising titles in VR don't make fast progress past their initial release due to this. It tends to leave my library litered with really good PoC games that are fun for a couple of weeks but then get stale or replaced due to something a little more new and different.I got it for the discount price. I like to think I'm funding the future of new and more innovative VR game mechanics. I knew what I signed up for."

It just hits a certain FPS itch that Onward and Battle Dome, while great games, just don't quite hit. Each game is quick, gives you a chance to experiment with different guns and strategies, and allows for a great time! However, that being said, I've already bumped into a lot of bugs. First, I frequently can't spawn anymore ammo or guns for myself even though I have plenty of money to buy them. Second, often the money counter doesn't seem accurate, I'll buy a number of things but it remains on the same amount. The third one I didn't experience personally, but a guy I was playing with did. We were playing with bots and he couldn't see any of them. I could see them however, so I'm not sure what might have caused that.I know I just spent a paragraph stating the bugs I've bumped into, but I would still recommend the game. It is definitely a lot of fun and I hope the VR community picks up this one. I bumped into one of the devs earlier today and he was going out of his way to find out what was wrong and what needed changing, so I have high hopes for what they'll do to patch the game up. If you enjoy fast paced shooters, give this one a shot!"

I think it's a little over priced at the moment, even with the 40% discount, but I've definitely had fun playing it. It's a very good idea and their ""PRO"" locomotion method is an interesting way to solve the movement problem for an FPS shooter, although it takes quite a bit of getting used to. I also liked being able to communicate verbally with my team by gripping the left controller and everyone by gripping the right.I'm sure they're going to add more content in the near future to make the price better value for money but as it stands you can have almost as much fun playing the paintball maps in 'Rec Room' for free. However, the movement and the action of loading and reloading weapons makes this more interesting from a gameplay standpoint than Rec Room's paintball.On the down side I've noticed that I've had judder issues after prolonged play.

The problem?  There are almost no players.  I've tried playing multiple times throughout the day, and the most players I saw at any given point were 4.  A 4/8 full server being the only server in the entire game.Now- The game does have singleplayer bots.  This ideally should be its saving grace.  However, not only are your teammates absolutely useless, but the enemy bots are given some kind of privilege by being given a god gun of some sort.  I'm confused- it takes nearly an entire ak-47 clip for me to kill an enemy, so why the hell are enemies able to shoot me *literally* with one single bullet and kill me the second I make eye contact with them?? It's ridiculous.Many people complained about the initial 30$ price tag, which I agree would not have been worth it.  For 18$ now, though?  It WOULD be worth it, if it actually had either an online community or smart bots.  I'm refunding this game because it doesn't.  Maybe once it's out of early access it'll garner an actual community?  I'd probably re-buy the game (ironically) if that happens, because it's honestly *AMAZING.* I love it.

But that's personal preference.+ Performance. Unlike Onward, it runs flawlessly on my ancient i7 870 with a GTX970.+ Pretty much everything is physics based.+ Short downtimes between rounds, in a working shooting range (which lacks the option to reset though, so if all the magazines available are spent, you're down to flingin things)+ You can climb.+ You can attach magazines, weapons and items pretty much everywhere on your bodyNow the cons:- The controls. Several things work radically different than in other VR shooters, which makes getting used to, and switching between games with different controls awkward. Pressing the d-pad and the trigger to attach a gun to your holster led me to both accidentally shoot and drop the magazine instead of putting the gun away.- The locomotion. You basically ""grab"" the air with the menu button. The upside: it  prevents motion sickness. Downsides: Movement is very jerky, due to an inertia based system, you easily overshoot, while simultaneously always feel like your moving to slow and there's no way you can both move and do something else at the same time. It feels like a mixture between crosscountry skiing and a wheelchair.- some ironsights don't work (the M16 and the Mac-10)- the price. Right now, I say it's worth the price of 16,79€, as it's going to expand. But 27,99 is way too much, even with more maps and guns."

The multiplayer is so much fun they just added competitive mode which makes it even more fun when you start to get good at it. I really like how fast paced the game is(fast for VR but not as fast ad twitch based FPS's).

The first being the realistic graphical style. They did a pretty good job with it, but it still causes a problem with identifying friend or foe if they aren't within a certain range. Plus, I find the more simplistic approach just generally more aesthetically pleasing at this stage in VR. The Art of Fight also makes this less of an issue by switching between male and female avatars between offense and defence which are a little bit easier to tell apart, while still keeping it more on the fair side by not having an overall color that sticks out too much more than the other. My other gripe with Onward is the waiting around. If you're not a fan of the campy play style you mind find yourself waiting around more often than not. This is something they could fix by adding some type of respawn mode but The Art of Fight doesn't have this problem nearly to the same degree currently. It's just a generally more fast paced experience.I'm not trying to knock on Onward either or anything but those are a few problems that I was glad to see didn't exist in this game. It's a fun game in its own right but I think this one here will probably be taking up more of my time as it stands now. I was gonna wait for a sale at first but when I read that the devs were proably going to change the price I went ahead and took a chance on it for 30. I still think that's maybe a little too high for an early access game with a lack of variety in scenary and such but I decided I liked it enough to not go for the refund and show a little extra support for the people making good content in these important times for the genre.

The locomotion has a minor learning curve but it feels good once you are used to it.

It's so fast paced and arcade-y and the movement system is so satisfying, but I'm not naturally prone to motion sickness so it doesn't cause any issues for me. Think of it as CS:GO VR. I can't wait to see what comes next!"
,Recommended,531270,25970118,"Posted: 10 October, 2016",all,Gear,Loved the first half hour of play. As you'll read there are some references that can be made to onward. Both are fun. I'd say if they would add movement via the left thumbpad as with onward this would be the perfect fast pace fps for me. For now the movement is fine but feels finicky and slightly frustrating. I often ended up feeling weird when having to let go of my weapon with my lefthand to steer my movement.Otherwise this game is kinda fun and pretty well polished for a easyacces game.

I spent 120 euros on battlefield 1. i have put 7-800 hours int battlefield 4. I spent 12.50 on the art of fight and if you asked me which i would rather play between the three based off 2 hours of art of fight i would pick it hands down.Is it a perfect game. Not at all. But it is VERY VERY FUN. In a way regular games are not. If you have gone paintballing or laser tag or airsoft larping then the experience is much much closer to that than playing a regular game. Your whle body reacts to whats happening. It's fantastic. For the record i prefer the onward style pad motion to the pro motion. benefit of pro motion currently is it lets you climb.I have tried to contextualise what maks this game so continuously fun and compelling and this is the best i can come up with. When you play a game like battlefield , you are operating a perfect soldier through the interface of a mouse or controller. That perfect soldier will always reload in x.x seconds with weapon y. They will always take x.x seconds to switch weapons. When they put something in their crosshair, generally speaking they will hit it.None of this is true in this game, and it makes every single aspect of the game better for it in a way that a non VR game and even some vr games cant. I can talk about it, but until you are literally fumbling for your last pistol mag while taking cover, with a sliver of health left, and you drop the mag in a panic and feel the rush of OH ♥♥♥♥ chemicals beign released into your brain you wont get it.Buy it."

At first it took me a while to get used to the locomation but after I did it made it really fun.  I did feel like I got a little sick when I first started playing at first but once i got used to the movements It was actully fine.  It felt like real life.  AT times I would have to pause and take a breath in the game to get my barrings and scout the enemies.   Such and immersive game.  However,  I will say this game is great but has a lot more potential.  This game feels like just the beggining.  I feel there could be more and they will probably give us more.  This game has a lot of possiblities.  IT is very much like ONWARD which I like but more fast past.  ITs similar but has its differances.  I am glad I have both Onward and this game."

,Recommended,531270,30367671,Posted: 6 March,all,RockItDontStopIt,"This game is fantastic and has REALLY shaped up since it went early access. The movement system is the most fun and intuitive one i've used yet, and being able to run across rooftops and climb around on most things is awesome. The guns feel great and being able to handle everything ambidextrously is a huge plus for me. Being left eyed, but right handed... use rifles like a lefty and pistols like a righty. The game is tons of fun and has that fast arcadey counterstrike feel, AND one of the maps is a clear tribute to dust2. Being a multiplayer shooter though, its lacking a little bit in player base. I've played more than a whole day in this game and i gotta say, its worth your money. We just need more ppl to realize this so we have more to play with!"

76561197997405369,Recommended,531270,29289840,Posted: 15 January,all,SmugJack,7/10. It is a good game. The game is insanely fun and feels like a more lowkey Counter Strike. It has an interesting locomotion system where you move your controllers to move. It even allows you to climb which gives some interesting verticallity to the game. It is also not mil-sim like Onward which is a plus in my book.It is help back by a few things. The game lacks polish and has some minor balance issues. There are many things in the game that just doesn't flow right. It suffers alittle from a small playerbase but I have no problems finding games when I want too. I recommend this game if you are a fan of Counter-Strike.
