76561198085294888,Not Recommended,531530,29839972,Posted: 10 February,all,Calcifer,"I want to like this game. I really, REALLY do. It has potential to be a fairly decent addition to anyone's library. But at the moment (2/10/2017) I just can't recommend Polygod. Let's talk about why.The good-Interesting ""blessing"" system where you purchase buffs to change your weapon in unique ways.-The buffs can interact with each other, similar to The Binding of Isaac.-Rewards high skilled players.-Decent amount of content for a game at it's stage.-Multiple characters to unlock and play.The bad-Certain buffs have massive problems with each other.-Buffs are not explained well at times, making you expect one thing and end up with something much worse.-While levels are randomly generated, everything in each level looks and feels exactly the same.-Enemy variety is very poor.-Why can we get on the top of the walls in the Garden of Gaia? Seriously, it feels unintentional but it's so easy there's no way it's an accident.-The bosses are difficult beyond the point where they should be, and in a way that can be easily exploited with one or two buffs. And no, before you say it, I'm not just being a little ♥♥♥♥♥. Bullet sponges are not fun. Running around a sphere hoping you can run fast enough for 5 minutes trying to avoid infinite rockets is not fun. Trying to hit the first boss, which can fly incredibly quickly (and there can be more than one) with bullets that have a really, really slow travel time IS NOT FUN.-Specific buffs take away any form of challenge to the point where if I don't have one or two of around 7 buffs by the first boss (OUT OF 75) I just start over, while the rest of the buffs are either weak, useless, way too expensive, or detrimental.-Those ♥♥♥♥ing blue shrooms. Just....just no. That explosion radius is not okay.-While some of the characters are interesting, it feels like the developer just thought up some random♥♥♥♥♥♥without thinking of deeper lore and slapped it in. There's just no depth.-Some enemies have extremely annoying attacks.-Lots of glitches, which is a weaker point as the game is in early acces.-Enemy pathfinding is awful.-Never found a multiplayer server.-I'm not even going to say it has a tough difficulty curve because everything depends on your buffs. Sometimes you just get screwed.-Every time you die you have to go back to the title screen (unless you want to play the same map over and over again which kind of ruins the point of a randomly generated game) and walk through a small hallway to actually get to the gameplay. Which sounds like I'm just nit picking, but when death is fairly common it should be a very quick wait to get back into the action.-Some enemies are far too difficult for how soon you can encounter them.-Sound effects are somewhat poor, but not awful.-Going through the later levels just evolves to you standing on a high point and sniping everything you can see until you reach the boss.-Boss fights are one of 3 things. You destroying them in 20 seconds, a long and painful fight that lasts 15 minutes, or them ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on you because you didn't get anything good.If someone asked me if I could recommend a game where the pro-to-con ratio was roughly 1:4, it would be absolutely not. So here we are. Ultimately, this game needs a major balance fix, more enemies, and a better UI before it should even be considered by anyone, even those who can appreciate a tough learning curve. However, should these issues be fixed Polygod will be a good game, perhaps even a great one. Keep an eye on this game, and be patient for the day when it is improved.Final note, if I am incorrect or you have a differing opinion (or just want to ♥♥♥♥♥ at me) please comment so I can edit this post."
76561198072680595,Recommended,531530,31914315,Posted: 23 May,all,benvlieg,"POLYGOD is a great game. It is a rogue-like first person shooter. Unlike othere games in this genre POLYGOD is really really good. The developers listen to the community and regular updates the game. They frequently make changes to the game balancing when enough players requests it.The game itself has an old school feel to it. The gun is in the middle bottom of the screen (like the original doom). Each enemy a specific attack pattern. The levels are randomly generated. Usually this means poor level design but with POLYGOD this is really well done. The levels has a seed that can be adjusted by the player. The games blessings (will come to that shortly) is attached to the seed so each run will be the same with the same seed. There is also a daily dungeons for competing against other players. The blessings is basically a power ups. They are bought using souls, that s acquired from killing enemies. The power ups are great, varied and the more powerfull power ups usually have a down side, for balancing purposes. A great touch is that each power up affected the look of the gun. The graphics are simple low poly style graphics with no textures. This style works really well. POLYGOD is definitely worth the asking price at the moment. Great gameplay and a responsive developer make this game one of the few Early Access games thats worth the risk.P.S. Bonus points for splitscreen co-op on pc."

The developer is active and dedicated to regular updates, as well as being open and receptive to community feedback. All this game needs is to keep expanding the content and improving the overall experience, and it could become basically a cleaner, more colorful FPS version of Binding of Isaac.Also, Brontes is the best NPC character <3"
,Recommended,531530,28460976,"Posted: 18 December, 2016",all,IcerM,"This game is quite honestly the most immersive FPS I've ever player, and I've even played CS:GO, so that's really saying something. Even still, however, I am obliged to list a couple of cons at this point since I'm stating the pros as well. Let's start with the many, many good things about this game.Pros:-Unique upgrade system called 'blessings'-Bosses (dubbed Holy Champions) are very fun to fight-Many different playable characters you can unlock-More than 4 worlds to explore-The same amount of Holy Champions as there are worlds-""Boss Blessings"" that give you unique abilities only unlockable or aquirable after beating a Holy Champion-A varitey of enemies to utterly obliterate...or skip a few of them, I don't know, do what you want-A brutal - AND I MEAN BRUTAL - difficulty curve (This can be a pro OR a con depending on if you like a challenge)-And so much more that I can't even list it all!Now, on to the cons...or rather, scarcity of cons:-There is a severe shortage of multiplayer servers to join-Those floating orb things in the Garden of Gaia that have turrets on all sides of them are the BANE OF MY EXISTENCE!!!-It takes too much time to unlock something in the altars of Death (or whatever they're called)-If you play Faceless the Feeble, you're going to have a BAD TIME (https://memegenerator.net/instance/74060432)That's it!If I had to rate this game on a scale of 1-10, I'd rate it a 9/10. This game is flat-out amazing and almost no cons exist in it. There are a few annoying things in it, however, and a couple of glitches I would like to report: If you use the Laser Shots boss blessing or the Dragon's Breath boss blessing before the next room of rest, it will say the cooldown's over, but you won't be able to use it at all, and for some reason when I used the Random Swop with nothing but Fall Boots, the effect of the Fall Boots lingered for a while afterward. Oh, and, I fell through the world one or two times. The creator might wanna fix that, but it doesn't happen often at all. That's all I have to say, and I wish you good luck on achieving godhood, my friends! :)"
,Not Recommended,531530,32835672,Posted: 26 June,all,Doom721,"Multiplayer was region locked because it uses Unity servers so unfortunately I couldn't experience multiplayer with overseas friends at all. I did contact the devs, and found that I could play with other people in the US, just not my overseas pals. Its EA so I can't give too much♥♥♥♥♥♥ but for a massively multiplayer update I was let down on that component entirely, and was the reason of purchase.The other issue I have is the projectile amount, with certain loadouts the amount of particles are computer demolishing and there is no hard limit it seems to how many you can acquire. 2x, 3x, 4x 5x bullets, with more bullets that trail, that split into three, that have subsonic waves. The amount of projectiles and performance of them is really obnoxiously bad and left for some really awkward balance by my longest playthrough to the final boss.The entire screen was filled to the brim and I could clear the entire map with 5-10fps destroying my CPU @ 4.7ghz on an i7. Definitely needs some balancing/tuning/performance work because for a rougelite fps the balance wasn't there at all it felt like, you either went mega-clear with high damage or you didn't.I'd say wait a bit until it gets polished up, but avoid if you are looking for long-distance coop as its pretty much built in to not work, or show games half the time, and I'm not the only person who dropped into the Discord to check if the damn thing would work."

Upon Early Access release, I was offered a free copy but refused, it deserved my money.Roguelikes typically struggle to find the right equilibrium between hard and easy. Polygod manages to find this centre excellently, allowing it to be accessible while still challenging.A great FPS and roguelike."

The gameplay is really fast and easy to jump right into. You have one gun that you upgrade throughout a run and you can come out having some pretty crazy combos. You can also upgrade yourself with passive buffs or even more health. It can get pretty crazy at times because everything is moving so fast but the chaos is part of the fun. The game does have permadeath so if you die you start from the beginning. It is in Early Access but the dev seems pretty diligent about completing and making the game better.So yeah I recommend this one for sure!  :)"

Support these Devs and this is a great start of a game as well!I've not played too much into the game, but this style and gameplay is what I'm going for. I've played 1000s of hours on Binding of Isaac between PC, Vita, and PS4. I absolutely love these styles of random generated  dungeon crawling rogues. This one give a bit of the fast pace feel that binding has.  For this price I'd recommend a buy.  Hopefully they will be adding more features and creatures."

,Recommended,531530,28476820,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,Sambo,"Great fun! Good procedural maps and enjoyable bullet-hell style gameplay. Extremely challenging as well. Great variety of enemies, bosses and environments.Main gripe however, is the AI. Needs work at this current state. Enemies often get stuck behind walls and seem to have no idea how to properly traverse the arenas. Hopefully that gets fixed soon. Also, a bit of balancing would be welcome in my opinion. The enemies on mission 2 are a fun balance, but by mission 3 they become bullet-sponges. It's quite odd to have such tiny enemies take a ridiculous amount of bullets! Combine that with some of their wild behaviours and it makes for some slightly frustrating gameplay.I know I've mostly listed cons, but overall the pros far outweigh them. It's great to hop on and blast away at many weird and wonderful enemies and bosses. Definitely worth picking up!"
76561198320000022,Recommended,531530,26399895,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,sufyaan,PolyGod is the best game made this year! Its addictive and provides hours of entertainment. It is very challenging but rewarding game. It took me hours to finally beat the first level boss but the accomplishment I got when I did it can’t be put into words. The best thing about this game is that there is always more to look forward too. when I finally beat the first level boss I aimed to do it again but this time without power-ups and I did it! The game is randomly generated and there are dozens of power ups so each time you play it’s a new experience. The game also has a cool multiplayer aspect so you can play with your friends all over the world! I highly recommend this game to all gamers especially Dark Souls and Binding of Isaac fans.
76561198019216815,Recommended,531530,30344080,Posted: 5 March,all,Crebmen,"Polygod is a first-person-shooter rogue-lite with a strong focus on upgrading the crap out of your gun and fighting a ton of enemies who shoot bullets everywhere.While I do think that Polygod is quite enjoyable to play and has a lot of potential to be a great game on launch, it has its fair-share of issues that seem to come with most rogue-likes.First of all, your enjoyment and success in Polygod seems entirely hinged around getting lucky and finding the best upgrades. There is a bit of skill and game-knowlege involved but for the most part the game becomes a boring slog if you don't have the right gear to take on enemies and bosses, especially during the later levels.The game's difficulty curve also seems to be a bit wonky at the moment. The first boss is a run-killer while the later ones don't seem to be quite as difficult in comparison and can be easily cheesed.Of course Polygod is in early access, so pretty much everything about the game is bound to be changed or improved. The developers seem to be very respondant towards community suggestions and complaints so I believe that the game is in good hands.PROS:- Fun and fast-paced gameplay.- A clean and pleasing visual-style.- Good soundtrack.- Interesting and varied weapon-upgrades.- Lots of potential.- Great for listening to podcasts while playing.CONS:- Enjoyability is hinged on luck.- Level-generation is currently a bit limited.- Difficulty curve is very uneven and takes a sudden spike.SCORE: 7/10"

Initially it was the design and graphics that sucked me in, then the music, but as I got a little deeper an entire universe opened up. Something unique, mysterious and other worldly. This is not your indie-industry-standard run of the mill FPS rogue-like. Hardly! The layers, the narratiive, the design, the music, the power-ups, all come together to deliver a mind bending, brutally challenging, fun game.

Otherwise I'm a huge fan of these kind of games. I recommend it to anyone that does not have this problem. That said I find the art style to be a mixed bag, the models seem a bit like generic assets yet the artstyle is pleasing to my eyes overall. It also has the usual unity microstutter despite maintaining 144fps/hz vsync refresh with gsync. As per usual, unity is smooth when looking around however walking creates a juddery feeling."

Polygod is a breath of fresh air from the norm of modern games it takes me back to the likes of games like space station silicon valley and having played rogue-likes and other games similar to this its really captivating and endearing. Having 80+ hours in risk of rain I'm sure I'll be putting just as much if not more time into this game. It's a beautiful game with great mechanics, clever upgrade systems, and a very unique art style that almost has a dreamy look to it. Am looking forward to the future of this game and am hoping that playing with friends is just as fun if not more fun than single player."
,Recommended,531530,33809647,Posted: 26 July,all,All American Bad Boy,"Polygod is a FPS Roguelike that plays like a mixture of Quake and Dark Forces where the gameworlds are procedural. They're misleadingly easy at first, but once you get passed the first boss, the heat is on. Visuals are good, game world lacks atmosphere a little bit but other than that, great little game, still being worked on."
,Recommended,531530,33937503,Posted: 31 July,all,Oxigin,"Checked the demo out at EGE2017 and had a great chat with one of the lead devs. Amazing team with passion for their project and truly want to make it as good as they possibly can in anyway they can, including taking suggestions from us, the fans.In the small amount of time I played the game at the expo, as well as in my own time, I can say their hard work has paid off.Polygod isn't particularly unique within the fast-paced, Quake-style FPS genre, BUT it does offer some really interesting tweaks to the formula, as well as extremely polished and well balanced gameplay for an early access title, and, while I haven't gotten too far into the game because I suck hardcore at it, I can say it's definitely worth the current asking price on concept and execution alone, and depending on how much is added in the full release, it'll definitely still be worth a bit more.What I find really refreshing about the game is it's difficulty. It never feels like the game is cheating me, but rather I'm just really bad at it and I need to improve myself to make it easier. It doesn't hold your hand through anything. You're just dropped into one of the randomly generated worlds, given your gun and set off to go shoot things. There is a story going on from what I can tell, but as I haven't even gotten past the first boss, I have not seen much of it.Overall though, I purchased this  game, not only because it's well made, well balanced and fun as all balls, but because talent like this from the South African game dev scene need all the support they can get.I'll definitely reccommend Polygod to all my mates, as well as stay active within the community because I see great potential in this titles future as both a LAN favourite and even eSports title.Krafted Games, keep up the good work! We're counting on you!!"
