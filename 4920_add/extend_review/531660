76561198004192004,Recommended,531660,32310460,Posted: 10 June,all,ZOMBOT ︻デ══一,"I currently have close to 9.4 hours in the game, and I'm at the current 'end.'  As such, I'll provide my thoughts thus far:1st question most ask, is it worth buying?  In its current state, at 10 hours of gameplay, that's a tough sell, but having a chance to perhaps have some input on how the final product turns out may be the tipping point for some.I've had fun.  I've thought about this game between sessions, which is usually a good indicator that it's interesting enough, even in its current Alpha state, to keep me guessing.  I really hope this winds up as a completed project (have seen a few Alphas sputter and die, let this not be one!)Gameplay: Nothing amazing yet, but nothing to complain about, either.  Feels a bit like it could become an MMO, though I am kind of torn about whether it should be or not.Caveat:  If there's a project plan/roadmap, I haven't seen it or read it.  It may answer some of this.Inventory/Gathering - First, for the reader, this game is still very much alpha.  It seems that currently, inventory is unlimited, but you can sell almost nothing.  I would guess/hope/assume that this will change significantly as the game develops.  Note for the developers - stopping for 4 seconds to shove a melon in your face, or 1 second to pick up every single item from the ground, feels a bit tedious.  While I understand for realism, one can't grab on the run, something, perhaps the animation or mechanic, needs to be tweaked to make the pleasure of finding a 'field' of melons less overshadowed by the dread of the time it will take to pluck each one.'Guns' - They aren't too impressive yet, but they are showing an interesting diversity in both traditional firearms and new/alien tech.  (Fun note, the projectiles are still a bit on the slow side).Armor - Currently available armor,up to 20 chest and 20 pants, while a bit expensive, renders the player almost invulnerable.  As the game expands, I would hope that this would scale a bit more, and better armor wouldn't become available until later.Leveling - Currently very limited.  I'm hoping this will eventually expand into a skill tree of some sort.  This ties in with my next point.""Survival"" - Currently, there's nothing truly survival about this game.  Within 10 minutes, I had more water and food then I used the rest of the game.  Most gatherable items that were sellable simply became another, albeit slow, way to make money.  Again, hoping that as the game expands, the survival aspect may increase (if you put the tag on it, people want the threat of death to be, or least to feel, imminent).Critters - So far, I like the diversity.  Much of the creatures feel similar enough, but varied as one might expect on an Earth-like planet.  Hoping to see many more species as time goes on (the loading screen promises quite the variety!).Quests - Honestly, these need a lot of work.  Some of it was not intuitive at all, and there was a bit of frustrating wandering.  As above, if this is a survival game, I'm not looking for a shiny beam of light to guide me to everything, but 'look for drag marks' on cracked desert with no discernable drag marks was a bit aggrivating.Crafting is also still very Alpha, but the fact that it exists at all gives me hope.  There are a myriad of crafting games developing right now, and I hope this one doesn't skimp on this aspect.Sounds/Soundtrack - Isn't bad, doesn't detract from the game at all, and feels 'Westerny'.  Some of the random ambient noises are a bit odd, and sometimes make you think a bitebug is about to attack, but again, not bad.Visuals - So far, I'll say this is probably the most promising aspect of the game.  The floating crystals that actually cast their colors on the ground below as the sun moves is great, and much of the flora and water is awesome, especially considering this is an alpha.  It honestly looks better than a couple of 'finished' games I've played.Last, a burning question: Does the scope of this game ever intend to leave the planet?Thank you for reading.  If you have any questions or comments, please let me know/feel free to add."
76561198011357793,Recommended,531660,32058365,Posted: 30 May,all,Smokerunner,"I like this game.I would give it three stars now with a potential for four or five on its release date.   It offers about 10 hours of actual gameplay.   Every content update increases this playability time.  It has huge potential for expansion as well.First thing to note: It is in the early stages of early access.If you do not like incomplete and unpolished games then you should [follow] game and return in a few months. They add new content and updates every month.  I enjoy the game now, though I look forward to future additions of content to improve the longterm gameplay.  It is surprisingly less buggy than I expected for an early access game.It is a Space WesternIf you like space westerns or like the Badlands series then  you will like this.  You can tell the dev's and writers put a lot of work to make that theme shine through and it shows.   As an early access game the optimiztion needs a little work, but that is to be expected.  The textures and the landscapes are beautiful.  The cultures and creatures you interact with are also interesting.  I am curious to see where the writers go with them as the long term story is implemented.Take negative reviews with a grain of salt.This game is evolving.  I saw some negative reviews from December, and could totally understand the perspective of the reviewers then.  But the content has been updated a lot since then, the game offers a richer experience now than it did back then.  I imagine in September of 2017 it will be vastly improved from today and so on until it is released."
,Recommended,531660,33439001,Posted: 10 July,all,Tess,"I have to admit I LOVE this game.  The dialog, the world, how it starts all add up to a must have game for me.  I can't wait to play it fully fleshed.Things I love off the top of my head?- ALL the little hidey holes.  OMG the caves, the waterfalls, the nooks and crannies and finding hidden loot.  :)- The dialog.  Shiny.- No fancy gimics or specials on the shooting.  Aim and fire.  Like it should be.- Maps as well maps.  No blinking indicators or flashy crap. A map as a map that you have to read.- The World is breathtaking,  the flora is colorful and the critters are wild.Improvements I would suggest?- Make the keys mappable or provide alternate left hand key mappings. (I saw in a post that this will happen, please don't forget it.)- Give me more!!  I want a quest to build legs for Swift Strider, I want to craft with all the loot. Please let me push at least one of the hijackers into the starship engine when I find my ship.- And that brings me to the loot.  Please let me sell the junk.  I am the loot mistress and dropping stuff, well it hurts.- I would like to play as a female. But please don't water it down."
,Recommended,531660,28313645,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,Luxbu | Game Gamut,"I have been looking for an EA game like this for a very long time, like since The Forest or 7 Days. Even though Exoplanet is EA, it has been backed and fully funded on Kickstarter.Check out the full review here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK3EQH46y_YExoplanet is going to take a lot of time and commitment and the dev team definitely sounds up for the challenge. As of build v0.15.0, the game will give you around 5-7 hours of gameplay. You will most likely get around 10 hours of solid gameplay once some of the known bugs, which hinders story progession, is fixed.What drew me in was the vision the Devs (Alersteam) hasfor this game, as well as their sources of inspiration. They've taken in some of my favorite games that inspired the core of this game with classic titles such as Elder Scrolls lll: Morrowind, Fallout, Red Dead Redemption, and Borderlands. There are some notable TV shows and films that inspired their characters in the game as well. What is going to keep me around this game is when I read up on the Devs and read their vision of a what a good RPG is. I recommend hitting up their website and browsing their board.Pros:+Dialogue. It is entirely text based and critical to the success of this game. Exactly like TES lll: Morrowind, you have to listen and respond accordingly to learn more about your quest or more about the world and how you could impact it. You also have decisions during interaction that can change your world.+Rich, open world with intricate systems to explore, all of which rewards your efforts. You have to pay attention to detail if you want to see the whole thing.+In reference to the above, it helps to catch some little critters that you can use to scout!+The game rewards players who love to explore every cave and crevice. It doesn't have any bare spots, which EA devs often do.+Awesome devs who work feverishly on updating their bugs and glitches. They listen and respond very promptly.+Sound. I'm actually impressed with the ambience+Plenty of loot and items to be found+Complex quest lines and side missions where completion depends on your journal and ability to pay attention in dialogue.+Text based story line, down to the trading. Most notably, from what I found is the selective trading. What I mean by that is I have to know the NPC's that will accept certain items, much like Morrowind is. This really helps emerge you into the story line and fits nicely with what the devs are trying to do here.+Night and day cycle with fauna that grows and blooms real time.This next part, take with a grain of sand. It's an EA game and this game wasn't created overnight. After years of development, they're ready to improve.Cons:-As of now, the game mentions an RPG system to develop your character. It is not available in its current version.-Crafting. I debated whether this should be a pro or a con, because I like the idea and I know it's only going to get better. You can craft items for quests and things for your inventory. Some of the things you can make are pretty sweet! However, it is very limited and the current version doesn't have a single NPC teach you a new recipe. For that, it is currently a con.-Combat. It isn't terrible or game breaking, but it's definitely not perfect. Some monsters bug out and you can kill some big game quite easily when they get stuck. It's easy to kill with weapons, but on the flip side ammo is scarce and I was using a mix of melee and shooting. It's easy to buy more ammo, but there are better things to save your money for.-Trading. Trading is meh, it's a bit time consuming when selling a lot of things. You also can't sell specific items, so it stacks up in your inventory. The lack of crafting recipes or any sort of guide can cause a cluttered inventory. All that said, I really like that it is text based.-Graphic/FPS issues - I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCEd THIS IN ANY WAY. I thought it would be worth mentioning as others have noted this, and it is probably due to their vast, open world. Some peasants haven't been able to handle that! ;)With that, I want to remind everyone who's playing or going to play that this game is not just an EA game. It's built on chapters and we're getting just chapter 1. This brings about 10 hours of gameplay. For the price, it's entirely up to you if it's worth the purchase. To me, it is. In it's current state though, you might get a little less 8 hours. This is only because of some of the dialogue and interaction issues which impacts end game stuff. By the time you read this, it might already be fixed.I made a negative review initially because the game had a game breaking save issue, and within 5 hours the devs fixed it. They have also fixed plenty of other bugs and glitches in the 48 hours this game has been released.I absolutely look forward to continue playing every update, which is almost daily at this point, and seeing this game evolve."

Sure, it's Early Access, so it's rough around the edges at the moment, but it is quite playable and the content is improving with time.  I don't regret buying it even as it is now, and look forward to future additions!"

So I have absolutely no idea what im doing other than running around a planet looking for loot, I like looting.Maybe im nuts, its highly possible, but it seems like a lot of the things you 'happen' across seem to be part of a larger puzzle.  Its not just some blood stain leading into a cave, there is a back story to it, you just have to find it.Even though this game is far from finished... I am highly satisfied with this game."

Literally.The graphics were meh.The camera/character control was poor.The gameplay was uninspiring.Absolutely nothing convinced me it was worth keeping. So I refunded.Since the dev was whihing lets expand on this.1: You are dumped into some random junk heap. No explanation, no basic tutorial.2: There are next to no customization options for a game he has touted as having as much content as morrowind.3: The animations are stilted, the flash video on the store page is accurate in that respect.4:The canyon you start in is your typical empty open space, with a few loot containers and a few baddies. If you are going to give me an open world, it better be more interactive, otherwise I WILL just drop the title and go back to one that looks and feels nice, like the ones Bethesda gives us.5: An early access title for $20 had better be ready to make a case for itself being WORTH $20 if you want people to keep it.I probably would have given this title another chance later on, it was still on my follow list.

The issue regarding start up seems to be fixed as well, but this was following the deletion of the Alersteam file in My Documents.I played the same portion I did during my first video to test the concerns I had regarding frame rate issues and appear to still be unable to maintain anything above 30 with an average of 23. The graphics menu is still non-existent, with the only options being a sound slider, view distance slider and an option for Triple Buffering. The game really needs a resolution preset selection, which might help with the frame rate issue. I also ran into major graphical issues when I turned off Triple Buffering, so I would advise keeping it on. Clipping is also an issue, mostly from furniture.Content is where the majority of the issues seems to stem. The only bits of story I managed to acquire involved the reason for the protagonist's arrival on K'Tharsis and the instructions to reach a fort. Dialog outside of this was limited to a few sellers, some quest givers and that is about it. Most NPCs in the Fort and the encampment outside the bridge were either mimicking the same lines, saying they were busy or being unresponsive. Quests are available in short supply (I have run into four) with the last one not registering on the journal page when accepting it from the alien near the waterfall. A terminal outside the Fort also lists a few NPC bounties and a single quest involving a special bite bug, but I have yet to find a NPC I could kill. The world is explorable to a point (some natural and man made barriers block off passages) and includes killable monsters for food.This is where the survival aspects come in, which have a hefty regard for food consumption. I spent a great deal of time killing everything I could to sate my appetite while I noticed my desire for water barely dropping past 90%. You can cook up meat to be more effective which is where the crafting system comes in. Three diagrams are available by the looks of it, but I did some testing and managed to make items not listed. Completed items can also be deconstructed for their parts.Visually the game has some issues, most coming from the stiff character animations and monster damage feedback. Music is great, albeit extremely limited. Combat is clunky at best with regards to hit detection and range registering. The camera is also very floaty, something that could be improved by a mouse sensitivity option. Controls are not customizable, but you are able to see the key layout using the HELP option in the game menu.My non-recommendation is based primarily on the amount of content available for the price tag and secondarily to the pesky bugs that still exist. I understand this is an alpha build, but it would be a good idea to wait and see how the story will be implemented considering the importance it will have.This has been a EAW PSA.- Original PSA -I apologize for the lack of information regarding this title, but as you can see from the video, the game crashed as I was attempting to save in front of the fortress and now I am unable to start the game. This is following two restarts, a reinstall and a complete reboot of Steam (full exit, full log in).From what I did play, the game is barely able to stay around 25 FPS and the camera is highly sensitive. The lack of primary options such as resolution (or presets for that matter) doesn't help matters. There is no key map listing either, so simple functions such as camera adjustment, journal pop up and the ""loot search"" function are discovered by trial and error.I am currently trying to get the game to work again following the save-crash-rejection problem I am having, for now I recommend staying clear of this one until some of these issues are addressed.This has been a EAW PSA."
