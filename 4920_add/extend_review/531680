I bought this hoping to take my time building a force and experimenting only to find that NO you cannot do that, you must complete all levels in the fastest time possible! Arrrrgh what is it with modern games why can't they be more strategy based not speed based?  I'm so dissappointed with this that I'm seriously thinking of building a pc and playing all my win 98 SE games instead of this modern crap at least the old games provided longevity and a challenge..If I'm being too harsh then please let me know otherwise if you want a game that even on the hardest setting you can still complete the mission objectives in under 5 mins then this is the rubbish to buy!  If you find any POSITIVE write ups for this game, will you please ask them how much they're getting payed to say nice things about this rubbish!"
,Recommended,531680,28410365,"Posted: 16 December, 2016",all,sam,"8-Bit Invaders takes Petroglyph’s funky Lego-looking RTS game series into space, and if you liked the 8-Bit series up to now then you’ll like this. While the core game actually has an impressive amount of content, this isn’t really a game that’s meant to be played by itself. You’re meant to play it with the other two 8-Bit games, Armies and Hordes, which when combined give you a glorious six factions to mess around with on dozens of beautiful included maps plus whatever the community can come up with. Underneath that, the basic RTS mechanics remain the same, but with plenty of twists to make it distinct from its predecessors such greater stealth, unit armor, and the new “Conquer the Multiverse” mode for a long-term campaign of progression.8-Bit Invaders (and the series as a whole) feels like a giant toy box. There are lots of little bits to amuse yourself with and plenty of whacky fun in Skirmish and Multiverse modes. If you already have the other 8-Bit games, then you can’t go wrong with this one. It’s a solid entry bursting with personality. If you’re new to the series then this is an excellent point to jump in. It’s surprisingly good as a standalone game, but the real enjoyment of the 8-Bit games comes from having all of them together. Sure it’s expensive, if you’re willing to take the leap and purchase the others as well then there’s hours of quirky RTS fun to be had in mixing them."

Yeah, you guessed it, the soundtrack by Frank Kle♥♥♥♥♥!To be fair, they did at least try.New features:- Harvesters stay at resource node and continuously mine instead of travelling back and forth for both new factions.- Some gimmicky units and faction differences- Titan unitsThere are 2 new factions, the Marins and the Cranioids. The Marines field pretty much exclusively mechanised units. Even their infantry is mechanized. The theme here is pretty good and cohesive for once. The tech tree on the other hand is really weird. Why do I need a barracks to build anti air turrets, but a tech lab or whatever to build ground defenses (which are slow firing aoe pulse towers with laughable range)? I mostly just skipped the barracks later on alltogether, because the units produced from there are just pointless in big fights. The only real highlight here is a unit they copied from SC2 (the Reaper only with a melee attack), which can jump up and down cliffs, just like its better pendant. They are useless in fights, however, due to their ridiculously low HP, so you either just use them once in the campaign when you're forced to, or maybe to sneak into the enemy base and destroy a key building, which you will most likely also just do in the campaign to suicide win (yes, that's still a thing...no matter how many thousand units are bearing down on your already destroyed base, you still win by just eliminating some key buildings...sigh).Marines also get some air units you will hardly ever use and a big Titan unit that for some reason doesn't attack if units are too close or too far away, even if you give it a move command and even though it can move and attack at the same time. Theoretically a melee unit could kill that Titan without it ever trying to fight back...sigh. Marines are also perhaps the most overpowered faction in the 8-Bit universe so far. Why? Half their HP on buildings and units are self regenerating shields! Especially in small skirmishes with good micro you should always be able to beat an opponent with the same amount of units (or even more and better units). Unless you one shot one of these units they'll just rejoin the fray a few seconds later with almost fully recovered shields. Add to that flying repair units that can thus only be targeted by ground to air units and you have an almost unbeatable army, unless the enemy gets 5 times the number of units to throw at you (in the campaign this happens on almost every one of the later maps). Buildings once again need power by the way, so this is the 3rd faction that builds generators.In contrast the Cranioids are a menagerie of all silly alien beasts you can think of: small green martians, alien xenomorphs (complete with acidic blood that will constant damage all enemy units standing in the pool after a unit is destroyed, which can easily mean they take massive amounts of damage, as everything just clumps up again), War of the Worlds striders, UFOs, bugs and a giant Titan beast reminiscent of a big Ape-Lizard that can wipe out whole armies if you don't pay attention for one second (lingering AOE damage field). This faction once again uses farms and food supply like the Hordes factions. They behave like every other faction in that their units don't auto-regen and have no shields. Run of the mill. Boring in the end. Their healer unit is a giant flying saucer with an aoe heal.The campaign is once again completely uninspired, but to up the difficulty the game just likes to throw hundreds of enemy units at you at every turn. That is not difficulty, it's simply boring and frustrating to get swarmed after 3 minutes by a vast horde of enemy units for the next 5 minutes, after which there is a brief lull of 1 minute before everything gets repeated. Buy it for potential MP only."
76561198262898921,Recommended,531680,29860016,Posted: 11 February,all,Touhou Project,"Just an opening remark: alot of the negative reviews you will see for this game seem to be from 2016 when 8-Bit Armies only had one to two factions and very limited content. Very recently, a multiplayer stand-alone for this game was released called 8-Bit Armies: Arena, which costs $5 and gets you all 6 factions that have been released as of the writing of this review, though multiplayer-only, so I suggest you check that out:I already wrote a review for 8-Bit Armies and 8-Bit Hordes but I'm gonna repeat what I said at the start for 8-Bit Invaders as it applies to this game as well:8-Bit Invaders is the latest throwback to the ""golden-age of Real-Time Strategy"" in the 90's and early 00's, back before Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas like League of Legends were a thing. The gameplay is fairly simple: you build a base, gather resources, mass up units, and throw them at the enemy until one of you are dead. The graphics are designed to be fairly simple to reduce the strain of the game on your PC, particularly with the army sizes the game can reach. Since its initial launch, two other standalone games have been released, 8-Bit Armies and 8-Bit Hordes, which are cross-compatible (meaning you can play the factions against each other), so if you care about single player you might as well get those two as well.The main thing that makes the gameplay unique is that building additional buildings provide a multiplier bonus that stacks infinitely, so while one Barracks will train an infantry unit 100% fast, five Barracks train infantry 500% quickly, ten train 1000% quickly, and so on, allowing you to grow armies to ludicrous sizes quickly. As a consequence, though, even larger games tend to last no more than 10-15 minutes, especially as you get lots of harvesters and resources on the map run out. In addition, random crates spawn when you destroy neutral buildings and objects, giving you effects that range from free units to healing to damaging the unit that collect it, adding a factor of randomness to your games.Like 8-Bit Hordes, 8-Bit Invaders has a single-player campaign of 12 missions in one campaign and 12 missions in another. They are pretty similar in terms of quality, so what I said for 8-Bit Hordes holds true for Invaders.  The missions have more variety to them compared to 8-Bit Armies, but I still wouldn't expect much out of the campaign: the missions still take place on skirmish maps though, there are no cutscenes, and the only story is pre-quest dialogue. The side objectives that reward you with new starting units have become more varied, however, and are easier to obtain as they don't require you to win in a short amount of time.The skirmish mode is pretty good with a decent selection of maps (and much more if you decide to get the expansions). 8-Bit supports up to eight player gameplay, and the AI is pretty good too. Finally, with the launch of 8-Bit Armies: Arena, multiplayer is much more livelier and it's fairly easy to find someone to play with. Replays and observer mode have also been implemented for more competitive players.8-Bit Invaders has two factions: the Marines and the Cranoids, based on sci-fi RTS like Starcraft or Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War.  The Marines use the power system: buildings cost power to maintain, insufficient power reduces their functionality.  The Cranoids use the food system: units cost one food, hitting your food cap stops all unit production until you build more food-producing buildings.  Both factions use harvesters that collect automatically at a resource site without need to return to base, but gathers slowly.  Both factions have two special powers unlocked through their tech structures, and an epic unit automatically spawned at a special building.-The Marines are an expensive, powerful faction (kinda like a hybrid of Terrans and Protoss from Starcraft).  They are unique as their buildings and units are wrapped up in a shield on top of their normal HP that quickly regenerate outside of combat, making them well suited for hit-and-run tactics.  Their epic unit is the Titan, a powerful mech (inspirated by the Terran Thor from Starcraft II) with rocket launchers, a plasma gun, and a heavy cannon that can all fire at the same time.  A great faction for players that like controlling a few, powerful units.-The Cranoids are a more tactical, aircraft-oriented faction (kinda like the Zerg from Starcraft).  Their units tend to be cheaper and more disposable, and tend to lean on their infantry and aircraft.  Their epic unit is the Destroyer, a powerful melee unit that can recover health by eating enemy infantry, fire a burning beam at aircraft, and turn enemies into Xenodogs.  A good faction for players that care about mobility and aggression.The 8-Bit Invaders factions tend to be more expensive and slower, but more powerful than the other two races.  They have the most racial differences between the two sides, so if you just want to buy one 8-Bit game out of the three released with singleplayer, I recommend Invaders as it's the best standalone.Final impressions? 8-Bit Invaders is a great game if you're new to Real Time Strategy in general, as it's simple to learn but hard to master.  I highly recommend it for both fans of older RTS games (particularly Command and Conquer) and newer gamers interested in getting into the genre."
76561198017382987,Not Recommended,531680,29125957,Posted: 8 January,all,Lydia XIII,"So this is the third game in the 8-Bit series, when I first heard about that series I thought it was an awesome idea, I bought all 3 games in the series, it took me a while to play all 3 but recently I have come around to play all 3 of them and the end result for me is I can't recommend either of the games in this series, now I'll admit this one is probably the best of the lot, the two others had one flawed crappy faction, this one is pretty good faction wise, the Marines are mostly based that I seen on Starcraft, while the Cranioids are based on a mix match of beings from various Sci-Fi Movies & Video Games, I can appreciate that much.The problem is a problem that has been around since the first game and I found making a comeback hard in this one, which is namely the tedious grindfest Campaign, no mission should be expecting you on Normal to effectively either have a perfect knowledge of the map and the disposition of the enemy units or to have access to more ressources that you are supposed to have at that point in the game, yet the Campaign expect that out of you, getting 3 Stars on the first run oh every missions, is nigh impossible, the Lightbringers in 8-Bit Hordes were the one faction I actually felt had a well made Campaign, it was completely possible to 3 Stars pretty much any mission on the first run, maybe short of the last one, this one however doesn't offer such a possibility, I am currently playing the first Campaign of this game and its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Between WAY too many crate running, timers and annoying mission objectives that require a stupid amount of efforts while making little to no sense, this game has proven to be as flawed as the previous two on the matter of the Campaign, the Factions themselves are good, the Multiverse mode is a new addition to the series that actually is interest, but the Marine Campaignis bad, I haven't tried the Cranioids yet, but I don't expect any better.It seriously seem for some unspeakable reasons the developers felt the need to artificially bolster the length of the game by forcing you to replay some missions several times to earn all stars, and sometimes the rewards of those missions are required to be able to get the 3 stars on a previous mission, which mean where their is 15 missions you'll be expected to play in total 20+ missions in total to complete the Campaign since you'll need to replay earlier missions to 3 stars them, and that is before going to go for Hard, which pretty much is going to require in many cases to have gotten all the 45 stars on from the missions already, which mean if you want to win them all on hard you'll have 30+ Campaign mission runs. Why? Their is already Skirmish, and in this game Multiverse, why was it felt we need to grind the Hell out of the Campaign to reach full completion that bloody much? I don't know but at this point I can't recommend the game because of that. Sure playing Skirmish, Multiverse or Multiplayer might be fun, if you find much in term of people to play Multiplayer anyway, but I expect all the aspects of a game to be at least descent to recommend it, and this one like the two others failed on the Campaigns.Now I do actually have some complains about the factions of this game too, namely the 'Powers' and the 'Ultimate Unit', in the two previous games each faction had a ultimate offensive power that could be used to wreck havoc, well the Deathsworns had one that isn't great, but for the rest they were pretty good, than in Hordes the two faction had a 'sight' power to allow you to see spots on the map, in this game they powers are... sub-par...The Marines have the Overcharge power that allow them to run faster at the cost of shield and a power that create a zone of Stealth, in campaign, both are mostly useless due to how Campaigns work, Overcharge is pretty useless outside of Campaign too unless you want to send units quickly to a place and you know the path is mostly enemy free, otherwise you get hit brutally, the Stealth power is useful to prepare an ambush, but that is something that is only really effective outside of the Campaign, playing against humans that are capable of strategic thinking and making errors that the AI isn't really made for, still a pretty poor power.The Cranioids in their case have the Drop Point, which unless you have a massive amount of unit buildin structures and produce units at a massive pace, won't allow you to get all that many units to your drop location, the other power is a 'sight' power that can follow enemy units touch, its somewhat useful, but frankly without having a ultimate offensive power to use I find myself not finding that much use for it.For the Ultimate Units, I find them to be a let down, they aren't all that powerful a single use of a ultimate offensive power is capable of doing so much more damage, unless you have a ton of healing units to support them they fall fairly fast, and they attack slowly and not THAT powerfully, the Titan is obviously based on the Thor from Starcraft II, I found it to be meh, without a large army and healers to back it up, its nothing that potent, I'd have prefered to have the typical Terran Nuke. The Destroyer in its case is barely better, if for the amusing Gas it can shoot that turn all infantry to Xenodogs, against a heavy infantry Faction like the ones from Horde it might be pretty useful, but otherwise its own direct offensive capabilities aren't all that great either, overall the unit seem to be based on a fusion between the Chryssalid from XCOM and Godzilla. Anyhow I would have much prefered for them to give us a Ultimate Offensive Power and a Sight power than the ones we got and Ultimate Unit.Considering this was supposed to be develeloped by people that had worked on other major RTS titles I was expecting better than boring tedius grindfest Campaigns, they don't have much in term of storyline, not much in term of fun, its more painful to play than anything. If somebody can overlook the poor campaigns, and a poor faction on each of the previous titles, ignore the low populated Multiplayer, and mostly play Skirmish and Multiverse solo, this might provide some amusement, but I'd warn away from buying this at full price, wait for a good sale before bothering. I was hoping when I originally bought into this series to recapture the feeling I had playings the RTS of old, but frankly it failed to provide me with that satisfaction."

Decent co-op campaign, 2 normal campaigns, plenty of skirmish with steam workshop for more maps after the fact. They deserve your money. They did it right."
,Recommended,531680,28415041,"Posted: 16 December, 2016",all,Cookie,"I've been a fan of the 8-Bit series ever since it first came out, fantastic series and fantastic games. However this one is by far my favorite, me being a big fan of Sci-Fi helps too though. The units seem a lot cooler to me than the ones before, with the plasma rifles of the marines and the little martians, and the whole jumpjet troopers and the mechs, I love it. The multiverse mode is amazing too, and is the biggest reason to buy the game. To give a rundown of what the mode is, there's three maps for it with several little regions on the map. Each region is worth different amounts of income and crystals (You only get the crystals for the first time you capture the area). You use these crystals to upgrade your tech tree. You can only play two factions in this mode, the Crainoids or the Galactic Marines, but on each map you invade (if the other hasn't invaded it already) the occupying force will be an army from one of the other two games, which is a really nice touch. The maps are a mixture of maps from all the games prior in this mode and each region or map can only have three structures for the conquest map view. You can have a defense force of 35 soldiers and an attack force of 75 soldiers. What this boils down to is units you start with on the map, from harvesters to the expensive wyverns, I think it can be any unit, though I haven't tested it with the super units. Another interesting thing is that sometimes when you and the aliens clash along your borders in the Multiverse, a third random faction can sometimes spawn in to fight, there could be more but so far I've only seen one other random faction coming in to join the scrap. To move on to how the super weapons are done in Invaders: They're units, not weapons. The Marines get an awesome giant mech and the aliens get this awesome giant monster, it's really quite cool and an interesting take on super weapons in my own opinion. I haven't played much of the campaign, since I was never really into any of the campaigns in the 8-Bit series (except the horde one for some reason) but the multiverse is amazing and skrimishes are as fun as ever.tl;dr - The game is really cool, the Multiverse is an amazing addition that I love, and it's more of the 8-Bit series and if you like classic strategy games or any of the other 8-Bit series then you won't be disappointed. Total steal for $15 right now and still worth $20 for the multiverse to be honest."

76561197991705909,Recommended,531680,28415869,"Posted: 16 December, 2016",all,JoesGuy,"8-Bit Invaders (perhaps the last entry in the 8-Bit RTS series) is Petroglyph's excellent installment in an already two game strong line-up of superb classic real time strategy games. Those already familiar with these previous games know exactly what they're getting into - An accessible rts experience in the same vein as Command and Conquer, Warcraft 3 and Starcraft. The only real twist beieng the voxel engine used to creat blockly environments and characters.Like Armies and Hordes, the units are very straightfoward to understand. You have infantry, vehincles and resource collectors, and your general goal is to build up your armies and wipe out your opposition. The two new factions are the human marines and the alien Cranioids. Both factions are incredibly unique, in that the marines tend to sway toward early powerful units to crush the enemy with massive firepower (complete with shielded units) and the Cranioids adopt a more hit and run approach early game with more variation in unit types, for example the Xenodogs which are fast moving melee units who leave corrosive puddles of acid blood behind when they die. It all culminates in a slightly different playstyle depending on which faction you choose.Invaders is something of a step up from the previous games in that introduces the multiverse mode; a metagame that has you planning your course of play across a map. Total War and Civilisation players will be right at home here, though it's simplified enough for new players to get to grips with this new mode. Multiple battles will see you gaining and losing ground as you fight back and forth to capture territory.Finally, like all the 8-Bit games, you can play co-op campaigns with friends, challenge other players in multiplayer skirmishes, and mix and match different factions. Yes, if you own Armies and/or Hordes you can play as or against those same factions with the new Invaders factions.Invaders is a wonderful entry in this series. Very old school RTS, very easy to learn, very tough to master, and is bursting with charm, from the pixel graphics to the cheesy sci-fi references. This is a must buy for fans of the genre, though I highly recommend buying all three games together. It's at a discount if you pick them all up, and you'll get the absolute most out of this game if you have the rest."

There is an added mutliverse which functions sorta like a topworld board game and with each zone being a territory you go into actal rts gameplay to fight over. If you own either of the other 2 8-bit games you can add those factions into normal games for a weird futuristic vs fantasy battles. The game has co-op missions but there lacks a playerbase for them so I have never played them, so best get a friend if you want to play them.Would def reccomend, honestly might wanna wait for a sale though and just get all the 8-Bit games at once for the added factions during standard games."

The multiverse aspect is very interesting; I have yet to delve into online MP or the campaign.I think the only slight thing that could improve this game would be mod support. Something akin to the SC2 modding community. Extra units, unique game modes etc, etc.Highly recommend this game, great fun, lovely visuals.

,Recommended,531680,31099442,Posted: 12 April,all,faltHes,"What to say about this one.. well, the core of this release, along with Armies and Hordes, is built on a competent RTS engine. Technically speaking, the game allows for a lot to happen the screen, and the controls work about as expected for a C&C-like. Units are responsive, but micro isn't really rewarded so much. I do wish this series leaned more towards Starcraft's mechanics, but it was a clear design decision to be how it is.Future games in this engine could be improved is if an actual story were introduced. No need for big budget cutscenes or overblown VA.. but really, the one blurb summary above each mission doesn't really do much for me.  We don't need another Kerrigan, but there needs to be some drive for replaying besides having challenges.Again, this game is fun. If you want to play through some bite-size maps without too much depth, but need to scratch an RTS itch, this gets you there.  I hope the developers continue to expand with new releases in the future"
,Recommended,531680,28475663,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,tarkus,"I feel this is the best in the 8 bit series.The invader faction's units are more varied than previous games.This is because most units have some unique qulities to bring to the table as well as having designated roles. Examples include Harpy infantry being able jump over clifs to reach areas. Cranioids tripod being able to see above all elevations giving you a range advantage when fighting on higher or lower ground. The Shriker unit being a designated anti-air superiority fighter and many more examples.The resource gathering mechanics is also much simplifed. You build a harvester and it locks into a resource point and just collects. That means no drop off points or building creeping needed. It kind of gives that control point feeling like in dawn of war where you just secure a specific area rather than worring about destination A to B.The Campaign objectives are better too. The sliver and gold objectives in previous games were commonly do X in X time. Whilst that still present here, it is not so common which means get objectives that let you take your time in doing which i feel is great to vary things up."

76561197982565832,Recommended,531680,29138113,Posted: 9 January,all,Arahmain,"After playing each of the 8 Armies games for a few hours I can honestly say I've enjoyed the time on these as it does hit the nostalgia but also delivers a fairly solid rts game in the style of the classics.Its strength is that it plays like the classics (C&C Westwood, Dune 2000, KKND) its simple, fast, I've not discovered what I would call dud units and if done properly you can build a huge force very quickly and watch a big messy and fun battle play out. Despite the simple art design (all intentional of course) units look fun, feel powerful and are all easily identifiable even once the fighting starts.Armies and Hordes are awarded super weapons to play with and the Invaders factions are provided super units of which I find particularly enjoyable to add to my armies though they do need some protection.So with all this fast paced and fun action what could be wrong with it....Its weakness is that it play like the classics. Battles are won through rushes and spams. Though I said there were no dud units you dont really require a mixed force to win any battles. In fact nearly all my victories came down to getting my tech tree to the point where I could build Tri Walkers, Heavy Tanks or a large air force and just steam roll anyone in my way. Perhaps I've not gone up against the right enemy but I've required no real strategy or tactics to win. It just comes down to who can build a lot of a certain unit before the other.While the factions have distinct look they dont nearly have enough of a distinct feel. Apart from a few minor stat changes  units dont work all that different though I will say that Invaders tries to put a bit more effort with the Craninoids in this area (probably why I play them the most) but it would have been nice to have seen factions that truly play with very different styles. But then i guess it wouldnt have been a classic inspired game if it did that.Other criticisms include that each faction has a rather small roster of units, a bland story, no cutscenes to introduce or end each faction.Actually I'll backtrack on the story as there is a good idea here they just dont really delve into it.Theres this vaguely linked plot between each game where the commander (thats you of course) is being kicked around the multiverse forced to win victory after victory for each of the factions in the games. Granting world domination to the first faction your with only to utterly destroy them with the next. I find this idea quite interesting and would have loved to have seen more but sadly this 'meta' is only given a few lines in a couple of mission text boxes.If we do get a sequel to this and it becomes something more I would certainly want them to give us a proper story expanding upon what they've already seeded.I can certainly say I'm happy to recommend this game to those who love the rts golden years and to those who perhaps are a bit nervous at taking up this genre as it is so easy to pick up and at a reasonable price if you buy all three together.I hope that we see more of this series as I would like to see it evolve (perhaps into the next age of rts games such as Red Alert 2 and Emperor Battle for Dune).I hope you have found reading this useful and pick this series up.Have fun Commander."

Each faction has their own campagin which is, as with all 8-Bit, amazing fun and incredibly diverting!On the downside, the Metaverse game feels somewhat limited right now, but if Petrogyph are Petroglyph we can expect that to rapidly become something properly special.The only gameplay fault seems to be when multiplaying with cross game factions. The resource collection method that the Invaders use completely prevents Armies or Hordes from using resource points. This means that as resources become more scarce the usual queue of allied harvesters is replaced with one Invader player's resource collector, shutting everyone else out. With careful control and negotiation this needn't be a problem, but it is a bit hands on and can be frustrating for non-Invaders players.Update: As of the 20th of Dec Invader harvesters have been altered to avoid resource nodes close to allies."

He is the best commander I think possibly in the universe, but the side you join originally, you must betray by joining the opposite side, this game brings in a harvester that can stay at a node and not have to continually move back and forth, which is, I think revoulutionary, its pretty cool too anyways, so not only is the story I think fresh and new, there are easter eggs and little details hidden here, like in some maps, you might find randomly some penguins cooking up a nice chat, or at least what it looks like it, the developers are apparently obbsesed with penguins by the amount of penguins i have seen in this game, haha just kidding, no offense, anyways you can also find a phone booth sometimes, which reminds me of doctor who, anyways as i am typing this my wrists become sore and hurt, so i will try finishing this up quickly, so the story is pretty great along with some easter eggs here and there, their is also a muiltiplayer option which allow people who have bought hordes to play with people who have any ""8-bit"" game, and vice versa, really, I think its a great deal, also the developers love to hear feedback and will improve stuff if they think its neccasary i think, they do a good job helping new people at their discord channel which I think you can find easily, i myself dont really keep in touch anymore as i am quite busy with stuff, and im still kinda sick i think, anyways, i guess in a nutshell, get this game!.  Oh, and the music is pretty good too, i actually have the sound track from 8-bit hordes, won it from a tourtament, i dont wanna seem like im bragging lol. anyways ya.

And in my book that is some grind-y BS.The UI also needs some work. In particular the sound notifications that my units were under attack stopped playing, so I was directing my army half way across the map only to realize that half my base was gone because a single alien trooper was sitting there slowly shooting all my structures to bits.Not worth it, unfortunately."
,Not Recommended,531680,29369849,Posted: 19 January,all,CrateofmanymanyangryYoumu(s),"While the game is fun, the units are super weak individually. There is almost no balence because there are a few obviously best ways to play, and not much varience in how you can use units. The AI for your units is very basic and really needs even better basic pathing, and it will let units sit and attack from ranged and your units just sit there and kill them. I tried the campaign and it's borderline unplayable because of the unit AI. You have to micro def and attack and everything else manually because the AI cant handle it. The fact that tanks/walkers can instantly kill infantry makes them mostly useless, and the ground units that can attack air units trump all the other ground units because its not like any of the units are even that effective, except vs like one other unit. but you can't just use all the units because if you aren't microing your tanks, xenodogs can instantly kill your army when they die. Next is the AA turrets and the insane dmg they have (almost insta-kills and the invaders one has multi-targeting). This game has so many balence issues its not a good buy. I would keep on looking for a better RTS while this one *might* get fixed in balence. But while tanks kill everything while stutter steping, I dont see the point and the dlc/soundtrack isn't worth your money. If you want a more balenced and fair experience of buy forged alliance. And while yes, people don't like to compare the two, it's a much better RTS."

You only unlock necessary upgrades when you can do their stupid extra quests which are usually time based, or ""do/dont kill x"" based.The game is buggy - troops wont always move to attack something, or escape when being attacked - they just stand there like idiots being killed.  Pathfinding stuffs up sometimes.  You cant zoom out far enough to be effective either.  Sometimes ground troops wont unlock crates.Most maps so far have been set up in such a way that you have to use certain combinations of troops in the ""right"" way to win a map, rather than actually coming up with your own strategy.  View distance of flying vehicles is unnecessarily very poor too.  Enemies always get a head start on their bases and can throw stuff at you early, so you are forced to focus on defence before you can get to offence.Ive now finished the minimum required to complete the GM side (mostly easy, some on normal), and I really CBF'd doing the other side or finishing them all on higher difficulties.I am really on the fence about the thumbs up/down.
