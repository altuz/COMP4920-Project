76561198006413390,Recommended,531730,31808933,Posted: 17 May,all,woosk,"This second volume of the Corona Blossom series as a comedy with fanservice continue immediately from the ending of volume 1 where Keiji, Kumiko and Shino attempt to negotiate with Lily and Yunie and convince them to return R-ne home. This volume reveal more about Lily, Keiji and Shino's past as well as R-ne taking on the form of a catgirl.Reading through the entire kinetic visual novel will take less than 10 hours. Recommended when game is at bundle offer with the third and final volume 3as the game has a cliffhanger ending and the soundtrack DLC is only available at volume 3."

It got ruined by the extreme fan-service. The first volume was more into the story than fan-service. This was a complete fan-service volume.(at least from the first two chapters) I will try my best to not spoil anything. Few minutes into the game, you got some ""suprise"". Then, a few minutes later, another suprise. Then, a massive ""suprise"" that makes me think wtf am I doing with my life.Overall,If you are buying this game for the story, you kind of get some of it but not a whole lot.If you are a fan of the fan-service thingy, this is definitely better than the first volume.I will still recommend getting it for the awesome arts and the design.( I like the unique story so I will stay with it)7/10 compared to the first volumeMY OPINION~"

Its still a kinetic novel about a metal blob alien (who takes the form of a young cat girl) and space pirate cat girls but things progress.Your character is trying to help the ladies in his life while still being treated as a wage slave by his own grandfather, which in turn leads on to more mammary related jokes and events. Its so funny it will have you peeing on the floor (or at least watching someone peeing on you on the floor.. dont ask you will have to watch it to believe it)+FunnyCat girl space piratesBig baps-short"

,Recommended,531730,28259488,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,NurseWitch,"Just recently finished this and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this entry in the series! Even more so than volume 1. I initially bought Corona Blossom Vols. 1 and 2 mainly because I'm a big Frontwing fan and will buy whatever they put out. I honestly didn't expect much from Corona Blossom, but I was pleasantly surprised! Although the series is mainly a slice of life comedy, it also had quite a few instances where I felt touched and realized just how much I care about these characters, (Particularly the scene where R-Ne is desperately trying to buy grapefruit for Shino. As well as Shino’s backstory in general). I think the game does a great job at making you feel like you really are friends with the characters, making them important to you when more serious information is revealed about them.The characters are lively and the slapstick fanservice-y humor is very reminiscent of early 2000s anime (which is a plus for me!). The story can drag on a bit in a few places, but I kind of find that to be common in a lot of slice of life stories in general, so it's not something that ruined my experience.Overall, I find that Corona Blossom balances humor, fanservice, and story all pretty well, and definitely leaves you wanting more by the end of each volume!(My  first playthrough was around 5 hours, so I definitely think that the $10 price is worth it!)"

,Recommended,531730,29379356,Posted: 20 January,all,Hikkikomory,"I thought a lot of things before playing this game.I thought I wanted a daughter.After playing this game, I will never voluntarily have a child.I thought, being one who liked naked anime girls, that I was accepting of lolicons, because hey, people like what they like.After playing this game, all lolicons should end.The reasonings, you ask?R-Ne.R-Ne is the worst character ever created.Literally every other girl is best girl, and all the secondary characters and everything else is great.But I never want to see R-Ne's stupid flat chest or hear her stupid child voice ever again. Also, I'm pretty sure she jacks off dogs.But I know that I will, because I will buy and play volume 3. But I will be damned if it's not for finally getting introduced to Lala, who appears to be better than R-Ne in literally every single aspect.Anyway, buy these volumes. They're aesthetically beautiful, funny, and you get BIG♥♥♥♥♥♥"

There's more fanservice here but don't let that deter you. I mean, if you are seriously reading this VN for story, you're doing something wrong. The scenes in volume 2 are funnier than the previous volume.- A lot of the scenes are filler though just to hype you up to the next big reveal. Which is well done, I think. You get to know more about the characters.- The separate H patch will be a treat for those who want good sexy time with the pirate crews- Actually, you don't even need the patch. Just the content from the game itself will satisfy your thinking mind, your heart, and your groin. I know I did, especially at the groin.tldr; treat Corona Blossom as a fanservice game and think the story as a side extra and volume 2 can also work as an audiobook/ASMR for your pleasure and volume 3 WHEN"

It has better story then most Vn's as I said in the previous review, but it is also filled with fan service. so its is and overall good Vn, I would suggest buying this, but not unless you bought the first volume. Or else you wont understand anything that happens in this Volume."
