,Not Recommended,531740,29029428,Posted: 5 January,all,MakoSipper,"Rubek is one of those games that I'd give a neutral review if I had the option. It's nice concept and most puzzle are good enough, but my overall experience was sub-par.+ Very nice puzzle concept that relies on spatial orientation and on the ability to think of solids abstractly+ Most puzzles were smart and I enjoyed solving them+ Nice, relaxing visuals and sound effects+ Cheap game, with a good $/hour rate+ Has cards and achievements, if you're into them* Not an easy game, make sure you know what you're getting into- The lack of proper settings is a bit furstrating (like the absent in-game windowed mode option)- Puzzle difficulty doesn't go up smoothly. The game soon scales to pretty hard levels, then it gets easier again after level 60, only to get a lot harder after level 70- I would've prefered if most puzzles were more simple and elegant with solutions that would feel more like and ""eureka"" momento then making me feel that I got the answer by exhausting possible moves.- Controls are not good. You can use the arrow keys to move at least, but it feels clunky, especially until you figure out which way is up. Doesn't seem like an optimized port.- Terribly slow. Restaring a level takes about 10 seconds, which is really annoying if you're going for a bit of trial and error. Really annoying. Especially because of the next con...- Undo button doesn't work properly. At first, I thought there was a limit of moves you could undo, but that's not the case. Sometimes the button just won't work for some reason. Also, it's a bit broken, so you can cheat, if you undo a move and stop at a button/portal, it's like you didn't activate it.Again, it's not a bad game, but the concept could've been conveyed in a much nicer manner. If you happen to have it, maybe because you wanted the cards, I think it's at least worth trying. I would definitely get it on sale again, but I don't think I would buy it at full prince."

The levels are very well designed and I am already starting to feel the challenge at around level 20. With over 50 more levels to go, I can see myself coming back to this game over and over."

,Not Recommended,531740,32666457,Posted: 22 June,all,Terpal,"It's got a nice aesthetic and relaxing music. That's about the extent of the positives.This game is lacking the basics of game design. It almost appears as if the game developer has never played games themselves before or had nobody test it and give feedback. In the first 10 minutes of gameplay, enough ""game design sins"" occurred for me to quit.For example, restarting a level takes way too long. This is the kind of game that gives you stars based on how many moves you took each level. I don't like getting less than 3 because it feels like I didn't really complete the level, so I restart quiet often. Partially because (another game design error), the game doesn't tell you what e.g. buttons do. There are buttons on some levels that raise a tile of the map, but there's no indicator of which one it raises. So you have to just test it out and restart afterwards because, unlike before, now you can actually plan your moves because you know what to expect from the button. Anyway, the restarting takes too long. When you restart, there's an animation that takes away the level, then the screen fades into a ""Level x"" screen to, I guess, remind you which  level you're on? Then there's another animation that brings the level back, followed by an animation that puts your player on the level. This is way too much stuff for a simple restart mechanic and it's frustrating that you have to wait through it every single time you restart.Additionally, the game is lacking basic option menu features. There are no volume sliders, only a simple on/off for sound. I guess the developer expects the player to go into our OS volume mixer and adjust sounds there? There are also no fullscreen/windowed/borderless options at all, which is fairly annoying as this is a game I would be playing on one monitor while watching videos or something on my second monitor, which fullscreen doesn't lend itself to.Also, the controls aren't great. The game encourages dragging in the direction you want to move, but it can get pretty tedious. There are also arrow key support, but they're too confusing due to the perfect 45 degree angle the level has from the camera. Perhaps if it was more like 30 degrees and the arrows were better aligned with the camera angle it wouldn't be so unintuitive. Also, as far as I know, there are no restarting/undoing shortcuts with the keyboard, you  have to press the buttons in the bottom right of the screen. The developer, back in 2016, seems to have said that this would be added in a future update but I can't figure button it is. Of course, this wouldn't be a problem if the developer had decided to have a basic keybindings option in the menu, but they didn't so I have no idea if it's in the game or not. This is particularly annoying with the undo button as, as always, there's an animation associated with it. So if I want to quickly undo 10 moves, then tough luck, I have to wait for like 5 seconds for the game to complete the animation between each click. Also, quick note, the undo button is weird and annoying as well. It seems random as to how many moves you can undo. Sometimes it's just one and sometimes it's like 15. Of course there's no explanation at all of how it works.As far as the actual puzzles go, they're not great either. There's nothing to discourage you from simply mashing buttons until you get 3 stars (asides from the rage-inducing restart-mechanic, I guess), so a lot of the levels degenerate into random attempts.And these are just my impressions after the first chapter of the game. I suppose I'll keep playing it though just to use it as an example of what not to do when designing a video game."

76561197971813181,Recommended,531740,28941928,Posted: 2 January,all,Jon Bear,"A well designed game, however it is worth noting that the ""puzzle"" is figuring out how to solve the level in as few moves as possible. You will be able to ""solve"" any level in this game if you just keep rolling around which is kind of like smashing your face in a wall repeatedly to get past the wall. Then when you do pass the level you don't feel like you were smart, like other puzzle games, because you can't grasp what it is that you did right. Only way to grasp it, is to beat the levels in as few moves as possible.Trying to beat levels in few moves quickly became tedious to me. There are better minimalist puzzle games on steam."
,Recommended,531740,31183377,Posted: 16 April,all,pwnyou2295,"This is a great little puzzle game. The mechanics are simple, there is no time limit, and there are many levels. The goal is to solve the puzzles using the least moves possible. Doing so will award you up to 3 stars. There is a fair amount of replayability, as you can always go back and try to earn missed stars."

,Recommended,531740,33306112,Posted: 6 July,all,Quentin Vance,"I bought this game during the Summer Sales, expecting it to be nothing more than one of those puzzle games that start easily and become evil incarnate as you progress.Well, I was wrong. The game keeps going on (at least until chapter 4, which I'm playing as I write here) offering a good challange without ever being frustratingSo far I've only met two single bugs, one of the two being the switches not working immediately after undoing a move, and the other (more serious, actually) that caused the level to get stuck in the spawning animation after reloading (this one only happened once, I'll try to post a screenshot of it).Controls appear to be a little tricky using both joypad and keyboard, but I got used to them.So here are my ratings for Rubek:ProsRelaxing musicMinimalistic yet very nice graphicsNice variety of situationsLots of levelsDifficulty increases progressively, never being frustrating.Colorblind Mode (a little yet very important detail)ConsSometimes you can undo ten moves, sometimes just oneRestarting takes a little too longControls are a bit trickyOverall, I guess this game is well worth its 3€. If you're into puzzle games, you should get it."
,Not Recommended,531740,34828137,Posted: 8 September,all,jameslucas,"The puzzles seem like they would have been more fun to construct than to solve, and the development is underwhelming. Arrow keyscanbe used instead of the mouse for movement, but if there's a key-mapping for the (rather essential) undo action, it's neither programmable nor intuitive."

Has an interesting idea of matching up colors on your 'rubek' cube, while trying to pass colored path 'obstacles'. The mouse movement is a novel attempt at such a puzzle game, and is quite smooth. There are options to adjust the color scheme for people who might be color blind. Soundtrack is soft and non-intrusive. Great to see such games being available on steam!"
,Not Recommended,531740,27461630,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,Vyktar,This is the first minimalist puzzle game I've bought and the controls killed it for me. Isometic games that require you to learn that down is actually down left is really annoying and the mouse controls are awkward to use. Also I learned that I suck at solving puzzles.

Later levels can get pretty complex to figure out.  The undo function doesn't fully work, as you can only undo so many moves for some reason.  At least no time pressures to deal with."
,Recommended,531740,29835532,Posted: 10 February,all,Mr Ribbits,"It's an okay-to-good puzzler, which I think is mainly due to the concept and execution. It feels very restrictive with a lot of dead ends. Earlier puzzles don't teach the player very much since the right answer is usually the only possible path, so it's boring to start with, but it does get interesting later on. Controls add to the restrictive feeling; I guess I'm just used to tap-tap-tapping my way through puzzles to get where I want to go, and this one makes you wait. Visually it's very well-polished."

It's challenging enough, but the controls are often the biggest challenge for me. But while I can eventually get used to the controls, I'm more bothered that the game has no windowed mode. And the windowed mode you can force is incapable of being resized, meaning I can't actively play this game and watch someone stream at the same time.So no I don't recommend this game. But if the controls and lack of windowed mode don't bother you, then this is a pretty nice puzzle game to grab some of your time.P.S. And to further clarify why a lack of a windowed mode bothers me so much, my only screen is 20''. :/ The forced window mode takes up almost the same amount of space as before."

Its kinda like Rubiks Cube mechanic wise (I havent used one in ages & they were diffictult on hand).My only problem is that system's graphics are not accurate.

76561197971449965,Recommended,531740,26180115,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,Jenesis,"This is a lovely little puzzle game! The core mechanic of manipulating a cube's colours and facing immediately made me go 'ooh, that's clever', and after 30 levels the game is certainly delivering so far. There are 80 levels in total, so I'm a fair way through after only an hour, but I don't think the game's too short - I'm definitely slowing down as the difficulty increases, and even if there are only a few hours of gameplay here, for £1.99 I certainly don't feel shortchanged. [Update - I completed the game in about five and a half hours, so there's plenty here for the money.] The art style is lovely. If you're at all into puzzle games, this is worth a shot.There are a few things I'd like to see improved:- The controls. Mouse control - dragging in the direction you want the cube to roll - works most of the time, but I frequently find the cube overshooting or moving at 90 degrees to where I want it to go. Keyboard control is slightly awkward because the levels are at a 45-degree angle, and the arrow keys and WASD layout that are supported don't fit that pattern. Being able to use the number pad in a square formation (e.g. 1245 or 1379) would be more intuitive, I think.[EDIT: I've just noticed that there's controller support, which works much better, but not all PC/Mac users will have one.]- More than one music track would be nice. The music is simple, and sits in the background enough that the repetition isn't too bad, but some variety would be a plus.One final note - because the game was made with Unity Personal Edition, the game will be sending hardware statistics to Unity every time it's started. You'll need to decide whether that bothers you or not.Conclusion - if the devs can sort out the controls, this will go from being a great game to being an excellent game."

It has its good sides and flaws:PROS:The puzzle concept and levels design are goodNice aesthetics and polished UIGreat replayability if you want to finish all the levels within the minimum of movesCONS:Repetitive gameplay, there are only 2 new systems that appear along the 80 levels: switches and teleporters. Same background and tiles all along.Very depressive music track, with no possibility to mute only the musicThe game doesn't seem finished like it is right now. When completed, it says that new levels will come (but when?), also it lacks a full 100% achievement, and the colorblind mode provokes a major bug in some levels (I reported it, but I didn't get any answer from the devs).So I recommend this game when on sale like it is right now, and if you're really into puzzles."
