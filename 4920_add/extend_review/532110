76561198220519669,Recommended,532110,32307743,Posted: 9 June,all,EndarkCuli,"""Rusty Lake: Roots"" is an entertaining (and cheap!) collection of ""locked room"" style puzzles that involves not only looking for objects, but also figuring out puzzles and the occasional math equation. The game's imagery (actually, the Rusty Lake series as a whole) might seem a tad weird and convoluted, but in more of an entertaining ""Twin Peaks-esque"" way than ""this is going to give me nightmares"". Aside from looks, the only other thing that I think might turn people away from this game is the length; it'll vary depending on one's problem-solving skills, of course, but expect it to be short, with the only 'replayability' once you solve the final puzzle being the new (as of this Review's posting) Achievements. With that said, personally, I thought the experience lasted just as long as it needed to in order to make a good impression on me. I enjoyed this game's atmosphere, and its ability to present a twisted story without heaps of dialogue.  And in the end, not only do I recommend others giving this a try, I also hope that this won't be the last we see of Rusty Lake."

Stylish, puzzling, and creepy, just like all other 'Cube escape' games you can play for free. Only this one is much, much longer (and it is about two times bigger than 'Rusty Lake Hotel'), but still rather very cheap.The only drawback is that the authors cannot put the achievements into Flash engine for some reason.Still, can't recommend it high enough!"

A studio that aims serve their customers well (they fixed a bug within 4 hours after publishing), that offers their games for a very reasonable price, and a studio that obviously loves their creations.I am absolutey amazed by their creative and hard work and I am looking forward to the next adventure!If you like Roots, there's another game on Steam called ""Rusty Lake Hotel"".

However, if you like ""room escape"" type games, this is a very good one. The puzzles are clear (you may not know WHY you're doing something, but WHAT you have to do is easy to decipher) and varied, ranging from moving sliders and pushing buttons to some simple logic problems; the game overall is on the ""easy"" side. However, I think the main puzzle the game is really  putting together the pieces of the story, and that's where the game shines: its eerie atmosphere, macabre humour, and interesting (and non-explicit) narrative that had me finish it all in one sitting. I think this game is an improvement over Rusty Lake Hotel (which also has its positivies), and I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this dev in the future!"

,Recommended,532110,32603636,Posted: 20 June,all,Beesmarck,"NOTE: I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PLAYING THE DEVELOPER'S CUBE ESCAPE SERIES BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME. THEY ARE GREAT ALTHOUGH A LITTLE LESS POLISHED DEMONSTRATIONS OF WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS GAME. YOU CAN FIND THEM FOR FREE AT THE DEVELOPER'S WEBSITE OR APP STORE OF YOUR CHOICE.Rusty Lake: Rootsis a point-and-click adventure that is equal parts thrilling and intriquing with a healthy doze of dark humour. It follows the story of the Vanderboom family over generations in a plot that feels mystical, maybe even confusing at first, but rewards you whole heartedly for making sense of it.The gameplay is what it is. There is not much to praise or criticize as is usual with games that rely very little on mechanics. It's worth noting however that the game was clearly designed with touch screens in mind. The circles that form around your mouse with every click and the way some of the objects in the world are interracted with may be a bit jarring at times, but nothing that would take away from the experience. One thing that I found surprisingly pleasing however was the complete absence of in-inventory item mixing. This may sound like an unnecessary simplification, but in practice it makes a noticeable chunck of the puzzles much smoother experiences as you always have the things that need to be interracted with right in front of you.With that, almost ironically, given the game's themes, clarity is where the game shines. The infuriating moments where you don't know where or what to do are few and far between. While the artstyle isn't anything spectacular from a purely aesthetic view, it works wonders in telling you what is happening, what to do and what you can work with. A respectable feat once you realize just how bizzare and surreal the scenes and puzzles can get.The real reason to play this game, and the thriving force that keeps you hooked, is the narrative.The world of Rusty Lake is a fantastic example of the kind of storytelling that only video games can pull off and still make for a thoroughly compelling story. In the world of Rusty Lake the past is never dead, it's not even the past and we are always here in our past and future lives. Time is not a matter of concern and neither is the order in which you play the games, as they all work to answer questions from other games in the series and asks new ones for the rest to unravel. In this way, the family tree of Rusty Lake: Roots is almost like a microcosm of the series as a whole, with it's splitting branches that all come together in the end to form a story without ever having to do as much but wink at the player from time to time."

76561198084874653,Recommended,532110,30067787,Posted: 20 February,all,Phoenix Hinotori,"""Rusty Lake: Roots"" is a delightfully twisted addition to the Cube Escape/Rusty Lake series.  Featuring a variety of puzzles of a range of difficulties (including a set of puzzles to solve after the initial game is completed), this game follows the lives of the Vanderboom family, through courtships, births, rivalries, and death.  Incredibly creepy and not for the extremely squeamish.  (I will never look at voodoo dolls the same way again... ditto for ""test tube babies."")If you're already a fan of the series, you'll appreciate the various nods to previous installments; if you've never played any of the games in the series, you won't miss out on much (and may even be interested in trying out the free previous installments).

,Recommended,532110,35449449,Posted: 3 October,all,Audish,"I wasn’t expecting a whole lot after Rusty Lake Hotel. As interesting as the premise and setting were, the strange little puzzle box rooms of irritating brain-teasers didn’t give me much hope. That made it all the more surprising when Rusty Lake: Roots appeared to take all the lessons I had hoped they would from the prior game. It’s not a perfect genesis of the series, but the improvement is so dramatic I think it makes Rusty Lake Hotel a stronger recommendation by association.The year is 1860 and James Vanderboom has just inherited a house from his late uncle. Arriving in the spring, he finds a seed and a note with instructions to plant and tend to it as he looks after the estate. From this humble beginning blooms the tale of the cursed Vanderboom family, tracing the lives of three generations of unfortunate souls. As their lives take their tragic turns, the story weaves everything back to that original seed and their unifying curse, and ultimately one of the dark secrets of Rusty Lake.Much like the previous game, Roots is heavily steeped in the macabre. None of the people whom you guide through these stories will meet kind ends, and many will suffer significant agonies before their lives are allowed to end. It’s not as gory or gormless as its precursor though, and does a much better job of living up to the macabre label. Most of the horror here comes from witnessing the inevitable, from seeing a scene build to an obvious tragedy and being powerless to stop it. Some of the best plotlines here involve lost children or love triangles that give the sinister events a more grounded base.The drama unfolds in short vignettes, arranged chronologically along the lifelines of the players in question. These vignettes are single scrollable scenes which contain a handful of puzzles to solve in the course of reaching a generally obvious result. It might be as charming as getting a gentleman to propose to a lady, as painful as sending a young man off to war, or as nefarious as dropping a young boy down a well. Scenes should take about 10-15 minutes to complete, during which you’ll uncover more clues to the overarching mystery and perhaps a few hints as to the nature of Rusty Lake itself.The big improvement here for me is the quality of the puzzles, which are all far more sensical and thematically consistent than those in Hotel. Having single scenes focused around a central puzzle or puzzles helps limit potential flailing and allows each puzzle to do more in service to the story. I only found myself stumped in a few places, and this time I didn’t feel like it was because the puzzles were badly designed. Everything had a purpose and a logic to it, and that gave the game a more cohesive feel overall.The only aspect I found weaker this time was the ending, unfortunately enough. By the third generation of characters it should be clear what the ultimate goal of the game is, and when you reach the end it just kinda happens and then fades to black. There’s no real revelation aside from the immediate result of your actions, and it falls a lot flatter than the insane reveals at the end of Hotel. I did play through the New Game+ style continuation to see the secret ending and while I liked that one more, it still didn’t do much to satisfy my curiosities.While there are obviously links between Rusty Lake Hotel and Roots, they’re minor enough that you wouldn’t miss much by skipping Hotel. It’s unfortunate the story doesn’t take more advantage of the otherworldly weirdness of its predecessor but Roots is a strong enough game to stand on its own and command your attention for a few hours. The disturbing scenes and thematic puzzles do an excellent job of gripping the player as they uncover the secrets of this sad family, and only fail to completely pay off at the very end. As long as you’re not expecting something mind-blowing in the conclusion, though, this one definitely succeeds where Rusty Lake Hotel stumbled.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"

The game is at times disturbing and there were a few occasions I had to 'nope' out but it was well worth it.Rusty Lake Roots is certainly a step up from the original Rusty Lake Hotel (both of which are worth a playthrough). You solve puzzles to make your way through a family tree and come across a disturbing story. The puzzles are at times a decent challenge and there is even a great completion reward (similar to a true story ending) for those of you like to 100% complete games like myself. I quite like the asthetics of the game and can see a lot of love and effort went into the game."
,Recommended,532110,26483254,"Posted: 7 November, 2016",all,nerdfury,"I thought the puzzle solving was excellent in Rusty Lake: Hotel and I was excited about playing the second Steam release, Rusty Lake: Roots, which chronicles the lives of the Vanderbloom family over 3 generations. I had a feeling Rusty Lake: Roots would offer more in terms of gameplay length, but I didn’t think I would be blown away in terms of storytelling and characterization. I was completely wrong.While Rusty Lake: Hotel was a strong puzzle game, the characters I encountered were rather lacking in personality for the most part. I didn’t feel for them at all and just moved from one puzzle to the next. Rusty Lake: Roots is a completely different game in this regard. Not only are there are more high-quality puzzles (you can expect 5+ hours of gameplay without using a walkthrough), I felt an emotional connection to some characters as horrible, bizarre stuff happened to them. I had a strong desire to progress the story, not only for the delightful variety of puzzles, but also to see what happened to the characters who over time demonstrated personalities (despite there being barely dialogue). Unlike the first game, the Vanderbloom family members are not props in a scene that experience ghastly deaths with little empathy from the player. I had an emotional investment in the storyline, and that’s a sign of an excellent point and click adventure game (or any video game, rather).I’m so happy I played Rusty Lake: Roots and it’s become one of my favorite point and click adventure games (and I play a LOT of games in this genre). Beyond the solid storytelling and puzzles, which I’ve ranted enough about, I also thoroughly enjoyed the artwork, music soundtrack, and the ability to solve puzzle rooms in a non-linear fashion (given the multiple branches in the Vanderbloom family tree). EVERYTHING is top-notch, and I will remember the Vanderbloom family for years to come.Especially Albert."
,Recommended,532110,31233857,Posted: 19 April,all,darksiren,"Completed this nifty little puzzle game just now and wanted to write up a positive review.This is my first Rusty Lake / Cube Escape game. I found it through my Discovery Queue. I found the overarching story and characters (including the cameos from other games) intriguing enough that I want to play more in the series. The mood and setting is spot-on eerie Victorian with touches of occult, just enough to make you uneasy but not completely revolted while playing.I found the choice to rely on pictographs, colors and other visual cues over text or dialogue to figure out puzzles a welcome challenge, for the most part. A few times, especially in the later puzzles, it was frustrating enough to figure out what to do next that I went to the Rusty Lake website to look up video tutorials. It's nice the developers make these available (but only look when you're well and truly stuck--otherwise you're ruining the experience for yourself!)There were several classic puzzles 'reskinned' for the story and theme of the game, and I could also see the 'Escape Room' influence (the first game Rusty Lake made, Cube Escape & its derivatives, is an escape-style game). I've played some Escape Rooms with groups in real life, so I'm curious to see how Cube Escape holds up to that experience.One last thing, the resolution is kinda small, more suited to tablet than desktop. That didn't bother me, though. I could still easily see and manipulate all parts of the screen.All in all, even with the small frustrations, I found this game to be well worth its $2.99 price.

Here we see the Vanderboom Family Tree and can watch how it grows.  It starts out quite small but is very large before the end.  You will see pieces of the family's lives and if you have played Cube Escape you will recognize many faces.First is James.  He isn't the oldest and certainly not the first you may have met but as he moves in to the house so too are you eased in to the game.  Just like the Hotel there is a dream-like quality to each of their lives.  A horrific logic that makes terrible things seem completely sensible.  There will be blood and things may be difficult but there is no reason to fear.  Whether you know or not the full events of Cube Escape you will find more than you bargined for here with a memorable experience.  The past is not the past here.  The family secrets can be hard to spot at times but a little effort will take you to their roots.If you played Rusty Lake Hotel then you know what to do."

Not giving any spoilers. The little snippets of voice acting aren't the best, but the Twin Peaks-esque story itself definitely makes up for it in my opinion, making it more than worth the price, grasping your attention as you play through with an addictive mix of well-paced macabre and surreal schizophrenic experiences."

,Not Recommended,532110,33513218,Posted: 13 July,all,Minty,"I paid a little under $5 for the bundle which included both Rusty Lake games. I regret buying and playing both of them.This game in particular has the superior story, is longer, and... more puzzles. I don't say better or worse puzzles because while it does have some more challenging ones (in a good way) than Hotel did, it also has some that are harder (in a bad way) than Hotel.There are intriguing puzzles that caused me to really think and learn throughout the game, but there were also janky kinds of jigsaw-puzzle areas that wouldn't function properly when you tried to ""snap"" the pieces in place, making it all the more furstrating trying to even solve them. There were also of course, the same kinds of puzzles that were in Hotel where you figure out the solutions either by accident, clicking things randomly and using your items on every possible item until something happens. It's a very mixed bag of super creative puzzles and god-forsakenly awful puzzles that make you want to look up guides sooner than ask for hints.What about the story? I purchased the bundle initially because I really thought the story was interesting. And throughout, it really is. It's gorey, creepy, with minimal jump-scares, and throughout the whole thing you can feel how it's only going to get worse for the characters. But by the end...? It's kind of a let down. Some have said ""It's referencing the Cube Escape games!"" but I personally believe any and all spin-off stories should still be able to hold their own in their self-contained worlds. This game sort of did, but it doesn't explain motivations of most of the characters, and leaves you with a very redundant, poorly executed conclusion of: (SPOILERS BELOW)It's all some kind of reincarnation time loop! Not very interesting, not very appealing, and because the game doesn't explain how time is repeating this way, or why, it's just kind of. Blah. We don't even get to really know the character that is the cause of this time loop, either. Or how the supposed master-mind is pulling it off/why. It's not satisfying at all.I believe anything with effort put into it is worth some amount of money, but I do wish I had not bought these games. You can get the exact same experience just watching someone play it live, and so unless you can get it for 1 dollar, I'd say take a pass. Even if you love puzzles, the horrible excuses for puzzles, and broken controls for a good amount of them, aren't worth the head-ache. And the longer the game goes on, the more non-sensical the ""puzzles"" get."

Although Rusty Lake: Roots referenced Rusty Lake Hotel, I should have played Rusty Lake: Roots first because it waswonderful. The puzzle design was much better and the various scenes were more linear, in a good way - unlike in Rusty Lake Hotel, you didn't find yourself having to replay a scene (or the whole game) because you hadn't done things exactly right.I originally only intended to play this for a little bit and then go to bed, but the characters and story completely grabbed me. Unlike Rusty Lake Hotel, I actually found Rusty Lake: Roots to be a bit creepy, and the incredibly messed up relationships and Vanderboom family history had me hooked. It also didn't hurt that most of the puzzles were relatively easy to figure out and the harder ones usually weren't so hard that my frustration outweighed my enjoyment.My biggest complaint is that the sliding controls were occasionally glitchy for me. However, it helped that the game still included buttons I could click to slide left or right within a particular scene."

Where the original game was amusing and twisted, this game presents a series of tedious puzzles, most too simple to be interesting and many disgusting beyond good taste.

[And for the love of all logic... why is the aunt okay with giving her nephew a mug of dog urine instead of water, but insists on cooking the fish before giving it to him?

Suffice to say that the family's story is dark and twisted, but fails to be entertaining.  A few of the puzzles were interesting, but the majority were too simple to be interesting.

The difficulty of the puzzles is moderate, and none of them will get you stuck too long, as far as you carefully observe and consider the scene and clues given to you.

It was,  well upsetting to see they had changed from what was apperently travelling through and changing memories(an great concept) to what seemed to be boring, tired old time travel.And the cubes, so far Rusty Lake has done a great job in building up a feeling of foreboding and horror whenever you see one of the cubes, I mean extracting memories to make these cubes and why?Also it didn't continue with the story of Dale Vandermeer(which for those of you who don't know means Dale of the lake(Illuminati confirmed)) though the Vanderboom's(of the tree) might be somehow related...BUT Rusty Lake is a great game and I reccomend it"

Although, it is the longest game from Rusty (I think), the bgm keep the game intense for me. Lately, I've seen the review with the save/load issues, I'm not complaining about that since I always finsh the game within 1 play, but I think that's a bit annoying for a premium games. I wish Rusty could fix that, somehow, and thanks for the game."

The puzzles are consistently tricky no matter how many times a replay it and I love the piece-it-together-yourself storytelling throughout the games.  Each game is better than the last making Roots the best one yet!  I'm a little sad that they started charging for their games but given the size and quality, I'm not at all surprised and would gladly pay any amount for a new game.  I'm excited to see where they'll take the series from here."

However, I personally found some puzzles too counterintuative, the one with the frog, beetle and cricket I needed a walkthrough for, along with how to do the whole final scene. If you liked the original and can stand a very long game by point-and-click standards, I would highly recommend it nonetheless."

,Recommended,532110,34296582,Posted: 16 August,all,G.,"This is a very dark and unique game. It offers you a view into a couple generations of a single family and with each level you complete, you see how intricately tied together all the characters are (they definitely got some issues).If you enjoy puzzles and some morbidity, then this game is definitely for you and depending on how quick you solve the puzzles, there's a good amount of content (I personally took a good 4 hours or so). In the event that you get stuck, there's a complete walkthrough available.I definitely enjoyed this game :)"
,Recommended,532110,34444306,Posted: 23 August,all,craquelins,"Expected nothing less from the amazing creators at Rusty Lake. Game mechanics are really simple and puzzles are challenging but not unbearable like in some games. I've experienced some kind of a bug when I collect items sometimes they appear in inventory twice not once but it didn't ruin a game for me. I also don't mind restarting the game for achievements or so but it can be a little frustrating if you don't want to solve the same puzzles again. I enjoyed this so much , I really didn't care how many times I played it. I love the story of Rusty Lake and how it is presented."
