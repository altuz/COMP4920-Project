76561198061128125,Recommended,532170,31265559,Posted: 20 April,all,Chenault,"TL;DR WaveLand is lovely, challenging, and a successful loveletter to Melee movementBelow is a somewhat wordy review:Concept: I have a deep love of Super Smash Brothers Melee, and Logan Foster brings the unique spacing manuever ""Wavedashing"" into a world of platforming. After experiencing Melee movement and microspacing I found myself desiring these options in other games as well, so I had high hopes and bought WaveLand on release.Gameplay: Within minutes I approved of the game's physics and movement. Mr. Foster tuned his level design splendidly with the beast he had constructed. The input buffering and hitboxes all feel precise. The potential for optimization and speed in WaveLand is massive and addicting. Several times I could not make myself leave  a level until I was #1 on the leaderboard. After introducing the concept, no time is wasted in ramping up the difficulty, and similar to Melee, WaveLand might be treacherous for the casual gamer. Those hungering for a challenge will have their appetite sated. In game currency is entirely for aesthetic customization, but obtaining coins and solving hubworld puzzles is fun and satisfying in its own right.Story: Messages are scattered  throughout the world alluding to the overarching plot of the game. The story is sparse and slightly cryptic, and is certainly not the focus of WaveLand.Visuals: I'd lay money that WaveLand was created in Gamemaker, which typically means the visual quality is largely tied to the skill of the pixel artist/animator. In WaveLand's case, everything looks clean and clear. There was not a single time that my eyes were confused about any part of the game. Everything is immediately recognizable which allows a player to react and maintain speed even in the first time through the area. Environmental art keeps things fresh and imaginative between worlds while remaining unobtrusive.Sound: All sound effects are distinguishable and appropriate. WaveLand's soundtrack is mixed nicely with the feel of the game. It functions mainly as slighty hype background music, but there are some inquisitive and atmospheric touches in the hubworlds.Closing comments: WaveLand is fully aware of itself. Most game elements function as above average placeholders and take a backseat to the core mechanics. This game is about speed, efficiency, and near frame perfect inputs a la Dustforce. While the roots are strongly in Melee, the mechanics come into their own with a few intelligent tweaks.  I must praise Mr. Foster specifically for his level design, difficulty curve, and overall awareness. The later levels fully respect and employ the difficulty that is called for when you make wavedashing your core mechanic. We should all keep our eyes out for his upcoming projects in the future! Congratulations to Logan Foster on a well-made game. Your love for Melee movement is shared by many, and is palpable in Waveland."

I would recomend making sure you have a controller (an Xboxone controller works good for me), because controlling the game on keyboard isn't great, but other than that this game plays amazingly."

,Recommended,532170,32281082,Posted: 8 June,all,Hardboned™,"WaveLand is a game based on Super Smash Bros. Melee's game exploit known as wavedashing. In this game, you wavedash,the act of dodging towards the ground and then gaining momentum from it. It is your main method of movement. In this game, you will also come across wall jumping as an ability and a shine-stall, which lets you stall in the air and reflect projectiles. The game can prove to be very challenging and have extremely tight situations. My biggest gripe with the game is how it handles time. If you fail to beat a level in a certain amount of time, you will be unable to progress to the Nightmare levels which are required to beat the game. This does make it quite annoying to progress but overall, it can be done eventually.Overall, the game is good and I'd recommend to people who enjoy quick but difficult games like Super Meat Boy.8/10; Great."
,Recommended,532170,31268556,Posted: 20 April,all,Hexie Lambent,"Plain and simple, this is a joy to play for those interested in speedruns, going fast, and agile acrobatics.  The versatility and possibilities in the movement is darn near perfection.  Other than that, what you see is what you get - clean and clear visuals with a signature flair alongside a powerful OST.  The level design is fun and unique, with the hub world just as nice as each level included in it, and the atmosphere, while very cryptic, is interesting and inviting.Even with the abundance of references to Melee both from players and the game itself, I actually felt it played a lot like a spiritual successor to Dustforce, another speedrunning platformer which is amazing, obviously with a few key differences.  I've played my own large share of many Smash Bros. games, but I was never interested in the intricacies of high level movement.  Given all of the time spent in those games and a large number of other platformers, speedrun-ny or otherwise, this game still feels like it has a life all its own, even when it flaunts its inspiration.Built from love, loads of fun, and a bargain price tag.  Instant recommendation if you have any interest in it."

76561198309376768,Recommended,532170,32094664,Posted: 31 May,all,Dolan(random numbers here),"This is a really solid game. Using the movement mechanics from Super Smash Bros. Melee (AN INSTANT CLASSIC WITH THYE BEST EVERYTHING), you play as a small white box, trying to find himself. This game is really fast-paced and is really fun to speedrun. I'm supprised this isn't more popular."

The only gripe I had with the game was the lack angles made it sometime wavedash in place, but this is quicly fixed by unlocking all the angles in the gameplay options."

,Not Recommended,532170,31386277,Posted: 26 April,all,jerkin with other dudes,"I thought I would like it based on the demo, but it's not as fun as I remember.  If you do buy this game, play it with a controller, (specifically a gamecube controller) otherwise it would be actual hell."
,Not Recommended,532170,31258222,Posted: 20 April,all,Blib blab,"okay right, the controls are the wierdest places on keyboard to begin with and also the game only registers down inputs once so if you try to hold down it never works, good design but TERRIBLE CONTROLS. AND I AM NOT BUYING A CONTROLLER FOR ONE GAME. if you make keyboard a handicap then don't allow keyboard or put a warning, please."

,Recommended,532170,33846167,Posted: 27 July,all,Steggun,Love the movement system. Bought this because of a post on the Dustforce subreddit.
,Recommended,532170,33798641,Posted: 25 July,all,Quotation-Dono,So I remember liking the demo of this game.... and well now I know whyThe demo spoiled me and othersThe Good-Controls are solid if you play on keyboard or d-pad (I have an 8bitdo controller and plays fantastically on that)'-The asthetic is simplistic in a very stylish manner-The music is really good-Fast falling is actual fast falling now (tapping down at the height of your jump arch)The Bad-If you played the demo than have fun ripping your hair out with the extremely restrictive 8 way dash to find out that the non-garbage wavedash needs to be unlocked (honestly a bad design choice considering that Gamecube controllers play best here so good luck with unlearning your smash wavedash techs for a good portion of the game)All around solid game for speed runners and platformer junkies. 7/10
