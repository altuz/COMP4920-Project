76561198012199327,Recommended,532190,34398987,Posted: 21 August,all,JPS,"This is my first review for a game on Steam. Super Blood Hockey drew it out of me. It's such a fun game, plays well & has lovely retro pixel graphics. It has only international teams.I find it quite a challenging game, which is great. I'm still yet to win a game, haha. Although it does have five difficulty levels, easy to pro. Scoring takes some practice because the goalies are good but I'm starting to score some crackers. I don't even mind losing, the games have been so competitive. I lost my last match 8-7, best game yet.It has an exhibition mode: a one off friendly... If you can call it that.A tournament mode: You compete against 7 other teams in a round robin.Lastly a challenge mode: it pits you against a team in, at time of writing, 5 differing scenarios, one of which is Outnumbered... You have 4 team members, the opposition has 8, really fun. Or Mega Rumble... A 12 v 12 match up.This is a no rules ice hockey game. Hit the opponents as much as required & I suggest you do so often... Even the referee.Sometimes a fight will break out, just try beating four extra opposition players. Great game.Update: Starting to win now, at least on medium difficulty. Even won a couple of tournaments."

Pass - shoot - score.It is the video game equivalent of air hockey or bubble hockey, and it is just as fun as both.The only negative I have is that there is no online play. Whether that gets added or not at some point, I really don't care.This game is an easy ""Yes, I recommend this game!"", I HIGHLY recommend this game. It is ridiculously cheap, and it is ridiculously fun.The dev (1 guy!) is active on the Steam forums for the game, and is taking suggestions and doing bug fixes as they are reported.Absolutely top notch dev, and yes, please - support this guy. Buy this game."

The option to only control one character with the AI controlling the others is really nice too, and there are plenty of hillarious moments such as when the ref regularly gets beat up or the zamboni runs over players as they leave the rink.  Bottom line: if you enjoyed Ice Hockey, DEFINITELY get this, and if you haven't played that but like arcade sports games, also get this."

,Recommended,532190,34387964,Posted: 20 August,all,Buff Orpington,"Super Blood Hockey is basically an M-rated version of an imaginary 16-bit sequel to Ice Hockey on the NES. SBH improves on Ice Hockey in many ways: battles for the puck and line brawls aren't reduced to button-mash fests as they were on the NES, nor are the CPU goalies easily juked, and the skinny guys aren't completely useless against human opponents like they were back in the mid-80s.  Here it's the fat guys that are the liability, since they have no speed AND they don't dominate everyone except other fatties in puck battles like they did on the NES. The added challenge and tournament modes add replayability the NES didn't have as well. There's a gigantic dose of humor and pixel-blood in the game. Instead of going to the penalty box, a player from the losing side lies seizing on the ice for 30 seconds, spurting blood all over the place. The zamboni will run down players leaving the ice if they don't exit quickly enough. Lots of neat touches like this are sprinkled all over the game and makes it fun to pick up and play. The only place SBH doesn't improve over Ice Hockey is the music, which is pretty great, but not timeless and steeped in nostalgia like the NES version... you can't really fault them for that though."

Pure and simple hockey with plenty of gore and grungy chiptunes.A couple of suggestions for future devlopment (pretty please!):- Burst speed skating. With everyone skating at the same speed it's impossible to defend against breakaways.- Need to be able to control only the goalie, so you can defend while the AI controls the other 4 guys on your team.- Choose your team's AI offense/defense strategies at the beginning of each period. Crash the net vs. umbrella, box defense vs. man to man, etc."

Momentum feels good, though a ""dash"" button wouldn't go amiss, the art style is great, and a decent amount of detail hidden on screen.There is a very dark charm to the game, from the reactions of the players when they get checked, to the Zamboni driver who... let us just say... is so focused on his job that he doesn't seem to notice anything, or anyone, in his way! The pixel violence can be lowered or shut off totally, if that isn't your thing, or upped to stupid levels if Jason Voorhees comes round to play.One niggle I have, is the choice of teams. It is.. interesting... to be mild about it, and could do with either expanding into other international teams, or changed into real/fictional club teams. I feel a USA versus North Korea match may lead to some issues!Super Blood Hockey is the NBA Jam or Blitz the League of Ice Hockey, and all in all a great throwback to 16 bit era gaming. Great fun, and well worth a buy for Hockey fans."

,Recommended,532190,34882076,Posted: 11 September,all,n00ban ganley,"Check out my impressions here.This game reminded me of the good old days of hockey games, by which I mean THE FIGHTS! I remember playing hockey games on the Sega Mega-Drive, and most of the fun to be had in those games was derived from trying to start a fight in the game. It was a novelty, but a lot of fun. So much fun, in fact, that there was a Monster Hockey League game that tried to amp up the violence a bit. Super Blood Hockey is a fun tribute to those old hockey games, with a dash of extra violence. No need to wait around for a fight, they happen quite a lot. Even the ref can get knocked over in the mayhem! My only gripe with the game is that the speed of the characters feels sluggish, and almost tank-like in their turning for some. Luckily, you can unlock a feature to adjust the characters weight, essentially giving them all a speed boost. I feel like it should be faster off the bat, but still, this is a great nod to those old hockey games, and has a fantastic, frantic arcade feel to it. Highly recommended, especially with friends!"

Especially your team, they will do their best to lose the game for you. Constantly cut you off in breakaways.

I have to first hand that the review was entirely false. This game is great. If you grew up in the 90's playing the NHL series on Sega Genesis then you will absolutely love this game. There are several game modes to choose from, as well as challenges. The challenges range in difficulty and unlock a number of features in the game giving you a goal to keep you coming back to play some more. I started off on an easy difficulty, and by my 2-3rd hour in I was able to play on Pro difficulty. I think I will find myself coming back to play this game over and over again."

But a cheaper option might be to just flip a coin and guess which side it will land on. The difficulty curve and entertainment value will be about the same... and you'll probably lose interest just as fast.This game is basically still in early access, as it feels like its just missing a bunch of features. Two hours in, I'm done here. In its current state, this game is worth $2.99 USD. Its a nostalgia trip, but thats where it gets off. Its hardly funny, and after the initial ""aw isnt that adorable"" factor. The blood is kinda whatever, the hits are whatever. There were even moments where the puck would get stuck in the boards, or stuck under the goalie. Luckily the players resolve this moment by just fighting. Everything is pretty much pre-canned, all of the teams feel the exact same (spoiler alert, they are)... computer doesnt even randomly select between the 3 player types, always playing against the same loadout. During a game, there is no random chance for a player to get injured. The AI is kinda weak and very unpredictable, controls are drifty when I go to ""aim my shot"" or ""toggle select a specific defender"", and playing with a mouse and keyboard is practically impossible.I don't know what I expected, but after 2 hours, I'm actually pretty aggravated with playing this game. I get upset when I cant toggle my defensive character to the person I want to switch to. I get upset when the sniper class seems relatively useless when I need them the most. I get angry when the goalie saves every shot possible, but the only goals that get let in are just spam shots and garbage scramble plays right in front of the net. Fighting happens far too often, some games I'll get like 10 line brawls and honestly after the first 2 or 3 or so, it gets a bit old.I guess I was hoping more for like a mutant league type of game.... but this is not that. This is a throwback and thats it. After 2 hours, I genuinely feel like I want a refund because I cant imagine playing it anymore than this, but at my purchase price of $5.99 usd, I feel like someone just kinda stole taco money from me. I just wish this game had more depth, or it was funnier, or more grotesque, give it something more."

Game totally captures the nostalgia of NES Ice Hockey with a new twist of over the top violence and tournament play.  If you liked NES Ice Hockey spend the 6 bucks for this game and relive your past.  I can't reccomend it more.To those giving negative reviews because ""even on easy the AI is too hard,"" seriously get a grip.  This game is nothing compared to the difficulty of original console sports games.  Go ahead, load up NES Ice Hockey, good luck, you can't do one timers.  Then come back here and tell me how hard this game is.  I have 1.5 hours in as of the writing of this review.  I have lost 1 game in an 8v4 challenge game.  Final score 8-6.  Meanwhile I won my first regular game in OT and then proceeded to win a tournament as North Korea.  I had two shutouts in the 3 games played.  So I guess either the AI is not that good or I am the greatest player ever in this game that I just picked up an hour and a half ago.NORTH KOREA WINS!Anyways back to the actual review.Pros:Tight game playFast Paced ActionLots of Blood if you want itControl over the brawlsQuick tournaments for a few laughsCaptures the nostalgia of the NES classicGreat MusicChallenges add variety and difficultyCons:Blood sometime makes it tough to see what's going on (Probably intentional, and I have it set as high as possible so it could be my fault)Fat/Medium/Skinny players all seem to have the same ability in checking and in fighting (not a big deal but took a bit to get used to)Limited team selection like the original (would like to see more added perhaps in the future just for the laughs)Some of the game options are tied to completing challenges (not my favorite thing in the world to have to complete tasks in order to experience the full game)Overall a great game.

,Recommended,532190,34316011,Posted: 17 August,all,iNeedScissors67,"So far it's a great throwback to classic SNES hockey with some ultra-violence thrown in. Turn up the blood if you want it to look like Tarentino-on-ice.The gameplay is about what you'd expect, althought the skating feels a bit slow and floaty to me. It does play well. and I like that the control scheme is kept basic (shoot button, check button, pass button, switch players). The art is nice and the music is fantastic. The fights, which are basically team-wide 4v4 brawls, are great, and they do have some impact on the game. If your team loses the fight, one of your players will be down on the ice, hemmorrhaging blood for a couple of minutes, essentially acting as a power play, except one that doesn't end when a goal is scored.The shooting/scoring itself almost feels like playing air hockey. So far most of my goals have been scoring by just relentlessly pressing the shoot button, and you can and should definitely use the posts to your advantage. Bonus points for being able to take out the ref, too.A few suggestions that I have would be something like an on-fire system like in NHL Hitz 2002, and a sprint/boost button or something like that. The uniforms look fine but in some matches I have a hard time telling apart the team jerseys in the midst of all the action.All in all this is an incredibly fun hockey game, and the price makes it a must-buy for anyone looking for this kind of game. Grab a beer and enjoy...this game is what Old Time Hockey could have and should have been."

You can run circles around the AI and outplay them even on PRO level (highest difficulty), but the problem is that the goaltender won't allow you to score without luck, and you can't fully control where you want to aim. Even if you pass to a team member looking at an open net, you will often miss the shot. Not sure if this is due to keyboard control being too ""extreme"" due to it going fully up or down taking the shot, but if that's true then this is also a terrible flaw with keyboard control.Game is also locked at 60 fps. I mean come on. There is no reason to put FPS locks on PC games."
,Not Recommended,532190,34444565,Posted: 23 August,all,joeality,"Brutally difficult. The opposing teams snipes shots in from across the ice and their teammates gobble up rebounds constantly while your team is guaranteed to be out of position. Frustrating even on easy with a great team vs a terrible team because you're getting crushed.Some suggestions to the creator:When switching players it often switches to out of position defenders who are behind the player but closest so on an opposing 1v1 the computer controls your lone defender (who screws it up) while I'm frantically mashing switch player between the players behind the opposing player. Since I'm forced to catch up and holding the forward button when it does eventually swithch I skate the defender the wrong way. Instead it should pick the closest defender that's closer to the goal so you get the person in position to block them.Getting your players in front of the net would be helpful as well since right now they seem to be focused on getting as close to eachother as possible to make passing impossible. Have them spread out andat least have one guy in the back of the zone as a release pass and defense on a turnover. The main way to score a goal is either through a rebound or a one-timer but your teammates either run straight at you or run in random directions away from the goal no matter how long I hold the puck in the zone to give them time to get in position. Why not have at least one player try to setup some play.The passing mechanic doesn't work very well, I'll hold up and the pass will go right to a place with no people there. I can't figure out why it does this.Lastly it doesn't tell you who will be taking the faceoffs so I'm constantly sending people to the faceoffs throughout the game who suck at it because I don't know which position to put the faceoff guy in. Labeling who takes the faceoffs in pregame character select would be helpful so I can assign the most talented players to the right position.All that being said the game looks cool, has cool music, and is a great concept it just needs finishing touches to make it great."

,Not Recommended,532190,34334622,Posted: 18 August,all,EtherBunnny41,"Thought I could go into this with my Blades of Steel muscle memory, but that routinely caused me aggrivation. The base of what's here is good, and the promise of further development is keeping me from refunding it immediately, but in its current state I can't quite recommend it.Things this game doesn't have yet that I'd love to see implemented:- Ironically, a simplified control scheme. Since you can only pass or shoot while you have the puck, and you can only check or change character without it, you could easily double up on button usage. Pass/change character and shoot/check makes the most sense.- Team creator + named teams. Pick a country, pick a colour (or two), name your team. A small detail that endears you to your team just that much more.- Special shot types. Also goes well with the team creator idea, but could just be given to each class individually. The Enforcer's beefy slapshot is already perfect, but it'd be fun to have something like a slow-mo shot you can control somewhat, or maybe a super fast slapshot that doesn't hurt anyone, but zooms like a bullet towards the goal.- A Turbo meter. Not being able to catch up to guys as they're meandering across the ice doesn't feel great, so having a button that lets you speed up a tad would be nice, but should come in limited, replenishable supply. Could also use it with the check/shoot button to add even more impact to them.- Better One-Timer recognition. The ""pass and have the other guy immediately fire the puck at the net"" move refered to as a ""One-Timer"" is a staple of hockey games, and should definitely get some use here. Passing and then immediately pressing the shoot button should ideally result in some kind of bonus power or accuracy, possibly depending on what class the one taking the shot is. If this is already implimented, then it's less noticeable than I think it should be. Maybe add some flash to the shot to signify that it's a One-Timer.That's all I can think of for now. If some of this stuff gets implimented later, then I'll test it out and change my review later. As it is, the game feels pretty promising, but it's got a few things to take care of it before it becomes something truly great."

Most of the bugs have been phased out with the last couple of updates. However, passing is still an issue. Needs a line indicator to show where your pass is going or you will simply pass it to the other team. For a more arcade feel, it could use a system of power ups that appear on the ice through out the game, such as a speed booster, a power shot, invisible team, turn your opponents control inverted, just little things to make the game more insane.There needs to be a 12v12 mode that you can play with friends. Sure its fun to load up as many people as possible to play against the computer but it would be more fun to spilt the mayhem and go at each other. Also, I want to set up handicap games where I play lets say only two skaters vs the computers 4 to 8 players just for increased difficulty. Also on the third update, they added a pro level difficulty. It is beef supreme.I give this game a solid 9/10.Pros1. you can change the weight of the players2. you can decrease or increase the friction3. you can can play as 8 different teams.4. there are a lot of different difficulties for the players to play.5. you can win it all for North Korea.6. you can watch the Zamboni run over players during intermission.7. there is a 12v12 mode that brings a whole new meaning to chaos on ice.8. you can punch the ref in the face.Cons1. passing is a bit weak, cannot point the puck where you want it to go.2. no online multiplayer.

,Recommended,532190,34355168,Posted: 19 August,all,HalfBurntToast,"This game is pretty much Ice Hockey on NES (graphics wise) and NHL Hitz 2003 combined into a single game. It's a fast-paced, retro, arcade hockey game. It's not as fast-paced as NHL Hitz. But, like NHL Hitz, there are no rules, penalties, or play stoppages (icing, handpass, offsides, goalie puck covering, etc.) until there is a goal or the entire arena erupts into a last-man-standing brawl. The losing team to the brawl loses a man temporarily.There are some things that the game doesn't communicate very well to new players. For example, goalies will always block shots if they're in position to do so (essentially, it's a hitbox check with no RNG). So, it's essential to get the goalie out of position to make a goal as just hammering the puck directly at the goalie won't do you any good. Once I figured that out, and after losing many, many games figuring there was a chance the goalie would miss a save, I started playing way better (one-timers are your best friend in this game). But, the game never communicates this anywhere. This will probably be added later on, but a tutorial or training mode would help new players a lot with this.It's important to keep in mind that this is a local-multiplayer game only right now. No online matches. I'm fine with that, personally, but I know many who aren't. The only thing I'd like more right now is a franchise mode or an option to make your own team (with names) and an instant-replay feature on goals. It's a small thing, but it gets you a bit more invested in the players and game.Overall, this a great arcade game if you're a hockey fan or like really fast paced, crazy games."

The goalies are TOO F'IN GOOD. It is ridiculous how hard it can be to score a goal in this game (even on easy difficulty it is somewhat of a challenge). I had an overtime game against a very hard cpu for over 15 MINUTES because neither team could score a goal. I have 111 SHOTS ON GOAL and i only scored 3 FREAKING POINTS (I guarantee you atleast 70-80 of those were high quality shots on goal too). I usually only score about 1-2 goals a game and its crazy hard with a little luck sometimes. And no, manual goalie does not fix this problem since the cpu would still have an unstoppable goalie. If this could somehow be toned down, the satisfaction of playing this game would be awesome (That includes the players automatic goalie as well.

I never even played hockey games on NES or SNES (didn't get into hockey until later in life), but this is scratching that NHL Hitz itch I've had since the early aughts. So much fun and well worth the full price!"

Some things to keep in mind is it doesn't have penalties, and it doesnt have rules (no offsides or icings), you get in fights and whichever team wins gets a powerplay meanwhile a player is spazzing on the ice for a littlewhile spewing out blood :PTheres alot to like, single player is really compedative with the ai and i can just imagine the replay value with the local co-op. Great little game thats worth the $6 CAD i paid for it."

Would benefit from an online game mode to make it more competetive. Probably being worked on but since it wasn't included with launch it's not a guarantee. One can hope"
