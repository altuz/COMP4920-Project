Keep hitting reload button2. Throwing a knife isnt my strong point3. Leaderboard is a waste of time, as it appears to only be local4. Replay value reduced if all you are doing is playing against your own score.So overall, doesnt have the gun detail like another VR title but has the active enviroment of targets, so as long as they have a leaderboard thats worth having and update with more content, maybe a different scene to the current. I give it a 6.5/10, down from a 8/10 (Based on the progress since release, which is nothing)"
76561198111968299,Recommended,532270,26538935,"Posted: 11 November, 2016",all,Hammerark,"Really fun game so far but I did feel compelled to write a quick review due to one issue I had.There's a knife throwing stage that forces you to move to the extreme boundaries of your room setup due to a target placed behind a window on the extreme left. If you have what I would consider an average size room setup, for me that's 2.4 x 2.6 meters, this could be an issue for you. The major problem with it is the very nature of the knife throwing, obviously requiring quite a fast movement with your arm stretching out, and with there being no way to teleport (that I have found) you will find that you may hit something in the real world if you want to make that throw. For me that object was a 55inch Sony Bravia but luckily I got away with it, no damage done as I realised my mistake and was able to pull my arm away to lessen the impact. If you're required to move to the extremes of your boundaries then a teleport function is desperately needed to avoid potentially costly mishaps. I've not seen any warnings before purchasing this game so I wanted to make people aware of that. If it was a gun stage the issue wouldn't be so bad as you're not throwing your gun at the target, or at least you shouldn't be ;)Other that that I'm really enjoying the experience and I'll return to add more to this when I've played more."

76561197997794666,Recommended,532270,30163727,Posted: 25 February,all,Tikigod,"Excellent quick shooter.  If you are a competitive shooter and like practicing your quick draw and plinking, this is the sim for you.  It’s a lot of fun.  The gun models are rather large in size and simplified.  If you handle weapons a lot, you will notice the scale and mechanics feel a bit off and more arcade like (at least for the pistols) than other tactical VR shooters out there.  It’s the only quirk I have with this game. The 9mm Beretta you shoot with in most of the pistol rounds looks and feels like a water gun.  It’s about the size of a Desert Eagle which feels rather odd when holding and looking down the iron sights.   The strength of this game is the wide variety of targets and levels they offer.  This is where it appears they focused the most.   I really enjoy the randomness and unpredictable nature of each of the levels in this game.  Its a great tool to hone in your skills with the various rapid fire training exercises they provide. I just wish the scale and attention to detail in the firearms and the interfaces you were reading were more polished (the menus and textures to the weapons are very basic). I always enjoy the polished details some of the developers put into these games.   I look forward to see where they go with this sim.  I highly recommend it.   If you are into competitive shooting and you are borderline about getting this game.  Just go ahead and buy it.  It’s a heck of a lot of fun, and a great addition to any VR shooter collection."

The knife throwing is in nowhere near the same league and I was frustrated to see it cropping up so often in the later levels.The shooting feels incredibly accurate and makes you want to keep retrying the levels to nudge up your score (brilliantly designed levels too). It really nails that Point Blank/Police Trainer feelUnfortunately I hate the knife throwing  and it massively detracts from the overall game, the aim feels inconsistent but the worse thing is that the motion is jarring and strains your arm quickly, really not suited to a quick fire, repetitive high score game, especially when it drags down your overall score on a level.***Please please move the knife throwing  into separate levels.***Massively looking forward to the online scoreboards, my and a friend are manually writing down scores and emailing them to each other. The game gets even better when there's a score to beat. Will you be able to view friend leaderboards as well as global ones?"

It is thought out well, clever design, simple to jump in and out, easy to reload but you still need to reload the gun.Graphic settings are top notch because you can adjust the settings to SS 3.0 but then you will see your gun twitch.

Many, but not all, of the challenges are a lot of fun. However, I struggled with any of the events that required you to throw something. There is something not quite right about the way it works but can't quite put my finger on it. Some of the time the knife goes exactly where I want it and then another time, after completing the very same movement, the knife ends up flying way off the mark. On the other hand, any of the bits that require you to fire a gun are very good. The movie themed sections are particularly fun and the one which required me to shoot ""Harry's Gun"" was my favourite.The game might seem a little over priced for some at £9.99, considering the limited content, but I feel I've got my money's worth. I hope the developers will be adding a bit more content and I'm looking forward to the global leaderboards to come online so I can see how much better everyone else is than me."

It's immensely satisfying seeing the points rack up following a double tap to the head of your target. Even better when you do it while dual wielding.I've not finished all the rounds yet but plenty of longevity to this title. Always coming back to beat that last score.
,Recommended,532270,28497961,"Posted: 20 December, 2016",all,Sasselhoff,"Recommended with a caveat.This game was fun.  I have always enjoyed arcade style shooting games, and this one brings back memories of the ""Police Trainer"" arcade game I dumped many a quarter into as a kid (though, it falls quite a bit short of that and I would LOVE it if someone came up with a version of it for VR).The good:  Nice mix of levels, the 360 degrees of shooting is well done, the guns point and shoot rather well compared to the real thing, and enough different ""games"" to keep you interested.  Also quite polished, with darn good graphics and no bugs whatsoever that I could see.The bad: The guns and knives are just comically large in your hands...like you're a baby holding a gun.  The game is also exceedingly easy to get a lethal rating on just about every category (got lethal in almost  every one on the very first go around.  Knife throwing also needs a little work, as it just doesn't work all that naturally (and this is coming from someone who is actually proficient in throwing real knives/tomahawks).  The levels aren't random, if you replay a level it's exactly the same as the last time you played it with targets appearing/moving in the same place or direction.  Finally, you can beat the entire game in less than 60 minutes without even trying.So long story short, was it fun? Yes.  Could it have been longer and maybe have some greater difficulty levels thrown in?  Definitely.  While I'm not upset at paying $15 for it, as I'm happy to support any VR based design company at the moment that releases a decent game (if only to move forward the industry) I would have hoped for a little bit more content/replay ability."

Bought it on sale at -66% (5,09€), definitely worth it at that price point.Throwing parts were mostly mediocre, they are implemented well but personally I don't like mixing it with weapons.

,Not Recommended,532270,29235177,Posted: 13 January,all,Pop-n-Stop,"Good game but some of the replayability seems short. Would prefer it as closer gameplay to the 'Police Trainer' arcade game. I say that since this game has that look of red/white/black and progression but without quick continous action or accomplishment. In many games you want to start another level quickly or continue fast paced but this seems to lack that. As well, you would prefer a leaderboard that correctly depicts your ranking percentile.Recommending 'no' for the price point. There really isnt much to it as the knives and weapons arent highly detailed and many of the objects are reused so it doesnt feel like much for them to churn out different short lived scenarios.BTW, throwing knives and other seems hit or miss and can make an un-enjoyable experience."

I was right against the wall and had to get lucky shooting blind. My VR space is 2m x 2m. Besides that issue, a very fun timewaster."

Well suited to room scale VR.Two gripes:1) The throwing knives are almost impossible to use.2) A few scenarios force you to crouch down or move to some odd corner of your play area to get a line of sight to the targets.

There are special stages based on movie guns like Dirty Harry, RoboCop, The Man with the Golden Gun and knife levels. It's just target shooting, but there's huge variety in there, a lot of replay value in trying to better your score. It feels challenging, rewarding and has great sound. I got it on sale but even at full price I'd have been chuffed with it. Great game. Well done."

The graphics are decent for what it is and I had fun playing through it and will continue trying to up my own scores. The only negative is the knife play, I find it very hit and miss (excuse the pun) with its accuracy and how it works but - for the price - recommended."

Traditional shooters have waves of enemies that you kill. This is more like a training arena to sharpen your skills. It's rather enjoyable hitting bullseyes and trying to set speed records. Kinda like mariokart you keep going trying to perfect your run. I view this game as a more training then pure entertainment, but it is still very entertaining at the same time."
