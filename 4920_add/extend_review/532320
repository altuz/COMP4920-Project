,Recommended,532320,31406625,Posted: 27 April,all,boltz,"Played it for Wii when it came out and is one of my all time favorite games. You can tell it was originally meant for a controller but mouse and keyboard isnt too bad. It also does let you use a controller if you want that option. The camera does get wonky sometimes but its normally super easy to fix. Nothing different than the original ported to PC!FIXEDOnly bug encountered is that I have to go into the launch settings and hit play from there to get the game to launch. The game will not launch by only pressing the play option from Steam.Overall a great game and no major issues!! 10/10EDIT: The bug that I put above has been fixed as of playing 4/29/17, thank you so much THQNordic for still supporting the game!"

,Recommended,532320,31431864,Posted: 28 April,all,Judgeitobox,"An excellent Wii game, marred in its time by the 'map-a-basic-function-to-waggle' syndrome that afflicted many of that system's games. Now the affliction has been lovingly painted over* and you can revisit this game with a proper controller and fresh eyes.It was never the most challenging game, but it's one where the joy of movement, the ideas on display, and the presentation more than make up for the low difficulty. The revolutionary themes are blunt, but they play well today. Introduce it to the little antifa in your life.The port runs like a dream, but a sensitivity option for the camera would be nice (especially in first-person mode). Hopefully THQ Nordic and Blitworks can bring the sequel forward to the present.* Or, like the game description says, hook up a Wiimote and try for the authentic de Blob experience"

The only problem is that you can defintiely tell it was a Wii game by the controls. Make the camera more PC friendly and it will be fine."
,Recommended,532320,31426060,Posted: 28 April,all,Belgerum,"One of my favorite Wii games from back in the day. Simple, but lovable concept that gets a lot of things right in it's formula. The visuals, while not terribly advanced, are stylized to the point where it doesn't seem to matter. The music is gloriously funky, and the added charm of riffs and solos based on your color makes every action feel satisfying.I am VERY happy I got to relive this game, and that steam might bring it to more people in this day and age."

It's not a hard game, but it doesn't have to be. If you enjoy the genre at all, definitely give this a try. Though it definitely plays best with a controller/gamepad, it was not designed for mouse and keyboard."

,Recommended,532320,31439531,Posted: 29 April,all,Blattdorf,"From my brief experience, it seems to be a pretty well-made port. Everything works fine, not a hitch in sight, even has a few extra options on top, including arbitrary framerates.As for the game itself, it's basically a town-painting game. There's lots of variety to it, and I assume the game gets somewhat more hectic later on. It's really nice that the music changes dynamically as you interact with the world, so that just makes things all the more pleasant.I'll update my review once I progress further, but right now I highly recommend it."

The game was good still and it's even better with a good (non-motion) controller. And the soundtrack is among the funkiest ever made!This is also an incredibly kid-friendly game because the objectives and the action is easy for kids to grasp.

You control Blob who needs to put back colors into this transform chrome world. You will flip, jump, bounce and smash your way through the evil powerful I.N.K.T. Corporation. The platforming and gameplay are fun to play around with. The HD graphics make this game look better than ever. A problem I encouter is that the camera is clanky. Is not as intuitive as in other 3D worlds. It's easy to move the camera left and right, but the problem is moving it up and down. Still the game is playable and there are key bindings. I do recommend this game who enjoy 3D platforming and a settle down experience. Great price. Thank you THQ Nordic for this priceless gem."

,Recommended,532320,31434378,Posted: 29 April,all,Techbane,"Coming into this with a fresh perspective as someone who somehow only ever played the original Dutch PC tech demo and not the actual Wii game, I can say it holds up really well. It's like some kind of brilliant merger of Mario Sunshine and Katamari Damacy (or maybe Jet Set Radio) that strikes an amazing balance of atmosphere and charm with a decent degree of challenge and levels that can be both speedran and scoured for 100% completion. Other than the camera having a (very dumb) mind of its own at times, I love it.The PC port from a technical standpoint seems well optimized, and given it was originally designed around Wii controls it works just fine with a 360 gamepad (minus the occasional button-hammering segments). It has basically no graphics options, though, not even a windowed mode or any kind of resolution selection. Otherwise works swimmingly for me, but the absence is striking.PS: I also just discovered a pretty egregious softlock that can happen if you backtrack through a level after unlocking a gate. So the port job is slightly on the slipshod side I guess, but I'm still enjoying it enough to maintain a thumbs up."

,Recommended,532320,31451691,Posted: 29 April,all,The Good Sir Hatter,"This game is just as chill as I remember it being back in the day. de Blob is about a giant blob of paint who is on a quest to liberate Chroma City from I.N.K.T. You literally get to paint the town red. Or orange. Or yellow. Or whatever you want to paint it, really. The game has a lot of objectives you can complete, or not. The art direction is fantastic, colorful, and cartoony, but surprisingly enough it is not the strongest part of the game. The best part of the game is the amazing sound direction. At the beginning of a level, you select a track you want to play to. As you continue to paint, the music becomes more lively. Additionally, every time you paint a building, an instrument track gets layered onto the music, allowing you to play along while painting. The dynamic music is something that is hard to describe, but worth the price of admission alone. Pick this up, for what you get it's cheap as dirt."

,Recommended,532320,31477168,Posted: 30 April,all,ALIENCHICKEN,"This review will be split in 2 parts:I. The gameII. The rebootI. i won't talk long about the game(mainly because there are already enough talking about the game itself), i like the story, love the idea behind it, only thing which isnt that good is a lack of variety sometimes but thats ok but don't expect too much replayability.II. the reboot dissapointed me in some ways, the resolution of all the cutscenes, texboxes and the menu stayed the same.the graphic in general didnt really improve with the exception that its rendered in 1080p but nothing else, and since the original game is a bit old some of the little creatures seems to consist of only 10 polygons. The main thing which is negative here are the bugs, there are sometimes missing textures (believe me theres no bright pink/magenta in the game) then the best time is the time of the run in which you achieved your highscore so it could display like in my case 66min instead of 20 or less. The controls are pretty good for controller (with some exceptions in camera control which sometimes does some wierd things) i don't know about keyboard though.i also think they missed an opportunity by not inclouding steam achievements.(small sidenote: the game has no 21:9 support whatsoever :/ but can't really expect that but would have been a neat addition for ingame time and maybe higher res than 1080p)All in all if u haven't played this game at all i'd definitely recommend it, if u have already played de Blob and really liked it and don't have it lying around anymore sure go for it but if u have the ability to play it on your normal system then this won't be a huge step up and i think your money would be betther invested otherwise.eagerly waiting for the sequel to get ported"

This is almost as much fun, although I don't like having to keep track on how much time I have left. Fortunately, once you have played a level through, a free color mode opens for that level and in that, there is no time limit, so you can go exploring and coloring as much as you like. This game is great for all ages and player levels, despite the serious story (never has a story about an oppressive regime been so cheerful) and the time limit (just free as much graydians as possible to get more time)."
