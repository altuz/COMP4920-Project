,Recommended,532840,29511934,Posted: 26 January,all,Aythadis,"A really fun isometric point-and-click adventure game in a gritty sci-fi horror setting. The puzzles in this can be really hard to figure out, but thankfully there is a guide available to look at if you get stuck. This is set adjunct to the devs other game ""STASIS"" which I do look forward to playing in the future. This game is short, as it took me 2 hours to complete, but I felt satisfied with my experience with it, and enjoyed every moment with it.My only complaint that I could really point out, was the FMVs felt a little less quality compared to the rest of the game. Some of them were even just 2 seconds long, which is like why even bother?PROS:- Great atmosphere.- Great graphics.- Sound design is top notch.- Voice acting is good.- Good horror moments.- Nice and short.- Steam Achievements.- It's Free!CONS:- FMVs could have been a higher quality, a little longer.- Old School Point & Click tropes are present.- No Steam Trading Cards."

Early on you get a can of protein powder.  The description makes it seem like you'll be using it to wake someone up, or something to that effect.  What do you use it for?  Using it as an alternative for fingerprint dusting.  Except the last person to use a terminal was a guy in a giant psuedo hazmat suit, and the second time you use the powder, it's on a ID card that can also apparently double as a fuse?  There was no logic there what so ever.The last straw for me was to use a terminal to get a piece of information (room numbers), except for a few things about the terminal: 1.  You used it once before for a completely different purpose, and the new purpose was not there before.  2.  There was a reactor overload not 30 minutes before that logically would have fried it completely.  3.  The terminal is literally labelled ""Damaged Terminal"", and the description describes it as barely functional.  Why would I use a damaged terminal?  WHy not logically label the information I needed elsewhere, like put the room number on the wall?The story itself barely makes sense, and barely ties into the original game except by theme alone.  I found maybe one terminal that actually hinted at what really happened.  The rest I had to gleam from the message boards."

But if you like them, give it a try, it's entirely free to play, which is amazing, it even has some voice acting and cutscenes. And it has been transalated to many languages, and looks well done, which is just shocking for a free game. Could have been 5-10$ easily.The same developers got other previously released game you can try if you like this: it's not free and its called Stasis, but both share the same atmosphere."

The level of quality and effort put into this free title is outstanding, beyond what most other developers would do."
,Recommended,532840,29941711,Posted: 15 February,all,Oncus,"Pretty awesome game. It has more cutscenes than some AAA games.Positives- The story is awesome and the writing is pretty great.- The  visuals are great- The atmosphere is eerie, although it could have  had some more suspense and danger.- Voice acting is pretty good (not superb but for a free game it's amazing)- A lot of effort went to a free game. Wish we had more devs like this- Puzzles are decentNegatives- Some puzzles could've been designed better. For me it was the fuse box. But I guess it's pretty standard to complain about some puzzles.- There is one larger area that  you frequently cross, and each time you have to sit there and watch  your character run for a few seconds. It gets annoying after a while, especially, if you are lost and frequently backtrack.The positives heavily weigh over the negatives, and although this game is not for everyone (heck this genre isn't for everyone) it's worth a try for most hardcore gamers and definite try for genre fans."

Although the game is short, I enjoyed it, the story was interesting, the mechanics werent tedious as they tend to be with similiar isometric games.  The only negative thing would be the lack of clues or tips, because of that I had to backtrack a lot and backtracking allways sucks, other then that  great little game. Great job devs."

,Not Recommended,532840,29626306,Posted: 1 February,all,Amelia,"This game is for free, probably to drag attention towards the next big project that has been released on Kickstarter. While I think this is a clever idea and a good way to give a taste of what their games feel like, unfortunately the taste I got from Cayne was disappointing.On a first glimpse, it looks like a game with a very specific aesthetic and atmosphere, which personally I find very appealing. It makes you feel like you're about to dive into a small chunk of a big, immersive world. You realize it's not as wonderful as it feels once you get stuck on the first puzzle.If you like to proceed by trying to randomly combine everything with everything, then you'll get your treat. I prefer intuitive puzzles that have some logic, puzzles that make you feel satisfied when you figured it out yourself and not because you were lucky to click the right stuff in the right place. Unfortunately, Cayne disappoints on that aspect. And there isn't much left to this game that can make up for it.Voice acting seems to be good, but the main protagonist is obnoxious and just not pleasant to listen. The language used in general feels like taken out of urban dictionary (I understand it was supposed to bring out the personality for some of the characters, but for me it was immersion breaking). Gameplay feels sluggish, you spend most of your time trying to get from point A to point B. And the story itself, well, you can figure out the whole twist pretty much in the first half of the game (providing you didn't quit frustrated with the puzzles).Appealing aesthetic and atmosphere was what lured me in and I don't regret playing it if just for this sole reason. But it is not enough to recommend it :(."

While its release as a free game is likely meant as a marketing device for the developers' current Kickstarter pitch, CAYNE is actually good.The puzzles are relatively simple, and most of them make sense; I can think of just one that had a somewhat nonsensical solution, and yet that one was easy to solve. The puzzles are also not frustrating or annoying, with - again - just a single one that required a lot of backtracking.The game's main story, while somewhat predictable, is nicely told and deeply enriched by the side stories within the game. It's worth paying attention to every bit of lore in the world, as many discoveries become more meaningful the further the story progresses.The game is very short - it took me more or less 4 hours to complete it - but that actually works well here. Something longer would likely become repetitive, just as Stasis did near its end. Speaking about Stasis, I recommend playing through that game first - it's not required, but some of the things in CAYNE will make more sense with previous knowledge of the universe it happens in."

But - regardless of the price - it's a thumbs down from me wheras STATIS got a thumbs up.The story is barely coherent. Actually, it may not be coherent at all. There's a chick, she's preggers and....stuff happens. Much of the stuff isn't really relevant. The grotesqueries are over the top, there's a lot of screaming, everyone is insane and there's very little to care. I had to search the forums to piece together the story. I don't mind some ambiguousness in a story but when half of it ventures into ""WTF"" territory then there's something wrong with the way it's told.Furthermore, the puzzles were fairly stupid. Like (hey, spoilers ahead!!!) usinga broken scapel on a can of food so you can smear grease on a terminal to figure out which buttons people have pushed. Huh? There's ton of ash around you from buring fires and you want to use grease from food? Another has you accessing a terminal that's labeled broken yet it not only works it contains completely different information than before. Thus you're almost going to have to look at videos or read the walkthrough because the puzzles aren't logical.So what we have is a poorly told story combined with unintuitive puzzles in a world where everyone besides the main character is crazy. The only thing that this story has going for it is mood. Like STATIS it captures the feel of the original Aliens movie quite well. And it worked fine. No bugs encountered in two hours. Still, I can't help but feel that playing this was a waste of my time."

Definitely consider backing their funding campaign for their next game if you dig this.Cayne is a fun point and click game with a bad♥♥♥♥♥protagonist and some surprisingly tricky puzzles. The game is dripping with gooey sci-fi horror atmosphere. The writing in the game is strong and the voice actress who plays the protagonist is a lot of fun to listen to. Definitely worth playing.
,Recommended,532840,29544159,Posted: 28 January,all,Zacinoff,"Game Score: 5/10Cayne is an isometric point and click adventure game. The story was interesting with a minor twist that is revealed throughout. It took me about 2.5 hours from start to finish so a review of this game doesn't really matter much. For a two person dev team this is a really amazing game Brotherhood nailed it with the story telling and art. Voice acting was on point for each character and really gave them their own personalities.I'm not really a fan of point and click puzzle games so this didn't really do it for me. I got tired of waiting for Hadley to run from one end of the map to the other. I get it, she's pregnant, but damn, not a fun mechanic. Some of the puzzles were very vague and were not friendly to the player at all. I had to cheat and look up a walkthrough for a few of them. From what I've read online the story and ending are supposed to be a part of the Stasis universe which is another game from the same developers.Pros:- Interesting Story- Great voice acting- Nice graphics for a small dev team- Fun story you can piece together as you playCons:- Annoying puzzles and red herrings that make you think they are part of puzzles- As a stand alone it has a dumb ending but I'll have to play Stasis to get the full story- SLOW PREGO WOMAN made me waitI don't think I'm morally allowed to give a thumbs down to a free game. Especially one I played all the way through. I had some good times. But overall it's a mediocre game. Given it's short play time I'd say give it a shot if you're into puzzle games or if you like whipping grotesque boobies for pink grub milk. :)"

The story is quite interesting, the voice acting and cutscenes are actually very well done. If youre looking for a dark and disgusting game you cant go wrong with this. The game toys with the aspects of abortion which is an incredibly bold move for such a small studio so I will give them props for that but I cant stand the main character, possibly because she reminds me too much of myself. My biggest complaint has to do with some of the puzzle solutions, they make no sense. Why in the world would putting protein powder on a piece of metal to cut out a strange shape then make a fuze? Which is indeed a solution in the game that stumped me. Youre welcome. All in all though for a free to play game I dont regret playing it."

,Recommended,532840,29940919,Posted: 15 February,all,dairy farmer,"It's okay.I came for the premise, was turned off by the gameplay, but stuck around to see the story through.The story, setting, writing, and characters are all interesting enough; the PDAs especially do a good job of stoking the imagination. Voice acting is maybe just average to above average, with certain lines like the protagonist Hadley's one-liners and computer voices sounding awfully forced.But I think the worst part of it is that it makes the classic point-and-click adventure game mistakes. I'm talking non-sensical solutions to puzzles, lots of backtracking, watching your character casually jog over large areas, and extended non-interactive scenes that are drawn out for too long in an attempt at dramatic effect, somewhat like Frodo's ""oh no"" scene from the Lord of the Rings movies.To be fair, it was only one or two puzzles that were especially bad.The first puzzle involves moving Hadley during what appears to be a cutscene, which can be confusing since most people expect cutscenes to be scripted events where you can't move your character. After you figure it out (or look it up), it seems obvious enough though.And as far as I can tell, that's the only puzzle in the game where that happens.And the second... well, after I figured it out via randomly combining items, even Hadley ironically remarks, ""Wow, I didn't expect that to work."" Yeah, me neither. It's not quite Longest Journey rubber ducky bad, but I never would've figured it out if I didn't already have the items.After that, I just resorted to using a walkthrough, after which the game became more enjoyable. For what it's worth, the remaining puzzles seemed logical enough, but it's hard to be sure since I used a walkthrough.To be blunt, I think I would've enjoyed the game more if it simply had more scripted auto-pilot segments to tell a story with a few LOGICAL choice puzzles rather than being yet another adventure game where the objective is to click on everything or figure out what the devs want you to do.Sadly, I think these kinds of ""rubber ducky"" puzzles and other mistakes leave a bad mark on the genre and keep more people from enjoying, or even making these games. It'd be nice to see more games pushing to improve the genre rather than re-use tired tropes.And worst of all, if this game is meant to be publicity for their other games, it might not have such a great effect for people who weren't already fans. I've been looking at STASIS, but now I'm a little wary.I greatly appreciate the time and effort spent in putting this out for free, and it's by no means a bad game -- I just don't know how I would've felt if I had actually paid for it."

Haven't had to use a guide in the first 15 minutes of an adventure game before. The world could do with more horror themed adventure games but unfortunately this one isn't up to the mark.

,Not Recommended,532840,29578431,Posted: 29 January,all,Jirohen,"This game is Dead Space with Hillbillies.The beginning had me, I was excited to play this game, I was looking forward to something new, that is until I got to the first puzzle, that passed, I was glad it was over, and continued on, Until I was stopped by the second puzzle, and then the third, and fourth... I was already tired of playing this game, none of the puzzles make sense, not intuitively at least, logically sure, but at no point in time would you have thought ""I'll combine A+B to get C and then solve the puzzle!"" it had just become ""let me click on each item individually and spam the combine button because there are no hints to combine item A with B to get C, etc... nothing flows and so you're stopped periodically trying to find out what stupid combination works.The character developement is lacking, the main character is annoying, overly self depreciative and it just makes me not care to see her live through this ordeal, the other chracters in the game added nothing but more drivel to skim through while you attempted to figure out what you needed to do next, find a password, a temperature setting etc... they're all so extreme in their shallow stupidity you don't really get a feeling like they were ever real, like they don't fit in this game. it'd be a streatch on how they even fit in the made up company of the game as ""scary, deprave, psychotic, shallow."" as they're meant to be.Finally the ending of it all, it was obvious from the beginning. If I wanted a M. Night Shyamalan ending I'd much rather watch his movies then play this game, because I at least know it's going to finish in about an hour and a half, and would much rather save the last 30 minutes doing something else."

Everything looks kinda ""nice"" instead of dark and gritty.- Annoying unskippable dialogue and cutscenes that take away control of your character. Your mouse pointer disappears and all you can do is wait around for the boring dialogue to finish.- The story is threadbare and utterly uninventive and boring. You know from the very beginning who the antagonist is. You don't know why, even after the ending, because it just ends after 2 hours with no ""real"" explanation, though I can guess. It's still only piecemeal. There are only a handful PDAs of very ugly people (now with pictures) around that detail some of their moronic conceptions. Most of it can be disregarded anyway...- The level design: Instead of an advancing world, you're thrown into a ""hub"" area in which you have to repeatedly go back and forth between different ""parts"" of the game to collect 1 item, then had all the way back to where you started to use said item. And you're doing that over and over again. While in between the ♥♥♥♥ing long walks you could be listening to the ramblings of the characters, but alas, most of the time you can't move your character while someone is talking. Yay. Wasted time 2x.- The puzzles are esoteric at times. People get stuck in the first room ffs, because it follows no logic. Absolutely none. Not even the item descriptions offer any sort of clues. One puzzle really annoyed me more than most though: It required you to open a safe with a DNA sample...well, that DNA sample consisted of a voice recording and a picture!!!!!!! What does THAT have to do with DNA? Nothing! Absolutely nothing! It's misleading.- If you want your players to NOTE DOWN certain VERY IMPORTANT details in PDAs and on consoles, then at least a HINT what might be considered important would be nice. If you quickly skim over the very first console and don't realize that it somewhere lists a password that is required to progress the game...♥♥♥♥ that. Better solution would be to just have a ""log"" available for the character, in which all information can be stored. Almost any other game does that.- Item use is jarring. Instead of selecting an item and using it, you have to first open the inventory, then select the item, then close the inventory again. And if you're unlucky, some interactions just don't prompt any feedback and you wonder why it won't do anything. Looking at you, ♥♥♥♥ing fingerprints...-Character often doesn't run, but instead walks very slowly...great game design, when everything is already stretched to prolong the game, from the level design, to the guesswork puzzles.- The ""final confrontation"" doesn't make any sense. In no universe would that ever work. It would have been believable if the ""item"" was placed differently, so that activating the ""thing"" would actually lead to a somewhat predictable outcome and not to a serious hail mary...Overall Cayne isn't worth the effort right now, even though it's free. After Stasis I had expected more. At least that game followed some kind of logic and progression path. Thoroughly disappointed."

,Recommended,532840,29547278,Posted: 28 January,all,FantasticMrHops,"Having not yet played the initial game, STASIS, this was a great introduction to the point / click world that the Brothers have developed here. Everything from the audio design to the exquisite SciFi world building here evokes the same kind of dread that lurked within the shadows of the Nostromo of Ridley Scott's ALIEN. These homages aside, I only had to rely on a tiny walkthrough initially to avoid wasting time on randomly scrounging around, but once you get the idea for how the game wants you to combine parts, apply them to this / that it all starts to flow and you get the idea for how each puzzle is handled.Moving beyond the initial frustration within the opening moments of the game that I experienced it is easy to recommend this! You can beat it in under 2.5 hours if you're quick on your feet and it will net you some cool Achievements to add to your collection. Having recently backed their Kickstarter project for Beautiful Desolation I figured that this would be a good way to get my feet wet for their future project.Needless to say, it is free, it is fun, why not go play it yourself?

Then read this.Being someone who played Stasis twice, once and then stopped because of a bug. Then again to redeem myself..the second time I finished it. I loved Stasis. The story, the atmosphere, the monsters. Everything.CAYNE and STASIS are very different in the fact that it seems to me, in this game. The brothers focused more on story than atmosphere and there really was only one monster that really was able to kill you. Everything else was more or less docile.Another thing, Hadley is immune to explosions. Seriously, I lost count how many times she was exploded in the face. But also she can't be drowned either since she was dragged in by some white fleshy things.But she still can be mauled by Samantha? How is that fair?

In one moment she's hostile, then a second later she's asking ""Hey, can you help me escape?""If you haven't played the game, when you get to that part you'll know what I'm talking about.But anyhow I do reccommend this game because it's by the same people who did stasis and they are also doing a kickstarter for their next game which looks frikken fantastic.Another problem in CAYNE is that they don't exactly tell you what you can do with the tools you have unlike in stasis, it's a guessing game really to pick at what you can and can't do.But other than that, yes I recommend this game.So enjoy.Here's the playlist of my playthrough:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiiwEpSndQmclUAex5BDzLdyT_idWCH3_"

The puzzles in this can be really hard to figure out, but thankfully there is a guide available to look at if you get stuckThis is set adjunct to the other game STASIS which I have played and completed. This game is short, as it took me four hours to complete, but I felt satisfied with my experience with it, and enjoyed every moment with itMy only complaint that I could really point out, was the FMV's which felt a little less quality compared to the rest of the game. Some of them were even just 2 seconds long, which is like why even bother?CAYNE offers some great atmosphere and great graphics with sound design which is top notch. The voice acting is good and there are some good horror moments. The game is nice and short with Steam achievements and best of all, it's completely free!However, FMV's could have been a higher quality like STASIS has and a little longer. The game suffers with old school point and click tropes which are present throughout the game and sadly no Steam trading cardsBut for a free filler into the STASIS world and a promotional game for The Brotherhood's next project: Beautiful Desolation, this is quite good!RECOMMENDED :)"

The voice acting is surprisingly good, but the actual dialogue is really bad. There's a lot of humor, which immediately took me out of the horror mood. Also, most of it isn't scary, it's just creepy and weird, and not really in a good way. There's a lot of very strange sexual stuff that has no good place being there, it just feels wrong. It's also a very short game, which isn't really a plus or a minus but it never draws you into the environment/immerses you so it's not a big deal anyway. ALMOST FORGOT: Waayyy too much walking. There was some scary music at points, but it always petered away quickly, and there was just no pressure on me to do anything. I didn't feel in danger at all except for a few moments, and even then if felt like ""Oh I'm going to black out again aren't I? Oh I survived. Okay.""Overall, play this if you get scared easily, because it's not that scary, and if you like the typical difficult inventory interaction puzzles point and click games offer you'll enjoy it.SPOILERSThe game isn't scary because there is only one possible way to die, and it's when you enter a very obvious killzone. The singular monster that can kill you is shown fairly early in the game, and it's really not that scary. It looks very boring and unoriginal, but that's probably me being spoiled by playing better games than this. However, they give you no reason to be afraid of the monster: Hadley, the main character is never really scared for more than a few seconds, and at one point she vomits a bit but IMMEDIATELY quips a joke after, sounding perfectly fine and not psychologicallty traumatized like she seemed initially. In addition, it's never mentioned why the monster is scary. The game doesnt show what it can do, and even when you get the death cutscene it just goes to black before the monster gets you. Sure, they say it 'killed 5 guards' or something but it's behind an electric fence when you first see it, and there's no indication it can get to you or anything. If it had jumped into the vents in the ceiling or ran around to a different hallway, I would have been much more afraid of it getting me at some point (which doesn't happen anyway). Instead it just kinda disappears. I guessed the plot twist involving the baby as soon as you encounter the voice in the shrine room, and overall the chats between Hadley and the voice of the baby really just don't seem to add anything."

An isometric point 'n click adventure set within the realms of Sci-Fi horror, echoing titles such as The Matrix and Event Horizon. The protagonist John Maracheck is painfully awoken from his stasis pod and must do his utmost to stumble through a vessel of nightmares (The Groomlake) using all manner of items including a filthy towel found stuffed down a toilet (surely a tongue in cheek nod towards the genre's fondness for moon logic) to find his missing family.Swapping the characters gender, their main encumbrance from physical illness to pregnancy, we have CAYNE: A Stasis Story. On the upside you wont have any jarring surprises format-wise as it's pretty much a 'rinse 'n repeat' situation. That said, if you're looking for something different this time around, you'll be a little disappointed. I imagine The Brotherhood generously decided to give fans of the original another helping of what they initially loved, and whats more - it's free!Splatterpunk In SpaceHadley (well acted by Sarah Anne Williams) wakes up nine months pregnant on a surgical table. We hear an AI voice explaining to her that her womb extraction will be a 'selfless gift to science' and it may be easier if she were to 'think of the whole procedure as a bad dream'. Things are set up rather disturbingly from the get go, notably from Hadley's screaming which really does evoke the sense of absolute terror that she must be going through.Following the slightly unnerving opening sequence, we are then free to explore and click our way through an array of puzzles that range from slightly grotesque and amusing to the largely straightforward. The latter, thankfully being a typical thread throughout the majority of the games puzzle structure. Lets face it, there's nothing more frustrating than getting stuck on a conundrum, relenting to the use of a walk-through to find that the only circumstance in which the solution would've been clear is if you'd spent the evening smoking speed and getting drunk. Of course not every puzzle is delivered perfectly, but The Brotherhood seem to be able to implement hurdles that aren't too difficult to get over and at the same time feel very imaginative (if not slightly bonkers) to say the least.Similar to its predecessor, the UI in CAYNE is very straightforward and sticks to the 'Quantum Storage Device' method of inventory management. My assumption here is that this piece of in-game technology is the developers way of usurping that notion of disbelief that a character can carry around myriad objects varying wildly in size without so much as a holdall of which to place them in. Never really something that's troubled me, but being that I personally have a background of working in musical theatre where upon characters walk into a room and start singing for no reason, I've probably learnt to suspend belief relatively easily. Or maybe they just though it was a novel idea....Bite-Size Sci-FiOverall playtime reaches around the five/six hour mark depending on your affinity for reading character diaries (PDA's). It has to be said that they do a great job of fleshing out the story, character backgrounds and relieving a fair bit of the ambiguity which purposely surrounds the plot. However, similarly to STASIS I did find some of them to be particularly lengthy and it became a bit of a chore to read through them all. Having already played the first instalment I found that the PDA's can, although sparingly, contain the odd clue. Due to this I was careful to not entertain the increasing desire to skim read other than on a couple of occasions towards the end of the game. I also feel that this contributed towards the small amount of back-tracking becoming slightly more fatiguing than it should've. Being as the game space isn't that large or particularly complex, this felt slightly odd, especially as each new area has enough defining characteristics to set themselves apart from one another. I can only guess that it's the amount of intervening story info we're given that makes it easy to forget previous parts of the facility, some of which will need to be revisited. This really, is a testimony towards the writing more than anything else.The game looks great and sounds good to boot. The ever captivating isometric appearance has a well designed art style fitting perfectly into the modern look of a classic and cherished genre. Well written characters stand apart from each other in an intriguingly deranged manner, some of whom wouldn't look out of place in Bioshock's own, gone-to-pot city of 'Rapture'. Atmospherically we are given the odd bang and scream which are quite well placed, adding to the psychological horror; the subcategory in which the game primarily delivers itself.So, all in all the developers have created a pretty solid point 'n click adventure in CAYNE. On one hand it wont have you tearing your hair out at every other puzzle but on the other, it won't leave a particularly lasting impression for fans of the genre either. That said; it's free! Great for those curious enough to want to try STASIS but perhaps a little dubious about parting with those hard earned shekels.By OuttaSiteCheck out my channel for more reviews!:https://vid.me/OuttaSite"

A main character who breaks the atmosphere every five seconds with annoying jokes, memes, and quips. Like while the environment around her is a weird mess of metal, goo, blood, and fire she gets the bright idea to break the atmosphere with an ""abortion via falling"" joke. Completely unnecessary for the context. Now for the hour that I played this, this kind of thing kept happening and there were even moments where she would point out that it her ♥♥♥♥♥♥ memes were ""uncalled for"" in the given situation which makes me wonder why the creator thought that would be okay. When I read ""with a modern edge"" in the description I was worried/curious as to what that entailed, but now I've learned that that means breaking the atmosphere at any opportunity with terrible jokes and references. Now, away from the bad MC, when I started this game up I was impressed with the graphics, but I then realized how wierdly inconsistent the audio mixing is. For example, soon after the first couple of ""puzzles"" (Which takes the ""grab a random object and rub it against stuff until it works even if it doesn't make sense"" method) you meet a rather angry Iritish (Honestly couldn't pin the accent they were going for) man and for some reason this man is much louder than the giant electrical machinery and then the protaganist is practically inaudible to the point that I didn't even know she was talking until I noticed the subtitles. Another offender of this is the FMVs which are also 10x louder than the actual game itself. Now this game doesn't just suffer from inconsistent audio mixing and a terribly annoying twit of a main character, but it's story is painfully dull or at least everything that was supposed to invest me just came out as meaningless dribble. I'm going to go back to the Iritish man from earlier as shortly after you solve his ""puzzle"" (which consisted of finding a screwdriver and pushing random buttons until a generator blows up right in your face, sadly not killing the MC) he dies and drops a PDA which appear to serve as this games backstory ala Resident Evil or Silent Hill. Now the first PDA was a little rough, but it was interesting enough for me to give it a pass, it is a free game after all. However, the next one I found was just this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ engineer boasting about the stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥he wants to do as a ""New Years resolution"" such as getting a bird to call a horribly disfigured person a ""♥♥♥♥ing freak"" and eat an entire wheel of cheese a day. This is all this note consisted of. Literally get two character names, one of which we learn is horribly disfigured, and then the rest is just this chode boasting to HIMSELF (as it's his own personal PDA) about how ""awesome"" he is. This is where I decided that I couldn't deal with the game anymore. I have other problems, but they're more nitpicky than the previous stuff. Like I don't like how Hadley has to walk incredibly slowly to something if it's nearby rather than continue running. Another thing I have a problem can also be attributed to how annoying the MC is and that's how she doesn't seem to have any sense of fear or urgency. She just calmly goes about making jokes, having to keep herself from laughing at the man who lost his legs, and generally not giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥until the plot suddenly decides that she should. Like if any normal person were to wake up in the late stages of pregnancy in a strange facility that wants to physically extract the fetus from their body, they would be freaking the absolute ♥♥♥♥ out to the point where they wouldn't even know what a joke was let alone make them. Now the final nitpick that hit the final nail in the coffin for me was how the game likes to tell you when you can't use something, sometimes hinted (which is fine for the most part) and sometimes literally (Which is where my problem lies). For example, again in the room with the legless, haughty, Iritish engineer, when you finish the puzzle and blow everything up, again, there's a little button on the ground that seemed to be for an auxillery power of sorts. However, when you turn it on it stutters then shuts off. Now anyone that's played any other game with puzzles would probably think ""Oh, I can't do anything with this right now. Guess I'll come back later."" Well apparently the MC thought this too and felt the need to say something along the lines of ""This isn't useful.. Yet."" with the upmost amount of ""subtly"" one could possibly comprehend.Now, yes, this game is free. However, that doesn't excuse that it's still advertised as a horror game and proceeds to take all horror out of it by having constant atmosphere breaking things happen, mainly from Hadley herself! The setting seems interesting, the graphics and set pieces also look nice, but the story seems bland and uninteresting (granted that is a bit unfair as I only played an hour, but I think an hour should be enough time to hook the player) and the characters and ""professional"" voice acting was just laughably bad. This game looked neat and I really wanted to look past the initial faults with hopes that it would get better, but the game decided to take that thought and say ""I think you need all these terrible jokes, puzzles, notes, and characters to be good, so here's even more of them! :DDDD.""To sum it all up, this was a game that showed a bit of promise as a free little horror adventure game with it's high reviews and being a genre you don't see very often anymore, but it was brought down with bad writing, terrible puzzles that ranged from pitifully easy to unreasonably difficult due to the solution making absolutely no sense, and finally absolutely unlikable characters from the start.One last thing I want to say though is that I would love to see this developer make an adventure game with the isometric view like in this game, but I would love for them to do one that wouldn't be bogged down by it not taking itself seriously enough. Like if they made a sillier game like old Sierra titles like King's Quest, I feel like that would be a much better game, but sadly that's not the case with Cayne."

,Not Recommended,532840,29537567,Posted: 28 January,all,Canniballistic,"This game does a great job of getting you interested right at the start but just as quickly ruins everything.The art style is ok. Its nothing amazing though and its painfully hard to distinguish important parts of the environment sometimes. Also on looks, the cut scenes are garbage. They look like something out of the original Fallout games.The story (as much as I experienced before stopping) was interesting at first but after the initial interest from the first few minutes it does nothing at all. The only story elements you get are aweful dialogue, the set pieces which are interesting but too strange and the logs in peoples PDAs which are so bloated with large sections of boring crap, I stopped reading them after the first few.The gameplay is the worst part of the game EASILY. The puzzles are either stupidly obvious or they are so single minded that you just scratch your head and think what kind of mentally challenged person thought that specific process was right for the puzzle, and the game gives you NO guide as to what you need to do with items you aquire so 90% of the time youre just trying to combind a new item with every other random item you have in the hopes it combindes like some deformed transformers toy into some rediculous tool to advance the game. In fact the only time the game tells you what to do it kills you then restarts you with a new open door to advance the game...The one good thing about the game is the two main voice actors you hear, but their excelent work quickly goes down the toilet because their lines are ♥♥♥♥ing rediculous and go on forever like its the completely uncut LoTR trillogy.This isnt a point and click adventure... its a really bad point and click puzzle, more like youre playing Wheres Wally than something like Immortal."

All characters seem to share more or less the same psychopathic personality. The voice acting is good, but there are too few lines spoken. I expected the protagonist to comment on her surroundings more. Her sense of humor feels out of place in the genre, it breaks immersion and makes her character completely unbelievable to me.All in all, it's a decent game, I sort of enjoyed my playthrough, but it's not a memorable experience in any way. I can't really recommend it, unless you're really bored."

The game is short (finished in about 4 hours) and the story is linear, but the setting was what kept in going. Disgusting and creepy with some real shocks are the highlight of the whole game.The story starts great, but the pacing is weird and anticlimatic with an very disappointing end. The pda's where most of the story is revealed are slowly paints a grusome picture, but for me lacked any meaning in the characters other than them being sad and perverse.The game as a whole felt like a lerning experience for the dev team with many triumphs, like sound design, and a few failures with some cut scenes feeling very rough and rushed, but i'm sure with more time these things could have improved.Overall it was kinda disappointing game to play and i'd be disappointed if i'd spent money on the game. Some great idea can be found, but the writing has no real climax. I wouldn't really tell people to play this game as it just feels disappointing to have finished it as it is very unfulfilling."

Nothing to tell you where to go, or at least a given direction. Other than these 2 things, I really enjoyed the game. Yes it made me think, and that was a major plus for it, but when given like 30 seconds to figure it out, and not telling you this, kinda made it a little frustrating.

,Recommended,532840,29758036,Posted: 7 February,all,Coolnuggets,"In my opinion CAYNE is less of a game and more of an interactive short story. While there are puzzles and achievements, there isn't really much choice or actual gameplay. Fortunately the story was intriguing enough to keep me going.THE GOOD:-Psychological horror done right. There were a couple of moments that wouldn't have fazed me had I glossed over them, but when I stopped to look at them or think about it, the more disturbing they became. This is exactly the kind of slow burn horror that I find far superior to jump scares.-Intriguing story. Great intro to the STASIS universe. You get a handle for the gritty darkness, but are left with many unanswered questions. This is helped greatly by the visceral atmosphere. Who is Cayne? What's up with this Weyland Yutani wannabe company? Why do they only hire narcisistic psychopaths?-Likeable protagonist. Hadley was great. Empathetic and in an incredibly vulnerable situation, but still badass.THE BAD:-Puzzles were tedious. It was very easy to miss objects sometimes which lead to a lot of backtracking. While I don't think a game should be easy, it definitely took away from the urgency of the game. Running back and forth was tedious enough when I DID have all the items I needed. And when it did come to puzzling my way to the next section it usually ended up being a matter of use object A with object B. The in game solutions to Hadley's conundrums while clever were not immediately obvious to the player. Pesronally I think it would have been nice for games like these to have more than one way to solve the same puzzle, it would make the facility seem a bit more flushed out and would be more rewarding to player's ingenuity in a non-linear fashion.-Lack of urgency. With the exception of the very first gameplay scene and the end of the game, I did not feel a great sense of urgency while playing. This was odd given the circumstances Hadley was thrust into.-The ending. While it made sense and was definitely foreshadowed, it still felt rushed and gave me a lack of closure. It felt cheap to me. Just a few more details and I would have been a little more satisfied.-It was very short. As to be expected really, but it's definitely worth mentioning. I played through CAYNE in about 3 hours.All in all, if you want to experience a short and dark sci fi story, I definitely reccomend CAYNE. If you're turned off by tedious puzzles and want actual choices in gameplay, then maybe it's not for you."

It is incredibly immersive and fun to play..... hm... I mean SCARY....It's easy to follow what's happening, and it's worth the download and play, it's fee. And heck you can even get the Deluxe version, and also play Stasis...... Also check the new game the developer is making on Kicks Starter. Have fun..."

76561198027954037,Recommended,532840,29768938,Posted: 7 February,all,Horizonist,"The good:+ Same retro feel as Stasis.+ Improved graphics.+ Improved UI.+ Concise but comprehensive story.+ Isometric view is cleaner than in Stasis, making it harder to miss important spots in the rooms.+ The story and writing arel good, but lacks the suspense of Stasis.+ Voice acting and art are better overall, with the notable exception of the disaster that is your main character, see below.+ Puzzles require more careful attention to PDA content, which was largely missing in Stasis.+ Of course, it's free.The bad- The protagonist ruins the entire atmosphere of the game. Her lines are utter cringe, and her character is Jersey Shore levels of obnoxious. In Stasis, you perhaps got annoyed by your protagonist saying ""that won't work"" a million times, but here you try HARD not to mess anything up, since that means you will have to hear Hadley deliver another line. Why, Brotherhood? This is game-breaking.- Lots and lots of backtracking.- Some puzzles just feel stupid. SPOILERS! In one case, for example, you for actually have to backtrack ALL THE WAY BACK to the starting area after a given event occurs, and find a code on a random computer that you thought you would never touch again. That is lazy design, and gives no sense of achievement upon ""cracking it""."

You repeatedly get to points where you are using/combining items until you stumble across what the programmers intended for you to do, whether it actually makes logical sense or not. So while the game is pretty cool, it is also frustrating."
,Recommended,532840,30126857,Posted: 23 February,all,Jennova,"For a free game it is worth the couple of hours play time.Game play: Doesn't hold your hand, you only have a few options to deduct through so go through them all systematically to solve the puzzles. For a short game a walkthrough probably wouldn't hurt you if you get stuck.Story: Dark humour and story telling. Atmosphere was great. Ending gave me the chills even though I knew from one of the first dialogue interactions what was going to happen. There was definitely some pretty sadistic elements that made me question whether or not I should be laughing or cringing.Music/Sound/Voice acting: Amazing for a free game. Very well done.Graphics/CGI: For a free game again, excellent. I'm surprised they don't at least charge some small change at least. But not complaining.Over all: For a short point n click, it was a fun couple of hours. Some back tracking of walking which was a little tedious because of the protagonist's walking speed was the biggest pitfall. Ending didn't leave me with questions about the ending but more about the world setting. There was some obvious post apocalyptic under tones anyway, but still a tiny bit more back story or finality would have been fun. The total idea of the game would make an interesting larger scale game - but it suffices for what it is. Replay value is nill however unless you are going for achieves which are not obvious and I would just suggest a walkthrough from the first play through."

76561198032196978,Recommended,532840,29852703,Posted: 11 February,all,przemichal,"Well. Bischoff Brothers are said to have reinvented the genre of point-and-click adventure games. There's a truth to it indeed: CAYNE is an ABSURDLY good adventure game. Puzzle-solving never get boring or unintuitive. Also! Although it draws quite a lot from its horror inspirations - like the original ALIEN and its immediate sequel ALIENS - it somehow manages to build on them and - thus - becomes v. unique. There's one problem with it - and its the fact that its a little bit short (approx. 6-8 hours, 10 at most). It's free, however, so that's not a problem, espec. since most AAA games offer 15-20 worth of content.But don't get me wrong here. Even if it wasn't free, I'd still give Bischoffs m' monies for it."

,Recommended,532840,29583903,Posted: 30 January,all,Voz'Ghoul,A nice free game but requires player to be patient as the character moves and interacts with objects rather slowly. Players also need to be observant of certain texts and objects to make full sense of the interaction they have in the world.Some noticeable designs of the game.-Nice voice actress.-Humor under tense or inappropriate moments.-Suitable art for the environment and setting.-Inventory button pressing.-Slow paced game.-Involves backtracking.-Requires strong observation of certain world interactions.-Reading aspect of the game.-CGI animations.

,Recommended,532840,30125886,Posted: 23 February,all,Lumps Plays,"I didn't actually like this game. But it was good in most ways, I just didn't like the story and the walking.This is the first game I've ever played in this franchise. And right off the bat, I gotta say the entire plot was derivitive of the original Bioshock, saw the ending coming a mile away. I also played this game with my phone in one hand and the mouse in the other. The time she takes to hobble her pregnant butt across the walmart sized rooms is pretty ridiculous. During the time it took her to walk from one place to another, I'd get in 2-3 reddit articles.But those two things aside, the game was well made, had decent puzzles, looked great, sounded great, and is very worth your time if you're into the franchise. I imagine that would make the story more...meaningful. But if you're someone like me who doesn't have any investment into the universe it takes place in, you can safely skip this one. Unless you're bored. It's free!"
76561198147016964,Recommended,532840,30201876,Posted: 26 February,all,TheLordOfTheAshes,"It is free, so I can't complain. I haven't played Stasis, so I'm basing my review only on the very short game that Cayne is. The story is intriguing but is far from being memorable. Most of the puzzles suffer from the ""adventure game logic"" that was a trademark of adventure games from the 90s. Its retro style is pleasant, but the controls are akward. Plus, the game crashes randomly on linux (ubuntu 16.04) from time to time, so be sure to save regularly if you play on this platform.Anyhow, it is interesting enough to make me want to check out Stasis."

While I can imagine one way to exit the room, I can't figure out what to manipulate so as to cause the sprinklers to work.Review as of 2 February 2017Guess what? Sprinklers were a red herring!Thanks to the use of YouTube, I was able to get around times when I became stuck. Perhaps this game incorporates common tropes for point and click adventures? Anyway, the world is initially compelling, but the ending sucks. Not because it isn't necessarily a happy ending, but mainly because there is no damn resolution.The protaganist is compelling, but all the characters she interacts with are so demented that one can't help but feel that the devs are being overly heavy-handed in forcing a reasonably decent human being to see the persons running the facility as nothing but the scum of the earth.Still, the world is interesting even if the puzzles were sometmes obtuse. I wish there was a neutral setting instead of a binary YES/NO, response. In light of the fact that the game is free, I give it a 50.9% YES and a 49.1% NO recommendation, changing my final rating to just barely positive.If nothing else, this game prompted me to learn the power of YouTube in solving conundrums in point-and-click games..."
