A stronger silenced pistol would be nice too. Everything else about it I like. For the record, you can hide bodies with bodybags. I'm a great stealth game fan, but I see myself getting easily frustrated with this game because of the lack of saves. In fact my reason for writing this review is my hope that the developer wil add save points in the future. Without that function, I just can't reccomend it."

I love the stealth aspect and trying to figure out how to get through all the levels without being detected. Id really recommend this game to anyone who likes hardcore stealth.There is a few things that I dont like. I wish there was a Save feature, even if the save feature was limited like only being able to save 3 times would be so helpful. I also wish the silenced pistol actualy killed in 1 or 2 shots instead of using a whole clip on someone.but beyond those flaws its really fun and addicting"

Especially in co-op it is fun. Add to this the snarky british gangster tone and you got a indie diamond in the rough worth its price of admission."

76561198006217347,Not Recommended,533010,35442301,Posted: 3 October,all,Anticitizen1 [Raven Guard],"I like the concept of the game, top down heist game is a great idea. The execution however leaves a lot to be desired. This game has a lot of balancing issues. The starting guns are very poor, the stealth pistol cannot be used effectively against heavies since it just doesn't do enough damage to them to put them down before they shoot back. The gameplay is also heavily biased towards stealth, you are far less likely to succeed if you go loud. This is partly because the weapons come with a very limited amount of ammo, the rifles and the SMG's only only carry two spare mags which you would go through very quickly if a few heavies show up. That wouldn't really be an issue if the available arsenal reflected that but that's not the case. At least half of the guns are loud and stealth guns come saddled with lower damage. You will also quickly discover that there is a meta for a good loadout, there are two or three guns that combine stealth and good damage and that means that the rest of the loadout is almost worthless. Tacticals also have only a very small number of viable options, for example you would be crazy to take grenades over throwing knives.Another problem with the game is that there are no intermediate saves. This becomes a major issue if you decide to go for ""Completing primary objective undetected"" challenges of which there are 15. Say you stealthed 95% of the mission but the last guard spotted you? The entire attempt is down the drain. This brings me to another problem, usually in coop shooters, if stealth goes badly your partner can back you up and you can complete the mission loud. This isn't the case here since the MP is completely dead. You stuff up here, you better place mines and grab loud weapons quickly and hope for the best.Lack of content is another issue with this game. There are only 15 heists spread between 5 different areas so not only is there a very limited amount of missions but the areas are also recycled between those missions. Games like Payday 2 get around this by introducing procedurally generated layouts, this helps the replayability value immensely. This isn't the case here, the areas and even the guard and item placements stay exactly the same.On a final note, I would like to make a warning for achievement hunters, there is at least one broken achievement in this game. ""Bags for life"" does not unlock for on either of my two PC's. It does not unlock while meeting the minimum requirements of the achievement or even by picking up every single loot bag in the map and it does not work on different heists either. This is unlikely to ever get fixed because the game has been abandoned by the developer."

The game was harder then I expected, and was a lot more challenging and rewarding, in a Hotline Miami/Hit man indie cross over. Making my way through the level stealthy only to be seen and then having to fall back on old faithful... Kill them all! 10/10 would fail and kill them all again!"

76561197971724802,Recommended,533010,30259892,Posted: 1 March,all,Pontifex Maximus,"Filthy Lucreis an indie tactical stealth game, that challenges you to sneak around, staying to the shadows and silently take down enemies, or else bring out the big guns and blast through anyone who gets in your way.Each mission explains who you are dealing in with and as you slowly steal back your patrons treasures, you will be able to display them proudly within a vault inside of your hideout.You will be forced to deal with different types of enemies, and a host of different technological security measures such as cameras and lasers. Find inventive ways around them, or hack the systems and disable the alarms before causing chaos. There are also always a number of secondary objectives to complete, such as never being seen or robbing extra, hidden stashes in optional areas.The game is displayed in a typical top-down, isometric view. The visuals are good and pretty modern looking. And whilst parts of the UI and menus do look a little clunky and lack polish, the animations are smooth and the backgrounds are absolutely excellent.The audio is generally of good quality, the voice acting in particular is excellent and this really works well to flavour the murky London underworld you are exploring. The sound effects are likewise good and plentiful, whether you are picking a lock or destroying electrical conduits.Filthy Lucreis a fantastic addition to the indie stealth genre. The missions are varied and memorable, the large choice of weapons and equipment are excellent, and the addition of co-op play is just the icing on the cake.All in all,Filthy Lucreis just a lot of high quality fun.THE GOOD- Co-op stealth-heist action- Simple controls- Online leaderboards- Solid frame rateTHE BAD- The lack of a save function can be incredibly frustrating- Little variety7/10DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY |GOOD| GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE"

,Recommended,533010,28494586,"Posted: 20 December, 2016",all,EvilEyeV,"So it turns out this game is pretty good. It's a stealth/action game in a isometric world.Pros: Overall, gameplay is pretty entertaining.  You get to sneak around and kill dudes to get stuff done. There are interactable items in the environment as well as gadgets you can use to distract the guards. The missions take a while to complete (especially if you are a perfectionist like me).  There are many unlocks, each with an upgrade each.  Most of it is pretty standard stuff, just done in an isometric POV.  I guess there's a story too...Cons: The KB and mouse control bindings are terrible. The AI is pretty dumb.  The combat is jenky.  Especially with weapons... you have to be lightning fast and kill with all shots hitting to not fail the ""undetected"" task for the level.  There are only 15 missions total.Like I said, it's an overall fun game, especially if you like stealth type games. I would recommend it, but I would probably wait for a sale to pick it up."

For some reason on ultra settings the game crashed to desktop for me , my PC can easily handle the specs so along with some work on character movement which seems a little bit awkward getting snagged/caught on corners etc -- for me personally this is a worthy purchase , this can only get better . I really like the voise acting for this game title well done Devs will continue to play this game . Amazing what you can do with a small budget these days . Brilliant !"

I am good stealth player and I enjoy playing stealth game. But when I play this game, I always get into a situation dat I made a small mistake and to make a perfect stealth, I have to go through the mission again from the very starting point. This is just annoying and boring. Because of this I cant recommand this game."
