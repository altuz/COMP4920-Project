The one thing this game delivers on is being a gta parody, and not even a good one. A parody can only go so far. Graphicaly everything looks like it was made in ms paint. The camera just likes to do whatever it wants and the controls are terrible. All the dailogue is done poorly and is very uninteresting. In my personal opinion this game is a heaping pile of steaming turds in every way. I am amazed at how high the reviews are for something that's barely even a game. It's like something that someone handed in for a school project and got a D- on."

Fine, the humor is exclusive, and I did have a sensible chuckle every once in a while, but this is just bad. I will give credit, they have been fixing bugs for the last few months and the game functions, so that's something.

It's fake, the game doesn't actually load anything in the loading screen.Note for Unity developers: The developers of this game used some pre-made assets and kits, they compare strings which is bad and they don't use a general script that manages the variables for the game (For example: They have PlayerPrefs.GetInt all over the place, instead of creating a manager that has an int variable which is set to PlayerPrefs.GetInt(Whatever) and then compare that int variable that is in the manager script.)And of course they combine strings with the + operator which is bad."

,Recommended,533120,30593017,Posted: 18 March,all,k.,"This game is so bad, but that's what makes this game good.Okay, let's break it down,The game is made by 2 person, you can tell that they are Russians immediately.You can also tell this game is a bad version of GTA.✔ The graphics is okay, it's not good, and not bad either. Texture made by mspaint, and the model is very simple. But that is the point of this game.❌ The game mechanic is very simple, in free roam everyone is a car and no peds, and in mission everyone is human and you shoot other persons and also no cars. You can't get out of the car while in free roam, and can't enter vehicles in mission. You won't be able to hit peoples with car and also cant shoot vehicles on foot, Obviously because there isn't any.❌ Because of that, there is no point/no fun of playing free roam, or playing this game after finishing all mission. Except to start over.✔ Gameplay/Mission is just good, but not good enough, but it's funny, you can finish the game in about 1.5 hours.✔ Soundtrack (even there is only 2 songs I think) is good for indie game.✔ Voice acting is very very very very bad but hilarious, 6 character voiced by only 2. Again, it makes this game good.✔ Sound asset is so funny, if you laugh after driving a car, wait until you fire a handgun and RPG.✔ Does not found any major bug and crash in whole gameplay, ...❌ ... except the ""Free Town"" button (that I think it should be a cancel mission button).This is the kind of WTF IS THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥? yet I still curious to play it.

The controls are sub par, the gameplay is kind of mediocre, and the artistic style is painful. Regardless of these flaws, I'd actually still reccomend this game to an extent. The game doesn't pretend like its supposed to be great, so it ultimately achieves its goal. The layout of the town in game is also fairly pleasing, and the over abundance of references or just over the top sequences actually creates an interesting experience. Honestly I would probably enjoy the game more if it had a more detailed art style, butthe game didn't set out with that style in mind.Don't go in expecting a flawed masterpiece.

I never knew the Russian language is so well suited for rap music and MC Pox is now my favorite Russian rapper.  But that may be because I don't know any others.  The story is bad in a good way like almost everything in this game, so it's well worth the couple of bucks and time you'll spend on it.

,Recommended,533120,29373062,Posted: 20 January,all,Chef Curry,"First of all, I want to say, this isn't a game. This is an experience. A Transcendant Experience. I don't know where to start with this absolute masterpiece of a game.I will start with the sound design of VCB. The sound of a game remains one of the most underrated factors of making a good game, and the talented men who created this gem clearly understood this. The Audio Fidelity of this experience is nothing short of amazing. Everything from the cars to the guns sound like they were pulled from real life. This really helps with the immersion, as at times I felt like I was really in the game due to everything I was hearing.The Graphics in Why City are not as impressive as say, The Witcher 3, or Arma 3, or Minecraft, but they still manage to create a vivid, lifelike world for players to explore and enjoy. For an experience created by 2 men, it has incredible graphics compared to even many modern AAA games.While the story of the experience is not as important as other factors, the small 2 man writing team still managed to create a gripping tale of intrigue, romance, and betrayal. The main character Vano is joined by an enigmatic and colourful cast of characters, my favourite of which was the vertically impaired rapper MC ♥♥♥♥er. The story in essense is just an excuse for the gameplay, but regardless it still manages to be interesting and even emotional at times. The Ending made me both laugh and cry.Now for the most important part of any video game, the gameplay. VCB takes inspiration from 3rd person shooters such as Max Payne, True Crime, and maybe even a tiny bit of the Grand Theft Auto Games. The driving is smooth and intuitive, and while there is not a very large selection of vehicles, each one is lovingly crafted to be unique. The gunplay is where VCB truly shines. The wide array of weapons each feel different to use and the difficulty curve is more than reasonable.I feel remiss to give this game less than a solid 10/10, but I feel it is my duty to do so. So, my final rating for this experience is 9.9/10. I took away this tenth of a point as a warning to all potential buyers: This game may make you enjoy other games less. If you are brave enough to take this chance, then I urge you to purchase VCB. At the time of writing this experience costs $2.99, but It is truly worth any price presented. I would go as far as saying that this is the second best game/experience of all time, behind Simpsons: Hit and Run. Truly unparalleled."

So, some advice to creators:- Как вылазить из машины,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- В сюжет вставьте плиз Ваномаса, че за игра без Ваномаса?- Побольше МС Поха.- Пригласите еще актеров озвучки, желательно Петра Гланца...А так идея нормальная, ребят, дерзайте, развивайтесь, творите, слушайте батьков российского игропрома, удачи вам.Не зря отдал 78 рублей. 7/10"

But the humor kept me playing. The bad graphics and the horrible voice acting just added to the humor of the game. The entire game was made by two russians with the exception of the music. The missions where you shoot down hoards of haters were extremely fun. The missions where you had to drive around were challenging due to the fact that the driving in this game is horrible. The final boss battle is truly magnificent, I won't spoil it but it's definitely worth playing to the end. In conclusion, the game has it's faults, but the humor and the missions will keep you playing to the end. I honestly reccomend this game."

The controls are a bit slow, but it adds to the comedy. The style is a combination of GTA III, GTA: Vice City, and GTA IV. The traffic is weird but otherwise the game is kinda awesome; the sound effects from shooting guns are actual ""pews"" and ""bang-bangs"" that the two dudes made themselves. The story is kinda irrelevant, where this guy comes back to this town and his friends and family, gangs, etc., but otherwise the actual gameplay is entertaining and just because of how unique the game is, I recommend giving it a buy, and to help support thos e poor kids in Russia."
