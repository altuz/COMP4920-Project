Same goes for the chickensIs this a BETA version?+ You get Steam Cards+ Easy achievementsp.s. Khernya!

,Not Recommended,533150,33015757,Posted: 29 June,all,berzha101,"Super LOH is a rather difficult rogue like game for the wrong reasons.Basically, the goal of this game is to clear out all the enemies in a room and then advance to the next room. However, the difficulties of the rooms are random, and sometimes you get these ridiculsouly hard rooms that are just impossible.I also say rogue like, but you don't get to keep your upgrades from playthrough to playthrough. Additionally, when you attack, you get pushed back which is super annoying. I played enough of this game that I was actuallly able to 100% achievement the game, but I would not play this anymore or any further. Another rather annoying part is that the escape button does not bring up a menu, but instead closes the game.Overall, not that great of a game because of random difficulty swings that make the game annoyingly hard.Rating: 5.3/10Recommend Price: $0.49 or below"

,Not Recommended,533150,29928869,Posted: 14 February,all,Therieri,"As others have said I can't say this is finished game. As free this game would be okey but now it's just unfinished game which little like The Binding of Isaac but without any effort. Game is unfair and it is that by bad way. Its enjoyable because of RNG and there isn't any kind of goal this game. It's just endless loop.Musics could be worse. But there isn't even any options in this game. That means you can't even turn music off. This game have maybe two different music tracks. One for shop and one for everything else. When you listen those enough it start to be really annoying. You have ""options"" button but it just say this game doesn't include options. Haha so funny... not.You finish level and go to another level. You have only two skills. Bomb and normal projectile. Levels have different layouts. Others are fair. Others are not. You can buy some items (better staff) or hats which are only for achievements. Thats it.I just simply can't recommend this game to anyone."

,Not Recommended,533150,30041839,Posted: 19 February,all,Hawk Zombie,"Well. What can I say about this game? Played it for 22 minutes and got 100% achievements...and only because I felt I -had- to. If you're like me, if you unlock an achievement in a game you can't just let it sit. Thankfully, it wasn't hard to do. Just get enough money (300) to get the wand and the hats are random.Anyway, I can't recommend this game, even though I bought it for 50% off, and even though it has cards, I just don't feel it is a very well made game. The controls are too floaty, there are no options (?!) and they put the restart button right next to the use button (?!?)+Quick and easy achievements. If you're looking to bolster your 100% quota, do it. Won't take more than 20-30 minutes.+Pixel Graphics are well done, and it's easy to tell what it going on and how.+Low, LOW price point.-No options. In fact, you go to the options section, and it basically mocks you. The music is way too loud, and there's no way to make it windowed from within the game.-No pause. Hitting ESC closes the game.-The Restart Button R is -right- next to the Use Button E. WHO DOES THAT?!-Floaty. WAAAAAAY too floaty. In a bullet-hell type game (which this is reminiscent of) that does not bode well.-Every weapon has a serious knockback and you're spending more time fighting with it than avoiding enemies and their projectiles.I got 100%, but I am going to refund it. As it sits, not worth it even at 50% off and with the low price point.TLDR: Floaty controls, bad design choices, not worth it."

,Not Recommended,533150,32181627,Posted: 4 June,all,MrDowntempo,"This game, while not horrible, or broken, IS fundamentally flawed. The levels seem chosen randombly without a clear sense of progression from one to the next. The lack of an option menu is a problem, despite the ""we don't have an option menu"" achievement. Some of us would like to turn the music volume down. The gameplay though, is functional if simplistic. Still I can't really recommend this since there are plenty of better similar games for only a little bit more money. I unlocked all the achievements in under an hour, and really can't say I enjoyed it."

,Recommended,533150,33200570,Posted: 3 July,all,Ashes,"You run around and shoot monsters.The game levels are random.Sometimes you start on really hard levels, others really easy, to get a streak you kind of just have to get lucky and not get the super hard levels. Some of the levels are nearly impossible to beat, which makes the game a bit unfair.I got all the achievements in it in about an hour.6/10 Spooky"
76561198141937508,Recommended,533150,34400774,Posted: 21 August,all,Jopas Jas,"My first impression was horrible. It seemed impossible to clear a level. But I wanted the achievements, so I kept trying. Eventually, I got behind the patterns of the monsters and made it to level 7 and killing 92 monsters. I am quite proud of that. R-Type seemed impossible as well. Or Ghouls'n'Goblins. But did I give up? Yes, like every sane person did. I kept on playing Super LOH for a bit even after I got all the achievements. The song is catchy. Also positive: The game is only 7 MB small. Could always install it again quickly for a game, should I ever feel like it."
,Recommended,533150,34944714,Posted: 14 September,all,haecz,Fun game but very frustrating at some times.+ Fun and challenging+ Easy to learn- Game crashes when you press ESC- You often get stuck in the wall (between loot and wall)- Buying health doesn't give you enough HP (should be 25hp+)
,Recommended,533150,35087140,Posted: 20 September,all,Tezlakipuka,"+ lovely level and character design+ the soundtrack is nice, but repeats quite fast+ great variety of levels, but the difficulty is inconsistent (you should buy a better weapon fast)+ easy achievements- all enemies are braindead, just running around aimlessly- no menu or settings, and escape key instantly exists the gameOverall, a decent roguelike with lots of potential for further development. The price of 0,99€ is fair"
