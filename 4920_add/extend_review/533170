,Not Recommended,533170,29122312,Posted: 8 January,all,Zangorwarrior,"SPOILERS!!This game isn't really a bad game nor is it a good game. It's somewhere beween the middle.It's one of those short indie game titles that is more to make you waste time if you have nothing else to do.You control a guy who chats to a girl named Lucy when you discover that she's dead all along and in the end, you bury her to finish the game.After I have completed it after figuring out through the ""trial and error"" method of playing, I just said ""THAT'S IT?"" It just shows you a title card saying ""WINNER"" and that's it. Nothing else to it.There is one way to finish the game and other ways lead to certain death animations. You get different dialogue choices but they don't benefit anything apart from you dying in a multiple amount of ways.It had a great atmosphere to start out with but once you keep dying and trying to piece the puzzles together, it loses the atmosphere and the horror this game was going for. Feels more like a chore then anything.I'd say pick this game up if you willing to pass the time and not get too involved in the story and everything."
,Recommended,533170,29131146,Posted: 8 January,all,Malkavian,"Disclaimer: This review contains spoilers. I also made a guide for those of you who are stuck! Hope it helps.DCWSsuccessfully creates a creepy atmosphere and although most of the choices given seem either arbitrary or useless, there is a purpose, and there is a hidden pattern.This is a pixelated horror point-click puzzle adventure game with an excellent soundtrack, interesting lore, a permadeath mechanic and the best in-game arcade game since Galaga (ha!). This game pursues an interesting philosophy where the method by which the player explores or uncovers certain information that propels the game forwards is death. You click, you die, you learn something new about the puzzle (be it the about the stranger, the room or the story in general) and you start over until you know exactly what to do. That, or, you're an incredibly experienced gamer who mainly focuses on puzzle games and deduces exactly what to do from one or two attempts.Most of the game is spent chatting with a strange woman online. Using simple point-and-click mechanics, you try to uncover the secrets behind this mysterious stranger. If you play your cards right, you'll get to have odd and surreal conversations with 'the stranger' that reveal interesting, yet puzzling bits of information that progress the story forward and clue you into what this is all about. If you don't, then you die, and have to start all over again. Your options are limited, yet you never feel trapped. You can walk back-and-forth in your room, interact with a few select objects, chat with the stranger or play minigames on your computer. However, the game is presented in a way by which every object has its place, and if you solve the puzzle, you will know exactly what to do and each objects purpose. The soundtrack is great. Especially the unknown piano song and the soundtrack to Mechs v. Fruits.The only few things that bother me are the following:The minigame Mechs vs Fruits has two bugs that appear infrequently but can mess up your attempt at gaining the achievement for reaching Level 10 OR the main-story. Sometimes you spawn right next to an enemy and die. Other times you spawn trapped in an eclosed area where you cannot kill all of the enemies.The radio sound is so loud and unpleasant. I do not know if it was on purpose to force the player to painstakingly listen for importan clues during certain areas but regardless, it's unnecessary.SPOILERS!The whole overdose thing makes no sense to me. Why is that death triggered? Is it the door? Is it something to do with the gas? Never figured that one out.All in all, the game needs a few small patches but it is fun. Maybe extend the story with DLCs.If you enjoy the way I review games, join and follow my curator group! It comes with a fun discord channel for horror fans to chill and game.Malkavian Madness"

This is obviously not a finished product with mistakes that range from mild annoyances (stuck in minigames, enemies spawn on top on you in mech minigame) to really inconvenient things like text loops. Not to mention like spawning a copy of your character, I mean, come on...This might be worth your time if you are a fan of a point and click puzzle games, but overall I would recommend to wait for a couple of updates that fix the most obvious flaws."

,Not Recommended,533170,33962111,Posted: 1 August,all,Laughing Soul,"Well this was interesting at first but quickly got boring. So many different choices just lead to her leaving the chat and you dieing with the hanging ""you left me"" ending. I tried alot of different chat routes, almost every one of them ended in that ending. even the phone call ends with that. This game just seems lazy and unfinished and is not worth $5.tl;dr dont pay for this, just play sara is missing. its much much better and its free."
,Not Recommended,533170,29207900,Posted: 12 January,all,EmP,"Don’t Chat With Strangers is a simple game, but it uses that simplicity to drive your patience hard into the ground.  At heart, it’s a straight-forward point-and-click horror tale about answering a late night instant message on your computer from an unknown girl.  And then probably dying a gory, pixelated death shortly afterwards.  There are ways to avoid such an end, but odds are, you’ll fail to find them in a time frame that holds your interest.There’s nothing wrong with a game punishing a player with constant deaths in an attempt to have them eventually learn from their mistakes and find the answer to a puzzle.  For the first few attempts, there’s nothing wrong with how Don’t Chat With Strangers sets out to kill you.  There’s a very linear set of answers to employ during your online discussion with the mysteriously fatal Lucy1, certain things you can say and actions you can undertake that will prolong your life just long enough to sneak a little further into your conversation.  Finding the solutions to these puzzles is, for the most part, pretty satisfying.   There are sensible ways to keep the girl happy and, therefore, to avoid dying an awful death.  Some are more obvious than others; should she request to play an online game, don’t destroy her at it and then act smug.  Though it will rarely lead to your murder outside of this game, I’ve learnt that girls often don’t like that.Other solutions mean trying to find a way around a pesky system update and a corresponding computer crash destroying valuable information - an issue that also has a practical solution.  The problem is that additional complications crop up that need to be circumvented through mostly trial and error, leading to multiple deaths and repeatedly forcing you to retread old ground.You can read the full review by clicking on these words right here."
,Recommended,533170,29065181,Posted: 6 January,all,PatsDark,"Well this is interesting... I saw the game two days ago in the coming up list on steam and it appealed to me so i tought i'd give it a try.The game itself is all spent in your room, mainly, where you click on an object and your guy interacts with it. A lot of it results in death. You interact with this girl Lucy on a computer through a choice of answers, so far most of wich results in death. It is an interesting premise, and so far i had a good laugh in a few occasions. My guess is once you know what to click and what to answer and in what order you will not touch this game again. But getting there is a puzzle that is fun.Don't expect the greatest game ever, it is more of a experience/puzzle game at heart but it is charming and unique enough to give it a shot. Also it isn't expansive wich is good."

The sequences became tedious, and the game felt less and less horror, and more like ""Button press simulator 2017"" I found my self completely disinterested by the end of the game.It felt unfinished, and the bugs/glitches didn't exactly help with immersion. The ending caught me by surprise, and not in a good way.*Edit* Short gameplayhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ittzfOQo82g"

I hope devs wont abandon it and release an update or two to expand on a story more.(SPOILER) One thing I find funny how this guys face never changes he is like ""Oh flying demonic cross in the middle of my room? Meh seen that"" or ""Im digging a grave for random dead girl who I talked on the interned. Meh been there, done that."" He has ultimate dont give a ♥♥♥♥ face."
76561198219434583,Recommended,533170,29101416,Posted: 7 January,all,AhGooseTeen,"I, like other reviews, thought the game was just a cheap death simulator at first, but after much trial and error, there is a God.If you don't like games that take a LOT of trial and error, this isn't for you. But if you're like me and like puzzles and horror, I'd recommend getting this game. It reminds me of Emily is Away, but with a horror atmosphere... and LOTS of dying. Like in Pony Island, you have to pay attention to every detail in the game, and explore every avenue before you will be able to make progress.The permadeath feature will get frustrating, but if you're a fan of point and click horror, it will make the game that more rewarding if you can beat it.I give a few tips about how to survive Lucy at the end of the video below:https://youtu.be/-1WnFib0iDQ"
,Not Recommended,533170,29493270,Posted: 25 January,all,Cthulhu Redux,"Do you like Trial and Error? Do you like mind numbning repetition? Do you Like Illogical solutions that force you to consult a walkthrough in order to progress? No? then you won't this game. Although this game boasts a really cool concept and really cool art and death scenes it's mainly just an excercise in futility until you consult a walkthrough...and find out that the ending is a screen with a single image and a single word...It gives you no explanations or closure on the tiny story details you glean during gameplay...Nothing. I really Wanted to Love this game but I can't Reccomend it, It's all style and no substance.Here is a full play through start to finish without all the repetition, It takes about 8 minutes:Spolier warning the ending is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RgL4kJgS88"

You'll also be railroaded into death for often times arbitrary reasons. Honestly, I wouldn't even recommend this title during a sale, you can simply see the content without jading yourself by watching it on Youtube."
76561198279707908,Not Recommended,533170,29174255,Posted: 10 January,all,bloodmagicbae,"(Minor Spoilers) I like the concept of the game, but the numerous ways to die eventually gets in the way of actually completing the game to such an extent that even doing things needed for survival or just taking too long to play an in game minigame is enough to get you killed. There's plenty to like but it all goes to♥♥♥♥♥♥when you realize the amount of problems you have to go through just to beat the damn thing.To add, the somewhat fun minigame occasionally spawns your character in an enemy which is an instakill in the game. That makes it that much harder to actually get around to beating the actual story since completion of the minigame to a certain extent is necessary to finish it. I'd normally be willing to put in that work, but after the 9th time of encountering the same problems for a relatively simple story I eventually just got bored and gave up.Overall, I can't say the game is really worth the cost or frustration. It's fun in bits, but after a while it's just flat out annoying."

To revel in the 16bit deaths.2. To piece together whatever bits of backstory I can find.So far it's proven a little frustrating. Nailing down the ""lore"" is kind of hard when you die all the time in the same way over and over again.All in all, I guess I'd say just watch a youtube video."

76561198143030878,Not Recommended,533170,29071528,Posted: 6 January,all,blumenleere,"It would be a fun little game (in fact more of an experience than a game) for 1 Euro/Dollar max, but that's all.Afer 3 minutes I had 4 archievements of 17. I didn't even try to do something special.But it is obvious where this is leading.You can't do too much. You have your character sitting in front of his pc and then you can play little irrelevant games (pushing a button and some kind of minimaze) or chat. When you chat, you have nearly no options and the different things you choose lead to death or perhaps, if you do everything ""right"", you will maybe find out more about the background? But after this isn't worth the money in any way, I requested a refund and say: don't let people like that publish their games on Steam. Only if the value of the game is represented by the price it costs.I think the dev is probably someone with not too much experience in programming games (I don't mean the graphics with that, I mean the game mechanics and the story). It's not enough for a game to be worth playing to have something gruesome happen within a few seconds. That lacks substance. You control the game with your mouse, but your actions are very, very limited. Less than in an escape the room game. The game fails to create a mood of tension, because everything happens too fast. So, this game is more the template of a game like some games that are published on gamejolt than a professional and polished game that promises to give the player something in return. Wanting five dollars for something that seems more of a try to practice game programming skills than the project of a professional dev who knows what he is doing isn't OK in my opinion.(By the way, you have to use Alt-F4 to end the game, not even that was programmed.)"
