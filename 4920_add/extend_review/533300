This is a pack of 118 nearly free achievements under the guise of a game. The reviews are Overwhelmingly Positive because of this. The free achievements seems to blind people to the game's quality, because I've seen some call this a fantastic game or even the best puzzle game ever. The gameplay is about the same quality as dozens of free flash games out there. Your goal is to get a blue square to land on each level's green area, and can detonate red squares to move the blue square or clear yellow squares out of the way. As you progress through the levels some more obstacles appear, but it never gets challenging and is just trial-and-error from the start.If achievements are all you're after, go ahead and buy this. If you actually want a good and fun puzzle game, you're much better off looking for something else."

(Along with with other gamers who are interested in puzzle games like this one)Alright, since this is a simple puzzle game, I'm not going to go into much detail.You have 3 types of building blocks (Literally) which have different functions that appear on a platform in each level and 2 additional types you will encounter as you progress through the game. There are a total of 40 levels altogether.Block TypeFunctionRed BlockExplodeYellow BlockEither a helping aid / obstacleBlue Block*Objective**Purple BlockSame as yellow, but fixed**Green Block***Moves in a specific sequence; obstacle*Your objective is to have the blue square land on the platform**The blocks you'll come across later in the game***Will stop in its tracks if interacted in any wayLike I just mentioned, you have to get the blue square to land on the platform in order to move on to the next level. The early levels only require you to use the red blocks in order to launch and aim the blue block toward the platform. The later levels may require a bit of timing and strategy (But it's notthathard). Honestly, it'll probably take you about 30 minutes to 100% the game so you don't have to worry too much.What did I think about it?Zup! has a unique concept different from other puzzle games that was executed quite well in my opinion. I really enjoyed playing this even though it was really short. Also since the achievements are very easy to get and most of them are a plethora of letters and even symbols, this game makes a great alternative to LYNE; so if you want to customize your achievement showcase, then the achievements will provide you a wide variety of customization. The amount of customization will be even bigger if you also have LYNE achievements to go with it.In conclusion, Zup! is a simple, yet satisfying puzzle game that Achievement Hunters and most people will enjoy. As most people would suspect, this game is most likely intentionally made so that people can easily get the achievements for use in their achievement showcase.Should you buy this game?I highly recommend you should. Super easy achievements you can use for customizing your achievement showcase, good gameplay, trading cards; what more could you want for $0.99? Well, except if you want a challenge, then this isn't for you. Consider taking a look atLYNEas an alternative option!9/10"

The goal is to land the blue block on the green platform. To do this you must explode the red blocks which will launch the yellow blocks away from the blast allowing the blue block to reach the platform. Most levels have multiple red explosive blocks, so your job is to figure out which ones to explode and when.+ Creatively designed levels which keeps the game feeling fresh and enjoyable from start to finish. (pretty surprising considering how simple the concept is)+ The game has the right balance of not being too difficult while still being a fair bit challenging. Some stages make the player think a fair bit in order to find the solution.- Sometimes the physics feels a bit ""random"" making a few stages reliant on luck which can be a bit irritating."

It takes about 25 minutes to get all the achievements so in that regard it’s faster and easier than LYNE (I still haven’t finished LYNE yet).From the reviews I’ve read on the store page no one has mentioned what you actually have to do in the game. The objective is to get the blue square on to the green surface by using the red cubes to launch it and the other yellow squares into the air, if the blue square lands on and doesn’t fall off the green surface you complete the stage.The game is mostly trial and error, the devs for about 35 out of the 40 stages have done the work for you and you can just click on the block and watch it fall in the right place without any effort. The other 5 stages or so require you to time the physics of the airborne blue square and use the red and yellow squares to guide it into the right position.It got more interesting towards the end but there’s only 40 levels, so if you want a real challenge this game doesn’t provide it, in that way LYNE is better, and is a real puzzle game. With this one the devs did probably just make it with the intention of people buying it to use on their profile showcase, and they succeeded.There’s no real settings options, so you can’t change the resolution manually and choose full screen mode or windowed mode, in the game you can go into a mini setting option and turn the music off, but that’s it.Also they coulda used a better sound effect for when the red squares explode, I hope this review helps the 10% of you who actually want to play it."

,Recommended,533300,28122593,"Posted: 1 December, 2016",all,Sweep,"About Zup!ZUP! is a physics-based puzzler that, while incredibly short, is oddly satisfying as well. Your task is to remove any and all obstacles that prevent the blue block in each stage to rest securely on the green platform below. Doing so will award you access to the next level. The game sounds simple enough and it is relatively so, even throughout the 40+ levels it has to play through. While that may seem like a significant amount of levels to keep you busy, you’ll find yourself breezing through them quickly.The charm that encapsulates ZUP!, in my opinion, is that it isn’t frustrating. Sure, the difficulty could be increased dramatically to better challenge the participant, but I didn’t mind as I sat down and exploded blocks across the screen; I found something this simple to just be, well, fun, regardless if I completed the level or really progressed at all. The handful of levels I kept failing miserably at still had me smiling, even after watching myself fail again and again.It is important to say, however, that ZUP! is painfully short, despite boasting well over 100 achievements. The main issue I had with ZUP! is that by the time I became fully engaged in it, the game was over. I prefer a meticulous approach to games, scouring every inch and trying everything I can. However, with just a mere 23 minutes of gameplay I was done; I had completed everything there was to do. I felt cheated, teased with a marvelous, yet simplistic idea. Even now, I feel as if I’m floundering as to say anything else about the game. There’s just not much substance to it.On a final note, as mentioned earlier, ZUP! does come with practical and useful achievements for those looking to dress up their Steam profile. While this shouldn’t be a positive to the game itself, I suppose one could consider it a consolation prize in the end.All in AllZup!is a very nice Puzzle Game!10/10 From MeSweep"

However, this game proved to be more than that.Zup! is unexpectedly addicting. Each level offers a new type of challenge. Even though it's quite simple, it keeps you yearning for more. It offers a unique physics puzzle to solve for each level. All you need to do is click and hope the box falls in the right place. Usually, trial and error is frustrating but in this game, it is surprisingly enjoyable. Since this game is fairly short, it is very lightweight (you can run it on almost any system), and priced at nearly free.TL;DRI highly recommend this to everyone.

The gameplay itself is decent, entertaining enough so that farming my achievements wasn't a chore.But the real power in this game comes from... well, everything outside the game.The achievements are great, you get every letter of the alphabet, in 2 colors each, for more customizing options for your profile.

Why? Because it's pure fun for the half hour it'll take you to finish the game. You need to get a blue cube to a green platform. You accomplish this by clicking on one or more red cubes that explode and send the blue and yellow cubes flying in the air. Sometimes a sequence of a few timed jumps is needed to get the blue cube to its target, but it's never a frustrating experience. It's just giggly fun. The game makes use of the Steam Achievements to add some more giggles by throwing an achievement your way for about anything you do in the game. You will easily get 118/118 achievements in half an hour. Seriously, if you want a cheap half hour of pure innocent fun, pick upZup!when it's on sale.I will add to this review that there are sequels toZup!. InZup!2, the only difference is that the blue cube has become a ball, which adds a bit more interesting physics. But they take the achievements joke a bit too far in the second game: you simply get 3 achievements for anything you do. In the first game, you get an achievement for starting a level and for ending a level -haha- but in the second game you just get three achievements for each level and for each and every action that yields an achievement. Then there isZup!3which has over 1000 achievements!Zup!2is already taking it too far, so that's just over the top. It's only for people who want to artificially increase their number of completed Steam Achievements, but not for anyone else. So just leave it at the first Zup!-game and give the others a miss."

The only points of interaction are clicking on the red explosive blocks(and grey squares in the DLC)so not much time is needed to figure out the solution.The game is amusing for its large number of achievements (118) that are unlocked for trivial actions; for example, starting a level grants an achievement, while clearing it gives another. This can be an incentive for achievement hunters looking to boost their achievement count and game completion rate, and the designs (letters, numbers and basic punctuation) are useful for decorating profiles while keeping a homogenoeus theme.Gameplay, however, is minimal; some coloured blocks are introduced in the later levels with new mechanics, but they do not affect the level much, and the objective remains the same. The game can also be completed in under 30 minutes which may be a deterrent for those looking to maximise their gaming dollars, but at least the low price means it is accessible to almost anyone.Ultimately, (a big) part of the value lies in the achievements, so if that is what you are looking for, pick this game up, set aside a few minutes and enjoy some demolitions along the way."

,Recommended,533300,29468616,Posted: 24 January,all,JacquesLeSauve,"Zup! is a 2D, block-based physics puzzler where the aim is to manoeuvre a blue block among stacks of other blocks and guide it safely onto a green platform for a certain length of time, which will open a gate and allow you to pass onto the next stage.Blocks come in different varieties and have different properties - yellows ones are loose and can be knocked around freely, but purple ones are fixed in space, while green ones move in set patterns until touched where they then become locked in place. But it's the red ones that really do most of the work, as these are explosive and will be your main method for moving your target blue block around the stage.There's obviously a trial and error aspect to the game, but the quick restarts (which are automatic if the blue block falls into oblivion, or manual at any point with the R key if you prefer) make things pretty quick and painless, so you'll never have any trouble with it for too long before making progress.Everything looks adequate without being spectacular and is more or less what you'd expect for a game of its price. Audio is kinda meh as the ambient music is incredibly low and barely audible while explosions are almost overwhelming in comparison. I think I muted the game by the second or third of its forty-something stages. Speaking of which, there are an additional twenty available as free DLC which will extend the challenge and add maybe ten or fifteen minutes to the original twenty-ish minute experience.Generally, the puzzles ranged from easy, one-time attempt stages that were largely forgettable, to slightly trickier ones that might require exact timing or have to be done in two or three phases rather than the one-shot deals of the starter levels. I personally found these much more fun and satisfying to figure out and complete and kind of wanted more by the time I'd finished with them.While there's argument to be made about the value of this game - as I've no doubt there's likely similar free browser games available that'll do the job just as well - whichever way you cut it, it's still fairly cheap and I enjoyed my brief time with it. It's an entirely non-essential distraction that ends just as it's getting started, but I still had fun and found little to complain about."

Perfect for your AGC% on Steam.Zup!is a simply 2D physics-based puzzle game about placing your box on a green surface to open a door.  It's pretty simple and should be finished in approximately 15-20 minutes...which does admitably harm the cost of the game, but with card drops that you can sell, you can make back about 20 cents on the title.yI found this game to be pretty fun and is still entertaining after completion though the replayability is relatively low.  As you can imagine, I would (and did) purchase this game on sale (which this game seems to do at a 10% discount).  Personally, the value of this game seems to be between 30-75 cents given what you're getting.8/10  A fun, short experience that rains achievements down on you gloriously for your success."

Interesting concept, but the puzzles are bland & repetitive.Zup!failed to hold my interest for long as I rapidly click through another level every few seconds hoping for more interesting challenges, only to find you have already completed the game!Even taking into consideration the low price,Zup!still doesn't offer great value in the length, challenge or replayability department. Perhaps the most you may get from this game is an easy perfect game and some rapid-fire achievements to boost your Steam Profile stats.Like I said at the start, I do think the game has an interesting concept, potentially good mechanics which is core to any good puzzle game. It is simple and who doesn't like to see things blow up :), but level designs could do with some polish & expansion. Would be great to see a level editor & workshop support. That could go a long way to offer harder challenges designed by the community & offer greater replayability, but in its current state it doesn't get my recommendation."

,Not Recommended,533300,29151253,Posted: 9 January,all,Seren,"Note: This review applies to both Zup! and Zup! 2These are to my knowledge, very original puzzle games. What little there is in terms of graphics and physics is very well done. There are many things, however, that prevent me from recommending them:- Length and Lack of Content: 20 minutes each, if you work quickly, like I did. My time played on the second one is higher because I left the game on while I went out to do an errand. The music is just a few bars that loop over and over again. Perhaps there's something in the background that I'm not hearing, but it's so quiet that it doesn't make much difference. The music doesn't go anywhere.- Ease: There is in theory some strategy involved, but you can win most levels in a few tries by just randomly clicking. I managed to beat the final level of Zup! 2 on my first try, with only one mouse click. Perhaps this was intended as a grand explosion finale, but most other levels were like this, too.- Broken Puzzles: On many levels, you can win by skipping large portions of the level. In many cases, there are many ways to solve each level. I don't mean that in a fun ""alternate solutions"" kind of way. I mean that randomly clicking will often beat the puzzle on the first try.- No Replayability: Some games offer much less than this in terms of content, but are fun games that I would highly recommend. Tetris, for example, has much less content than this game, but is highly replayable. After you've beaten this game once, there's no point playing it again until enough time has passed that you've forgotten all the solutions (not that it would be that hard to figure them out again, anyway).- Achievement Spam: If you're looking for achievements, this game has them. Many of the positive reviews for this game cite achievements as a key feature. I earned six within my first sixty seconds. That's one every ten seconds. I got both games to 100% completion in the short time that I spend playing them. To be clear, I earned over 200 achievements in about 40 minutes. I had to replay one of the levels, since it didn't register the achievement for that level the first time. It only took me about ten seconds to replay it, though.- Better Options for the Money: For the same price, you can get a full-length pixel art RPG by some random indie developer. Generic? Sure. But you could actually have fun playing a game for hours on end. There are so many really good games out there for the same price, or even less. For such a low price, I don't feel ripped off by the developer, and I wouldn't really mind if I couldn't get a refund. Seeing as I can, however, I think I'm going to get something else.Overall, I think the concept shows enormous potential, but you won't find any of it in these actually existing games. I hope the developer refines the concept in the future, and makes a more challenging and engaging game."

I wouldn't say it is super easy but it is obtainable to get all of them. Some levels take a bit of quick clicking. I found this game to be fun and tough at others. The block you must move to the green zone is square while the second game it is round. There is a lot of achievements and it is easier than say Lowglow, Three Digits, and Cross Set.

If you love achievements, this game gives you plenly of them. You get 3 achievements for each relitivly normal thing you do, for example, right clicking. Thats right. You get an achievement for right clicking. The games consept is relitivly good, even though it is not implimented well. Zup 2 does a much better job in this aspect.

It is a game of trial and error and basic physics that is extremely short and far too rewarding; however for such a respectable price, it can provide a good half hour of entertainment.Most of the 50-odd levels in the game are fairly routine and there isn't really a gradual difficulty increase until the latter levels. You will fly through the game with achievements raining down and only towards the end does this game begin to shine as a very intriguing concept that just plays it too safe early on and for the majority.With 118 achievements that all can be earned within 30 minutes as you sail to completion; this aspect alone will interest many users probably more than the game itself. Zup! is an excellent idea that just needs a bit more depth, challenge and better level design.If you have a few spare pennies or want to give your Steam achievement counter an easy boost; this game is ideal. Beyond the easy achievements, length and lack of difficulty; Zup! could have been ingenious but instead is far too generous. A sequel that focuses on complexity instead of generosity would be highly welcome but depsite the shortcomings here; it's hard not to recommend the game for the price and achievements alone."

The concept is simple and the levels are fun enough. The main challanges are clicking on the right blocks and timing. Some of the levels feel cheap because of the first reason as the way to solve the level is to click on the right one of the 4 blocks. You'll beat the game in 20 minutes so it's probably worth a dollar but I feel like the concept could have gone a lot further.¯\_(ツ)_/¯

76561197998690550,Recommended,533300,32725271,Posted: 24 June,all,LaowaiGamer,"ZUP! is a little 2D physics puzzle game series that would be totally unnoticeable among peers, has it not been for the infamously ridiculous amount of achievements it has.But let’s start from the beginning. Gameplay is as simple as it gets. You have some squares that either stay, move, represent “you”, represent place “you” need to get, and – hence the title – explode. Essentially, picking up right thing to explode is the main way to solve puzzles in this game. And since the number of possible items to blow up rarely exceeds a dozen – you will hardly get stuck on any particular level for more than a minute.Note, that with puzzles that simplistic, the mental reward, the proud feeling of “I did it” will be passing at best. If saying “I solved all puzzles in Braid without looking up hints” will probably raise some friends’ eyebrows in well-deserved awe, saying the same about “Zup!” will keep those eyebrows in question as still as the level of your IQ after playing this game.Having said that – I don’t mean to say that the game is bad. It can still provide quality entertainment for dull moments in life, like, when you stuck in the airport for an hour, or sitting through stakeholders meeting – anything that would otherwise be filled with endless crushing of candies.Now, elephant in the room: achievements. Game developers apparently saw the excitement the puzzles produced in players, or rather, the lack thereof – and found a skillful way to compensate it. Or, should I say, overcompensate – since “Zup” series is now responsible for about 98% of all the achievements I got, and even future years of gaming would hardly bring this number to anything lower than 90%.Is it good, having thousands “free” achievements? I don’t know. It is definitely not for everybody. Having that many achievements has its “oh you played THAT game” vibe about it. But here the solution is simple – just stop caring what other people think. And after playing ZUP! you’ll have all letters you need to reflect this in your achievement showcase."

What i'm saying is that for the content and genre it might as well be free.In conclusion, I understand that it is avery cheap game and majority of Steam users purchase this game solely for the purpose of displaying the achievements on their profile.

Not once in a game I have ever played have there been ""Achievement Unlocked!"" showing up from start to finish. Seriously. This game floods your bottom right corner of your screen until you complete the game.SCREW LYNE. GET THIS.We all know why you're here, you want to be able to spell things out in your profile showcases. Well, this game's got you covered. In addition to having every single letter, each letter has an alternate background for each achievment (look at the achievements to see what I mean) which fits better for some people's profiles. In addition to that, Zup also has symbols. Lyne does not.Good:- You can beat the game in 16 minutes without knowing what you're doing the first time.- Calming music.- Not impossible to get 100% achievements like most other puzzle games.- You can get the achievements without getting bored of the gameplay (unlike LYNE).- The only thing you need to beat this game is a simple click of a mouse.- This game is better than Lyne because unlike Lyne, this game gives a letter achievement for each level rather than each ""world"". In Lyne, you have to complete 26 levels for each letter achievement. This game, only one level. With that being said...Bad:- I mean, I guess it's too short? But in reality, blame the english language for not having enough letters and symbols lol.8/10 I guess? I mean, it's a straight upgrade from Lyne in terms of letter achievements, but if we look past that, you have a game who is calming with simplistic gameplay and graphics. I don't really see myself coming back to this game, but it is probably something memorable at least."

It took me about 25 minutes to 100% the game without rushing.Gameplay is really basic, you click on some red squares to cause explosions and you need to save a single blue square from falling off the screen. Not only that, but you need to land the blue square directly on a green patch or you fail and need to retry (this is not explain in game and it is annoying the first time the blue square land on a yellow square and you need to go in the options to manually reset the stage). It seems more like a free Flash distraction than a real game. Don't be fooled by the achievements hunters; it's very lackluster even for a dollar.TLDR: Too easy and too short even for less than a dollar."

Менюшка для мобильных, около 40 уровней, квадратные блоки разных цветов, имеющие разную роль:Синий - главный блок, от которого зависит прохождение уровня. Ни в коем случае не ронять в пустое пространство.Желтые - обычные, существующие для интерактивности после нажатия на красный.Красные - взрывающиеся, приводящие все на уровне в движение.Фиолетовые - обычные, намертво твердые, существуют ""просто потому что"".Зеленые - движущиеся, пока не прикоснешься к ним, после чего становятся как фиолетовые - намертво твердые.Ещё на виду у нас ""дверь"", по которой понятно, прошли мы уровень или нет, и шестиугольные ""облака"". ... Ощущение, что последние не просто так висят в воздухе.В чем же задача это минималистичной игры? Честно скажу, я не сразу понял. Сначала я думал, надо взрывать блоки так, чтобы на поле остался только Синий блок, ничего лишнего. Как потом выяснилось, на деле все ещё проще: надо просто добиться, чтобы Синий блок упал на поле.Когда понимаешь механику игры, а она тут такая же минималистическая, как и музыкальное сопровождение, понимаешь суть игры, а потом видишь, что у тебя ачивки пулеметной очередью выбиваются, ты начинаешь подозревать, что игра какая-то слишком простая. Однако на удивление, наверное зависит от характера самого игрока, игра не надоедает вовсе. Её можно использовать как расслабляющую нервы после работы/учебы/ссоры, и возможно это даже действительно поможет.Плюсы:- Минимализм во всем: графика, музыка, механика.- Взрывать блоки не надоедает, ибо полет все время разный.- Годиться для перерыва на чашечку чая.Минусы:- Разнообразие уровней начинаются слишком поздно.- Очень маленькая продолжительность и малое количество уровней.Оценку не буду ставить. Не потому что это мусор, а потому что мне на эти циферки пофиг. Тем более на такую игру.Единственное, скажу. Есть подозрение, что у игры есть сюжет. Это как минимум говорят некоторые ачивки....................................................................................Not every time I see a game that will go to 100%, do not blink of an eye, and a sense of dissatisfaction - no.This is a review on the minimalist game Zup !, where the main part of the game - the explosions.What we have here. Mobile menus, levels of about 40, square blocks of different colors having different roles:Blue - the main unit, which depends on the level of the passage. In no case do not drop into the empty space.Yellow - the usual, existing for interactivity after clicking on the red.Red - exploding by pressing a single click.Purple - the usual, tightly solid, there are ""just because.""Green - moving until it will touch them, and then become like violet - tightly solid.More we see a ""door"" through which is understandable, we have passed level or not, and hexagonal ""clouds"". ... The feeling that the past is not just hang in the air.What is the task of this minimalist game? Honestly, I did not realize. At first I thought it is necessary to blow up blocks, so that on the field there was only a blue box and nothing else. As it turned out, all the more simpler: you just have contrive to the blue block down on the pitch.When you understand the mechanics of the game, and it is here the same minimalist, like music, you understand the essence of the game, and then you see that you achievements machine-gun fire knocked out, you start to suspect that some sort of a game is too simple. However, surprisingly, probably depends on the character of the player, the game is not boring at all. It can be used to relaxing your nerves after work / study / altercation, and maybe it's even really help.Pros:- Minimalism in everything: graphics, music, mechanics.- Blasting units do not get bored, because the flight is always different.- Fit for a break for a cup of tea.Minuses:- Variety of levels begin too late.- A very small duration and low levels.Assessment will not put. Not because the trash, but because I do not care for these numbers. Especially on this game.The only thing I will say. There is a suspicion that the game has a story. This is at least say some achievements."

This isn't a puzzle game, it's an achievement farm.Almost every 'puzzle' in this game relies on either a bit of luck due to occasionally wonky physics, or is simply clicking squares in the right order without any real thought. Many of the levels are of the 'rollercoaster' variety where you simply click whatever's closest to the blue cube to propel it through a tunnel to the end.This coupled with the sequels the developer is insistient on pumping out with even more and more achievements per installment makes me wish I could remove the game from my account's history."

First, let's get the positives out of the way:-Wonderful, soothing music-Simple, yet good graphics-Interesting physics puzzles-Easy achievementsAll of this comes together to create what should be a nice, simple puzzle game.  After all, what's not to like here?  Well, in the end, it all comes down to the gameplay, and that is where Zup! just doesn't succeed.  This is primarily because simple and interesting doesn't necessarily mean good, and while I could see Zup's game mechanics possibly working, it doesn't work here, and it's all because of one thing: I'm just guessing.  Nothing about Zup! felt rewarding, and in something like a puzzle game, it's incredibly important that I feel accomplished after beating a tough level.  If you didn't see the trailer, Zup! bases its game mechanics around blowing up red blocks to propel your tiny blue square into a green zone, allowing you to advance.  However, I never felt as if I used logic or reasoning to solve the puzzles in the game; I just clicked red squares until I got something that worked.  After beating a game, you should feel like you were better at the game than when you started, and I can't say I improved at the game whatsoever from the first level to the last level.  Tack on the fact that I could complete this game in just 17 minutes, and you have an unrewarding game that you can complete in little to no time, the likes of which I cannot recommend.FINAL SCORE: 4/10"

Some of the later levels are moderately tough, but not because they are a puzzle but due to the fact that you have to time your clicks so perfectly.  All in all, only buy if it's on sale and you want easy achievements."

There are only about 45 puzzles(excluding free DLC), most of which can be solved on the first try. Along with this, there are only so many options so the only puzzles that could take you longer than a minute are the last few timed ones.Rate: 4/10 Again, it's an okay game there's just not much to it.

Therefore, I will be literally copy/pasting this across all of my reviews.Many people call these games out, citing that they're card farming games. While this may or may not be true, these games have some very good puzzles. Sure, they're short, but I feel that the price I paid for them is well worth it (Less than a dollar for each game in the summer sale?!). Some of the puzzles are really well thought out and it feels good to complete a game like this. So here's the pros and cons.Pros:-Good music, never found myself reaching for the mute button. The music IS on a loop, but it's comparable to Hexcells' music, so if you enjoyed that game's music, you'll enjoy their music as well.-Well designed puzzles, especially in 4 and Zero.Could be a pro or a con:-A ton of achievements. If you don't want to artificially inflate your achievement count, don't play any of these passed 1 and 2. If you don't care or you in fact do want to do that, go ahead and play all of them-Feels like one of those games you would love to play on Flash sites like Newgrounds or KongregateCons:-Short, but enjoyable. You could actually ♥♥♥♥ the dev(s?) out of money by getting 100% achievements in less than the 2 hour refund periodOverall, I enjoyed these games enough to recommend them all."

And I'd be lying if I said this game is perfect, but I have to give praise where praise is due. This game really surprised me!The very first distinction I'd like to make between this and Super Duper Flying Genocide 2017 is that unlike that dissappointment, I would actually consider this a game and a rather enjoyable and intuitive one at that! It is clear that Zup! goes for the same demographic; achievement hunters, completionists, whatever you want to call them. I consider myself part of that group, so I felt inclined to give this game a try despite my rather low expectations. Very much like the building blocks that you interact with in Zup! my expectations were blown away! This is definitely a puzzle game first and foremost, and an achievement treasure second.Your objective is to bring the blue square onto the green tiles through the use of explosions. The red squares are explosive and clicking them will make them blow up, knocking any yellow and blue squares away in the process. It really is as simple as that. But just because the mechanics are simple it doesn't necessarely mean that the game itself is easy, in fact I'd say far from it.The levels start out easy enough, and for the first few levels it feels like this might have actually been a bad choice after all, just another cash grab copy paste job with loads of achievements attached, but then you reach level 10 and things start to get interesting. As you progress through the game each level becomes more and more challenging and you need to both think of the right solution and make use of your reflexes and predictions to launch the blue square with the right trajectory and force to get it where it needs to be.Soon I had forgotten about my prior pessimism and was instead joyfully exploring in how many ways I could try to knock the yellow block-towers down and with what sort of speed I could send the blue square flying in order to solve the puzzle in front of me. The simple yet addictive nature of the game had caught me entirely off guard and I was getting more and more intrigued and hopeful for the next challenge the game would provide me with...And then it ended. Just like that.If anything, that would be my only real gripe with the title, it is extremely short. I beat the whole thing with 100% achivements in only a couple of minutes, and I wish it would go on for a bit longer as I was actually having quite a bit of fun with it. But to be fair the game has a very low price point and the tags do describe it as ""short"" so I should have been expecting it to end rather quickly.All that said, I hope you understand my thoughts about this game but in case I was too lengthy in my description of it and the enjoyment it gave me let me try to sum it up in a few short words:This is a short but fun and intuitive physics puzzle game. I had a lot of fun with it and the achievements are a bonus rather than the main focus. I recommend this highly if you want some quick fun, and I suggest you pick up the Zup-Zup! Bundle which hosts all three games for a very affordable price. I have not yet played the other two titles, but if they are anywhere as good as this then I cannot recommend it enough.Enjoy!"

The blue block is the one that you have to care about. You will complete a level if the blue block has touched the green square at the bottom.You will not complete the level if the blue block is still standing on another block or is blown away out of the level.You can destroy the blocks with an explosion by clicking on a red block.Easy achievements.Game is short.Game is too casual and doesn't provide alot of challenge.Has a repeat button.You will always win. If one red block didnt do it. Then click on the next one instead.You can complete this game within 30-45 mins.Other things.You have to click on the ""Door"" after you have finished the level.

It's very short, and I've been able to complete the entire game, every level and every achievement, in under half an hour.

The last 3 versions of Zup I am stuck on certain levels but I'll randomly try them again after a short break and progress a level or two. If what you want is difficulty then the last 3 games is what i recommend. But overall, the series is worth the money and is a great addition to your steam library.They do flood you with achievements but I ignore those and I dont care if each game temporarily boosts my achievements by a few hundred.Lastly, for what each game is priced, it would be dumb to not try at least one of the games, I mean, a taco at taco bell now costs more than one of these games. It's worth a try even if you beat it in 20 minutes. When looking at it through the scope of what it really is, it is a good buy and has replayability to it."
