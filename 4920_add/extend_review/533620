Has social media warped peoples minds so horribly that this is now acceptable? This is everything that is wrong in videogames. I can't even be upset at Valve, Greenlight is a trap for crap but it is literally a loud flashy meme inspired lazy attempt at being humerous just for a shameless cash grab. This is a game, published and ""Developed"" as artistic design? I think not.Gaming used to mean something, but when a generation of underdeveloped kids raised on social media nose deep in a cellphone cant seperate message boards and youtube poop from anything else in life, do they even know any better?But memes guys. It has 1 achievement for loading the game up. Supports badges but seeing how♥♥♥♥♥♥lazy this ""title"" is Id expect the extra shill. The insult to humanity known as the developers of this knew they wouldnt be getting much out of it. It is also mostly in broken english and russian. Of course it is."

But hay if your an achievement hunter you can get 100% achieved on this game with no problems. And also it grants 4/7 cards. Get this for 90% off then burn it...

,Recommended,533620,28777225,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,Major7_BR,"There are interesting aspects to this game. Positive ones include soundtrack and visual experience as a whole. Things that require reworking are the (so unclear) hitboxes, music that shouldn't rewind as you hit R to replay and it should provide some more info on what's to be done in each game mode. It may be exaggerated, absurd, maybe coarse and clumsy, but such polishments are welcome and necessary for the game to be enjoyable.Positive rating in hopes for the future.Originally reviewed in Dec 29th, 2016."

If you want a game, don't buy this, seriously.But hey, easy achievements and cards (also has at least one cool profile background).If you buy it when it's on sale, it pretty much pays itself back in cards."

I still remember that because it was such a close call. Having such practical, hands-on experience, I can authoritatively say that Starushko Lub isnotthe real deal.Also the math minigame isn't working."
