I like it a lot for time killing game or making a break.The only negative point is that you must buy in game upgrades with real money even if you want to won first levels. But it has many offers.. I paid only 0.89 $ (real money) for Full tesla weapons and I got 110.000$ in game money free.. That's a lot for only 0.89$ real money.. So now I enjoy the best tower def game I have played :D

It's pretty much the sort of game you have nothing to lose on. Don't expect to get invested or incredibly involved though. Some micromanagement on certain levels with certain classes but eh, nothing too painstaking. It's good clean fun that you can sit back and watch while you eat some popcorn.

,Not Recommended,533780,30091510,Posted: 21 February,all,sirholo,"The game is Pay-to-Play AND Pay-to-Win.  Upon first launch, the player is immediately assaulted with pleas to ""buy"" upgrades or cash (which can buy most upgrades).  The 'Hero' characters, however, are ONLY obtainable through a cash-for-content purchase.  There is literally no other way to obtain the hero characters.As for the game itself, it started off challenging and interesting enough.  It never went anywhere from there.  There are VERY FEW actual maps, and levels one encounters along the way are only slight map-alterations of the 5 or 6 prototype maps of the game.This things feels to me like someone's semester project in computer game design.  One that they put on Steam to monetize.THIS IS NOT A FREE TO PLAY GAME.  It should be removed from Steam."

76561198228044600,Recommended,533780,30236753,Posted: 28 February,all,Trip,"This game is awesome. It's free so obviously the developer invented ways to make a little money from the game in the form of an in game store. This is a great quality tower defense game that I truly enjoy playing casually. I have not spent any money as of yet, but when I reach a stage that I can no longer grind to a win then I will certainly considder supporting the developer. To all the people that are complaining its pay to win would you please considder the effort that goes into making a game? These guys deserve your support. They could have sold the game, but decided to go another route and let you play a large portion for free. In my humble opinion, this game kicks the crud out of most full priced TD games that I have played. There are simply so much to upgrade and when you replay a stage with the upgrades you really feel more powerful. So stop the negatives vibes and just enjoy the game for what it is."

You just have to deploy your front line with various firearms, make your men stronger by promoting them and watch the wave of zombies bleeding, blowing up or flatten.Pros:+ totally free+ tons of levels+ huge amount of upgrades+ small amount of space needed on hard driveCons:- basic graphics- no music during the massacre- no multiplayer availableAbsolutely recommended."
,Recommended,533780,30069612,Posted: 20 February,all,Shadeball,"Zombie defense is a fun little game that is easy to pick up and put down. It's not tactical in the least but works fine as a zombie-themed tower defense game. It was worth the download for me and whil it has microtransactions, they don't feel at all necessary to proceed. I guess they could decrease some grindy elements but I never really felt an impulse to try any of them out."
