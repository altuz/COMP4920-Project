You can't fake them out.Player movement is limited to set way-points. I didn't expect that. I thought I could move around and find MY best spot. Nope.  This movement limitation was the deal breaker for me as I thought I would be able to move freely. You can't.The aim of the guns was not intuitive. And I set it up to where I could look right over my controller(you can do this in the game). Adding a gun practice level would be good. To get a feel for the aim of your virtual gun.I just didn't like this. It's early access I know and I went with the reviews. Sorry, I got frustated with the enemies predidcting my tactics and I also felt restricted because of the set way-point movement. After about 5 or 6 plays and knew this was not for me.Just my opinion. Peace."

I wont the possibility to move everywhere I wont... I feel these need mostly in the second map (hotel)Now in the game we have only 3 weapons: a pistol, a submachine gun and the ak47, for these last one, is interesting how you can use two hands to control that (one hand for the trigger and the other hand to grip and aim a target).The graphic style is like a modern version of virtua cop (old sega game), this is good or bad is personalPro:- cool concept- ambient destruction- immersive combatCounter:- bad sound of the weapons- the music is not particularly ispired- locomotion system- only 3 weapon (we wont more weapon like shotgun and others...- two maps only (and one is unfinished)- when you shot, the feedback to the controls is light- when you get damage, at a certain point you can't see pratically nothing onto the screen- no story- no interaction like open or close doors, or find weapon and bullets (the bullet now are unlimited)- no reward- not extremelly longevyI hope to see in the future many update for these game"

It plays a lot like arcade 'light gun' games such as Time Crisis, but with a twist: You choose when you move to the next location! The map has several pre-made destinations for you to pick and dash to, going from one spot to the next as enemies gradually destroy the cover you're using.Fortunately, you get to shoot back. It's thrilling to dash behind a pillar, lean out to unload your twin revolvers (or other guns; the dev is adding more as time goes on it seems) at generic action movie enemies, pop back to safety to reload, then lean out the other side of the pillar to get the guy trying to flank you. It's a heck of a workout, and some cover is low enough that you'll have to crouch in real life to be properly protected by it!My only marks against the game are that bullet time is a bit clumsily implemented, which distracts me during gunfights (however, the dev seems to have plans to let you adjust how it works)... and the relatively low amount of content at this time: Just one completed stage plus another that is in ongoing development.It's still one of my favorite VR games at this time and I felt it was worth the $12. If he makes good on plans to adjust the game and add more content, it will be even easier to justify the purchase!"

I'm really enjoying the game so far and can see myself putting a lot of hours into it. Really makes you feel like you are the hero in an over the top action movie.Please know that the below feedback is not criticizing the game but rather my own personal opinion about the mechanics and such. The game is still very fun and well worth the current price point.Feedback:GUNS/GUN PLAY -•	Would really suggest incorporating optics onto existing weapons as well as future weapons, specifically reflex sights or taller iron sights. I believe this would allow for easier, and more natural feeling to aiming. The lower sights on the current weapons feel like you have to be very precise when lining up the rear to the front sight. For a slower paced game this would be fine, but I find myself doing more of a spray and pray to keep out of the line of fire.•	Muzzle flash is very big and really interferes with aiming when trying to use the weapon sights (especially the UMP). As I mentioned above, this leads to spray and pray more often than not.•	Suggest removing the two handed feature with the AK and treat it as a single controller weapon. Rather than the gun twitching around when the player moves their off hand.•	SIDE NOTE: THE REVOLVERS CURRENTLY SHOW THEIR BULLETS TRAVELLING WHERE YOU AIM AND THE EXACT OPPOSITE DIRECTION TOWARDS THE REAR. IF YOU FIRE THE GUN WHILE LOOKING FROM THE SIDE PROFILE, YOU CAN SEE TRACER LEAVE BOTH ENDS OF THE GUN. THIS MAKES AIMING DIFFICULT AS THE ANIMATION FLASHES RIGHT BACK AT THE PLAYERLOCOMOTION-•	Locomotion feels fine during travel, but once the animation stops, it can give a slight headache. Would maybe like to see teleportation to the designated cover points instead?CONFIRM KILLS-•	It would be nice to have some subtle animation confirming when you've killed an enemy.LEVEL DESIGN-•	Implement more standing cover points, rather than so much crouching.DIFICULTY SETTINGS-•	My preference was to use the hardest setting and eliminate bullet time. When it is being automatically activated for every bullet that travels in the players general direction it can become annoying. Maybe allow for the user to manually activate bullet time?"

Tried to put my hand on a wall the look around the corner to shoot and luckily didn't fall head first into my tv. Also briefly tried to put my gun on a nearby desk and luckily my controller landed on some thick carpet. The movement can be a little weird, but I like being able to switch positions and take cover. Some of the cover being destructible is a nice touch, the mall level is especially good at that with the stuff on the shelves. I like the weapons so far too, especially having both akimbo and one handed weapons. I'd love some more though, shotgun and semi-auto pistols maybe. It's also pretty tough, getting trough a level on medium is a challenge for me. Playing with the revolvers is tough too, I switch it down to easy to have fun with those. I can so vividly remember being in the hotel parking lot shooting out of the front office door holding it open with one revolver while I shot at people with the other... very good game."

Shooting with the rifle held in both hands feels solid and you can move in the Vive's large space from lying on the ground to jumping behind cover. This has the makings of a great game if the developers fix the terrible motion and controls.The ""Bullet Time"" feels horrible...it is indistinguishable from VR hitching. I thought it was a bug at first! Turn this off immediately.Moving between the fixed positions that you're allowed to inhabit is instantly nauseating. The locomotion should be replaced with one of the methods that works well in other games: teleportation (the best), arm swinging, or limited field of view during motion.The thumb controls are terrible. I kept accidentally switching guns while trying to move to the next position.The gun barrels are at the wrong angle for the Vive, which makes aiming feel awkward, especially with the dual-wielding setups. Given that there is already an in-game control for tilting the barrels, this is easy to fix: just allow that control to go all of the way to 90 degrees.There are a few ""normal"" bugs that are irritating but not game breaking/sickening like the above ones. Sometimes dead bodies float in the air, sometimes enemies are missing textures, and animations can glitch every now and then.I look forward to a future update that resolves these basic problems so that I can recommend the game."

The game has a classic arcade feel and I like the physics of everything falling apart as the bullets fly.That said, there NEEDS to be other options for locomotion.  There is no way that being choppily dragged around in different directions without any control will not make a huge number of players ill.  I did not see changes to locomotion at all in the developer's roadmap, and I think that's a huge mistake.  Creating a comfortable experience should be the top priority."

Obviously more levels and weapons are needed, plus some enemy variety, but that's a given. I think the smoke and muzzle flash effects from the guns needs to be seriously toned down - you can't see anything while shooting and it's simply not realistic. The motion system was why I bought this, to see if it worked without making me sick. The fact is, your brain doesn't like to experience your body moving when it can't explain it and this game is no different. The only saving grace is that you don't really need to move much at all and when you do its just for a couple of seconds, then stop and shoot for a few minutes. Facing the direction you are moving, and kneeling on the ground when you do, are ways to minimise the motion sickness feeling.Sound needs work as there are so few sounds that bullets sound like they react the same across most materials. Also needs more detail in terms of environment destruction and reaction to bullets.Overall, it's worth the price provided pretty big updates keep coming reasonably fast. Id have given it a neutral verdict if there was an option but it doesn't deserve a thumbs down."
