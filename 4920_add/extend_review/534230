,Recommended,534230,26043408,"Posted: 15 October, 2016",all,Alyx Sokarad,"TL/DR: Quell 4D is a yes from me.If you are a fan of Doom/Duke Nukem style shoot-em-up games, you will love this.PROS:- The art style is very retro. No highres textures here!- The game looks nice and crisp. It runs smoooooth as butter.- Sound/Music are awesome. A throwback to the 80's and 90's style. Nice touch.- The shotgun. I love this effing weapon. It feels/sounds meaty and does what it’s supposed to do.CONS:- Movement system needs to be worked on. My arm got tired pretty quickly. Having to hold your arm out for extended periods of time can tire some people out.Final words:With a few tweaks, this game could be an instant classic. You won’t regret this purchase.Overall 9/10EDIT (10/18): I removed a con. The developer quickly fixed the sight issues and now my shots are landing cleanly! Thanks!"

Quell 4D might just be the first fully released (non wave) fps on the Vive.The simple colourful graphics work surprisingly well, giving the game a very distinct style that works together with the music and sound effects to pull you into this surreal world.The gameplay is very reminiscint of Doom or Wolfenstein 3D, with a heavy emphasis on moving and dodging over taking cover during combat. The levels are also rather complex, often seeming much larger than they are with clever keycard placement and triggers making the most of the levels. And with the simple graphics as they are, there is a surprising variety in the levels.I do feel the game lost a lot of it's steam towards the end with levels getting longer and more complex, but without a checkpoint system, death becoming far more frustrating, and rage quits more common. The game is not perfect and perhaps this is the biggest issue it has. It aims to be a hardcore shooter like the FPS of yore, but what it seems to forget is that even though you could be killed in seconds towards the end of a level in Wolf3d, you could save whenever you wanted, so this was nowhere near as big an issue.With that said, I stuck through it, and I'm glad I did, it was fun, and so far one of the biggest must have's on Vive. I'm hoping the devs will get some sort of checkpoint or save system in place, it will make it just so much better."

This uses graphics very similar to Wolfenstein 3D or Doom, but with garish colors (actually pretty smart, it hides the fresnel lens artifacts that the vive is prone to), and it works.

Seriously I love this game as much as Superhot VR and this game seems criminally underrated.

After being flooded with half baked, incomplete VR ""experiences"" on the Vive, I was relieved to finally get a complete game with a good amount of consistently fun content. My excitement probably points to how badly we need fleshed out VR titles, as Quell is a basic, tried and true shooter at heart. That said, the guns feel great, locomotion works with very little disorientation, and the game was obviously crafted with love.Quell 4D is one of the best games on the Vive right now, with a few minor quibbles. I saw a few graphical glitches, and surprisingly (considering the simple graphics) the framerate stutters when many enemies on screen (although this is rare). The game also has a good amount of difficulty and no mid-level save points, which does mean that you'll find yourself retreading old ground as fast as possible before you reach the end. Arguably this is part of the game's charm since death feels meaningful, but this became old hat pretty quickly in the longer levels with many keycards.I will also say that I got the game after the weapons update, and I've found the guns to work great. It feels really satisfying to line up shots with the on-weapon sight, and hitting an exploding barrel with the pea-shooter from across the room always brings a smile to my face."

Thankfully though Rubycone wasn't one of them and put together a very retro FPS that plays like one of the classics you grew up with. It really feels like we're living through the video game eras all over again only vastly accelerated.Hopefully Quell 4D will do for VR what Doom 3D did for PC gaming.The characters and voice acting remind me of StarFox on the SNES. Ahh the golden days...Quell 4D manages to be both nostalgic and new at the same time. It's a perfect blend of concepts that worked then and introducing them to the tech of now. What we get is a great FPS title that proves we can have real games in VR.Thank you Rubycone. Honestly and sincerely, thank you.Carrot on a Stick Locomotion:This is a new one for me and it worked out pretty well. It's similar to onward style motion but you're pressing a trigger to lock you into moving the direction you're controller is pointing. The difference is that Onward doesn't lock you down to moving just where the controller is pointing. You can sidestep without turning the controller. Aside from that, the locomotion systems were very similar and like Onward it becomes very natural.Points taken off for not having locomotion options but overall it felt good.Definitely worth picking up Quell 4D. One of the few gems worth its price tag."

It makes you feel like being inside those classic FPS games like Wolfenstein 3D, Doom (the original one)...Locomotion system is weird and can be annoying at times (it gets stuck in wall easily) but it fits the funky thematic of the game. It takes time to get used to this system. Moreover, since your enemy moves slowly and most of them shoot like Stormtrooper, the slow and clunky locomotion system does not make the game too frustating. Once you are used to it, you will feel like a badass action hero, strafing, dodging bullets and blowing enemies' heads off.Weapons are varied and interesting. The machine gun has an unintuitive aiming angle which makes it useless.Level are well designed. Beyond level 1, it breaks away from the ""enter room, kill everyone"" formula and introduces well-known FPS trope such as avoiding sniper, shooting exploding barrels... However, due to the cartoonish aesthetic, all rooms and corridors look the same. It doesn't help that levels are branching and gated with keycards, expect to get lost or confused a few times.Overall, a solid singleplayer VR FPS. 7/10."

,Recommended,534230,26080441,"Posted: 16 October, 2016",all,dogtato,"Basically Wolfenstein 3D VR. It runs really smoothly and the gameplay is a lot of fun. You move by holding a carrot on a stick in front of a platform you're riding on. The further from the center of your playspace you hold it, the faster you go, so if you have a large area you can go pretty fast if you can handle it. Interestingly, this means you have to move back to the center to change direction, so if you charge in to a room, to retreat you'll have to actually retreat across your play space. If you're prone to motion sickness this is probably not the game for you.It's great to have actual levels to progress through and to be able to move through them freely. I can't overstate that, it stands in such stark contrast to all the stand in place and shoot endless waves games. The scientist sidekick is cool because he doesn't take damage and die on you.It would be nice if the pistol had a tracer effect like the enemy bullets, but it's not too hard to hit enemies without it. I had some issues with the interface initially, like accidentally unlocking the full map after playing two levels and then getting stuck on the final boss map, but I think the unlock has been removed and I haven't had any issues lately."

Only problem is the movement, I am prone to motion sickness when playing games like this and can't fully recommend it for this reason. It would be nice to see an update with a teleportation option."

My one complaint is that it has no multiplayer. =( I feel like this would be a GREAT multiplayer game. Chack out my Video Gameplay here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rft_rKrLRQk"

While the somewhat kooky storyline and characters make the game feel like it could be fun, I have a number of problems with the game.The biggest problem, and sadly the one that has me looking into getting a refund, is definitely the movement system.  There's only one movement style in the game, and that's constant movement by either holding one of the controls away from your body in the direction you want to move or using the thumbpad on the Vive controller, depending on how you have it toggled in game.  This works the same as if you were using an XBOX controller or a keyboard to move.  It doesn't necessarily sound like a bad thing, but you have to take into account that this is a room scale game where you're standing up and need to physically turn around and possibly move a few steps in any given direction to dodge out of the way of shots.  Trying to physically move about while your 3D self is sliding around can be a major issue.  I had several instances where I almost fell to the ground by accidentally taking a step to one side while I was moving with the thumbpad on the Vive, and I suddenly lost all of my balance as a result.  It can lead to near instant vertigo and also has the effect of causing nausea from motion sickness.  I'm not typically prone to motion sickness in VR and have had bouts of playing some VR games for several hours without a break and had no noticeable side effects from it aside from the lines on my face where the VR headset was.  With Quell 4D however, I found I was starting to get queasy around 10-15 minutes in.  I believe I managed to soldier through it for close to 35 minutes before I had to quit out of VR completely for the rest of the day due to the nausea sticking with me for a good 3-4+ hours afterward.  I really wish they'd figured out a way to put a teleport movement system into the game.My second problem is with the guns.  I've only managed to get 2 total in my play time, the starter pistol and a shotgun, so I don't have the entire arsenal to judge things by.  Both of these guns felt somewhat awkward to aim for me, like they're not really lining up properly with how the controller sits in your hand or something.  I can imagine if I played enough that I'd probably get used to it, but because of problem #1, that's not going to happen.  I also have to say that the shotgun felt oddly weak and is only really usable from at most a few feet away from an enemy.  Much farther out and you're just spraying bullets randomly around the room while causing hardly any damage.The last real problem I have is with the enemy death sprites.  I understand they're trying to go with that classic 90s FPS look and feel by having a sprite there for the corpse after you've killed an enemy off, but the problem comes in how it's executed.  When you look at the classics like Doom and Wolfenstein, after an enemy dies, their corpse sprite is laying down on the ground so it's maybe 1/3 to 1/4 of its original height.  Quell 4D just has the enemy flip onto its side with some slight gore added in.  While the first set of rat-fox enemies don't really cause much of a problem with this, when you start running into the elephant guys, you'll see where the problem comes in.  The elephant lays on its side and is blocking what amounts to a 6 foot by 6 foot area of your view.  Enemies can be behind this corpse and possibly shoot you.  It would be better if the corpses weren't taking up such a large block of viewable space.In spite of all of these problems, I do feel like this could be a very entertaining throw back FPS with a somewhat humorous story.  Playing it made me think a bit of some other 90s FPS's I played way back then, like Blake Stone.  Honestly, if it wasn't for the motion sickness-causing movement system, I'd still keep playing it.  As much as I'd like to support an indie dev making a VR title, I'm going to have to look into getting a refund instead, since throwing up in my mouth isn't really that much fun.  I'd consider repurchasing the game in the future if a teleport movement system was put in place.  For now, I'm going to have to recommend against buying this primarily because of the way it can cause motion sickness.tl;dr - The movement system in the game can cause bad motion sickness fairly quickly, even for those not overly prone to motion sickness.Pros:+ Interesting cell shaded art style+ Somewhat humorous storyline+ Retro look and feelCons:--- Movement system can cause severe motion sickness- First 2 guns feel weak and aiming seems off- Corpses tend to obscure vision"

Maybe it's better sitting down? Thanks for putting this out there though, I can see plenty of positive reviews from people who aren't as susceptible as me that are in line with what I saw, and it's great that there's a solid game like this contributing to the growth of VR."
,Not Recommended,534230,29026059,Posted: 4 January,all,Raywyn,"If you suffer from motion sickness in VR, do not play this game. The movement system is utterly nausea-inducing. Even friends who aren't prone to motion sickness found it difficult to maintain balance and stay upright while playing. The vertigo and nasea are nearly impossible to overcome.Outside of that: the art is kind of cute, though having cutsey gorey corpses constantly turn to face you in VR is kind of unsettling. I get that it's based on the old Doom engine and it's being accurate to that era, but it's still really offputting. Furthermore, the audio is downright atrocious. You'd be better off playing the game with the audio turned off. The story and premise are nothing to write home about either, managing to fail at taking itself seriously or being comical. I wasn't able to play too much of the game since it made me so sick, so maybe some of these issues get better later in the game.One last thing: It doesn't seem possible to pause the game. The closest you can get is to access the game's menu, which takes you back to the menu hub and forces you to restart the mission. While the first mission isn't very long, this seems like it could be big problem in later missions.My personal complaints aside, I'm glad that this game exists and that people generally seem to like it. I wish the developers all the best and hope they continue to create interesting and unique VR experiences. Hopefully this review is helpfull to others who suffer from motion sickness in VR games. :)"
