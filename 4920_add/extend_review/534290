If you enjoy that sort of game, then this is an absolute BUY.If you've never heard of Locomalito, then please google him right now. He's a Spanish indie dev who has been releasing incredibly fun games for years, absolutely FREE. All of his games ooze authenticity, and look, sound and play like games from the heyday of the 80's and 90's arcade era.  In fact, you owe it to yourself to go to his site and download a bunch of games -- Hydorah is especially great IMO if you enjoy Gradius style SHMUPs.""Cursed Castilla"" AKA ""Maldita Castilla EX"" is basically a reimagining of Capcom's ""Ghosts n""Goblins,"" albeit with its own flavor and twists. I wouldn't call it a clone per se, but clearly Locomalito played a lot of Capcom arcade games, and IMO this game is even better than its inspiration. This is Locomalito's first commercial game, and as a longtime fan of his games it makes me happy to see this enhanced version of one of his best games on STEAM.P.S. I am a paid customer and bought this game with my own money. It's worth it."

Locomalito has been making great little indie games for about 8+ years, all of them usually paying homage to 80s classic most of us grew up with. In the case of Cursed Castilla, we get a nice sort of take on Ghost and Goblins with influences from medieval Spanish and European mythologies. The pixel art is great as well as the FM infused music by Gryzor87. This new EX version adds 2 more levels for a total of 8 levels but also some new weapons, monsters and music. On top of all that, the controls are tight and responsive. So if you're looking to scatch that 16 bit arcadey itch, well here you go. I hope this won't be the last Locomalito game we see make its way to Steam."

,Recommended,534290,26135807,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,CougarBite,"Game is presented very well even offering different camera set ups if you prefer classic 4:3, with or without border, with or without scan lines, and can even stretch full-screen again with or without scan lines. The options continue well from here offering a codex on the monster, weapons, power ups, and even songs which adds well to the game and sometimes a forgotten touch in a game where learning patterns and behaviours is so important.The game is a platform shooter, yes you are a knight but all weapons shoot projectiles.The weapon selection in the game offers nice variety and by waiting by power ups you can pick which power up you have. Showing nice touch here as if you are speed running or competing  on points you can way up the use of the weapon you want versus the loss in time/points.The decision made in this game is to give the player for little control after jumping and in my mind adds some artificial difficulty in parts and finds my blaming the game for deaths which can lead to a spiral of hating a games difficulty rather then enjoying it.Enemy variety offered gives a great selection and leaves new challenges in each area, this is followed in to the boss selection, but again I will not speed run this game and I didn't take the game to serious instead using mass of continues. If you did want a serious run game then this is NOT for you too much RNG and too many times it leads to undodgable attacks, with one boss coming down to me just spamming attack as fast as possible and just retrying until his pattern worked for me.Graphics are great for the style the game wanted and worked well with the sprites and backgrounds, the character is not over animated so starts quick and responsive,(video to come)"

It includes a few new weapons and items, two new stages, the usual steam goodies (trading cards, achievements, backgrounds, etc.) and an overall presentation boost from the free version, which already was a highly polished game. In short, it's well worth the asking price for anyone who is a fan of these kinds of games, and if you're a fan of Ghost and Goblins, then you owe it to yourself to play this game.The difficulty is hard but fair, the FM music by Gryzor87 is nothing short of fantastic. I could go on, but you can see for yourself with the free version and see if you like it or not. If you like retro games, indie developers with a lot of heart pouring their souls into their works, spanish mythology, and a fun time, I don't see how you would not like it.FOR GOD AND CASTILLE!  (My only gripe with this version of the game is that the preceding famous line is now changed to ""For God and Castilla"", which is more accurate I suppose, but doesn't roll off the tongue as well imo)."

,Recommended,534290,26235696,"Posted: 26 October, 2016",all,Pal,"¡Por Dios y por Castilla!Maldita Castilla EXis a love letter to old 16-bit action platformers by Locomalito. He’s been known for making high quality old school arcade styled games using a donationware model, and Maldita Castilla EX is his first commercial breakthrough. Published by Abylight Studios, this version presents a few additions to the freeware classic including two new levels, new weapons, a codex, achievements, trading cards and all the good stuff to justify putting a price tag on it.The game is clearly inspired by arcade classicGhosts ‘n Goblins, however like any Locomalito game it doesn’t really stick to the formula of its inspiration, rather the game also sprinkles nods and elements of other similar games likeBlack TigerorCastlevaniaamong many other classics while also injecting a bit of unique personal touches.The gameplay is simple enough, you must traverse through 8 stages killing enemies in the way and defeating a midboss and a boss in each stage. Not all levels are straightforward though as some will be more open ended in design and hide plenty of treasures, including the 5 gems that unlock the true ending which increases replayability. While the task itself sounds simple, carrying it out is not as the game is relentlessly difficult. Unlike arcades of oldMaldita Castilla EXdoubles the length of your average stage and implements a strict difficulty level in every single one of them. The game gives you 3 lives with 3 health points per life and has unlimited continues but by the end of the game I’ve had used 54 continues through almost three hours of continuous play and the frustration could really be felt.The game completely nails the 16-bit era of arcades with its graphics and sound, every sprite to every detail of the backgrounds is meticulously hand-drawn pixel by pixel in order to ensure the highest level of detail possible while respecting the limitations of the era. The music was composed by Gryzor87 in FM synthesis with specs similar to the Yamaha YM2203 chip that arcades of the time were using. The presentation follows the same pattern, with high-score tables, cutscenes, map screens, everything feels straight out of an arcade of the late 80s and really feels as though you are playing a really old arcade game you’ve never heard of instead of a PC game.Maldita Castilla EXis an excellent game, though I find the incredibly high difficulty to be a tall barrier of entry for many. Even though the game can be forgiving enough by allowing you to continue from the same screen and from the beginning of a stage if you quit and leave for another day, the game can and will be really frustrating but entirely doable. In every other aspect it excels and is a worthy purchase to any old school fan who has been craving for some tight action platforming."

Both graphics and contols stick to the feeling of the old days, but are slighly modernized for a better experience. There is a ""continue"" system but no game over you have endless credits. Do you exit the game before completing a chapter ! This is the only checkpoints that are actually saved by the game. The difficulty is very well balanced, this game is a challenge, but one that is doable for most."
76561198161628677,Recommended,534290,31382805,Posted: 26 April,all,lastride,"Cursed Castilla is an arcade action game which is based and inspired by the Ghosts and Goblins series and other retro titles. It brings an 16 bit graphics style, a quick action packed gameplay with tight controls and a high level of difficulty.The story is set in the Middle Ages in the Spanish Kingdom. You play as a knight who is sent on a quest -together with other 3 fellow knights- by the King to cleanse the Kingdom from the evading demonic horde. The story basically is a Spanish mythos and there are several parts of the game where creatures from other European mythologies appear. Since the creators are Spanish the game overall in its music and its design has a Spanish vibe.The game is colorful and has I think hand drawn graphics, which look awesome. Aesthetically it all fits so well together. It has a retro style but also looks fresh and cheerful since it displays an arcade style. The creatures are well designed and there is a huge variety of enemies to counter. What stands out however are the bosses. There is a huge diversity between them and there was a lot of creativity in their design. For me it was the most interesting part of the game.The controls are almost identical to the Ghosts n Goblins games, tight as hell and you have to be very precise otherwise the game punishes you like it’s no tomorrow. And since you get the good ending only when you lose a certain amount of continues it will frustrate you a lot when you start losing repetitively. There is also a variety of weapons you can use but I found out that only 2-3 weapons are playable in the later stages so there is not much into it.The music is decent, not memorable though like other recent platformers I played but most of tracks are kind of catchy and they fit the stages they are played to.The game overall is very hard. A look at the achievement percentages displays how frustrating the game can be. Some achievements at the earlier stages of the game are only completed by 10-15% of the players, which is insane. In my opinion the game pays tribute to the classics also to that aspect, that of the reward that comes from mastering the controls and being very patient.Sadly there isn’t much replay ability once you get the good endings, however that could take you forever like it took me 30 hours. Overall Cursed Castilla was a great retro experience despite the high difficulty and I would recommend playing it to anyone who has ever owned a 8-16 bit console and likes these types of games."

,Recommended,534290,30906590,Posted: 2 April,all,ANIMEHITLER,"This game is wonderful.While gameplay-wise it is more or less Ghouls 'n' Ghosts, it is clearly made with quite a lot of passion. So much attention was lovingly given to the details in this game - the graphics, sound, and controls all authentically capture the feel of a platforming game from the early 90s. The music and sound effects perfectly capture the aesthetic of the Sega Genesis sound chip, the sprites are all lovingly detailed and well animated, without any of the pixel size discrepancy that you might see in more modern games that attempt to be retro - I bet they even took into account the hardware limitations of 16 bit platformers of the era, and tried to design the sprites around the limited color palette provided by consoles of the early 90s.The game is quite challenging, but fun in the way that it keeps you coming back. Even though you die, you keep wanting to try again. It truly captures the Capcom feel in that regard, and also rewards you for challenging yourself to complete the game with less credits, or collecting all the key items hidden in each stage. There is even a speedrun mode available for those who are interested. This game is an underrated gem and if you like platformers of the early 90s you owe it to yourself to get this game."

Ghosts n Goblins is not easy I don't know why you'd expect this game to be. You have unlimited continues, use them. Arcades made us start at the begining so even though the game is hard beating a proper GnG arcade is certainly harder.

Be warned, Castilla is BRUTALLY old school difficult and that kinda is what turns me off.  Ghosts and Goblins I can at least argue will not saddle you with a bad ending for using the infinite continues and I'm burnt out from some of the frustrating platforming.That said, the soundtrack is excellent, gameplay is old school Ghosts and Goblins with a few innovative tweaks, and the graphics are gorgeous as far as retro goes. Both really charming and really gory and macabre.  I would love to get further in this and see the deeper levels, but I know when something is going to cause me more frustration that joy.  This, like Volgarr the Viking, wear me out too much at this point in my life.So, why the thumbs up?  Well...it's good.  It's not a bad game, it's a lot of fun when you're not in the frustrating moments leading to that ominous continue screen.  Those who can deal with difficult games and who are into speed running will love this, but it's just not for me, hence why I'm refunding it.  Nothing but respect for Locomalito, it's a great game and I hope it's a success and more of their games come to Steam."
