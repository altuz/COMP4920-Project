One small island.  Glitchy movement where invisible floor levels will suddenly raise you up or drop you down.  One girl is standing specifically in one of these places so you're floating above her.  The girls always stare at your forehead - its unsettling.  Not as unsettling as when you stand behind them and you can actually see the neck mesh twist 180 degrees while the character model stays perfectly still.   Or how every one of them remains completely static apart from the neck/head moving backwards (usually through scenery or furniture) to get away from you.TL:DR - its cheap, but i would be highly critical even if this was free.  Its not even a tech demo - its a glitchy mess.  Avoid as if its digital-syphillis.  Because it is."

Made me look.It's about a dollar more expensive than it should be.This is like cellphone quality titillation, with teleportation. You fly around an island ogling playstation-2 quality vr-grills. Again, it's not bad, because it's on Steam. The state of the art in the land of the rising sun is already out of this world... but I still require a steady stream of click-bait to sully the activity feed of those in my friends list, so byteframe is appreciative, but others should't make a purchase. Anyway, please continue to seperate me from my money with VR apps of this kind.Bait me!Happy Women's Day!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=879684316"

,Not Recommended,534480,29979364,Posted: 17 February,all,dustums,"All you do is move around and look at models, which might be okay if those models weren't of such terrible quality.  They are skinned all wrong such that strange polygons poke out at most of their joints, and they all have dead eyes that stare forward with no movement or blinking.  It's a terrible experience."
,Not Recommended,534480,29944614,Posted: 15 February,all,Crafty,"Well if you've watched the video on the store page, then you've pretty much seen it all.  This should be free unless the devs add more content and some interaction to the gameplay.  It should not even have ""sexual content"" and ""nudity"" tags.  There's none of that.  Just scantilly dressed models in rather boring motion loops.  Don't pay for this... even $2, you will be disappointed."

76561198053241064,Recommended,534480,29885742,Posted: 12 February,all,Stoneball,"This game works...sort of. There just isn't much to it, and that includes actual gameplay. I get the impression it's more of a proof-of-concept than anything else. If it moves forward with actual content it might be fun.Anyway, it's worth the $2 I paid for it. I've paid more for worse games than this.So, if you want to see what a VR version of Second Life might look like, this is it, minus all the interaction."
,Recommended,534480,29622185,Posted: 31 January,all,FarewellVHS,"The days of going to a real world strip club are numbered.This title really shows the potential of the VR adult industry and therefore I'm supporting it over something like Nancy's Summer VR that's ridden with gimmicky in game pretend money. But it also needs major improvements. Big props to the developer for giving this a shot :)Largest ProblemsFor the following things and in general, there needs to be a basic tutorial of the controls. Not with text on a wall, but a clever video of the controllers' buttons being pushed corresponding to an avatar running or zooming around. Think universal understanding despite known language. Scrap the teleport system and include a noclip free fly mode like in the old days of video games. To avoid motion sickness, Google Earth VR's method might be best: when you move, your field of view narrows and when you come to a stop, you can look or walk around freely. There should be options to freeze or slow down time. Also a free mode where we can change the position of the sun and therefore lighting by aiming at it, clicking and dragging like in Google Earth VR. Moves, actions and ways to control where the models walk around should have their own in game menu. Think Garry's Mod type of freedom. You currently have to physically duck down and stand up to get the VR benefits over a normal monitor game here. Further, you have to constantly turn around to see everyone, so add a Google Tilt Brush world-spin mode where we squeeze the grip buttons on each controller and make a motion like we're spinning a box on a table and the entire world rotates. Why do we have hands at all when they can't interact with anything? The controllers should at least have some simple haptic feedback when they bump into people and the characters need to respond in some way. The models should have physics, not just be solid mannequins.Good ThingsI like the 3 times of day with different poses and nighttime dance party. Everything looks fairly good in terms of atmosphere. Most the models look pretty nice and even though the teleport system doesn't work for this type of title, its implementation was pulled off very well.General AnnoyancesThe models look good at times, but very blocky or ""The Thing"" level creepy as they twist backwards looking at you. Their shadows at night are especially pixelated. Music magically comes from either the house or fire pit, but there needs to be a boombox, haha. The models' skin texture is flat and very shiny. Each limb clips through adjacent ones. Many models are frozen. Basic motion loops are definitely needed for all.WishlistMake the models become ragdolls on command, like in Half Life 2, maybe by touch or poking them in the eyes XD Then the hands could pick up the ragdolls and move them around. Then we'd need a Garry's mod style ragdoll poser tool. Add scripting tool to make the models do group events. Maybe we model the capture ourselves with the Vive tracking system as players and save it into the game with a further editor? The boombox should support our own music libraries like the jukebox in SportsBar VR or at least have several basic ones to choose from.Perhaps on Steam, list that there is extra website or workshop content that will be more adult. Like interactive scenes, skins, LGBT+ (Rainbow), BDSM, etc items if not allowed on main store or in game DLC.Issues with Digital Adult Entertainment at LargeVR Adult video is mostly being pursued now, but I think the 3D market with titles like this will be far bigger and more customizable. While Gabe Newell hinted in a recent Reddit AMA that some kind of adult Steam game section may show up at some point, there is a major rift today. Titles like this, no matter how compelling in premise, seem to always get terrible funding and talent shoved their way. (major props to this developer for their work so far!) If this game, or genre I suppose, actually had AAA funding and years of development, this industry would be amazing. But because of social stigmas and some kind of war on the Adults-Only rating across every physical or digital storefront, it's a catch 22 for much of anything to change."

(Although it should have been free.) A few bugs still apparent. On another note I am surprized there hasn't been complaints about the lack of different race's or Men for that matter. A paradise island only populated by white women. Not really catering to a diverse multicultural/sexual market.

It's a cleverly done and relaxing environment. Think Vive Home with a soundtrack and dancing girls. My MSI gtx980 with 32 gb of ddr4 handled it flawlessly, it looked gorgeous. For the same cost as 3 candy bars, I'd say yes."
