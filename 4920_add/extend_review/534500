It is a very simple, yet highly addictive game that you can lose yourself in for hours, think of Dynasty Warriors, but with multiplayer and customization. This game is still in the works, and you can see where it needs to be polished, but in all this game is fantastic and is worth the time."
76561198085348192,Recommended,534500,29969409,Posted: 16 February,all,bradstew4u,"Dynasty Warriors + Mount and Blade + Kessen. Very good game. The community isn't too toxic and there are peak times where matchmaking doesn't take too long. At early EST times it is difficult to find players but there is always AI and sometimes the AI is more useful than your teammates. It's a 5v5 team deathmatch with a guarded general on each side. There are 3 camps; a unit camp, a supply camp, and a health camp. You need to capture each camp which is a channel for about 8 seconds. Your units and 'guardian' will follow you and you may use troop/guardian skills + formations to kill your opponents. There is such a thing as strategic retreat and class troops and better vs others as you will see and the same goes for the weapons and armor you choose to wear. There is a lot of customization in the game and the devs are releasing even more content tomorrow (written 1 day before Rome comes out). You don't need to pay any money for the game just be aware to not spend copper without thinking it over. When you get to T5+ (level 5 troops) the experience needed to get to T6-T10 is a lot of hours put into the game.During matchmaking you will be matched with people that have your troop level so ignore the 'I got matched with op troops and didn't have a chance' comments because they probably used T3's and didn't hit the 'play with AI' button or something like that.I am an old school Koei fan before they screwed their games up and this game reminds me a lot of Dynasty Warriors 4 XL with Kessen features such as troop/guradian skills, with Mount and Blade combat. And it's free so you literally have nothing to lose!EDIT: I did not purchase any DLC before I wrote this comment. However, after actually looking at the DLC and reading why people purchased the DLC, play the game a little and if you like it buy the Classic or Collection Pack. For the money these DLC's are way worth it but most of all it is important to give back to the devs, since this is a free game after all. You can buy things in game that will help you earn money/exp but these packs are a much better value. The Classic pack will set you up for a month of gameplay. I am going to buy some DLC so that the devs understand how many people enjoy their game.Devs listen to the community. This game is great if you like Dynasty Warriors, Mount and Blade, Kessen, Hack and Slash, Battlefield Tactics, Strategy, Chivalry, and like games!"

In all honesty I expected it to be a clunky, unfinished and pay to win distraction and no more than that.What I actually found was an innovative, fun and tactical game that you can pick up and put down whenever you want. I wholeheartedly suggest giving this game a try, lovers of strategy and fast paced pvp gameplay will love this title.Pros -fast gameplayVaried MapsRewarding Tech TreesEnjoyable Team ExperienceWell thought out and balancedsurprisingly innovative for a chinese titleCons -very unintuitive UIassive problems with PvP balancing (level 5 troops verss level 2 happens more than it should - should NEVER happen)Needs more troop variation and weapon variationOverall try this game, its free, what have you to lose, other than a lot of time playing because its an addictive experience"

Game is set in Three Kingdoms of ancient China around year 200 BC with promise from developers to add rome armies (why, just why?). Gameplay is classic rock-paper-scissors system to some degreee yet to be balanced. It's basically 3rd person game where you control your hero and command your troops at the same time.

,Recommended,534500,29403909,Posted: 21 January,all,dog101625 | csgolive.com,"TL;DR the game has a lot of variety and fun strategy to it and i think you would have fun playing itOkay... where to start... umm i got this game, i cant run it (lagged like hell cuz my computer is potato)... HOWEVER, i still love this game because eventhough my frames were crap, i decided to look up gameplay and i tried so hard to play the game and even though i cant run it i still enjoyed just watching it, now from some people's points of view, its just fighting head-on and killing and thats it. No its more than that, which is why i tried so hard to run it on this piece of junk called my computer. Tiger Knight is a strategy game (more specifically an RTS game) that appeals to players that like to attack using well thought out plans of hitting the enemy, and it really does feel rewarding when you can make a plan very quickly and get a victory. The maps are very well made and you can use the different types of troops to your advantage, for example if you have archers, you can go on the top of the hill, or another nice vantage point of the main fighting area and just rain arrows on your opponents but here is where things can sometimes become a little tricky, you can hurt teamates, so dont swing your weapons or shoot them off like toys (even though it can sometimes be fun to mess around :P) cavalries are good at flanking, mainly because of speed, but some maps are not good with cavalry just because of the way they were designed, and many more things you can do with the other types of units you can control. Just so we're clear here (because i made the mistake of thinking this), when you buy the archer unit, you do not get a bow as well, unless you go to the archers research tree and actually buy the bow and arrows for yourself, because the way tiger knight works is that when you buy units, you can upgrade your units and those uprgrades can also be used to buy for yourself, for example if your playing with pikemen, you can buy armor upgrades for them (which visually changes their clothing and sometimes the type of armor that they are wearing) and after you researched it and bought it for the unit, you can then buy it for yourself if you'd like to, or you could just buy the armor upgrade for yourself and not your units, but in order to get that upgrade you must actually still research it, even if your not getting it for your troops, and soon they will be adding rome to the game (right now they have 3 factions which for some reason i can not remember the name of). I think the developers keep their players well updated on what they are doing and i believe that they are doing a good job on the game, SO GO PLAY TIGER KNIGHT, IT LOOKS FUN BUT I CANT PLAY IT AND I LOVE STRATEGY."

,Recommended,534500,29434052,Posted: 22 January,all,SusuKacangSoya (No mic),"I have not encountered the problems Chronic-X have encountered, probably because I am merely T4. All games I've played are with T4s and T5s, with a T3 once in a while; slots the game cannot fill with players are filled with similarly ranked bots.The issues I have with this game is the colosally slow progression for unlocking equipment, and how the game decides where a catapult can shoot. I have lost a large amount of games due to trying to man the catapult but finding out that 85% of the spots I need to hit are banned from targeting, for some reason, even though they are well within range; while I'm frantically trying to get that perfect spot that is allowed, my teammates are already mostly dead.That aside, if you want to kill time, this game is a pretty good choice. There is a good offering of equipment, generals (and the troop formations that you get with them), gamemodes and maps; the last of which I feel is the best aspect of TK:EW.Also, the game is not dangerously addictive. You will play match after match, but after 2 or 3 hours (i.e. dozen or more games), you will find yourself satisfied enough to quit."

,Recommended,534500,30075979,Posted: 21 February,all,SGC Gambit,"It's like the developer took a long hardened wood pole of a melee third person fighter with an arrow shaped tip of roleplay customization and stuffed it into a mutliplayer online battle arena. The battles get grindy, the kind of grindy with manly men bumping and grinding into each other as their beaten, sweaty bodies pound together in a desperate attempt to shove their fierce hard weapon shaft into the mix. The men doing their sword fighting in close formations charging and penetrating into each other all for the glory of their manlihoods. Because there are no girls allowed on the battlefield. You must posses either a sword, or a spear, or some kind of pole or other hardened shaft with a dangerous tip to get a chance for glory! The men shall gather in circle formations to display their prowess with a firm grip on their preferred weapon!I am Patrolmeus, Combobro of Rome. Now hear me type. I have fought many battles as a Tiger Knight, waging an Empire War for my glorious homeland. I serve Rome! Do you have what it takes to wage war amongst the deadly Tiger Knight Generals of the East? Dare you face the sheilds of Rome? Are you worthy of the title, TIGER KNIGHT?This is a wonderful game and for a Free 2 Play game that is NOT Pay 2 Win... it's amazing. Once it is ready for launch I think it will be as good or better than similar AAA games. The fighting mechanics, similar to Mount and Blade, are very well done, and there are many strategies to learn to entice skilled players to get better and always try to improve for that next epic contest of skill. If you enjoy skill based fighting games and the competition of team based game modes... you may love this Dynasty Warriors / Mount and Blade hybrid MOBA.Not only is the fighting gameplay awesome, it looks good too... from what I understand all of the fighting moves were taken from motion capture of martial arts experts and put into animations for the game. There are so many different moves possible based on a wide variety of fighting styles and weapons. Players choose from steel, leather and cloth armor to match against blunt, slashing and poking weapons in a rock-paper-scissors system. It really is a ton of fun, and the large scale battles are intense! Try to get your combo on and dominate your enemies!I stream on Twitch most times I am playing, you can check me out there if you want to see what the game is like.https://www.twitch.tv/sgc_gambitI write this review shortly after the release of the Rome Update. I have to say I absolutely love the Roman units and their skills. It brings a completely different play style to the game, and I am so happy with their implementation. Sometimes after a good match using my Roman troops in formations and my Roman armor and I knock down my enemy and hit the execute button and I just want to scream ""ROMA!!!!!!!!!!!!""Yeah... uhhh... where was I?That's not to say the Chinese units aren't also badass. I have played through most troop lines and they are all unique and interesting. You should be able to find a troop line with a play style you like. So far, my favorite is Roman Infantry. TURTLE FORMATION!ROMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!There are always tweeks needed, especially with new content... so I will not mention anything currently wrong with bugs etc as it is early access and these devs seem very concerned with meeting their players expectations. Also, it is a Chinese development team and English is the second language, so English speakers will have to be patient while the translations are worked out. Some of the bad translations are hilarious though, my favorite: ""Winning or losing a battle is a common occurence!"" Or was that the proper translation?!I am a bit worried that the developers are only focusing on Command Mode. Duel Mode Deathmatch could be really awesome, with just a little bit of rules and team balance settings... it could be a game on it's own. It is super fun when there is not a ton of people exploiting early access weaknesses of the game engine. I hope the developers will make sure that game modes like this are playable and balanced by player count per team at the minimum, so that people have something to enjoy as they wait for the new content to be released, or for a player population to rise so they can finally play their high tier troops. I would like to see the player base continously go up instead of down, as I want this game to succeed.The only real complaint I have about this game, assuming bugs and balance issues that happen in early access get taken care of... is the grindiness to leveling up troops. You have to play a lot of games to move up to a new troop tier, making it precious, and with a limited number of barracks slots there is little motivation to keep lower tier troops. Basically, what most players will do is just level up.. go through and play a tier until they get the higher tier and once they max tier... then they play max tier? If there are enough players. I'm not saying this is 100%, for example I prefer T6 Rome units to the T7, and with the 3 level system that's fine.The issue I have with the grindy level up process of increasing troop tiers is that the developers seem to be most interested in making this game a MOBA. The primary mode of gameplay  Command Mode... but by separating into tiers and making it grindy to upgrade to the next level, it makes lower level troops nearly obsolete. Most MOBAs give you a choice to pick from dozens or more Heros that are all supposed to be viable to play against any other Hero. But in this game, you can only play against people using the same tier of troops. It's trying to mix leveling up with a MOBA, and I just don't know if that will work in the long run. Why not have 100% of your player base able to play against every other player... and base matchmaking on ELO or some system not troop tier.The ultimate problem with the leveling-up approach is that players will treat it like reaching max level... and then you're done. Now you have achieved the higheest level troop level up and what's left to do. I know the obvious response is to play with that highest troop type, but with a system like this most players will give up before reaching highest level, and it will atrophy until there's barely no one left playing top tiers. Unless the game is super popular and has so many people addicted enough to get to max tier through all the grind.The tier system of different powered units splits the population in a way that does not even compensate for skill level. It may seem like new players will play at low tiers, and experienced players will play top tiers... but there's nothing stoping a veteran player from playing among low tiers and decimating everything against fresh players. So it doesn't even help with organizing by player skill level. I don't really know how they would change it at this point, I just hope the game survives to get enough population for people to play at top tiers at some point without the match being filled with bots.Hopefully they come out with some great solutions for their players and I hope the player population continually increases for this game that has great potential! Moreso than other early access games I have seen, the developers are responsive to players and interested in hearing what the players think to make the best game possible. And it's free... you really only have to pay for things if you like the game and want to contribute for extras that do not effect the game's power dynamics. The game even balances based on tiers, so that higher tier equipment in a lower tier setting has it's stats reduced accordingly to create a more level playing field. I've seen skilled players run around in PvP with no or very low tier armor and low tier weapons be very effective.Try this game out so you can face me on the field of battle, but you better be prepared; I am Patrolmeus, Combobro of Rome."

Great balance.Edit: Played some more, got matched against a three person group with people using some of the best equipment in the game with the best adjutants when I had basic equipment. That's completely reasonable, matchmaker doesn't exist at all to add insult to injury. (For comparison, if you play World of Tanks, it's like bringing a T-34 against an E-100.)"

76561198158275117,Recommended,534500,29727045,Posted: 5 February,all,INFINITY,"I love this game, when I first started and it had the begining tutorial audio in Chinese I was woundering what this even was.The game is in Chinese with the audio but subtitles and everything else can be in English so don't worry about that.After that was done I tried my first game which I would say is the biggest mistake you can make.What I recommend everyone starting out should do is do ALL of the tutorials on all difficulties until you at least get to the ""Actual Combat"" Tutorial ad that can be pretty hard on its own. If you do all of the other tutorials; Chopping, Parry, Archery, and Horsemanship; on all difficulties and maybe Actual Combat on easy you should get the hang of the game by then.Doing all of these can help you find out what weapons you would like to use.You can use a sword & shield, two-handed sword, spear, bow and arrow, sling rocks, throw spears, and more. Doing his can help you find out what type of troops you would like to start out with as well. You won't have access to all types of troops immediately so I recommend looking through all of the different Infantry, Archers, and Cavalry on each Upgrade Tree.Right now there are the Wei, Shu, & Wu trees and in a future update the Rome tree.Each tree has their own special types of troops and their own style to them as well. As you go further up through the trees the higher the gear and troops you can get. You will have to work hard for these so use your Prestige & Copper wisely.Prestige is the Exp points you get after every battle, there are two different types, the Gold prestige that you can use for anything and the silver prestige you can use for the troop that you used to get that prestige. Copper you get after every match to buy gear/troops after you have unlocked that gear/troops with prestige.There is VIP which is an exp/copper multiplier that increases the amount of prestige/exp/ & copper you get after every match.Now to the Game ModesThere is Command Mode- Conquest that you can play whenever either PvP or PvE based on what settings you choose.There are 2 teams and at your home camp there is a flag that you can get more of your troops from if you have lost any.You and your team can do 3 things.A. Kill all enemy players, each player has their own troops to command so it won't be so easy.B. Kill the enemy Marshal, there is 1 marshal for your team at your home base and there is an enemy marshal at the enemy home base, you can see where they are on the minimap. P.S. They have alot of health so you would need to have all of one person and their troops attacking AT LEAST to do any real damage.C. On the battlefield there are three flags each that give you and your team an advantage on the battlefield.1. Medical Camp- Once captured click E to restore most of your health (and your horse if you are on one) over a period of time.2. Supply Camp- Can restore any ammo you have lost for ranged weapons and can give you back your horse if it died or you lost it.3. The Recruitment Camp- A Camp that will give you 10-15 troops of a Random type added to your team that you can control if you got them. I know of Cavalry, Archers, Haevy Pikemen, & a battalion with clubs that you can get from that camp.Once you get to General lvl 15 you can play Command Mode- Sige which is basically one team defends a forst as the other defends it and the Marshal inside. The attack team is able to choose a battering ram to go through the front door or a siege tower.There are camps on the way to the fort that you can attack/defend depending what team you are on. You do have infinite lives.It is pretty rare to get into a siege match at this time so make sure you know what you are doing before you go into a match all willy nilly and get yourself killed.Another game mode is Duel Mode which is simply battles in between 2 teams of players vs eachother and whichever team gets the most kills wins.Then there is Epic War PvE which so far only has one mission where you siege a fort to kill a Marshal with a nice story to it. You have to be a General lvl 5 to play easy mode, but on easy you can't complete the whole mission as you will get a ""to be continued..."" at the end of it. On normal mode you have to be a General lvl 12 with soldier lvl 5 in order to play it and do the Entire mission. You do have to play Easy mode once before you can play Normal though. There is also a Hard mode which requires General lvl 20 and soldier lvl 7 and you have to complete normal difficulty 3 times. The higher the difficulty the better chance at getting better gear at the end of the match via a literal target that you can select with a random reward.I have to give this game a 9/10 simply because the only problems I have had are that it make take longer than it should when joining matches at times. So I hope this review helps people understand what there is in the game/ how to start/ what there is to do. Hope to continue to see more players every day!"

I don't get how you can make a game so similar to Warband and yet have it feel less satisfying, less responsive and less immersive than a game made ten years ago. The translations have been improved, but are still terrible, and the English voice acting would have been better if it had just been cut. I would rather just have text on screen telling me what to do, rather than have badly translated text on screen, while a really bad non-fluent voice actor says something completely different at the same time. I know people have been saying it's fine, and you can still figure out what they mean, but there have literally been times where I have not had a ♥♥♥♥ing clue what they were trying to bring across. Other points to bring up would be the terrible menu system that basically opens the game as a new program every time you try to join a battle, and the fact that half the keys can't actually be rebound. You had over 100 keys to choose from, and you chose to bind and lock the Charge ability to Double-W... now every time I'm trying to lightly dance around my opponent on the outskirts of a battle, I accidentally press W twice and suddenly my guy charges head on into the center of the group of enemies behind my opponent like a berzerker. I don't even get the point of having ""Special attacks"" and ""Combos"" in a game like this. Should have just kept it down to earth, simple and responsive. Also, the screen is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess when you're in a battle because all the units clip into each other and it's impossible to see what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on. Again, not an issue we had in Warband... a game made ten years ago.TLDR; Just go play Warband until this has been worked on for a few more months."

To me however it feels a lot more polished and smooth. You create your character with some visualization options and pick a starting camp (not really important atm because you can just choose a class from any faction you like and switch at all times) and then you pick your ""class"".your class determines what kind of units or ""armies"" you will controll while fighting among them on the battlefields. there are a lot of different kind of units to choose from with different stats, weapons and abilities. you upgrade them as you play the game and unlock new units.pay 2 win you ask? well not at all actually!first of all you get basically showered with gifts like vip cards and such (never ever payed money yet and i guess you really dont have to if you dont mind the grind. not that bad tho.. not as bad like heroes and generals was when i played it.), also you cant just pay money and upgrade your character and units that way. even if you would buy yourself some sweet equipment (most of it seems to be cosmetic though) youd still have to play the game and invest time into it to even use the stuff. so you cant just stay well im spending a 100 bucks now and ill get the best armor and units and smash everybody. there is no pay 2 win at all which is what most reviewers are saying. secondly there is a matchmaking system where you are matched with people with the same unit level. that means not your characters level but the tier of your units. so if you choose to fight with your basic tier units you will fight against others with basic tier units. and there is something done to your characters equipment too . it is not seperate from your units equipment level. i guess there are some other measures to prevent imbalance aswell it keeps telling me something about matchmaking and my equipment during the loading screens but i never paid attention. (sorry!)the different classes all have its pros and cons and no class seems overpowered to me yet.there are multiple game modes. there is conquest where you either kill all generals (players. no respawn.) or their marshall (basically take over their base) and to get some advantages you capture mutliple resource sites. (heiling, reinforcements etc) then there is siege. (well its a siege.) duel and team deathmatch, epic war (coop missions) and scheduled battles. you can create legions and parties. teamplay is very important and if you put no thought or tactics in your gameplay you will most likely loose. the graphics and animation quality are very nice and run very decent for an ""early"" Early Acess game. you really get an immersive feeling when you run over the battlefield, all bloodied, your horse dead and trampling over ""mountains"" of corpses. you also have to command your units of course.so the pros to me are- mount and blade like combat system- controll your own troops- good graphics (runs fine for me and im no high end pc user)- various gamemodes- no pay 2 win (business model seems fair)- nice community- frequent updates- multiple classesand the cons are (few)-  a bit grindy-  rarely the game lags for me- frames can drop obviously (with that many bodies running round and falling over)- although there is a good number of maps sometimes i get the same two maps over and over again)- sometimes people dont ready up before the match starts and you have to search again (bug ?)seriously for an early access game that is f2p its one hell of a game. even if it wasnt f2p it would be a really cool game.its always nice to come back to it.try it its free you cheap arses!"

They always get in my way and they take too much effort to be utilized practically, where as charge infantry are more efficient (in my opinion).Finally, always remember that the sight is in the front.

As of this time, I cannot recommend this game.Tiger Knight: Empire War is not an ambitious title. They aim to take the mechanics of Mount & Blade and mix them with the platform popularized by the World of X (Tanks, Warships, etc) series. The player takes commant of an officer (controlled directly as the player character), an adjutant (who follows the player, but is an AI character), and a unit of soldiers, directed by a couple of very basic commands.Unfortunately, they took more from the WoX end of things than M&B. Melee combat aspires to be deep, but manages to make most weapons unwieldy or ineffective. Balance is nonexistant as of the current patch. As a result, there are basically two useable options for the player to use in combat: ranged or polearm. The different strikes and blocks available might be meaningful if the game reflected the user's inputs or the netcode was good enough to make it possible to react to anything before it already happened.So you have left-click spam for the most part for the officer combat. Not very exciting, certainly nothing new. Adjutants merely exist to give formation and order options for the soldiers under their command. Functional but limited, no complaints there aside from a lack of customization.The troops themselves should be the meat of what makes the game interesting, but they suffer tremendously from the limitations of the game's engine. They have a tendancy to either attack ineffectually or not at all. Customization is minimal, with there being either linear improvement upgrades (spear, better spear) or none at all for the most part. Balance is again poor, and the orders you can give units are often ignored or carried out in ways you'd prefer they had been ignored.The graphics are functional but unremarkable, the combat is clunky, and the netcode is second-rate. For a free game that lets you ram Wei into Shu into Romans, it's good for a little amusement. For something to invest time, strategy, or God forbid money, Tiger Knight: Empire War is a poor choice."

,Recommended,534500,30103447,Posted: 22 February,all,Satoverlord,"Overview:The game developer took the pay-to-progress approach, which means upgrading is extremely grindy (like War Thunder). On the other hand, any progression will makes you feel great. (Say, having your character upgraded from a foot-soilder-alike wearing cloth to a commander with armor)The Community:The community is generally nice and helpful: You can get help by simply asking in the public chat. And sometimes, people will start a history lecture/discussion.To fellow M&B players:You would probably find this game familiar. Most of the controls are the same. But additional tactical options for troops makes the game have its own flavor.If you play a lot of M&B, you will likely do pretty well in this game.So...perhaps it's a good game to play while waiting for Bannerlord.Regarding DLCs:There are DLCs with non-gameplay-breaking preminum content. But you don't necessarily need any of them. Personally, I don't understand the bashing towards the DLCs of this game; of course, this is an early-access game, but keep in mind it's a f2p MMO game. Devs need an income, right?Again, none of the DLCs are ""necessary"", you can still play just fine without any of them and enjoy a lot.Language:Kudos to the Devs for using Traditional Chinese and accurate English. Would like to have Japanese and Korean if possible. Also Cantonese audio, coz...well...historical accuracy? :3TL:DR CONCLUSION:Overall a great non-p2w f2p game. Don't mind about the grind, try something different each round and you will enjoy Tiger Knight a lot."

,Not Recommended,534500,30086689,Posted: 21 February,all,Kaiser the Mouse,"I can't really say anything good about this game, a lot of my exprience was frustration, and reminders that there are better games of this type and genre out there.First off, I'd like to say, this uses the exact model that the ""World of..."" military series of online MMO's uses. (World of Tanks, World of Warships, World of Warplanes) While this isn't a bad thing and works quite well, there's some rough balancing issues. At the high tiers everyone pretty much uses the exact same load outs(Same horse, same pike, not using a horse or pike will quickly lead to your death, foot soldiers/archers or heavy infanty need not apply, you will die(not including the broken repeating crossbows), which is boring. Yes they use a good model, but there's already loads and loads of this game type adopted the model, and do it far better.Secondly, they use the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" period and play off that. This would be great, but again...Dynasty warriors does it so much better, in gameplay, setting, and interest that I find myself wishing I was playing those games instead.Then final nail in the coffin though would be the lag, holy lord have I not had such bad lag (high ping on all 3 servers, NA giving the best ping but still being useless for any ""fun"" pvp) in an mmo since 2007. Get some decent servers before you try releasing an mmo you plebes. This is especially bad and adds to the whole, needing a pike and horse thing. Pike being the longest weapons and horse being the fastest mode of transportation, both taking advantage of the games lag, no archer in hell can hit anyone on horse back, it's even difficult to time melee swing to hit someone on horseback because you never know when you'll lag suddenly and miss. I found myself playing a lot against AI's so that I could actually test to see if the game was fun, because playing pvp online is painful atm, which is what this game is supposed to be about. My team leads our hundred plus soldiers into a battle against their hundred plus.Finally, the community was your typical steam cancer. Having a VAC ban is always nice to test a community, and when I made a topic in the forums asking a simple question about if anyone noticed matchmaking issues since a recent patch, I was told to kill myself because I have a VAC ban...by multiple people, totally off topic, all of which have their profiles private of course.I was gonna let this review sit as is, and just forget the whole nightmare that is the people working for the development company. After some drama in the forums in which multiple community members harassed me off topic for VAC, and I took it without returning any anger or maliciousness just calmly telling these people it's off topic, and what they're saying makes no sense. The community manager then of course sided with the harassment, adding into it, and then when threatened to be reported, he banned me from the forums for inciting hate speech and racism? Which is false, you can see his ""proof"" of my rediculously racist crime and hate on the community on my steam profile images. I laughed this off, people will be dumb of course...but then what I assume is a seperate representative, a day later, began spamming this review.Now that the rant is over with, I'll add in a couple more shots.The game heavily abuses steams ""early access"" in order to gain more people jumping on board quickly. With a recent patch, they also lowered the XP rate exponentially in order to sell their ""DLC"" and Pay to Win that they have on the in game shop...starting to see the problem here?DLC on an early access beta game? That's...not weird or anything. So what they're trying to tell us, is...they finished content for their unfinished game, but instead of adding it to the unfinished game to bring it closer to completion, they are selling it? The whole thing sounds like a ""free"" to play scam, IS a ""free"" to play scam and should be avoided. I expect to see more comments from the lovely community and managers sometime in the short future as they LOVE to defend themselves and be dramatic aparently.Usually I don't do reviews, you can probably guess why, I'm terrible at them and don't find them very fun to do, however, I've never had an experience quite like this with ""professionals"" from a gaming company and a games community before. I hope they learn, it's best to just ignore people, and trying too hard to defend yourself makes you look worse, not better.Of course, even after saying all this, I'm the devil in the wrong because I have a VAC ban, which of course is an even worse felony than being convicted for murder, theft, and blackmail."

You contol little armies of guys which progress in terms of gear and quantity as you move up in tiers of soldiers for you particular faction, the fun thing about the upgrading is that you and your soldiers use the same gear from a WoT-esque upgrade tree but you still feel like a dynasty warriors character because you can mow through the npcs that are poorly managed by other players.Then there's the tactics, the troops actually matter in the game, maybe not at early tier but they do matter later on because they're bassicaly meat shields that can be used to help you either cull the enemy in an epic 5vs5 commander battle or when you've swarmed an enemy general and you're too lazy to just duel them and the great thing is that there's no need for honour, people love to just ♥♥♥♥ you up with catapults whenever they like. The game could use with more common sense tactics as well, for example if you are hit, your units swarm towards you instead of keeping gaps of 2meters each which is what they do most of the time regardless of most formations"

At the moment, cav is OP2. The rome faction units are pretty damm cool3. The game is now 6 v 6, but most of the time there will only be about 5 players max on each team plus AI. In reality most games are a mix between 1-2 real plays and up to 3-4. Which brings me to point 44. The overall population is still kinda low. But match making has improved quite a bit, 1-2 minuete seaches max.5. An unknown # of people seem to have bugs and issues with the client, but hey, its a free to play game, its not perfect. If it means anything, I actually msged the devs about an in game screen issue, and they helped me trouble shoot it.Final Thoughts- The games got the content down. Devs are relasing new patches and updates every 3 weeks or so which is good. But the game will have some bugs, or units might not path correctly, etc, but hey, its a free to play game, so go into with open mind. 8.5/10 would recommendPROSplay as a warrior in 3rd person- have about 20-30 ai troops follow u around like a personal body guard- 6 v 6 matches- wide variety of weapons, maps, customization- devs try to stay up to date on things, adding new content, patches, etc- battles allow alot of depth, u can flank while on horseback, use square formation to repel enemy cav, use archers to skirmish, etcCONS- overall population is still kinda low, so matches often have 1-2 AIs- battles can get very clunky real quick, but its still requires skill- sometimes there's disconnect issuesOVERALL- its a free to play game, alot of value for no money- every match can be something new, try new troop types, new weapons, different tactic* will edit review as the game continues to grow and expand"

,Recommended,534500,29925137,Posted: 14 February,all,Havie,"This game Is extremely fun, and has a huge level of depth to it. It is so great to see a company try to produce a three kingdoms game that is a challenge unlike the 1v1,000,000 dynasty warriors series. my first impression seeing this game was that the graphics kinda suck, but once u get into these battles, and realize how many people u need to fit on the screen and all the calculations the game has to make, its pretty clear why it has to be optimized this way. Better game play is always more important than better graphics, and thats what this game delivers.I would say the hardest part about getting started is the interface and the definite language translation errors, but the interface is being updated with the new rome roll out. There is a unique troop upgrade system you need to do in order to gear yourself, which is quite confusing at first, but is kind of refreshing later on, because its different.This game is obviously very skill based, and it is unclear if either i just suck, or am experiencing latency issues but i get worked in duel mode. Which is odd because i usually finish 1st in command mode....Im around a t5 troop level, and it seems most people in this mode have all sorts of t8 gear, which is apparently balanced to t5 dmg, but i think these players have a ton of exp with other games like mount and blade, or chivalry because these guys dont play around. The PvP for me doesnt seem smooth, it seems rather choppy and unpredicatable at times, Id say I average 30fps and 87Ping, but im never looking at those #s during intense pvp, it seems to me like alot of hits do not register, and that some people have found a way to abuse gear - like i do not even see the animations for the Wu short sword half the time.Its unclear if more practice in the game will improve my results in pvp, but I really hope it does because this is a game I dont want to put down.As far as early access goes, I am unsure of what the developers want to do before it goes live, but i think they need a ton more maps, to increase the likiness of siege mode ( still havent played one) and obviously add a HUGE amount of PVE story missions, because currently they only have 1, we will be getting 1 more with the Rome update, but if I could play through many various battles from the three kingdoms peroid in this playstyle, I would be in heaven. I also think they need a game mode where clans can compete over cities like shogun2 or something and beable to defend and attack their towns. This would be epic but not quite sure how it would implemented. This game has so much potential and I hope the devs continue to roll out features. I would not want to see this game fail."
,Recommended,534500,29788941,Posted: 8 February,all,LukeSkyrata,"Great game! It's a very good hack and slash game, and you get your own squads of ai who accompany you through the battle. Think of a game with a mildly complex - as in, you have to actually aim and there are four directions of attack - melee system with ranged weapons like bows, crossbows, and javelins. Then throw in three different Chinese factions and recently a Roman faction. Finally, add tiered AI troops and their accompaning player equipment and boom - you get Tiger Knight. I love this game, and there is just so much love poured into it by the developers - something rare in a pay-to-play, much lest a free-to-play like Tiger Knight. There are some microtransactions available, and some DLC, but THIS IS BY NO MEANS PAY-TO-WIN! These merely speed up the research-unlock process (which, once you're good, takes little time because the only time needed put in for research is time actually playing) or unlock a handful of extra cosmetics or adjutants (essentially AI sidekicks which provide your AI unit with extra formations or other bonuses). There is just one problem:Matchmaking has issues. This is not a server issue, merely a balancing issue - albeit one which is considerably better after the rebalancing of the Rome update. The game is great, but you have different levels of troops (AI) and generals (players). So far as I can tell, outside of achievements and the gifts which come with them, the player levels mean nothing. However, your troops' level has a large effect on gameplay, higher level troops generally being better and having more abilities and weapon options. Also, you unlock better gear for yourself by leveling your troops. However, the game has a tendency to throw me in with players whose troops are way better than mine (for example, my level 2 Hastati vs their level 5 Principes). Since there are only about eight levels of infantry per faction and slightly less (because you get access to them at higher troop levels) for cavalry and archers or crossbowmen, there are fairly noticeable stat changes between troop levels. Thus, having even just a level lower of troops compared to an enemy can make a difference - much less the two or three level differences I have been stuck with repeatedly. NOTE: After the Rome update, this has been rebalanced; however, the fact that some matches I end up stuck with a team of level 1 troops with the enemies all level 3-5 troops is problematic, to say the least. Similarly, I have noticed a fair few players using high level gear with lower level troops. The game does scale down higher level gear to match your troop level, but this is only to a point - in other words, higher level gear is still better when you go with lower level troops. In other words - even though I'm not a bad player (on the occasion I don't get abandoned by my team or else have them wiped out before I can get to the fighting) I am constantly outmatched by people who oftentimes don't even seem very good. Their troops and weapons are, in comparison to mine.This game is not a bad game, in any way. As I said, matchmaking is slightly unbalanced. If you can work with that, (or if you are a veteran of other hack-and-slash or unconventional RTS) I heartily recommend this game."

76561198020601490,Not Recommended,534500,29631311,Posted: 1 February,all,Rawrzor,"Well after playing a bit over a 100 hours of the game it's time to write a review (which mind you i don't do all that often). Still i feel as this game is pretty much a rough gem that with some polish here and there could turn out to be great.So lets do some standard format shall we ?The pros:- Lu Bu is in the game, taking names and out of bubblegum.- Directional combat system.- China in medieval times (fight for wu,shu,wei and the romans)- Strategic use of troops giving it a bit of a moba/RTS-esque gameplay.- Tier up with new weapons, horses, units, adjutants and equipment.- 4 gamemodes including a PVE mode.- Unreal engine provides some decents graphics.- Once a unit has been unlocked you can use all the equipment that unit has for yourself.- Receptive of critique toward their game.- Last but not least, free 2 play and not pay 2 win.The cons:- New players often play with bots for the first tiers.- Can be pretty heavy on your PC. Optimization patches are being worked on.- The PVE mode is quite repetitive. They added a new map though so that already helps.- Weapon balance, tier balance, unit balance and overall matchmaking is ok, but far from perfect, again this is being worked on.- Relatively small player base.- 6v6 in command mode is pretty depended on how well your team plays and not so much depended on your actions.- No matchmaking. It will put full groups (6 man premades) vs pugs. 6v6 you are already depended on your team and this simply add oil to the flame.All in all for a EA (early access) game it's already pretty streamlined, which is not what i can say for every EA game i ever played (and god knows how many EA games i already played, we all did and felt the pain right ?). This one certainly does not disappoint in that regard. On top of that it's free so not much to loose there.If they can get some more ""end-game"" content going, some more gamemodes, more PVE ... well lets keep this short ... more of everything they already did sofar. Polish the preformance and balance, this game could go far. The base sofar is satisfying and entertaining.Disclaimer: I'm only T7 sofar and the game goes up to T8 for every one of the units so i'm nowhere near complete. Still i will update this reviews pros and cons if i find any later on.[Updated review 19-2-2017]although i did recommend this game before it switched after the roman update. The command mode which was 5v5 lost allot in the way of tactical play by being upgraded to 6v6. Giving the game more of a zerg feel then anything else.I still think the game has potential and this change actually appeals to allot of people. For me personally it became to much ""hope i get a good team"" then anything else, which is why i can't recommend it anymore.[Updated review 22-2-2017]The grouping system has been down ever since the roman update and it got fixed today. For they people actually grouping up this is a very welcome change however for everybody wanting to play this game solo it's a absolute nightmare.3-5 man premades running 2-3x cavalry units simply stomping all over pugs however they see fit. Also the game seems to not even attempt to matchmake groups, since every game it's always one side that has a premade.This game is in serious need of a solo/duo que. Anything upwards from that gives out too much advantage since the 6v6 relies pretty much only on teamwork and not so much personal skill."

While the enemy commanders can give you true fighting challenges, their Army are bots and it's your choice where to run at first.Good blend of strategy, tactics, weapon choice and your own personal skill with it all.Hopefully this gets long ongoing development with improvements but without changes to what is a great game already."
,Recommended,534500,29720332,Posted: 5 February,all,CodesMatodes,"Alot of fun, excited to see more content in the future.. really fun game where you are a general and you control a unit of troops, in 5v5 settings with each general having a unit of 15 or so troops to command or have follow him. Good mix of troop type, based on chinese dynasty. Rome will be added soon, that should be awesome. It has some PVE game modes where you seige a fort, and fight AI units together. It's really fun and addicted it takes alot of playtime to grind up the trees and tiers of troops, unless you want to spend money for gold like other free to play type games like this.. It's alot of fun if you liked dynasty warriors, and it has a similar combat mechanic to For Honor. You can have different weapons too, and equip a few that you can switch between, it has horses, and you can get bow and arrow, crowssbows, spears, swords and shields, axes, hammers, or even fishing boat paddles. It has different armor types for different styles of gameplay, and its sure to have a good fit for you. It will be great to see the community grow and more content added to the game and more gametypes maps and modes."

You can get enough resources for anything you want in just a few battles.Few things that are not so great are Chinese to Engish translations and voice narations, but, as I am not an native English speaker myself ... I don't really have any right to complain. Add a bit more polishing and this game will be 10/10"

I often see matches where one team has 3-4 heavy squads, sometimes even with heavy cavalry and 1-2 light squads while the other have 3-4 light squads. Frankly it is impossible for the team with more light squads to win if the heavy squad leaders play carefully. The maps are too small for light squads to ultilize their mobility and the marshals are too tanky for them to finish a sneak attack before the enemy come back. For now, heavy infantry and heavy cavalry for the win."

,Recommended,534500,29761158,Posted: 7 February,all,RusselR,"This game is totally AWESOME. My first, impression about this game is that it will be boring and just like any other strategy game I played. After I tried it, I realized that I was wrong. This game is different from the other game I played. You can be a commander of your own forces and lead them to victory. You only control the commander, so it is easy to move not worrying about your forces' movements 1 by 1. You can tell them to guard you, follow you and more. The action is very felt at the time that China has still warring states. The maps are also great and not boring. The graphics is incredible for a F2P game and the story is good. The main menu is very neat and I was able to manipulate it easily. Overall, it is a great game and a must-try for me."

And that just the latest one that made me decide to uninstall.Im not sure if its my computer or poor optimization, in fact im pretty sure its poor optimization because my computer can most things pretty well and with much greater asset counts and graphics, but this thing? ho ho ho no.I want to play this game so badly, I can easily see myself sinking several hundreds of hours into a game like this but I am done dealing with terrible performance like this.

TK has lots of potential and for the most part is alot of fun especially for F2P.Some great PVE content which is great because PVP can be difficult with low fps sometimes but overall the game is actually good now and hopefully only gets better, deserves support."
