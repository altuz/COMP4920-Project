She might've beat me today, but tomorrow I'll beat that score!Edit: Nominated this for ""Best Use Of A Farm Animal"" award..lol"

It is a simple concept and easy to understand. It is pretty physical so I caution if you have some serious physical pains and challenges. None-the-less it is worth $.99 for sure.The video below will be viewable soon. Check it out. Enjoy.https://youtu.be/TWpOm3Fk0oQAnother video with my wife playing with me:https://youtu.be/2zkqZeUwad8

You really do need to make sure you have your chaperone settings set up properly,  this game will throw tantalizing score giving crystals outside of your playspace,  you'll  just have to watch them pass you by and wait for the next ones.  Fun and fairly priced!"

Options to supersample in game is great.2. Fun concept and game play, makes u move3. potentially a good VR party game4. cheapCons: ( more like suggestions for improvement)1. some kind of BGM that u can turn on or off depending on your preferance would be nice (ex: bgm in out of ammo)2. Longer hammer would make the hammering process less frustrating. At the moment, hammering things a way has very high chance of collision which makes it almost not worth the effort to hammer thnigs away.3. Need a Global& local score board !All my suggestions aside, i think this game is definitely worth $1 for anyone who is considering it."

I highly recommend you buy this game and show it to your friends, and come on, it's practiaclly free! If I could have one humble request for the dev, please let us have a slow-mo mode, or even better, a way to activate slow motion at will. We could be dodging buffalos like Neo :D"

Only thing I would like is different hammers or tools to use to hit things with. Even if its just gag items.10/10 Would hear ""OH GOD A BUFFALO"" again"

Best game I have brought for the Vive under $5 and this one is under $1.Some thoughts:Would like a time trial included see how long you can dodge.See your score while you playHave Helen Hunt as some of the debris as I've always wanted to swat her out of the way and you can rename game ""Tornuffalo Hunt""More items that you can use to hit the crystals and debris, something like chainsaw, shield, crow bar, massive axe etcGlobal and friend scoresAnyway hope you stick with it as its a great little game, one of my favs and I've already gifted a couple of copies to help get the word out."

,Not Recommended,534720,26164306,"Posted: 22 October, 2016",all,Arduous Wolf,"I really don't want to give this a thumbs down as I can see the potential fun to be had with this game and the price is right.However the potential to break either your controllers, lights or TV if you have a smaller playspace is just far too great. In the 10 minutes that I played this game I hit my treadmill four times and my light fixture three times, even though I have a bigger play space then  required at 3mx1.8m.The trouble is that the objects you have to hit to score points often either fly far overhead encouraging you to jump (I swear some were actiually higher then my ceiling height), or fly far to the left or right and past your chaperone bounds encouraging you to swing past the bounds in the heat of the moment.If you have a big playspace with a lot of room for error around your boundries, then pick this up as it's definitely worth its price tag. However if you don't have the luxury of any extra space, it is probably best to avoid this one (along with any potential repair bills) until such a time that these issues are addressed."

,Recommended,534720,28879172,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,xAirrick,"Addictive game play.  You can't just stop at one game.   Great value at $1BEWARE: the gems appear outside of the play area boundary.  It's a game within a game trying to get the gems with doing any physical damage to the controller, wall, tv, gf, etc.   Don't let your friends play as they will surely swing wildly at the gems outside of the play area.  Unless of course you have a really big play area, then let them go wild and film it so we can all laugh."

So when I finally have 30 minutes I certainly do not want to spend it on this game.-Nevertheless it might be nice to show to friends who just needs a quick 1-2 minutes entertainment with easy control. I guess you can put your grand mom to play this game and she will immediately know how it works which is not the case with other more advanced games...For the price of 1 euro it is certainly worth to support the developers."
,Recommended,534720,31366698,Posted: 25 April,all,RadicaLee,"Full body tracking gave me that first time VR feeling all over again. I used the 3 tracker setup, and the immedaite WOW factor of seeing my whole body tracked was nuts. Shortly into the gameplay, I realized how much I had been ignoring my lower body in VR before this (such as in Space Pirate and RecRoom). My foot placement is now critical to the gameplay and my survival, forcing me to have more body awareness which automatically increases the immersion.Overall, Tornuffalo is worth a dollar, and the tracker support adds to the gameplay quality in a significant way.I bought the trackers for my own development purposes as well, so if you are not a developer, there is no rush in buying trackers."

If you want to be Thor, and play around with all the Vive toys, this is a showcase game.  Good party fun with multiple game modes.Be a good VR boy and buy it immediately."
76561198067724994,Recommended,534720,33554508,Posted: 15 July,all,Jabool,"I feel like this game is a bit of a hidden gem, it's not something you will likely get 10+ hours out of, but it is easily more than worth the price, you could check under your couch for some loose change and then get yourself a fun and unique VR experience. I am personally fond of the big hammer mode because it makes me feel like a badass. I feel like this isn't a title people need to be hesitant on, it's 99 cents, if you are worried you can't afford it then why do you have a VR system?"
,Recommended,534720,29307076,Posted: 16 January,all,Bird Person,Its pretty fun and i like the bonas modes. Its a must buy for a dollar.
,Recommended,534720,29785540,Posted: 8 February,all,Syrsly,"Tornuffalo is a good cheapie to start your VR collection.Tornuffalo has one major feature that most VR games still do not have: IK arms.  Well, it has a single arm, anyway.  This feature is implemented so well that it's a selling point of getting this game.  For 99 cents, it's worth experiencing.  It's also replayable thanks to the arcade style score-driven gameplay.  That said, the gameplay is mostly just breaking gems and avoiding everything else.This is a stationary game that requires roomscale, meaning that you don't get locomotion sickness from it, because the only way to move is to actually move your real body.  You can't, however, jump over obstacles.  You're limited to ducking, strafing left and right, and using your hammer to make objects go around or over you."
