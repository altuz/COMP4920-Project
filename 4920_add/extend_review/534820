You're really not fooling anyone, shady devs. If you have something to say, do it publicly not through fake reviews.Do not be fooled by the screenshots, this is not a LoL clone, this is a Dota2 clone. The game has no redeeming features on PC. This is an acceptable mobile version of Dota2 that SHOULD HAVE STAYED ON MOBILE DEVICES.There was no thought put into the port of this game. You can't play the game in English if you're from Europe. I played the game before it came out on Steam and I was at least expecting that to change, but they put literally 0 work into it.I suggest the creators putting in the bare minimum of work if they want this to work on Steam, but honestly, while this game is acceptable on mobile where you're competing with games of an overall lower quality, it's just trash on PC."

Every character I looked at - both visually and gameplay-wise - was a cheaply made version of an existing hero/champion in DotA/LoL.Every character has access to the same set of abilities that have pretty big effects, like resetting the teleport cooldown, or making towers practically invincible. The cooldown of these abilities can be reduced by paying for VIP status. So...yea. Pretty big advantage you get in a ""competitive"" game via paying real money.Some various issues I encountered in 2 matchmade games:Atrocious UIBad pathfindingNo EU English servers (have to play on NA with high ping or in another language)Glyphs give advantages to higher level players (like runes in League), wouldn't be so much of a problem except:Bad matchmaking. In my first game, the other players had glyphs, I didn't. Enemies had twice my health at the start. Very fun.Doing anything, from opening the shop to moving to using abilities feels laggy, beyond the ping.Characters that I think are only unlockable via VIP status, which has levels to it.If you were curious about this game, like I was, give it a go. It's the game equivalent of one of those really cheesy, terrible 70s B-movies, except no where near as good. Then never play it again.I'll say this though: I'm impressed the game is only like 50mb. Considering the size, it doesn't look/sound completely atrocious. That really is the only positive about the game, though.Oh, and to add, does anyone remember who you play in the tutorial of League of Legends? It's Ashe. Who do you play in the tutorial of Heroes Evolved? Well, they have 3 out of 4 abilities the exact same as Ashe...Made me chuckle."

It also rips off of World of Warcraft.Anyone who has a memory in better working condition than a 80 year old meth addict would instanstly observe that the whole art is shamelessly copied from actual sucessful MOBAs. If you take a quick look at the heroes you will also notice striking similarities. The difference is the name of the heroes and the art. But what is this? The sound is the same? How could this be? What are the chances that a game in the same genre uses the same heroes with the same sounds only with a little bit different art.Now to the World of Warcraft part. The hero ""Minos"" who happens to be a minotaur (very clever) has 2 skins . One is the a exact copy of the colour scheme used for Alistair in League of Legends. But he has another epic skin. an armored one.Here is the skin how it is displayed on the shop:http://imgur.com/a/x4BxmAnd here is the WoW one                                   :https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JiQXoKoB6Jk/maxresdefault.jpgArtistic ingenuity meets a glitch in the matrix? Or a just a lazy asian company with greedy greasy fingers who cannot in their lifetime create original ideas even if their life depended on it. Gulag life is hard.And to top it all off:It's pay to win. If you can upgrade ""Summoner Spells"" (call them that for now) with real money because you have a ""VIP"" status. Then the game is pay to win. Instant rezz? BAM! Lower cooldown thanks to highly difficult skill called money!Runepages? Neat. Runes? Neat, but wait! You lost a match? Oh oh, you just lost durability on those runes, a couple more losses and BAM you need to buy more of them!You like loot? How about loot chests?! BAM! The lock requires you to buy a key to open one before you can gamble away! INGENIOUS!Oh yeah and don't forget all the pro player that buy only 1 health potion and blame the hero they are playing that they underperform and add that you only play fps games. Great community. IQ and Age not in the double digits? Feel at home this is the place for you. Where mouthbreathing is done easily in the company of casual pigs. All hail the extreme end of the austistic spectrum.

,Not Recommended,534820,29467064,Posted: 24 January,all,<™[-=> Cookiez <=-]™>,"Nope, super Pay To Win game. Heroes Evolved is basically a mish mash of Dota and League of Legends. The objective is like any other MOBA, destroy the enemy's main tower before they destroy yours. The map is similar to Dota with the textures and skins looking like League of Legends. The skills are similar to League of Legends with skills scaling with the items you buy but there is a 5th option of adding stats, which is similar to Dota before 7.00. The game is a blatant ripoff of League of Legends with skills such as vision, double tapping B to free teleport back to base. For Dota, tower invulnerability and instant buyback. The absolute worst thing about this game is the VIP status. If you pay cash, all the abilities that I just mentioned can be given preferential cooldowns. It's so bad.There is a super cash shop with the cash currency called gems. The best price was $200 for 20,000 Gems. Each hero can cost up to 810 gems.Conclusion, don't play Reality Squared/R Squared games. They have a reputation for making a game just to squeeze out as much money as they can from it and dump it. Jared/Jason Psigoda, an American, is actually behind this blatant ripoff. You'd think that an American would stop Chinese ripoffs.PROS1. You Made Another MOBAAt least you made one.CONS1.

In ASS♥♥♥♥♥♥S genre, this boss would be Peasants Evolved:he.r2games.comThey say, that the game is ""competitive"" and can be downloaded in 10 seconds (and it is truth, the full clients weights only 80 MB, and the graphics is not awful; I think the only plus of the game). I played this game like for 50 hours (hopefully I didn't spend any real money on the game), so let me count all the sins that this game, it's developers and publishers have commited:They have not only expensive heroes andevent-only heroes that are earned by like 10 people per event, but they also have premium heroes, that you can't get without spending real money!They have pre-game setups, like runes system, that is a complete garbage, because if in LoP you have 30 runes and 3 of them give you badass stats, then in Peasants Evolved you have 9 simple runes. However, you need them because depending on your ""rune level"" you can choose masteries, that give you big power ups such as +15% tower damage.They have ranked-only queue, even for ARAM, which means that ranked becomes non-competitive, because different players have different amount of runes.They copied heroes from LoP and DotA, and that are not totally copied have copied skills.They totally copied items from LoP and DotA.They copied map from 6.81 DotA.And finally, they made one of the worst gameplay design that I ever saw: instead of runes they have a jungle monster, and you can't know what buff will be dropped out of him before this monster would be slain; instead of Roshan we have Zakar, that is extremelly hard to beat and he gives like 30 attack damage and 20 spell damage, so nobody even touches him; there are no junglers or roamers, but trio lanes are stupid, so even on pro scene they go 2-1-2 laning each game; hero balance is horrible, I don't even want to talk about it, just trust me, I was Silver I there before I left this game.1.

Same map, similar heroes/champs, etc. But unfortunately, the game is lacking in the quality department. It's missing the polish of League or DotA. Also, the runes system is god-awful. Durability on runes makes no sense. And I'm not sure, but it seems like they match you against bots, because my team stomped 6 in a row. Not to mention the VIP system which allows you to basically reduce the timer on things akin to Glyph in DotA or a refresh on your League Teleport. Pay to win at its finest. And the graphics look okay considering it took me literally less than a second to install the game. Not to mention the community is twice as toxic as League's and Dota's combined. Wouldn't recommend, but it could be fun if every MOBA server goes down and you have nothing better to do. Actually, in that case, just play Adventure Time Battle Party. You'll have a better time."
,Not Recommended,534820,29667440,Posted: 3 February,all,Daikenkini,"Pay2Win unlike you have ever seenThe game is fun indeed. However the quality of champion design is inconsistent and atrocious. The pay2win system effects your gameplay at all times, since the stone active abilities (comparable to summoner spells from League of Legends) become much stronger the further you advance on a VIP Ladder, making spending money on this game as you progress unavoidable lest you want to continue. It's not a question of if this will lead to a dreadful experience for the average nonspending player - it's just a question of when. And once the realization sets in, it will hit you hard. And the more you had played before finally hitting that paywall, the harder it will hit you.Not recommended, although it can be fun when you're playing it drunk and/or on a lanparty."
,Not Recommended,534820,29466806,Posted: 24 January,all,EvilMorty,"I don't mind if it's a League's or DotA's clone, I mean, HoN is an obvious DotA clone, but it's really fun. I played Heroes Evolved for like 100 games before it was released in steam, but not because the game is good, but because I was tired of DotA, LoL, Vainglory, HoN and other lane-pushing games, so I wanted to try something new, and I found this. This game is an absolute disaster of lane-pushing game genre, and there is three major reasons to it:1.Balance and design. Stupid hero design that looks like a random mix of model, stats and abilities from LoL and DotA (imagine a ranged tank with Gyrocopter's rockets and Ziggs' ulti - welcome to Heroes Evolved, we have this thing), and ofc these designs can't be balanced - heroes in this game are either overpowered or underpowered. Buff in the jungle is random, boss is very powerful and gives like 30 AD, so nobody kills him, bad jewels (runes) system that I don't even want to talk about - it's that bad! I would even say that this game's design is the worst of all lane-pushing games.2.Moneymaker. Imagine the game, where your in-game currency receiving is equal to LoL's, but heroes that are 65% more expencive, but not only that - there are also premium heroes that you can't get without paying real money, and also event-only heroes, that are achieved by like 5 people per event. Yeah, welcome to Heroes Evolved.3.Casuality. It's that case when both teams are bad at this game, and with no actual comeback system it's so easy to solo carry games, that before Bronze III I had 95% win rate for 20 games! And you know why? BECAUSE THERE IS NO UNRANKED!!! Yeah, you're just forced to go ranked WITH NO CALIBRATION SYSTEM, and that means that Bronze I in this game is basicly a pre-10th level in LoL! Do you think that on high ranks there are good players? Well, I watched a Diamond III carry's stream, and what I saw is a carry that misses like half of his farm! Of course, punching kids is fun when you do this for first 10 times, but when you do it for 50 times it gets kinda boring! This game really has so low skill cap that a 3 years old child can play this game!Just imagine: this game is alive, but Dawngate is closed; this game was released, but The Godlike wasn't released; this game is in China, America, Middle Asia, Europe, but Realm of the Titans is only avaible in China; this game is released in Steam, but Paragon is not; this game already has it's mobile version, but Rise of Winterchill still has no standalone game - these facts make me REALLY upset. This game kills lane-pushing genre. Don't play this game, even if you are a really low skill player, just spend some time to learn LoL or DotA and play a quality lane-pushing game."

The pay2winmodel is surpisingly not as bad as League of Legends and you can actually get any gem-only item by selling your Treasures if you pay enough. I've only made 28 gems (28 cents) doing this from about 3-4 weeks of playing.There are very few original characters but enough are familiar from LoL and DotA 2 but slightly tweaked in that ""I wonder if X had Y"" way that may make it enjoyable for a time.Jane is pretty cool.There are definitely some downsides to this game and they've probably been mentioned to death.P2W - Not as bad as LoL despite what some people say, the VIP system only shaves a minute or so off the VIP skills they are available to pretty much everyone unless you ♥♥♥♥ up with your gold from the first month.Lag - I know there are a LOT of BRs, so maybe it's them commenting this but I've had no lag, the servers can sometimes ♥♥♥♥ up but that was twice I saw problems within the 6 weeks or so I've played with 2 friends, never had bad lag problems, at all.Quality inconsistency - It's definitely there, but no shock LoL had this problem for years (♥♥♥♥ing triangle feet).LoL 'clone' - Calling games clones in such a small genre is quite silly, I've heard games like Dawngate and Strife called clones despite being so different, this isn't even a point to make to be honest. Most of the obvious kits have already been made in one of the 3-4 major mobas, so expect them in almost each one, and you can usually find some variations of them in each one.BR community is a MAJOR deficit, there are quite a few trolls and they aren't kept in check, the inability or just unwilllingness to speak in English is quite annoying. This is a huge problem on the NA server and if they just put in a BR server it would be great but they don't have the playerbase for it so... big shock! This is a problem in DotA2 as well and somewhat in LoL last I played them a few years back though so again... no shock to see it in a moba."

With that being the case, getting in and learning the roster, store, and map can be enjoyable.  It basically seems to combine the good from DOTA and LoL to give MOBA fans something new.   What is out now is a good start."

,Not Recommended,534820,29551093,Posted: 28 January,all,Zeko,"I saw a video on youtube and thought that it looked good, a combo of LoL and DotA's best parts....but they did not only take the best parts, they also took one of the BAD parts...GREED.PROThere are a few skills which are probably same for every player in the game (summoner skills in LoL)and you get them all in every game. They are summoning the shop to yourself on lane, revive, teleport cooldown reset(teleport has 90 sec cooldown), movement speed boos(looks actually cool, you ride a horse around), building fortification(from DotA) and revealing a small area on the map.CONYou can use real money to BUY some cooldown for them.I was going into this open minded but this is clearly a rip off with only 1 intent, to make money.GAMEPLAYThe lane,the fights and the turrets felt more like DotA than LoL except you cannot deny creeps. I think LoL has more clarity between heroes and creeps and that makes it more enjoyable. This is more of a DotA copy than a LoL overall. Snowballing is far too easy, at the end of my game i was 10 levels ahead of everyone and even though my team was losing fights hard 4v5 (4 of them died for nobody) I would still kill every single one of the enemy..maybe Flavia is just OP?Also my ping was at a constant 133. I am from Croatia."

Others and myself have written on the forums and no dev's have gotten back to anyone and nothing has been done to fix the issue. There is a ""fix"" of downloading their actual client and then pasting the installed files within the game's steamapp folder; however, you cannot access your account that you play on steam. Until this issue is fixed, I will not be recommending this game to anyone._Feb 12th, 2017_Played plenty of MOBAs such as League of Legends, DOTA 2, Smite, Heroes of the Storm, Paragon, Vain Glory, and the mobile version of this very game. People who are complaining about it being a clone of some sort must not play a lot of MOBAs, as all MOBAs pretty much copy eachother while trying to accomplish something that sets themselves apart. This game borrows some similarities from Dota 2 & League of Legends, yes... but that's just MOBAs being MOBAs.The game downloads, starts, and runs just fine. The gameplay runs pretty well. I wouldn't say the controls are as fluid as League, but equal to Dota (totally imo; take it how you want). I'm pretty happy to see a wider selection of heroes to play in comparison to the mobile game. I am wondering why Nheza is not in this game though.VIP benefits unlocks♥♥♥♥♥♥for your money, BUT this game does not hit a P2W climate. You just have to work less to unlock♥♥♥♥♥♥you could otherwise unlock with just putting time in- just like any other MOBA. So it's moreso Pay2GrindLess. Being a free game, that's acceptable.So far, I like the PC version like I do the mobile version. Looking forward to playing some more matches when the time permits me to do so. No reason for you all not to give a shot: not like you'll lose money in doing so."
