,Recommended,535150,30913532,Posted: 2 April,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"This game is so frustrating; there’s no save feature at the beginning (meaning that one little mistake, it’s over, you have to start all over again), you gotta keep replaying the game all the time to save the CGs in the gallery, and there’s the dad. The man is EVERYWHERE, he even shows up at two different places at the same time.Despite its flaws, I enjoyed “Busted!” more than I expected. Yes, it’s hard and unfair, but I liked that aspect? It would be great if the developers could add an “easy mode” for others to enjoy this title as well, but I gotta say, it’s been a while since I’ve played such a challenging game. When you’re almost there, just a block away from clearing the level, the dad shows up and you’re busted. It will make your blood boil for sure after 5 times in a row. If you want a “different challenge”, I definitely recommend this game on a sale. But if you don’t like getting angry or getting frustrating, this game might not be for you.5/10. I had lots of mixed feelings while playing this, from having tons of fun to suddenly wanting to smash something because dad caught me looking at anime beewbs or running out of time (yes, there’s a time limit). I enjoyed the challenge tho."

,Not Recommended,535150,29075723,Posted: 6 January,all,Azure Nova,"Difficulty curve starts off too high, not enough reward to justify the risk, and bad AI management make this too stressful to be really worth it.  Where do i even begin to elaborate?-Right away, you'll notice on the first level, the ""dad"" comes in several times from the same spot and spots open up way too frequently. There is no difficulty settings or ramp up, the only changes are a few new spots for the ""dad"" to come in through with the frequency staying the same. You'll spend more time stressing over false positives than actually progressing. And lets mention how the first level bricks take 3 hits to break. Go ahead, take a look at the screen shot and count the number of bricks covering the picture, i'll wait. And it only gets worse from there!-The basic frame of the game is you try to break blocks and expose pictures of PG13-at-worst anime girls and if you get caught you lose EVERYTHING. If you quit after a day you save the pictures you've unlocked up to that point and have to start all over, but witht he aformentioned difficulty being so high, you'll likely never get past the 3rd level before the paranoia causes you to lose focus. If there were some way to get value out of the pictures you have to pass again and again to reach new ground, it would be worth it. but as it stands, the risk isnt worth the reward.-Absolutely nothing is explained in enough detail with this game's mechanics outside of ""break blocks, dont get caught."" It's enever explained what the clock timer is for, what the stars mean, or if there are bad things to do that would increase the difficulty. all of that is guess work and what you have to go to the discussion forums for. Unacceptable!-To expand on a few earlier pointsm it takes a long time to break all of the blocks on even the first screen, so you'll have to invest in an auto-clicker program to avoid breaking your mouse. And the details of the game are incredibly deceptive, nearing false advertising boundries. nothing in this game is ""censored"", none of the pictures have anything exposed and there isnt even an external patch to expose more.-Speaking of developers, it seems like the dev of this particular ""game"" has just dumped this off and left. there is no support on the discussion boards from the devs or any sort of interaction.In closing, This sad excuse of a rip-off of Gamer form Wario Ware is nothing special. Don't let the ""overall positive"" reviews confuse you, there are a lot of thirsty 13 year olds who will give good reviews on the promise of anime porn. It's not even close to semi-roguelike and being ""frantic"" is not a good thing."

If you lose a level, you have to start from Level 1. If you want to save the pics you've uncensored to the gallary, you have to restart from Level 1.If lv 3 is the lv I'm having trouble with, I want to play lv 3 without playing lv 1 and 2 to get there.It turns what is a fun and interesting game, into a complete waste of time."

It also teaches us the hardships of living in a surveillance state.Call it my bad taste if you want, but I just love the idea the game is based on. I only wish that they would make an official 18+ patch that makes the pictures more... ahem... worthy of hiding them from the dad.It's comprehensible that they had to make the pictures less kinky, because Steam would not allow the game to be published otherwise. But that's the reason why such official patches exist in the first place. So that the users can apply them AFTER they have downloaded the game from Steam in order to get the full experience and play the game the way it's actually intended to be played.And Steam does not seem to have any problem with the existence of such patches als long as Steam doesn't have to distribute them.I mean if you're just gonna torture us like that (with a constant fear of loosing all the progress at any possible second) then at least give us something good to look at. Something that is worth all that suffering.Damn does my finger hurt. It's not what you're thinking. I just had to click like crazy only to loose all my progress at level 5 because the time ran out."

The End.Yes, it's a game for perverts. Yes, it's a formula that's been done before. However, BUSTED! is just so ridiculously stupid that it's a blast to play. Why is your father hiding in the attic? Why is he in your wardrobe? Because he's your father, dammit, that's why.If you're looking for a game to fill the void that your open-world RPG left, this game is not for you. If you're looking for a stupid silly game to waste a lazy Sunday on, why not play BUSTED!?"
,Not Recommended,535150,33596177,Posted: 16 July,all,AnimeEDM,the game is awful not even worth it if it was free.basicly a click and hide screen game you can get from browser games. the game is not even lewd in any way. if the developers think this is lewd then hope is lost for future games.dont forget it gets stupidly hard i could not get past day 4 cause every 4 seconds 'dad' pops up i dont even have time to open the damn thing. since i played this for too long i can not return it wich is a shame cause this is bad BEYOND BADALSO FOR WHO IS INTERESTED NO TRADING CARDS OR WHATEVER I DONT THINK IT HAS ACHIEVMENTS TOO ITS JUST RANDOM CRAP ACCEPTED BY STEAM.

,Recommended,535150,26112983,"Posted: 19 October, 2016",all,Ohagi-Chan,"Quite fun, very exhilirating!A lot of people complain that this game doesn't save your progress until you manually quit, and that leaving the gameplay for any reason will put you back to the start. While those are valid points that do make the game more frustrating, those people have obviously never played reveal-the-picture games before; that stuff is kind of the standard for this style of game...Also, get an auto-clicker and set it to 10 times per second. The game is a lot more fun to play if you only have to worry about guiding your mouse rather than going half delirious with clicking cramp on top of the jumping at shadows that this game requires you to do. I say 10 times per second because much faster (I tried with 50 times per second) and the game reaches its max projectiles on screen simultaneously and it looks awkward when you're shooting burst-fire boobies at the blocks.Play this game with headphones on, not because you necessarily need to keep the SE and BGM in, but because you really need to be able to hear all of the SE cues really well.Fifth night, ninja-dad is F*ing freaky!"
