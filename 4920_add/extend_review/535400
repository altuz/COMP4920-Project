,Not Recommended,535400,25964706,"Posted: 10 October, 2016",all,Howling Wind,"The game is interisting, the pixel art is really good, but it's poorly executed.Basically, I can point two major flaws:1) As a pont-and-click adventure, you have to get items to interact with your surroundings and solve the puzzles. It's fine and dandy. But in order to get said items, you have to know that you need them. For example, you have to break a wall, you need a sledgehammer; until you know that you have to break the wall, you can't pick the sledgehammer even if you find it. It makes sense for a number of reasons (people don't stuff themselves with random items and from a gameplay point of view it prevents players from using the knowledge from previous playthroughs to directly going to the item), but it's very rigid and sometimes even ridicolous. It also makes very difficult to understand what are you gonna need for your quest and what's just a background element, since it's not always based on common sense and you have to follow the exact mental track of the developers. Furthermore, it keeps making you go back and forth, stretching the limited game setting with tedious backtracking... There's a total lack of level design here2) For the horror part, you have to keep your heart rate low, balancing items to relax yourselves with the scares you'll get while exploring. However, some of them are fixed (you can't avoid getting an increase in the heart rate because you need to do a specific action, kinda unfair for the player), some of them happen randomly based on RNG elements... Some of them can be avoided (for example, avoid a certain spot, but it's all knowledge from previous playthroughs), but other seem to have no rhyme or reason. You just get them. And since you can die from them, it's really frustrating when you get them in chain just because. Maybe I'm the one that can't find a way to avoid them, but even then it's all about getting in the developers mind scheme since it's not intuitive. So yeah, you can die despite your best efforts and be forced to replay the whole 'back and forth to get items in the correct order' riveting game mechanic. Also, it's hardly to be scared from pixel art, the scare jump effect is quickly neutralizedSo yeah, there's some good in this game, but it's ruined from major gameplay flaws that makes it annoying and frustrating. It would have been better if it were more a story than a game (no heart rate mechanic, for example), just following the clues and leave to the player the fact of being scared.It's not terrible, but it fails in being truly enjoyable. There are worst ways to spend 3 dollars, for its price it's still quite good, but its flaws are big and penalize the gaming experience"
,Not Recommended,535400,25916975,"Posted: 7 October, 2016",all,Terran,"This is a much better purchase than a 50-use spray tag on a certain game we all know of.However, I cannot recommend this simply due to how obviously irritating the ""Spook"" mechanic is. If your heart rate goes over 70, then you die. Going into certain areas, or using certain objects triggers ""Spoops"" that will cause your heart rate to increase. I found but three ways to lower this; Beer in the building at the pier, a sedative in the bathroom and playing the old record on the gramophone in the attic. Otherwise, as a whole, this game is simply a trial-and-error virtually point-and-click sans the clicking. Interesting, but not interesting enough. Refunding it would be cruel, however, so I won't, since the game will probably entertain me in the future, but I'm still not going to recommend it.Of course, if the features/systems in this game match your strike zone, then by all means it is worth the $2."

Upon loading this, it is very easy to see that the developers native language is NOT English. That's fine and all, except for the fact that the whole game is riddled with broken English. ""Empty the trash""? Really? You mean ""an empty trash can"". ""Drawer of the tool inside""? I think you meant ""there is a tool inside the drawer. Most of the text looks like terrible Google translations copied and pasted into the game.On to the ""horror"". I am the BIGGEST wuss when it comes to horror games. THE BIGGEST. So when I say this wasn't eerie or scary at all, I mean it.***Slight Beginning-of-game SPOILER***When I read ""Rebecca Diary"" (more broken English) and got to the end, a super subtle ghostly image of what I presume to be her appeared, then disappeared. It was so lackluster, it was insulting. Then my hair turned gray and I died. WTF?***SPOILER END***I love pixelated-graphics horror adventures, but this is easily one of the worst. If you want good ones, look more towards The Last Door, Lone Survivor, and hell, even Uncanny Valley blows this away.Steer clear of this TRASH!"

But the big annoying issue is that some objects works only in a specific conditions in a limited amount of time and if you fail one time you risk to scew up the entire game progress.Also there are multiple ending but this does not make any sense, because you have to do exactly the same operations for the 95% of the game progress, that is very mechanical, it feels like a job routine.So, if you want, give it a try, the price is very cheap and it works without problems, but the game design doesn't fit very well in my opinion, expecialy for a game that has been designed to easily kill the player."

The only thing I would say needs to be altered is to have an option for different resolutions. When it's full screen it's kind of hard to read some of the stuff, because it's blown up. But, this is worth the 3 bucks, check out the video for a few minutes of gameplay and stuff.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2dJXWweOxw&feature=youtu.be"
,Not Recommended,535400,34245793,Posted: 14 August,all,Detrian,"Wandering about on a timer, seeing if you can find items/clues to activate other points of interest. Biggest flaw is that you cannot pick up most items without other stuff telling you they are useful, creating a ton of backtracking that can kill you and force you to start over. Fullscreen doesn't seem to work either. Not fun, not scary, not recommended."

That's not a strike against it, however, as the subtle things that happen all around you, or in the background, will keep you on edge the entire time!Check out my video here for some first-glance opinions of the game, as well as some tips if you get stuck in the puzzles (Like the safe or the password ones specifically!):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDnkMtmfzOk"

Surprisingly few moments for a pure puzzle game where the logic seems to come out of nowhere, and very little in the way of ""rub every item on everything until something works.""  It can definitely be challenging, though.Edit: While some have noted frustration on the poor translation of the game into English, I found it always possible to tell what the author meant, though perhaps that comes from working with Russian speakers in the past."

What makes the game good is the atmosphere of the house, but if you get too stressed, you'll die and have to start over. There is no save feature, so if you die or leave the game, you HAVE to start over. For $3, you can't go wrong."

There were times that I had no choice but to die because I didn't know what to do, so there was some trial and error in the playthrough. I didn't expect the game to scare me that much but there were some times that it was unnerving, having to see your health decrease (or rather, your heart rate increase) suddenly, or the battery life of my flashlight tick down to zero and scrambling to find an extra battery in the process.Very interesting storyline as well. I played it multiple times just for the achievements and the different endings (which was a big reason for its replayability). 4/5 I highly recommend it."

On one hand, its got some decent pixel art, a haunting atmosphere and it even manages some genuinely competent horror, somthing that so many other games fail to achieve. Its not without its flaws, wnadering back and forth can be tedious, an emphasis on multiple playthroughs ruins many attempts to scare the player and the interactive elements are very shallow.A more in depth analysis can be found here:https://unproductivesod.com/2016/10/30/review-breathing-fear"

,Recommended,535400,32656351,Posted: 22 June,all,LookSHa,"It's fine game. Nothing extra, but not bad. Price pretty much equals experience. The only thing I don't like about this game are the endings... You have to do only one different thing(at the end), which(for me) is not much satisfying"
,Recommended,535400,33076813,Posted: 1 July,all,wyulf,"despite the pixel art, there are some 'moments' in breathing fear that will get you all the same.while the basic mechanics and controls are very simple, the player may start off feeling very lost. there will be plenty of trial and error early on (if you dont resort to a guide), and you'd have to slowly feel your way around for quite a bit before you have an inkling of a good and proper sequence of doing things, in order to move forward.from there on, it does get a bit interesting, finding out the back story of the house, but yet, despite the multiple endings, it might get repetitive a bit fast, as it all requires you to do mostly the same things over and over, and the only steps that matter, are the ones you take close to the end. thankfully, it's a fairly short process once you know what to do and where to do.but all that being said, for a very low price, it's a fairly decent horror-ish adventure that might kill a few hours of your time (if you want to see the multiple endings).p.s. i see many reviews that complained about the broken english, but kudos to the developer for taking note as well, and rectifying the issue for the most parts now."
