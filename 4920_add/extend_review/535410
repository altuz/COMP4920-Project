The dev is super responsive, is patching every bug we wrote and following community suggestions. The game itself it's still WIP, but yet very enjoyable, and the price is super fair as I expected for the full game with the campaign at least 15-20$ (it's not a wave shooter, it's a roomscale RTS like Homeworld). The interface is growing patch after patch, but I would say than zoom or drag a whole space battlefield with your own hands is yet gorgeous.At the moment 20/20 positive review here, let's give our support to this project."

Though could use some polishFirst RTS game on the Vive that has a great sense of scale. Its aweing to see ships duke it out from the bridge of your capitol ship.Pros:Skirmish Mode with varying difficultiesVery intuitive controls, was very easy to get pick up and play.Absolutely massive sense of scale.Variety of Ships with different roles and attributesActive Dev.Cheap!ConsSound FX, Music could use some work.While the ship models are beautiful, the visual effects (explosions) could use an update.Some Performance issues in some of the larger battles.Pathfinding needs a lot of work. Ships will often collide with each other and don't seem to maintain formations.Overall this is an excellent start. I enjoyed this game and look forward to more."

I like that you can use roomscale or choose to stand/sit with no disadvantages. The game just needs more to do in the campaign and skirmishes but I've no doubt it's coming."

However, it falls short of reaching the goal line.With only three skirmish maps (all of which appear to be the same with different backgrounds) and five difficulty settings, CapitalShip VR is missing the rest of the recipe for a great game. And as an RTS, it falls flat on it's face as the strategy is simply making as many miners as possible and overwhelming the fleet; The AI does little to respond to your assaults.Controls are not very intuitive and the tutorial does little to alleviate the confusion. The game promises that you can make formations but it seems each time I have tried the ships just kind of move toward the enemy, at their own paces and not as a formation. Selecting and deselecting ships doesn't seem very natural as the selection is done with a sort of cone and you tend to grab the wrong ships or clusters of ships that you don't want to move. On that, ships tend to crash into each other without even attempting to avoid collision. And yes, they appear to take crash damage.Combat is somewhat lackluster. I have no indication of how damaged the enemy ships are until they explode in a disappointing boom. Carriers, when told to move, seem to leave their strike craft behind. This can cause issue when you issue an attack command and the tiny attackers have to traverse the entire map in order to get to their target.The name of the game is CapitalShip. Yet the actual capital ship doesn't really portray that. The larger craft such as the cruisers and carriers are almost as large and the miner ships are much larger than the capital ship itself.Even with the above issues, Capitalship VR does deliver on several fronts. The ships themselves seems varied, each with a particular function and the ships are very well detailed and look stunning. I found myself pausing the action just to move the camera around the ships to take a good look at each one. The detail is all there and you can even make out the menus on the bridge of the capital ship. Very cool!I cannot stress how friggin' cool it is to issue commands to the fleet, and watch the action take place from the bridge, overshadowed by Jupiter and its moon, Europa. It truly is one of the coolest things you can do in a video game.All in all, the developers need to take a look at successful space RTS games, chiefly, Homeworld. It had a sense of purpose and strategy. Both sorely lacking in CapitalShip VR. At the time of writing this the game is still early access and the developers need to take a good look at the best ways to improve this game because they are sitting on a gold mine, a real treasure that can push the forefront of both VR and RTS."

There's really nothing else like it right now. SOme impressive graphics and unique control systems. I can't wait to see where it goes from here.

If nothing else, this should be a proof-of-concept for ""Space VR RTS's"" in general, due to the intuitive nature of directing ships across any plane of movement with the hand controllers."

The dev has been very helpful and has fixed a few of the bugs i pointed out within hours of posting them.  The controls are simple and easy to pick up.

I think it would be worth the price even if all you could do is view the models in VR.  But you actually get to deploy and control them in battle.  Rudimentary at the moment, but I'm sure it will be polished and more features added."

Nevertheless, I can't wait to really get into this game. The sense of scale and the ship models, as well as the ability to manoevre ships in 3D is amazing. Truly, this could be the Homeworld of the VR generation. Also, the Dev is super friendly and responsive. Clearly, it is lacking in some areas -- for example, the explosions are kinda dinky for now and the UI is not all that user friendly. Still, if you have a VR headset and like space games, surely you can afford the measly 6.99 to buy this ! It costs less than a pack of smokes in Canada, FFS !"

Hopefully the game will be expanded so that we can have fleets like homeworld! I think the only negative I can come up with is that I would like to be able to stand on the bridge of any ship so that I can watch the fleets battle outside and not have to put my main ship at risk.  Even if it was only the cruisers and/or destroyers.  It's games like this that will change the RTS genre forever.
,Recommended,535410,26095632,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,Majistic,"It's a pretty good game and idea actually. There's some simple ressource management with mining ships and with your credits, your build yourself a little flotilla to defend/attack. I also like how easy it is to select your ships and you got about 4 different selections ""boxes"" (which are mostly cones). It's pretty cool being able to switch from the bridge of your capital ship to a view from outside, where you can walk around your ship and see them in battle. I can't wait to see more stuff added to this game!"

I hate to compare this to other games like Star Trek Bridge Crew and Flagship, but my gosh does this game have a ton of potential! It's an extremely practical game, something I haven't had the time to play with in the Vive since I'm currently working on something else... But it is a really effective RTS! Reading through the reviews, I certainly wanted to give in my input and support for this developer!Great job getting the functional aspects out of the way, and the ships look gorgeous in VR! Don't let the screenshots fool you! Everything is different in VR, and this one by far doesn't have enough praise for the toy-like miniatures that you can hover around in 3D space! Homeworld was meant for VR, and this game is a heaven sent spiritual successor!My only criticism here is the space backgrounds, I hope you can improve on those. Otherwise I can't wait to see more ships, and more polish on the mechanics in the future. Definitely excited to see where this goes!"

,Recommended,535410,26563929,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,[A.] LeadBrick,"Really good, but I feel this is closer to a tech demo than a full game. The units in the game need more life/AI. Besides the small ships from the carriers, the rest just sit there like they are models.Also, I know its hard to come up with a 3d selection type thing, but I didn't really get a good feeling for the selection method in this game. Moving and resizing the game field was fine, but selecting and deselecting units was really awkward.Lastly, the sounds only seem to play if you are close or the ships are large (scaled up). When the play space is scaled down everything looks nice, but sounds poor."

It's like playing with toys when you were a kid, having all kind of cool battles with your imagination. Now its all in 3D and with some pretty cool models. This game is a lot of fun and I look forward to how it develops. I think it was money well spent. I have just about every vr game for vive and this one is not like any other game.Basically, you controll a fleet of ships, each ship with various function. For instance, one ship is a miner. You send it to mine asteroids and bring in money to spend on combat ships like destroyers, and missile ships. You then use these ships to destory your enemies fleet. It's pretty simple and straight forward once you figure out the controls. You can scale the play area and ships so they are life size (huge) or down to the size of a Matchbox or Hot Wheels car."

Abetter way of sending the ships into battles would be nice.  Either that, or I am doing it incorrectly.  The sounds need to be vastly improved.  One has to be almost on top of the battle to hear anything at all.  Keep going with this and you will have a fantastic game here.  Refer to Homeworld to get some new tips on how the game can be."
