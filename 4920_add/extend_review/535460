,Recommended,535460,26097111,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,IronPanda,"This  is exactly what it says, a collection of the sort of scenes that you might want to demo in VR to new users. Graphics are good and vary from photorealistic (cliff) to the kind of Richie's Plank effect when you're standing over the city.The cliff ledge in this is as effective as the tower scene in Oculus Dreamdeck with birds flying above and the wind blowing. I'd pay $1 for that alone but there's a bunch of quite polished scenes  in this that are perfect for VR demos.I can think of a couple of scenarios i'd like to see added but for the price and the convenience of being able to demo multiple scenes from the same program this is great value."

It's pretty good for introducing people to VR because its surprisingly effective (especially the rope swinging scene).The game is split up into several scenes which include you standing on a narrow cliff, in the ocean with sharks circling around you and performing a base jump.Well worth it for the price and good for showing VR to the whole family."

The other stuff is cool , too, but 98% of my playtime has been me swinging around the small cluster of buildings and bridges. Definite recommendation!"

,Recommended,535460,26156431,"Posted: 21 October, 2016",all,A Sentient JDAM,"The static scenes were kinda meh for me, but oh man, that grappling section. Best Spider-Man game never made, in my opinion. I felt a good amount of vertigo in that; the fun kind. This is just a tech demo, but I really hope someone expands this mechanic into a full game."
,Recommended,535460,29807993,Posted: 9 February,all,Syrsly,"A Fear Of Heights, And Other ThingsorA Terrifyingly Fun Cheap VR Variety PackThe grappling scene was what ultimately sold me on getting this for a dollar.  It was the cheapest grappling game I could find and one of only two that utilized both Vive controllers.  It was hard to stand up for the grappling experience, but sitting down makes it more bareable.  Overall, the grappling hooks scene isn't much fun, and you can get stuck easily and have to restart it, but if you simply can't afford Windlands or refuse to buy from that dev based on ill-placed morality, this isn't a terrible experience for just 99 cents.There are many other experiences/scenes in this variety pack, but only a couple of them are maybe worth checking out.  Most of the experiences are not interactive and only act as visual scenery (and not even good scenery), but one such scene actually has a nice bit of realism to it: the ""Dark"" scene.  Basically, it's a cave with a closed door and two paths.  You have a lighter that goes out very easily, and there are a lot of things happening in the unlit areas of the scene.  The lighter is interactive and based on the lighter from VRTK's room demo scene but looks more realistic. The sharks scene only works if you stand up, and it's not a very convincing scene, but it's still kind of cool for a reason I can't explain.  There's a scene straight out of an Indiana Jones movie (or possibly inspired by the Star Wars trash compactor scene) where you pick up a gold statue from a pedestal and the walls start to move toward you.  That scene, like many of the other scenes, is trying to evoke an involuntary emotional response, though I just found it cool.  The only thing that really gets me is motion sickness, and that's the grappling hooks scene or the base jumping scene.  The base jumping scene could easily be done better and provide you with more interaction, but instead, the dev opted to have you simply pull a trigger and go along for the ride as a disembodied camera flying off a building.  There's no character to watch, no hand model, and the movement is so fast and so sudden that you may find it very uncomfortable.If your VR collection isn't too great yet, I say get this to pad said collection, especially if you like to show off VR to friends.  There's a nifty demo mode on the main menu that makes it easy to start a demo reel of the scenes for showing off VR."

76561198017147659,Recommended,535460,28942804,Posted: 2 January,all,Old Ned,"Short review - It's $1, and it should be in your VR list, so just buy it.Longer review.I grabbed this and had a quick flick through yesterday, I wasn't expecting much obviously, it's $1 , and I was right, there isn't a whole lot, you go to a few static scenes and look around, however, these scenes are great, I love the way the Dev just loads you right on the edge of the cliff, it's like ""You're going to look over a cliff"" and then it loads and you're like ""Whoa! I didn't realise you meant right on the edge of the cliff!"" , the Window Gondola was a great experience, although as a ""VR Vet"" so to speak it had little effect, as someone else said , the city is very Richies Plank style, I would also suggest the gondola raise higher, but fun none the less. The closing walls scene was an Indiana Jones moment, except no escape, and then of course what everyone talks about, the Spiderman-esq swinging through the city like a pro.... did I say pro? I meant swinging through the city smacking into buildings because I suck at Spiderman.Overall this is a great little tech demo, you can't go wrong for $1 and is a great intro for VR virgins.This should be in everyones VR list, well done Dev, simplicity is genius.Would love to see this heavily expanded on and re-released."

These are great and everyone agrees that the Basejump, the 2nd time, is the best. (I've had a few people end up on the floor the first time through so now we are in a position to catch them the first time we put them through it :-) )."

,Recommended,535460,35017444,Posted: 17 September,all,FastLawyer,"Yeah, it's worth .99 cents, but just barely.  Just don't have high expectations.  This VR experience is really geared for VR beginners.  Nothing was scary, the graphics were on the low side, and you can't even jump off the ledges (you just hang out in the sky looking down).Still, it's a nice intro for complete VR noobs who want a light adrenaline-inducing VR experience.Rate 5/10"
,Recommended,535460,26182649,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,Lord Dongkey,"I highly recommend with *one serious caveat*.The base-jumping experience gives you no warning before very fast, no acceleration movement hits. For me, this was deeply nauseating. Took about 2 hours for the blech in my stomach to wear off after that.This coming from someone that has had no problems with artificial locomotion in the past (except for rotating in a swivel chair while running away from things in Dreadhalls on the GearVR, to put it in perspective)."

If I was the developer I would consider expanding and improving the concept, for example, considerably improve the graphics of the city, improve some of the experiences, offer more experiences, and then charge more. If Richie's Plank can charge £6 all day long you could improve yours and charge more - I think people enjoy experiences and you're on to something by offering a program that offers multiple experiences. As it is, it's well worth the asking price."

Anyway, it has like over 6 experiences but the last one is amazing. You get to be like spiderman and you shoot ropes to get around with the city. The other one I like is clif. You are on a clif overlooking a huge valley with beautiful mountains."

Far more fun than the recent Spiderman homecoming demo. It actually lets you swing around a city like you were spiderman. Which is what that spiderman homecoming demo, just ended before letting you do.Oh and there are other little experiences too, but its the swinging one I'll come back to.Plus if you spam the left and right triggers while on the ground, you can zip along at speed like you are The Flash!Well worth the price of entry, even though the graphics are basic! Big grin!"
