In fact I have been dying for a modern movie making game like Showtime.  Sadly it was not really worth playing.  The menus are badly designed, and don't make a ton of sense.  Lot sof typos and inconsistencies in the text and tool tips, poor tutorials, and needlesly opaque game design.Seems like it was on the right path, but really needs a lot more polish to stand out in a world where there are dozens of great game released each year.it also is not nearly titilating enough to be interesting in that regard."

,Not Recommended,535490,31613565,Posted: 7 May,all,Revan1er,"I honestly can't recommend this game in his actual form.The tutorial is absolutely horrible and don't help much.You need to guess what the dev was thinking to unlock hidden places...Just an example: you need to give an origami to the to ice cream salesman to unlock a new area...Why an origami? Why him?And for others locations you can unlock them by simply clicking on the building and paying a fee...If I have to resume my though about this game: Lack of information, not enough location and very illogical choice of game design..Now, do this game is trash? No, when you take the time to understand how to play it is really enjoyable and I like playing it but I am still very frustrated when I need to use a new function but have to spend hours just to understand how it works...The dev need to make a help section or improve a lot his tutorial. He or they (I don't really know) have to change the way to unlock the hidden location. Choose ONE way, not multiple! I mean giving a donuts to the cop to unlock a place is absolutely not obvious! I still didn't unlock all the hidden place because of that and it is really frustrating because you can't make pause and click on the map to found the hidden spot.If the dev fix these points I will gladly change my evaluation and recommend the game!Wait for an update!"

I’m not so sure somewhere in here I think as a credible management game, the issue is figuring out what is going on to actually manage. Not enough information is given to allow you to make judgement calls, skills with no descriptions. Actions with no guidelines and the tutorial isn’t much help.That being said the game isn’t made to be explicit its genuinely trying to be a management game.

Theres obviously a lot missing in terms of features which im assuming are coming ( guys, a proper tutorial, customization etc ) and stuff which isnt ( no gay porn its a russian developer ) but lots of potential makes me recommend the game.Only 2 things stand out in the game design that bug me 1. ok no nudity thats ok if i wanted to look at people having sex I wouldnt bother with a game id just watch my neighbours but the game has a massive black bubble that obscures the action when your filming and i find it so distracting its wrecking the game for me. The Sims got around the nudity problems in games fine by just pixalting the bodies in this game it looks like a wrong game decision 2. Not the translation from russian to english  just the game wording - the actresess are labelled with genre and favourite role but its not clear what these mean for instance favourite roles have three catagories myself, im in and im here. Myself is obviously solo but the other two ? groupwork, two people, guy and girl and a pack of buiscuits ? The game could be clearer with what stuff means without breaking steam rules ( not sure but lesbian or masturbation wont turn anyone on or outrage the moral majority  ) in a game about catering to trends and markets its annoying that the trends are so hard to predict due to obscure language"

,Recommended,535490,29124075,Posted: 8 January,all,fedorsam,"The best and most thoughtout tycoon kind of game at the moment. Yes, it's raw and unpolished so far.But, the game is very stable and the mighty economics machine is calculating and accounting every action you take.Porno Studio Tycoon covers a lot of aspects and has a very deep level of details. For instance, you can make a photoshoot with your actresses, that will lead to selection of photosets, designing the finished products (t-shirts, calendars, posters) using this photoset, producing the items themselves. Goddamit, you can even start a fashion trend.But main part of the game is still making movies of special sort (you know what I mean). This is an interesting process with different variables. Everything depends on the qualities of the actress (or actor), the place, where the shooting takes place and, most importaint, on the demands and pecularities of the market, where you've decided to sell your movie.To be short, this game is a diamond in a rough, but it's already fun to play.Pros:- VERY detailed simulation of the industry, it's production and marketing aspects (you can even buy links for your website and do SEO for it)- Beautiful artwork. Every location is hand drawn with a lot of details. You can interact with a lot of objects in different locations- Possible expansion of the business, with new office and staff. Which also adds new functions to the gameplay!- You can develop your skills as a cameramen, director, researcher and marketing specialist.- You don't get bored of this game. It holds you. There's always a lot of things you can master and get to know.- The developer is very responsive: I've made some suggestions about the gameplay and treanslation and developer has implemented them next day! How cool is that?Cons:- The game is still in development, so there are some missing textures from time to time- Some gameplay features are hard to undertand without the extencive tutorial- On my laptop, edges of the game screen go beyound my actual screen (maybe it's my resolution 1440x900)- The game is too ""safe for work"" for the complexity it has. Old ""WET The sexy empire"" was way more exposed and adult.Overall, I very highly recommend this game. Even if you won't see much naked wemen and boobs, you will experience an indepth economic simulation which is fun to play9 out of 10 porn scenes"

,Recommended,535490,29872720,Posted: 12 February,all,NiVer0n,"Porno Studio Tycoon - excellent economic simulator in unoccupied niche. The game gives a ""slap"" to all those who expected to see a real porn here and a lot of boobs - at first it is a game about a young entrepreneur who wants to do what he likes.At the first time running the game, I was faced with the first difficulties. Yes, early access makes itself felt: a meager training, bugs, annoying every time by their appearance, the whole gameplay just dump on you, don't give a chance for some satisfaction.Fortunately, things have changed after a certain time: has become some less bugs, gameplay is step by step now, gradually becoming accessibly where to click, what to do in order not to fall at the start.Just want to note the seriousness of the economy. Everything, as in real life: a limited budget, the first failures, hopelessness and a resounding success. The player will have to start from the set on a camera phone for the budget actresses in cheap hotels. Later, the player has more and more nuances to take in attencion to create a masterpiece ""adult movies"".At the beginning the film depended on the quality of a few sliders in the final treatment, but closer to the middle of the game player open possibility to recruit film crew to use the new space and genres for movies, pick a professional actresses who, in turn, have specific skills. Keep this in mind, when building development strategy.Externally, the game pleases the nice graphics, clearly made ""not on the knee,"" many thoughtful small details that, in general gives a feeling of fullness of the world.Pros:+ Rational mixture beautiful ""timekiller"" and serious economic simulator. Multiple difficulty levels for a wide range of players.+ Step by step gameplay. The player goes all the way from ""green"" to large entrepreneur.+ Nice humor entertains in the evenings, giving the opportunity to enjoy what is happening on the screen.Minuses:- Dull sound.- Minor bugs (white screen after the game).- Novice complicated to join the game.I also want to add: I'm very glad that I helped this product and offer my ideas in development. For this I thanks to responsive developer and a nice companion!"

I can't get past a completely white screen with music playing. Nothing loads even if I let it wait for a few minutes. Shame.EDITAfter being contacted by the developer, who was kind enough to go through the problems I was having in getting the game to work, it finally did. And what i've seen isn't good.To begin with, the interface is extremely clunky and not very intuitive. I also had issues with images deciding not to load at certain points through navigating the menus which made this even more frustrating. I only tried playing for a short time because of these issues and that it just didn't seem to be fun. You would think that a game focused around the porn industry would be fun, but alas this wasn't.One more thing I found odd about the whole thing is the fact that you can load up the game using Chrome as directed by the developer when we were trying to sort out the issues. To me, this makes the price point of the game, which seems to be just a browser based game, to be rather high. A much lower pricepoint, a reworking of the interface and perhaps getting a native English speaking person to join the team to help with localisation to what is probably 99% of the intended market would do wonders.As of right now, I can't recommend this game. It could change later on down the track, but not right now."
,Recommended,535490,31672466,Posted: 10 May,all,Ackwell,"Ok. Back in the 90's I used to play hundred of hours of a game called Hollywood Mogul. It was very similar in style but had no graphics to speak of and mostly just textboxes and buttons. But I loved the game because it was a very deep representation of movie industry.This game looked similar and I decided to check it out and I wasn't disappointed. The business model looks very realistic and making market research and adjusting with it is really cool. I just want to say this is a hardcore business sim with lots of graphs and reports and all that. Porn is just a nice undertone for business management. Really enjoy it so far, making a hit movie feels just as awesome as in Hollywood Mogul back in the 90's.Just don't buy this if you only want full or even partial nudity. Won't find it here, just some very sexy graphs and business reports. But that's the way I like it... ;)Negatives I have so far are some bugs, some problems with translation and some features are not very clear.
