,Not Recommended,535520,34265202,Posted: 15 August,all,RaveSage,"A huge departure from the original for anyone who enjoyed the detailed strategies of Nidhogg 1. Worse than I expected too and I was very willing to give this sequel a chance. I could go into a lot more detail about the changes but I'll tie in the most obvious ones so you have an idea.- Divekicking knocks both players down. If you divekick a wall, you get knocked down.- Cartwheel thrusting is gone.- Rolling into trip is now a slide, knocking down both players. Whiff leaves you in knockdown.Personal nitpicks were the broadsword not having an active hitbox in neutral and the bows mechanic of blocked arrows returning to sender. Honestly the bow in general feels like it doesn't belong but I appreciate them trying something so new.TL;DR If you have as many hours in Nidhogg 1 as me you should just keep playing that. If you just want a party game congrats, Messhof delivered."

As a huge fan of Nidhogg 1 it feels like they've completely butchered everything I loved about the game. Yes, the artstyle is awful but even worse the game doesn't control or feel as precise as it used to. Not to mention they're nerfed the divekick so that it now knocks down both players absolutely destroying the satisfying feeling of landing one in the first game. Save yourself some money and stick with the original."

But the gameplay more than made up for it.Originally, I saw the ""awful"" graphics for Nidhogg 2 and I told my self that I would never buy it because he completely ruined the appeal for the first game. But it grew on me. Now I have come to love them because it compliments the hilarity of the game.As a original Nidhogg lover there has been a few changes gameplay wise. New weapons and quirks to them. Some have complained about the bow, I personally think if you know how to use it it works well. Some have claimed the broadsword is OP, but it has shortcomings. The dagger is amazing if used right and awful if used wrong. The rapier, however, is the all around choice. Either way, you can always turn weapons you don't want off, which fixes any of the complaining.Alot of the original moves have been altered and I have heard the cry of avid fans and how it ruins gameplay. I would disagree and here's why. The original Nidhogg had a great swordplay mechanic (as does the second one) but I often found myself never using it because I didn't need to. I could cartwheel like crazy and then stab last second to kill nearly everytime. Then, if they caught on I would run and then roll-sweep the legs and get a clean kill. Add jumping and throw spamming and that was my strategy and it ALWAYS worked. A few times I would disarm MAYBE. But that mechanic was pretty much thrown out because you were just racing and the game was incredibly fast paced.Nidhogg 2 changes that by adding more falling down doesnt allow spamming as easily. I find myself in this game being in more sword fights that actually use the brilliant mechanic because there is less rolling and sweeping and cartwheeling. Sure you can roll, but instead of sweeping there is a slide move that puts you on the ground (which animation wise is hilarious!). You can cartwheel, but it's more of a handstand then an elegant cartwheel.The gameplay is less fast paced, but is still fast paced. There is more time for thinking to me at least. I find myself when I have a dagger against a rapier planning my attack. To me, it is a great idea to face off against other weapons that all have pros and cons and make you think quick. Other times, it is just a crazy frenzy. But that is what makes it great. Nidhogg 2 is great. It is replayable because everyone is different. It is a mind game that never gets old. Simple yet intricately skillful.I played Nidhogg 1 competitively and loved Nidhogg 2. It is still a competitive game, there are just alot of new quirks and a slightly different set of skills to win then the original Nidhogg. Which I enjoy because it is a new game. I am happy it is just not a Nidhogg clone, but a whole new breed. At times it can be quirky and screw you up because something unexpected happens, but that happened in the old one as well. It makes it fun. Nidhogg has always been about fun and Nidhogg 2 is no different. It is so funny. The little um, Nidhoggins? Nidhoggians? Trolls? Simpsons? Aliens? Whatever they are. Their little determined, terrified bug eyed faces make me laugh way more than I should. I call em buggins cause of their bug-eyes but that's besides the point. The point is, the humor of this game is amazing. They are fighting to get eaten by a monster worm. Absurd. But it all makes sense when you are playing.The original was great in my mind because it knew what it was.Nidhogg 2 is great because it knows exactly what it is. It is hilarious. It is crazy. It is Nidhogg 2.There is alot more that I could say that I am afraid will just bore you, so just go buy the game."
,Recommended,535520,34340608,Posted: 18 August,all,Thinker J,"- The art itself isn't as visually appealing as the first, but its grotisque style grows on you as you play and see it in action. The character cusomization is also great dumb fun for tournaments.- The art direction is just incredible. Take one look at the Yoshi's Island-esque stage select screen or the start menu to see what I mean.- The level design never quite gets as wild as Clouds from the first game, but there are 10 levels with fun ideas, and visually they can be just absolute madness. You'll wanna play every level while messing around with friends.- The jump kick has been nerfed (both get knocked over now), but the addition of spawning with other weapons really amps up the sudden momentum shifts that Nidhogg is famous for. In the end the rapier always felt best for me, but I've gone on a few runs with the bow and broadsword that make me question which is truly king.Summary: It's a very very different game, but still an absolute blast with your friends. If Nidhogg 1 was an instant classic, Nidhogg 2 is more of a future cult classic. Its differences will be jarring for many, but over time its unique vison and ideas will give it a following."
,Not Recommended,535520,34284347,Posted: 16 August,all,Baked,"Real talk:I really enjoy the first game and was excited about the second, but it is really hard to get into the sequel.- Mechanicsfeel more arcadish, random and sluggish, and all of your reflexes and muscle memory from the first game will be thrown off. Honestly the animations are worse and movement strategy is almost non existent because the controls and movements feel more luck based than anything else. Also, hand to hand combat has been ruined since dive kicking causes both players to fall and you can kick weapons out of your opponent's hand. Also if you try to slide under your opponent's sword and sweep them they will kick your head into the ground so that move is useless... The actual controls and mechanics are a mess and are a huge downgrade from the crispness of the first game.The new weaponsare a great idea, but only the basic sword and dagger are done well. The broadsword is too easy, and the bow is useless. The bow is a missed opportunity since you either hit your enemy or they deflect the arrow and hit you. The bow feels like a handicap since you can't swing or thrust it like a sword and the AI always deflects arrows.- Visually,the game is pretty but unpractical. I was looking forward to a visual upgrade since the first game was too bland, but Nidhogg 2's visuals are too noisy and distracting. Often time character's will blend in with the environment which makes things more confusing. There's a difference between adding nice details instead of vomiting neon paint all over the graphics. Also, the game does have some optimization issues so if you're playing on a conventional computer expect some lag on some of the maps with a lot of background effects. Character customization is very limited and the lack of variety gets old really fast.tl;drIf you're coming from the first game, prepare to be very disappointed. Game mechanics are sluggish, random and doesn't have the same strategy and energy as the first. The graphics are nice but way too distracting and too much stuff happening. The new weapons are novelties but are way worse than the classic sword. Character customization is a feature you thought you needed but don't use. All in all, a downgrade from the first.5/10*If you're new to Nidhogg, get the first game, not the second."

The mid air kick gives you a bit more of a forward boost than the old one which is rad for closing gaps.Unarmed players run a little faster now.Can't wait to destroy Messhof in this release too."

You either can't find anyone to play with, or when you match with someone, there's a good chance that the game will be near unplayable due to badly optimized netcode.Arcade Mode (Singleplayer) and Local matches run just fine at a buttery smooth 60fps, but online matches tend to drop below 20fps frequently and introduce very serious rubberbanding and slowdowns.Local matches are really fun, but I just can't recommend this game in its current state for people that are looking for a good online experience."
,Not Recommended,535520,34324862,Posted: 18 August,all,Koala,"By all means, Nidhogg 2 isn't a bad game - it just isn't Nidhogg 1.ARTAs most fans know, the new art style is divisive - you love it or hate it - and I'm not on the positive side of the fence. While the art isn't bad, it's messy and often I find there's too much going on at once (will discuss this more in the MAPS section). The new character customisation is fun and all, but they look quite goofy. Personally, I prefer the old Atari-esque style, although I love the new map selection screen.GAMEPLAYFirst impression told me it was pretty close to the original, but after a few minutes some glaring changes came up. First and foremost, the divekick has been nerfed to hell and back. Both players and knocked down now, and while it does disarm the attacked player the advantage is minimal as both players get back on their feet at the same time. There are slidekicks now, which also have both players knocked down like the new divekick. Thumbs down here.The controls are tight, but feel less responsive than that of the original. Not much to say here other than they're fine, really.New weapons are fun! At first, anyway. The bow, while cool, is nearly unusable against AI and simply not fun when playing against another player. The knife and rapier are both great, but really only in a knife vs knife fight or rapier vs rapier. The broadsword is just not good; no active hitbox when not attacking (ie, your opponent can't run into your sword) and it disarms other players, giving a player with a broadsword an (almost) guaranteed win if they're competent enough.MUSICYeah it's alright I guess.MAPSSome of the new maps look great, honestly, but a majority have way too much happening on-screen which ends up being distracting. Some colours of character on some maps don't show up against the background very well, and sometimes I've found that the differentiation between the foreground and background (ie where you can and can't walk) to be unclear.Overall, the level designs are an improvement! There are returning stages that have been updated to fit Nidhogg 2's new style, and these stages are where I feel the game shines (aside from the art). The new stages are interesting... the art seems to overwhelm the structure - talking about that foreground/background issue I mentioned eralier - but I can appreciate what's there.TLDRIf you played Nidhogg 1 a bit but didn't own it, buy Nidhogg 2.If you already own Nidhogg 1 and loved it, pass on Nidhogg 2. The new features aren't really worth it, unless you love the new art.If you don't own Nidhogg 1 and want a casual party fighting game, Nidhogg 2 is probably the better choice.NOTESI know I don't have much Nidhogg 1 playtime on Steam, I pirated it. Decided to buy it after refunding Nidhogg 2."
,Recommended,535520,34353932,Posted: 19 August,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"It's funny that everyone complains about how they hate the art and it's a step backwards, but few gamers recognize that this whole game is uncomfortably close in design and mechanics to the firstNidhogg. To me that's the real elephant in the room. Now I'm no pro player, so I assume there are minute mechanical differences, but yeah, it's the same game with a new skin. Messhof probably could have just sold this art as a DLC for the first game.I gave the originalNidhogga negative review because it is just plain too simple in mechanics and short on content for the price. While the same is completely true here, I knew what I was getting into and I think the artwork and a few quality-of-life additions are nice.My advice is only get this if you plan on playing local multiplayer. Yes, there is online play, but I'm not certain it's worth it (I also know there have been issues - check the forums to see if it has been fixed). You know what you are getting into.Oh, also, I like the new art."

The net code for it is better than the first one, but it's still pretty bad. This bad code gives the host way too much of an advantage. Most people are probably going to play this either as couch multiplayer or online multiplayer. Single-player is nice, but it's not where the game shines. Couch multiplayer probably works just fine, but online is a no go right now. Until they fix the net code and make it better, I can't recommend it.Refund requested.... unfortunately."

,Not Recommended,535520,34353390,Posted: 19 August,all,iMini,"Onlines seems to be really buggy, takes a very long time to get into a ranked match, but unranked seems fine. Had a lot of issues where the game would suffer from horrible slow-down in online matches (down as low as 15-20FPS), I have an i5 6500 and a GTX 1070 so I'm well above the recommended requirements, must be an issue with the online itself, though the framerate seems to fall/rise with each transition to a new screen.The new graphics are gorgeous, from the backgrounds to the menus themselves there is some really good work her and I like the grotesque look, I think the characters themselves are hideous though and would rather have had soemthing a bit simpler, a bit less stylised. As it stands they are a stark contrast to the quality of the environments they find themselves in. The animations, mechanics and character design should work in tandem to highligh the best of these attributes, but instead I feel like the characters and animations let the mechanics of the game down, being too busy to clearly make out what is going on in a fight, and in a game of precision like that it's vital to retain that.As much as the base game is great, and the levels are great, it's not a huge improvement over the original, were it that the fighting was less busy I might enjoy it more but there's too many distractions as is. I think the game's biggest strengths are in the multiplayer, but the fact that the FPS dips, the long wait times, and lacklustre design, it all leads to just a frustrating experience.Wouln't recommend, just stick with the original until the devs eventually release an alternative character designa dn sort out the bugs in the MP.

Well as someone who has played the first nidhog for around 50 hours i can safely say i prefer this version. Yes the art style at first glance dose look a bit nath but it grows on you after a few matches.Content wise 10 levels with about 4 weapons that change while you play each stage. I though this was a good addition but the bow can be a bit of a pain to use depending on where the other player is and how you use it.All the stages are varied with a lot of stuff going on in the background but lets be honest you ant really looking at the background when you have a sword flying at your from behind.1 Thing I didn't like is the single player because of how♥♥♥♥♥♥the ai is. Just trust me u dont want this game unless you have someone to play it with.I did like the addition of character customisation's but i did think this could have been extended on a bit. By that i mean do the thing that move or die dose and slowly unlock outfit items though the coarse of playing matches as it would give more of a incentive for people to want to keep playing matches.To end yes i recommend this game to anyone no matter if you played the old game or not, its got all the original content with a few new things added on for good measure dont let anyone tell you the game is bad just because of the art style cus in my opinion this is how you do a sequel.Side note i cant say how good the tournament mode is as i never got around to playing it and probs never will so i cant comment on that."

It feels clunky, the art style is just plain annoying, the few combat mechanics there are actually detract from the speed of the game, e.g. you can slide and knock your opponent over but it also knocks you out for the same amount of time, leaving you both lieing there and it's a 50/50 chance between who kills who. Sometimes it feels like the character doesn't turn immediately and you're stuck attacking the wrong way. No one is playing multiplayer, so you're stuck playing in the arcade mode, but the arcade mode doesn't even save your progress so you have to beat the same few levels over and over again in each sitting, vsing stupid clunky AI.There is nothing satisfying about this game and I do not recommed it.

It's just as fast paced, goes as far back and forth, and has that tug of war feeling of the old game. Every weapon has its own benefit, and it's still often a good idea to go weaponless and just run.The new graphics and movement system makes everything feel much more tactile, like you can feel the invidual footsteps of your character. It takes getting used to at first but I think I prefer it. Everyone else's biggest complaint is the graphics, I have no idea why as it's all beautiful pixelart applied to a grotesque, funny style. It's definitely weird but it totally fits, and really adds to the hilarity of the game.The sound is great, lots of vicious sound effects that suit the savage nature of the game. The soundtrack is awesome, There are many tracks I could just listen to on their own. Though I don't know if any track is as good as Wilds from the first game, the overall soundtrack quality is better.Online didn't initially work but after some quick patches the matches I've played were flawless.Although I haven't played many hours, I've played the arcade mode, online and local matches and have enjoyed them all. Local still has plenty of screaming and laughing and quiet tension, and even without the person behind you, I've told people in online matches I was cracking up at the previous round. The game is fun, funny, and every time I've stopped playing isn't because I wanted to but because I had to do something else.The only reason I wouldn't recommend this game is if you're looking for singleplayer only.

It's a fantastic combination of grim goriness mixed with vibrant beauty that's unlike anything else.The gameplay is fast and frantic, requiring you to master the different weapons and stances to fight your opponent who will constantly reappear everytime you kill them in an attempt to block you from reaching your end side of the map.I have two minor issues with the game:1. You cannot play a local match with a bot. Bots are only available through the arcade.2.

The gamaplay hasn't changed except for the new weapons which are a nice expansion but keep the nice feeling from Nidhogg 1.If you liked Nidhogg 1 you will love Nidhogg 2.

Additionally, now that there are five weapons rather than one, the game has a much higher skill ceiling.Also good art; a bit weird, but good."

Some people may not like the art style if they come from the first game but after playing it for 2 minutes it really grows on you. I would also say that the networking is a lot better than the first and is a good experience. Not to mention the music in this game is exceptional.Gameplay wise it is just like nidhogg 1 with new features, new weapons, new maps, and it all works very well together to make this feel like a proper sequel to nidhogg and a great game in its own right. But if you havent played the original you are facing your enemy 1v1 and the point of the game is to run past several screens after continuously killing or getting past your enemy you sacrifice yourself to the nidhogg and win. The gameplay is really king here though, it feels great to control and every weapon has its pros and cons.

But this is a nidhogg game and its about the multiplayer. the local play is as fun as the original nidhogg it is fast paced or slow paced at certain times wich gives an interesting feel to the game the weapons[bow,broadsword,rapier,dagger,kick] provide vastly different uses among each one its almost like a game of rock paper sciccors. for example    bow beats broadsword     broadsword beats rapier    dagger beats rapier      rapier beats bow   it makes it very intense as every time you spawn in praying that you will get the weapon that will best fit your needs.now the problems i have with the game-often one sided matches-often suffers from poor conectivity-hitboxes can be a litle off sometimesapart from those nidhogg 2 is a perfect game that is well worth your money."

I think the aspect of this sequel that most people hate is its new art direction, and I agree that the change from minimalistic graphics to grotesquely cartoonish might be really offputting for a lot of people, but I also think that its purposely disgusting style fits extremely well with the overall tone of both games. Basically, it's really easy to get used to the graphics after  playing two or three matches. Fighting other people is fun as hell, but online matchmaking has some issues.

It does not. It's very clear to me that the mind behind Nidhogg's gameplay was very much able to keep it super tight, just as with the original one.And by the way, the art on this game is wonderful. Like, it's really really good and it fits the game so much better than I could have imagined. It's also pretty intensive on the performances for some reason, though you can change the quality of the effects in the settings. I have a feeling that this might get patched in future though. Either way, looks really good!This sequel comes with 10 (I think?) new levels and 4 different weapons. The level design on *each* of the levels is very much on point, clearly a step up from the original Nidhogg. The different weapons do not ruin the balance of the game, as one may think. The controls for each weapon feel very intuitive and it's really fun to learn how to use the individual weapons against the other individual weapons. It's a whole new depth for the game and it's much welcome.In the end this is just a whole lot more of Nidhogg, exactly what I wanted from a game titled Nidhogg 2.

Sometimes it can be annoying when you spawn with a bow directly in front of a man with a dagger.

I waited too long to realize I would never play this game again and now I can't even refund it. 0.4 hours of gameplay, beat the singleplayer game(and got the achievement) and was pushing myself to even finish the game. Even if we ignore the existence of Nidhogg 1 entirely, the game feels way too unresponsive for a 1v1 fighting game.Nidhogg 2 is unique in no way. The only thing that could be unique about it is just copied and pasted from the first one."

,Recommended,535520,34268303,Posted: 15 August,all,Guybrush,"As a fan of Nidhogg 1, I was very hyped when I heard about Nidhogg 2. And I wasn't disappointed. Artstyle is really nice to look at. Level backgrounds are super detailed, artists who designed the levels and characters knew what they were doing. Soundtrack is awesome too.Divekick being balanced is a good improvement. I'm not crazy about the new weapons but they're okay. (Classic sword only mode might be a thing for singleplayer too?). The only problem with the game is lack of single player content, arcade mode is too short. A singleplayer campaign with Nidhoggs fighting mechanic in an action adventure setting would be great.Edit: After playing some online matches, I think the game definately needs a classic ""sword only"" mode on online multiplayer, these new greatsword, bow and dagger weapons feel really off. Also, most of the time game lags so much it's unplayable."
76561198139553290,Recommended,535520,34268195,Posted: 15 August,all,Teebaggendragon,Nidhogg 2 is alot like the Hunchback of Notredom. Ugly but likeable. The online is kinda wonky at the best of times but get a friend or two and you got yourself a good time. I'd give it a solid 6.5/10 and an 8/10 if the online smooths out.

You might do the same thing when you see the ""videos and funny commentaries.""ProsMany maps.Music is really dank.ConsThe game has very little costumization.There are many maps that iscorrec, but they are repetitive and there are no variety what so ever, except for level desing and music.Controls are wierd and most of actions that you make and kills that you get are random.The game becomes annoying and uninteresting after an hour of play time.There areonly4 weapons. (3 swords and 1 bow. SWORDS ARE ALL FUCКING THE SAME BY THEIR MECHANIC)Only one game mode which is 1v1.Overall, the game has potential, but it is not using it. The game might seem fun and cool to play with friends, but goes downhill extremely fast. Gets lame, boring and repetitive really fast.I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS GAME, WASTE OF AN HOUR OF MY LIFE. I WASTED MY MONEY AND TIME, SO YOU DONT WASTE YOURS."
,Recommended,535520,34427298,Posted: 22 August,all,Games Bond,"Okay, so this is coming from a person who has never actually played the first game yet. It's not because I didn't want to but it's mainly because at the time it came out, I didn't have my own PC to play it so by the time I already owned one the hype for the game was far too late. Buying Nidhogg 2, however, was a good decision for me. I've just bought this game and I've already spend almost 2 hours on it trying to practice each of the weapons in Arcade mode. I'm not sure if it's just me being new to Nidhogg in general or something else but I heard that the AI was not as challenging as it is and is too easy because it usually hangs around once it kills you when it could have been running to the next screen. Well, if you're like me and you get cocky easily, once it actually kills you again if you make ONE slight mistake and they're near to the spot where they have to go to the next screen they ACTUALLY GO as if they're trying to taunt you. Once again, I'm not sure if this is a real thing or not but this is what I have experienced and I like it because it gives me the rage to try harder which is what I felt when I played through the entirety of the Arcade mode. As for Multiplayer, I played a couple of rounds with a random and I don't see any lag spikes or anything (maybe on the account that this game isn't graphically extensive) so with that said, I think this game would be just as enjoyable to play online with a friend as well as locally, which is where the REAL fun would be! People still commenting about the art style, I agree it's a little garish, odd and grotesque which is a weird turn of events for the developers to make the aesthetics like this so I am also trying real hard to get used to it. But the customisation is super cool and the backgrounds are ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful. I wished they kinda made the characters less goofy but kept the same style for the backgrounds because hot damn, I'm a sucker for nice visual backgrounds in a fighting game. As for the gameplay itself, I watched TotalBiscuit play both of the first and the second game and saw that it is much more balanced and fleshed out which is very nice to see and it still has the rage-inducing but super fun and fast gameplay that we all grew to love from the first. The new weapons add so much more variety and strategy from such a simple and yet complex game of violent Tug-o-War. I would highly recommend this game if you have a pal (or few since you can host an 8 player local tournament!) either online or offline, this is simply a fun and addicting game. Finding other people to play with online is not much of a hassle as well and Arcade is a good place to practice and the customisation is just as wacky as the gameplay itself! Just uh...you'll get used to the actual characters themselves. They're a piece of work, I tell ya."

76561198127361577,Recommended,535520,34698588,Posted: 2 September,all,BKnee,"Nidhogg 2 has a few flaws. While the game is very fun, it does get a little boring after a while, and  I certainly don't think the game is worth $15. If you really want to buy the game, wait until it's at least 30% off, and it may be worth your money. Other than that, the game is extremely fun, the visuals are interesting, and the 8-bit music is fun to listen to while battling a friend to the death in this game. I only hope that they add the Steam Workshop to this game so the community could add even more fun twists and features."

The online is great, when people are playing. The game shines best in its couch co-op-esque mechanic of Local Multiplayer, something lots of recent games lack. Nidhogg 2 is a refreshing experience and a lot of fun with the right setting. It does have its subpar qualities but those are overshadowed massively by everything else in the game."

It would be nice if online muliplayer worked properly so you can set up a game quick between you and another player, instead of the NPC (don't get me wrong, the UI is pretty good at times) I think that the online multiplayer will help keep the game more relevant for new and enjoyable battles instead of bugging my friends to come over and play."
