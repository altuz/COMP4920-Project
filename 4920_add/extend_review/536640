,Recommended,536640,26481352,"Posted: 7 November, 2016",all,MewmewGirl,"*Edit - I made a few comment updates to this review, the updates are in a single paragraphs wherever you see ""*Edit"".  There is a tiny bit of new information but nothing has been changed otherwise.*There is a lot of misinformation about this game, and I'm only really posting a review to correct some of it.First yes, it *currently* is online only because it was meant to be an online game played with others.  Nowhere in the description does it say ""Single Player"".  Nowhere.  It says it's an online survival game and single player isn't listed anywhere in the tags.  And yet people buy it and complain there isn't an offline mode because it didn't hit them over the head enough with the warnings that it's an online game?  It gets all the data from the server for the areas and such you're playing in.  It's not as if it is just needing an online connection for no good reason.  The game was made to be multiplayer and doesn't list itself as single player, and yet so many down vote the game because it doesn't come with something it never said it did.  Anyway they're making an offline mode, which I can't say if it's a good idea or not for a game meant to be played online but it's coming down the line.*Edit - I do admit they could have done a better job explaining this is a hub based ""light MMORPG""- and I feel they would have had more sales if they had done that.  You see other random people in game if you're in the same town areas as they are and can group up with them to play together as well as friends you invite.  Still they never said there was a single player mode anywhere so to complain that it's not single player is odd to me.  It would be like complaining Guild Wars 1 didn't have an offline mode.  These hub based light MMORPGs usually don't...*Next the cut scenes - this game is based on the lore from the TV show Grimm.   Nick and Hank are looking through one of Nick's books of Grimm for information, and you're basically playing what they're reading about.  The cut scenes some people complain about that are just ""two guys looking at a book"" - that's the whole connection to the TV show and if you've watched Grimm you'll be happy with having that there.On to the ""slowness"" of combat.  You start out with a huge piece of tree and then a giant club you're fighting with.  They are slow because they are meant to be more realistic.  You're a Grimm that's stronger than a normal person by far but still these are pretty huge weapons you're swinging.  You also start with a shield that's slower because of it's size.  Later on you can switch to faster weapons and a much faster shield.  Maybe they should have started you out with faster equipment so people would see how the game plays with them from the beginning, but they are an upgrade choice you are supposed to earn as you play.I've had no issues at all with server lag, but my play time isn't very long yet so I'll keep playing and update a comment here if I do start to have server issues.*Edit - Still no lag issues for me.  The game is made to learn the patterns monsters use and to avoid or block them early.  Some people play and think the game is being slow when it's performing like it is supposed to, but others may be out of the two server areas so actually would be having lag.  I've not had even the smallest amount personally being a US based player.*When I connected there was a US server and a server in Europe.  Yes, if you are not in those areas maybe you will have issues playing.  There isn't just one or two servers that go up to 600 people - if a server in a region gets full another will appear, so you always get to play.  You're not locked out if you buy it and there are already 600 people online.On to character creation - this is a little weird but you do have control over the look of your character it's just you have to let it randomly assign your look and then keep clicking to go through random looks.  If you click the gender button on the character creation screen it will randomize your look.  To get what you want you have to keep clicking the gender button of your choice and wait until it randomly comes up with a look you like.  It's weird and a bit annoying but not unheard of.  The way they do it definitely leans towards the ""con"" side, but you *do* have the ability to keep rolling random looks until you find what you like.  So you're not just forced to look one certain way.  I'm guessing some people just never pressed the gender buttons up top to see that it randomly changes the look each time you press one or the other.The game is supposed to feel more like being in the real wilderness, so there are some open stretches without as many things to fight on them as some people are looking for I guess.  Having played other ""survival"" types of games it really isn't too much different than the way a lot of them are made like that.If you're a Grimm fan you'll probably be pretty happy.  Being a Grimm fan myself, I am probably influenced towards liking this a bit more than I would have otherwise.  The game is fun to me and I would recommend it.I can't really say if it should be $15 or $10 though yet because I need to play the game a lot more to decide.*Edit - Yeah it's worth the $15.  The landscape seems repetitive if you stay in the same areas searching for stuff a long time, but the environment does change around a bit as you continue further into the game.  I do wish there was more variety earlier on, it's so beautiful, but it does change up slowly.  The game also gets much more active as you go along with lots of dangerous creatures all over.  It starts up a bit slow with mostly normal woodland creatures but it won't be long until you're swimming in harder and more interesting stuff.*If you want the solo offline version you'll need to wait until they update it to say it's here.  If you like playing multiplayer games with friends on Steam and you both get this, it's pretty decent though.  It's also really cool for Grimm fans.  Other people may want to wait for a sale to get it.Like every game that exists you should go check out longer gameplay videos before buying to see if it appeals to you.  That's pretty much a given but I felt I'd mention it anyway.  The game is quite beautiful but you should see it in action to help you decide if it's what you want or not."

For a ""roguelike"" to be enjoyable the combat needs to feel crisp. In this you can potentially be hit by an attack 15 feet away, which makes for an unfun experience.* Story is mostly from text and cutscenses of two guys looking at a book.* Maps are gigantic with very little content. You can go minutes without seeing an animal or a resource.* No stats/attributes/skills, making the game seem very simple with no long term objectives other than make that next weapon. No long term upgrades like with what you would see in Rogue Legacy."

Its fun going out and doing the ""hunts"" and getting random stuff but the ""stuff"" you obtain is ultra simplistic. We are essentially grinding to get hunger/health and some bombs.I will give it a thumbs up because I have faith they will tweak the game over time.Two biggest things that need tweaking:1.) The maps need more ""meat and potatoes""... Maybe random humonoid patrols or random events... Something to make the world a little bit more alive. It feels like a walk/run simulator just like every other survival game I have played. It is as if the word ""survival"" in a game means you need very long travel times.2.) Itemization... The character can equip 4 items... Primary/secondary weapon.... A shield... and a ""potion"" which is like a trinket that grants one benefit such as resistance or more health....  This is way to basic. More slots and more variety for both ""trinkets"" and weapons is needed.Overall, the game concept is there but the implementation of how and why is super simplistic.7/10  Rating in its current state with massive potential to be a lot better with some patches."

It's basically the same map every mission, which consists of: Kill animals for food, hunt Wesen (supernatural baddies, ie werewolves), repeat.Speaking of Missions, they generally consistsof ""Collect food"" or ""Kill baddies."" Occasionally its ""Find NPC on the map somewhere with a limited form of radar. Scour every corner of the map for about an hour, click the NPC once, then leave.""Every town appears to be the same.Buy/sell prices are horrible, but made up for by the fact that you're constantly farming since thats the entire game anyway.sNo level-up system, so aside from gear upgrades, there's not even any benefit to the eternal grind.All in all, it was fun for a little while, but definitely doesn't seem worth playing to completion."

I love the TV show that it's based on, but you don't need any previous knowledge of it to really get into this game.  It takes place in the show's universe history, old world europe, where you learn that the world is not only what it seems, but far more dangerous.The game looks amazing with the style perfectly matching the mood and gameplay. Add to this the developers are exceedingly responsive to players.  On launch there was no offline play, then players really wanted it, it was added NEXT update.  Fantastic!  Which brings me to the co-op aspect.  Yes, you can play with friends!  Roam the historic countryside killing Wesen (the game's universe term for werewolves, and all other supernatural creatures both good and evil) while arming yourself and just trying to survive with a fellow Grimm, yes please!I was hoping and expecting good things, and was not disappointed."
76561198072162222,Recommended,536640,26400933,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,Dan,"The game is sitting at about 60%-65% positive in my book, so I'd rather give it a positive than negative. That being said, the game needs a whole lot more than what it currently offers.Maps are not very unique, and seem very much repetitive. As are the quests of kill this or defend that.That and the fact randoms can just enter a map and plow everything without you knowing is another no no. The online bit, is arguable at best. I don't mind it, but as the whole randoms showing up without your consent, makes offline mode a plus.No character customization, no stats, all the towns are the same from what I've seen so far, and no leveling up makes for another simplistic approach to the game. Which would be ok if the combat and response time didn't seem so stiff and delayed. Throw in the fact aiming with ranged seems off center as well. Combat really needs a retwerk to make it more appealing. I literally find no point to use block as its more of a pain and obstacle than a benefit honestly. Dodge is your friend.As for positives, the game is ""fun"" and the art style (As many have mentioned is great.) I know..the list of positives if very very small...but again, the game does seem fun, be it highly highly repetitive and will hold your attention for a few hours (Even if you're just playing to get through the Grimm storyline.)The survival bit about finding food, materials, and recipes is hit or miss for me. Some maps are teaming with game and vesen, materials and chests...while most are empty wastelands. Adjustments are needed.At the end of the day they have so much potential to make the game WAY more than what it currently is. That and given the IP they have, they can do THAT much more and seeing as how much is in the game currently...yeah, it's borderline negative review but again....60%-65% for me in hopes that what positives it does have carries them in the right path for futher patches."
,Not Recommended,536640,32979656,Posted: 29 June,all,ƸӁƷ ♥Hot Lips♥ ƸӁƷ,A lovely beautiful fun game to play and i like it but sadly the game sometimes hangs during play as no doubt it needs an updated patch.What happens is you could be on a leisure hunt and everything works ok till some point when you collect or killed some creatures then when you try to kill a creature by hitting it then you find you go thru the actions of striking the creature but it has no effect as if your weapon does not make contact with the creature.Also the same when you try to collect items you go thru the motions of collecting items but don't collect anything even when you got plenty of space in your bag to store items.Also it can hang when you go to a sign post and press E to leave and enter main map and it will then hang when you try to click to return to the village on your map and the only way past this is to leave the game and restart it but sadly everything you have collected on the leisure hunt is lost because the game restarts from the point you left the village to go to the leisure hunt mission because of the way the game is set up to save your progress.My computer specs is way above what is needed to run this game and i have windows 7 pro so it's not my pc.The issue is with the programming as it seems there is a conflict within the game data which a patch is needed to put it right but sadly i think the devs has given up on this game as there is no latest patch yet.It's a shame as it's a good game but sadly not playable.

You're already in a party, but someone has to load into the level for someone else to be able to join, which gets annoying. But other than that, combat is pretty fun. It feels like hitboxes could be adjusted, but if you get used to it, it's not all that bad. It just becomes part of the game. You'll learn to dodge behind things or block rather than dodge back, but still get hit due to hitbox sizes. If the difficuty keeps ramping up, I can see this game being a really challenging game. Which is kind of what I was hoping for. Which will in turn only be even more fun for multiplayer."

Not a very creative game and the pacing is about as good as the last few seasons of the show.  I hope there is more depth to this game than what has shown so far because each mission is a redress of the first 3.

I'm not doing another try - quests are too repetitive!Worth the price tag though, if only for the art.That being said the game could be renamed: ''Eating & hunting simulator 2016''.-Pros--Smooth controls-Amazing art-Music/soundtrack is fitting-Cons--Only 4 quest types (find a guy, protect villager(s), gather food, kill x mobs)-You eat non stop. For some reason your guy needs to eat far too much. Food also heals you after your full so you're always in need of more, it never ends. Even if you end up full you'll just get hit by something and have to eat half of your rations to heal up, which in turn means more hunting needed.-Hitboxes are ♥♥♥♥ed up, you can't really dodge everything, especially wolves/boars/witches-Some mobs deal far too much damage (Witches)-Bugs (beastiary, invite feature)-Can't move your food around in your bag, which means you'll always be eating the left most food if you hotkey eat, otherwise you have to open bag and pick the food you want to eat and drag it or double click. That's very annoying considering you eat non-stop.-Weapons are weak for the most part - you get most of em through quests (axes you get through chests) and most are fairly weak at any given time. To kill♥♥♥♥♥♥ you use bombs. (consumables)Aka: Have food, be full HP, farm bomb mats - repeatYou'll use your weapons to finish stuff off mainly.-Potions are like accessories mainly. Unlike the blacksmith (in which you can swap the gear you've made) if you make a potion it'll override the previous one and it's gone! This is a terrible feature seein as they cost quite a bit to make.-Food recipes are too expensive for the most part, that's unless they nerf hunger.-No bosses ( Think there's only 1 last stage)TL;DRGame's cheap, worth what it's worth. Quests bland, weapons weak, not too many bugs, bombs rule all, hunger's ridiculous."

So I'm going to return it and wait until it goes on sale around new years probably. By then they should have added offline mode so that I can enjoy going through a quest without having some random person hop in and finish it across the map OR randomly joining another player at the end of their quest just to exit out for doing nothing. Hopefully they'll add character customization, maybe some map variations because the maps aren't very unique. Same open square fields with forests blocking certain paths. Could use more tutorials/explanations on how to operate your bag space and inventory (only food weighs you down which is nice but confusing how I can carry a whole mess of misc. supplies.I have high hopes for this game.

I think the multiplayer instances are cool- but the problem is anyone can show up beat the quest take all the good item spawns and you're left with nothing.For a roguelike there is a HUGE lack of gear. I was hoping for a lot more item variety but unfortunately I've been hitting people with the same club since the first area. I am starting to notice the difficulty ramping up slightly but the beginning game is so slow it's nearly unbearable. I feel more like I'm playing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ JRPG than a cutthroat roguelike.I like the game- it's a cool concept but it needs work. More gear, more monsters, and a higher difficulty curve would do wonders for it. The first few areas there is 0 challenge. Womp defenseless bunnies and deer.
