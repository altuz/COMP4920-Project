This game has me leaping like frOgs on a poNd. Sure, the price might be a little high (which asuming the sales going on right now it will be a fraction of the price in a couple days) but this game is amazing with so many surprising and weird moments you go through as a fairy. Throughout the journey a nice and cheerful fairy gives you advice on what to do. It's always helpful and made progress through the game. I recommend using the fireworks underground to find secrets and treasures. Get this for people that want to get a fun, relaxing, and even a little funny.

,Recommended,536890,29020776,Posted: 4 January,all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","Glittermitten Grove is a game that doesn't really look like anything special on the surface, but when you dig down deeper it really opens up. The village-building mechanics are simple but fun, and the mechanics of having to balance structures on your fairy trees to make sure they don't snap from the weight or making sure you don't plant trees that block the light of other trees make things interesting. It starts out easy, but once you hit your first winter you can tell that the game's looks can be deceiving. The interface for planting trees can sometimes be annoying, though, and the game doesn't give you much room to go anywhere but down, leading to a situation where eventually your entire area will be scorched earth with trees hanging by threads after the ashes of fireworks burn away the ground. It looks a little expensive for what it is, but give it some time and Glittermitten Grove might really surprise you."

The faeries can only build their structures in trees which also provide fruit as the primary food source. Players have to keep their trees uninhibitted from the sunlight while also mining deep beneath the earth in order to get the resources they need to expand their village and keep the faeries happy.

76561197968547326,Not Recommended,536890,28964493,Posted: 2 January,all,The Despair Uranus,"This is difficult. I enjoyed my time with Glittermitten Grove, but I can't honestly recommend it. You may have played the spiritual predecessor, and come in with some expectations. Unfortunately, this game has issues.Unlike the first game, which followed a single character over a long period of time and many adventures, this game lacks a throughline (or really any characters at all). Other than the advisor from your starting town, and a long-running reference joke about Korn, there is nothing connecting the disparate parts of the game to each other. Each diversion is a well-executed miniature game, but lacks substance, and are completely interchangeable with each other. Their sense of humor made me laugh at times, but it's all Family-Guy-style reference comedy. The situations, while absurd, aren't particularly clever, don't have any underlying meaning, and are essentially fluffy time-wasters.Spoilers ahead:TXT World is the game. That's it. The rest are just time-gates you need to sit through before being allowed to progress. Half of them, you don't even need to win at to get the item you need--you'll be awarded with the prize and kicked out win or lose.TXT World itself is only a middling ZZT-clone. It has some clever ideas and more than a few funny gags, but it never develops much, and has less than 20 rooms. The mechanics of TXT World are designed to annoy, and as the game ended, all I could think is, ""Is that it?"" The game opens up for the player once you leave Glittermitten Grove, and I kept hoping it would continue to unfold. All I found though, were WarioWare-style diversions and throw-away reference jokes."
,Recommended,536890,31267891,Posted: 20 April,all,A Knot Of Lights,"The first hour of Glittermitten Grove invites you to a very relaxing experience, slowly hinting at the depth it possesses. These facets are there to be discovered, masterfully hidden in plain sight. I enjoyed every minute of my time with this game, and I recommend everyone give it a try."
,Recommended,536890,28809212,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,I was always on your side.,"Frankly, when I first bought this game I was just taking a stab in the dark, giving a random indie game a chance and boy did it pay off. Really, this game turned out to be a lot better than what I was expecting, personally I like how the game just dives right in without explaining much. Originally, this was how all games were, with only the instruction manual to help you if you had any questions, the little tips in the game kinda replace that, it's this sorta ""figure it out yourself"" attitude that I like to see in games that you don't really see as much in the AAA industry.Getting back to the review after that little tangent, this game has a lot more to it than what you might get from the trailer or screenshots. First of all, all of your actions have some sort of consequence for later on. Rationally figuring out where to place things is important since trees can block sunlight for other trees later on. Accurately predicting when to store up on resources is also useful since there are seasons where getting resources is more difficult (ex. almost impossible to get food in winter). Curiously, the mechanic used for mining involves shooting fireworks into the ground. Truthfully, I actually think it's clever because the different splits of fireworks you can use provide a large amount of possible strategies to use. In my opinion, anyone can play this game since it's difficulty is lenient enough that even novice players could get along in the game while advanced players will have more than enough tools to mess around with.Of course, $20 is quite an amount to spend for many, but if you're willing to take a chance you won't be disappointed. Nearly all the other games I've played this year can't even compare to GlitterMitten Grove. Surely this game deserves an award for it's outstanding performance, but it's relatively unpopular at the moment, so I can only hope it  gets more publicity in the future. 2 hours in and I already couldn't put it down, that's how I knew this one was gonna be one of my faves."

,Not Recommended,536890,29257426,Posted: 14 January,all,wizorb,"Glittermitten grove is, in and of itself, a very simply fun game with a shallow learning curve and an immediately apparent reward for learning the game's fairly simple mechanics. It's nice to look at, it's original, and it's a worthwhile time-waster if you're into building bases and managing resources. There's not really an endgame and the depth leaves quite a bit to be desired, but we all know that's not the game you want to hear about.Frog Fractions 2, or TXT World as it's called in-game, does not measure up to its predecessor. I'll admit, it's got a very unique sort of charm, and the minigames that are unlocked are funny enough; the glaring issue is that the game utterly lacks the spirit and sense of absurdism and unpredictable over-the-top progression that, in my opinion, made the original Frog Fractions great. The game is interesting and engaging to a point, the difficulty is tough but fair and easy to adjust to, but rather than an imaginative journey from humble beginnings through a goofy and nonsensical plot that retains cohesion with interesting -- if consistently silly -- writing; TXT World serves as a sort of ascii hub through which to access games that feel like in-jokes and collectibles that reward you with cheap nonsense meant to make one laugh through its randomness and reference to pop culture. The entire time I was playing, I was left wondering, ""When does the real game start?"" to which the game replied, ""Never."" If you're a die-hard Frog Fractions fan and want to see what the developers did with the kickstarter money they raised, then you can spend $20 on a nifty resource manager and a collection of game jam titles, and hopefully prove my feelings about this game wrong. As it stands, however; I cannot reccomend this game. I was disappointed and saddened by this title, and while I don't regret purchasing it, I couldn't encourage any of my friends to spend their money on this end product. Maybe wait for it to go on sale? I don't know."

When we were kids, video games seemed like they had endless depths to explore and uncover. This game captures that feeling perfectly, while also being genuinely funny a good portion of the time.

,Recommended,536890,29284039,Posted: 15 January,all,Phalbutt,"Glittermitten Grove is on the surface a pretty standard town planning sim mechanically similar to ""Towns"" or ""Dwarf Fortress"". The games core concepts are based around a balancing act of resource management whilst keeping your fairys happy & contented however when you get deeper into the game and penetrate beyond the surface gameplay you'll find yourself in a much richer world than you first imagined.Glittermitten Grove's strongest area is its rich storytelling with both memorable characters and a deep and thrilling plot you'll end up quite emotionally involved in how the story plays out. I won’t talk about the plot in order not to spoil it, however it is certainly worth getting into.I feel the weakest part of Glittermitten Grove is the early game; with a slower introduction than might be expected and no long term goals yet introduced. My advice for the early game is to rush sparkles and fireworks. Another point of disappointment is the reduced mathematical complexity of the game, while the in-depth toasting mechanics where quite nice I found there where not as many fractions as I was expecting.Glittermitten Grove is set apart from other similar games is its mechanical depth. The game introduces many twists to the classic building placement setup e.g. a sunlight & shade trade off, and an interesting weight distribution system. The added complexity of these systems really spices up the game play.In conclusion I would feel comfortable recommending this game and would rate it a firm 10/10 Glitter Sparkles."

If you haven't... go play Frog Fractions 1, it's a far better game than this one and it's free.After having loved the original Frog Fractions very dearly, I am sad to say this game does not live up to the original. The original Frog Fractions took about 5 minutes to really ""start"" - meanwhile depending on your luck with RNG as to where a door spawns, you could spend 10-30 minutes in the fake Fairy Game before getting to the actual game.Additionally, while Frog Fractions kept bombarding you with new thing after new thing and witty, clever jokes - in Frog fractions 2 these ""new things"" are very sporadically hidden in a TEXT RPG world that is equal parts tedious, confusing, and just plain unfun. In order to get to the gameplay changes, you have to find very well-hidden doors that can sometimes be hidden behind an HOUR of puzzle solving.Worse still, a lot of the game seems to have been made tedious for no reason other than to emulate how tedious old ASCI games were. You get TWO different upgrades, roller skates and a sword, which both make your character control WORSE - one can only be removed if you have a certain item, and another is required for progress. So your character controls their best and the very onset of the game and control worse and worse as the game goes on, so that doesn't feel great.Imagine working a mundane data entry job, but once every 20-30 minutes someone cracks a half-decent joke. That's frog fractions 2 - a boring, frustrating, soul-crushing job that is OCCASIONALLY funny. I speak with no sarcasm or joking tone when i say that you are just better off playing Frog Fractions 1, or replaying it, than buying this game."

The game itself is mostly a series of diverse minigames, wrapped in an early-90's ascii-graphics computer game, which is itself hidden in a fairly simplistic fairy-themed management game.So, is it a good game?  That's a difficult question, because this sort of thing comes down ultimately to personal taste.  If you haven't played the original Frog Fractions, I suggest you do so, because the general style of humour is maintained through to the sequel.  It's also free online, and shouldn't take more than about half an hour of your time if you know to dive down into the pond at the beginning.I myself enjoyed this game.  Whether or not you will is up to whether you find nonsensical self-referential humour appealing."

So I'm not going to play along with the fake review shtick, and review the game for what it actually is.Frog Fractions 3 (this game) and Frog Fractions 2 (the arg leading up to this game) are both extremely ambitious, and Jim Crawford deserves my money for the effort and love he put into the project alone. So is the game actually fun to play?Well, Frog Fractions 2 is over. You can read about it here:https://wiki.gamedetectives.net/index.php?title=Frog_Fractions_2https://wiki.gamedetectives.net/index.php?title=Eye_Sigil_ARGI'm not somebody who does ARGs or even keeps up to date on them while they're happening, but looking back now, it's clear that Jim was dedicated and resourceful and ended up creating one of the most in depth ARGs to date. The Eye Sigil ARG even spanned across random games including QWOP and Crypt Of The Necrodancer, and the creators of those games had no idea what they were for when they were asked to put them in and didn't know who was asking (disguised as somebody named the ""Sigil Master""). I gotta give mad props to Jim for this.But how is Frog Fractions 3? Well to be honest, a majority of my playtime I found myself just not having much fun. I think the main problem is the length. Frog Fractions 1 was around 30 minutes, and didnt stay on one focus too long. Frog Fractions 3 revolves around a game called ""TXT WORLD!"" and lasts around 4-5ish hours, maybe more if you want to dig into all the secrets. There's a lot of good game design jokes in this game, but each one lingers for way too long to the point where it stops being a joke and starts just being bad game design added onto the game. Some are handled better than others, but some last almost the entire 5 hours.For example, at one point you obtain a sword which you can spin around your character (to clarify, this is a top down ascii game, think old roguelikes) which is cool but also is blocked by walls. Meaning now your character is two spaces big and you constantly have to rotate and fidget with your sword to get past one wide pathways. At first I was laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of it, but when I realized that 3 hours in I was still using the sword it just made me swear at the screen every time I had to navigate mazelike rooms. Even earlier on you discover ""Gems"", which look like currency so you pick them up. You quickly realize when you gem counter is full you can't pick up any more gems, meaning that now every single coin on the floor is an impassable object. Again, another funny joke, but becomes tedious when you have to deal with it for the rest of the game (luckily this one is not as bad, you can find a secret to increase it to 50 and every time you beat a minigame it resets down to 0). There are tons more including a bridge and autocorrect skates but I won't delve into every single one of these as I'd be here forever.So if TXT World is 65% of the game, how is the other 35%? Well, pretty standard and what you'd expect from Frog Fractions. The wacky minigames feel like they have way more production value now, and actually feel like they could all be real games somewhere if they didn't just last a short while. I think it's kind of funny that in the end, this is actually an educational game- FF3 has you scouring the internet for information on the Meiji Restoration, sparknotes for all the levels of hell in Dante's Divine Comedy, and old derogatory slang words. I'm glad Jim tried something different with anchoring the game around TXT world and not just making a 5 hour ADD trip, but the minigames where you're not frustrated at a smiling ascii face are the true shiners of this collection.And how is Glittermitten Grove? Actually, pretty amazing. I think if it wasn't designed just to funnel you into FF3 and actually had a progression into lategame with more to do I'd be playing it more than the ""actual game"". It has a pretty genius light mechanic that makes it so you have to be careful of how you grow the trees you live in, as taller ones can kill smaller ones. You also need to manage food, but your fairies leaving is pretty penalty free because you can't lose all of them and more crawl back as food is available. But like I said, there's not much to do other than to keep expanding infinitely with your small selection of buildings until you eventually discover the door to FF3.The ending is pretty climactic and fitting to the build up of the game, but happens kind of abruptly. I guess you know it's coming since there's literally no more rooms in the game to explore.Anyways, this review is kind of going all over the place, but I guess that's the nature of Frog Fractions. The long and short of it is that I don't think I wasted my money because I'm giving money to an Indie dev who is massively dedicated and passionate, but I also don't feel like I had much fun. I guess buy it if you love the idea? But if you're somebody who doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the developer's intentions and just want a good end product, I think you might not like it."

Don't get confused.OK, this has the be the perfect sequel for Frog Fractions they could have made. It has the same atmosphere, the same style, and the same depth.My final consensus is at the bottom if you don't want to read all of this.Let's go through the Pros:+ The game isn't at all what the title thinks you are getting too, like the original. Sure, there is a main game but most of the people playing this want the FF2 part of the game. And all you have to do to progress is go underground, like the original!+ It goes through different game genres, like the original. There's chess, a snake game, a Carmen Sandiego spoof, you name it. All of those games are very well done too.+ The overworld is immersive with tons of collectibles. I love the zelda like feeling, though its not really zelda like. It's text based, hence the name TXT WORLD! There's a lot of symbols you need to collect to actually beat the hardest part of the game.+ Cleverness. This game is very clever and funny like the original. Like how you can actually import your Mass Effect 2 save, if you collect the max amount gems you can't go through them, so it's actually bad to collect them, the way you can just walk right past the guy trying to block you going without a sword, and the ending just to name a few.Though there are a lot of pros, there are some cons, but they are pretty minor:- The sword is so annoying to control and you can't walk through one way places with the sword beside you. This is so annoying and made it hard to actually get through the game at parts, and you can't even unequip the sword.- The rollerskates are very annoying at parts, but very useful at other parts (but the annoying parts happen more often). You can unequip them, but only after you get the white key which you get at the end of the game.- SPOILERS! Don't uncover the black if you haven't played the game!The frog at the end was so confusing, that I had to ask the discord for help on it. I eventually figured it out but only after this one guy told me what to do.

It is clear that it was built as a disguise for FF2 and its quality shows for it.Honestly, FF2 itself does not live up to the hype. Despite the awesome ARG campaign and lots of community buzz, I didn't really appreciate this sequel of its beloved predecessor.You spend way too much time in the text-based overworld, which while was fun for the first half an hour or so, became very tiring, very fast. Clunky mechanics (that was probably on purpose) such as the irritating sword positioning made navigating the overworld extremely rage-inducing and detracts from the real gold of the game - its minigames, of which were so short that honestly the game would have been served so much better if TXTWORLD was shrunk down to just another minigame and more effort put into producing more innovative minigames.Honestly this product is not worth $20. I spent way too much time navigating the terrible overworld and hated every moment of it. The puzzles were pretty good but again, not explained very well, and while a good spiritual successor to the original Frog Fractions, its a poor game on its own and does not obtain my recommendation. You can live without it. Just go and play the original Flash game, that one produced way more enjoyment for me than this product.I hope the dev is able to use the success of his Kickstarter and this experience to produce better quality GAMES rather than gimmicks in the future. There is great potential here, unfortunately it wasn't brought to its fruition by this product. Get it on sale for $10 or less. There is no replay value here, and while I have spent 7 hours on it trying to unearth its secrets, it was 6.5 hours of unenjoyable playtime better spent somewhere else."

Then once I got to the prize inside, I was just given a clunky and awkard ASCII rpg, with only finding the real Frog Fractions-esque games I wanted every 30 minutes or so."

Not worth your time."

Whoever thought that building faerie villages could be so much fun? It seems simple at first, but once you get involved it almost feels like a completely different game.My only reservation is that it's a bit repetitive. Maybe there could have been more variation in the landscapes, like more mountains or even lakes and rivers - it would be cool if it had an amphibious section! But then again I've probably only seen 1/2 or even 1/4 of what it has to offer, so I shouldn't complain.This is a stunning debut for Mostly Tigerproof, and I imagine if they ever announce a sequel it will be the subject of much anticipation and speculation. Highly recommended!"

Mini-games are a mixed bag, but a few are great, and none were that hard, so it's a good trip to the zoo."

If you want to have a nice, relaxing, good time with this game, don't spoil it for yourself. Just catch it on sale, and play it. If you really want to see what all the hype is about, PM me."
