I played the beta for a while and couldn't wait to get the complete game. Today I received an email from steam that Redie has been released. The wait is over. And what the developers have produced is awesome. The graphic is nice for a top down shooter and the physic of the flying boxes, dead bodies and explosions is really well thought. It is a simple game which is also challenging. The global leaderboard is a nice idea to get addicted what already happened to me."

Had 3 friends around me saying ""This level looks easy!"", needless to say they took that back. Love the challenge system too! All round at least an 8.5 for me. If not higher."

,Recommended,536990,31895975,Posted: 21 May,all,h4mx0r | natchan!,"It's basically hotline miami with a different look and an emphasis on guns. Kinda like ""Hotline Miami-Lite"". There's also no story, it's just level after level.Each mission has a 'mastery challenge' that asks the player to complete it in a specific way (ex. Complete in 25 seconds with two double kills, Complete is 30 seconds with no explosions, Complete in 25 seconds without using the same gun twice, etc.)It's fast and smooth, and restarting the level is as fast as it is in Hotline Miami.$10 is the high end of what I'd pay for this. Anything less is a decent price for this quick fix."
,Recommended,536990,28151702,"Posted: 2 December, 2016",all,Doppler,"I bought this game trying to support the developers with no expectations in mind. Let me tell you, I'm blown away. What a fantastic game. Challenging and rewarding with a great Mastery concept for each level that makes you want to complete the level as fast and as accurate as possible.That being said, it's not without flaws and bugs. The tutorial promps don't take into account any button mapping you've done, for example. On the topic of button mapping, you have to quit the game and restart it to access the button mapping. Lastly, while the art style is fantastic, I wish there was some music that better fit the game as the current soundtrack feels a bit generic and repetitive. The plus side is that I have not noticed any issues that hamper gameplay.Overall, the positives greatly outweigh the negatives here. I just hope the developers continue to support the game as it has a ton of potential."

76561198213063584,Recommended,536990,32207611,Posted: 5 June,all,tarsnip,"Try the demo first because there's only one difficulty setting in this game- It's very high, but it's fair.Controls are so smooth (even on my old PC) that you won't be let down in fire fights by dodgy frame rates or bad hit boxes. In the full game you get extra levels and a few new enemy types and guns. More of the same as in the demo really.  The levels are well designed and have a good selection of themes to them but it's quite a lean game. Each level is good and with no cutscenes or filler material, but it won't take you long to complete them all.There are nice touches that you don't get on some bigger titles - Corners of walls chip out from the bullets, glass breaks and furniture flies all over the place. The only down side is that there's no story to link it all together - It's unashamedly an arcade style shooter only, but it does the gameplay well. Towards the end of the game each level seems so impossible it's both funny and frustrating, but with the power of infinite rapid-restarts you can try out all sorts of crazy strategies and create some spectacular action. Winning against all the odds makes it a worthwhile experience in the end."

Even without the mastery some of the levels take a couple dozen tries to make it though.Very happy with this game, 9/10!"
,Recommended,536990,28147766,"Posted: 2 December, 2016",all,0x000000A6,"This top-down shooter is not for the faint-hearted.I was able to test the beta before the release, so I had a little more time spent with this game in total. It doesn't even try to bring elements like story-telling into the game just to have it. Its concentrated on one thing: fast reactions and redying constantly. The graphic performs good and fits the purpose of the game.The price is reasonable for the time you can spend with it. Reminds me a bit of our old Q3A sessions. Shoot, shoot, shoot. Die. Respawn. Die. Respawn.Pros:+ Easy to learn, hard to master. You need skill for this game. May not be the first choice for truly n00b casual players.+ No bugs so far.+ Music, even if relatively simple, is not getting annoying over time. I actually like its style.Cons:- Sometimes it makes you wanna bang your keyboard against the desk 'cause you redied for the 100th time but still can't get your hands off it :D"

,Recommended,536990,28155666,"Posted: 3 December, 2016",all,ШР Дlмэdi,So far everything has been pretty good and Im liking the game other then for a couple small problems. The main is that on desturctable walls the debris go over the ground and normalling this isnt a problem but on some levels in a small hall way its  impossible top get by and you will get stuck in the rocks. Also it would be nice with some arena mode or some more content. Also most of the settings cant really be changed ingame which is annoying not like you need a lot for a game like this but still. The description really isnt joking about unforgiving aim and inhuman reactions. This game is hard but very rewarding when you finnaly pull somethines off. It gives off hotline miami feels but it feels very orginal still. 9/10

It definitely draws inspiration from Hotline but it feels very much like its own game. Very slick controls, precision twitch shooting. You can make some very cool moments. Be warned, it's pretty addictive. I sat down to make a short vid and ended up with over an hours worth of footage to cut, so yeah, thanks.Here's some gameplay footage for a better idea:https://youtu.be/gmV6z2WTQOY"

But redie is a shooter where you can lay out your strategy and try it. The bots are predictable in their moves and kill you almost instantly on sight.So far I'm on level four and I guess I could have made my way through the game a lot faster. But I tried the masteries.I'm playing on Linux with an Intel i7-6700k and a Geforce 760 and my fps never go below 320fps. (Tip: press F10 for in game stats.)And .. yeah be prepared to redie and hit Alt-F4 in frustation, just to instantly reopen the game."
