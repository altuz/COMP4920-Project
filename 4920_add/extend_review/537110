,Not Recommended,537110,32984614,Posted: 29 June,all,Red,"I want to start this review off by saying I am not bored by RPG Maker style games that focus on story with minimal gameplay and I adore story rich games in general. However my entire experience with Angels of Death felt half-baked in that every gameplay element it tries to pull off feels unfinished and not well thought out.The ""puzzles"" are flawed in that I never once had to stop and think about what I was doing. The answers were either incredibly obvious or it was a matter of ""use everything in my inventory on this one thing,"" which would take about 15 seconds and then the puzzle would practically solve itself, lacking the ""AHA!"" moment which makes puzzles fun in the first place.The other piece of gameplay is very occasionally evading killers, which actually sounds like a fun concept until you realise that this just means running along a path and hoping you don't take a wrong turn. Don't worry if you do though, you just have to wait a few seconds to load and then try again with absolutely no consequence for your failure because the game autosaves right before any part where you could potentially get a game over. This completely kills any tension that could have been established with these scenes.The last thing that could be considered gameplay is walking around the world exploring and interacting with things, and they somehow ♥♥♥♥ed this up the most. A game is meant to make you feel that you as a player occupy a space in a virtual world which functions even when you're not playing it. However this game feels manufactured in a cookie-cutter way in that everything you have the option to interact with is only there to advance the story. There are no interesting little things you can find hidden away that offer world building or more information about the characters. It lacks the hand-crafted charm that is often the reason I play small indie titles like this one.The main problem with Angels of Death is that it has no reason to be a video game. Completely failing in all it's gameplay elements, all that's left to this title is a dialouge only story that most people have much lower standards of writing for because it's ""just a video game.""TLDR: Angels of Death attempts to tell a story which can be told much better and more completely using any other medium of storytelling. It's almost as if the developers wanted to make a visual novel, but couldn't afford artists so instead they downloaded rpg maker."

From the same creators of 'Forest of Drizzling Rain', it is one of the most popular horror rpgmaker games in Japan currently, it has already a manga, novel and even events being hosted in Japan. Pixiv reached over 8000 fanarts of this game in the spam of a little more than one year, and there is a reason why.This game is a masterpiece. The story is unique and complex, not to mention emotionally captivating, with unique characters and a great development for the protagonists.The graphics themselves are rather good, considering it is a pixel rpgmaker game. It has a sense of atmosphere, changing from beautiful to creepy whenever it is needed.The soundtracks are also top quality. Different pieces are played, fitting perfectly with the scene.The gameplay isn't challenging. For a horror rpg some would even consider it easy. However, it has many unique features, so it is not tedious.Some might find it lacking a bit in horror aspect. Where it is definitelly present, compared to other horror rpg games, the horror bases itself more in the atmosphere and plot, so unlike games like Witch's House or Misao, there are basically almost no jump scares. Some would consider it good, while others would find it bad. I personally find it good.Like I said before, the strongest point lies in the story. I won't spoil, but it is something that envelops you in every way. At the end, as much as messed up a horror game can be, you can't help but love every aspect of this wonderful masterpiece.Overall, I give this game a huge 10 out of 10. I might be biased, consider it might have flaws, but I enjoyed it in every way. It is my favorite horror rpg maker game so far and is completely worth buying it, considering it will support the creator who distributed this game in japanese for free at first."
,Recommended,537110,28916529,Posted: 1 January,all,Anika,"This is my first time writing a review, which is something that I generally won’t do, but I feel that this game was special enough that it really deserves it. This review is spoiler-free, as the story is by far best enjoyed going in with as little knowledge as possible. If you haven't already, I recommend not reading the chapter summaries posted on the store page. They don't contain any key spoilers, but some things are far better left as surprises. By the way, yes, you have to play the chapters in order.Basic summaries will be at the top, with more in-depth thoughts below.Length: I streamed my first playthrough, so I will update this review at some point once I replay and have accurate times. The first three chapters are approximately the same length, and I found that the fourth is significantly longer.Pros:- Charming characters; good development; a very touching relationship between the two protagonists- Enjoyable and creative mechanics and puzzles- Deep and emotional story; lots of metaphors and symbolism- Graphics are appealing- Free music is extremely well chosen and very impactfulCons:- Occasional typos (which can be submitted to be fixed)- Running is clunky and tight turns are hard to control but scenes which need it are simple & shortRecommended for:- People who have played RPG Maker games in the past and/or are familiar with Forest of Drizzling Rain- People who enjoy visual novels or similar games with a frequent narrative and lots of text- People who want to enjoy a good (great) story and don’t mind fairly linear gameplay (there's still puzzles and etc, of course)Not recommended for:- People who don’t like to read a lot and prefer gameplay over story- People who don’t like RPG Maker graphics and (very well chosen) free musicAs for my personal thoughts, I recommend you play Forest of Drizzling Rain (same creator, Stardust KRNKRN/Makoto Sanada) first. Everything is very different, and AoD is an all-around improvement, but I recommend familiarizing yourself with the general style of the author beforehand (also, it's free). I loved FoDR and went into AoD expecting the same level of story, but my expectations were absolutely blown away. While I’m sure some people are bitter over freeware being released for a cost, the effort put into the translation and into the original game absolutely deserve your money.The story and characters were beyond enjoyable; it brought me to laughter and to tears, and while I understand that this kind of game isn’t for everyone, I can safely put it on my list of favorites. The creativity blew me away, and the game took many turns that I didn’t expect. If you think you’re even slightly interested in it, I absolutely,absolutelyrecommend you play this game."

,Recommended,537110,31458744,Posted: 30 April,all,futaba-tian,"Chu~This game impressed me so much that I cannot but write a review about it. This was an unforgettable experience as far as the story itself is concerned. The characters…well, it is a difficult topic while all of them are extraordinary in many aspects.So, let’s start with the most interesting part: the plot. I should warn you that there will be some spoilers in my review, but I will do my best to hide them and not to ruin the plot twist for you (oh, and there is one, trust me!). Please, do not read the hidden parts unless you have already played the game!The story tells us about a girl, Rachel Gardner, who finds herself in an unfamiliar place all alone. She is surprised and wants to see her parents as soon as possible but has no idea what to do and what happened. She sees an elevator and tries to open it. However, all of a sudden, there comes an announcement: “This girl is a sacrifice. The game starts”. Quite intriguing, is not it?And here comes the first floor, the first trap. Speaking about the gameplay, the game is not difficult at all. You can die, of course, but I do not think that it will happen too often. The main idea of the game is to show you a story, not to make you suffer from unsolvable puzzles or meet your end while fighting with endless enemies.The characters. We have a very interesting cast here. First of all, I would like to talk about Zack. My first impression of him was negative -he was trying to kill Rachel and was quite a madman. To be honest, he scared me to death with his sudden appearances and crazy laughter!. However, starting from the second episode, my opinion on him began to change. On the one hand, he is as crazy as a Mad Hatterwell, the main difference is that he also kills people, but, on the other hand, he has a surprisingly innocent soul. Sounds strange, I know, but his childish outlook on everything and everybody made me like him more and more with every episode.Most of all, I was shocked by the story of his childhood. He lived in an awful place where he even had to bury bodies of other children! He was no more than a piece of meat for adults there. No child, no matter how strange he or she is, should be treated like this!I was rutting for him to survive through the whole story.Secondly, there is Rachel herself. You might be surprised why I did not mention her first, after all, she is the main character. The only thing I can say is that you need to play the game to understand the tragedy of this little creature.Her life was as horrific as Zack’s one. Parents who always argue and have no interest for their own child, who beat each other and her, who deserved to die. And they died. They were killed by the hand of their own daughter. She just wanted to have her “own” perfect family and did not know any other way to achieve this goal.This is the most contradictive person in the whole story. I still do not know what I feel about her. Is it sadness? Or anger? Or disgust? Or sympathy? She deserves all of them.In the end, I cannot but mention other characters, the executors, the Angels of Death. Each of them is a complete person with their own bugs in the head. Each one has their own views of sins and virtues. And again I cannot say whether they are evil or good. They believe in their theories to such extent that they have become their very core. Still, the only person I really disliked is Cathy. This one is a cruel *insert a word here*, whom I despise not only for her beliefs but also for her terrible laughter. It was driving me crazy the whole second episode, for God’s sake!So, after talking about the characters for so long, I am finally coming to the main idea of my review. The ending was both surprising and predictable in some ways. However, I was mostly impressed by what kind of impact it left on me.I was happy for two crazy killers! I was so glad that they survived and made their way out of this hell. And the ending itself is the best way to put the final point of this story. There is nothing to add, nothing to remove.My verdict is: play Angels of Death! No matter whether you like this type of games or not! This is one of the best stories I have ever read and the characters made me feel the whole spectrum of emotions, from fear to happiness, from love to hate. You need to try this title to understand what I am talking about. It is rather difficult to find the right words to describe all that I have seen there, and I do not think I should even try to do it. Angels of Death is worth your time and money, and this game will make you think and not just mindlessly click through the story.P.S. The final note: the music in the closing credits is amazing! Wish I could get it for my music collection. Also, the art of this game is not something that everybody will like. Personally, I found it as an integral part of the story and would not like to see any other artstyle there."

If there are, you will be asked to save right before encountering them.If you're into RPGs like LiEat that have more focus on the story telling than hard puzzles and gameplay, I would strongly recommend this game."

The character building, the pacing, just everything felt so smooth. At first I wasn't that interested by it, but as soon as I dove further into it, I was infatuated, I couldnt even stop playing it. This game will 100% give you that satisified feeling after finishing it. Angels Of Death has so many twists and turns you never get bored, it truly is one of those story gems. I know, some of you may think I'm over hyping it, and well I just finished the game so I'm kind of still hyped. Overall I've never written a review on any game, and I play way too many, but I decided to take time to write this since it stood out way more then any other. I'm so glad I gave this a chance."
76561198146588217,Recommended,537110,29820149,Posted: 10 February,all,Shikomizue,"Before I say anything else, let me start off with a few words: this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.Now that that's out of the way, let me give you the nitty-gritty.So, the premise of this game is that a girl wants to be killed and a serial-killer promises to do that after they make it out of this facility.Now, at first, you might be wondering, ""How good of a game could this possibly be with a premise like that?""My answer to you, would be, ""Trust me, it gets good.""At the outset (meaning most of the first episode), it may not seem as great as I make it out to be, but that's because it's not supposed to be like that so early. The main thing that makes this game great is a little thing called character-development. There is so much of it in this game, it's insane. You'd never think an emotionless 13 year old girl and a ruthless murderer would be such great and likeable characters, much less be a good team.Honestly, the gameplay is secondary to the story besides maybe a few parts, so if you're thinking of playing it for gameplay, you might be disappointed. The story, however, is masterfully written and played out. The script is always entertaining, always brimming with character (though there are a lot of elipses, I must say). Even the non-main characters are interesting, and I say non-main characters because saying they're entirely supporting would be an insult. Every character plays a part in the story in a way. It's set up so that you'll understand some things better towards the end than when you first encounter them.Oh, and the music is creepy, epic, emotional, or wacky whenever it needs to be, perfectly matching the situation. The art is also very original, not ""original"" as in disgusting to look at either, I mean original as in very well designed. It's not like there are too many hidden details within the character art, it's just really nice to look at.This has become one of my favorite stories afrer playing through such a great game, the ending is perfectly suited to the story, that's all I'll say about it.All in all, this is a great game. I'd even say it was 10/10. I'd definitely recommend if you have $10 to spend and want a masterpiece of a story."
,Recommended,537110,31819026,Posted: 18 May,all,angelwolfchild,"First of all a question to whichever genius wrote this story.HOW?!How do you create something that is both ****ed up and ****ing beautiful at the same time?I do not want to spoil the story because it is best experienced blind, in fact I'm very glad I got around to playing it rather than watching a let's play as this is one of the best game narratives I've experienced in a while. The main crux of it really focuses on the growing bond between Ray, a teenage girl who wants to die, and Zack, a ruthless serial killer, as they leave the building together with the promise that Zack will kill Ray once they've escaped. From there we go to each of the floors, which have their own unique killer to run from and puzzles to solve. I loved encountering each new threat, every character was extremely memorable and each one presented a different type of challenge to overcome. But it really is the relationship of Ray and Zack that pushes a lot of the emotional scenes, in fact it's quite unreal how much my heart aches at some of these scenes (I should not want to hug a killer as much as I do playing this).The graphics are also really impressive, there is so much personality not only in each character's designs but the way they move when they're on screen, and they match up with the expressions on the character portraits brilliantly. While the levels aren't huge they do match the theme of each killer, and the puzzles don't get repetitive. The mechanics are quite basic but it works, the one issue I do have is how difficult it is to be precise while running; I died several times because I was running away from something  and I couldn't quite line up the character with the door I needed to go through (but that could just be me). I would love to get hold of the soundtrack as there are some amazing songs throughout, particularly Zack's chase theme.The funny thing is that I recently made a list of my favourite games but I feel I need to rearrange it to include Angels of Death, this is easily my favourite RPGMaker game. Overall it's a fantastic game that I highly recommend, I loved playing it and I'm sure another playthrough isn't far away in my future.On a final note, I really think Doctor Danny needs his own rendition of the Jeepers Creepers song; that's literally what came into my head every time he said 'peepers'."

What makes this unusual is that Rachel has little desire to leave the building, and in fact simply wants to die. She agrees to help the killer on the condition that he will kill her once they escape the building.The story features interesting characters, fun puzzles and levels, and an emotion-filled, bittersweet ending. I highly recommend this game."
,Recommended,537110,30209339,Posted: 26 February,all,Nanneri,"I bought this game wholly expecting it to be one of those trashy RPG Maker horror games that were in fashion some years ago. I just wanted to have some cheap laughs at the unnecessary edginess and the ridiculous dialogue and then move on.The problem is that, while I did find some of the hilariously edgy dialogue I was looking for, I also found a really well-made game (as far as RPG Maker games go, of course), with an interesting enough storyline and compelling - if at times ridiculous - characters.Furthermore, I found myself unironically enjoying it, and -much to my dismay- I even teared up in the end.The gameplay is nothing to write home about; the puzzles are fairly simple, and more often than not the answer is spelled out to you. This shouldn’t be too much of a problem, however, since no one ever has played an RPG Maker game expecting some sort of revolutionary gameplay.If you’re wondering whether you’ll actually get your money worth of playtime- you will. It’s a surprisingly long game, and it should take you between 8 to 10 hours to beat depending on how fast you read and how much of the optional dialogue you get.So, what are you waiting for? It'll be ten dollars and ten hours well-spent, so go ahead and buy it.TL;DR: This trashy RPG Maker game made me cry instead of making me laugh, go buy it now."
,Recommended,537110,29362977,Posted: 19 January,all,Hana,"You have no idea how long I've been awaiting for this game to finally be released and translated. Ever since seeing fan art to it around on the web; I've been keeping up to date with the updates to it on the Japanese vers. but had NO idea what I was even reading. The manga is now translating, slowly if interested. Now that I saw that it was available on steam, I was quite excited to purchase it once Christmas arrived. Whole reason I bothered to re-install Steam honestly, haha. Anyways, onto my review:Satsuriku no Tenshi; also known as Angels of Death is probably one of the best indie psycho horror games I've played yet by RPGMaker. The characters are loveable, especially the two main leads, Rachel and Zack. It gives dark humor, yet a bit of heart-warming feels as you go through the story to the game. Coming from the creator to ""The Forest of Drizzling Rain"", I'd say it is well worth a try if you enjoy indie horror games. Although there's really no jump scares included compared to the other RPGMakers; it is still very much worth to try out. I feel as if there are more challenging 'mini-games' included compared to others I've played. The soundtrack is amazing and fits perfectly in pace of everything occuring in the game. I couldn't bare myself to stop playing as an episode was completed. 5-7 hrs or more altogether if going slow at it like I did. I wouldn't recommend the game if you can't stand reading whatsoever at all. But most games do consider that nowadays, no? :POverall; my rating for this game is a 10/10. Masterpiece well done and can see why it is considered one of the most popular indie horror games in Japan. You will not regret purchasing this game."

Some of the puzzles were a bit difficult, but that may be because I can be a little unobservant. The game isn't very long, though it certainly isn't short. Around a 5-6 hour completion time. Nothing felt drawn out either. The ost is also really good, and fit the atmosphere of the game pretty well. If you like RPG horror games like Ib or story orientated ones in general, you should certainly give it a shot!"

Never thought this game would become one of my favourite stories.Firstly I got the game cos I like horror themed RPG indie looking games.Then I started playing, this seems nice I hope it gets good.HOT DAMN DID IT GET GOOD!!!It just got better and better.As things happen more questions appear, things you WANT to know, it keeps you hooked.Every night before I'd go to bed I'd have two choices, sleep or play some more? Everytime, ""I gotta play more, I want to know, I want to be back in that world!""Story 9/10:Wow just wow. Like how wine gets better with age, the story gets better with duration of play. It starts off simple everything isn't hectic and you get the bearing of what's going on. As the story progresses things start to heat up and the pace becomes something you can really get into. Nothing I feel is rushed out of necessity. More could have happened but I am very pleased with what I got.Characters 8/10:It was a good mix, some characters I really liked as more and more info came a float and made them more fleshed out. There was emotion of every kind. Some characters could have done with a little more fleshing out or maybe not. How the story went it's a little debatable. Some characters were nothing short of suprises.Soundtrack 8/10:Beautiful. Some of the tracks worked quite well but a couple really made me feel emotions fitting to what was going on. It made me understand the characters and story more which formed a connection to these characters.Enjoyment 10/10: Like I mentioned before I had to play more of the game, it was so exciting, enjoyable and something to really get into.Anything bad? Well sorta but it's nothing major I feel. There's only so far you can take graphics and animation in an RPG pixel game. To be honest that's what makes it unique. Sure it could have been done in better graphics and animation, but it's not something desired. I liked the art style it was done in and that was enough for me.I also thought the game could have been a little longer as I finished semi-quickly, but again I don't think it needed to be longer. It's not some huge budget game with world building factors. It's length fitted it nicely. I think it was the feeling of ""oh, it's over... I want more."" But when you feel like that it's a sign of a really good game. :)Overall thoughts:Great story, great soundtrack and great characters.I am very pleased with spending money on this game. Definatly worth a buy.Thoughts and fanart of this game won't be dissapearing anytime soon.It has it's cons but the pros out weigh the cons by a ton. I know this game isn't perfect, there are things I wanted to happen or be different, but so does everything. I know this game wont be for everyone, some might disagree with me completely and that's fine. Everyone to their own right?If you feel like you can spend that small amount then I highly recommed it.Find out will you enjoy this game as much as I did or will it be be a flop?"

,Recommended,537110,33042944,Posted: 30 June,all,Lia,"I've always been a fan of the Horror RPG Adventure genre, so once I've started playing Angels of Death, it just clicked in naturally for me (I should also note that; I've NEVER completely finished a true Horror RPG Adventure title before, so it was the first time for me with Angels of Death!) However it is not a perfect nor a complete game, it certainly has some downfalls, with Gameplay Aspects, Dialogue Pacing, a few Textbox Errors (which was a huge pain) and the unfortunate Translation mishap.What makes Angels of Death stick out the most from the genre was; their Characters, Worldbuilding, Theme & Storytelling! I’d find myself feeling invested in the story, wanting to learn more about the characters and backstory (which is currently possible, though the lack of any English Official Translation of the Angels of Death Manga series)The worldbuilding may seem lacking, but would come through very subtly and unappreciated! (something that I admire a lot!) And as for the character development… it just leaves me very speechless; I could only assume it would be a, “You either Love them or Hate them” scenario, but in MOST cases it would be the former.What I do praise the game the MOST was for the Character Designs! They are all equally memorable for the low numbers of casts (in their respected themes) making them very unique and complementary to each other!The Soundtrack however was not very well balanced throughout the entire game; so it was rare for me to find a track I REALLY enjoyed, or find it to be awfully unfitting (for the appropriate theme or timing)As I mentioned before, the Dialogue Pacing in the game wasn’t Angels of Death strong suit; but I would give credit for the game’s attempt of changing the gameplay pacing and theme in each Episode! For me, I very much appreciate the game for keeping me on my toes, during each Credits sequence!!MY FINAL OVERVIEW IS; I would ‘Love’ to replay Angels of Death in due time, once it receives an Improved and Finalised Update on the Translations, that would do justice on Angels of Death!Till then, I still find myself feeling very disappointed on the misuse of rephrasing, it’s a shame that 星屑KRNKRN’s games (especially a PAID game) would have to receive this kind of treatment on their work.But for anyone looking to try out the game, I encourage you to give Angels of Deaths a shot! It’s definitely a game you shouldn’t miss, especially from the Horror RPG Adventure Library.I guarantee that you would find ‘some kind of “weird” enjoyment’ from the game, for its unique charms!"

But turns more into an adventure game when you have a serial killer as a friend. Didnt think i would like a serial killer as much as i did. The games story is amazing. Though there are a few unanswered questions by the end of the game. Controls are as you expect from a rpg maker game. Not great but not bad either. Soundtrack was nice but sometimes feels a little out of place. Not too many jumpscares. I'll give it a 8/10.

I can honestly say that this was a fantastic game and a refreshing experience for someone who has played many rpgmaker-esque horror games. A lot of the moments had me genuinely concerned as to where the plot was going to go, since ususally I can sense things like ""plot twists"" and other cheesy turns, but there were moments that just kept me guessing.Some of the banter between the two MCs is genuinely hilarious and I wasn't expecting much considering Zach looks like a 13 year old's creepypasta OC, but he's such a fleshed out and somehow loveable character.

Puzzles were pretty cool.  Certain events got your heart pumping.  For the price it was definately worth the buy for at bare minimum a very good story full of seriously messed up characters.  If you enjoy psycho thriller horror movies then this will def peak your interest.  The game wasn't very difficult btw (or at least I had no real issues).  I did have to reload a couple of times but for the most part it was pretty straight forward.

The graphics are nothing to write home about and the game play isn't exactly challenging. The story is excellent however with dark religious undertones and is absolutely unique to anything I've read/played in a while. If you like serial killers, psycho little girls, watching serial killers/psycho little girls become best pals, and manga-esque narratives, it's fabulous."

I picked it up thinking it might be along the lines of Corpse Party (which I thoroughly enjoyed), only to find it was something quite different. And yet, still quite enjoyable!You play as Rachel Gardner, a girl trapped in some strange building with stranger people and the strangest things happen. All of it is quite strange, really. Her goal, which should be obvious, is to escape the strange building. Her success falls on your hands.GameplayThe game plays much like any other RPG Maker game does. Your controls are fairly basic, with a button for the menu, a button to interact, and a button to run faster. I played this game on an XBOX 360 controller, because I found it easier than the keyboard.The game shifts from adventuring to escaping to puzzling throughout the story. One minute you may be figuring out how to open a door, the next you may be running for your life. Thankfully, the game is very kind and gives you an opportunity to save before every event that may result in your death. Still, there were a few events where I got frustrated from having to retry five or six times to get the timing just right.StoryThe story is definitely engaging overall, but there were times where certain lines of dialogue and exchanges would make me do a double-take, as if they made no sense for the character or the setting. Still, the ending took me for a surprise and I found myself eager to keeping moving forward throughout the entire game.The game is episodic (sort of), divided into 4 chapters. The only way to switch from one chapter to the next was to quit the game and relaunch it, and select your chapter from the launcher. That was a bit of an annoyance, to be sure.Oh, and the story seems to be set up where you would be given some pivotal choices that impact the ending. Cool, right? Except you don’t actually get to make the choices. The game makes them for you. So that was disappointing.Why I hated itI’m going to cut this review down to two sections instead of three, simply because the game was so short, and jump right to my favourite part: Why I hated it!The graphics in the game were a little unnerving, especially the hand drawn character portraits. While they weren’t necessarily poor artwork, something was a little off.Also, I was not a fan of the way the game teased you about having choices to make, and then laughing in your face when you were railroaded into one choice.Final RecommendationIt was fun. I enjoyed it, overall. I’ll probably not play it again, but for 10 bucks I would say I got value for my money. It’s worth it - if you like creepy games."

So, I guess I'll start out with the bads and then finish strong with the selling points of the game. One of the ""meh"" parts of the game is the soundtrack... It doesn't make me feel certain emotions when they're played as well as I'd like, and everything just sounds the same throughout the game, but not really... I'm not sure if that makes sense but whatever. Other minor flaws include annoying sfx that play too often, and the occasional typo in the dialogue. With the bad out of the way, lets talk about the stuff that makes this game SUPER FANTASTICLY AWESOMELY EPIC!!! I LOVE the characters, from their artwork to their dialogue, they all manage to keep me engaged till the very end. The story itself is pretty good too. The plot twist had me so off guard, and the ending is a real tear jerker! The game comes with a few minigames and some (simple) escape puzzles to keep the game feeling fresh until the very end. I don't know how to end one of these reviews so I'll just give a summary of a sort: It's not the perfect game ever, but the characters and story made up for what the game lacks. I highly reccomend this to anyone that is eager to play a new game, with a fantastic story and characters!"

What lacks is a solid gameplay design.- An AWFUL LOT of false choises (Choose A: go on. Choose B: nothing happens)- Sometimes there are not corssable tiles here and there- No real consequence in every single way and danger is ALWAYS announced, utterly destoing suspance after half of the first chapter.I'd suggest the author(s) to continue this way: the idea behind the game is really good and just needs a more expert person on the game design itself.To other players I warn you spoiler free: the story is quite good, your choise will not matter at all: you will be given at any time just one correct answer and no consequence ever if you take the other one. It's a game with just one story, no real danger or challenge and no possibility to go offtrack. The story, however, it's kinda good as I alredy said. Nothing exceptional however, but interesting.

Their first game was already noteworthy for the incredible character development and heart-wrenching friendship but this is on a completely different level. This game is very dialogue heavy and you will spend more time reading than actually playing, so if you're heavily into gameplay and couldn't care less about plot this isn't for you. If you want to become an emotional wreck, then this is exactly what you need! Each of the 4 episodes is about 2 hours long each, so what you're paying for is 8 hours of pain.As a longtime fan of RPGM horror games, I think it's great.

Just know what you're getting into.Pros:1. Zack.2. Well-timed wubs. There aren't a lot of wubs, but the wubs that are there are all very well-timed.3. Peepers.Cons:1. It ends. It doesn't end badly. It's actually a great and personally really satisfying ending, but it still ends.2. If you still think it's a game, it's pretty short, only 1-2 hours per episode. It's not a game, and that's standard time for an OVA, but there you have it.3.

As I saw the increasing popularity in Japan I was PRAYING for an english release because I wanted my friends to go through the same enjoyment I did earlier, and behold! It finally happened.So, overall this game is about 8 hours of play time, which is perfectly worth the 10 dollars, I say.The two MCs have a beautifully written dynamic that make them both enjoyable. The plot seems simple first glance but it becomes more deep, complicated as you go through the episodes. I can't express how much I love the entire plot, and just Rachel and Zack as characters.I definitely am not a fan of /playing/ horror games, but this one I finished in about two sittings. There are chase scenes, but they're fairly simple, and allow you to save before they happen so you get a fair warning (which I'm thankful for, actually). Most of the ""horror"" comes from the ambience and little sounds, that kept me on the edge during a lot of moments. Overall, this game felt more of a thriller to me. Nonetheless, the story is the BEST *BEST* part of this game! Not to mention the BGM is also very beautiful, if you like some piano, techno and even dubstep?

The gameplay can be a little strange when trying to run and turn, but otherwise it was fairly easy and simple. The characters are very loveable and each unique, if not all crazy of course. It would be neat to see a second game or something added onespecially because I want to know what happens with Ray and Zach. Does he kill her after taking her, or do they end up living together or something? Like I need to know and need closure on that.I suggest getting the game if you have the money to enjoy the story for yourself. Each episode was only a few hours long. The puzzles aren't too difficult, though I ended up having a little bit of trouble on one of them because I went dumb.  You have plenty of time for most of the puzzles and you save right before anything too crazy happens. The soundtrack is enjoyable as well and seems to fit well at most parts. I find myself listening to it every now and then. The soundtrack can be found in the games files too, which is nice.For some reason I couldn't take screenshots during gameplay, so that was a little disappointing for me. Also when you download the game, your antivirus may want to delete some files, stating that the files are dangerous and it's trojan. Just make sure to exclude the game before downloading or if you've already downloaded the game, turn your antivirus off, then verify the games files. When your antivurs turns back on, allow the files it will want to delete when it asks for your input.That's all I've got to say. Get the game. Play it and enjoy it. Also there is a manga under the name Angel of Slaughter (Satsurika no Tenshi), it's not Officially translated in English, and an anime adaption is in the works. So once playing the game you can get excited for that. Anyways I hope to see a second game or a finale conclusion to the story (as I stated earlier) because to me it still needs a little something extra there at the end."

But Very few can disagree when those who have played this say that this gem was absolutely beautiful.- The game is very easy and is a straight shot through for anyone who doesn't like difficult puzzles but still wants a story. The same can be said for anyone who just wants a game to enjoy. The controls were also very simple.- The characters show a blended mixture that has and at the same time, has NOT been seen before. There are more twists, turns and shadows than most can count but placed together to slowly peice the story together perfectly at the end.Amazing how something so dark can be so warming and so beautiful... If you are curious and want to explore the story or if you are looking for a good time passer, this game is highly recommended. Either way, it is incredibly difficult to even think about being disappointed here.Score - 10 out of 10"

The characters are frustrating as they keep repeating that they want to die or that they want to kill someone. It is incredibly boring because there is practically no exciting gameplay. An accurate estimate of how much of this game is boring, cringy dialogue is 80%.This ""horror"" game has no horror aspect to it, has only one rubbish jumpscare that you probably won't notice and does not make you feel any sense of fear or anxiety (mostly all you feel is boredom and an urge to skip as much dialogue as possible). Before I gave in and couldn't be bothered to play anymore, I found myself skipping every piece dialogue I could. This game is comparable to no other RPG horror game I have seen. There are many much better games in this genre which can be downloaded for free such as Ib and Mad Father. These are much better than this terrible game I paid £7 for."

I reccommend this game so so much, especially if you're into story-laden games. The story and main characters are wonderfully fleshed out and I never thought I'd end up loving them as much I do now. The writing is wonderful and what I love about this specific developer is that their stories tend to bring you to another world. Like Forest of the Drizzling Rain, Angels of Death immerses you into a world with details and backstories that are so carefully mapped out. In these games there's always something foreboding lurking, and it is up to us, the players, to unravel these mysteries and in the process, bond with the characters living in it.10/10 would sob uncontrollably again"

,Recommended,537110,29451049,Posted: 23 January,all,wooguy,"Hot diggity. I'll tell you what - I really wasn't browsing the Steam Store for something like this. Here I was, just trawling through my recommendations for some dungeon crawler or something, and this caught my eye.I'll be honest, from the tags I wasn't sure if it would be my sort of thing, and I had to read more to see exactly what I was looking at, and it just made me even more curious. So naturally, I had to go ahead and see what it was all about......and I don't regret that decision AT ALL. Sure, it may have been a fairly short lived ride, but still relatively decent, especially for the price, which is very fair for the length of the content. Now, as for the content itself, let me tell you, it was a real ride. I mean, I could see the main plot from the description itself, that much is made plain. They gotta sell the storyline somehow, right? And that is probably the best thing they could have told you to get you interested. The reasons I had to find out: ""What leads to this situation? Why does this happen? And most importantly, how does it end up???"" Well, the storyline has it all, and it's done in a way to keep you gripped. It's kind of like reading a great book - only, you can mess up and have something go wrong, and there's some things you have to figure out all by yourself before you can keep reading. (ya know, gameplay!) And NO, there's no way you'd get to hear anything more about the storyline from me. That would completely defeat the purpose of you even getting this!I loved this story. And the way it was presented through the gameplay made it that much more enjoyable. I'll be frank in that the gameplay elements are not a majority part of this - there's a little exploration and figuring things out, but a decent amount of it could be seen as merely advancing plot. However, I personally saw it all as a means to tell a story, which is why I thought it fit so well! It's definitely an experience, and you should definitely consider giving it a go for yourself, if you think you would also enjoy it!Who knows? Maybe I'll give it a few years, and only remember bits and pieces of this story. Perhaps I will have the desire to see it all again. If it came to that, I would probably embark upon it once more."

The dynamic between the two main characters is unique and uncommon so it provides not only witty and new interactions between characters but also gave the player a different perspective on the game itself but also the supporting characters aren't anything to laugh at either because of the way they only improve upon the story and narrative, however if I had to be critical I would of liked the reasons of one of the main villians to be more understandable and more realistic however that can't be expected due to the style of the game. The controls are classic Jrpg so are easy to understand if you are a fan of that style of game and the graphics are nice and look good with the story its trying to convey.If you liked this I would highly recommend 'Forest of the Drizzing Rain' which was produced by the game creator and has a similar art style and gameplay. However Forest of the Drizzing Rain does have a more soft plot compare to Angel of death and it does have elememts of romance within the narrative and endings."

I have not felt this emotionally attached to a game since silent hill 2 or more recently Fran Bow. I have played very few RPGs of this kind (really only one), but found the gameplay to be immersive in a way I didn’t expect, even more so than many of the “higher graphic” games I have played, and while I could continue about the gameplay I think what stood out for me, and made this a really special experience was the relationship between Rachel and Zach and their interactions with each other as well as the whole story line put together. What was really exciting about this for me was that there was this cute relationship building between these two polar opposite characters and so many funny and “aww” moments (which is important to me because I’m a girl and like that kind of thing), but you were still in this world full of blood and gore and mayhem and it still managed to be terrifying and creepy AF at the same time. That is a very hard balance to achieve, and this game delivered on every level. I honestly didn’t want it to end. In conclusion, this game is amazing, and I sincerely hope that more media ( like the manga and novel) are translated into English, so I can stop longingly looking at the Japanese scans, hoping that the story can one day continue for me."

A bonus for people who like dark stories with dark humour.+You'll find yourself liking all of the characters, The 2 MCs are actually complex in their own regards, especially Ray. The other characters they go against have their own little charm.+The whole setting itself entertaining, like a screwed up survival game testing you in different ways, depending on the owner of the floor.+ Games gives you leeway with it's puzzles such as auto saves which is useful if you are the type that sucks at puzzles and chase scenes and so on.Cons:-That being said, the puzzles for me tended to be a bit too easy. The game gives you several hints which is good but at times it's to the point where it almost tells you what to do. I never really felt scared of losing in any threatening puzzles or think that much on how to solve them.Overall, this is a game with great characters, a fun and emotional story near the end.

While people might say that's just cliche, the anime elements actually play well into this game.The ending was not horrible, but it wasn't the best. The producer intentionally prolonged the last chapter. The story could have ended perfectly at several certain points, but just as you'd expect to see the credits, a new event takes place.

The characters are interesting and the music is good enough, if you are a sucker for bitersweet stories or for interesting killer designs then this is is pretty good.HOWEVERThis is far from the best game of its kind that I´ve played and far from some of the best videogames stories I´ve played, I think you could enjoy the story a lot more if it were given in a comic (webcomic, manga, whathever floats your boat) or something similar, a manga exists, it seems this game was a hit in japan so if you like the aesthetic/characters/concept I recommend you read that instead since the few gameplay bits are not enjoyable by themselves.I think there are 2 types of people who would enjoy this game1- People who LOVE rpg maker games like Mad Father or IB.2- People who never played an rpg maker game before.If you are either of those I truly recommend it, if not then aproach without high expectations"

The mechanics serve like that of any other horror RPG: picking up stuff, putting down stuff, and running away from anything that can move. Despite any sense of originality within the gamplay, the plot makes up for most of it. The story, while sometimes hard to follow, is quite interesting to say the least. The atmosphere which the player interacts with, while not at it's full potential, couples with the game pretty well. There aren't any small, worthless things to inspect. In fact, all you do inspect ends up being relevant to advance the game at some point or are just empty boxes. Angels of Death isn't very long, either. The game only lasts about 5-6 hours.Overall, the greatest, and some may say, only, selling point of this game is the strange but unique storyline. However, it is still a game worth playing simply to enjoy a new story.Oh, not to mention, I absolutely love the character designs."

The characters are interesting and the ending is kindof a fill in the blank but it works. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride. A lot of people seem to think this is a sad game but it made me smile more than anything.
