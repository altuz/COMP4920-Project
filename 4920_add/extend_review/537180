Yeah it's fun, but would you really want to play a game that is hard to even play through? Just think about that."

Very easy to control (player and the digimon)Cons :1. Is Pay To WINS!! Lot of items that u need to pay in cash! u cannot be a TOP player without Paying!2. To many BOTTER!! Yes, BOTTER!! every single player here using BOT! and they claim every spot of monster!! so U cant hunt cz u cant beat that botter!!3. U need to grinding for your item all the time,  85% of my gameplay is grinding and grinding, it's so bored!!4. Illegal Item Everywhere, Some Carding""er (someone who steal other credit to pay) buy a lot of CASH item and sellin in cheap for TERA (ingame Money) so they can sell TERA in REAL MONEY!! U can see this in DATS (main Town) a lot of store that put his number or contact for that!!5. EVERY EVENT on this game will give u do more GRINDING!!Conclusion :Dont waste your time on this game like i do, i'm Digimon Fans but this game is just BAD! if u insist then Play it with ur own risk. :D"

( after some searious time in this game i wanted to add some things )i made it to max level and max digimon level on my main digis.and i found the entire experiance of this game quite good.very nice game i reccomend it if you like digimon.or if you like to collect things.and they continue to update and fix issues that was reported big plus However it would seem developers and game masters are being taken away from digimon online and thus makeing the game harder to play since many new buggs been creeping out and not being crushed or communicated quickly enoughi still say its ok game but something needs to be done about the low numbers of support and game masters
,Recommended,537180,29956218,Posted: 15 February,all,.retarded|hobble,"I enjoy this game immensly. It's very simple yet very complex. I only play it casually over the past few months. I would compare it to playing WoW but only as the hunter. I haven't done any end game stuff as I just keep levelling up digimon instead of levelling just one. I have at least 20 of them and just about all are above level 40 because as soon as you hit file island you have a free pass to essentially take your higher level digimon and turn in the quests as a low level digimon. Easy way to get them levelled up quickly. I would reccommend this to anyone that enjoys mmos but doesn't neccessarily want to have to invest all their time to enjoy it. It's a fun game, but the community sucks as well. Most players don't like to party up to share xp, and good luck finding help in the chat function. The guides online are less than helpful as well imo but as I said I'm just playing to collect digimon"
,Not Recommended,537180,29711237,Posted: 4 February,all,reject217,"This was a good game when I played it. After a while, I stopped enjoying it. I enjoyed Digimon in the past, but, man, the grind game is real here. Say you found a spot where you can get a Digi-egg drop of your favorite Digimon. Now, spend about 2-3 hours to drop at least 3 of those eggs. Next, if you haven't done so already, grind specific data to hatch the Digi-egg. For the amount of data, it all depends on the egg. As for the time... difficult to gauge, but longer than an hour for around 30 data. After all is said and done, it's time to try to hatch the egg (the most nerve-racking and rage filled portion of this event). With regular egg drops and not those bought from the Cash Shop, you can very well lose the egg on your first attempt of hatching it. If you get the egg to level 3, you're in a decent spot. I say decent because it's the lowest you can hatch your Digimon at, which is most of the time under 100% of its full potential. If you want better than decent, pray to RNGesus that the attempt to level 4 doesn't break your egg. To get your egg into top tier, try your luck at level 5... Actually... just... no... slim to none chance of it actually reaching there... And that's just one thing that grinds my gears. If your Digimon aren't strong enough, you're gonna have a hard time advancing. Even your starting team (minus your starter) are below their full potenial, so doling out a lot of damage is difficult.To sum up a poor rant, head into the game if you just want a huge grind fest."

Seems like someone who knows very little English translated it.2. Text wrapping in chat windows from the NPCs for quests and cutscenes appears to be on character wrap instead of word wrap.  If I wasn't paying attention to it, I probably wouldn't notice but, on smaller resolutions, it gets really messed up results.The worst part about this is I only played for half an hour and couldn't continue as it was very jarring."

When I decided to give it a chance on Steam, I was considering buying some items with real money if the game had developed to a playable and enjoyable experience, but since my time with the pre-Steam version last year, not much has changed.  In fact, the only change I've noticed is I no longer need to double click to move and there's a red indicator to where you're moving."
,Not Recommended,537180,30026664,Posted: 18 February,all,Zero Chance!,"1. Pay to win. Very expensive. Many people 'card' the game once it's on steam.2. Too many bot. Some bot got banned, some still can roam freely. My guess is, this is the work of the Game Master. Negotiating with some of the player who is botting.3.  Few areas to farm. Once you are high leveled, there's only 1 place to farm, and that place is crowded as fish with botter. The game doesnt bother to add another channel. The game doesn't listen to its player.4. Too many 'carder'. The ingame item price drop to the ground. Some carder just doesn't bother and buy 3000+ Backup disk, 3000+ OCS and NCS and they sell the ingame cash for real money. The GM doesn't bother. All you can see in DATS Center is carder promoting their shop. Again, the GM doesn't care.5. People using bug for instance dungeon. The GM doesn't care. They fix it after all high level player got the good drop.The only pros is if you love mindless farming. I mean really mindless. Thousands of level up if you want to make the Susanoomon since you need 20 lv 99 digimon."

Its just that to be the best you have to pay cash, no way around it.sure i can hatch my 3/5 egg... but it will forever be locked at a dirt power level. if you want 4/5 or a 5/5 its extremley crazy difficult to get. and on top of that, you can still improve it with more RNG clone powerups. through +15 in each stat IIRC. which is crazy unlucky after +8 in every stat.digimon is fun, i just feel this game can be done a lot lot better than what were given here.TLDR - I always feel capable of doing things on my own, its quick to pick up the nature of the game and become effective regardless of your digimon choice. its not cash to win, but cash to advance after graciously long and satisfying intro."

76561198041163202,Not Recommended,537180,30249268,Posted: 28 February,all,Lorza,"In the beginning this game was fun to play but after a while I got the feeling that I was not completly rewarded for the hours I put on this game. The RNG is incredibly horrible/low when you are grinding to get the materials you need or when you try to hatch a digimon, I had 10 Keramon Digieggs and around 500 data chips, which is needed to hatch digimon and it varies, in my case it was 8 data chips were used every time and you need to have minium 3 succesful tries to hatch a digimon.The controls are easy and I liked them. It is easy to move, attack and use items. This area I had no problem with and would like to other MMORPG use something like this. The HUD interface was alright I guess, but it looked a little outdated.If you are one of those that just play games with good graphics then this game is definetly not for you. The graphics look like a game from PS2, it is very childish and not detailed.Now about the quests, there are three types of quests, there is ""Main Quests"", ""Side Quests"" and ""Daily Quests"". After a few hours of gameplay I got lost and did not know which kind of quest I was doing. Sure they got a litlle box that tells which quest you can do, but it lacked information. If you decide to play, be prepared to the lack of information that will be in the quest description, I personally did not understand sometimes and had to ""google"" it.Due to the bad RNG in the game, at some point you might consider to buy a digimon that can be hatched with its worst or best stats. This pretty much ruined for me because I might not play as much as I did before.Short summary; childish graphics, bad RNG, good controls, variation of quest which is good so that you do not grind all the time and bad system on obtaining new digimon."

,Recommended,537180,29643936,Posted: 1 February,all,✨Parado✨,"I played this game when the english language version was in Closed Beta, and on and off sine then. Basically, if you're a Digimon fan, go ahead, try it, if you're not, this is a very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.Objectively speaking, this is one ofn the most generic cookie cutter MMOs I have ever played, it brings absolutely nothing nre to the table and is grindy as all hell. Some like to say it's P2W, but I disagree, you can do everything without paying a single buck, with the drawback of it probably taking you your whole life, as you slowly waste away to dust. Occasionally you'll get a fetch quest (keep in mind 75% of the game is fetch quests) that refuses to let you get the required drops, and you'll be stuck grinding for hours and give up because why waste your time.As a Digimon fan? It's fun. I coughed up the 10 or so bucks to get my favorite 'mon directly from the cash shop with items to get it to a decent size (the size percentage of your Digimon when it hatches is a permanent stat boost, RNG as ♥♥♥♥ without cash). It's still super grindy but it's a bit more tolerable when you're working towards the goal of evolving the very special computer gremlin you got with your hard earned money. There's a pretty solid guide that speeds things up too. There's a lot of Digimon available, so you're gonna have at least ONE of your favorites in the game for sure. As far as I know, every main digimon from seasons 1-5 of the show are available either through grinding or coughing up the funds. Unfortunetly the Xros Wars/Fusion cast isn't in any version of this game besides the Korean version, and I doubt Global servers will get them anytime soon. There's also a lot of neat areas inspired by the shows, like most of File Island from Digimon Adventure. Korean version also has some Xros Wars/Fusion zones, but again, not in this server yet (if it ever comes).Outside of gameplay, thought I should mention that there are many non-english speaking players (I play on Lilithmon server), not that it's a bad thing, as it is the Global version of the game, and most team effort content doesn't need you to talk at all, just figure it's something worth pointing out ahead of time to avoid language barrier frustations if you decide you actually WANT to interact with human beings in a a game about fictional computer code creatures.This game is absolutely horrible but I'll say give it a shot if you're a Digimon fan, at the very least it's great service to fans if you just want to get your favorite Digimon and kill some time, honestly."

I spent a fair ammount on purchasing Digi Eggs, and I want to play the game on that account. However, the steam version of this game does not allow you to log in to your old accounts, or merge with them. Not even to restore your old purchases. Unless this is corrected, I won't be playing it anytime soon."

Seriously, it is ruining our childhood.I played every other digimon game, from digimon world 1 to digimon rpg, the korean one at its prime, and this game is no where even near any of them. Digimon RPG, a game made in 2004, has better graphics and much much better gameplay than this. Grinding for hours was fun with such games, but then this thing, it's just annoying whatever you try to do.Just looking at it will make you sick. You will stumble upon countless glitches and bugs within the first hour of the game and it never stops. Do they care? No.I mean you can download Unity for free and a couple of free assests from the Unity store, and in a couple of hours, you are going to achieve better results than this game has ever achieved since its first release. It's that bad. They should just take it off steam."

Bad translations and the hatching system (basically if you want to get a specific digimon there's a good chance you'll break the egg and waste it, making it hard to craft your team to what you want at first) are big downsides but beyond that it's a pretty enjoyable MMO."

DO NOT PLAYreiterate the game is flat out crus, the devs don't care about anything more than how much money they can wring out of chumps, the game has horrendous crashing issues, is devoid of anything remotely relating to story, is nearly impossible to grind in without spending money, even core mechanics like digivolving and jogresses are blatant cash grabs just skip, stop reading and go back to the rpg or mmo section and download the myriad of actually decent games there is nothing in this pile of wasted data worth anything not even for the most rabid of digimon fans"

Besides all of that, it's a great mmorpg, particularly for those who are fans of the previous single player games, shows and movies,"
