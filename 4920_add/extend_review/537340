,Recommended,537340,30594836,Posted: 18 March,all,[ARX]AnthonyPS,"Note: As a comedy game, Guts and Glory attracts a lot of non-serious/meme/troll reviews. These (unfortunately) highly popular so-called reviews do not help people who are considering to purchase this game. Feel free to read mine if you're looking for a serious, informative review that helps you get an in-depth look on the game's worth.IntroductionGuts and Glory is a gore comedy,  ragdoll physics, level-based-obstacle-racing indie game made by HakJak Productions. The gameplay in general is obviously inspired by the legendary web browser-based platform gore comedy game: Happy Wheels. In case you are not familiar with Happy Wheels' gameplay, it is basically a race to the finish line using various kinds of vehicles, with a twist. The 'race track' is usually entirely covered with traps, turrets, mines, and other ridiculous obstacles that will cut (or blow) your character to pieces. Happy Wheels itself thrived through community-made maps that allows map creators to challenge other players to finish their track - Guts and Glory also supports this feature.A heads up for sensitive people: The core entertainment of the game is dark humor. Don't be shocked when a child character got mutilated by flying saws, flattened by cannonballs, or crushed by massive logs. Avoid this game if you will be offended or made uncomfortable by these kinds of jokes.Pros+ Players can create their own maps through Steam Workshop+ Both funny and challenging at the same time. Guts and Glory makes failing a level a hilarious experience.+ I read somewhere that the devs produced their own soundtrack. This is definitely worth mentioning since the soundtrack is quite enjoyable.+ Unlike a lot of other early access games, you can play all that the game has to offer without any issues+ Different vehicles offer different features and controls, offering extra gameplay variance e.g. Nitrous on cars and backflip/front flip on bikes+ Funny, outrageous scenario for each level e.g. 'visiting' your neighbors by smashing through their houses with an ATV+ Track challenges varies - not everything is about dodging arrows and cannonballsCons- Clunky, unresponsive control. Probably made this way on purpose to support the comedy/meme aspect but I don't find it enjoyable- Map creators might find it tedious having to upload their maps to Steam Workshop instead of being instantly accessible in-game. Compared to Happy Wheels, Guts and Glory's user-generated content receives much less attention. I assume this issue is caused either by lack of Steam users' interest to look around the Community (i.e. Library - Play - Quit kind of guy) or the difficulty of creating their own map compared to Happy Wheel's simplistic Flash Player platform design.- Levels that are too difficult to finish can lock players from progressing further & enjoy variation. Although this is purely subjective, a 'Skip Level' option would be great, or simply unlock every level from the start.- The Yang Family car trip level is taking way too long with minimum obstacles- Checkpoints need to be re-calibrated with the level's obstacles. Put checkpoints before difficult obstacles, not before a long, empty road.ConclusionNote that these are based on assumptions because I have never made a map myself and I'm terribly inexperienced in creating my own map, thus please correct me if I said anything wrong.Of course, as an early access, Guts and Glory still has a long way to go. They still need to add more content to keep the users engaged (I heard they're working on flying vehicles?) and I'm glad that the devs are still actively developing the game.  If I may give a suggestion, devs should create a map editor template to allow users easily create maps by themselves and challenge their friends. Happy Wheels lives for a long time due to this user-generated system, I'm sure Guts and Glory can go for the same strategy.For such cheap price, it's worth it to purchase Guts and Glory. Plus, it's also always nice to support indie game developers with good quality games. If you enjoyed Happy Wheels, you'll enjoy Guts and Glory. The hilarity of the gameplay  definitely has more value than the price.I hope my review can be helpful for you - thank you for reading!"

The controls are way too sensitive, if you so much as go left or right you fly torwards jupiter and it sucks when you have to make careful turns. This also makes some of the levels terrible. I want to love this game but I just can't because the controls are so frustrating to deal wth."

,Recommended,537340,29973265,Posted: 16 February,all,Yeti,"Guts and Glory is a Happy Wheels-inspired 3D platformer racing game created by solo developer HakJak. Just like Happy Wheels, it has various characters that can be played through difficult levels ranging from races to cannon filled death traps. Though there are a lot of comparisons to Happy Wheels, Guts and Glory is it's own game and will become more unique as the game progresses. The game also comes with an easy to use level editor and workshop support. It is very early alpha, however, and is lacking a lot of content, UI, settings, and some polish but there is plenty to do with the editor and workshop support.Guts and Glory is about skill and chaos, speeding through race tracks, death traps, and whatever else HakJak and the community can come up with to send your character flying in as many peices as possible. Currently there is John and Jimmy, the classic Dad-Son bicycle combo, Earl the gun carrying redneck on an ATV, the Yang family in their convertible car, and Larry the crazy sonuvab*tch with a jet powered lawn chair. There are planned to be 12 total different playable characters so it will be interesting to see what else HakJak can come up with to add to the chaos.Mechanically the game is pretty solid. The physics are accurate, the dismemberment is precise and gory, the ragdolls are hilarious, the destruction physics on both environment and vehicles is satisfying, and the game overall plays very smoothly. The only thing noticeable that needs work at first is the movement of some of the characters, it takes some getting used to but it's nothing significant.All in all Guts and Glory is a game that fills a hole not many games can, Happy Wheels being the most noteable. It's a game of trials, skill, and just enjoying losing by watching your character get chopped, sliced, smashed, and torn to pieces in the most entertaining way possible in creative levels made by HakJak and the workshop community. For $10 I think this game is completely worth it if you're into survival racing/trial/skill games both because it's a blast to play and you're supporting a hard-at-work solo developer doing his best to deliver a fantastic game."

,Not Recommended,537340,34698417,Posted: 2 September,all,Uncle Triggey,"While it is pretty funny to watch Mr. Yang drive his about-to-explode car around while his bloody one armed wife barely clings off the side, the game doesn't add up very well. First off the controls are so bad they might as well start a political debate. A easy way to describe them is that you can only go one direction at a time. Like if you turn left you stay that way until you turn right, and it takes a long time for it to calibrate it forward, but by the time you are forward little Jimmy's legs are back at the checkpoint. Second off, the game runs very laggy. Not at a stop motion level but like just under a perfect amount. And it has a habit to increase the lag even under the least bit of in game action. Thirdly the game just looks plain bad, even for a early game. The levels look like something for a Seinfeldspitstain video, and they have a problem were you can just drive off course and go on forever until you fall of the map. Overall, don't but this game just spend those 10 dollars on TF2"

It has plenty of tracks, a track editor and full workshop support so you should find it hard to run out of things to do.The graphics are simplistic but functional for this sort of game, you really don't want anything too realistic when you're dismembering your family in game.The controls are somewhat sketchy at times, or more accurately the vehicles are. The bike is by far the best of the three vehicles on offer and is easily the most fun. The quad is my least favourite as it just doesn't really do anything for me, it never produces the comical outcomes that the bike does. The sports car is just plain annoying and drifts all over the place, far better suited to more open road tracks. That said, even if you don't like any vehicle but the bike, it's worth getting as this vehicle makes the game.The developer has been very active on the forum, taking feedback and releasing patches regularly. I recommend this game if you're after a good time with increasing community content on the way each day."

Inspired by Happy Wheels, you can defintely feel the similarities of this spiritual successor.While there are many pros to this game, all I feel I have to say is this:You can decapitate your wife and child by accidentally (or not accidentally) driving into precariously swinging saw blades, while in your yellow convertable, and then skid down a mountain, fly out of your seat, because you're too stupid to use a seatbelt, hold onto your car door for dear life, and then get slammed through your windshield, face-first, when you eventually hit the ground.And then get your torso torn off your dying body by a stray cannonball.So yes, I recommend this."

76561198090757791,Recommended,537340,30106017,Posted: 22 February,all,"""Tricky"" Ricky Stern","General Thoughts:Fairly similar to Happy Wheels in premise, gorey, explosive fun with a slightly disappointing lack of squishiness of the NPCs, objects, vehicles and player characters.The NPCs, environment and objects all look nice and the physics are very fun. Driving can be frustrating at times (such as on the bicycle), but at other times (such as with the car) it can be as fun as the explosions and flying around itself.Overall it is a very well put together game and has enormous potential.Things I would like to see:Regarding mechanics, the ability to move outside of your vehicle; some of the best levels in Happy Wheels are the ones you at some point eject from your vehicle and grab on to something. Also, squishier people, and objects.Regarding levels, it would be cool to see the quality  evolve into what you see with its inspiration: well crafted, good looking levels without the empty expanses that are so prominent in those both community made and, to a lesser extent the official levels.Things I think could improve:Camera angles, more options with checkpoints and objectives (such as options in paths)"

The obstacles are mostly artificial: mines, bombs, arrows, saws, ... With a very low degree of realism.Rather than only the stupid mines, bombs, arrows, etc... you'd expect things like a truck getting in your way and decapitating you instead of same lame random saws flying around. The mines, bombs, arrows, ... would be fine in their own seperate level(s), but everywhere no ty?Besides that there are more issues, which they might fix. To name a few: handling is terrible (even the freaking quad seems to do nothing but sliding, 0 traction). Low amount of vehicle choises (4).Eventhough it's in beta I can't really imagine this game evolving into something I recommend. Atm it's a poor 3d version of existing 2d flash verions."

Thank you!!!The hate that I saw from the negative reviews this game gets is pretty harsh. It's not as bad as people say, I have watched MattShea and Jacksepticeye play this game in their YouTube videos and they had no big issue getting past all the official levels and I haven't had any massive trouble on one level except Log Rolling but that is supposed to be hard. Its only one level that anyone would have an issue with so if its too hard for them for all the other levels, don't freaking give a negative review just because you suck. -.-The controls for the bike, ATV, Yang Family and rocket chair are all pretty good. People say the rocket chair is the hardest but I find it the easiest actually once you learn how to fly around. I also controlled all the vehicles with an old controller that has a loose left stick and its still decent, except when I want to go straight without turning cause the controller is well used. So, to the people that say the controls suck, its not the game, its YOU. The YouTubers I watch were perfectly fine with the controls and I was fine as well with them.People said the music is horrible, they are very wrong on that, there are quite a few levels I went back to just because of the music alone even though the levels were also epic. No idea why the music is getting so much hate when its actually good.For a $10 game and a huge variety of good workshop levels I downloaded, this is a really great game. This is not a rip off of Happy Wheels, its more like a parody of it. Someone enjoyed Happy Wheels to the point where they wanted to make a 3D version of it and has done an amazing job with quite a lot of stuff in this game.Yes, some things are from Happy Wheels but there are many things that are unique to this game that Happy Wheels doesn't have. Who cares if it is a rip off anyway? We love it, we have fun with it, we enjoy the crazy gore and there are no stupid ***** girl glitches or 99% impossible levels being spammed."

Then I bought the early access release... and the gameplay hadn't changed at all. The only new feature was a new vehicle,better gore, and a couple  maps. For $10, this is disgraceful. Early access doesn't give a pass on a etremely basic game: once you start charging money, you had better have enough stuff already implimented to make it worth the money."

It is a lot like a 3 dimentional Happy Wheels game. The reason I say that others may not like it is because it can be hard to navigate the controls, and one may find themselves more aggravated at trying to play the game then they would find themself enjoyfully challenged by it. It all depends on the person playing. That's my opinion of it anyway. I did a Let's Play on the game. It would mean the world to me if anyone who is interested could check it out. I'll put a link to it below. Have a wonderful day.https://youtu.be/AzQ6OLAtPnc"

,Not Recommended,537340,30047955,Posted: 19 February,all,Malcolm Tucker,"""Based on"" is used loosely as almost all aspects of Happy Wheels is present: Son and Father character, exact same controls, user powered game. At least they could have thanked Jim Bonacci for STEALING his game and only making it 3d to ""change"" it. I will admit it has a lot of potential, but seeing as its early access and a rip off of a browser game theres not much to do. The game loses its playability after 30 minutes in, and thats only the very limited official maps wherein you are confined to a single character(like in happy wheels). One or two official maps let you use any character, but mostly it makes you use one specific character. These are the ""character"" introduction levels at the game seems to implying theres a story. If you have played Happy Wheels then you can see this one coming: community maps. Since the game was recently released, there are no good player created maps. Most are 10 seconds long, pander to a youtuber, or (you guessed it) are spike falls."

However, it only manifested itself on Guts and Glory for almost 2 weeks.
