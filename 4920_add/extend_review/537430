,Not Recommended,537430,31833239,Posted: 18 May,all,Azralynn,"See written review belowor watch it here:https://youtu.be/KdrGxVGEPr0TL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION!Inner Chains is a beautiful mess of a first person shooter adventure. The story opens up with a very intriguing opening cinematic, but unfortunately, that’s about all the story you seem to get. You play as a character in this dystopian biomechanial world, and you are on a mission to escape this hostile place. That’s about all of the story that I understood, and the game doesn’t make much else clear. I don’t know if I just somehow missed the entire story while playing, but the opening cinematic felt like the only part of the story to me.Gameplay wise, the first chapter of the game felt like a surreal walking simulator. Walking around, and pressing tablets, having some bizarre visions, and then moving forward to find the next one. It wasn’t until chapter two that you get weapons, and the action begins.The weapons were actually interesting, and I liked their functionality. Aside from combat, you also need them to progress through the world by electrifying control consoles that are out of reach, or burning down barriers. Each of the three weapons has its own ammo type that you replenish at the booths found around the levels. Not only do these booths replenish ammo, but your health as well. They were generally positioned well, and frequently enough that you can keep topped up, and not have to worry too much about your overall ammo supply. If you do happen to run out of ammo on one of your weapons, you can still fire it, but you will take health damage for doing it. The weapons will overheat, and go on a short cooldown to keep you from spamming them too much. Overall, the gunplay is alright, it’s not great, but it’s not too bad for the most part.Pros:opening cinematic is interesting, and done very wellinteresting weapons that you need for both combat and progression through the worldgraphics are excellent: all of the environments look amazing and the stylistic design of the game is fantasticthe music and ambience are decent enough to enjoy the atmosphereCons:performance is atrocious - if it was just minor frame drops here and there, it might be okay, but there are so many times where the game stutters and lags hardcore, to the point where it is briefly unplayable (on max settings using Win10, i7-6700k, 32GB RAM, GTX 1070)there are a ton of spots where you can noclip through parts of the terrain, and see through walls; it definitely hurts any sense of immersion that the game might have hadafter the opening cinematic, there doesn't seem to be any story (or at least not any that was made clear to me)[bug] game breaking bug that you can reproduce causing crashes to desktop (in at least one part of the game)[bug] during the final boss fight I couldn't figure out what to do, and the boss wasn’t attacking me, so I climbed up and jumped around the final, skipping the boss entirely, and rolling the credits[bug] some issues where the enemies you burn don't catch on fire[bug] you will take damage or die from enemies on the other side of pillars that have no line of sight on you at all (they shoot through some things)[bug] some sound effects bug out occasionally and your weapons are silent(nitpick) melee attacks are extremely ineffective, and there doesn’t seem to be much point in even trying to punch things(nitpick) options menus are seriously lacking, and will not be enough for some people (while others might not care)(nitpick) keyboard and mouse controls are not customizable, but most people will be ok with the defaults (WASD, EF, Shift, Crtl, Mouse) - only partial controller support right nowThe game took me roughly 3-3.5 hours to get through the game, and I uninstalled immediately, and can’t see any reason to play again.Conclusion:Inner Chains looks fantastic, but sadly that’s about all the game has going for it. Along with the terrible optimization, there’s also noclip issues, and plenty of bugs. Some small bugs, but others that are game-breaking that ruin any fun you might have had. At this time, I strongly suggest avoiding Inner Chains.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curationshere.You can also view this review on my websitehere."
,Not Recommended,537430,31826381,Posted: 18 May,all,derSanitöter,"I'll do a short review - after 45 mins of gameplay, because i liked the trailers and bought it today.Pro:The trailers - they look good and made me buy it.That's it. I found nothing good about this game in 45 mins of gameplay. Nothing in this game makes me want to play it or go further in game progress. And the Cons will tell you why.Cons:The performance is the only nightmare in this game. The fps drop random from 100+ fps down to nightmarish 25-35 fps.Even if you achieved to keep 70+ fps there was a recurring ""lag"" or ""stutter"" ever 2-3 seconds. Like you game stops short and goes on ... and stops ... CPU and GPU clock remain at full clock.The graphics of this game is typical for Unreal Engine 4. Okay in most cases but i would never call it amazing.Looks pretty on screenshots but ingame it's allways kinda ""mehhh"".The sound design is very poor. Music is ok, but there are nearly no sound effects ingame in the first hour that it felt so empty and boring. Atmosphere? Not found.The story and gameplay of this game?Besides the intro there is in the first hour not that much seen or told what this all is.You walk around, follow the path, see, avoid hostile ""enemies"" ( something like plants ), interact with stuff you don't know and don't get information about. That's basically what you do until you find your first gun. So gameplay is really boring, story nearly untold and you really don't know what the heck to do besides walking around, opening gates, avoid or kill enemies. But it's done in such a boring and not-enjoyable way that i could not go on playing it.What's the nightmare in this game?The options ""menu"" with few options and not even a slider for mouse sensitivity - which is really annoying!The animations and the gameplay feels so wonky and ""not right"" - another gamebreaker for me.I jumped down some stairs - 1 meter down and died. Well ...Conclusion:In this current state - i would not buy it.It feels again like a UE4 techdemo - not more, not less.I really thought this game could deliver what the trailers promissed. I can not.There is so much to do, to fix, to optimize.Sorry, but i could not go on playing because nearly no atmosphere, lack of storytelling, stupidly walking around with the feeling of ""you no nothing jon snow"" which is not getting better at any time in the first 45 mins. And the stuttering and laggs are killing the game completly.The 2 rigs i tried and played this game on:AMD R7 1700X ( 8x 3.9 Ghz )16GB DDR4-2933GTX 1070 ( newest driver )game and OS on 2 different SSDsWin 10 ( game mode on/off tested )Intel i5 3570k ( 4x 4,6 Ghz )16GB DDR3-1600GTX 1070 ( newest driver )game and OS on 2 different SSDsWin 10 ( game mode on/off tested )"

76561198161629635,Recommended,537430,33162626,Posted: 2 July,all,knighttristen,"Artwork, aesthetics, narrative, and detail here are visually stunning. Inner Chains is one of the most heavy metal games I've ever played. (as far as visual design is concerned)As far as gameplay is concened, It's nothing like what the appearance might suggest... And it's not fun. This game begs to be an 90s-esque shooter, like Quake or Doom. But, nothing about playing the actual game here is fun. It's just really slow and tedious. Honestly this is my only big gripe about it. Yes it launched with some technical issues that made it almost unplayable, but most all of those problems have been remedied.Guns, while they look super bad♥♥♥♥♥ just aren't very effective or satisfying to use. But they do start syphoning your blood when you run out of ammo, which is kinda cool... In a weird, nasty, heavy metal way.I didn't really have ""fun"" playing this game, but I enjoyed experiencing the environment. I don't think this game is bad really at all, but I must admit that I am kinda dissapointed in it. I wish it was a 90s shooter, but insted its something like a walking/despair simulator with guns that sort of ""shoot"". I don't think it deserves a thumbs down at all, and I'm a little irritated that so many people gave it a bad rating based almost entirely on the now fixed performance issues. But at the same time I resist recomending it, because it's just not fun. I think it's worth playing though, but perhaps wait 'till it goes on sale."

The artstyle is something new, the environments look great and even little details like cloth look goodCon:-plays like they finished all the assets, art etc...and then had only 1 week left to cobble them together to the excuse of a game..no story, no performance..nothing"
76561197998944472,Recommended,537430,33119453,Posted: 2 July,all,plastic hand,"Well I loved the weird world and setting, artwork and environments were great.   I wouldn't recommend this for the game play as it was a bit boring  and  like doing house work.  Combat   needs a heck of  a lot of work. Also would be great to add some  puzzles too. Music is the same track played on repeat.  But I reccomend it if your'e  looking forward to other ""Hell-Scape"" worlds such as Scorn and Agony, this might be a prelude to those titles. Looking forward to  playing again if there is another patch   and seeing where the developer improves it."

,Not Recommended,537430,33849017,Posted: 27 July,all,that's what she said,"TL;DR: You'd wish it was a walking sim.See, Inner Chains is supposed to be dark and disturbing shooter, slow paced and tactical.First of all, yes it's distrubing, dark and oozing with atmosphere. And it looks absolutely amazing. Jaw dropping amazing.The setting is rather deep, but story is pretty much non-existant. To be fair it only adds to disjointed experience the game provides. I also has to mention narrator which does a proper job in broken english. It feels like he is disconnected from life, forgot how to speak properly and keeps drifting into his own thoughts.Now the problems:Yeah, the game is slow paced, but it isn't tactical. All the tactics involve 'use environment a bit'. What matters the game as an FPS does not work. Only one gun is actual gun and shoots. Two others are electro-thing and flamethrower. And they are frustrating and boring to use. Enemies are bullet sponges and have melee attack range a lot bigger than yours (not to mention that it's very hard to actually hit anything, which combined leads to very frustrating encounters). In the end the game does not work as an FPS - it's broken, frustrating and boring shooter. You can get it for the looks, but just don't get it for complete experience."

I cannot recommend it though due to the repetitve gameplay, the horrible optimization and the clunky combat. The weapons are odd and the movement is too slow for effective evading techniques. One gets the feeling that it is still in pre alpha stage.5.5/10 which is a thumb down."

,Recommended,537430,31830912,Posted: 18 May,all,megadave42,"Update #2: Finally beat the game. Took around 6 hours or so. I've replaced my original review scores with my final numbers (until the game is patched at which time I will update again).Gameplay 8/10I took a point off here for some noclip issues I noticed once in a while and some framerate problems between when I obtained my first gun and when I obtained my second gun. Overall I really enjoyed the gameplay though. The weapons are very unique compared to other shooters.Story 6/10I never really did figure out what was going on exactly. I found most of the letters/tablets but I'm still missing approximately three. However, it's still hard to work out exactly what the plaques on the wall say. If I could locate the letter ""S"" that would help a lot. For now, it's a guessing game and I'm not 100% sure what the story was even after beating it. This score could go higher once I find the other letters and can actually figure out what's going on.Graphics 9/10This may possibly be the best looking indie game I've ever played. I took a point off for some of the same reasons the gameplay got docked a point but man does this game look good. You could take an endless amount of beautiful screenshots from this game.Music/Sound 5/10The music that was there was good but it cut out occasionally or had missing sound effects once in a while. On top of that, the music that is there (although very good) is not varied. I feel the music is the weakest part of the game only because there is so little variation.Length 9/10The length of the game gets some bonus points because the game costs so little. The campaign is about the same length as Titanfall 2 or a COD game but the price is 1/3rd of what those games cost. I felt the length was perfect. And I could have added more time to my playthrough by trying to find more secrets/tablets.Price 10/10I paid right around $17 or $18 for this. You really can't beat that price for what you get in return. The price is just right for anyone to take a chance on this game.So we've got six scores above. Add them up, divide by six and the final review score is...7.83/10. Still a definite buy IMHO but if you are on the fence, definitely watch some gameplay. Most reviewers seemed to have more trouble with the game than I did so read up on those problems a little before buying.I'll post my specs below for comparison. My PC is NOT top-of-line or anything and I'm not having some of the other issues reported here but perhaps more info/specs can help narrow down some of the problems and where/why they are occuring.My specs:GTX 1060 6GB dual fani7-2600k (this processor is pretty old now)Corsair Vengeance Pro ram (12 GB)Regular old 500GB HDWin7 64 bit (that's right, still on Win7)I ran the game just fine on high settings with my PC but I even booted the game up on my Lenovo W541 laptop just to see how it would do and it ran pretty well after turning the settings on low."
76561197970687383,Recommended,537430,31831487,Posted: 18 May,all,A Nameless Ghoul,"EDIT:after the first(!) patch the game is running A LOT smoother for me. there are still occasions when  the frames will drop (for no apparent reason) but they were very rare and not as bad as initially. and just as well i did not have any game breaking bugs anymore. maybe i was lucky but having two of those within 90 minutes and now none in the remaining time i played, i would say they fixed a bunch of stuff.a few(!) more options were added (thank god for turning off motion blur) and there are noticably more sound effects now. all in all it just feels far more polished. don't get me wrong: it is still an indie game and you can tell by the mechanics and some gameplay decisions, but that adds to the charme of the game. and by the sheer look of it, you would not know that it's a such a small studio. i tip my hat.i left my original review below because most if it still is true, but considering the amount of work they obviously put into the game since release, their seemingly huge commitment to fixing all they can and their great way of dealing with the community i changed my rating to a thumbs up.for the money you pay you get an aweinspiringly great looking game that may be far from perfect but worth your time, if you ask me.here's the ORIGINAL review:never did i struggle so much to give a recommendation, or rather NOT give a recommendation.first off: i still somehow love the game and will keep it (even tho i'm still within the timeframe of asking for a refund) and will try to keep playing it. i'm sincerely hoping to get some fixes on the game. the devs just seem to be inexperienced and had to rush it for release. the vision and idea behind it are awesome and i honestly believe that the team can do better and maybe even prove to do so.but at the state, that the game currently is in right now, i sadly can not tell anyone to go and spend money on it.it's broken, badly optimized and obviously poorly playtested:Pros:· stunning visuals that feel very much like giger and beksinski had a vision they brought to digital live.· great atmosphere.· so far ok leveldesign.· decent music (even tho it's far too loud).Cons:· poor optimisation - framerates go unpredictably from 100-20 fps within seconds. [improved]· sad excuse of an options menu without any means of chaning keybinds nor anything beyond ""low"" or ""high"" graphics. [improved, still not great]· seemingly lack of soundeffects. [seems fixed]· gamebreaking bugs. [seem fixed as well]i had to restart a chapter twice because after loading a savegame i spawned without weapons so i could not solve a puzzle. another time a trigger to advance to the next section did just not work. and that's within less than two hours of gameplay. [not happend again so far]as i said: the idea and visuals, that caught my attention to the title will keep me playing but for nearly 20 bucks i can not recommend it to anyone. wait for patches or a sale."

The gameis GREAT! Really immersive at this res and full FOV. Good story line, Terrific,realistic graphics, do not know my fps, only that it runs very smooth with no hiccups with only a I7 4930k cpu and EVGA GTX 980ti s/c edition. Everything is maxed out and I turned out the lights for even more immersion. Scaaary...Only thing I noticed (no big deal), is the sound does not appear to be Dolby surround-that would really be awesome.  Also, the mouse speed, is too fast, had to drop my DPI settings in my mouse to the lowest (200 dpi) and it still accelerates rather quickly. No sensitivity setting for mouse. But I;m sure whatever bugs are there, and improvements to be made, wi;; come with future patches. The devs have come a long way since origina; release and are still working on more developments.It would be great if once all patches are done, DLC's would be available for purchase to keep this great game going. I was very leary and hesitant to purchase, but now I'm very glad I did. Highly recommend this game to anyone who likes this type.  If you have an Ultrawide monitor with the hardware to support the graphics, you are in for a treat!Thanks devs for your hard work and follow through with the patches."

I've seen better graphics, but this game is visually very enjoyable by any standards. That's all postive I have to say about Inner Chains.After 89 minutes into the game:There's almost no exposition story-wise.Game stutters all the time.Game design, atmosphere and sound design are not found.Feels like some advanced benchmark or game prototype at best.Walking simulator in this setting would be much more enjoyable, I guess. Since fighting and exploreing has nothing interresting to offer.Extreme boredom."

The only positive element of this game appears to be the static assets that are made and implemented quite neatly in Unreal engine, but there are too few of them and they're recycled over and over again. Collisions, mechanics, level design, hit boxes, sound design are awful and outdated. No idea what's going on in this game, the setting seems random and the world is random and not coherent. Frustrating controls and very limited interaction makes playing this a chore. Not Recommended unless you want to apraciate some elements of graphic design that some may find interesting although too heavily inspired by biomechanics standards. to put a number on it, let's be generous and say 4/10"

Everything else about the game  though...simply put was a total♥♥♥♥♥♥show. Game shouldn't have been released in the state it was in.  This company however shows promise and the ability to make great games. They just need to work on polishing their games better down the line.

,Recommended,537430,31827915,Posted: 18 May,all,Megastruktur,"Okay, when I first saw the trailer I said: ""Wow! That's the game I definitely wanna play!"" and added it to wishlist.Today the email came that I can buy it now. Without any doubt I pressed the button and...... and saw the very pretty atmosphere of dark horror and apocalypse. But have some complainements:Head bobbing without any setting to turn it off. GOD it makes me sick. I couldn't play more than about 45 mins and even then I had to take a short rest.No keyboard settings. C'mon, guys, it's 21th century (and not a post-apocalypse!  :D ). I need my mouse and keyboard tuned!Intro is toooooo long (just walking and walking). Maybe that is just inside my head (bobbing really made me cry).Could you just add a scroll (from the corpse of a soldier with world-danger descriptions) somewhere at the beginning? Or maybe even give the main character this scroll from the very beginning, but make it empty and when encounter (or read from the wall/learned from other characters) it is filled with info and graphics?Will it be an open-world like Dark Souls? I think it would be great if so. But anyway I want to see, what's inside  :)I've been waiting for that game but can't play untill that ""head bobbing"" exists. Will wait the patch or refund it in a week...UPDATE: the head bobbing setting is added, now the game is playable. And I'm enjoing it's biomechanical world of inner horrors  :)  So basically, atmosphere and lack of tutorials make the game interesting.  :)"
,Recommended,537430,31826017,Posted: 18 May,all,The Real Tim Shady,"I will post a pro/con TL:DR list at the end. Please x4 read the entire review if you have time.EDIT 6/24/2017: I originally wrote a negative review of this game, although I have changed it to a positive one after the latest patch two or so days prior to writing this review. This is both a review for the consumers and critique for the new devs.Firstly, what have I always liked about this game, even before the patch? The visuals as you can see are quite stunning. I have a dozen or so screenshots to prove its fidelity. I found the lava particularly interesting... having its own 3D mesh and animations. Lava-waterfalls are unrealistic but neat nonetheless. Seeing lava drip and droop from a hanging rock would be more realistic and pleasing in its own right :DApart from gushing about lava... the soundtrack is masterful, though VERY limited. It's so nice yet there's only two or so scores: combat and exploration. The game's premise is engaging as well. A crazy religious cult, albeit one very different than the one found in Outlast 2. It's a shame though, with such a nice world there is not much world-building. Sure there are word walls to find, but you need to learn the cult's alphabet first, which requires a playthrough in itself. I would feel more inclined to do a 2nd playthrough if this knowledge also led to new areas, and if I had already gotten a taste of the world's lore through a couple notes already in english.It is a shame this game will be plagued with possibly inaccurate review statistics, containing many reviews with now false information. However, the devs have some blame in this as well... Many people, including myself, were upset about a number of things not included in the game. These are now INCLUDED IN THE LATEST PATCH-21:9 support. Not flawless, though better than majority of indie games and many triple A titles-FOV slider. The highest FOV allowed in the menu was enough for me, though picky consumers might want more. At least they have it now!-Disable Head-bobbing: Sorry Telepaths Tree, the headbobbing was atrociously nauseating, coming from someone who has never really experienced motion sickness in games prior. Always keep the option to disable head bob, although I welcome a MILD amount of headbob for immersion.-Mouse sensitivity and re-binding keys are still disabled as far as I know. Default control configuration is simple, standard, and fits our needs just fine. Devs, let me know when this has changed and I will modify this information so my review remains accurate.I have earned respect for the devs. In the face of mostly negative reviews, they listened to our ♥♥♥♥♥ing and complaining, implementing all these above features. Although they should have debatably been in the game to start, finding developers who listen and fix several issues within about a month are rare gems to find indeed. I do hope they profit from this game and continue creating games and improving their standards.There is so much more I could go over, however I will leave the rest of the review with my TL:DR list, including some details I have yet to mention.~~~~~~TL:DR~~~~~~+Great for a relaxed gaming session with some action+Stunning visuals. Feel free to check my n00b screenshots+Friendly devs who listen to their consumers and issue patches in a timely manner.+Engaging premise+Very creative weapon designs (I love the animations on the 3rd gun)+Great, but not flawless, 21:9 support+Nice music (sadly, only two or so tracks, getting repetitive)+Creative gunplay game mechanics. Use your own life force when you run out of resources :o+Short and sweet game-length+Guidance to objectives are relatively subtle and immersive+BEST LAVA EVER+Improved sound design (still could use more work, yet few games can compell me to look in a certain direction because I hear something)-Poor launch: missing features (now fixed with latest patch)-Little reason for multiple playthroughs. Lore is hidden behind an alphabet you translate throughout the game ONLY if you explore well enough-Head-bob is absurdly nauseating, BUT can be disabled.-Odd voice acting. Perhaps post processing to make voice marginally more gritty and deep like the NPC preachers would mend this.-Performance improved but still not satisfactory. Frequent stutters, frame drops, and the like. That said, my gtx 1070 at 3440x1440 highest settings can run 50+ fps under most circumstances.Telepath's Tree; if you would like a full-fledged critique then by all means contact me. I am no game developer or professional reviewer by any means, though I certainly have more things to say, both positive and negative."

76561198048312377,Recommended,537430,31858112,Posted: 20 May,all,TwitchTV_Vantazzy,"UPDATED : 11/09/2017Good Points:- Great Artwork throughout the entire game- Nice concept in ""learning"" the alien language- Great animations- Interesting Story- Awesome Intro Movie- Mouse is locked inside of the game- You can JUMP!!!!!Bad Points:- You have very low stamina- Lag, Lag, Lag, Lag, Lag, Lag - at least for me this game was one big lag fest- Sound screwups (at least in Chapter 4)- Stupid AI (getting stuck, not paying attention, clipping through walls)- Confusing maps (luckily there are those flowers that show you the way)- Broken areas (there was an area where a door needed to be open but it closed because I killed an enemy in front of it while I should have waited till it was further away from the door, had to restart that bit a few times and more of these types of events)- The endboss, I havent finished that one because of time pressure, but when I arrived, I already knew the entire room was broken, nothing concrete was happening and it looked rediculous... Like you got this whole story build up and anticipation of an awesome and scary sorceress but reality in this game was dissappointing. Will finish it next time I play it though.- Repetitive situations (eventually you have seen it already, I wanted to see something new, something special but that never happened, like the art is nice but it repeats endlessly throughout the game... pffff....) And the enemies... Deadly surroundings... Always that, no more variation... :(- Puzzles (only found one actually, was quite nice, use your surroundings to solve it, put more of those in the game and the game would be so much better in content - What do I mean? Well, opening doors, some face controls open and close doors simultaneously, have more of those in the game, makes it a larger game sure, but gives more content)- Collectables? When you can collect things, finding secrets, makes a game so much more. Sadly the only ""secrets"" this game has are the hidden letters for understanding the language.Verdict:Even though this game has it's flaws, bugs, glitches, all is forgiven because of it's atmosphere, the artwork and overall surroundings. You really feel like you are somewhere else. Confused, alone and even more confused. Now that I know the story a tiny bit, it is still confusing. Maybe when I kill the endboss, everything will be cleared out? Who knows, well I do, in a matter of time.And because the lag is not towards everybody, it is graphics card depended I guess, you can have a fluid transition through the game with responsive controls. I recommend this game, just for it's artwork and atmosphere. Couldn't really enjoy the game in the fullest, because when an enemy surrounds me, the entire game lags the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me and I die EVERYTIME!Maybe that's why I've spend so many hours already in the game, just because of the endless deaths I had to witness because of the lag. Like when I look in front of me, everything is fine, but when I look around myself, LAG LAG LAG!!! Close quaters, like walking in small rooms, the game suddenly has no lag.Luckily I have a lot of patience and tried to enjoy it while it lasted and I have to say: I enjoyed it.Now for the content overall, I would recommend to sell this game with a pricetag of 4,99 till 8,99... Never lower, just because you pay way more for an exposition in a museum to see beautiful alien art. :-)Game Engine 7/10Artwork 10/10Gameplay 8/10 (with lag 3/10)Content 5/10Expectations versus Satisfaction 4/10Duration 6/10Value 6/10"
