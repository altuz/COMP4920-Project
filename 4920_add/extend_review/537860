76561197969919209,Not Recommended,537860,25995494,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,PolyhedRON SWANSON,"This feels like someone's first attempt at a flash game at Newgrounds, and they thought, ""Hey maybe I could sell this for money"" then proceeded to sell the game without play testing it.Why would I say such a thing?1)  Sound designWhile one could label the sound design as a ""throwback"" motif, instead, it just feels lazy.  First of all, in the options menu, an accidental click sent the sound bar in the options menu (the volume control bar) WAY off the screen.  It's like there was no thought process about how users might interact with options.Secondly, the sounds themselves get old VERY quickly.  Not like ""an hour or two"" quickly.  I'm talking about a matter of waves in the first level.  And the music is just BAD.2)  GameplayThe game has several, VERY OBVIOUS design flaws.The first: There isn't any balance to the towers.  Generally, towers are meant to be geared towards certain types of mobs.  Faster firing towers handle faster moving mobs, and vice versa.  However, in this game, there is a breed of zombie that moves faster than most projectiles, so most towers end up missing.  Even towers you'd expect with an instaneous hit, like snipers or teslas or simple ""gun"" turrets, miss, and miss often.  This results in an incredibly frustrating experimentation with towers, only to find that they're all gonna miss.  Thus, the fast creeps are likely to ruin your life early.Secondly, there isn't even a modicum of a story line, there's nothing to explain the how or why, and there's nothing to keep me interested in the game.  It's a very simple, overly so, map with mission markers.  There isn't any sort of ""after action report"" or anything to let you know the results of your game, or any reason to come back and try a harder difficulty.  There's no reason at all.Third, I accidently clicked new game instead of continue, and it erased my previous game.  Just as simple as that.  With no ability to retrieve it.  Incredibly bad design.3)  Application designEvery time I boot this game, I have to start it first, alt tab out of a black screen, kill it with task manager, and start it again before it will properly boot.  What's more, I get this weird second process under the same name popping up in task manager sometimes.  I don't know what to say, other than, ""Why is this happening?""Now, I've played some tower defense games in my time, old school and modern.  You can't cover up bad game design with an ""Old School"" moniker.  They are not synonomous.  Avoid this game, even for 50 cents.  I'll let the developer keep my money as a punishment to myself for buying it without seeing a proper review."

I bought it really cheap(~$0.25)so its worth that, i guess.This product looks like someone's first attempt to make a game, and this person did it. Its is a game, we can play, but there is no ""soul"" in it. Oldschool games were hard but crazy and interesting. This one is hard and boring and you might even think ""Duuuh, why am I spending my time on this... ah, cards, right""Once I hit F12 to make a screenshot, I had chrome developer console popout, so i ask myself Wuut?Meh/10"

Figured it would be worth that much because I like simple tower defense games.The reviews, apparently, were very positive, but when I searched for them manually later, most of them were negative.But this piece of crap doesn't even work half of the time. The game runs, don't get me wrong, but the towers don't shoot properly while in range of the enemies. And when they do, they do so unreliably. The faster you set your game speed, the more accurate they become, but getting the core basics of a game wrong (i.e. shooting stuff) is a no-no for me.  Your little nephew (age 8) could probably make a better game.2/10TL:DR got fooled by Steam review manipulation; this is a sh!t game."
,Not Recommended,537860,26591918,"Posted: 13 November, 2016",all,kumori,"After 100% achievments: This game is as bad as it is ugly. Bugs, broken mechanics and poor balance. I spent so much time with it because the ""New Game"" is just next to ""Continue"" and will wipe your game progress without asking first.It starts up as nwjs.exe (meaning northwind.js). So quite literally a javascript browser game running in a browser environment. (NwJS runs javascript using chromes javascript engine.) Another more obvious hint is that if you load your game instead of starting a new one, the score will constantly say NaN (which means ""Not a Number"" in javascript world). That is a programmer goof if I ever saw one. And yet the dev pushes it live and sells the game for money? Classy. I'm sure there can be good games made with purely javascript, but this is not it.The napalm tower has a bullet that explodes on impact and does AoE damage. The  thing is that when it detonates it also triggers all other bullets of the same type to detonate. Meaning if you have one of those towers close to the path, and another far from the path. The tower far from the path will never hit anything as long as the first tower is firing. And the game is riddled with this kind of broken silliness. You are fighting the game breaking bugs and not the monsters.Still, the napalm tower is the only viable tower... wait for it...In all the 10 levels! Great balancing there!I could rage on this for days, but I'll keep it short to save my soul: Don't get this game. Not for cheap, not for free."
,Not Recommended,537860,26409621,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,Apoc,"The first 5 levels are fun... Then you end up on Level 6 and you find out the only way to win against the new enemy type is placing napalm towers at the exact right spots. You repeat this for the last 4 levels and you are done.Difficulty level does not seems to matter much and beating the game on a harder difficulty does not seems to change anything.There is also a score but it is glitched and always say NaN.There are really costly towers but you can't really afford them while upgrading your Napalm army and the weaker towers don't really do anything past the first levels.Some towers actually shot projectiles and those can miss depending on placement and enemy speed, it's interesting but also infuriating since you can't really guess before placing them.I could not really understand the target priority, sometimes a tower will let an almost dead enemy pass and attack some other farther back without a second though.You also can't switch target priority, the only options are upgrading or selling a tower and upgrading simply boost the stats, no special bonus for tower types.In game there is a sound button but it does not do anything, you have to exit to the main menu to go in the options.It is a really short game in need of a lot of balancing, 75% of my playtime was spent on level 6.In its current state I can't recommend it, at least it is cheap."

The music and sound sliders are broken. They do lower the sound and music but can be extended outside of the normal area. This is a cheap game made cheaply.

Honestly, if I had to guess, I'd say some kid did this as a high school project, his dad figured they could make a few bucks, and so they posted it to steam.  There is only 1 way to beat this game, and you can only beat it on east.  Very broken and not worth even 99 cents."

Anyway I enjoyed playing it because I managed to finish all 10 levels in less than one hour. I cheated, of course. But hell, who would play this regularyly?There are a few things I really liked about this game, because they made me laugh:- There is an anti aircraft gun, but there are no aircrafts. At least I did not notice any, but maybe I overlooked them. Still this gun works fine against all other enemies.- Guns simply miss their targets. This is really innovative, I have never seen this on a tower defense game.- The graphics are said to be 'old style'. This redefines 'old'. I thought C64 was old, but obviously I was wrong.Compared to Android games, that can give you good value for 59 Cents, this one falls apart. But still I recommend buying it. I am serious. First (as stated) it is funny how ugly a game can be. Secondly, as long as you buy it in a special offer (like I did) this is the cheapest way of saving 40 Cents.And finally: No matter if you cheat or not: This is a tower defense game. So you can have at least a little fun with it.Go for it, just to support the silly fun!"

In this game, you have to find the right combination for the tower to defeat/kill/destroy the enemy (robot most of it). You have to find the right combination of tower to save or increase your money so that you can build/upgrade better weapon. Yes it has not the best graphic, but i rather have more difficult level and try how to beat that game rather that beautiful graphic but easy game and you just spend 1 hour or two to finish the game."

I have only one complaint, it seems that when one shot from the 800 credit fire cannons goes off all shots from that cannon type also go off wherever they are at. For a while it looked like the shells were hitting a n invisable wall, but when i started putting only one of this gun type it happened less.AMAZING VALUE.

76561197998886660,Not Recommended,537860,32388842,Posted: 13 June,all,Bellzebub,This game has some great potential but is let down by some major issues.Pro :Clean graphics with good and intuitive interface.Lots of tower options.casual (quick) games.Con :When restarting your have the option to continue or new and too many times i have hit new by mistake and had to restart the entire game again from level 1.  Very frustrating.Game seems to rely a lot on luck as the towers do not always hit.  I keep getting what appears to be misfires (explosions at the towers) and clear misses.  I have seen my towers too many times shoot down a line of enemy to go off the screen without a hit and multitude of shots on a single enemy from multiple towers that all miss.  This happens far too often and makes the game reliant on luck as opposed to strategy or tactics.  This essentially becomes a deal breaker for me as the point of tower defense games is strategy and tactics to defend the base.
