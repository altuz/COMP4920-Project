However I think the story-line may be confusing for people who haven't played the other short games before this one. I highly recommend playing them, not only will you understand this game more but they're also really good, free little games :) Here's the link to the series on GameJolt>http://gamejolt.com/games/bad-dream-series/20494"

I adore the style of the game, simple point 'n click game, simple art style, but still so much to it. It's very easy to replay the game, just to try to get a different ending or change the way the story goes. Yes, this is actually a game where your actions have consequences, and even the smallest thing'like killing birds'can change the story.- Good story- Looking nice and creepy- Lots of variation- Challenging puzzles-Frustrating achievements!I can only recommend this, especially if you like gore and point 'n click games.And hey, watch out for the bird monster, he will punish you if you are a 'bird hater'"

The soundtrack  is amazingly eerie. The puzzles are simple enough that anybody could understand them, but well designed enough that they are still challenging.If this review still doesn't convince you, I urge you to search for the other games in the Bad Dream series. As they are completely free and whilst they are nothing in comparison to this fully polshed counterpart, they will give you a nice feel for the game and the lore.Or You could check out videos on the bad dream series on YouTube, There are many great YouTubers with videos of this game available. (Gameplay videos will obviously contain spoilers)Edit: Removed YouTube Channel to avoid confusion :)"

The combination of the creepy and atmospheric music, with beautiful yet simple art, sprinkled with intriguing story and challanging gameplay made for a very positive experience. Although the game was not as scary as I had liked I can still guarantee that if you're a fan of point and clicks and puzzles you'll have a blast playing this game! Initially I bought it because I thought it'd be great youtube bait but before I knew it 3 hours had passed!The story is while simple, well developed, the characters are unique and quirky and the puzzles challenging! and the refrences to previous games made it feel all the more well polished! I feel desert fox has done a fantastic job and look forward to any more content they may have up their sleeve!"
,Recommended,538070,30499138,Posted: 13 March,all,Horseless Headless Flyguy,"In Bad Dream: Coma, you are just another traveler exploring your own dreams. You can interact with the world as much as you want, however one wrong decision could doom you and everyone else in the storyline. The game requires you to make a ton of choices, each one having a significant impact on how the game plays out.The game was a very immersive experience for me. I loved being able to play in the universe that Desert Fox previously created in the other games of the Bad Dream series. For returning fans of the point-and-click series, you'll find a lot of references to the previous games, including even miniscule details from the original games. Aside from the references, I found it interesting to explore the new chapters of the series and finding out what each choice does. I learned early on that killing too many crows leads to a bad turn of events down the road. The gameplay changes with each choice as well, which i found interesting. For a more ""horrifying"" experience, you can continue doing destructive acts, or for a more lighthearted tone, you can continue doing good actions. All of the gameplay and story is delivered through the same illustrated art style that was used in the previous games, which was a huge plus to the overall experience.I rate this game with a 9/10.I'd definitely recommend it to fans of horror and point-and-clicks alike."
,Recommended,538070,30423617,Posted: 10 March,all,Skybii,"Wonderful game, could not put it down until I had gotten one of the endings. Absolutely can't wait to play it again and try to figure out how to get the other two and see how they affect things. Your typical point and click gameplay with wonderfully stylized visuals, chilling and atmospheric music/sounds, it's wonderful. If you've played the somewhat disjointed Bad Dream series of free games you'll be wonderfully surprised as this ties everything together into a fairly clear cut and heartbreaking narrative while being very disturbing and unsettling at the same time. It really does feel like a bad dream! If you're into this kind of game it's definitely worth a playthrough or two, and if you're not, I'd reccomend watching one just to experience this wonderful thing."
,Recommended,538070,30568202,Posted: 17 March,all,hurtybitey,"This game is amazing! It is easy to tell a lot of effort went in to it. The puzzles are challenging in the sense that it made my mindset shift perspective to solve them sometimes. I think that's pretty freaking cool. I also like the atmosphere the music created. It kept me on my toes. If you are on the fence about whether or not to get this game, I say get it. It is worth it. It's not expensive and due to all the different endings you can get hours upon hours of gameplay out of it. This, however, is only my opinion."
,Recommended,538070,30544985,Posted: 16 March,all,marcie,"First off I have to thank Desert Fox for making another wonderful game! The community has been amazing and through this game I've made tons of wonderful friends. ♥I got this game on sale, skeptical because of how simple it seemed. Before I had seen Youtubers play the other games in the series, but I'm so glad I bought and played this one for myself.From what I'm told this is the finale of the series, or at least very close to, and Desert Fox put a lot of attention and detail into their game. The design, while unpretentious, is actually very flattering to the gameplay. I can assure you there is numerous hours of replay value, because of the multiple endings and secrets worth unlocking--and every ending has a twist that will leave you searching for answers. Thankfully, Desert Fox doesn't leave you wanting, and they do answer all of your questions in the game.It's a very satisfying game, to put it short. After putting together the puzzle and solving the mystery, I'm sure you'll feel very satisfied. Bad Dream: Coma is a game to make the player feel accomplished. I have never played a point-and-click that has stuck with me, but this one, without a doubt, will forever be one of my favorite games."

,Recommended,538070,30536134,Posted: 15 March,all,Whiteout,"Bad Dream: Coma is a point and click adventure game with macabre elements to it.  You find yourself in a dream in which you sustain life-threatening injuries, such as getting the top of your head chopped clean off, but you won't ever die.  You'll just keep living with part of your brain missing and stumble about the world with severely impaired function and what remains of your brain dripping out of your sliced skull quite frequently.  Obviously, you want to find a way to stop that.In order to find a way to bring back the ability for anybody to die, you have to go through many chapters of the game and interact with the environment.  You can pick up items that are found throughout the chapters and then use these items to advance through the chapters, such as unlocking doors with keys or making enemies go away by feeding them slabs of meat.  For the most part, the game does a pretty good job at that part.  Most of the puzzles do make sense and there is a feeling of accomplishment and ephiphany when you make a connection.  There are a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t puzzles in my opinion with how you need to ""draw"" in a new part of the level with a pen at one point when the concept was never shown before or even hinted at, as well as times where I everything was so vague that I had to click on everything with all of my items to get a reaction, but they didn't sour the entire experience.  It just halted progression for a good twenty minutes until I finally found a solution.In all, I'd recommend the game to anyone who doesn't mind some minor body horror and slight gore.  It has great replayability thanks to different ways you can solve puzzles, even if it's going to take you a while to figure out how to get all those endings."

It's not relaxing, but gives you real emotions instead. It's not easy, all these riddles gave me a headache. You can play this game for hours and hours and you'll never get bored.The first ending leaves you unsatisfied and you want to play again. Caution: it's addicting!"

Great puzzles, though I admit some puzzles are really just random that your best bet would be to click/interact with just about everything in the vicinity. I like the twisted ideas/story on each of the chapters, definitely lives up to the Bad Dream Series before this. Environmental sounds/noises are there and do add to the game.Overall, if you want a spooky/puzzle experience then look no further than this mother****ing game right here."

The puzzles are lame and boring!  Some are pixel hunt/hidden object puzzles.  Some are just frustrating. You'll be clicking the screen all over in frustation at times.You'll backtrack back and forth from screen to screen until you find what you need to pass the puzzles.

But based off of those 2 chapters, I can say for a fact that this game has got me hooked. I love it. The developers did a perfect job of creating a game where you have to explore around everywhere and experiment with stuff to get different results from the game, but the real cream of the crop is the eerie feeling that the game gives you. It either leaves you feeling spooked or makes you jump at what you just did (not going to give an example to avoid spoiling anything. I did a let's play of this game.

,Recommended,538070,34557604,Posted: 28 August,all,Witch-Hunt,"Nice game, but I was left with an impression that it ""tries too hard"".Getting too elaborate and detailed, when sometimes it would be better to keep it simple.I am a big fan of ""Bad Dream"" games series, the ones that preceded this and of course was hyped for this game. And those gave more of a sense of solitude and ""coma"", actually. Probably due to being minimalistic in everything: art, ambience, soundtrack.For example, the ""memories"" episode.The presence of Death off screen felt more creepy, rather than when you meet her in person.And the kid's doodles, like, just what kid would draw his dead dog in such a grotesque way? Small game ""memories"" conveyed the emotions stronger.I also miss the appearring dead birds on the bridge from the demo. The feeling of creeping doom was stronger, making it closer to the original small games.I think ""Coma"" is too strong for the title, it's more about a nightmare though. Specially when seeing you character falling asleep like ordinary.Non the less, it's a good game on it's own, with an interesting concept of changing the world depending on your decisions to several endings."
76561197972442783,Recommended,538070,33328255,Posted: 6 July,all,Skarhead,"I wish there was a ""meh"" rating.   To me this falls into that category.  It's not bad, but not good either.  It's a typical point-and-click adventure, except there are: good, neutral and bad ratings to your actions.  The hand drawn characters and backgrounds are pretty cool.  The ""less is more"" approach works here with the art work.Honestly it didn't make much sense to me.  I've played about an hour and a half and just called it quits.  Since nothing made any sense, I felt no attachment to the story (if you can call it that).  So, to me it's a ""meh,"" if it's on sale and you like point-and-click pick it up."

,Not Recommended,538070,30817049,Posted: 29 March,all,The LOVES Series,"I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. It is one of the most non-sensical, random games I've ever played. It does do a few things well, like ambient sounds and general creepiness. Other than that, this game is AWFUL.First of all, there is no coherent story whatsoever. Random characters will appear just for the sake of appearing. Some take part in what you have to do and others just appear and disappear with no rhyme or reason at all. The dialogue is super random and doesn't make sense. Half of it is broken English. Characters say things to you that have no bearing on anything whatosever. It just doesn't make sense!!Secondly, the puzzles are awful. The game throws you into each level/chapter with no hints or guidance as to what to do or where to go. Therefore, you'll find yourself just clicking all over the screens picking up random items until eventually one or more may make sense. Some items are made obvious that you'd have to pick them up or interact with them. Others are completely incognito and you won't know until you randomly click on them. Another crappy thing is that the game's items work in a specific order for puzzles. So even if you see something that will obviously be used in the level, you may not be able to pick it up until five other things occur first.One particular segment of a puzzle REALLY♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off because it required to manipulate what had only been up to that point the game's graphics. I went through multiple chapters and not once did I have to add on to a level by drawing more of a level, and yet at this specific point, the dev thought it would be a good idea to add that as a feature. More non-sensical garbage with zero guidance.While the creepiness and sound are pretty nice, everything else about this game is pretty awful. Puzzles aren't hard, but they're stupid and random. Don't expect a story that makes sense at all either.All in all, I would steer clear of this game for sure. It's NOT worth any of your time!"
,Not Recommended,538070,30423606,Posted: 10 March,all,MirvannaScythes,"Welp. That was anticlimatic. I can't say much more without spoilers, but I felt the 'good' ending was a little lack luster with open ends.I mean, what happened to death? Is he gone for good? Is the dog dead? Are the parents dead? Did any of this happen? Was any of it inspired by trauma of a real incident for the PC? Going to run through the bad route now, but it felt like a great game then... crash ""Grats, you woke up! It was all a dream bro""."
76561198312514234,Recommended,538070,30462663,Posted: 11 March,all,prometheusmails,"Overall the game had a creepy vibe throughout. Also it was pretty visceral while staying like cartoon, pretty much what a bad dream would feel like. There seems to be so much to explore and many ways to go about progressing in the game. There may also be a few secrets or optional items in the game, though I have just started so I am not entirely sure yet. In the end it is a really fun game and something feels slightly off for an excellent atmospheric thriller. Can't wait to play more of this."

However, one can play through the game as either Bad or Neutral or Good and the puzzles and conversation will vary - not a whole lot, but somewhat, with each. I started with Bad because once you're 'bad' you will stay so the whole game, but as 'good' one can occasionally do something to move down to 'neutral.' So make sure you check on this before you end a chapter, or you will be stuck with it.)Be warned though, this is not a game to play if one is feeling rushed or impatient, as ones enjoyment may be compromised.I am a person that likes (needs?) to buy games on sale, but found this one worth the price."
