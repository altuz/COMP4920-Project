76561198051085778,Not Recommended,538810,30718783,Posted: 24 March,all,Ronald Reagan,"UPDATED as of 4-4-17, all updates are installed. Some issues are fixed but others still stand. I still do not reccommend this game. Part names are still mostly wrong (and often nowhere close to right) and part disasembly and reassembly order inconsistencies persist.I hate to say this but do not buy this game. Not yet at least. It is not worth $15 (or even its $10 sale price) in its current state. I would hesitate to even pay $5 right now. There are a number of issues. Hopefully these are release bugs that will be quickly fixed.(Possibly fixed, haven't tested) First off, on some jobs, the crane will move on its own and not stop moving. I tried restarting the mission and even the game but it did not fix the problem. I was only able to get past the job by luck of the crane lining up by chance.(UPDATED) The fuse problem is fixed.(UPDATED, somewhat fixed, explained below) Third, and this is more of a realism issue, the diesel locomotives have spark plugs... This seriously put me off. Those that are mechanically inclined will realize that diesel engines DO NOT have spark plugs. Gas engines do and these obviously are not gas engines, they are diesel.Update to spark plugs.... They are now glow plugs. Okay, that's better. However, these locomtive engines don't have glow plugs either. Besides that, glowplugs don't have springs and are not driven by a rocker arm from the camshaft. On top of that, the glowplugs in the game are actually where the fuel injectors should be. This isn't nagging about not enough realism, this is just trying to fix what is already in the game.(UPDATED) The game remembering settings is fixed. There still isn't a setting for mouse sensitivity though. C'mon devs... The mouse sensitivty is rediculous right now.(UPDATED) The repair of rear leaf springs has been fixed.It would also be nice to see more bolts in parts. It feels like almost everything is click to remove and very few parts have any bolts that you have to actually use the wrench on. (Somewhat improved in the latest update now but still not great).(UPDATED) Also, completing all 25 jobs at the steam depot automatically completes all 25 jobs at all other depots as well. I had only done the first 12 at both the diesel and electric depots. After completing the last steam job and the credits rolled, everything was completed everywhere.I am a train fanatic and I love the concept of the game, working on trains, but I find it hard to love the game when it has these issues. And it's only taken an hour of gameplay to find them. Devs, please work out these bugs. I can put up with other minor issues and nuisances I've come across but seriously, make a game worth buying. This one isn't right now. I will improve my review if these issues are fixed."
,Recommended,538810,30692908,Posted: 23 March,all,The Space Wolf,So far I'm enjoying this game. There are a few things I would like to see as in more parts in the diesel locomotive and parts on the outside of the locomotive being able to be damaged and replaced. I would like to see a more realistic driver mode. Overall its car mechanic simulator but with trains.
,Not Recommended,538810,30773902,Posted: 27 March,all,Staalby,"Way too rushed. Not ready for release if you ask me.Bear in mind that this is not the same team behind Car Mechanic Simulator.This game is lacking very much in content and gets repetitive very fast. Also riddled with bugs and screw-ups.Such as 30% of the fuses only being fixable on an mechanical workbench, even though there is an electronic workbench.This is apparently fixed now. Lets see if they can keep it going.Most of the parts you never get to fix or even use, as they seem to be there only for looks and to make that 1000 parts brag. Ironically the relevant parts are omitted from all the trains. Talking about bearings and stuff. The essential details we are used to here in 2017.There areONLY3 trains. They might look different. But they are the same inside.The diesel locomotive doesnt even have a generator or a starter. It's hard to ignore, they have never seen a train from the inside.The steam locomotive is not a puzzle. It comes apart in big chunks, no chance to see how it works.The electric locomotive has many many parts, sadly you only ever get to fix 20% of them, rest is for showing off in the trailers.And don't get me started on driving the train.. Just don't.It would seem like they started making TMS2017 back in 2014. Got 40% done and rushed the release so it could get on the wagon with TSW:CSX Heavy Haul.If you come from Train Simulator, you will be very dissapointed.3/10As of my understanding and the lack of updates and communication.Abandoned"
,Recommended,538810,32048698,Posted: 29 May,all,(SVK)TheProzac,"I was waiting for this game for a while. Being a fan of trains and car mechanic simulator I knew what to expect and I got just that.So what can you expect? Let me add pros and cons first.Pros -You get a neat playground which is technically a miniature railway you can drive along.If you like lomotives you can strip them down in a relatively good detail but not too detailed to bore you to death.You get some crane action in case you get a derailed locomotive.Animations and loading screens are done neatlyCons -Some people may find the details too in depth or too shallow, for example I miss bodywork (but you cannot satisfy everyone)The physics in the miniature railway are... a bit off. You can never derail.Gameplay gets a bit repetitive after a while.And I miss some diagnostic tools like in Car Mechanic Simulator.Before I get too much in depth what you do in the game is basically this:In some cases you need to rescue an engine somewhere on your map sometimes with craneYou get it do depot, remove all damaged parts, attempt to repair them if it fails buy new ones and put them back in.You can also improve your workbenches which gives you a better chance of repair.I mentioned level of detail that is given to locomotives. As for me I unlocked all three depots so I have seen Diesel, Electric and Steam.I will take a good example of a diesel engine that is the first you are working on. You replace entire modules for example fuel tanks, but in some cases go to pretty nice details for example the engine is detailed down to pistons level.Electric engine is the same you can tear down the engine to individual components, replace single fire extinguisher bottles even switches and fuses in the engine room but hydraulic assemblies are huge boxes with 1 or 2 hoses.For the price they are asking it is an adequate game. Great if you want to pass some time doing something where you don´t need to think too hard once you learn the game mechanics. Graphics are pretty neat.I actually wonder when can I expect an airplane mechanic simulator from this company.PS: Dear developers if you are reading this there are some pretty exciting machines on rail constructions not just locomotives. I would suggest a DLC with something like Plasser and Theurer equipement for rail construction, another fine DLC may be TGV units and number three there are also railcars and carriages."
,Not Recommended,538810,32762493,Posted: 25 June,all,N◌oodles~,"The train mechanic sim, that thought it was car mechanic- but worse.If you've ever played a car mechanic game (any year), then you'll know that you need money to upgrade your workshop and buy parts - well the same applies to this game and it's routine of buying parts, fixing the car, rinise and repeat.The only difference with this game is that you buy the parts, drive to 'find' the broken train or 'rescue' it from a ditch, fix the train, rinse and repeat.All the following dislikes ruined this game -The lack of details on the actual trains, including limited fixable train parts are minimal or parts that would normally be on a train - non-existent.This game is too easy and feels like a grind-fest.The whole 'driving' to fetch another train is rubbish - no details, driving is too simple, uses sounds from Microsoft train sim, no realistic physics i.e. can't derail and the train goes faster than it actually is going.The use of the crane to 'pickup' another derailed train makes no sense - you can pick up a whole loco, with 1 (one) small rerailer crane; where as real life it'd take 2 or 3 cranes to.The actual body-work does not involve any repairs or fixes.You can only work on 1 train at a time, compared to car mechanic with 3.The whole 'open world' is a lie and so is the pictures on the store page, you're stuck to rails, so you can't explore where you go - however, you can choose which limited way to get around the map.On the topic of 'the map' it oftens glitches out to the point where you can't click the switch switches to change which way you're going with your mouse, forcing you to stop the train, press esc, restart the train and trying to reclick it again.You can not change the switches with the map alone.I can not recommend this game, it feels rushed, unfinished, broken, unrealistic and just does not feel right compared to other train 'sim' games.3/10 stars"

76561198111280264,Not Recommended,538810,30841529,Posted: 30 March,all,composerman04,I felt the controls to look around were very hard to use. It was very hard to maneuver the camera in a way you could find what you were looking for in some cases.
76561198001116296,Not Recommended,538810,30698112,Posted: 23 March,all,Ort,"It's fun, but I'm not sure I'll stick with it for long. It does some things better than CMS2015 and some things worse, and I think the ""worse"" will kill the long term playability. Fortunately it's relatively cheap, and hopefully there will be some patches and/or DLC to make improvements.Loading screens are drastically reduced compared to CMS2015, but instead there are a number of unskippable popups and time delays eat up a few seconds repeatedly. For example when you repair a part, it takes a couple seconds to repair and then a couple more to tell you success vs failure. When you finish a job, it takes a few seconds to tell you how much money you made. Compare that to CMS2015, where you can repair parts and finish jobs extremely quickly. It's not too bad, but I suspect that after a few hours of gameplay that's going to be very annoying.One thing I'm noticing is that it seems to be a bit light on advancement and customization. You can upgrade your repair stations and screw gun, but that's it. There are no additional diagnostic tools you can buy, or additional repair types you can research (ex: body work, paint, etc).In CMS2015, you could also customize your garage, buy cars at auction for yourself, and do a bit of driving (if you can stand the loading screens). It felt more like *your* garage, *your* business, *your* hobby. This feels more like ""doing your job"".I mean, it doesn't even give names to the engines you're working on! Each of the 3 engine types (diesel, electric, steam) seem to have no variations wthin them. That is, all diesels are exactly the same.For now, I think this is a ""no"", unless you get it on sale or just really like ""generic train engines""."
,Not Recommended,538810,30742917,Posted: 25 March,all,Brendansports,"Would like to report a bug where when you get to the steam engines workshop on Mission 7 I cant for some reason take off some parts, which makes the game unplayable after that mission since I cant complete it. :("
76561197974793790,Not Recommended,538810,30736500,Posted: 25 March,all,YotsuMD,"""75 storybased missions""I don't know what their idea of ""story"" is. Most of the jobs are along the lines of either ""train fell over, go fix"" or ""we brought train. Fix"".The ""open world"" segment of the game is pretty shallow. At no point does it feel like an immersive experience as much as it feel like an amusement park ride surrounded by props. This is especially obvious when you pass by ""Fakeville"" which is a train station platform surrounded by victorian style homes with no roads, or when you notice the pickup truck forever stuck at the same intersection. At first I was careful about going too fast with my train, but nah. You can't derail. Go full speed all you like. There's also no traffic on the rail network, despite the mission description at one point urging you to recover a vehicle quickly because there is. I guess these rails are cursed so that no one else can travel on them without breaking down or derailing.The repairing itself is the worst part. I've now learned that trains are held together with a handful of bolts, and that several parts aren't even fastened at all. They just slide right off. Fixing trains is super easy. Even easier than fixing cars.The overall impression of the game is that they've taken Car Mechanic Simulator and just shoved 4-5 train models into it, and simplified trains and  train repairs to the point of being patronizing. You barely even need to examine the parts to see which ones need repair. In this world, all defect parts are rusty and dirty, while the good parts surrounding them are spotless and pristine.Simulators aren't necessarily meant to be *fun*, and that's fine. But in that case it should at least be interesting. And failing that, it should at least be educational. TMS2017 goes stale fast. I'm already bored, and I've learned nothing."
,Not Recommended,538810,30742239,Posted: 25 March,all,stud915,Should have kept with what they did with Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 but instead it seems like they back tracked back to the useability of Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. Parts hard to see and you cannot really zoom in much. Graphics seem unfocused and blurry at times. Maybe if they fix some of these issues i may play again but until then ill stick with something else.
76561198030347461,Not Recommended,538810,30824902,Posted: 29 March,all,p.massimo,"I think the big problem with this game is right in the title: Train Mechanic Puzzle would have been more appropriate.IMHO a simulator should be a lot more detailed than this. There is no learning, no troubleshooting, no need for any sort of information... the game simply highlights where you should click, turning it in a VERY repetitive point and click ""puzzle"".I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who actually likes trains. Or simulations."

I bought the game today and hate it already. When you start it can be confusing. (Maybe just for me) The layout of the game is just like car mechanic simulator 2014 which looks awful.

76561198011382946,Not Recommended,538810,30737461,Posted: 25 March,all,t4chy,"At the moment I recommend not to buy TMS17.The whole thing feels very Early Access.Repair action is okay, like in Car Mechanic Simulator, for example, but there are some minor bugs with parts being linked to the wrong repair tables and slightly incorrect highlighting.The grafics are okay, but not outstanding.Loading screens when entering the target area for 'rescuing' locomotives (for plain towing, or for picking them up with the crane) and when you reach one of the depots. Yes, you do not manually couple/decouple anything, and you don't have to be careful about running into things.Hitting ESC will allow you to magic you back into the depot you started from.The map appears to have no zoom. Panning is not documented.There is no option to manually bind keys. It is hard coded for US keybord layout.If you do not have a US or UK keyboard, you might not quite enjoy the crane operation because you will have to find out which keys correspond to the ones the game tells you to use.The game does not allow you to use other devices but keyboard + mouse.Game picks up random input from devices. Yes, this means that you will have to unplug all input devices that are not primary mouse and primary keyboard, or the crane will perform random actions."
,Not Recommended,538810,30800943,Posted: 28 March,all,SelfRatedPro,"Jumping on board with the fad over the last few years of developing simulators, those who developed Train Mechanic Simulator 2017 have tapped into a market that has seen success already. Being a fan of railways myself, such a game is unique and appeals to my interests directly. So I purchased the game last Friday and beat it in only a few hours. Overall, here is what you can expect/ take away from this game.Pros:1)This is the only such game of its kind that I know of, and so since it was unique, I appreciate its existence quite a bit.2)Game is simple and easy to play. Not a game for those looking for any sort of mental challenge, but for a casual simulator game, it appeals to a basic desire to take things apart and reassemble them.3) It has trains. If you like trains, I'm sure you will like this title to some degree.Cons:1) Gameplay was mindblowingly repetitive. Many of the missions could have been diversified a little bit more to make it not seem so repetitive. Having to do the same thing for the 3 vehicle types over and over again turns fun into work.2)There are portions of the game where you will be allowed to drive a train around the map, where you will go pick up disabled locomotives. Or you will be tasked with using a crane to put a locomotive back on tracks. Not only are the driving mechanics clunky and hard to use, but the crane section is incredibly difficult. Controls don't always seem to want to respond, which can make the whole process annoying. Overall, the driving portion, since there is no free roaming where you can use the differrent trains to do tasks, seems unneeded. Not a feature I would champion or get to excited about.3) Sounds are somewhat unrealistic and repetitive. Though this is just a personal distaste for such things and may not apply to others.4) There is a mechanic where one earns currency which is then used to uprgrade the shop. But money is only used to upgrade the workbenches and bolt turning speed. The workbenches do not change graphically to represent these changes, and the lack of other options to spend this currency on is somewhat of a let down. Workbenches are designed to make it easier on the player to repair items and stay within budget, but there is also no penalty really to going over budget. You will still make money after each mission guaranteed.4) Steam Engines have no tenders. This looks really wierd and bugs the hell out of me.5) The game is very short. If I didn't care about completeing the tasks in full, and wanted to just speed run through the game, I could probably beat it, excluding loading times, in just about two hours. There is little variety in engine design, and no penalty, as already said, for not completeing a full task, or doing so overbudget.Overall, this game is probably worth around $10 year round. It's repetitive and boring after a while, If you are a fan of trains and railroading, then you will probably like this game, and may keep enthusiasm to play it straight through. If you are looking for a game with lots of options and diversity in gameplay, or some mental stimulation, then I would suggest you not purchase this game."

,Not Recommended,538810,31456867,Posted: 29 April,all,💋SayonaraBaby☠,"I wish I could recommend it but simply cannot.At first we had 4 very fast updates but still certain issues keep existing and communication with developers was already horrible when we wanted to know when the game will be released.There are a few ugly graphical glitches to one of the train models as well as some mission bugs which need urgent fixing but we dont get an update since weeks now.The game itself becomes very repeatative after 2-3 hours.The open world feels like a ride in an amusement park. Ok we have some branches and can switch to different tracks but they are horribly outlined and the curves are way too narrow, a real train couldnt pass or at least derail.Also the speed you can use in curves doesnt match a title which includes ""Simulator"".It would also have been nice to repair the carriages and drive with them through the open world, either passanger and freight.The positiv is you have some good looking locomitves (aside from the one with the mentioned graphical issues) and a very neat cabin few.If the open world was a little bigger and had some more details it would have looked decent.There is no other developer creating a train mechanic game and the idea is simply great.We have different weather effects and they look neat.I hope the devs havent abandonned the game and I might change the review if they change some of the major letdowns.Otherwise you might either try Train Sim World or simply wait till another developer team works on a decent train game.15 bucks is simply too much for it."
76561197982850115,Recommended,538810,34921014,Posted: 13 September,all,Apeman,"The game is a bit of fun... for a while. Below is my opinion of the game.Pros:- You can learn a lot about diesel, electric and steam trains- There are 75 missions in which certain parts in the trains are damaged and you have to repair them. That allows you to get to know different parts of your locomotives.- Beautiful open world in which you can drive around in your own train to pickup damaged trains along the tracks.- Earning money to spend on upgrading the workshop keeps things a bit more interesting.Cons:- All 75 story missions combined will be finished after about 6 hours.- The open ended gameplay after finishing the campaign consists of repeating random missions you already solved before. Some randomly generated faulty trains would have been way more interesting here.- You have three different workshops for the three types of trains. The functionality however is the same in all workshops. Makes it seem a bit pointless in my opinion.- The driving behaviour in the open world section of the game is horrible. Tight corners with high speed? No problem at all!- Some translations seem to be wrong or inaccurate.- Some parts like main connecting rods aren't fastened with any screw at all, For other parts like the  notorious lights in the steam engine you have to remove four seperate screws. This gives a wrong sense of importance for certain parts.- At some point, improving your workshop doesn't seem to do anything. The success chance of repairing some high end items does not increase above 66% and stays that way regardless whether your workbench is at level three, four or five.All in all the game is fun to play if you like technology and learning a bit about trains. I bought it at 40% off for about 9€ and don't feel like I wasted my money. Just don't expect to play it for weeks."

,Recommended,538810,30711285,Posted: 24 March,all,Limmin,"At last, a game that turns out almost exactly as expected!  Everything works!It is a combination of ""mini games"" and each holds its own quite well.  In a sense, it's kind of like a construction sim, in that you use different machines and do different things as you go through a ""mission.""The bread-and-butter is the (locomotive) train mechanic part.  Here, using the same style of work order-based repair gameplay previously seen in Farm Mechanic Sim / Truck Mechanic Sim, you diagnose and repair locomotive parts.  Drive train, brakes, engine and fuel systems are included for diesels, for instance.You progress from ""easy"" to ""hard"" and receive a new shop for each stage of development.  You start with Diesels, later on add Electrical Locomotives and Steam.To liven things up, you must venture out to pickup broken / stranded / derailed units.  In other words, you also are the ""tow truck.""  Movement about the little world is cute...not realistic at all but certainly entertaining.Playing this helped soothe the disappointment I've felt playing other recent train-sim releases.  ;)"

,Recommended,538810,34248212,Posted: 14 August,all,DeadPoolX,"Train Mechanic Simulator 2017 is similar in style and gameplay to other ""mechanic simulator"" titles, the best known of which is the Car Mechanic Simulator series. There are some big differences, however, and that saves TMS 2017 from becoming the ""same game with different graphics.""PROS:+ Trains! If you're reading this, then you at least have a passing interest in trains, and this game has three types: diesel, electric, and steam.+ Tried-and-true ""vehicle mechanic"" formula that's immediately familiar to fans of other ""mechanic"" games.+ Working on the different types of trains (diesel, electric, and steam) are all different enough that each is interesting, but not so different so you need to relearn the entire game when jumping to a new type.+ You can upgrade your workshop, so there's a good reason to earn money (other than the game telling you to do so).+ Three different workbenches in each workshop: mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic. This adds something new as other ""vehicle mechanic"" games tend to have one workbench for everything.+ On some work orders, you need to leave your workshop and drive a train to find another train that went off the rails or failed somehow. This is neat as you have a large map to explore and not only need to locate the damaged train, but use a crane to hoist it back up and onto the tracks so you can bring it back to your workshop. As far as I know, no other ""vehicle mechanic"" game has this in it.+ Multiple profiles, so no one has to worry about writing over someone else's save games.NEUTRAL:+/- You never have the opportunity to acquire a personal train collection, like you do with cars in CMS 2015 (and presumably CMS 2018, although I haven't played that yet). I understand the reasons for this as owning several train cars would be a logistical nightmare and simply wouldn't make unless you owned a museum, but even so, it's still slightly disappointing.CONS:- TMS 2017 is closer in gameplay to Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 (rather than CMS 2015 or the newest edition, CMS 2018) in that you do one work order after another. You never get to simply work on trains or upgrade them or anything like that.- You have to unlock the different train types. For instance, you need to complete a certain number of diesel work orders before gaining access to electric trains; likewise, you have to complete a set number of electric trains before accessing steam trains.- Despite being listed as a ""pro"" before, the work orders that require you to drive a train to seek another train to repair quickly become tedious. Don't get me wrong, it's a great idea and fun at first, but the enjoyment of finding the train you have to bring back and repair doesn't last.- You only get to drive ONE train. I realize this game is called Train Mechanic Simulator and not Train Simulator, but it would've been nice to see at least one train from each category (diesel, electric, and steam) that you could control.- No ability to rebind controls.- No Steam Cloud, so make sure to manually back up your saves.VERDICT: Despite Train Mechanic Simulator 2017's shortcomings, it offers a different experience from previous ""mechanic"" games and adds in new features that go beyond the workshop.If you're interested in trains and like fixing vehicles, I'd definitely recommend picking this game up."

I've played the car mechanic simulator and loved it, I was looking forward to a new challenge with this game but was largely let down. This game isn't really intuitive and you really have to know what to look for to figure out the problems. I really wouldn't recommend this game to someone looking for a similar product to other out there, you'll be disappointed."

The open world has more of a toy train set feel, the graphics are nice and the soundtrack is easier to listen to than the one in Car Mechanic Simulator. For under $10 its a good deal."

It seems like most of the things are correct and that there is detail down to the smallest thing. some things are anoying things like settings tend to not save or that there are wrong names for certain things but overall its a really great game. i like that you have to go out and put the trains back on the rails. there are things that should be part of the game thought like a personal shed where you can keep all of your trains that you can build by buying the parts for it. then also adding more maps and carriages that can be in the way of a broken down train. also being able to choose what type of towing engine one has would be neat too see wich i hope comes in the futurethe price for the game i find is a bit high but it dosent matter since its not a clear overpriced. i hope that this game does fix the minor anoyances wich do tend to make the game less fun.

,Recommended,538810,30784998,Posted: 27 March,all,Sia7hrust,"Now I normally don't post reviews on Steam but I feel this game is an exception.First I do have to get something off my chest that's REALLY bugging me about this gameMy biggest issue is that the control information is severly delayed. By the time you finish moving the mouse it takes about half a second later before your vision moves. I really don't like this as it makes the game feel like it's performing poorly when in actually it's performing pretty well for a high graphics game (even on lowest settings) on my 2015 Cyberpower Cybertron PC.It's not really the sensitivity that's bothering me but the overall controll responsiveness that really urks me about the game. While I would normally drum it down to having a new wireless mouse the effects carry onto my Keyboard, and when navigating menues my mouse works as perfectly as a wired one. This is honestly a BIG issue that many players are actually complaining about this game and I agree. however they keep refering to it as ""Sensitivity"" whereas it should be called ""Responsiveness"".Now that we have that genuine gaming complaint out of the way here are a couple of Railfan complaints from me...1: Diesles do NOT have sparkplugs.2: The corners in this game are WAY too sharp for the train you drive to realistically drive on. Don't even get me started on the STEEP grades and trackside Railroad hazards! No wonder these trains keep breaking down! They can't take the turns and they can't take the grades!Now with that said is it a bad game? No! It's actually a suprisingly informative game about fixing broken down Engines and making money off of it! It's definately worth the $15 (Or $12 as I bought it during a sale!) at least if you want to give it a good look!Being a railfan since 3 years of age I've LOVED trains but never really knew much about the internal workings untill I played this game. It's gonna take a little while longer for me to entirely comprehend ALL the innerworkings of the average SD class Diesle locomotive but untill then I have this game to get me started! The controls are simple and easy to use although they look complicated it's really not that bad.I honestly give this game a 4 out of 5. Almost a perfect game but not quite. It has the potential but lacks in the realism and control responsiveness departments. If it weren't for the curves/grades and lagging controls I'd definately give this game a 5 out of 5, but at the moment I just can't give it that."

I especially like jobs that involve taking everything apart to get to a damaged part and then having to assemble it all again. The game may be a little repetitive and limited at the moment, but this game has potential. The train driving feature has nice graphics, even if the tracks look a little toy trainish, with very sharp turns. But that said it's still a nice feature to be able to go and recover broken down and derailed locos, especially working the crane. As a fun, relaxing game, I would score this 9/10 and recommend it, if this type of game appeals to you."

There are only three basic engines in the game, with massive overlap between two of them and a minor variant of the steam engine. Both variants are essentially the same 4-6-2 engine.You can drive around but the map feels like someone's model railroad track. I was playing with visual blur off. I would have attempted to apply a frustrum or used procedural generation with a deterministic seed to allow a much larger map. There isn't much to the driving, you can try to crash into your target at full throttle and it does nothing. Once you reach your target, it always flips your train to some pre-set dricetion and position. You can't plan out and say attach the target train to the front of your train, or do any other type of planning.There are only 75 missions divided between the three workshops. After finishing the ""campaign"" you are given random selections from those 75, there's no way to select specific missions to try, or track your score on each mission to try to get better. Still, it's kinda nice having a train game, this one is probably not the best..."

,Recommended,538810,31331206,Posted: 23 April,all,Monterico Gaming TV,The game as it stands for $15 at full price has some decent graphics. The gameplay is very linear but takes you through the progression of the different style trains nicely. The open world mentioned is more of a glorified model train set but an epic model train set with different spots of scenery. During the linear campaign it will send you out into the world and use a crane (simple to use) to pick up a troubled loco and return to the garage. I was a bit shocked that you could actually drive from the cab and control the brakes and such. I think this adds to the game compared to being stuck just in the garage. Maybe they could have added some on site repairs as well to do a little more out in the world.The Garage - You do simple contracts. It easily guides you on how to remove and assemble parts. (simple left click and drag the highlighted spots) I can see how some one something a bit more real but compared to going to a train depot and getting your hands dirty this game is a good place to start and hopefully will spark some interest in learning more about trains.As you play you earn a profit that you can spend to upgrade the garage. This was executed poorly as you really do not control the money early on and just are buying new parts to fix things and selling off the old parts. You can upgrade your benches and try and do soem repairs as well. I did not actually catch this at first. With the linear direction they took they might as well have had the garage auto upgrade or unlock special tools after each mission completion.Again I wish the game had more but it is a $15 game. I wish it was a $40 budget game with more content. What it does have is worth it. Against most others I say this one gets a Yes.This was not a press copy.

After you beat the game  - approximatelly 14h - you can come back to do repairs with your upgraded workstations if you press ""continue"" when you start the game again and I think these new repairs are little different then those you got during the game missions.The open world  - which by the way, it looks really beautiful and it is quite large - let's you travel to the specific repair depots so you have the option to choose which ones you like to do first. There are 4 trains in the game; one diesel, one electric and two steam if we consider only their mechanical design variations and not the aesthetics.There are very small bugs in the game, and none of them is game breakig.
