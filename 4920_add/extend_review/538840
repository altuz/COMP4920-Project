76561197995451996,Recommended,538840,30157540,Posted: 24 February,all,fish,"I've enjoyed my experience in this game thus far.It reminds me a lot of I am Bread since they both are humorous game about traversing through an environment with a ragdoll-like protagonist.It's a little more linear than I am Bread in the sense that there pretty much only one direction to go, but this allows the player to get into a groove where they can just move quickly across the map without having to stop and figure out where they're going.The only game mechanic I have problems with is electricity. In one of the earlier levels there is a cut cable that will kill you if you touch it while it's sparking. I've found that it only kills you half the time and it seems to work at random. I'm not sure if that's because the game is in 2.5D and I just so happen to its side or what.My only suggestion is that an option be added that lets you free both of your hands without losing. It would be fun to propel yourself upwards or catch yourself if you start to fall off of a tower.I can tell the developer really cares about this game and isn't just some hack trying to make a quick buck. I look forward to future updates in the game, as well as future projects from the creator. I think you've really put your best foot forward with this game, great job."

I'll list pros and cons.Pros:-Easy controls, once you get used to it its real fun.-Nice difficulty curve, Always hard, not super hard that it makes you rage, I have to say it enhances the experience.-The ragdoll physics, It makes the game harder and more fun to see how much strange positons you can be.-Pretty good graphics, on best it looks pretty epic, I haven't tried lower.-Concept, on story you always have to have one hand on solid ground, If you let go, you lose.Cons:-Grabbing, I had a few moments where I did grab something and then the game didn't recieve the grab and I lose.-Tutorial, you have no idea where to go first, your kinda clueless untill you click the story button and play it."

The good news is, it runs great! Even on my crappy laptop it runs perfectly even on the best settings. Bravo on that! However...Granted, I've stopped before trying level 9. Level 8 was probably one of the more fun levels because of the length, but the ones before it were mediocre at best. But, I noticed that there were only, what, 14 levels? If that is the case, then that makes for one very short game.My problem is with the controls. The mouse control idea is brilliant, and I found no problem finding something to grab onto which surprised me. When I saw ""You can only grab certain things"" I thought ""Geez, this game is probably linear as heck"" and even though you do have a set course to climb, it feels rather free. It's hard to find a good game that achieves that happy medium. But, your little climber guy gets stuck all the time! In the levels where youescape from the hospitalit just feels like your arms are glitching all over the place.I will say that I did enjoy when some things would randomly fall and you would have to find something else to grab, that's a wonderful mechanic that adds a nice challenge. But to me the story just falls short of entertaining.My suggestion? Tweak level design a bit to add something more complicated to make the levels a bit harder (or add difficulty, even, so we can choose). I gather it may take about an hour, hour and a half to complete the whole story, which is what I expect of a $7 game. But, I'm glad I caught it on sale.In conclusion, I'm giving this game a good rating, and I wont be getting any kind of refund because I believe in supporting indie developers. However, I feel like with just a bit more effort, this game could be something really awesome to play."

,Recommended,538840,30183723,Posted: 25 February,all,Travel with Bard,"Great Game, as many have said already, it's like a combo of Mount your Friends and I am Bread. I love the fact that this game is done all by one person. It's already more solid then most tripple A games. However, grabbing things in this game is quite annoying. I mean I was stretching for things, the plus sign comes up and I let go of the bumper and he lets the arm fall then I let go with the other hand and bing bada boom I'm at the start again. I think I said ""grab it you ****"" about 374 times. Also grabbing onto bars and then not being able to reach the next one because you grabbed the other side of it was awkward to deal withAll in all, solid game, love it and I'm glad this guy's body is flexible enough to go through bars."

,Recommended,538840,30264530,Posted: 1 March,all,Scabard,"Here's some gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7wP0dur1jQCity Climber is a short but very entertaining physics game. The music is catchy, although loops a little on longer levels and the controls are well implemented, allowing both controller and mouse input depending your preference. I like to use the mouse as it allows precise movement of the arms, left and right mouse buttons control grip for their repsective hands.The game isn't very long, it currently has 14 levels which are somewhat replayable due to a speed runners leaderboard and also a challenge mode which has 3 challenges spread across 30 stages (3x10). I wouldn't recommend for anyone looking for a lengthy experience but it has allot of charm, is well polished and the controls are allot of fun to grapple with.There is also a character customiser where you can change the colour of your character and also add various headwear such as pirate hats and spy glasses, these are unlocked as you progress through the game.There is multiplayer support, the story mode (14 levels) has a co-op mode where two players each control an arm. You need two controllers for this, one can use mouse whilse the other uses a pad. There is also turn based party play where up to four people take turns to plough through the levels in a hope to out pace their friends. It's a nice addition to have multiplayer in the game and it adds some replayability.All in all I recommend the game, it's cheap and chearful but could benefit from some workshop support."

,Not Recommended,538840,34115750,Posted: 8 August,all,Ender,"I played the, more family unfriendly, Mount Your Friends, which, in its controls, seemed pretty similar on the surface. Hold a button to activate the movement of a limb and use the joysticks to move those limbs, with this game just removing the ability to use your legs; a perfectly nice concept. However, after playing the first 3 levels, it became infuriating difficult. I got through levels 1 and 2 of the story mode pretty quickly, using my joystick to move the arms upwards and grab at the red rocks. Even loved howsome of the rocks and the ladder fell in level 2(put it in spoilers just in case). Whenever I got to level 3, though, the controls became extremely awkward. With holding down on the joystick not moving the arms towards the ground and having to be touching the object you want to grip to, the level became a giant mess, not to mentionthe electric wire making you have to time movements. If the controls were better, this level would've been much easier, but due to the game being in a 3D environment, the control scheme doesn't work well for ground crawling, especially with the gripping system.I feel like if you can get past the control issues I mentioned here, the level design and level quirks are pretty nice. The spoilers contain quirks for levels 2 and 3, and I bet there are a lot more in the later levels. However, I personally feel that, especially for games like this, good controls can make or break the experience. Want a game that can make you rage but still has fun level design? This is a pretty good candidate. Other than that, for the casual gamer, this is a definite not recommended from me."

,Recommended,538840,30151195,Posted: 24 February,all,Taccotoast,"Cool idea, a 2.5D climbing game (3D graphics, but you're basically climbing in a 2D space).However, one thing ruins the game for me personally; as soon as both your hands are not grabbed onto something, the game is over, wihout giving you a chance to catch yourself.This makes climbing a slow and careful procedure, which is weird for a game running on a timer scoreboard.I'd give this game a 4/10 in its current state.I'll still recommend this game, as some people may not be bothered as much as me by this one problem."

This game is revolutionizing the Pay to Lose genre - you buy it, you lose.  There is no replayability whatsoever.  Story mode is repetitive (but not overly bad) and the other ""gamemodes"" are just luck-based with zero timing or skill required.  Save your money."

76561198125318923,Not Recommended,538840,33492536,Posted: 12 July,all,bloodthirsty,"worst game in the world. There is one fatal flaw that makes this game worthless. THE FACT THE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO GRAB ON TO SOMETHING! I know that's the point of the game, but the the way it works is: if neither of your arms are connected to a ledge, wall, or post, you fail. the game stops you in your tracks and makes you restart. When I bought this game, I expected to be able to swing around freeley in a semi-open world. I didn't expect to move one arm at a time like a game of chess! The multiplayer is even worse. the co-op mode has each player control one arm, which means each player has to sit and wait like ten seconds at a time for the other person to grip something before they can even try. not to mention, the controls are awful. there is also a multiplayer ""party"" mode where the players once again, take turns falling down some stairs or something. Because the first thing I want to do in a party is watch my friends  awkwardly try to move there little noodle of a character around to grip something. don't buy this game unless you want to inflict psychological torture among your friends, who will probably insult you for buying such a terrible game. If the developer is listening, please fix your game, instead of the one at a time rule, add a death barrier  on the floor or something so I can maybe try to catch myself, make it a the floor is lava type thing, and make the multiplayer, well, multiplayer. It would be hilarious to have two little noodle guys holding on to each other for dear life whilst dangling over a cliff or tower. This would be one of my favorite game if these features were added. But until they are, DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!! it sucks!"

The climbing was attrocious, the random and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t areas where if you hold on it falls off, and the absolute abominabal way the ragdoll gets stuck everywhere. The controls are terrible the way you have to move him about with a mouse is ungodly bad and broken. The levels are incredibly short and never seems to amaze me.
