I posted this review earlier today, and Geoff spent the whole day pushing updates and messaging me until the crash but was finally fixed! Now I can act out my desire for power over an uneducated tribe without worries!"
,Not Recommended,539050,31157898,Posted: 15 April,all,MrRedstoneWolf,"It's a really cool game and it has loads of potential,but there haven't been any updates for 4 months now and the developers don't respond to people in the discussions anymore.At the moment there are 10 levels you can play and they get harder at the end. But the last one seems like it is impossible to win it in time.So there isn't too much content and the developers don't seem to be active anymore.If this game got some more content I would recommend it but I can't now.EDIT: A new update dropped with some fixes and a small addition. But this update didn't add new levels which is disappointing. I hope they will add some new content soon so I can give a postive review. I played it for about 9 hours and did some levels again, I even let other people play it. But even though it's a nice game, it's not worth the money at the moment."

The game requires a lot of movement, scaling and rotation to navigate your surroundings; in a way that gave me more motion sickness than any other VR game I've played. Additionally, the game is clunky and lacks the detail/charm that games like Black & White had. Conceptually it's a great idea, but it's a bit more ""early access"" than I'm willing to pay for. I look forward to a more finished experience."

With a stylized approach with the graphics, and fantastic motion control handling. Definitely one of my favorite VR games already!!!Check out the gameplay here!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfdshrK0JFU"

For being early access it has a decent amount of content, especially compared to other VR titles.  This game has a solid foundation and I am excited to see what else they add.  I did want to throw out a few things I would like to see or at least considered:-Being able to unassign villagers from a role.  I would like to be able to pick up a fisher and make them a blank slate if need be.  Maybe you could pick up a villager and shake your hand back and forth to do this?-As resources get used and you move, it would be great to be able to destroy things like the lumbermill or quarry and get some sort of resource return on them as you look to build one elsewhere-More miracles would be great.  Things such as fireball, healing, etc.-A tutorial would be nice to kind of explain the basics of the game and maybe even some of the more subtle things.  I am stuck on level 5 and I can't say I know what the temple does.  On that note, could be beneficial to have tool tips when looking at these items in the menu.-I hope graphics options and especially super sampling is added into the game soon.  This game doesn't use much of my GPU and it would be great to be able to make this game more crisp.-I will add that I would like a freeplay mode, but it looks like that is a feature coming soon.  Kudos to the devs for adding this.These are just suggestions after playing the game for a bit, but I figured it couldn't hurt to pass them along.  Overall, I have high hopes for this game and I hope the developers keep adding to it.  One of the best VR experiences I have had so far."
,Recommended,539050,26638027,"Posted: 16 November, 2016",all,Dan Dixon,Really excited to see how this improves over time.Would like to see the grip buttons used for movement and zoom instead of the triggers... so you could have menus open and still move around the world. Also had issues with trying to move and grabbing something instead.

76561198039836745,Not Recommended,539050,32095544,Posted: 31 May,all,Kildon,"I never write reviews, but I feel kinda obligated to do so on this one. I agree with others, in that this game had a TON of potential, but appears to have been abandoned (no updates since 2016). If the dev releases future updates, or if you are REALLY interested in playing a God simulator game even if you only about 2hrs worth of it, then this game would be worth it. As is, despite being someone who loved Black and White, I'm really glad I got it on sale, and I'm still not sure I got my money's worth.** UPDATE 7/4/17: So this game just got its first update in a LONG time. It is a very minor one, but it is an update nonetheless. I still feel like I can't recommend it given the long delay between updates, but if we see an actual content update in the near future, I will definitely be switching to a thumbs-up."

The premise is pretty simple, you grow a population of villagers, direct them in building structures, and assign them duties to achieve a specific objective. You'll find the increasing level of difficulty in the objectives pleasantly surprising.We recommend this game to those who not only want to be almighty and powerful, but also enjoy solving puzzles and maybe learn some anthropology basics!"
76561197963819455,Recommended,539050,28616573,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,Jinnai,"So much potential for this game, but plagued by difficult and/or buggy control scheme.The missions are pretty straight forward and the game reminds me a lot of Populous.  There's not a whole lot to do just yet that I can see, but a sandbox mode will make this game a fun waste of time.  The graphics are perfect for the current generation of VR, and interacting with world objects feels smooth and responsive.  My only complaint is the movement controls, zooming in and out, and changing elevation.  9 times out of 10 the controls just refuse to work for me as depicted in the instructions.  Given some missions have you moving around putting out fires this is a problem.  If the controls can be smoothed out and more content added (as this is early access) then there's definite potential here."

,Recommended,539050,26624924,"Posted: 15 November, 2016",all,BorsKaegel,"UPDATED:This game has promise! I absolutely enjoy the full 'Black and White' style gameplay. At this early stage the AI is simplistic and even the instructions are really unclear for objectives on occasion, but I am digging it. Can't wait to see more!ORIGINALREVIEW:I realize this is early access, but it isn't even stable enough to try out. When my game loaded the UI stuttered constantly, making me feel slightly ill. There are no graphical options that I could find, but I eventually found the controls - fairly intuitive. When I finally started the first level, it was virtually unplayable due to the graphical glitches and frame drops. The icing on the cake is when you try to exit - the game goes into full glitchy epilepsy mode that actually made me so queasy that I removed my headset.(Specs for the devs: i7-4790k, 16GB mem, 8GB R9 390 - well within requirements.)EDIT: I have decided to keep the game. The developers seem to be very responsive and quick to fix, so I'll check this game out later on in the development process."

It's definitely like no other VR experience I've had yet. It took me a minute or two to figure out stuff but caught on quickly after. The controls are pretty easy to get use to and the game runs smooth. The village people are funny and derpy and I like the little noises they make. There were parts where they would get stuck doing work and block others from turning in their resources but it only happened a few times and was resolved by me scooting the person aside which would get them back on track. Definitely look forward to more miracles!

,Recommended,539050,29298676,Posted: 16 January,all,ChivalricSloth,"This is a fun little God simulator. The basic premise is short levels with very set objectives. This does keep the levels from getting draw out, or boring. However, I was expecting something with a bit more leniency or creativity. Kind of more along the lines of a RTS game. Instead it sometimes feels like a mobile game with its short levels and three star rating system. Still a fun game, and I'm looking forward to see where it goes."

I had an issue with it though. With the top down view (constant zooming in and out), plus menu on the left control moving about, i could only play for 3 levels before getting motion sick. Problem is most often i'd leave the menu open instead of closing it.Nonetheless, a little puke is definitely worth the game. :D"

This is one of the first games I purchased for the Vive when it was first released and it quickly became one of my favorites.   It's someone short and simple but very interesting and you could easily spend hours playing.The developers just updated this game on July 4th, Freedom Day, and because of that this game is not dead.  I for one am extremely excited to see what the future of this game holds for everyone.  I hope people who gave negative reviews because of the inactive development will change theirs to refelct that.Buy this!  10/10"
76561197983451227,Recommended,539050,26754591,"Posted: 22 November, 2016",all,LandonBee,"This is a fantastic game! I'm sure you can see from other reviews, it is very ""Black & White"" minus a creature (which I don't mind). You get 6 levels to play, each with an exponential increase in difficulty. (I just beat level 4, and the time attack is just ""finish the level"").My only complaint is I would like to see difficulty settings (but only because I actually want a sandbox mode). It can be deflating after building a great little village and almost completing an objective, only to hit the 10 minute mark and have to start all over. :( :( :(I'm a huge fan of city builders and this application of VR really nails it. Hopefully we can get a huge island and sandbox mode to just transport into, away from reality, and make the perfect tribe.Super Island God is the most immersive VR game I have played yet, and I attribute it to the ""FLYING"" movement mechanics, instead of teleport-to-move mechanics. However, for this reason, I don't recommend this as your very first VR game, as the flying can be very nauseating until you get used to VR.It is early access, so it has its quarrels:~The food rate info also seems broken/non-intuitive, possibly will get fixed soon?~Stutters a little on the 970, but is extremely immersive and great for it's price.Also I recommend changing your chaffeur colour to red or something else dark, as I bumped into a lot of things while playing this because the default colour dissapears into the friendly island colour scheme.TL;DR : Best VR Game I've played, Fly to move (not teleport), only 10 minutes of play per level (then you lose), needs a sandbox mode (or not 10 minutes), very fun God Sim (like Black & White)."

My eyes were hurting a bit after playing, which Ive never got from some of the other games I've tried out.The controls are a little clunky, trying to move yourself up or down is a task itself, I prefer to just stay up high and grab things/people from the sky than actually down on the ground.I look forward to see how this game develops."
