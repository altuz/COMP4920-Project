,Recommended,539340,30541151,Posted: 16 March,all,Hydrogenius,"(UPDATED) I finished the game and my view of the game changed.Below are my experience 1-2 hours in the game:- I was addicted to Rocket League.- I like game like The Witness, ABZU, Firewatch, Grow Home/Up, Trine 2.- I was bored because I don't have much time to play game.- I can't afford to play long sessions games, games with lot of story element like RTSs, RPGs, MOBAs.- I just wanted to relax, wander and enjoy.- I found out about Future Unfolding.- I stopped my Rocket League9/10 must try if you feel the way I feel.After completing the game:- Since the game don't guide you much, you may feel lost when you get stuck in a world and don't know how to proceed. This can get frustrating. However, steam forum and online guide can help you get pass certain part of the game.- My little OCD force me to trace out every possible path of the world too. If you enjoy exploring, this can be good. However, the game doesn't do too well in rewarding the player when they explore the world. You can just skip part of the world and finish the game.- The length of the game is a bit too long and tiring imo. There are 9 worlds to explore, but each world feel too similar to the other world to make it enjoyable.- The ending is debatable as well. It's carry 'deep meaning', together with what you've seen in the game, the ending kind of make sense. However, it's not a particular satisfying ending. There is no 'wow' or self reflection.Overall, I enjoyed the game. I would only recommend this game to those who truly want to relax and wander. Beside that, this is not for those who enjoy solving puzzle, for those who want to have a sense of achievement.If I have to give it a score, and if Trine 2 is 10/10 for me, this game should score:7/10(Nice game but have a few quirks that dampened the experience)Thanks for reading my review."

Even then, there's no preamble, no ""this is why you are here"". So you just have to touch stuff and see what happens......and things do happen....wonderfully animated things....you don't have to walk to far to find a ""questgiver"" of sorts. In fact, hje's a bit of an ""anti-questgiver""...he basically says don't try and figure out why you're here..go do some more stuff, see what happens.Explore. Interact. Fail. Try something different. Think you're stuck when you're not. Realise that sheep are more powerful than they appear (doubly so when wet).Great game. 10/10/"

,Recommended,539340,30780617,Posted: 27 March,all,thedinosaurjr48,"Ten thumbs up. You'll certainly need them all. Best game I've ever found via following steams suggestions and reviews that were ""positive"". Personally I'd say it was ""overwhelmingly positive"". Awe-striking complexity. Loved everything about it, especially how music and movement drives the whole mission. Also fun to have to figure out everything for yourself throught the whole game. Beautiful graphics even my laptop could run. Ever since dowloading, I've either been playing this game or searching steam for a way to find alike games. 10/10!"

This goes beyond just presenting a mystery within the game, I'm talking about having important aspects of the game that need to be figured out with next to no explanations. First thing to come to mind would be Dark Souls, which made you work to figure out some of its systems and most of its lore. Betrayer might be a better example; What to do, and how to go around doing it? Well, it's up to you to find out. Night Shift was almost 100% this, but unfortunately no one played that.The best thing is that this aura of mistery fits all of these games - it enhances and makes sense for them. It's not just broken logic, a bad translation or lack of budget for proper tutorials. It's an integral part of what they are.Future Unfolding might be the purest example of this I've played yet. You start off with a couple of actions available to you, and from there, with observation and experimentation, you'll need to work out how to interact with the environment and advance in the game.We might be looking at a new-ish genre. I humbly suggest calling it WTF'em up.I'm loving it to pieces. There's not much I can say without going into spoilers, but: it's a top-down exploration game with procedural environments and puzzles. It looks and sounds great and it's got a great in-game automap. It plays like nothing else out there I know of, but there's definitely structure to it, and a (dream) logic.The game does feel a bit overlong, with large environments that can be a slog to map completely; going through forests becomes a bit tiresome. That's probably my fault, though, since I'm trying to map and find everything. It usually doesn't take too long to find a new enigma and the environments have decent variety. Also (for now), it's all mystery and no plot. There's some lore here and there but most of it comes off as mystic mumbo jumbo.Future Unfolding is a great game that's really hard to recommend, since I can easily see someone bouncing off it hard. Still, recommend it I do. Just be forewarned."
,Recommended,539340,30738275,Posted: 25 March,all,taloketo,"Note: This is not a ""should I buy"" type of review. It's more an analysis of the game, and will spoil some stuff in the game. Future Unfolding is best enjoyed without knowing anything about it other than that it's about exploration, so read on your own risk.Future Unfolding is a game about mysteries, and finding your place in nature. More specifically, it's a game about running around in procedurally generated natural habitats, and figuring out hidden rules. How to ride a deer? Which bushes are teleporters? How to move rocks? How to use the snake for your adventage? The game explains absolutely nothing. You are on your own. This is its strength and weakness.Some of the things I'll write will feel like I'm complaining too much. These don't mean that the game is bad. But they do mean that it could be better.The game is visually very pleasing in motion. Straight up, if you liked Proteus, I think you should get this game. Just to experience running around in top down view, and exploring. Player movement is joyful, the nature is playful, and everything looks beautiful.Now, about the rules... There are a lot of them, but you don't need all of them to finish the game. Some of them are really easy to find, like riding a deer. Some of them more complex, like teleporting with sheep, and what you take with you while teleporting. And some of them I just cannot find. One time an animal told me that I can hug snakes, I kept trying to press B on the controller while on top of snakes, nothing happened. That's the thing about not telling anything directly. Some things are bound to create confusion. I'm still curious if there's a rule I couldn't find about the snakes.One of the things that bother me is that on most areas with enemies, you can just run away and you'll be fine. It's luck based rather than skill, so you might have to try a few times. This makes the game feel loose. Like, there are rules but some rules are just boring (collect the lake leaves through the flowers to find a new path, repeat 10 times). And most challenges are not fun. Like the lions. You'll be chased around. But the chase won't give you an adrenaline rush, you'll just be annoyed when you get killed.That's my main gripe with the game. Almost every element in the game feels overused. Some puzzles are really nice, but then they are repeated again and again, same rules apply in tens of areas. There are times the feeling of exploration leaves itself to the feeling of monotony. But I still finished the game, and I'm glad I did. I saw a beautiful ending cutscene as my reward.Let's talk story. There is one. But it's hard to get invested in it. It talks about your position in nature as a humanbeing. It tells you to not look for meaning. It wants you to simply exist, and enjoy. It's good that the story wants to put you in a mood where you'll have the most fun out of the game. And the writing is good. There are some beautiful quotes in there. But there's also a moment where an animal just says ""I have nothing to say, go further"". That feels pretty bad. Also, the way you learn the story is by finding a white animal, and it saying a few words. I think I could be invested in the story more if things were more dynamic. If I could travel with talking animals and they could develop deep personalities. If there was actual tension. If there was something to lose or gain. If my character had personality. Instead, the game goes heavy on taoist themes, which are beautiful, but again, can feel overused.The sounds and music were minimal, but they work just fine.My favorite part of the game has to be the procgen, and the render technics used to make 2D sprites feel 3D, But that's quite technical. I wish the hidden game rules had more weight. I didn't really feel like I was smart when I solved a puzzle. And the repetition gets really bad sometimes. I unlocked just half of the achievements. But I feel like I had enough. Beautiful game, I am very glad I played it, but you have to be okay with some of its weird design decisions."

I'd best descibe it as an exploration adventure.It's interesting how you don't truly understand what's going on and still get sucked into exploring all the environments.I've only seen the beginning of a huge world that feels vibrant and interesting, filled with mysteries, puzzles and awesome weirdness.If you're into exploration and puzzles this is a must-play for you!"

,Not Recommended,539340,34298740,Posted: 16 August,all,Vertx,"I sadly wasn't entertained, what intrigue I had was quickly dashed by time consuming running around trying to find something that stood out. Once I found something, I eventually figured out what I had to do, but then I was again teleported to a new place to do more tedious running around.I personally couldn't get enough out of the landscape or music to warrant my time being spent running from A-all-over-to-B to find the interesting parts of the game, I'm usually more capable of finding patience for games like these, but this wasn't one of them."

Obfuscation of the very few possible interactions that you have with your world is the 'mystique' behind the game's aesthetic. There is no gameplay, no story, and no significant score or media to warrant the tag price of the product if purchased as a standalone ambient audio compilatin."
