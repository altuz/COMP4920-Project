Have played twelvesky for many years in different servers. This one still requires alot to be fxed in game. However, the first pririority should be given to  new players in leveling up or provide decent % enchanted rare gears(non-tradable) for grinding.  Currently, enchanting materials are more expensive than skills and its hard to find in game.Request old school players to give a try on this game."

If you like MMOs with PvP this one is the ultimate choice.The game however has it's own history for a couple of years now but the constant upgrading just made it even better. Good to have it on Steam now, deserved it very much.So let me introduce some nice features:- 3 factions to choose from (Guanyin-Dragon ; Jinong-Tiger ; Fujin-Serpent) - and stay tooned for Nangin-Sky (not released yet)- 3 weapon types to fit your preferences- Pet system with lots of pets to accompany with- Mount system with plenty of beasts to ride on- Wars in every 1,5 hours to your level - exp and money even if you loose- Faction all out war called Holy Stone Battle where you are to steal your enemy's Holy Stone for damage boost, or to defend your own! (It's just EPIC)- You can invade other factions any time, raiging through their territory till their main town to pillage- Massive grind system with Auto Hunt feature - so no more boring grinding you can freely afk- Grind for loot or kill Boss monsters!- PvP for even more loot and to collect Contribution Points to become even stronger- Easy to use Trade system - direct trade and shop based- Easy enchanting system to upgrade your gear- The best of all - lead you own faction to glory - Faction leader election system with assistants to appoint. The community leads itslef and make decisions.And many more to explore. The game has a lot of unpublished content yet so it has a huge potential.The community is growing day by day so get in, join the fun.Don't think you are late - you can get to the top in no time thanks to the nice exp and drop boost events.So this games is a 10/10 and a must have for any PvPer MMO fan :)Unleash your wrath to your foes NOW!P.S.: We have cookies! :)"

That game held my heart to an outrageous extent. After the game finally closed all it's servers, I was looking for another martial, Asian inspired game that allowed progression, farming, interaction, and over all a good story. I picked up 12 sky 1 not long after and from there began another long term relationship. I have played 12 sky 1 and 12 sky 2 (MaynGames), and I could not be any happier to hear that this game is now on steam. This game is truly worth the countless hours of game play. If there was ever a good mmorpg game that I would recommend to any one, 12 sky 2 is most definitely in the top 5 games. This is a MUST PLAY! Story and PVP are by far one of the best I have ever experienced because all mobs, bosses, and players (pvp) would be within your characters fighting range. I'm so excited for this!"

,Recommended,539650,29853319,Posted: 11 February,all,Censon,"This game is amazing! I used to play by the name of Rammus on old Twelve Sky 2 servers on MAYNGAMES and AERIAGAMES, however Red Fox seems like a legit company.Twelve Sky 2 is a classic old school MMORPG, with awesome combat, interesting concept, and deep politics and faction intrigues. Once our faction (Dragon - Guanyin) became so strong that other factions paid us tributes. We had 10% experience boost from captured stronghold (Dragonfall), and 40% damage boost from stones.It is very good, and I highly recommend it. I'm going to return to play it again, because it's a very fun and addicting game."

I've played this game like most of you have, a good 3-4 different versions. To anybody new, the company hosting company has an active game master ""Shinnen"", he responds quickly in forums. They host great events, and gears are easy to come by. It's really a great community so far."

I haven't experienced any bug from RedFox games up to now. Not only is the game good but the developers are 10x better than Mayn. Plus they added some awesome new features. You should give the game a try. 10/10
