,Recommended,539660,30918864,Posted: 3 April,all,fraGGy,"It's a very enjoyable and straightforward game where you always know on which girl's route you are. It took me 36 hours to complete.Story.I won't write any details here but I'll say it's mostly slice of life type of story. The game promises you it's nothing serious but that doesn't mean you won't cry. I did. It just means there are no bad ends.Characters.You have your typical anime archetypes: tsundere, overly attached sister, shy girl, blonde from overseas, etc. Despite beign clichéd they are not boring by any means, in fact I feel each one of them brings something fresh into this pungent bog of stereotypes. There are 6 girls to court, 4 initially available and 2 unlocked after.Voices.Fully voiced except the protagonist. The seiyuu work is quite exceptional, those are the voices you don't want to skip. There are introduction videos for every girl on Sekai Project website, check it if you want.Art and sound.Great. Characters are beautifully designed, backgrounds are gorgeous, music is very good and catchy.There are no H-scenes in Steam version of the game. But if you can get an unrated version—do it, you won't regret it.Cons.This game would be perfect if not for bad editing. The editor should be fired and never allowed to touch game script ever again. I'm used to overlocalisation, I don't like it but I know why it's sometimes needed. What I'm NOT used to is butchering lines beyond recognition, frivolously adding quirks, and dropping f-words on regular occasion. Seriously, whats with insane amount of swearing? There are more f-bombs than in a B-rated movie. One of the girls often uses english words so the editor chose to use romaji in her lines and it's not a pleasant reading experience. But it's the only problem with the game really.TL;DR.It's an ejoyable SOL type of game with gorgeous art, suberb voice acting and catchy music. You will like every girl and upon completing the game you'll wish to forget it and play again."
,Recommended,539660,31381622,Posted: 26 April,all,Zen,"""ChronoClock"", is certainly one of ""superior"" visual novel out there.If you're looking for a light heart-warming romance story with some spice of comedy, then this is certainly the one.Now, now, let's just get straight into the plus and minus of the product, shall we?Pros:-Great art(Nothing's really more satisfying than playing a VN with great character design, art, background, etc. Tres Bien! Truly a feast to the eyes)-Great characters(The characters are not one dimensional, their personality is amazing, even if it's the same cliche things like blonde foreigner transfer student, or little sister that lust over her brother, or a tsundere underclassman, this VN has succeed in making us, readers, attached to these type of seemingly ""cliche"" characters. Yes, EACH and EVERY one of them are LOVABLE)-Easy-to-understand plot(The plot in this VN easy to understand, and each routes are easy to get in to. Not like the Grisaia series, or even Dies Irae in which needs us to ""think"" along with the characters to truly understand the story. You just need to go along with the flow~~~ As Rubick once said, ""Be water, my friend"")-Easy-going dialogue(The converstation and the inner thought of the protagonist's are written in the most light, and easy-going way possible, which succeed in making me burst out of laugh sometimes because the jokes really nailed it)-JUSTICE(Whaaaat? Justice? Hmm, yes, you read that right, my friend. JUSTICE! Ever read a VN where one route weight heavier than the others? Where there's heroine whom got cast aside and left as is?! Well, you won't see things like that here! EVERYONE GOT JUSTICE!!)Cons:-The length(This would've been a LOT better were it be longer, tho. I, myself, want MORE. Each heroine's routes....... MORE!!!!! I'm not one of those moe diggers out there, but I got SO ATTACHED to the characters.. hence, I DEMAND MORE!)That is all about + and - of the product.Oh, and for the side notes, in the early game, most people would probably be annoyed by D.D's (the blonde-foreigner-transfer-student heroine) accent and her written dialogues which is the true epitome of what you called ""cringe"".But, don't worry because you'll get used to it after a while... maybe.Finally, the verdict!Q: Is it worth the price?A: Oh yes, it is definitely worth the price. You won't regret buying it.Q: The length?A: An average about 3 to 4 hours per-heroine(From prologue to end), depends on how fast you read.Q: What merits do I gain if I read this?A: Waifus. 5 of them. Comes in a package.Final score: 8.1"

,Recommended,539660,31988408,Posted: 26 May,all,TTobeck15,"Chronoclock was a well made romance visual novel. It had a very interesting aspect to it with the MC having the power to go back in time a few minutes each hour. I was surprised that the ability didn't serve more during the routes of each of the girls and instead had the main aspect of time in each route. There are 6 routes within the game, 2 needing to be unlocked. The girls for each route each have their certain quirks about them that make their character and route so interesting. The art in this VN is amazing and the CGs are incredible. Even had different faces for the characters in them when there is a mood change so that was a very nice touch. The music also adds to the surrounding and tone shifts during the story and routes. Makes for a fantastic VN. So again, with 6 routes, 35-40 hours worth of content to read, and amazing art and soundtract; Chronoclock is a must read for VN lovers."

76561198370542719,Recommended,539660,30625569,Posted: 19 March,all,erogemaster,"This game is pretty okay. It's not at the level of MuvLuv Alternative or Grisaia no Kajitsu, but it's a good read if you're looking for a fun romance with a bit of story.However, it's not like it's all good. I'm afraid it has one of the worst translations I have yet to see. Quite disappointing, really.  Not like it has bad English - quite far from it, the English is actually spot-on. It's just that the translator seems to like curse words. The translator likes them to the point of curse words becoming parasitic words. And this just makes the game so much less enjoyable. Especially when you hear one thing, and the translation says something similar, but you just know it's not correct. Well, basically if you were to remove 99% of the curse words, the quality would rise by about 20%. Makes me think if it actually had proofreading/quality checking. If so, then what were PF/QC thinking?Well, that aside, you might think that not having access to all heroines (from the start) is a hassle, but there's actually a reason behind it - it would be a bit hard to follow the story should you skip a route or two.Makoto is best."

,Recommended,539660,31289114,Posted: 21 April,all,Noah615,"This is a story that I had a lot of fun with. The story itself has a lot of unused potential in it, however, that did not stop me from loving the majority, if not, all of the routes. Some are more well done than others, however, i believe there is something enjoyable for everyone in it. I read at a decent pace, so you'll most likely get around 30 hours or so out of this game. I hope they release a continuation as i believe this series has potential for an after story and such. However I think, as it is now, It's worth the price. If you are saving money, however, I would just wait to see if it drops to $20 or something around there. I got it for $24 and I don't regret It."

76561198173938506,Recommended,539660,30807985,Posted: 28 March,all,Japanese Mapping,"Basically this game is casual visual novel, however it does have some interesting characters to work with here. Although I don't like all of their features, well I guess I can say that the saying ""No one is perfect"", really does fit here. The price for this visual novel is pretty decent already for its content. However you could wait for another steam sale whenever Gaben wants to♥♥♥♥♥♥your wallet. But thats what I llike about this game. Now lets voice out my dislikes for this game, and what they can do better in the future if they wish to touch on this again. Basically please do fix some of the broken English inside this game. Secondly I personally think 6 girls ain't enough for some people which includes me. Thats pretty much it. I will give this a 8/10."

,Recommended,539660,30325370,Posted: 4 March,all,Aserdon,"I have not yet completed this game. However, the three hour prologue, let me reiterate that, three hour prologue, was enough to make me love this game so so very much. It's easily one of my favourite Visual Novels and even favourite games of all time already. I would've gladly paid full price for just the prologue and am unbeliably exicited for what's to come.If you didn't get my message from the rant above, just buy this game. Buy it. I don't care how much you have to pay for it."

,Recommended,539660,32165902,Posted: 3 June,all,SkySharkX2,"I have to say as someone new to Visual Novels this one is a really dang good one from my expirence playing it.  Its got a good balance of comedy and feels.  From the 4 main routes I've played through so far there are no truely bad/sad endings but there are a couple of routes that really hit you right in the feels at points during it.While I don't speak Japanesee the voice acting seems to be pretty well done and the Music is really catchy.  I actually found myself just listening to the background music at times when I alt tabbed to surf the internet at times.The game is also qoute lengthy, depending on how fast you read going through the entire game is likely going to take 35-40hours plus to clear so in my opinon is its definitly worht the money"
,Recommended,539660,33495938,Posted: 12 July,all,GameDrifter01,"Extremely fun and interesting especialy since each route had a gravitational story ready to yank a random chain of emotions. I highly, highly recomend if your new to visual novels or just want a really good story."
