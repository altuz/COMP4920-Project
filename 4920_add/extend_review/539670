,Recommended,539670,31694807,Posted: 11 May,all,The Angry Sakura Game Nerd™,"ok, I usually write longer and more structured reviews for the sakura games trying to be as honest as possible about the art, story, etc. but this one.... I cant write the review the same way.this is by far the most porn-filled out of the whole sakura games series if you get the uncensored patchStory? its interesting.Characters? likeable and they develop somewhatDating sim likeness? not really.Porn? you'll need the Jumbo box of tissues for this one.Also, I sure hope you like the artstyle that the sakura games uses for their... you get the point.overall, if you are buying this for the porn and want to support the winged cloud team, do it. but if you are looking for a SUPER SERIOUS DRAMA FILLED ROMANCE VISUAL NOVEL avoid all sakura games. these VNs are meant to be enjoyed and give a comedic feel like a rom/com ecchi anime, not taken as seriously as a Triple-A title."

If you want to jerk off, there's everything you need, including uncensor patch. But if you want something more than that, than it's not enough. The characters personalities are too simple and boring. I wish they were more human-like, at least Negligee-level. Sometimes I think they only have 3 emotions: fear before the next battle or during the battle, joy after battle, and the wish to thank or reward protagonist with sex after the battle. There are some eroges with well-developed characters. Just find and play, for example, Princess Trainer (Gold edition is preferred) and feel the difference."
,Recommended,539670,29105198,Posted: 7 January,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"Honestly, this isn’t the “greatest” Sakura title around. Your choices matter just a little (in order to get each girl specific ending and the harem ending), and I found the game surprisingly short (which is normal for Winged Cloud VNs, but they say on the description that the game is “twice the size, twice the action, one of Winged Cloud's biggest titles yet”… And in my honest opinion, I found it even shorter than their regular VNs. Maybe because I’ve played the Steam version without the R18 patch). The art is pretty as usual, and only three characters have VA. And… That’s it. Another fan service game with little story and a lot of boobies. Also, I was surprised to see a male sprite with an actual human face on a Sakura game, not just a shadow or a faceless doll. Hopefully they’ll add more different characters on their next releases.5/10. Get it only with a huge discount and if you want to complete your Winged Cloud collection. I don’t recommend this VN to those who wish for a deeper plot."
76561198006413390,Recommended,539670,28123175,"Posted: 1 December, 2016",all,woosk,"This 12th title of the Sakura series from Winged Cloud feature Mikage Shinzaki, Kaguya Setsuna and Arisa Moegihara who are training together at First Royal Knights Academy to eventually become full-fledged knights of the Kingdom. Under the tutelage of their instructor Reika, the trio gradually learn, practice, apply team and battle tactics on monsters and on their instructor in a dungeon underneath the Academy. The story will gain momentum and start to become more fast-paced with the appearance of hordes of monsters and undead attacking the kingdom in increasing numbers, the trio being sent on monster slaying missions to defend the kingdom, unusually aggressive spirits and the disappearance of Mikage's foster father Zero Shinzaki. Over the course of the story, Mikage, Kaguya and Arisa will interact with each other, Reika, Zero, Jin Setsuna(Kaguya's father and Zero's adjutant), Arisa's siblings, a slime monster, a Roper monster, a Minotaur, a goblin horde, a water sprite, a demoness and a dragon.The story and plot is written like a romantic comedy with a share of humour and fanservice and has 3 nice happy endings, the background music is great and overall presentation is also nicely done.Reading through the storyline and dialogue, unlocking all CGs at gallery and obtaining all achievements will take less than 10 hours."
,Recommended,539670,26181836,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,Glaicer,"Just finished game lately (18+ version). Seem so, nope-- actually IS Winged Cloud went full nukige-mode here! Pros: hentai scenes feels deeper, more exciting and hornier than ever; duration become longer for sure. Cons: anything else about story, narrative details, characterization (more or less) are doomed. So, please don't buy this if you are looking for plot-driven novel.Personally i like this Sakura novel. Wanaca and lovely seiyuu did a really great job to drive pleasure over the edge but... game is't that large as advertised. Basically, all three routes combined are sliiiightly longer than Swim Club. By hour or two. Depends. Looking back at base price... i am bit frustrated.Recommended to Sakura addicts, must have for Wanaca fans (join FC now!) and plan to for nukige apprentices."

,Recommended,539670,30365139,Posted: 6 March,all,Eurypema,"From a Sakura perspective, this is one of the better VNs in the Sakura repitoire. The voice acting is goodand the H-scenes are gratuitous, given one downloads the R-18 patch. However, with that being said, this is still an inferior product to Sakura Fantasy. While thehentai scenesare certainly more abundant, the plot, assuming people actually play Sakura games unironically for the plot, is certainly inferior, and ends up making the game feel redundant and somewhat monotonous. More irritatingly is the re-using of CGs, which feels lazy. Mind you, this does not occur often, but if Winged Cloud is going to sell Nova at a price higher than other Sakura games, I would expect more effort and quality on their part. Overall, the game is, in the end, simply another Sakura game, and aside from theanime♥♥♥♥♥♥should not be taken as seriously as any non-adult VN. But, if you haven't played Sakura Fantasy, get that instead. It's better."

This patch is the holy grail of Hentai.  This may go down as one of the hardest core $%^# on steam.  In terms of fan service this game is the best.This game also has achievements and 3 different endings (though I only played through the threesome ending, you can also get both girls individually.)Sakura Fantasy chapter 1 is still the best in terms of story telling.  Don't run into this and expect an outstanding tale.Better than Sakura Swim Club and Sakura Space, but under Sakura Fantasy chapter 1."
,Not Recommended,539670,26280412,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,Catsim,"When porn is free all over erotic VNs have to offer a compelling story between their H-scenes. Good VNs let you fall in love with the girls so you care about them and can't wait to get to the H-scenes. Sakura Nova gives you a story for a few scenes then gives up and just has the girl say ""wanna do it?"" out of nowhere so it just feels as shallow as finding all the CG on the internet for free. You can literally see the point where the writer got tired of writing dialogue and just skipped straight to the H-scene. Besides that the story is quite simple and doesn't really go anywhere."

You play as a knight who discovers that your new squadmates are a pair of beautiful girls. Through the course of the game, you learn to fight together, defeat many monsters... and have relations with both, before choosing whether to settle down with one or both of them. The achievements are easy to acquire (just do all three routes, and at least once just skip all messages). And the trading cards are nice to look at.There is a free patch that adds more explicit content, but I am unsure how much it really adds to the story."

Unlike other Sakura Games (those I have on my list) there are no voice acting and that makes the game a lot more fun, hopefully they continue with that in the future!And the choices you have to make in some areas gives you somewhat different outcome, though I wish there was more areas you could actually choose different daiologs in. It's pretty lacking but it's still fun.And who doesn't like Achievements and Steam trading Cards huh?!More story in this than I imagined, pretty cliché though but it does the job and sometimes cliché is just fun, relaxing.And speaking of relaxing..Would fap again 10/10!"
