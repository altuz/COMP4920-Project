,Recommended,539720,29050492,Posted: 5 January,all,Kovic,"- Its cheap- The achievements are not super difficult, but getting to level 10 can be a bit tricky- Each vehicle appears to have a slightly different powerup available as well as color scheme for the gameplay- The levels are randomly generated so it keeps things fresh, but at the same time this makes it so memorizing the levels is impossible.  ;)- Fuel is very important, so don't be afraid to drive slowly to make sure you have time to react to grab fuel.I recommend this one, it may not take you long to get all the cars and achievements if you're really good or a little bit lucky.One BIG Warning though... after about 15 minutes of playing this game my eyes were tripping out, so I recommend not playing this for extended periods of time if your eyes are sensitive to flashing and moving bright lights."

,Recommended,539720,32578833,Posted: 19 June,all,gyashaa,"Pros:- Looks good- Great music- Decent Gameplay (not great, but not bad)Cons:- DifficultThe problems:- You can't see very far ahead so you don't have much time to react. An option to change field of view would be nice.- On top of the little reaction time, the car turns very slowly. This makes it difficult and sometimes even impossible to grab items or get out of the way of other vehicles. An option to change turning speed and an option to turn with the mouse would be great.- Menu options are unclear with just symbols instead of words or abbreviations- Menu options counterintuitive. e.g. pressing escape pauses the game but pressing escape again doesn't unpause the game, it brings you back to the main menu and erases any progress you have made, without any warning. Wtf.- Needs options to change volume of music and sfx- Could just be me but I feel like in the later levers (5 and up) you lose gas too quickly. I also think you should lose gas slower when not using the accelerator.- The buffs (speed boost, invulnerability, slow down) don't last very longExtras ideas:- Would love to be able to reverse (to grab a buff or gas that I missed). Technically you 'can' but you can only go reeeeeeeeeally slow. Also, you're quickly and constantly losing gas so pretty much you WILL lose all of your gas (and the game) before you ever reach the item.- The only difference between the unlockable cars is how they look (which isn't ""bad""), but maybe you can have the different cars have different strengths and weaknesses. i.e. one car drives super fast, another car turns fast, another is slow but can recover more easily when hitting another car, etc. So many possibilities.- Could use more variety of buffs. Extra lives, extra score points, temporary infinite gas, etcOverall, it's a pretty decent casual/arcade game. I recommend it if you're into 80s music and visuals.And to the devs, thank you for putting the soundtrack up for download. I was actually going to request it before it was up. :)"

I'm not that good at this yet, but past level 7 it begins to get tough as the computer cars change up their patterns.This game does require quick thinking and reaction. Its great if you're a keyboard gamer and like old school emulation. Electronic soundtrack is pretty fitting for it.Nice job."

Objective is simple just like in Road Fighter - drive forward, get fuel and dodge other cars. Few minor bugs (especially when you are driving way too slow this can cause to spawn huge amount of cars at once). Graphics and music are great aswell (retro). My rating for this game is 9/10. Definitely recommended even for full 1$ price."

,Recommended,539720,26098614,"Posted: 18 October, 2016",all,SixHealthOfFury,"Update: Devs made a stealth patch (unannounced) and the top scrolling speed was slowed down to give players a full second to react to finding fuel stations. Makes it truer to being a casual high score racing game as advertised and actually fun to play. Still has low replay value, but it is worth buying for the soundtrack alone, now that it is included at the base price.Original Review:It's more of a rage game than casual. Imagine going at the speed of sound and seeing enough of the screen ahead of you to make a 0.3 second reaction. The fuel is a timer, not measured off speed which isn't a bad thing, just something to be weary of considering the gas stations aren't frequent and they can sometimes spawn in areas  the player can't reach. Combined with the short reaction time, the gas stations are frequent panic attacks than sighs of relief.It does fit the bill as a simple racing game and mimics arcade classics, so it isn't terrible. It isn't good and due to not needing much skill to do well in it, lowers the replay value by quite a bit.For Achievement Hunters only: 3/10"

This is a cheap & easy game to 100%.  It may take about half an hour to collect the first 8 achievements.  They unlock as you accumulate more and more miles on the track.  The 9th achievement is a little harder since you will have to be savvy with how the game works and be able to get to level 10.  It took me about 1 hour to do this for a total of 1.5 hours to 100% it.  However, there are 5 cards to unlock while playing and it may take 2.5-3 hours to unlock all 5 cards.  Definitely get this if you're trying to up your achievement stats."
76561197971341065,Not Recommended,539720,29554468,Posted: 28 January,all,sfnhltb,"A top down racing game where you have to avoid crashing into the walls (and if going more than medium pace, cars which spin you into walls if you hit them) and run over the petrol pumps to extend your timer - while it seems like it should be a fuel gauge, it goes down at the same speed whether you are going top speed or crawling along at a snails pace, so functionally it is a timer. This gives the odd situation that if you are running low on ""fuel"" you have to nail the accelerator in the hope you make it to the next fuel station in time.The early levels (1-4) play quite well, you can go flat out in light traffic, and the challenge of hitting at least every third or so fuel pump while also avoiding cars makes for quite a good balance. This all starts to fall apart from the 5th level with the combination of regular narrow 2 lane sections that make it impossible not to slow down to a much more sedate pace, plus a new type of car in the traffic that bounces from wall to wall, which are bad enough to deal with in the full width sections, but basically make going any faster than about 150 suicidal from that point on.If you can make it pootling along to level 10-11 it then gets worse, as you end up stuck on an almost continuously 2 narrow lane setup, which briefly widens regularly but no usually long enough to overtake anything. Meanwhile a mass of purple cars that all go the same speed and move to block you appear and quickly there are dozens of them making it impossible to do anything but chug along behind them at a tepid pace.Overall I can't really recommend this, if the difficulty of the traffic ramped up slowly following the patterns at the beginning of the game it could have been fairly decent, but everything after that is poor and gets worse. Also this game randomly appeared in my games list a few weeks back, and I have no idea why - was it meant to be a free review copy, not sure."
