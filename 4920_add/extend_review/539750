,Recommended,539750,26065235,"Posted: 16 October, 2016",all,Xurunomus,"Pros:- Interesting puzzle mechanic- small price- trading cardsCons:- not much of levels (only 50) and first 20 of them are elementary, so you have only 30 to solve which provide at least bit of complexity- reiterative: you have mirror areas on the same level with exactly the same placement of blocks, which forces you to repeat the same solution twice or thrice.- timed puzzles the same as you already solved in ""normal mode"". Don't really see any reason to repeat them again, especially when so much time given. Different puzzles specially constructed for timed mode with very little time given would have been interesting, otherwise it's pointless.As the side note: there are no text description or tutorial of what to do in game. Well, it's not hard to figure out by practice but someone may find it confusing at least at the beginning."

Cheap.It has nothing I would call 'tutorial', but it's easy enough to figure out.A major downside is that it has no windowed mode. No replayability.All in all, I don't regret buying it."

First 10-15 levels are easy, and then the fun begins. The mechanics you need to figure out for yourself, I believe it's intended as part of the experience. Good little game at very affordable price, with a couple of hours entertainment value."

Time trial is a joke, it's just about remembering how to solve each level and executing the clicks as fast as you can.I'd give a neutral rating because the game isn't bad. It's just not interesting."
,Not Recommended,539750,31378676,Posted: 26 April,all,Fazer [PL],"The mechanics are confusing at the beginning, but can be summed up as:1 + 1 + 1 = 22 + 2 + 2 = 33 + 3 + 3 = 4and so on.The graphics are simplistic, the music slightly depressing and the sounds don't give enjoyable feedback.But it you can get past that it's an alright puzzle game for that price."

76561198355036865,Not Recommended,539750,33584437,Posted: 16 July,all,SealieP,"I'm disappointed.  First of all you can't change to a windowed mode.  Alt-enter will give you a window but the game doesn't resize so it's unplayable like that.  Highly annoying.  Second, there are two modes, your basic levels and they unlock the timed trials.  Sounds like a lot of puzzles.  Nope.  Same ones.  To make it seem like there are more puzzles the dev duplicated the original levels to make a new mode allowing you to time yourself.  Why couldn't that be in the basic leveling mode?  If the puzzles were different and you had to complete them under a certain time frame, then okay.  But the same ones and only seeing what you time is to beat yourself is bogus as a separate mode.As a puzzler, it's okay.  I'm not hating it as much as some others I've played, but it's not really oodles fun either.  I'll finish it off and it won't be a chore, but not something I'm looking forward to either.  Graphics are a bit too crazy and annoying.  I've just turned the sound completely off.  If you really want it, get it on sale for at least half off.  Then you don't hate yourself as much for getting it."

I can get down to solving and resolving the puzzles without feeling quite so ill.Still a few flaws, faster response times would be nice and faster level restart (mainly for the timed games), windowed mode would still be preferable, etc, but all in all the puzzle is fairly unique, deceptively tricky, and well worth the small cost."
,Recommended,539750,29120556,Posted: 8 January,all,El Doragusa,"This game has an okay concept. At first it is quite fun, but it becomes horribly repetitive, with big parts of one level being the same, which just ends up making i boring.#EDITThings I would like to see changed:- Make it possible to remove single cells that you have have, because it is terribly annoying having to start all the way over, just because you misclicked.- Don't make levels consist of the same puzzle twice or even four times.- Some levels are interesting and presents new challenges ( e.g. 42, 32 ), while others are just repetitive."

It can be a bit tricky at first, but you eventually learn some tricks to maneuvering around levels efficiently.  Time trial achievements can be intimidating at first, but you'll learn that you actually have plenty of time to work with."

,Not Recommended,539750,33553919,Posted: 15 July,all,Idunhaël,"Didn't like this game enough to keep it. Graphics are too childlike for my tastes, and overall gameplay/puzzles too simple. Feels like a mobile game made for children."
,Recommended,539750,26039556,"Posted: 14 October, 2016",all,Gaming Authoritah,"Took me a minute to get the hang of it, but the game delivers exactly what it says. It's a puzzle game where you click on squares to combine them. You then combine neighboring squares. Those resulting squares eventually combine into higher and higher tiles.  The video helps explain it further.See the gameplayhttps://youtu.be/c6NNPyxlEfc"

,Recommended,539750,29749290,Posted: 6 February,all,Darque Flux,It's a good game but could use a lot better visual feedback over what you can and cannot do. and possibly even some text in the starter levels.
,Recommended,539750,31499030,Posted: 1 May,all,Chèrel,Could use some sort of in-game explaination as to what's going on but once you get the hang of it it's a pretty fun and satisfying little puzzle game.
