I very much understand that a local game coop this cheap it a plus for some peoples. If this is your case, this game might be cool for you.But, for me, it isn't. I'm not somebody who will mind paying for my game. Playing this game was very disapointing because my expectations were too high. But truth be told, I can't see a moment where I'll play this with my friends over any of my other games.On a side note, the devs contacted me about my review and were very friendly. Huge props to them.--------------------------------------------------------------------------If you want it, here is the old review, in all it's salty glory.--------------------------------------------------------------------------When I started playing this, it reminded me of Rogue Legacy because of the way the Knight was hitting his sword and the platformer levels.But don't be fooled, beyond the goal of each game, both have some big differences.In Rogue Legacy, the gameplay is fast and engaging, the ennemies are interesting and the hitboxes are clear and accurate.In this, you hit slow wlaking mobs, without any difference but their hit points, until you get so bored you let your character die.Oh and it's coop, so you can bore your friends too."
,Recommended,540100,31359468,Posted: 25 April,all,Magrudergrind,"Imprisioned light is a indie title developed and published by imaginite Ltd.Your main goal in the game is to light up crystals, using souls.You start out with one of several different characters, and basicly kill monsters coming down at you, in a closed enviroment with some platforming elements, collecting their souls to help light up crystals. Sounds easy enough? It isnt.At start its pretty slow paced and feels really easy. Enemies are slow and pretty weak. A good way to get into the game, but once you get to higher levels the monsters comes faster at you in bigger numbers, and are much stronger making it much more hectic and fastpaced.If the monsters gets to close to the crystals they take damage and you will have to refill it with more souls and if one of them gets destroyed, you will die.Once you refilled the crystal/crystals, you advance to the next level.By filling crystals with souls you also level up your character, and can choose between strength, health, magic and speed.The characters are interesting enough and have some fun special abilites to play around with.For the cheap price tag i warmly recommend this game if you have some friends to play with. Single player is ok but coop is where it really shines!Pros:- Easy to learn, hard to master- Simple controls and smooth enough gameplay- Different classes to choose from with different abilities- Online coop was recently implemented- Retro graphicsCons:- Multiplayer bugs. Although, the devs are aware of this and constantly updates the game so it might be stable now.- Can be a bit repetetive and grindy. Not a big problem for me though.Overall i give it a warm 7/10"
,Recommended,540100,32437272,Posted: 15 June,all,malaisling,"A nice old style game with solid retro art, music and simple combat. With the addition of environmental hazards, acquirable projectiles, a special ability and power ups to help make the gameplay more interesting.There is however no way for players to regulate their jump height, which can make it very difficult to jump without getting hurt if there is something dangerous above the player. Leading to awkward and unavoidable damage exchanges when fighting. The progression of the game also feels very imbalanced. Each map includes ten stages, most of which do not become difficult until near the latter range of those. Thus players will spend a lot of time, at least during the earlier maps, basically grinding while waiting for the real challenge to arrive. And should players fail, their progress is completely reset and they must play through it all again anytime they fail or start a new game.While the game is well designed and very well rounded in terms of its old style, the awkward difficulty scaling and length of each map type does detract from the overall experience even when playing the game for the second time. It would benefit greatly from the amount of stages per map being halved, but having the difficulty heightened to be at least moderately challenging at all times.Regardless, for such a low price it is well worth it. Especially if it is only played once in awhile."

SPOILE!R! that killing cloud at the 3rd location is a kind of sniper ;)Verdict:Would buy it again, even with higher price.

I, personally, would even pay a little more for it.-It's a fun little Hack n' Slash survival where you have to guard and regenerate crystals.--Me and my friends personally think local co-op is harder because we have to fight over experience and when someone dies we have to donate souls to the dead ones, which is totally fine and cool that they can come back alive.--Solo I enjoy, because you can get through levels pretty better than co-op, and 3+ crystals are a challenge, which I Enjoy. (at least to me, but hey you do you Mr. Pro).-Has controller support, and as a console gamer, I thank you for adding this.-I can't wait to see what else this game has in stored for the future."

,Recommended,540100,30816147,Posted: 29 March,all,Allen,"Ok, I must say, for the price of this game, it's really awesome!  Even if the price was a little higher, it would still be worth buying!  It's basically a rogue-like in a fantasy medieval setting.  Chose a class out of several:   Knight, Warrior, Necromancer, Wizard, Ranger.  Slay monsters, collect their souls, level up and increase your ability stats, use special powers, replenish dying soul crystals and once you have completely replenished the crystals with souls, you move onto the next area and do the same!  I have not hit any level limit yet so I don't know how high you can go!  No crazy brain busting puzzles to burn out on - just hack your way through!   Not only that, but you can do it with up to 3 other friends cooperatively!  Hosting, joining, and inviting friends to a game could not be any easier!  For the price, you can't go wrong! Buy this game now and buy it for your friends too!"

,Recommended,540100,26273817,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,Mel,"edit: They added a 'how to play' in the menu and seem to be updating the game frequently. Good devs._______________________________A fun little arcade/RPG-lite game for 1-4 players. Pleasant retro graphics/animations/sound. The mechanics all work well and the 4 characters play fairly differently- they aren't just color swaps. It's VERY light on options (sound only, no resolution options or anything- though alt+enter works for fullscreen). It's also very light on direction, but it's not too hard to figure out as you go.Gameplay only video (recorded before I understood the 'protect the crystal' goal lol):https://youtu.be/FUBzexCbt2EWhile it's nothing revolutionary, if you like the genre and/or quickie ""cheap games to enjoy for a few hours"", this is a good choice. For the price? Definitely recommended, especially on sale."
76561198260017007,Recommended,540100,31495221,Posted: 1 May,all,kirbykips,"This game is really fun, especially on multiplayer; however, there are some big flaws.To sum up:Pros:Fun MultiplayerDifferent characters to choose from with different powersGood musicInteresting ArtCons:Characters are unbalancedXP Gain unbalancedPlayer is not well informedYou have a choice of 5 characters, each with their own stats and unique powers that make them all special.  The leveling up system is sort of weighted depending on your chosen character.  The Knight tends to grow in levels much faster than any of the other characters, which makes it really easy to get higher stats early in the game.  However, you're on a timer and your greatest source of xp is from giving your souls to the crystal, which gets filled up quickly and is normally just one per stage.This system is SEVERELY flawed in multiplayer.Xp is hard to get in multiplayer.  The greatest and fastest method of getting xp is by dumping souls into the one crystal you have each level.  On your own, it fills up pretty quick; however, when you're sharing it with friends, you'll hardly get anything.Also, the Knight is overpowered.  He levels up twice as fast as any other character you can choose from.  At around World 3, the Knight will be level 25 and other characters will be at level 10 at the least.In multiplayer, only one person can be each character, so only one can be the knight.  Either the XP gain should be nerfed on the Knight, or fixed on the other characters.Another thing is that the rules and mechanics of the game are not explained very well.  Although the basics of how to play are explained in a ""How to Play"" section, there are MANY things the game doesn't tell you.  For example, on single player at world 3, a rain cloud appears randomly on different levels.  This doesn't appear in multiplayer.  You would think it's part of the world, but it actually can hurt or kill you if it strikes you with its lightning.  The game makes no mention of this.There are also various potions that appear, some with good or bad effects.  Again, never mentioned.  The details on stats are never totally explained, like how magic can expand your capacity to carry souls or how your special attack consumes souls to be activated and how long it lasts.Lastly, the collectables that appear from time to time are not that helpful when fighting monsters.Even though it sounds like a bad game, it's still completely addicting.  The art on the monsters and characters are interesting and the music isn't bad either.  I also love playing multiplayer.  It's fun to fight together with your close friends to the deepest parts of Hell...literally."

However, if you are looking for a little indie gem to spend a few hours with that features local co-op and online multiplayer to play with friends, it's pretty damn entertaining. I mean, for $2...

The only drawbacks i have found are the randomized spawning of thrown weapons even after unlocking them all, the near-uselessness of player skills and the ability for enemies to fall directly on a crystal leaving you sometimes only a split second to kill them between their spawning and the crystal(s). All in all i'd reccomend this to any and all fans of patformers and rogue-like games alike."
,Recommended,540100,30684261,Posted: 23 March,all,Xinister,"Imprisoned lightSo far I have spent 2 hours in this game and I can say without a doubt, this is a damn good game, tons of fun especially with a friend or 2.The goal of the game is rather simple collect souls and power up the crystals and save the kingdom.You can choose between 5 different characters each with their own unique skill and starter stats.GraphicsNice retro graphics, with some pretty good lighting effectsSoundWell the fighting sounds are good pretty standard but they are good, also the in game music is pretty good.GameplayStandard platforming with some rpg elements (leveling up your character and stats) each time you level up you gain 1 stat point.The EndOverall I would say for 2 euro or currently on sale 1.39 euro you get a lot of gameplay and not getting this game would be a mistake, since it is a ton of fun. In the begining it might look easy, but as you advance the diffculty increases.A little neat feature I forgot to mention is if a light crystal gets corrupted a demon will appear and turn on of your team mates into a demon, which you of course will have to kill, but be cautios this demon is stronger than any of the other monters in the game.Also if a team mate should fall remember to give your dead team mate souls to revive him or her, missing a team mate could result in your team failing the level you are in.So what are you waiting for? GO GET THE GAME!A little thing I do have to mention though multiplayer (online) can be buggy at times for some people, but compared to how it was before it has improved."

,Recommended,540100,33376281,Posted: 8 July,all,JeanH13,"This is an enjoyable, casual game. I find it is best played in short bursts when one is wanting to take a short break from other tasks (chores, work, etc.).It supports online multiplayer and local multiplayer (up to 4 for either), and is best enjoyed with friends. It is a cooperative screen-defense game with rogue-light progression and minor competition (someone becomes a demon if you take too long to beat a level).The gameplay itself is best compared to ""Super Mario Bros. 3: Battle Mode"" from the SNES. Add in a crystal that you have to power up (as a team, or solo) to advance to the next stage, and you have this game described in a nutshell. If you don't like that style of game, then you likely won't like this.I picked it up during a sale, but I do think the USD price is justified. The base game itself is fun in a casual-setting, but replayability at the moment is small once you manage to clear the last ""world"". There are five worlds, and what feels like ten levels within a world before being advanced to the next world."

The core gameplay is way too simple.The combat and enemy design are at a bare minimum in terms of complexity.All of the 18 enemy types have the same attacks and AI, they either walk towards you, or they fly towards youI get that the game wants to be simple, but at some point simplicity just becomes boring.2. The game is too easyThe first 20 minutes of the game offer no signifigant challenge what so ever.This would not be a problem if you only had to play through it once but.....3. The permadeath.Why, why, why does this game have permadeath?There is no random generationThe levels are long and samy and there is no signifigant unlocks to make you wanna replay the same levels again.The game would be much better off with a level selector or a lives system.I think the devs wanted to make a rouge-like experience, and that is fine, but it does not fit this game at all."

It is probably best for short breaks. I wasn't able to play the game for a long time because there was only one keyboard-layout which used the z key. With a non-US keyboard, you were not really able to play the game. The dev, however, added a second key-layout which made it able for me to play it. Thats nice!What i like:- The drawing / pixel art is nice- Sound is good- Easy to understand and play- It is veeery cheapWhat i don't like:- It's a bit of a ""highscore"" game. It's quite pointless, you are doing the same thing all the time with increasing difficulty. Not my personal flavor to be honest, but then again, it was 1$ or so.I did not try the multiplayer, but local co-op may be a lot funnier than solo play.Can recommend it for people who like short and simple games, good for a break"

It fits the game very well and for it being the only song I have encountered so far, its actually not annoying after awhile. Its a pretty good tune.The gameplay itself is a little bit confusing as there is no tutorial in-game. You can see me have a hard time with this in the video. Eventually you can figure out that the main goal is to gather souls from enemies you kill and give them to the crystal in the center of the room. The crystal if not given souls will slowly run out of ""health."" Also in order to get to the next stage, you must power up the crystal enough.The classes in the game are very cool. I enjoyed the design of each of them. The Necromancer was my favorite design so far.I personally have not got far enough into the game to tell which class is really better for what. So I cant make a review on that. I might in the future.Overall, the game is very fun in the 15 minutes I played. The game is cheap as well.
