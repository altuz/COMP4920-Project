,Recommended,540510,26676480,"Posted: 18 November, 2016",all,[slckr]robilar5500,"ISLANDS: Non-Places, Transcendent MundanityI saw ISLANDS: Non-Places on Steam yesterday, and seeing as how I'm always in the market for a new gaming experience, I thought I would go ahead and grab it, see what it had to offer. I'm glad I did. Initially, my thoughts were that the game looked really cool and was quite bizarre. After playing through it, my first reaction was, ""what did I just witness?"" Upon further reflection however, I realized that ISLANDS: Non-Places carried an almost intricate and yet surprisingly delicate sense of depth. So, without further ado, let's get to the meat of this game review.StoryThe story in ISLANDS: Non-Places isn't really a story told, but rather a sensibility conveyed. It goes into great detail, both visually and audibly, allowing the player a glimpse at what could lie underneath seemingly mundane places and circumstances. For example, one of the puzzles begins with an idyllic fountain. As you explore underneath the fountain, you start to see all the moving pieces and natural interactions that make the fountain what it is. Not only the mechanics of it, but also the natural interactions of dirt, tree roots, and so on. So, while there isn't an actual story per se, the depth of experience bears witness to a more transcendental, subjective tale. Essentially, it is meant to convey an evocative if brief moment of reflection and introspection9 out of 10GameplayThe gameplay in ISLANDS: Non-Places is simply a means to an end. At its core, ISLANDS: Non-Places is a casual puzzle game. What you realize early on however, is that this is a game about experience rather than challenge. You are simply guiding the game along its chosen path.This is accomplished by simply clicking on anomalies in the little islands of mundanity provided. These take the form of either flickering lights or moving objects. After clicking on the requisite item or items, it unlocks the next link in the chain of events you are to witness.Despite its very casual and simplistic nature, the gameplay in ISLANDS: Non-Places is the very definition of perfection for what it has set out to accomplish.Rather than get in the way, it seamlessly guides you through your 45 minute or so journey.10 out of 10GraphicsGraphics in ISLANDS: Non-Places are a featured device for conveying the atmospheric little ecosystems that breathe life into each mundane scenario. This is truly a beautiful game. While functional and minimalist to an extent, the moments that highlight the inner life of simple things like a drink cooler or a cafe patio are both compelling and evocative. You can feel the intricacy of a delicate and sublime, typically unseen other world that helps to create a synchronicity between the visual and audio experience in this game.8.5 out of 10AudioIt is recommended that you wear a headset when you play ISLANDS: Non-Places so as to get the maximum benefit of the subtleties in sound offered in this game. However, they arent required, and I played through half the game without just be sure of this. Like the graphics, the audio serves to take the player to a world within the world, where, upon witnessing the grandeur of a simple bus stop, you have no choice but to ponder the relevance and meaning of existence beyond what our overt senses tell us. To that effect, the audio in this game is really the star. While always present, it doesn't burden you in any way and really instead helps to create a fully immersive experience.8.5 out of 10VerdictWhile ISLANDS: Non-Places wont be a game that everybody appreciates, for those of you who enjoy a more subtle and fulfilling, if short experience, I can easily recommend this game. There are ten little islands of mundanity in this game, but their transcendent nature will keep you thinking about this game long after you finish it. That said, once you finish you can also replay any level you want at any time, and this is something I would actually also recommend as you will find yourself noticing things you may have missed on your first play through.A solid 9 visions of transcendental awareness through mundane situations out of 10 possible. Very zen."
,Recommended,540510,31742854,Posted: 14 May,all,vonblubba 🍺,"This is not a game, so if you're looking for puzzles to solve, look somewhere else.This is more like watching a virtual art exhibit; interaction is minimal (click where it's blinking or little more than that). It's a series of surreal environments where strange things happen as you click around, and I mean strange in a good, oniric way. Sounds and visuals merge beautifully into a mesmerizing experience.As with all works of art, it's a very personal experience, so there's no way to know if you'll like it until you try it. My suggestion is, do try it, especially now that its price tag is 99 cents. Even if it's only to help out someone who's trying to do something different, and god knows if we need people like that."

Every image was brief, but illustrious, overflowing with colours, like a ROYGBIV eclair that I couldn't bite into.It was the Tomy Racing Turbo.The invitation to my eyes was received and I was fortunate enough to get one, thanks to the generosity of my parents. I put aside an entire night for it; it was going to be glorious. The lighting was soporific in my room and I prepared myself, mentally and physically, for a marathon joy-festival.And then I played it. In under an hour, all of my visions of grandeur and joy; pomp and circumstance; elation and hypersensitivty were disrupted by inexcusable hyperbole and unforgivable brevity. For a short moment, yes, it was everything I had hoped; and I applauded and lauded the creator for bringing it to me.After? I realized that feeling, that sensation and expectation I had would never come to fruition.It's a really pretty interactive screensaver with some great bits of ASMR. If that's what you want, enjoy. Beyond that, it's nothing different from the trailer you see above - really.tl;dr -- Watch the trailer, turn up the sound, save your money.Cheers."

The goal is to find something flashing and click on it, which triggers something else to start flashing.  This game mechanic puts it well behind such luminaries as Cookie Clicker or NOTEPAD.EXE.But that's not the point. This is an interactive art exhibit, and if I'm any judge, a really pretty one. It is cheap and interesting and beautiful. The only negative I have is that the user interface is extremely sparse. Use the gamepad to rotate, but only on one axis. Use the mouse that looks like a WAIT pointer to click on things. You get out by pressing ESC. When you exit, you appear to save your progress. I don't know if there's a way to reset your progress.  All the levels are short and don't necessarily follow or flow anyway, so there's probably no need for this.Oh, one more negative: Why can't I use this as a screensaver!"

Rotate micro-environments, activate the glowing bits, wait, listen and observe.It is a bit trippy, mostly zen, deliberately slow-paced, extremely short, minimally interactive, entirely linear, and can be enjoyed for its art style and ambiance. Must absolutely be played with headphones.The game's main problem is its lack of immediate feedback. Correct clicks often produce a delayed response and so figuring out what to do is extremely easy but rarely satisfying.That there is no real logic to the set pieces or connections between them is not really an issue, although a suggested narrative would make the experience more cohesive. A few really good ideas, some of them more intriguing than others, but none of them produce any unexpected surprise.I actually really looked forward to play this game but I expected to enjoy it a lot more than I actually did.

Worth it. It was a great little 45 minute trip, which was the perfect amout of time for the installation.There's no running, no jumping, just a little circling and a little clicking. It is very short, there's no replay value, no challenge, and no skill required at all. In fact, there are a lot of people who wouldn't even call this a ""game."" I can't call that negitive, though. It's a series of brief interactive experiences. It's like being able to play with some wierd kenetic sculpture installation at a virtual modern art museum. Use headphones. It's not like you're going to hunt down the soundtrack and pop those tunes on at the gym, oh hells no. It's just that the ambient sound design really enhances the feelings of immersion and disorientation.You'll probably only ever play it once, but it worth it the next time you need to wait for something else to install.Also, for the first and (most likely only) time you play it, if you happen to have access to a quality dispensary, I highly recommended making a quick stop there, first.EDIT: I hadn't read any other reviews before writing this, and I just read a bunch right after I posted. The one thing that comes up, over and over (besides ""not a game"") is reviewers comparing it to an art exibit, or a series of sculptures, it's not just me after all. When you get a bunch of unconnected people say the same thing about something, that's pretty telling about what your experience would be like, as well.

No story, no gameplay, it didn't affect me at all, apart from making me feel bored. Seriously, someone gave it a 10 out of 10 in Gameplay...

It's just click the stuff that blinks and hear noises you could hear by walking outside. Want a surreal experience like this but just in real life? All you needs to do is enter a depressing office building with a horrible interior decorator. If I had to give this a rating, it'd be 1/10.

The sound in this game is also very nice, it gave some of the islands an eerie feel I really enjoyed. If I had to complain about one thing it would be the games length, I was able to finish all of it in under 40 minutes which is pretty short for the games price. Overall I definitely recommend this game, especially if it's on sale!"

However, it seems more like an interactive art piece than a game, so much; I feel like it's designed to be savored like a poem, not driven through like a fast-paced novel.I'll probably replay a level every now and then when I feel like it, although after the initial surprise has been used up, some of the levels lose their interest. (The fountain and the bus stop come to mind, in particular.) Others are fun enough to watch on their own that I could see revisiting them. The parking lot was definitely my favorite."

The mysterious setting and art is good. I didn't like how there is nothing you can do differently than the only choice they give you at every part of the game."

First and foremost, you should not go into this expecting a game proper, but rather a showcase of minimalistic aesthetic in the game. This is not for everyone, as you need to have an appreciation for the art style, which fortunately for me, I absolutely adore. While It is no doubt a beautiful game, there are a few complaints I feel need to be addressed. The first complaint would be about the spots you need to click, or hit boxes, for lack of a better term, can be way too small to get in one click, the worst offender of this is the part with the suitcases. My only other complaint is that it isway too short. I would absolutely like to explore more environments like the ones in game. Overall, if you have patience, 45 minutes to kill, and appreciation for minimalist aesthetics, this is the game for you."

,Recommended,540510,31699392,Posted: 12 May,all,A Pocketful of Stars,"+ Creative+ Atmospheric- Annoying sounds- (Arguably) too short for the priceThis is exactly what it looks like: a game where you look at things, poke them, and then watch what happens. It's linear, with each small vignette playing out a set narrative and then disappearing. Sometimes the game really worked for me; the dev has a great imagination, and the liminal spaces on display (parking lots, ATMs, fountains) are explored in delightful ways that blend the mechanical with the organic.One downside is that the environments feel fixed. You can't look up or down, just rotate the scenery. Your impact on each scene is quite limited; it isn't always clear whether your clicking is the reason you've moved on to the next ""stage"" of a level or if it's just timed. I used my laptop's touchscreen, which was definitely more immersive than just clicking around, but interaction still felt constained at times and the objects weren't that responsive to touch. The game is missing that tactile feeling you get from similar games like Windosill or Metamorphabet, where you can click, drag, and relocate almost anything onscreen.The sound design is also an issue. Almost everything makes some sort of electronic noise, but the developer seems to have overlooked the fact that the sounds of alarms, telephones and sirens were deliberately designed to be as grating as possible. The racket can disturb the zen feeling the game is going for―at times I rushed through a level just to get the damn ringing to stop.I don't think the hour or so of gameplay will be worth the price for most people, but if it's on sale then people who enjoy surreal, casual art games should take a look."
,Not Recommended,540510,31776311,Posted: 15 May,all,Jean-Arnhem,"A series of surreal interactive landscapes - not really a game.This game doesn't so much have a narrative as a series of interlocking puzzle landscapes. It's pretty enough for an indie title, although I'm halfway through in under an hour. Replayability is also not really a thing; there seems to be no difference in results based on how you interact with the landscapes. It succeeds as an experimental and atmospheric experience, but not so much as a game in itself. It went on sale for $1, although I'd say an apt price tag would be $2.99, reminiscent of packs of screen savers sold for early Windows versions."

It is a very conceptual game you may find on mobile / web platforms ala ZenBound, and the gameplay here is rotation of environments  (or objects... an entire lounge which has an impressive flooding sequence, or a fridge which spews its contents into a light pattern you have to click on...) you are completely restricted to rotating objects and clicking on parts of them, meters, lights, etc... to trigger the next animation / level change / cutscene into happening. There is no story, instead you are observing ambient scenes with surreal effects. The game did begin to wear thin about halfway through its levels, as I found it to begin to feel a bit tedious/repetitive, but I really enjoyed the first 5 episodes or levels / scenes that I watched, the flooding lounge area being my favorite of what I saw.That being said, its replay value is quite low and its initial presentation is fairly abstract with very minimalistic gameplay (no story, ""rotating and click"") which may turn off some of its appeal. What I have played of it is well-done and immersive."

,Not Recommended,540510,34282007,Posted: 16 August,all,Nik,"I'm really bummed to give this game a thumbs-down, because I like the artist so much and was really looking forward to this release. Leaving those expectations aside, Islands underachives on pretty much all levels.The gameplay is boring and repetitive. It's a bit Homer Simpsons-esque... click on the glowing thing, watch the object go up, click it again, thing goes down. Do this a few times, and then you finish the scene. I could easily see how a little creativity would make ""unlocking"" the different phases of each scene much more interesting.The islands are also pretty dull, with only a few exceptions. The overall setting and aesthetic of the game could best be described as ""mildly interesting"".Sound design is OK, but I don't understand why headphones were necessary. The game only seldom makes use of stereo panning, and the atmospheric sounds aren't soft enough so that regular speakers couldn't do them justice.Finally, the entire game is really short, about an hour tops. I know, I know... this sounds too much like ""the food was terrible, and the portions are so small!"" Perhaps this is the only saving grace of the game.Overall, Islands has some creative potential but falls flat. IMHO, the author would be better off stripping it down to a non-interactive demo (as in, demoscene-type demo), or adding complexity to make it a more interesting puzzle game, like ""The Witness"". I realize that this game is meant to be more of an atmospheric experience than a conventional game, but frankly I did not enjoy it in either context."

Each level starts out as a simple model of a man-made island - one of the many mundane structures we float between every day in modern life: A bus stop, a bank of ATMs, a baggage carousel; each rendered in ethereal monochrome. And through simple touch and exploration these objects transform and evolve in beautiful and unexpected ways. I found it to be a relaxing, dream-like experience. I even found it helped me get to sleep at night. It's a very short game, but definitely recommended."
