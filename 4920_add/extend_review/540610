I have a feeling it gives you more time with a higher combo. The only time you ever get a high combo is right at the end when you know where everything is.More often than not, the tile patterns you get are randomized in such a way that the puzzle is unsolvable. I spent 2 hours on ONE stage and either always got an unsolvable solution or a time out for taking too long. I hope you like seeing the phrase ""No More Pick"".There is NO hint system at all in this game.The sounds were so annoying I had to mute the game.This game would be better with a hint system, longer timer, and a better randomization algorhythm for the tiles. DON'T WASTE EVEN A DOLLAR ON THIS.If you are stuck with this bogus RNG mess, just download a full save file, beat the very first stage, and all the achievements will unlock.https://www.dropbox.com/s/gb2i6j38hsc35o5/DPGMSSavDat.sav?dl=0"

Well, maybe someone will say that there's always a good reason to put hot chicks anywhere, but I'd like to see a little effort to make it interesting.About the manga girls: there's nothing special about that. No animation, nor impressive drawing. Standard anime chicks, if you really need to see them just google ""hot anime girls"" or something like that and you will immediately get higher quality stuff for yourfapintellectual amusement.About the mahjong gameplay: damn, when someone put some effort into developing a videogame with a classic gameplay in it, I expect to see something new, a twist, an idea, even a little one, which makes that gameplay at least a bit different. Something which gives that videogame a reason to exist. I didn't find anything like that here, it's just a poorly designed mahjong solitaire with a timer. If you really need to play mahjong, just use the windows one. I'm not saying this because it's free, I'm saying this because it's plain better.Conclusions:This is nothing more than a basic, poorly designed, mahjong solitaire, with random, standard. anime girls. If you really need this stuff, I'll develop for you a game better than this right now: just play the windows mahjong while searching ""hot anime girls"" on google image. You'll get a better experience."

This is where you the player comes in as the hero to save those poor girls suffering from a very exotic obsessive-compulsive disorder!Work against a time limit if you want to go for a more realistic take on impatient girls, or take it leisurely (albeit less realistically) in easy mode. In any case, you have to help them get their dressing needs sorted out.Featuring a variety of Mahjong layouts, the actual game part is well done. How much can you do wrong with adapting Mahjong after all. The time limit in later levels can get really devious, especially if you insist on listening to the musical score while doing so (consider this hard mode). The Mahjong pieces feature japanese (I guess) visuals, which adds a bit of extra difficulty for the more prejudiced westerners among us (""They all look alike!"").All in all, a decent Mahjong game at a decent price. Especially when on sale, it's definitely worth it.(I kindly got this gifted by a friend, so it was definitely worth it.)"

,Recommended,540610,34100069,Posted: 8 August,all,Velka,"What started as a sleep-deprived purchase became four hours of mahjong hell.Delicious! Pretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire is a glorified version of Mahjong, except instead of being alone and pitiful, you are instead joined by a variety of different anime girls pretending to be interested in the game when in reality, all they do is strip their clothes off eventually.But before you start jacking it to the hotties, you have to get past the brick wall that is the actual game. This is some difficult mahjong, and although there is an easy mode, I do recommend playing on the normal difficulty as it's an enjoyable, if not frustrating experience.Mahjong is by no means a new concept in the gaming world, but Delicious! Pretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire managed to make me stay up an extra four hours trying to beat Bell's stage. At first it was about the nudes, but (after realizing this game doesn't have any nude content or an official nude patch) it soon became about sending a message to this godforsaken game that I can beat it without screaming.Recommended, especially for such a low price. Generous girls, generous game.please help meEDIT: some general misconceptions I wanted to clear up since I had these myself:-The game's easy mode simply outlines matching blocks for you. It's still a mindgame to see if you run out of matching pieces or not. This can be turned on in the menu for no penalty, though in my opinion, it's barely worth the shame of unskillfully getting your anime tiddies (/s).-Each girl has four ""levels"", which have three stages. There are seven girls at the beginning, along with two ""secret""girls you get for completing the other girls. Each girl's stages are of varying difficulty layouts, and they seem to not be in any particular order. Proceed with caution when picking a new girl, Mei's stages are especially painful. This totals out to roughly a few hours of content. I'd estimate 10 hours if you're really bad at mahjong, and maybe 2 if you're good.-There is an unofficial fan mod that gives you nude girls. Use this information at your own risk, though I doubt you'll like, ever get banned for this. Or banned for doing anything in this game.-The levels have a set layout and shape, but randomized pieces each time. The game is programmed well enough to not give you impossible layouts but it's more than possible to ""run out of moves"", so to speak. Treat moves with care.-There is an online scoreboard. You get more score by matching pieces quickly, and keeping the combo-chain up.-There is a gallery mode which allows for zooming in (weirdo) and oogling at what you've unlocked so far. Be sure to jerk it in offline mode, freaks.-You can save your progress in a level by simply quitting out. When you relaunch the game to play, you'll be greeted with a message asking if you want to continue from where you left off. If you say no, your progress in that level will be wiped, meaning you'll have to start from stage one of the level. Be careful!"
,Recommended,540610,26167211,"Posted: 22 October, 2016",all,Fart of Presto,"Looked at as a pure solitaire mahjong game, it's an OK casual time waster.The idea is to undress anime girls by beating 3-5 stages, consisting of 3 levels in each stage. When you beat a stage, the girl changes into a new dress that gets more and more revealing.While a couple of girls end up in a bikini and one of the girsl is only covered by soap bubbles, there is no more nudity than what you'd see on a regular beach in the US or other prudish places.The music is uptempo electronic bubblegum pop, like you would hear in any Japanese arcade game.The absolute worst part of the game is the voice acting. These girls moan and cry like something really bad is happening to them. and they have 2 or 3 phrases they keep repeating during a level, which ends up being unbearable. Thankfully, you can mute the voice track.Creep factor is huge here, what with the undressing of girls, and the moaning and crying, but mute the voice track, ignore the silly anime thing, and you get a pretty good casual solitaire mahjong game for only $1/€1."

I promise it will be way more fun and cheaper than playing this poorly drawn, badly programmed shovelware ""game"" that sells solely because of the presence of anime girls.There's literally only one thing that you can mess up when making a mahjong (or any other puzzle/logic) game - make it so it's unsolvable and dependable on RNG.In mahjong, a puzzle is unsolvable when there're only two matching tiles and one is underneath the other. ""You're out of tiles"", that's the story of this game. Happened to me 3 times in a row today, the last time you could see that it's impossible from the very beginning - only two tiles with the same picture spawned in my game and both on top of each other,screenshot for reference.Correct me if I'm wrong, but this issue should be easily fixable for any game developer.Another thing I find annoying is the timer and combos.Mahjong is a very relaxing game, perfect when played while listening to some music, or watching something on TV/your second monitor. I don't enjoy being pressed by time limits, I don't wanna compete with others in god damn mahjong, I don't care about leaderboards.When I play mahjong, I want to chill out and the game forces you to do the exact opposite.There's plenty better mahjong games and there's a lot of good anime games... why would you your waste time with this."

However, in this game it's spiced up by the combo system. It rewards players for taking quick decisions, which can in turn be deadly and lose them the game. Balancing speed is crucial to success in this game.The soundtrack is on point. I am amazed at the quality of royalty free music, that developers masterfully picked. I spent about an hour on just main title listening to music on first launch.The storytelling in this game is revolutionary. There is no VN dialog moments like you'd expect. Instead, the music sets the mood, and the female characters comment on current activities. It  makes the game much more immersive.The only two flaws I can think of, are lack of Steam Workshop to add more characters/boards to the game, and for some people the Japanese art direction might be off-putting.In conclusion, for only one dollar, this game is simply too good to pass up."

If you like Mahjong and search for a game to spend some free time on, good desicion. The music is pretty catchy and didn't annoy me a bit even after over 10 hours. The graphics are very pretty and you will love to look at it. The difficulty increases from game to game (so I was about to throw my laptop out of the window, so I will hear the goddamn Mahjong stones shatter on the street, together with my screen, because I had to retry the levels over and over again). BUT there is also an easy mode option for everyone else who doesn't like to throw their pc's from the 10th floor, so the girls finally change their outfits. That's the story about the Mahjong so far. Now we come to the PRETTY GIRLS. Of course, when we buy those games, we expect some skin, don't we? Since the game has a time limit, you don't really get much chance to check out the ladies on the left site. BUT WAIT! What solution do we have for this problem? RIGHT! The dressing room in which we can look at our babes as long as we want. Not all outfits are as revealing as you might hope, so don't expect anything too.. well you know. The drawings are really nice and enjoyable. So, should you buy this game? Oh yes, my friend. You should."
,Recommended,540610,28021766,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,nikolai60,"To start, I'd like to say that I'm a recovering Mahjong and Anime addict. This game completely ruined my progress towards getting away from these two things.The short version is: this game is better than 'Mahjong with fanservice' would imply, and is worth playing.Long version:Let's put the obvious to the side for the moment, and start with Mahjong itself.To my surprise, the team did not in fact take shortcuts, and as someone who has played Mahjong WAY too much in the past, I can say the Mahjong part of this game is in fact done properly and provides good gameplay. Which means it will be just as infuriating when 70 moves ago you shoulda picked one tile instead of the other. This of course means that they got the Mahjong spot on and you WILL find yourself saying 'just one more try' over and over again. The stacks are as random as in any other Mahjong game. The timer is also surpsingly well calculated, and since with every match you make adding more time, you find yourself having to balance speed with good choices. It is this last bit that I particularly enjoy about this particular game, as they hit the sweet spot with this setup.As for the more obvious bit, the anime (particularly the girls) are both a plus and a minus. The plus is Mahjong with actual rewards, in this case, costumes for the girls.The minus: BOY does the anime get distracting. Now this distraction is done right. It basically ups the difficulty without 'cheating' and actually interfering with the game itself. Instead, the girls mostly sound VERY cute while trying to get your attention (in Japanese I believe), as well as during the final round slowly switching to their new costume (don't worry if you miss it, there's a dressing room). Combine this with old school anime/game music that is well picked and somehow never gets old, and well, you'll find yourself either constantly looking off to the side or dancing in your seat to the music. and forgetting about the timer.Overall I say that yes, it's Mahjong with fanservice, but it's done in such a way that it doesn't cheapen any of the aspects, and instead uses two otherwise unrelated components and finds a way to actually have them complement each other in a way that works quite well."
,Not Recommended,540610,31337936,Posted: 24 April,all,Sarcastic Purple,"What is there to say about Pretty Girls Mahjong ?Well if you're on this Steam page, you have a pretty good idea of what you're looking for. For the clueless ones, this isn't actually porn, the best you can get is a naked girl with patches of foam on her nipples and crotch. But the girls, even if rather stereotypical, are actually rather cute and seem to have different personalities (although I don't speak japanese so I have no idea what the hell they were saying). Most outfits are pretty cute, some a little risqué but nothing too nude (apart from the one I mentioned earlier)I do need to talk about the gameplay. It's a Mahjong solitaire, so don't expect anything fun. It's at best lightly entertaining, unless you care about filling that combo meter, at worst extremely repetitive. And for those of you that have /had Windows 7, it's actually a WORSE game that the Mahjong game that came with it, because it doesn't tell you how many combinations are available and doesn't allow you to undo a move.This game will get frustrating. If, like me, you don't want to use the easy mode, you'll get very frustrated and spend hours of your life looking at the time meter ticking while an anime waifu will scream in your ear the same 3 phrases in japanese over and over again until you shut the game off.Plus, while the girls all have their music theme, the 3rd round of each stage has the same music regardless of the girl, so it'll be repetitive very fast.Would I recommand Pretty Girls Mahjong ? I can't honestly say so. As I said, if you played the Windows Mahjong game, you've played a better game already, so the appeal of this one would onle be the softcore porn and anime moans. But even then, you can find some games on Steam with more boobs and/or cuteness, so yeah. But hey, at least it's very cheap, so you could definitely spend your money in worse ways.Look at me. I've played more than 10 hours of this game, and I still can't finish it because I'm stuck at the screaming bunny girl levels and have too much pride in myself to lower the difficulty. I'm a broken soul. Save yourselves before it's too late.Yuno best girl"

This is a single player game, players should have the option to ""Cheat"" if they want too (and be expunged from the ranking if they do so or suffer point loss, etc.) namely the missing features are: a hint button, disabling the time up timer, and a undo previous action button. Frankly tho, I wouldnt use those anyways, but some people would enjoy the game more if they could, so there is no point in not having them in the game.The halloween mode toggle is nice. If you're sick of original icons you can swap to silly zombie heads, vampires, ghosts and bats. lol.As for the ""naughty"" stuff, its very tame, as is to be expected from a Steam apporved game, but overall is a nice touch. A little bonus. If I wanted that component to be central to the experince there are other avenues to take. It's the internet after-all.Overall an okay game. I enjoyed it, there are free mahjong solitaires that are ""better"" but the anime stuff was enough of a bonus for the slight cost of the game. The lack of ""easy-mode"" features makes this title hard for noobies to mahjong, but anyone with previous experience will be just fine (unless you think you're better then you are and blame the game because you suck, lol)"

,Not Recommended,540610,26108990,"Posted: 18 October, 2016",all,Cyphre,"So after many hours, I finally beat the entirety of what this game has to offer. However, that number is deceiving because it was primarily spent restarting over and over again, as 99% (yes, actually 99 out of 100) of all puzzles were unsolvable.After all the time I spent, I noticed a few things that were contributing to it. Besides the non-standard layouts presented that heavily stacked tiles, I noticed that there were several occassions where it didn't appear that there were 4 of a given tile. Perhaps I was mistaken, but it seems like it would lead to a lot of 'No More Pick' results due to impossible overlaps or trapped tiles. And then there is the quaint randomization algorithm that leads to a lot of tiles being near each other most of the time.Ultimately, the tags of this game are also not really applicable. There is no nudity whatsoever, and this game can hardly be classified as 'casual' with the 'speed game' timer always set. They really needed to pick a genre and stuck with it: either a mobile game type of tile speed matching with its respective combo meter and score, or an entirely different means of scoring that didn't involve a time limit. While the timer wasn't a huge issue, as any time I found myself running out of time, it was on a layout that already wasn't solvable by any means (the final remaining move didn't give access to anything meaningful).After it all, the rewards were fairly shallow and mediocre. That's not to say they were bad, as I've seen worse in other games, but I suppose I shouldn't expect much for a buck. The character voicing and sound effects were fairly loud and annoying, which became fairly grating after repeating the same rounds over and over again. Not a bad touch I suppose, but it's only cute for a minute or two."

The goal, however, is to expose(?) specific girls from games which are completely unrelated to Mahjong Solitaire. I don’t know if you are competing against them or if they just really want you to win a game of Mahjong Solitaire, but some get really mad or disappointed when you lose, it really confuses me.GameplayThe gameplay is literally a game of Mahjong Solitaire, for those who are unaware you play Mahjong solitaire by setting up Mahjong pieces into a certain pattern or structure. You then have to take down the structure by matching pieces with each other, however, there is a catch, you can only match pieces that are on the edge of the structure, adding difficulty to the puzzle. Delicious Pretty Girls is literally that but with a timer. Each girl has three to five levels and there are three stages per level. The first stage is literally just as described above, so is the second stage. But on the third stage is still the same but with a bit of strip poker, that is if strip poker consisted of the female changing clothes instead of taking them off.PROs- The music is pretty good, although there are only 4 tracks.- It can be played casually at lower levels, and can be a really enjoyable time.- Pretty cheap to play.CONs- The game is entirely luck based, sometimes to win a stage there are combinations which are right on top of each other and because of that, you automatically lose, and to make matters worse, each puzzle is randomly generated so there is no way you’re using a walkthrough for this game.- The timer. It is really frustrating when you can only make one move and you can't find it and then the timer is like ‘LAWWWWL’. Honestly, the game would be better without it, considering the fact that you lose so often, the game is better without it.Final ThoughtsAll in all, Delicious pretty girls is needlessly frustrating. There's little music to keep you playing. And in general it just gets boring after a while. I have no incentive to 100% this game legit, there is an add-on which will automatically 100% the game so just use that if you want to have the achievements. I'd recommend it If you’re looking for a casual puzzle game, the first few levels should suffice. But completionists beware, this game will make you bored and frustrated beyond belief. I give this game a final rating of 4/10.EDIT: turn on easy mode, you still get the achievments."

Prior to 2015, the only Zoo title we’d seen in the West was 1994 puzzler BreakThru! — which Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov had his name attached to despite having very little to do with — but all that changed with the release of Mahjong Pretty Girls Battle in January of that year.A new series was born, with Delicious!

All of the girls whine constantly with two different voice clips played over and over again (two other ones if it's a ""Final Round"") when you match tiles. You can mute the voices, but that's part of the entire point you'd get this version of mahjong solitaire specifically.Most of the boards can be cleared on a single try (unless you get really bad RNG), but a lot of boards are designed in a way where it's extremely likely to fail without getting a perfectly generated one. Being a timed game as well, you can't plan your moves ahead without risking running out of time.I literally spent like 18 hours beating the game with up to 1-2 hours spent on specific boards due to terrible tile generation.

I came across this game, and even though I don't like anime, it was a true mahjong game- and, it was cheap! Score! So, I gave it a go. There was some aggravation as the frequent ""No More Tiles"" could have been eliminated if they'd allow you to use the shuffle tile when there are no matching pairs- but, I suppose planning ahead is the name of the game. I found it helpful to isolate one pair that was the ""keeper,"" and should that ""keeper"" pair be the last pair standing, I'd hit the shuffle tile. Once this strategy was down, I flew through the game. There isn't nudity, as reported in the tags, just some skimpy outfits. I didn't mind, and it didn't detract/add to the game for me. It was overall a good mahjong game, so I purchased some more from the same developer. It was an easy way to get achievements, and another perfect game- totally helped with percentage completion percentage [it's a silly competition for bragging rights between my fiance and I].

The average/veteran player of Chivalry. They will do their best to beat you by using glitches and especially exploits.- ""Pro Tactics"", another gameplay 'feature'. If you really want to be good in this game, you must learn to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who uses glitches and exploits.- ""Over-realism"". Teamkill is so common yet people are not adapt of it yet, so expect killing some teammate even if he was FAR AWAY with just the very tip of your Morning Star, which should deal less than 5 HP or so yet it does full.Want more details?- ""High-rankers"", who are properly nicknamed ""Ballerinas"". These little insecure boys or big secure adults will try their best to ♥♥♥♥ you off and break your fun by using ""pro tactics"", that's an euphenysm for using glitches and exploits.Obviously, if you're experienced with multiplayer games, losers like these are common.Except in Chivalry, the entire population is made of them.- ""Pro Tactics"". The only way you can, let me quote the losers, ""git gud"" with Chivalry is to ""git gud"".Translated to our Badass language; you have to be a complete feckin' annoying moron who just swings crap from the side and does backwards attacks while going backwards.Translate to another language, probably scientific or just common; you have to rely on glitches and exploits to beat the game. There's no such thing such as ""Dirty Tactics"", these exist in Chivalry only if you're a low-rank, but then you'll get into the beauty (pure sarcasm) that is ""exploiting and glitching"".It's not normal how you can crouch backwards and then do an overhead attack hitting every one around you. Worse yet, how about you do a swing to the left then move yourself to the left? Apparently, the animation shows that it doesn't really do a ""strong hit"", it's so slow not even a door can fully open that way, yet the tip ALWAYS hits your head and it explodes. Funny, huh? It is, but sadly that joke gets old fast.- ""Over-realism"". For some strange reason, the game decided to be OVERLY realistic. And you can easily see that with the Teamkill. It seems that nearly all servers have teamkill enabled by default, so this is a default feature in Chivalry.I understand it's realistic and all, but the teamkill in Chivalry is easily abused. You can experience it yourself, a high-rank killing a low-rank. Happens EVERY time and I'm not exaggerating.It's not even the Ballerinas' sole fault, the developers wanted to make it so the team damage is always 100%. Worse yet, even an accidental teamkill will get your ♥♥♥♥ kicked just fine. As I said, the 'tip' can kill you just fine.The intention of this game looked good, a true melee game where you had some good freedom of how to use your weapons, each weapon was unique as well, so a mace against a sword IS a difference and not just in damage.If you don't know, here's an example; Maces were fit to break into heavy armour. In this game, who's got heavy armour? The Knight. So using a mace (any Blunt will do, actually) against him would be best.Great feature that the developers didn't even care at all on improving it further, because it CAN be improved.This game is only fun until you reach a high-rank, even 15 is enough. Then, you'll get into servers where there's no control, so you can fight against newbies, veterans and ballerinas.And hey, I must mention that back in 2014 around there, this crap had an update that added an in-game store. It was all decorations, sure, but it was still there. You HAVE to buy it.

If it is covered by other mahjongs, that means this game can only be solved by luck, not a player's logic.And a player can see this kind of unsolvable puzzles in the game very often. The only two things he can do is to restart the game and randomize the puzzle until it is solvable, or solving it by luck.The game is cheap, but don't think it will be too expensive for the production team to employ somebody to write an algoirthm for checking whether a puzzle is solvable or not.3/10 - I would play it when I don't want to use my brain."

I can't wait to show off my mahjong skills to some girls in my art class next monday! ^_^Post Review Edit: They didn't appreciate me showing off what I know about Mahjong, they called me an idiot and laughed at me. :/Okay, since I finally beat the whole game after around 20 hours of playtime, I'll try to give my honest opinion about it.First off, I personally think it was money and time well spent. I got the game for a buck and as I said have 20 hours of playtime.I won't deny that there are problems with the game though. The game in my opinion has 2 major flaws. The shuffling algorithm paired with the different ""map"" layouts can cause a lot of frustration.You won't believe how many No-More-Picks-Left I've gotten over the course of 20 hours.Quite a lot and I personally blame the shuffling algorithm the most for that.Especially in the later stages you get a lot of game overs because pairs are on top of each other or the shuffling was plain bad. The map layouts can also suck at times, sometimes they're very hard and the stage after that is a piece of cake.If you're into cute anime girls and/or puzzle games I suggest you give this game a go.If you really don't like the gameplay, you can always refund it. I personally think it was well worth it."

Pretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire despite it only being discounted by 5% (the full price is just a dollar, but still).Honestly, I could probably just copy-paste my review for the previous game, since not much has changed - and I actually think I will:All you do is look for matching tiles until you have cleared the board. Often, the tiles that you need are hidden somewhere at the bottom of the pile and the match can not be won, which annoyed me a bit at first. But then I remembered that that's the case with regular (card) solitaire as well, so things are probably as they should be.The girls in the game look pretty plain and the art is nothing special. Most of the voices also get very annoying after a whilehowever youcanmute them. Honestly, the game would have been just as good (if not better) without the girls, but I guess the creators would lose some potential sales if they just made a regular Mahjong Solitaire game.The soundtrack is nothing special, but after playing the same stage 10+ (20+, 30+) times, some songswillget stuck in your head.If you were planning to get this game just to see some half-naked anime girls - don't. If you like short and simple time killers like regular solitaire or Minesweeper, you will probably enjoy this game as well.I definitely recommend this game.

76561198341775566,Recommended,540610,29684663,Posted: 3 February,all,Peaky,"Pros:-Game is functional. No framerate issues.-Each girl acts as a sort of level with each one providing different types of tile layouts, thus, different challenges-Music, while somewhat limited and feels repetitive, is catchy. Some of it is reminiscent of older games.-Shuffling is AWESOME. It allowed me to actually build a strategy of sorts which made the game more fun.-Theres a simple mod out there that lets you enjoy some nudity if you're perverted(or just want a good laugh). It does cause a very minor bug in the ""Dressing Room"", nothing serious. Though it is a bit tough to find the mod.-Extremely cheap. Even if you don't like it, no big deal. Won't burn a hole in your Steam Wallet.Cons:-Voices. They either sound like they are in pain, or just spouting pure gibberish. I get that they are speaking japanese, but it sometimes sounds like they are talking with a mouthful of pudding.(to be fair, I have crappy built-in speakers and volume was low) Thankfully, you can turn off voice audio.-Characters are bland. No personality or anything. They spout the same japanese words over and over again. I also hate the designs of the two ridiculously busty girls. Seriously, it just looks ugly. I didn't really play this for hot anime babes(mostly for abnegation, the anime boobs is just an added bonus for giggles), but this was made for people to stare at them. So why make them look gross? Seriously how are they even standing? Most look okay but rather uninspired and stereotypical.-Difficulty level flails around all over the place. First girl? Easy. Second Girl? Easy. Third? Bit harder. Fourth? Pretty hard. Fifth? Cakewalk. The bunny girl, the 8th, is probably the hardest, and the final girl is by far the easiest, just takes a while. The devs clearly never heard the phrase ""Difficulty Curve"". Either that, or they simply don't know what it means.-I don't like the designs on the mahjong tiles. Let me rephrase that. I would like the option to change the designs on the tiles. Why not add a few pre-made templates that you can unlock? Its a no-brainer and I'm surprised the devs didn't think of that.Neutral:-UI is a little weird. Serviceable, just weird-Game is very short and easy to 100%. I did it in pretty much one sitting. You can get all of the achievements in about 6 hours, less if you're more used to mahjong solitaire than I am. This isn't a BAD thing as it has a lot of replay value as a simple pastime.

It's just feels like the level designer randomly generate the puzzles and assume they can be done with several try. However, many levels are frustrating and you can pass them only by LUCK, which means you may try tons of times to pass one level. (PS: I have spent more than 3 hours on just one level) This game is not casual at all, instead of that you will find you are just torturing yourself to finish the game and get those achievements."

I just not fond of breasts that can be used as pillows for up to 3 people and you can get lost in.I am not a fan of Mei's lines. Only one I can understand but the rest seem too ""Date rapey"" like lines, specially with the look she is giving you. Others may enjoy her personality and looks but I am just not a fan of it.Megumi looks like she could be your mother so I am not a fan of her and seems wrong.The other girls I am ok with, the first girl I love her outfits and the mystery girl is of course a fan favourite and you will see why if you play it or google some pictures and find her.Now this game suffers what pretty much other Mahjong games suffer from and that is the fact you often get a layout where the last pieces are on top of one another, meaning you was doomed from the start to have to retry. Many hate this and seems like a waste of time. The girls come in no difficulty so you may be lucky at one girls stages later in the line-up compared to the 2nd or 1st girl. It is down to luck.Give the game a go if your a Mahjong fan, it is one of the few games which doesn't have a stupid ""energy"" system to stop you playing so you can play to your hearts content. Don't let your friends judge you just because it has anime girls painted over it.If you just want to see the girls however, just check the community guides because I can see you giving up very easily on the gameplay itself, hence why the achievement stats are low for this kind of game. Oh and as the developers have said, there is NO NUDITY! So save your money if you was expecting nudity looking at the screenshots.

There's no undo, it's completely randomized so you can get an unwinnable hand and there's only one mode. Try to keep a steady stream of matches going to continue your combo chain and the timer on the bottom stays full, idle or don't match for too long and the timer runs out or simply becomes too hard to beat even with a new combo streak.Sometimes the stage is simply unbeatable, sometimes you put yourself into a losing state by having three tiles and two different match choices and picking the wrong one (do you match to reduce a stack of tiles or remove a piece leaving surrounding ones open) all while the clock ticks down.It's fun and challenging and if you like that style of mahjong then you'll probably get a few hours of fun out of the gameplay. Also less than a dollar, which is an incredible price drop compared to their other titles, so if you're interested at all, worth the price in my humble opinion.Unlockable CG's - If you find the girls attractive then completing a stage (three rounds per stage) unlocks the cg permanently in your gallery so you can look at it when you're not racing the clock. Even if the girls leave you lackluster (and yes, 90% of the cgs are just generic outfit and/or cosplay with usually one 'racey' picture for the final stage) if you had a helluva time finishing that stage you might just go look at it simply to be able to say - 'In your face sweater dress!

The 6 cards you get may be worth as much or more than the initial game purchase."

I quickly learnt to play this game within seconds and I smashed the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the first few stages because I found it so entertaining. The Anime girls on the side aren't interesting and I just ignored them as I try-harded the game. This game is extremely fun to play and I'm glad I picked it up.

The game only checks if the puzzle is solveable at the beginning and when you run out of matches. It should check for solveability each match so it can cut the match short if the solution is gone. It can be frustrating when you realize you wasted a match at the beginning and it ends up ruining the game for you a minute later when you need those pieces, but the game didn't stop you from wasting your time. Also the combo timer is absurdly fast."
,Recommended,540610,26092346,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,TcTamas,"While I was disappointed at first, the game is not as bad as people make it out to be.TL;DRDecent mahjong game, challenging from mediocre shuffle algorithm and a fast timer, some teasing pictures, but nothing serious. Get it if you have too much freetime and 1$ isn't too much for you.Full ReviewDifficultyIt's a bit hard at first, especially if you don't know how the game works. Horizontal levels are much harder, cause you can chose less tiles. Try to get rid of the top layers first and save the lowest layer for the end, this helps you a lot. A hint system would be helpful though...Randomized stagesThe randomizer algorithm could use some work, but I don't think it generates unsolvable stages. Most of the time you choose a tile over another one and that ends up causing problems later on.TimerThe timer IS really harsh, but you get more time from matching tiles, which is nice. If you're struggling with the time, take a screenshot, pause the game, and paste the image into paint or something. You get used to the timer later on.VisualsMost tiles look VERY similar, and it's too easy to mix them up, or miss them completely. The 3D levels are sometimes hard to notice too.GirlsThe girls are a nice extra content, but don't expect too much. While nudity is one of the tags, there's none of that, and I haven't found a patch either. You get some underware, swimsuit, and one bath picture. You can't customize the girl you're playing with even if you unlocked more costume versions. All you have is a ""Dressing Room"" galery.MusicI love the tracks, but that's up to your taste"

Nevertheless, because of my love of this type of ""match two"" game I decided I would give it a go.There are seven girls and between three & five stages per girl each stage has four levels and the idea is that as you successfully progress through the stages the girls clothing gets skimpier.The bit that interests me the most is the gameplay - no honestly.  There is a timer which slowly reduces as you play and there is a combo meter which slows the timer down. (If you get the next pair within a couple of seconds it keeps the combo meter going and pushes it back, as far as I can tell while the combo meter is occupied the timer stalls) But the main reason I like this game is because games of the match Mah Jhong tiles type are normally a walk in the park where you just progress from one level to the next rarely missing. Not with this game (at least not for me) It is so easy to fall in to traps where the next pair you want is covered by it self that it happens frequently except obviously in the first level or two.Recommended.EDIT-Just thought I'd add, this game cost me £00.75p . You get 6 trading cards all of which dropped within the first two hours and almost all sold for more than £00.10p I think I got around £00.60p from selling them so total cost around £00.15p for a half decent (pun intended) game."

The game is actually pretty easy to understand. It's all about finding pairs of pictures that look exactly the same and the confusing symbols have no special meaning whatsoever. (They could probably sell the game mutch better if they replace the confusing glyphs with some simple pictures.) I think that if there was no time limit then a five year old child would have no significant trouble with this game. Well... until the parents enter the room. Then the five year old should quickly switch to porn, because porn is so mutch easier to explain.Actually this is the 2nd game of this developer that I played. I was not very impressed by the first one. But my @#$% was slightly itching, so I thought: ""OK, why not give the developer a second chance and try out this very cheap game"". I ended up regretting nothing.I don't mind that sometimes you get stuck and have to replay levels. That doesn't matter. What matters is the game's well-made charisma. What matters it that the music makes you want to shake your body in rythm. What matters is that you are under a constant time pressure and have to desperately search for matching pieces. What matters is that you get all sweaty. Simply put this game is entertaining as hell.Conclusion: If you want to spend the evening engulfed in some hardcore Japaneese weirdness then this is the game you are looking for.EDIT:Correct me if i am wrong. After some more playing I noticed a serious flaw that needs to be pointed out and deserves fixing. Later in the game it becomes pretty obvious that certain levels with certain initial positions of the stones are unsolvable. So the question whether you beat a sertain level becomes no longer a challenge of your reflexes, careful thinking, sharp perception and memory (as it should be). Instead it becomes a chalenge of of how mutch time you are ready to waste in order to play the level over and over again until you are lucky enough to get a solvable initial state. This means that the game punishes the player for something that isn't the players fault. The developer could at least implement some solver algorithm to check whether a solution for the initial stone positions exist at all, before the player it prompted to solve it. I think that such a flaw doesn't belong into a high quality game and the developers must solve it ASAP in order to save their face. A problem like this one shows that the game has a serious issue caused ONLY by the fact that the daveloper was to lazy in order to do a bit more of programming.What kind of other less serious improvements to I wish for this game?1. All of the characters need multiple facial expressions (right now there are exceptions).2. It should be possible to select the facial expression in the ""dressing room""-mode.3. ability the select the initial character outfit for the start of the next level (if the outfit is already earned of course.)4. The music should not be interrupted and restarted when the player is forced to restard the level (which might become inevitable as already mentioned).5. Subtitles. I understand nothing the characters say.6. An official patch that makes the game even more kinky available as a seperate download. (Because to mutch kinkyness might make steam refuse to distribute the game. This made such patches a common practice for games like this one). After all this is the main reason for this game to be played. So this aspect deserves to be emphasised.7. And to finish with something positive: The game's music is pretty good. It deserves a sountrack-DLC."

The game feels less unfair and frustrating that way. For a dollar, it's a nice solitaire mahjong game with fanservice. Unlocking everything should keep you busy for some hours. The soundtrack is nice, too. Every girls seem to have their own musics."

Thanks dev!Changed review to positive!OLDI'm sorry but the tile algorithm are broken. Far too often you will find two tiles that is stacking on top of each other. When the tile configuration get more complex, most of the time you will find impossible to solve puzzles.No matter how cute the girls are, it doesn't matter if you can not see them."

76561198141937508,Recommended,540610,29230856,Posted: 13 January,all,Jopas Jas,"This is a fun Mahjong game. You play against a timer and some of the towers can be quite tricky. The tiles are good to see. I prefer Mahjong without a timer, but in this case, you get some - more or less creative - graphical incentive for beating the timer. I suggest a certain patch for more exciting incentives. ;)Points of critic is that there could easily be more animations. Only in the last round of each stage does the picture change. This should happen in every round. The music is unbearable, but you can easily turn it off. The girls have funny voices. They are so embarrassed to lose their (not much hiding anyway) clothes. I wonder what made them participate in the first place. ;p"

Only problem is, the cards are shuffled and placed unfairly most times and can lead to a punishing defeat at the very end. This makes the game frustratingly hard. But you can get past it after a few attempts and win. Nice music. 60fps gameplay!"
,Not Recommended,540610,33945144,Posted: 1 August,all,Alwaysanarchy,The thing that frustrates me the most on this game is the fact that you get unsolvable puzzles too often or that you somehow need to predict the future because you can't make a single mistake and with the pressure of the time you end up losing anyway. I literally got 1 game where there were no moves left after matching 2 tiles and lost at 1.2 secs of starting.Only thing worth noting is that you get 6 card drops that you can sell in the marketplace for a total amount equal to the price of the game so basically it's a free game.
