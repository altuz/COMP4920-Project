,Not Recommended,540740,28450043,"Posted: 18 December, 2016",all,Spraynard,"I really, really, really wanted to like this. Atmospheric locations in VR, especially with rich ambient sound and detail, are my absolute favorite.Pros:- Some wonderful vistas- Radio is a neat addition- Great sound- I like what they were going for?Cons, Unfortunately:- Weak sound for the grabbable objects- Controllers will amost constantly vibrate, because if either controller's tip meets a grabbable object in a straight line, it will highlight the object white and vibrate the controller -- both of which detract from immersion- Looking at your controllers detracts from immersion because there's constant white text overlaid on them- Also detracting from immersion are the huge red columns that ""highlight"" teleport points. But then come up if you're looking in their general direction. I'm sensing a pattern here. For a game that tries to immerse you, there's a lot taking you out of the experience.- You cannot teleport within the unique environments once you've teleported to them. Why? I want to stroll around but am greeted by my boundaries, and I do not have a small play space. I understand limiting the player to see only what you want them to see, but if I can walk somewhere physically, why can't I just teleport there?- There was light emphasis placed on discovering/exploring...but there's really only 9 locations, and while their mid-and-foregrounds are nicely detailed, your immediate surroundings have weak texture work and nothing to discover. The fires are nice (and their sound!) and I LOVE the way the tents' rippling sound effect works out (and the way they're inner-lit at night), but beyond that, you're relegated to throwing the exact same rocks and sticks.Bizarre :(. I like the lantern and the moths at night though. Those are the sorts of minutae I tought would fill these levels. Instead, the soundscapes take centre-stage. On one single occasion, I smoked a certain euphoria-inducing plant, went to a campground's night location, and closed my eyes a tiny bit to blur my vision and remove the awful pixelization, and for a few moments I was totally 100% immersed.I was able to walk around without seeing Chaperone boundaries, and it was wonderful. Then a nearby wolf howl scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me (is there light 3D sound work here? It sounds so dynamic and lifelike!) And for that one moment, I loved it. So real! Then I came-to. And the rest of the problems flooded back.I think these guys read their Steam reviews. I'm not trying to ceaselessly bash Perfect. I'm typing so much because I care; because I love these developers and really appreciate the gap they were trying to fill with this experience, but my hype wasn't met and I wish there was more attention to detail paid in a lot of respects."

,Recommended,540740,28410992,"Posted: 16 December, 2016",all,Kaleign Genikal Gilkaen Kaelign,"It's kind of like theBlu ambient mode. There are 3 scenes (frozen wilderness, tropical island, mountain) that you can visit during the day or night. You can teleport between 3 locations in each scene. There are ambient sounds and events that occur.Some things I liked to do (there's no plot, but these are kind of spoilers):- sitting on a mountain cliff and looking out across the trees and water- looking up at the aurora borealis and hearing nocturnal beasts in the distance- chilling on the dock and watching tropical fish swim aboutI agree with suggestions from others that there should be rock skipping (though I think rock interaction should be an option) and more focus on things to look at while lying down. I also think amount of ambient events should be an option, so you can have a more solitary or active experience."
,Not Recommended,540740,28463037,"Posted: 18 December, 2016",all,Aegir,"I love the idea of this game, and I want a game that's similar. Like other have mentioned, there is a lot that take out out of the experience like controller vibration, cartoony swooshing noises when you throw things, or most annoyingly not being able to move around even the limited space you are given. My favorite vista was the cliff above the cabin, but even with my large play space, if I walked over to the fence to look out over the edge I was greeted with my chaperone. That said, my only real problem is that the game lies on the border of two styles, but doesn't dive in to either. It's not realistic enough for me to really lose myself in, but it's not entertaining enough to be able to find something to do. I would love a good realistic atmosphere game, where you can lie on your carpet in your apartment at 2am and look up to see the sun shining on the beech, or sit down on the dock and watch fish while you throw stones in and watch them react to it. There's just not quite enough there to make it a truely immersive atmosphere. On the flip-side, the limited interaction is almost entirely objects you can throw, but they don't really impact the environment at all. The best was throwing snowballs and watching them crumble, but that got old pretty quick. Sadly I only played it for about 10 mins before I got bored, and as much as I reaaaally want to support all the VR devs and their hard work which I know was put in to this, I can't quite recommend it as an experience or a game just yet."

I like to relax to my own music library not music deemed relaxing by the devs :( You can play the music on your desktop and then switch off the radio so perhaps this is the way around this.2) Stop the excessive vibrations when you're hovering over the interactable items. The controllers are forever rumbling and they do distract a bit from the overall ambience.Going ahead, the following would make this an essential purchase.1) Invite friends to join you a'la VTime for the Oculus/Gear VR2) More movement and interaction. To be able to light the fire, scratch things into the snow with the stick, a fishing rod on the pier would be an utterly amazing side game and really add something special to this - catch things to put on your pier - and for it to be able to save!3) More variation over longer times. You could perhaps see a shark come over from the distance, Changing weather conditions would also be amazing :) Perhaps actually see a wolf in the woods after several minutes of peering into the darkness :)4) Seasonal variations and special editions- such as a zombie shuffling about in the trees at Halloween, Santa shooting across the snowy skies on his sleigh over the Christmas period etc.5) A splash in the water etc of a manta ray coming up to skim the surface would add something extra :)Ok, perhaps I got a bit carried away but this certainly has potential. The graphics were great, the sounds were good and I really enjoyed it for the price!Recommended!"

I haven't seen every map but it's neat from the ones I've seen. But yeah the water stone skipping would add a lot I think. For the price, it's not too shabby."
,Not Recommended,540740,30133273,Posted: 23 February,all,Egomie,Simply not fun or relaxing.  The fact that you are stuck in one of 3 or so places in each area just makes it frustrating when you want to go even slightly out of bounds.  Gets old immdediately.

,Not Recommended,540740,28495173,"Posted: 20 December, 2016",all,tomsode,"The ""interactive"" part is stones or sticks that you can pick up and throw into water. There is also only a few places you can move between in each location making it a very static and boring experience. Just use destinations to look at various places instead."
76561198075259746,Not Recommended,540740,28474558,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,plasticreality,"I really want to like Perfect, even if the name is a bit pretentious. I would gladly pay more for an application that convincingly transports me to beautiful locations I couldn't visit normally. The graphics and sound design, however, don't really accomplish this. Let me explain.To start, the aliasing is quite bad. After cranking the graphics (which only has five dots indicating higher or lower quality) and supersampling at 2.0, distant objects would continue to unrealistically shimmer. The aliasing is somewhat mitigated during nighttime scenes, but it's still noticeable. The textures are also subpar. Considering Perfect is all about the audio/visual experience, I expected higher resolution textures on rocks, wood, trees, and other objects.On the positive side, the snow, campfire, and water effects are great. The Aurora Borealis is also quite beautiful.The sound design is a mixed bag. You constantly hear birds during the daytime scenes at the beach and lake retreat, yet you never see them, which is odd. Sound is used to much better effect at the nighttime artic location. You hear wolves in the distance, but it makes sense given you wouldn't be able to see them in real life (unlike birds). The background sounds are often a bit too loud as well, with no way to adjust them.Also, every throwable object make the exact same ""swoosh"" sound, which takes me out of the experience. The ambient radio music, however, is quite good.Another problem is the background events that take place at locations, which I guess is an attempt to make the locations more exciting. I was enjoying the feeling of being alone in nature when all of a sudden a hot air balloon and a hang glider appeared and flew across the sky (the hang glider flew directly above me). It felt as though some adventure-seeking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s had ruined my quiet moment in nature.In its current state, I cannot recommend Perfect for those looking for a convincing relaxation experience. If some of these issues are addressed in future patches, I'll be sure to update my review accordingly."

It is the highest quality relaxing experience on the Vive, the only one that brings me a true state of chill.  The little details really make it, such as the realistic splash when you throw a stone into the water, or the sparkles of ice crystal facets on the snowballs.  The three environments are well chosen, and well worth the price.A couple comments for the devs:Vive convention is trigger selects and trackpad teleports.  You mostly abide by this except on the main menu.  Trigger, not trackpad should select.In Perfect Beach on GearVR, I loved the perpetual beach sunset.  I would love a sunset time of day on the beach map.Also, it would be nice to be able to turn off haptics once you know what is interactable.Vive pro tip. Turn chaperone bounds to Developer in settings.  An option for this in-game would also be nice."

It seems the goal of the devs is to place the player in a destination where they can forget about the hustle and bustle of our fast paced modern world. I enjoyed this VR experience. After playing for an hour listening to music and skipping rocks, I actually felt more relaxed then when I started. I imagine the best way to enjoy this game is to plop a chair in the middle of the play space and relax. It's an escape. With that said there are some things I would like to see in this game. Being able to choose my music to listen to while in the environments. A multiplayer option to allow friends to relax together. A moon/space environment. More environments and I want to jump in that canoe and paddle down the river. I didn't mind spending the $9.99 for it. If they continue to update and add environments it will be worth it. Remember when buying this game it is all about drinking in the vista and being calm and still. There is no story. Check out my gameplay in the link below.https://youtu.be/--gf0LcEv-4"
