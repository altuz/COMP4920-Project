,Recommended,540840,28182133,"Posted: 4 December, 2016",all,Reliant39,"This is an excellent, simple puzzle game. I love the minimalist aesthetics. I originally bought this game for my iPhone, then bought it again when it was released on the Windows store, and now bought it a third time on Steam. The Steam release removes the in app purchases (hints are now free) and also adds controller support, which is fantastic.The game distils the Tomb Raider format down to its essence: you'll play through a large number of small(ish) linear levels, where you will have to shoot wild animals, dodge others, and solve puzzles to reach the end and progress to the next level. The game is essentially turn-based, with enemies moving only when you make your move. You can also hunt around (using the right stick on the controller) for vases that contain items, which is great for your inner hunter-gatherer.It's a small game that you'll probably finish in a few hours or so, but it's a pleasant experience, with great visual design, and a few fun puzzles along the way. It's an excellent way to waste a few hours and I couldn't recommend it highly enough. I, for one, will play through the entire game yet again and am more than eager to do so."

Had to do some RL stuff while I was playing, so the recorded 4 hours isn't ""time played"".If you get this one on 50% off, sure go ahead. Otherwise, maybe wait and see if they release more content. It seems a bit too much to ask normal price for a game this short.The game is a port from mobile platform, and as such the controls aren't usual PC controls. At first it is a bit clunky because no keyboard controls and you have to drag the mouse around, but I quickly found my way around that. After 10 minutes I didn't notice it much.However, I can't recommend until there is more content (and no, payed DLC doesn't count).10 EUR asking price isn't high, and the game is of reasonably good quality, but it really feels way too short.Edit: I updated my review and changed it to recommend, because after you complete the main cmpaign, there is actually another adventure that I didn't see at first. This is a bit harder, and makes the game long enough to justify buying this game."
,Recommended,540840,29761018,Posted: 7 February,all,Atarun,"DescriptionLara Croft GO, much like Hitman GO, is a reinterpretation of the Tomb Raider game series as a puzzle game. In this turn-based stylized cell-shaded isometric 3D platform game, you'll have to think, try and retry to find the right path. Enemies move and traps activate only when you move and there is no time limit here, so you can take your time and you can retry indefinitely (or bail and use the hint system).ProsCute art style that looks just as nice on PC as it does on tabletsMechanics so self-explanatory there is no tutorial and very little text (and no actual need for either)Hint system alleviates any potential frustrationRelaxing atmosphere throughoutConsDie and retry is mandatory (though as painless as possible)Awkward mouse controls (sliding in the desired direction is clearly meant for touchscreens, I would advise using a gamepad instead)VerdictLara Croft had already embarked on a journey through puzzle-adventure games with the Guardian of Light and Temple of Osiris. Here the logic is taken to the extreme by stripping away all the action... and yet somehow part of the feel of the franchise remains. At times, this game reminded me of the first Tomb Raider more than the rebooted Tomb Raider franchise. To me, it felt more like an answer to the question ""What if the first Tomb Raider had actually been a puzzle game?"" than to ""What other genre can we put Lara Croft into?""If you're a fan of Lara Croft or if you enjoy relaxing brain teasers, you'd do yourself a disservice to avoid this game.However if all you've ever appreciated in Tomb Raider games is their action, if you despise their puzzle and platform mechanics, stay away."
,Recommended,540840,33006080,Posted: 29 June,all,Seph,"Lara Croft GO is amazingly good for what was originally a smartphone game.To start off, I'd like to say that this game offers a curiously relaxing experience, with its chill music and beautiful, stylized environments. And that's what sets this game apart, really. It gives off a very comfortable atmosphere.The gameplay is about going through different stages while managing Lara's position to avoid enemies and environmental traps, all the while manipulating contraptions or making use of the unique characteristics of each stage to be able to progress. The level of challenge is just right since the game carefully introduces new mechanics in easy levels, then develops them in harder ones.It's ""turn based"" in the sense that the world only moves forward when Lara moves forward, giving you as much time as you need to think things through.There are also some collectibles hidden in the stages if you wanna go pixel hunting to unlock new clothes for Lara. If you find a golden vase hidden anywhere, you click it to discover a relic or a gem. It's a neat little bonus.Recommended for anyone who wants a simple, relaxing and extremely well crafted experience."

I have certainly enjoyed my time with this gem of a puzzle game. Maybe its not to everyones liking, but I certainly loved playing it. I managed to play through each level several times to make sure I collected all the relic pieces and the differant gems. I also used hints at times to help me through some tougher levels. Game plays very well with Xbox controller, OR you can just use the mouse, choice is yours. I actually found using the mouse much better & easier than using the controllers right toggle stick to move the curser around collecting hidden items, so mouse was great for moving Lara and finding the hidden items. The items are hidden very well so look very carefully.As far as price is concerned, its worth any price you choose to pay. Right now its 50% off so its a better deal than what I paid, but still I have no regrets paying the full price when I did.The game also just got updated with a new chapter called The Mirror of Spirits & 1 new achievement .The game is very easy to 100% all achievements as I have now 100% with all achievements & finished the game. I was Very happy with this game, I enjoyed it immensely. :)"

Puzzles are fun and rewarding, story is... nonexistant (but who cares?), visuals are really pretty and it will entertain you for approximately 7 hours, which means, that now, during the Summer Sale, it's really worth buying for only 3,34€.

Despite that being a relatively ♥♥♥♥♥♥ move by square enix; I still bought it. I completed the entire game + the ""extra"" mission. And I recommend it.The minimalistic graphics are wonderful, it's sleek and soothing. And the puzzles are hard enough that once I solve them, I cannot believe I hadn't figured it out before.I love puzzles, but I'm bad at them. So I must admit to actually using the hint-feature. And even if YOU think you're bad at this sort of game, you can still complete it, enjoy the puzzles you can beat and when you get stuck the ""hint"" button will show you what you were supposed to do. Step by step.It's a short game compared to the price, there are other games in the same price-class that will give you endless hours of entertainment.

,Recommended,540840,30049266,Posted: 19 February,all,Aussiedroid,"A lesson learnt; do not judge a book by its cover...DismissingLara Croft:GOseveral times as some sort of shallow spinoff game using the Tomb Raider popularity, a cash grab at worst or lacking content at best, Steam Store was persistent to keep recommending this. With a healthy dose of scepticism I decided to give it a try .. several hours later it had me completely hooked!Easing you in with simple puzzles & tasks, it continues to build on its foundations. Introducing new mechanics, new enemies, larger maps, combining what you have previously learned & adding more & more layers to it. Granted, I found the puzzles for the first half of the game to be fairly straight forward, most still offered enough of a challenge to have to replay a couple times as you discover the nuances designed into each puzzle. Although these earlier levels are quick, there are a decent number of them to complete.While working your way through each level, there are also hidden items to find. Clicking on these will collect them, but as the camera is fixed, so they may only be visible from certain squares. Finding some of these offered more challenge than the earlier puzzles! Collect a set & it will unlock other outfits for Lara. Was a good addition to the main puzzle mechanics along with the few interesting achievements to unlock which are some mini puzzles within themselves. Both offer a reasonable amount of replayablity.The automatic camera direction gives scope/depth to the levels even when small. Graphically, the retro low-poly art design looks really good, even if some of the animations are a bit basic.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=868042618Moving on to the later levels, especially the last location of'The Caves of Fire', really upped the challenge. I probably spent more time there that all the other five combined, evening resorting to theoccasionalhint after getting stumped for way too long:)The complexity of these later puzzles was impressive, & not was I expected from a small mobile game. Leaves me really looking forward to the next Chapter,'The Mirror of Spirits'coming soon ... & for free!One thing I was less impressed with was the control translation. Using an analog stick on a controller, I found the movement to be very sensitive to small movements. This often resulted in accidental miss-steps. Using Steam's built-in controller customisation I was able to reduce this sensitivity to a degree, but I do not know how many times I had to restart a puzzle due to a double step or wrong direction.It could have benefited from some more attention to translate the touch style interface into a more precise mapping with a controller. Works fine, if you are somewhat careful but could be better in my view.Lara Croft:GOplays to its strengths & doesn't pretend to be anything it is not. For the price, there is a plentiful amount of content, some replayability & a decent challenge to be had. This is one of those rare mobile ports that is actually worth playing & certainly worth a recommendation!If you enjoyed reading this review, please followTrue Blue Reviewsfor more recommendations!"

Have a look at the screenshots and you will get a good idea of the kind of puzzles it has.The game itself is a no-effort port from a mobile-phone game. There is no other control method than ""swipe"" with your mouse: drag your mouse up/down/left/right then release. There is no saving. So if you have to leave the game unexpectedly and return to the game, you could end up restarting the whole chapter or restarting the puzzle. I never figured out why the game does or doesn't save your progress.The graphics are simple but good, the backgrounds are detailed, the music & sound are good.

I still managed to finish most of the levels on my own though and had quite a lot of fun while doing so. On the other hand I got the game for free.

Compared to other games in the series it also doesn't have the ""complete the level in under 15 turns"" challenges which I disliked and the environment aesthetics are gorgeous.Regarding how it plays on PC - I own both Hitman and Deus Ex GOs on my phone and I actually prefer having a bigger screen for these games. You have to click and drag to move Lara around on PC though but you get used to it pretty quickly.The only complaint is that I would love to see more levels, 100%'d the game in two sittings and now there's not much to do, sadly.Well worth the full price, imo."

So I guess if that's an option for you, go that rout instead of picking it up on steam.2: The puzzles were a lot of fun, although far too simple early on. I realize that's just common game design, teaching you the rules before letting you dive in fully. But in truth, it takes a large chunk of the entire main campaign before they really let loose with any tricky stuff.2.5: The fifth ""new adventure"" chapter is definitely where the best puzzling is, and where about 3.5 of my 8 hours(for full 100% achievements) was spent... though a huge chunk of that was spent hugely overthinking two specific puzzles.  I've seen another reviewer mention their length to be around 5 hours, and that sounds about right for anyone who ""gets it"" right off the bat(and does everything there is to do without looking anything up... If you skip all the collecting, and achievements, I'm sure you could plow through in a couple hours).3: I'm sure the aesthetic is going to be hit or miss for a lot of people, but I personally found it to be gorgeous. The music was also perfectly atmospheric. While every aspect of the gameplay is pure puzzling, the game is designed(and more importantly presented) in such a way that it definitely still gives  a strong feeling of thrills and action. Especially towards the end of the main campaign.Honestly, this game felt like the perfect minimalist companion to the old school Tomb Raider games... and without any of those damn swimming levels to boot. Again, I recognize that it can be found cheaper elseware, but I in know way felt cheated by the 8$ I spent on it. And if you wait for an epic steam sale, it's absolutely 100% worth whatever pittance you'll end up paying for it."
,Recommended,540840,33324644,Posted: 6 July,all,kertitorpe,"While the mainline Lara Croft games always represent the epitome of the current-gen action-adventure AAA gaming, Eidos cleverly branches out to the puzzle genre time to time. I loved both Guardians of Light and Temple of Osiris and after having a blast with Hitman GO, purchasing this one seemed like a no brainer. Little did I know that this game was a massive improvement over Hitman. Good graphics, fluid control and excellent level design. The game slowly introduces new mechanics, so it's always fresh and challenging. The first few levels are extremely easy to solve, however by the time you reach the fire levels, the difficulty greatly increases. It even features a kind of boss battle, which is very funny considering the turn-based nature of the game. Kudos to Eidos for yet another masterpiece!"

In many ways a purer Tomb Raider than the 2 recent 'reboot' games.Gameplay wise this is a follow up to Hitman Go, which is actually a harder game, with many levels requiring replay to get all Achievements. Lara Croft Go can still be challeging, but never frustrating. It doesn't have the cool 'boardgame' look of Hitman Go, but it has a nice stylistic feel that fits the Tomb Raider theme well.If you like the look of this, and like the sound of turn-based puzzles with a Tomb Raider theme.

(Fun fact: the menu music is an ultra slow version of the classic Tomb Raider theme.)The main story has a steadily ramping difficulty and the expansions mix things up with new distinct environments and puzzle components like enemies that won't stay down in Shard of Light and light beam switches and your mirror image in Mirror of Spirits. The latter was made by a different team and it's interesting how you can feel it: The puzzles often look lengthier and more intimidating but are actually solved relatively easily or sometimes by accident on the first go, like I did on the very last one.The situation is somehow reversed from the earlier episodes where the in-game hint option might start to tempt you when the solution to a seemingly simple board just eludes you.

Couldn't open the menu or control Lara in the game.  Would have to close the game and reopen it.

It’s not too challenging but if you get stuck there is a walkthrough mode.-The aesthetic is pleasing and the cartoon fashion will keep it timeless.-Story is told without any words but is clearly told and once you face the final boss it gives you great satisfaction.-Nostalgia, the game is in all respect a Tomb Raider game, the feel and look of it match that of early games being a true tribute to it’s predecessor focusing on puzzles over mindless action.Cons:-The game is a port from phone. It has touch screen controls, meaning you have to click and drag as if you were playing as on a touch screen to move Lara.-In addition there are no hotkeys to get to restart you have to go to menu then click restart button. Not a big deal but takes you out of the game.-Buggy text boxes. The game has few moments where it introduces a new mechanics and it is explained with a text box however during my play through the text boxes stayed on screen for a millisecond before disappearing.General Thoughts:This game is a wonderful representation of what Lara Croft used to be, if you ever played the original games the main menu screen will tug on your nostalgia strings immediately. The puzzles are of good in complexity if rather simple at times, however the final chapter really testing your skills. The collectables allow you to unlock costumes that Lara has worn over her lifetime making them somewhat worth your time if you’re a fan. The worst part of the game is the port quality and how unintuitive the controls are at the start of the game, I thought my game was broken and with no control menu you’d have to look it up online how to actually play the game. I figured out the click and drag controls by sheer coincidence.

I love that the levels didn't feel tedious, in the way that there is no challenge to beat levels in a low amount of moves, or in a given amount of time. All you have to do for the 100% is beat the game, and find all of the hidden gems and relics. The game has good progression as more and more different elements are slowly added to the puzzles. At one point there was a pretty noticable difficulty jump, but the game never got too hard, and there are hints if needed.  Lara Croft GO was a relaxing and quick experience, I would highly recommend it as the asking price isn't too high either."

The hidden collectables are inferior to the challenges of its predecessor and the puzzle items are less interesting. Overall Hitman GO is superior and has more charm.In both games I did not enjoy the mechanic of forced movement, which forces you to go to extraordinary lengths to simply kill an enemy you're already standing near.

There appear to be no additions / extras to this PC version though, so it is a straight port, so that may disappoint some people who were looking for extras. The PC version is also more expensive than the mobile version, so that may be a factor for some.

Yes, it was obviously designed as a mobile game. It' just a really nicely done puzzle game.Now that we have that out of the way... Why do you play games? I play games for enjoyment, and I really enjoyed this game.The art and sound is very well done. I think overall the puzzle design, art and animation is pretty true to the world of Lara Croft even if it is a lot more stylized and simple than the jaw-dropping art in Tomb Raider. I played with a controller on my couch through my steam link and it was a great way to unwind for a little while. The controls were good overall, although there were a couple of times I got sloppy with the thumbstick and went the wrong direction. I'm pretty sure it was 96% user error.The puzzles are hard enough to be interesting, but not too hard  (and there are solutions out there if you get stuck). You need to realize that you're expected to die sometimes to figure out how things work. There's no penalty, so go ahead and just try that crazy idea to see what happens. The achievements aren't too onerous - I only had to retrace my steps a couple of times. The save points are well placed for the most part so you don't have to do too much tedious repetition to make it through (there was only one annoying level I can think of). I thought the optional ""hidden object"" part of the game where you click vases to unlock outfits and get achievements was a nice way to add a little more to the game without over-complicating it.I just finished the Mirror of Spirits and really enjoyed that as well. The chapter added two new mechanics that made the new puzzles pretty interesting. No new achievements, but you do get a new outfit to unlock."

You have to swipe to move from spot to spot, which isn't terrible, and I got used to it after I couldn't find any fix online. Every square you can move to has a little diamond on it, so it would be nice if the devs made it so you could just click on the diamond you want to go to. I still highly recommend the game though!"

Why on earth would you want a Tomb Raider adventure without the ability to run, jump, or shoot enemies at a fast pace? Why on earth would you want a turn based puzzle game?Once I'd worked out how to move Lara (dragging the mouse to the next square, which is tedious and could have been done so much better with arrow keys as well), I slowly got hooked.You move Lara around a series of obstacles and enemies, each with their own properties to complete the level. The introduction of different objects and moves is done very nicely (you usually get to practice something before you need it). You can collect gems and relics to unlock outfits - nice to see some of the classics back again, although some of the other choices are a little baffling (presumably the same developer is responsible for the games mentioned?).The only criticism could really be the puzzles. If you're a consummate puzzler who likes tearing your hair out at every opportunity (i.e. Hare in the Hat) then you might find this all too easy. If you want a fairly casual game with some fairly intuitive puzzles which will nevertheless take you a couple of tries to get right, then this is for you.A bit of a bizarre departure for Lara, but one I really quite enjoyed."

Each level is divided into a grid, and you move Lara one space at a time. You’ll need to pull levers and push stone pillars to weigh down pressure plates to trigger moving platforms and open doors, while avoiding giant spiders and snakes, crumbling floor tiles, boulders and arrow traps.The good-	Most of the puzzles are intelligently designed. Solving them gave me that “I’m the smartest guy in the world!” feeling.-	The last couple of chapters get quite complex and challenging, without feeling frustrating.-	The game does a good job of teaching the player the rules.-	Every level has hidden gems and relics to find.-	It took me 8 hours to finish each level and find about 80% of the hidden loot, which represents good value for money.-	I didn’t suffer from any bugs or crashes.The bad-	Occasionally the puzzle mechanics don’t make sense with real world logic. You aren’t allowed to simply wait or stand still for a turn, which has an impact on some of the later puzzles that have a timed element. Also, Lara’s guns can only be used in very specific situations (you can’t shoot an enemy that is more than 1 tile away). Sometimes you can’t move to a tile that is next to the one you’re standing on, just because there’s no line on the floor connecting them. Of course there’s always a solution, but you have to be willing to accept that you can’t do the obvious thing and find a way to work within the limitations of the game’s rules.-	I would have really liked an undo move option. Sometimes I’d get almost to the end of the level and realise I’d made one simple mistake which made the level unbeatable, and I’d have to start again from the beginning.-	If you get totally stuck, there is an option for a “hint”, but this actually tells you the solution to the entire puzzle rather than giving you a small clue.-	No story or dialogue. I need more Camilla Luddington!-	Keyboard and mouse controls are horrible. You move by clicking and dragging, which is probably an attempt to recreate the feel of a mobile phone touch screen. You can’t use wasd or arrows or any other keys to move. After a couple of levels of that abomination, I switched to using my 360 controller, which actually controls how you’d expect a game to control (push the stick to move in a direction, use A/X/Y to interact with objects).The recommendationIf you enjoyed the puzzle solving aspects of main franchise games like Anniversary and Underworld, and you own a gamepad, you should enjoy Lara Croft GO."

,Recommended,540840,30378168,Posted: 7 March,all,SalumoN,"Lara Croft GO is a puzzle game, that was ported from mobile devices. Surprisingly, it runs well, and even though it was made for mobile devices, the gameplay suits the PC well. One could argue whether there is a story or not, but for the most part there are only puzzles.The puzzles are interessting, and get progressivly more difficult as new elements are introduced, and later combined. So if you are into puzzle games, you might want to give it a try. For the most part the puzzles are smart, and as long as you are somewhat smart you should be able to clear the main game pretty easily. The DLCs however ups the difficulity a notch, however, should you get stuck, you should know there is a hint system in place.I do recommend the game, but I do dislike the fact that some of the more difficult puzzles can't be solved in multiple ways. In the beginning it's all about understanding how the mechanics work, and putting them together to solve the puzzles. This feels great, but towards the end of the game, it seems like you need to solve the puzzle the exact way the developer made it. It seems it's more about timing the boulder and the creatures rather than solving a genuine puzzle. One misstep, and you need to restart. This will lead to some frustrations. Except for that it's a decent game. Pick it up at a sale."

Overall a very enjoyable experience.PROS:* Challenging - The mechanics start simple enough, maybe even too easy, but as the game progresses some of the puzzles are quite challenging. In terms of difficulty, there’s plenty of “meat” for die-hard puzzle fans like me, but there’s also an in-game hinting system if you’re looking for a more casual experience. (I didn’t try the hinting, so can’t comment on it further.)* Atmosphere - The graphics and sound effects are spot on. They create a captivating ambience without being distracting.CONS:* User Interface - The game was clearly a port from a tablet game and a tablet is still the ideal medium to play this game. With a mouse it’s click-and-drag to move Lara to each space, which is tiring considering the amount of movement. Movement with the stick of a game controller is easier, but at times didn’t feel precise enough. I mostly used a controller, but there were a few places where I switched to a mouse, when I found using the controller would send Lara down a different path than the one I intended.OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:* Short - I was able to 100% the game in under 10 hours. The puzzles don’t change, so there’s not much replay value. It was a satisfying experience that didn’t feel incomplete, but the length nevertheless ought to be a consideration before purchase."

Moreover, an easy-to-use official guide to solutions is also provided in the game itself.

First a mobile game, then translated to PC, using the mouse as a finger touching the screen, this is a puzzle game using the Lara Croft theme.  If you played Hitman GO, you know the puzzle type.  It plays more like a board game, where you have to get to certain places at certain times with certain items.  Boards are set up a certain way so that there are really only one solution.  It's not action-oriented like Lara Croft games, but pretends to be.  Animals only bite you if you're next to them or on their turn.  So it's mostly moving your Lara Croft piece in the right sequence.  I enjoyed it, though one of the bonus levels is much harder than the game itself.  Two bonus levels are included as of this writing."

Themed after Tomb Raider, you will send Lara through various challenges to find treasure and avoid hazards. This was a relaxing game for after a long day of work with challenging but not terribly difficult puzzles (aside from the last two bonus missions, those were tricky!)The controls were simple enough once you figured out how to move lara to begin with. I assume it's based off the mobile version as you have to hold the mouse and drag in a direction then let go to get lara to move a block. It was responsive and I didn't find myself accidentally killing Lara by dragging the wrong direction more than once or twice.I got it for $3.39 on sale and I got about 7 hours out of it, taking my time to find the collectibles and not using the puzzle hints to rush through.
