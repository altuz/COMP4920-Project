,Recommended,540880,29173547,Posted: 10 January,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"This little romance visual novel (girl x boy) is so charming. It’s really sweet(even tho the MC has never been kissed before and she’s kinda innocent), and even if the routes are short, they surely are amusing. Rosemary is a nice MC, and her haircut is the cutest thing ever.8/10, if you’re looking for a short yet good visual novel, with a simple and heart warming story. I recommend getting this title on a sale tho, since it’s a bit expensive. The art style is great, just like the BGM.Also, Prince Kuya stole my heart. What a cutie pie!"
,Not Recommended,540880,28951368,Posted: 2 January,all,Lucy,"Rose of Winter is a somewhat charming but shallow visual novel.  There are 4 main routes, each with a good/bad ending.  While overall I enjoyed the game, I have a hard time recommending it at a $12 price point.  If you can get the game on sale, it's a bit of an easier sell for me.I have about 4 hours of gameplay, and that netted me every achievement in the game save one (that required playing a route 5 times).Pros:- I enjoyed the art style- Rosemary is generally charming- Game ran smoothly and I encountered no typosCons:- Most routes start with the love interest being a jerk to the player and then quickly flip around- ""Falling in love"" happens within the span of a few lines of text and often feels abrupt/fake- No epilogues or ending list- No CG gallery, which seems like a basic feature of most visual novels- In many of the routes, the distinction between the choices the player must make to achieve the good/bad endings is non-obvious.-On another note, I wish this game didn't play into the ""inexperienced/innocent heroine"" (literally never been kissed) and ""experienced hero"" trope."

I also liked the soundtracks, especially the one from the beginning, very nice ! And the art is really cute too !My fave story mode is the one with Kuya. And Kuya is my favourite. And I really like his long hair and his tough look(long haired guys ftw <3)And plus the sweetest one in my opinion ! I kinda melted when he suddenly became shy, that was so adorable ! *.* I've really loved the Kuya story mode that much that I think I'm gonna play it again x'DThe game was a bit too short in my opinion. I wanted to play more to be honest. :( And also a bit expensive(I recommend buying it when it's on sales ! )"
,Recommended,540880,26097423,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,Yakistar,Very cute for such a short game. Rosemary is such a sweetie.  My only disappointment was that there was no CG gallery and no epilogues like most visual novels have. But these are minor and I can live without them.
,Not Recommended,540880,26233242,"Posted: 26 October, 2016",all,Kruewella,Don't get me wrong.  I enjoyed this game.  But I finished the game and got every achievement in 4 hours.  That's crazy for an $12 game.  That alone is what prevents me from recommending this game.    Maybe wait until it goes on sale or something.
76561198026571495,Recommended,540880,26098986,"Posted: 18 October, 2016",all,Fuyu21,"Overall it was 4 short cute stories bundled up into a game. I had a few graphical errors in Falkner's route and a few audio glitches when skipping to get the sad endings but it wasn't too bad. My favorite story was Crow in the end although I played in the order of Tirune, Kuya, Crow, and Falkner. I think for how short the stories were I wouldn't recommend paying $12 for it, even if I bought it at a 15% discount for $10.19. I've played other visual novels that cost around the same but lasted me at least a full day of playing to complete entirely. I did like the characterization of the Heroine the best though. Rosemary was just 'strong is the new cute' in your face with a dorky but relatable personality. If you're interested for a few short cute stories with ok art then I recommend playing this, but hopefully the glitches I had and the price will adjust for what this ended up as. As an otome game I still promote it as this genre doesn't have enough love in the english language."
,Recommended,540880,27603274,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,qumage,"Rose of Winter is a short (a single playthrough of one storyline lasts about an hour), earnest visual novel about a romantically inexperienced, though not naive, young knight, escorting one of four attractive young princes across a treacherous, snowy mountain. The writing is good, the experience is touching, and the art and music are just right for the experience. Some people will never enjoy a story about a sweet young woman falling in love for the first time with hot mystical men. For everyone else, please buy this game.Magnolia Porter (the writer) and Aatmaja Pandya (the character designer) have created compelling characters, thanks in no small part to their nuanced treatment of femininity. The main character, Rosemary, is a large woman, who is aware of her size and how it is perceived, but the writing never dwells on that. She occupies a masculised social role (that of the physically competent chivalrous knight), but is not ashamed of her femininity. In fact, she keeps her hair fluffy, her armour has pink highlights, and she is very naturally a sweet and nurturing person. She is hired to protect men, and sometimes they take issue with her role, but never because she is a woman. Though I have my favourites, the four princes are all interesting people, and none of the four main plot arcs are predictable.Mechanically, this is a standard small-scope visual novel. There is a lot of text, with the occasional dialogue choice. Most of the time, you're watching Pandya's full-body character illustrations emote over beautiful backgrounds by Victoria Grace Elliott, but for tense or intimate scenes, the scene cuts away to a full illustration. There are something like six music tracks, and I think the stirring ones move me more than the tender ones do, but they're all lovely. The animation involves simple digital manipulation of the assets. A couple of scenes involve characters navigating across a river, carrying each other, or fighting. It is possible to do this very poorly in visual novels, but the movements here are very smooth.This game will make you feel cute. You can romance a very pretty dragon boy and the colour palette kind of reminds me of fondant. Please take a few hours out of your life to play a little game made by a small team of artists who really care about their craft, and want you to share a story of burgeoning love between mutually respectful individuals whose fantasy lives subtly reflect the complications, little injustices, and real feelings of the real world."

Fortunately, there's a bunch of princes in need of escort across Mount Needle who notice and appreciate your cuteness, strength, and quality of character!I've only done one playthrough. Now very much looking to try the others! The romantic encounters are well-written, tasteful, but still tittilating.

,Recommended,540880,33137269,Posted: 2 July,all,FortAngel,"A cute little short otome game. My favorite thing about this one is that the heroine is more well-defined than in most other games in the genre. Rather than being largely a cipher, she's an interesting character in her own right, which is enjoyable. It's quite short - I finished all four routes in a couple of hours - but I enjoyed the cute art style and the fun genre subversions.If you like this kind of game and you're looking for something you can play through in one sitting, give Rose of Winter a try."

,Recommended,540880,31536208,Posted: 3 May,all,♥ Waddles ♥,"Rose of Winter is a romance based visual novel that gives the reader 4 different suitors to choose from. Each suitor follows a different storyline and shows how the main character, Rose, grows and experiences her first love. This is one of the sweetest little VNs I have read in a while. It will warm the cockles of your heart and maybe even make you shed a tear. For how short each story is, you really get attached to the characters. I can see people being turned off by either the art style or how varied each storyline is, but I think that it is one of its stronger aspects. My only main complaint is how short each story is!Pros+ Beautiful art+ Varied storylines+ Atypical romances+ Memorable charactersCons- A bit on the shorter side- Some of the romances are a bit rushed- You might need some tissuesOverall, I think it would be worth your while to check out this VN, if otomes or romance novels are your thing!"
,Recommended,540880,30604191,Posted: 18 March,all,t. mike,"I bought Rose of Winter based on the cuteness of its artwork. The heroine, the four princes, and the world were all drawn with maximum adorable-ness. The player takes on the role of Rosemary, one tough lady and a wannabe-knight who is hired on to protect one of four handsome princes traveling through the snowcapped mountains. Each prince offers their own unique story of atypical romance (or sadness, depending on player choices). The stories are braincandy, to be fair, but take after the cute artwork — Rosemary is a hilarious and fun lead to play as, too.Rose of Winter was also created by three minds familiar to the webcomic scene: Magnolia Porter of Monster Pulse, Aatmaja Pandya of Travelogue, and Victoria Grace Elliot of Balderdash. The soundtrack is also created by Toby Fox, the developer responsible for 2015’s indie hit, Undertale."

It's a quick story, but offers at least a couple of play-throughs--and I love the art style. The heroine of the story is adorable and strong at the same time, and despite the relatively brief period spent with other characters you get clear-cut portraits of personality and relationships. A great otome-style game that manages to avoid some of the more unsavory aspects familiar to the genre."

,Recommended,540880,28002500,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,WaxedPaper,"Visual novels are a, pardon the phrase, novel idea. They tend to trend towards tatty smut. Which is fine if that's what you're into, but the story telling elements in most leave something top be desired. On top of that, the payoff tends to take a little too long to get to the climax.""Rose of Winter,"" however, is more like a little short story collection than an actual novel, which is refreshing. Instead of playing different love interests against each other, or trying to balance them, each presents a different version of the same premise: escort a hot dignitary over a treacherous mountain pass. And the fantasy setting allows for unique characters.Also, Rose is just adorable, and the art is impeccable. How this game hasn't found its way to cult status yet is beyond me."

The graphics fit the tone and whimsical nature of the characters really well. Rosemary, the heroine, is an absolute joy to play as and I loved all four romance options and ending options, even when some of them got me a bit choked up.Four romance options, each has a 'good' and 'bad' ending though I'd say it is a lot closer to bittersweet then ever truly bad. I read a bit faster then the average so I'd say it takes about 45 minutes to an hour to see both endings per romance so about 4-5 hours total if you want to get all the achievements (which are worth it for the easter eggs alone).I bought this during a major sale so for 50% off. I felt like that was well worth the price, but I don't personally think their is enough variation for it to be worth a double digit price tag. I would have gladly paid more then I did, but not the original asking price for what I got.Overall though I highly recommend it. It touches on many of the most common archetypes and tropes and does a wonderful job of making you smile and enjoy the subversions, inversions and tongue-in-cheek simple sweetness of the main heroine.10/10 Would climb Mount Needle with Rosemary any day."

It's a sweet, short, comforting set of love stories that now lives permanently on my hard drive to replay whenever I need a pick me up.Rosemary is a goshdarn delight, good at her job but frequently awkward and always adorable.The boys are fun and varied, and the road to romancing each of them is VERY well written and designed. In most other otome games, the choices tend to be either obvious or frustratingly arbitrary. In Rose of Winter, the choices hit that sweet spot in between: logical but not blatant. I got it wrong sometimes, but when trying again and really thinking over the guy's values and worldview, in hindsight it would make perfect sense.Something that was surprising but REALLY welcome was the total frankness with which this game treated sexuality. Now, this is NOT an adult game, nothing shows up on screen past PG. But I've gotten depressingly used to otome heroines never being allowed to WANT sex or think about sex or have sex be anything other than something that happens TO them. Rosemary, bless her FACE, Rosemary has a LIBIDO! She thinks about things! She asks for things! She RECEIVES THINGS THAT SHE ASKS FOR! Get it, girl!This is a bite sized game, but given how MUCH I enjoyed it and the number of times I've replayed favourite scenes from my favourite route (BEAST PRINCE IS BEST PRINCE), I consider it well worth the money."

The art is adorable and the writing is solid if not inspired.  But the graphics are often glitchy (often giving a patchy purple background separate from the character sprites even after re-downloading), and the game itself is incredibly short.Truthfully, the game's quality is comparative to many free ""nano"" games out there--amusing for an hour or so, but not quite professional quality.  If the game were completely bug-free or the story a little longer, I'd recommend it with less hesitation.Indeed it seems too short to really qualify as a visual novel, in my opinion. . . maybe a ""visual sort story?""  Also had an issue with some of this games' ""choices.""  I don't know why games think choosing ""left"" vs. ""right"" is good gameplay, but that's a grievance I've had with numerous vns.If you enjoy similar games, Rose of Winter may be worth purchasing if you're not especially nitpicky and simply want a little romance.

Unlike most of these type of games the protagonist, Rosemary, has a face and personality. I like that she has a ""nonstandard"" body type and that she is kind, but can be firm when she needs to be, strong but knows when to be gentle. The progression is fairly the same in each route (get prince from point A to B), but each follows their own arc.  For instance I love thatKuya learns to respect/trust Rosemary and that being weaker than someone doesn't mean you can't be respected (he started out as such an edgy brat, but I loved him).I also like that you don't have to be nice to the princes if they act rude in order get the good endings.Slight crit: I may be spoiled from a different indie game (Seduce Me The Otome), but I wish there were non ""intimate"" routes that still led to good endings.My favorite prince so far is Kuya.

You won't be missing anything outstanding if you don't play it, but it's an appropriate pick as a starter otome game for those who've never played visual novels before."

I love that Rose is a bigger girl, a tank, if you will. She's strong, resourceful, and I like her character. I liked all of the available paths, even if they seemed a bit short. My favorites were Tirune, Crow, Kuya and Falkner last cause he was a jerk.You can read more in my blog here:http://pajamagaming.blogspot.com/2017/01/rose-of-winter-for-pc.html"

It's such a cute game, with positive messages about gender and prejudices, and adorable art to go along with it. The stories themselves are very linear, but with interesting twists that genuinely surprised me."
,Recommended,540880,29017481,Posted: 4 January,all,Kat Tales,"Rose of Winter is so cute! I bought it on sale because I finished Hustle Cat and wanted something similar.Rosemary is precious. I adore her character design and want to thank the creators for making a lead female who's plus sized, has messy hair, and possesses an upbeat attitude. I think Rosemary is relatable and will win the hearts of most players. The princes are standard cliches (strong type, rogue type, playboy type, mysterious type) but they all have personality and don’t necessarily fall flat because they’re stereotypes. Witty dialogue and fun flirty moments abound, I’d recommend you get this game on sale because it can be finished in a relatively short amount of time."

76561198072585625,Recommended,540880,33194845,Posted: 3 July,all,egglipse,"It's short, but very cute.The benefit of shorter routes in otome is that you can focus almost strictly on the back-and-forth between characters without it becoming tedious. I liked all the bachelors, which is rare, and thought the writing made Rosemary's connection with all of them very believable.Rosemary herself is really cute, from her personality to her design.I like the style of the artwork, but I think there's room for improvement skill-wise. I think there was a disconnect between the CG style and the in-game, but I still liked both.Overall, I'd like to see more from the publishers. As an otome veteran, I find the variety of personalities in Western bachelors to be increasingly more interesting than the traditional Eastern counterparts."

Definitely worth checking out, though multiple playthroughs are recommended. Getting the good endings for some characters isn't as easy as you'd think.Also, the soundtrack is awesome."

Rosemary is a big-hearted knight who's not above a bit of romance while freelancing. It's something of a guilty pleasure to play  - if you enjoy feel-good webcomics, be sure to look up her work!"
,Recommended,540880,29210745,Posted: 12 January,all,darksiren,"Rose of Winter stands out among visual novels I've played because I particularly enjoyed the protagonist. She wasn't a damsel in distress, she wasn't overly apologetic or shy, she had aspirations beyond just finding a guy to get married to, and she definitely had faults.I also found all of the romance options fun to read about because they were so unique, and in some cases even surprising. I would say Kuya was actually the most ""normal"" so that should tell you something about the rest! :) In some paths there's even questions about ""well, how is that going to work... physically?"" that adds some spice and humor to the romance.Unfortunately each path is rather short, but at the same time, each is also a separate story. I wish there were more CGs because I adore the art style! But these are small gripes for me. If short play time bothers you, then wait until Rose of Winter is on discount (I bought it, rather fittingly, during the winter sale!)"
,Recommended,540880,29262708,Posted: 14 January,all,Jericho East,"I'm writing this having just succeeded on completing all the Achievements. I'm quite sure you could do it faster than that, but even with a Guide I had a very difficult time getting Kuya's Sad ending, of all things! Boy will just not let go of me ...Anyways, if you enjoy visual novels/otome games, then I give this one my highest recommendation. The heroine is smart, resourceful, and holds her own in a fight, which is a nice change. Written and helmed by Magnolia Porter (whose work I was introduced to through her webcomic Monster Pulse), it has a nice pacing, interesting scenarios, and unique heroes. Whole dev team does a fantastic job of taking these male characters, who you wouldn't necessarily imagine as being romantic interests, and sells you on them in a way that feels genuine and earned instead of pushy.But instead of rambling on, let me break it down for you:PROS- Fantastic use of setting (you never see Mount Needle the same way twice)- Unique heroine and heroes, all with distinct personalities (all-around excellent writing)- Nice use of music; although there are recurring themes, they aren't overused to the point of grating on the ear- High quality of illustrations (characters are all very emotive, CGs are beautiful)CONS- I understand WHY they made Rosemary an innocent, it makes sense within the narrative, but I agree with the others who have said that the whole ""never been kissed"" thing has been done before. And it makes the other, er, 'intimate developments' feel surprisingly rushed.- Watch out for that fast-forward button! You can turn it on, but unless you've set it to stop when you reach unread dialogue, it won't stop on its own.- No 'Back' button, though a judicious use of the Save feature somewhat made up for it. Sometimes the dialogue choices are too similar or too vague, and you don't realize you've selected the opposite of what you meant to until Rosemary blurts out something bizarre.- No CG gallery. It's not the end of the world, but the illustrations are so lovingly rendered that it seems a pity.- Nothing in-game keeps track of which endings you've completed. Again, not the end of the world, and you'll only care if you're trying to save yourself some time while collecting all the Achievements.IN SUM: If you've wished there were more romantic VNs/otomes on the market, consider this a temporary answer to your prayers. I really hope that Rose of Winter is successful enough that we see more like it, both by this developer and by others."

It doesn't try to emulate an anime sort of art style and stands strong for it. (Kuya has my favorite expression!)Music: 8/10! All composed by Toby Fox, which is cool! Though it sounded generic at times, the music fit the different moods in the game appropriately, and were still a pleasure to listen to.Story: 8/10! It's a short visual novel, but doesn't feel cheap or shoddy. Of course it could be more deep, but, again, it is one of the shorter novels. I felt affection for each character, it wasn't forced, and I looooved the main character! She's such an adorable, fearsome knight! I would definitely buy from the writer again.(Also my favorite route is Kuya's!)"

This game has four princes to choose from, each having a good end and a bad end. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to games like this, so I got all the endings and achievements! I liked all the princes, but my favorite had to be Kuya! He was super cute! That being said, each route isn't super long.

She's such a nice change of peace from your usual visual novel heroine, who's bland and uninteresting in order to allow the players to project better or for the game to focus on the boys. She's really sweet and funny and I found cheering for her every route - whenever I got a bad ending, I wasn't sad because the guy broke my heart, but because ROSEMARY was sad and heartbroken.11/10 would suffer through all those bad endings again just to make Rosemary happy. But where's the route where we kiss her?!"
,Recommended,540880,33133126,Posted: 2 July,all,erinbutt,"Very cute. Omg, so cute. I liked Rose so much, she's so much more fun than the flat heroines in most VNs... Oh, and the guys were good too (jk, they're great).The conversations are dynamic, the characters and BGs move around the frame which sets this VN apart from most.My only complaint would be that it's short. Not in the way where you'd feel ripped off or like the story wasn't complete, in the way where you just want more because it's so good.Also, a way to view and collect CGs would be nice, since right now there is no way to see what CG's you've seen (maybe screencap 'em if you wanna keep 'em).Anyway, it's worth a go, it's just adorable."
