The free game niche has stepped up in the quality department and as a consumer you get a better experience elsewhere for 0$."

I'm a fan of Krampus and finding out there was a little horror game about it, it made me very happy to buy this because the price was cheap and it looked interesting. Sadly, I was wrong. The game is very buggy; I fell through the map 4 different times in dark places I could not even see and it takes forever to highlight an item and pick it up. The game is VERY dark, so dark I had trouble finding the shovel in the very first level and trying to get my bearings later on. I cannot recommend this game due to bugs and an overall relatively boring experience. I never felt threatened or creeped out other than one jumpscare that slightly startled me."

I highly recommend you do NOT buy this game as it is currently super broken and needs alot of fixing.There is nothing i can say that is good about this game from what i have managed to play, (spawn into game after long loading time, have to click T to view 3 objectives you do all 3 objectives and walk inside and game crashes every time)."

Game crashed on me twice. I beat the game in about 30 minutes and was confused when I did because I thought I just died or something. Title menu didnt even work after I beat it until reset. I understand its a small game but even at the low price I feel it should be a little lower. One major flaw I disliked was that the sound affects (or there lack of) were not good quality at all.
,Not Recommended,541100,27371136,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,GiraffeMystic,"Game has no way to adjust keybindings that I'm aware of and the controls themselves feel messy and clunky. The overall lighting is aweful and it takes forever to find a toy plane hiden in an obscure spot. Way too dark with no way to adjust the lighting.  Keybinds where c for crouch, e for action, and w-a-s-d for movement. Mouse for looking/ view. Although it sounds simple enough, it bothered me enough to mention it.The overall design of the levels/ areas seem laughable. You start out with an oddly designed, but rather nice looking house and then from there it just goes downhill. I say this because you seem to spend the vast majority of the game wandering the house and the house is just so ridiuclous. The basement desgin is so ridiculous that if it was real I would first facepalm, and then suggest moving in homeless people to live there because of how unecessarily large and maze like it is. This house designer is cray-cray no joke.As for Krampus the monster, he feels uneventful and not scarey. I'll get bored wandering around lost in the dark before he shows up and then when he'll show up randomly its just like ""oh, hi there Krampy"". First few times felt jump-scare like, but its only jump scares and those lose effect after a few times of it being repeated. His image itself was not at all scarey, in real life maybe, but a game? Nope. I've had better jumpscares from Slendy (SlenderMan) to be quite honest, and he's super underated.Lots of run around pick up a key then run around some more to find another key and then another and so on. This gameplay got repetitive and boring very fast. Theres a few other puzzle types, but the bit with the keys felt very heavy. I stayed playing for the story.Story seems to be alright, but I only just made it to the attic stairs when my entire game crashed. Which was a bit of a buzzkill, even after being frustrated with the very poor lighting and annoying key binds. I'm now stuck in the attic, mkay.TLDR:No tutorial, so good luck learning the keys and what to do.Poor key bindings and no options or way to adjust any part of the game be it lighting or key binds.The lighting is terrible and theres no way to brighten the game to look for objects/ objectives, which are, by the way hidden in obscure and dark little nooks and cranies.The gameplay is repetative. Its basically find a key and find a lock for said key, then continue to find more keys and more locks after some point. Lots of find said object and goto said location with said object.Areas are designed in weird and crazy ways which don't make any sense to me.Cheap jumpscares that even Slenderman can do better.Maybe worth a shot if on sale or cheap in general, but the lighting and key binds need improvement, as for the jumpscares, well have you ever played Spooky's House of JumpScares? Yea, and it almost feels kinda rushed in some aspects. Is it just me or is this game super short and relatively easy? The game isn't very bad, but its not very good either."

Managed to crashed through the kitchen floor and died.... after waking up and trying to open a closed door the game freezes as welllSave checkpoints also don't work properly. Also the game is much to dark...Pitty as the idea is fine - though the developers didn't test too much in my opinion to remove bugs
76561198048974498,Recommended,541100,26131362,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,rjmacready,"No options. Constant crashes. Infrequent saves. Long load screens. A completely lame ending. So why am I thumbing this♥♥♥♥♥♥up, exactly?Well, it is kinda creepy. Which a horror game should be. And it delivers the occasional effective ""jump scare"" which, no matter how much people like to belittle them, actually take some skill to execute correctly. It also has one halfway-decent ""puzzle"" idea, and a couple of other ""puzzles"" which at least aspire to a challenge greater than opening a cupboard and finding a key inside (though there's plenty of that, too).Oh, and when you press the keys on a piano, instead of the requisite piano sample we all know and love from other first-person games, you get a blatant plinky-plonky ELECTRONIC KEYBOARD sound instead. And that's just sheer genius in my book.Look, it's no kinda masterpiece, and five bucks really is taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥for a cheap♥♥♥♥♥♥indie game that lasts barely thirty minutes (maybe a smidgen over, if you crash frequently enough). Only buy if you're hard-up for a horror game and it's on sale for less than a buck (so maybe wait for the Christmas, rather than Halloween, sale). Done deal.Verdict: 5.5/10 (the extra .5 being for the plonky synth sound. GENIUS, I tell you)!"

I hate to say bad things about games but I can’t dress this game up to be fancy and amazing. The beginning was okay you know the whole get these things done then something bad is going to happen vibe but it didn’t really get any better, had a couple of jump scares that got me but other than that there isn’t much to it, the story wasn’t bad & the game crashed once but...The biggest disappointment for me was the ending, no spoilers but it’s really not what I expected..Would I recommend the game? Only if you want the trading cards to get another badge & if you do want the game then I would wait until it’s on sale. I got the game on sale & now I’ve played it I’m glad I didn’t pay full price.If you would like to see what the game is like feel free to watch my play through.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-TEVaLz8tLLXkXG8hhR_aH_8GZ7Axbbp"

Krampus mostly consists of finding keys and unlocking doors while encountering standard jump scares and spooky notes in between. It may not be anything special, but it's well put together for $5.Quick Look:https://youtu.be/iB8VoterjOs"
,Recommended,541100,29075486,Posted: 6 January,all,Nokturnalb6six6,Was an ok little game for the 1.98 or whatever it was I spent on it. few little jump scares and some easy puzzles. it is what it is.
76561198086542708,Recommended,541100,26111422,"Posted: 18 October, 2016",all,UnimaginativeHandle,"...this Developer is getting better.There are ads in this game for Wooden House & Whispers which I've played & they were barely okay, slow burn 'horror' that never actually burns, which is a nice way of saying that I found them boring overall.Whispers was glitchy & crashed on me a lot.Evidently Wooden House isn't one of the games by this Developer so I've removed the critiscism that was previously here, Case 8 which is the game I'd forgotten about, I recall thinking that it showed promise but from what I remember I got stuck in one of the puzzles & then moved on & didn't go back because despite seeing promise, I wasn't especially interested by the tasks I'd completed so far in that game.This...I got to the cutscene for 'going to Father's Office' which the game tells you is close to where it ends & it crashed; I was wondering when that was going to happen.I haven't check what order the games from this Dev have been released but if it is Jackal, Case 8, Whispers & then this; they are definitely getting better.This is still a pretty bland, mainly 'collect keys' & a couple of notes with a couple of environmental puzzles & tasks like 'collect 7 toys' or 'drink milk & cookies before going to bed' which are different enough, but you are basically looking for substitues for keys in a not annoyingly dark environment.Some stuttering from possibly misplaced load triggers & as I say it crashed during a cutscene; but marked improvement.It's one of those games where I wish there was a sideways thumb, $5 might be a bit high for the content as I'm pretty sure it be under 30 minutes when I bother to finish it.Yeah, I'll go with recommend; the Dev is improving; still isn't an interesting game content wise, might want to check back in a couple of games time; but improvement.But honestly, sideways thumb."

Creepy atmosphere.  $5, but I bought mine on sale.  Can't say that I'd be cheesed off if I had paid $5.  If in doubt, wait 'til it's on sale.After I installed the game initially, it wouldn't start.  Left a message on the forum.  Next day, the game started fine.  Maybe dev's released an update(?).  Not sure, but it worked fine after that.  No bugs.  No crashes.  (Running Windows 10 64 bit.)Short game.  Not a whole lot to it.  Roam through dark creepy house.  Find keys & other objects.  A couple of easy puzzles.  Spook pops up here & there.  Weird ending, but I think I get it.House scenery is very dark, but it's supposed to be.  Adds to the atmosphere.Like I said, fun little holiday game with creepy atmosphere for $5 (or less if you get it on sale).  I liked it.  Merry Krampus ...er, Christmas!  :-)"

However, I'm at a point in the game where it has given me a few good scares, and that's what I look for in a horror game. There is a puzzle where you have to pull sheets off of mirrors  to show a compination, and Krampus is under the sheet if you choose wrong, which I thought was clever, and creepy. The atmosphere is unsettling, and I like the redition of putting Krampus into a horror game.I'm enjoying playing it, so I'd give it a thumbs up. My only complaint is that for some people, $5 may be a little steep in comparison to other games I've played for the same price.Gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARIEadr4s0Q"
