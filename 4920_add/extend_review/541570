,Recommended,541570,31010174,Posted: 7 April,all,渗透之C菌,Can't believe this game was hand-crafted by ONE person. The story is captivating and the gameplay is smooth.I'm looking forward to playing the next episode! This is the horror game that's worth waiting for. There's nothing wrong with things taking time.
,Recommended,541570,32781703,Posted: 25 June,all,Igotboomed,"Like others have mentioned. This is a fantastic game, especially considering it is done by one creator. Everything about it is amazing. I love the very dark and creepy storyline of a disfigured boy with blue hair, that is going through a very hard time, and the game has some quality surprises, leaving you very excited and invested in what happens next, why certain things happened etc. The music also is really good, also made by the creator. If you haven't yet, I reccomend buying this game and checking out a really interesting and horrific story"

Music is original and made by the creator of the game4. So far the story is amazing5.This game is very unique (in my opinion)I think this game is definetly worth a buy, but that is my opinion."

I just played this early morning and now can't waiting for the second episode.It was fun for me entering into the mind of the gamedesigner who built the puzzles, infact the walktrought wasn't frustrating or boring, it was very balanced: not too easy, nor too hard.Just some missing text in the version I played(Italian version).The game costs just 3€ in Italy.Its longevity is greater than pizza.A good pizza in South italy cost 5€.So deal with it and stop complaining about the duration of low-cost masterpieces like this.Good work to the developers! :)"
,Recommended,541570,33476237,Posted: 12 July,all,Sleepy Sheepy,"Damn, just damn, this game is everything I love, im the kind of person who put 100 hours into NITW and 65 into fran bow, so when a game like this comes out, with quirky dialouge, super interesting story/characters/ and so many secrets and the more you can actualy complete the secrets, you will learn WAY more about this game then if you just went through and beat both episodes.So far this game has huge potential, and considering only one dev made this, its downright incredible.Also Sanity Falling is the band that the dev actually created, so the music in this and assests even were created by the dev as well.Honestly if this game continues in this direction, with all the genuine dialouge, and just interesting world/level/character desing,  this will proabally end up being one of my favorite games of all time."

Wait till all of the episodes come out and then maybe pick it up. You're a man recounting his past to a psychiatrist so the game takes place in two different times as you try to piece together what happened to this kid. The art style is pretty nice, but character and background assets are inconsistent in their quality.  The sounds are pretty standard fair, but not bad.Current Grade B+"

,Recommended,541570,28369127,"Posted: 14 December, 2016",all,Lil Lady Lana,"Saw the trailer for this about two weeks ago before its release and immediately picked it up upon release.Really enjoyed the first glimpse to what I'm hoping will be an awesome game series.Some points about it to follow.-Soundtrack fantastic (Extra points for head banging)-Creepy neighbours.-Simple but interesting fetch and go quest/puzzle to start off with for episode one.-Art style is very similiar to Ska Studios games (Charlie Murder, The Dishwasher, Salt And Sanctuary)-Dialogue is very well written10/10 would recommend."
,Recommended,541570,35039518,Posted: 17 September,all,mander,"This is a self-evident work of art and  labor of love. Each little touch adds something, from the soundtrack to the realistically-written cast. The premise is believable, set in a spare and not overly-referenced mid-90s setting. The sound effects and animation are grunge but also filtered through youth; gritty but not sordid. The writing is really good because it seemlessly draws you into a role of not only voyeur, but ally for Sally Face. From episode to episode, poking around to see if different rooms and events have interactable continuity--they do! The main character is so well-rounded by now (I just finished Episode 2) that he feels like my long lost friend."
,Recommended,541570,33210530,Posted: 3 July,all,gravydiggs,"I have to say that, for a solo creator, this is a good game. It keeps your attention and you want to know more about the story.  Here are some of my initial thoughts. Keep in mind that this is just the first episode, so there's more story to be unveiled.1. It is WEIRD. The characters, the background, the imagery, the interactions, etc. The creator leaves gaps in the story (which I'm guessing will be filled in later), so you sick with the episode and want to know more. I mean, seeing a kid with bloody bandages all over his face is a pretty great draw.2. That being said, the interactions between the characters feels...stilted. The interactions are almost a bit too simplistic for the overwhelmingly serious context of the story. It throws you off a bit.I plan on sticking with it just to see where the story goes, but I kinda hope there will be a bit more complexity to the characters. Nevertheless, good job to the creator and I recommend taking a look at the game, especially for the price."

For the super low price, I wasn't expecting much, but it looked like the developer had a cool idea, so for a couple of bucks -- why not? I was super impressed. The main storyline gameplay took me less than an hour (because I am a point and click adventure veteran), but it's obvious that there is more that I can do, and I plan on playing it multiple times. The story is subtle and awesomely creepy, the art is really cool, and I'm down with the metal soundtrack. The mechanics are pretty simple, if sometimes a little bit clunky (but I don't think there's really a way to make dialogue trees not clunky). You're not spending 5 minutes trying to figure out how to pick something up, like some indie adventures. Can't wait for the next episode!"

Not really scary, not really that disturbing, but it reminds me of the strange, dream-like modern gothic novels I read as a kid. The ending made me interested enough that I'll deffo be getting future chapters.The only part I couldn't take seriously was the full minute of screamo that Sally head bangs to. You can't skip it, or do any interaction when this is happening, it doesn't add anything to the story at all, and you also don't get the choice to, like, just not listen to it. I found myself playing on my phone until the song concluded. It kinda seemed like a shameless plug for the dev's band, or the dev's friend's band, which is find, it was just awkward.The villain for this chapter is also a little 'meh'. It's now a full on trope to make bronies or mock-bronies dirty, fat, perverted middle aged men. Besides the obvious ""not all bronies"" argument, this character just seemed kinda on the nose. I'm happy, at least, that the ending implies that he might not be as guilty as we were led to believe."

I love how the game keeps you guessing from start to finish and makes you second guess your theory on whats happening around Sal. Such an amazing game, I totally recommend playing it 100% can't wait for episode 3."

Can't wait for future episodes to come out!Each character is in their own way unique, giving so much life to the story and overall game.Not to mention each episode leaves you on the edge of your seat, awaiting the next one tocome out and give you another piece of the puzzle.Also, highly recommended if you're a fan of Fran Bow. Has the same creepy theme and some-what of the same mechanics. (Though to be honest--This game has more of my love <3)"

,Recommended,541570,33531550,Posted: 14 July,all,JellyBellyBunny,"From the very first episode, I really loved the plot. Now I'm a sucker for mystery games and this game threw me right off. I really loved the game play, the characters and even the interactions! I was super excited to play episode 2 and in my mind, I didn't think it would be as great as the first one. Boy I was wrong.The strange style seems to make the game even more fun to play, and the subtle surroundings makes it seem a bit disturbing. I totally think that the price is worth it, and I can't help but thirst for episode 3 !! Good job creator, for a one man band, I think it's totally incredible!!Can't wait for more!  - JBB"

The music is freaking awesome, the characters are so amazingly well done and relatable. The gameplay itself is rather simple but nonetheless freaking ""catchy"". This is made by ONE PERSON which just blows my mind.Kinda creepy, kinda sad, and as you get invested in the story and the ""mystery"" it just gets better. I can't wait for the next part. I need to know what happens. So. badly."
