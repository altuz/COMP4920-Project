Aside from Nick and Judy, PC version still lacks a rather sizeable handful of characters, and one full playset.There is still no multiplayer.It performs better.Despite the recent update, I still find it difficult to recommend this game to anyone outside of the 'hardcore' Disney Infinity fan.With the servers shut down, the only means that PC had to multiplayer was also shut down, as was the only way to reliably share Toybox creations.As we were not given any alternative means of multiplayer, while consoles continue to enjoy Multiplayer, this is a point that I would mark against it.not everyone will be hurt by this. But as someone who enjoys playing games with my friends, this does bother me.**Edit** based on one source, it is indeed possible to play multiplayer. whether or not it's limited to the Toybox is beyond me. But evidently, all you need to do is invite your friend in through your Steam friends list. Sneaky, sneaky, Disney. **Nick and Judy are in the game, but we still lack any of the Marvel Battlegrounds content, which unfortunately locks PC away from the 100% completion bonus that consoles have.In addition, we do not have any of the 'Through the Looking Glass' characters, or Finding Dorey playset.THAT SAID,It is still a fun game. environments are a blast to explore, and the playset stages are wonderfully crafted to feel at home in their respective playset. They took great care in creating this product, and the star wars story modes are some of the best star wars games I've ever played.Ireallywant to recommend this game... but aside from the sheer amount of content you get for the price, in comparison to the Console version, I cannot recommend you buy the PC version over the console title in its current state. unless you're fine with purchasing an incomplete product.----Old Review---Evidently, when they say 'All the Disney Infinity characters', they don't mean the ones that require the patch the console versions of DI 3.0 recieved.In addition, with the lack of any real multiplayer, the experience presented here is only a portion of what it once was, seeing as how the PC's multiplayer was chopped off with the online functionality.with that, on top of MASSIVE framerate drops, I find it very difficult to recommend the PC version of Disney Infinity 3.0.Gold edition was a nice gesture. But sadly, the better experience is STILL on console.you WILL however, recieve more content for the fraction of the price.So there's that, I suppose."

Basically what they did is shut down all the Multiplayer aspects of this game and hollowed out the interactive aspects of the toybox version.  Then to appease all the PC gamers (some of who have dumped literally hundreds of dollars into playsets and the like), they release this version of the game that unlocks everything but eliminates all multiplayer and sharing in the toybox section.I am not going to go into a huge review of the gameplay itself because you can see that in my review of the original version of the game ""Without limits"" which should've read ""limited by the year 2016 afterwhich we will stop supporting your game.""Anyway, I am pleased with this generally because it unlocked playsets I hadn't purchased.  I am not so pleased because I have found at least one annoying gamebreaking bug where my game randomly brought up a windows cursor while I was playing, taking away my ability to rotate the camera, and nothing I could do would make it stop.  I had to completely exit the game.  Hoping this doesn't happen again during something important because I have little hope that Disney Interactive will do any updates at all to his thing as they said they would no longer support PC at all.So, buyer beware!  You get what you get here.  I would not buy this unless on a killer sale.I will say the Star Wars sets are a ton of fun and I almost wish they would release full, uncut versions of th storylines using their gameplay and graphics.  Way more fun than the LEGOs versions and I think rival even some of the more ""adult"" Star Wars games like Jedi Academy and so forth.  The combat plays like I with Knights of the Republic would've gone.  They have all the elements of a blockbuster game in there and it boggles the mind why they didn't leverage it better."

,Recommended,541670,31636562,Posted: 8 May,all,Darkening Demise,"I was shocked at how much I enjoyed it. How my first impression was amazing. This is the perfect game to play around with whether you like Star Wars, Marvel, Disney or all three. You can't play online and there's no local multiplayer but its fine its fun in singleplayer. You get all the content from 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 in this package to play with. For only $30! It used to cost hundreds for just a few characters and maybe a new playset! Its simple, enjoyable, child friendly, and offers plenty of content to play hours on end. Recommend for those looking for something different from all the survival, shooters, and asset flips on Steam that poor Jim Sterling is tired of making videos on. Worth the $20.09 I paid, would've gladly pay the full $30."

The Play sets are great fun and Toy Box mode is good fun too. This is one of the best family games out there and it is such a shame this will be the last Disney Infinity games although at least they went out on a high. 10/10"

Sure all the multiplayer and sharing has been gutted from the game since Disney shut down all of the on-line servers, and there are parts of the game you can never do anymore achievementwise, or just updating the facade of the arcade building so it's got color, it's just an all white lump of a building now, but there is still a ton of content that any Disney/Marvel/Star Wars fan will have hours and hours and hours of fun with."
,Recommended,541670,33862505,Posted: 28 July,all,The™ Baron,"Disney Infinity may not be a great series of games, but even ignoring what has leaked about the would-have-been fourth installment, Disney Infinity 3.0 demonstrates that it was inching rather close. The combat is very engaging, there are plenty of collectibles to look around for, the characters are very distinct from one another, and the new side-content like farming, Toy Box Takeover, and Toy Box Speedway give the game further gameplay variety.Perhaps if the series had been able to cross over characters between playsets a la Lego Dimensions, it would have lasted longer. The Toy Box Takeover mode and, to a lesser extent, Toy Box Speedway, scratch this itch to a small extent, but leaked footage of the fourth game indicate that there would have been a dedicated, seemingly full-featured crossover playset. However, just this one game on its own feels more varied than the entire Lego series I've played up to this point.The port job is very good as well, but it's not quite perfect. Like the previous games, it lacks co-op and any sort of online play. More egregious, however, is the missing content. Gold Edition is missing two playsets (Marvel Battlegrounds and Finding Dory), ten playable charaters (First Avenger Captain America, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Vision, Dory, Nemo, Baloo, Alice, Mad Hatter, and Time), and their associated power discs. If you're looking for the complete Disney Infinity experience, even ignoring online features and multiplayer, you will not find it on Steam. However, if you want to enjoy the series at a low cost, the Gold Editions are an excellent way to get in.As for the playsets, the three Star Wars playsets - Twilight of the Republic (The Clone Wars/prequel trilogy), Rise Against the Empire (original trilogy), and The Force Awakens - are all just light variations on one another. However, they are all among the best playsets in the series, offering a fun variety of combat, vehicle sections, and platforming. Additionally, unlike previous games, all Star Wars characters are playable in all Star Wars playsets if you find the right collectibles. If I had to rank them, Republic would come first, followed by Force and then Empire.The Inside Out playset demonstrates the series' versatility. It's a solid mixture of 2D and 3D platforming, with a level select screen instead of a hub world and a Bejewled-esqued puzzle minigame. The controls aren't that great, to be honest, but the levels are quite varied in their use of mechanics. These lend the playset a very distinct feeling compared to the rest of the series, even if it drags on after a while.It's not considered a playset, but I also have to give a special mention to Toy Box Speedway. It's no Mario Kart, nor is it even as good as Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed, whose devs also developed this section of the game. However, the lessons from the Sonic & All-Stars series can definitely be seen here, between the driving that has improved considerably from the first Disney Infinity and the handful of solid racetracks. Bonus points for a Gravity Falls racetrack, even if there's no playable Gravity Falls characters."

Examples are the finding dory level and characters, the playable black panther, Alice in wonderland characters, baloo etc.However there are also characters that I think should have been created like the muppets as playable characters, mary poppins, peter pan, whinnie the pooh, goofy etc.Overall it's a great game that I would love to see grow"

Sometimes restarting the game helped (and everything came back), but I finally gave up after a couple of days of not being able to get my state of the game back to functioning properly once and for all since restarting no longer appeared to be of any help.Once again, I really have enjoyed this game, but I can't recommend it when a problem like this exists. If anyone knows how to resolve the problem that I'm having, I'll gladly update this review with that in mind. I'd hate for anyone playing to suddenly have their entire game restarted just by simply logging in and out of the game.Lastly, I through running a backup and restoring the game would help, but that didn't fix it either.

76561198041513133,Recommended,541670,33658619,Posted: 19 July,all,BLU_13,"Infinity is one of my favorite series because it's a great third person open world game that isn't rated M. Before it came out I saw preorder cards and didn't think much of it cause it was a Disney game which don't have the best rep. After researching it I pre-ordered 1.0 cause it looked like it would be decent and an open world game that at the time my parents didn't have to make sure it was ok to play. I was blown away because it was actually really fun. And while 2.0 was a let down 3.0 raised the bar again.The toy box is at its best for all the features and parts you have at your disposal. Especially since the gold edition has all the power discs which really give you theme, vehicle, tool, and pack options as well as buffs and costumes.Playsets or story campaigns are the second best in the series just because 3 out of the 4 are  star wars based. While I like star wars I wish there were more properties used to widen the experience like 1.0 did. While they are similar they also have their differences which make them unique unlike 2.0 which had 2 identical play sets, same map with minor tweaks for each one. Inside out is a platformer focused one which is a good refresher.Now toy box games are good and like playsets but not locked in one property. They also show what can be done for the most part in the toy box. But they do have unique twists that make them unique and un-copyable.Now the game doesn't have mutiplayer split screen and a lot of the newer things like marvel battle grounds and the finding Dory playset and the characters released with those it is still fun.There is mutiplayer if u have friends with the game you can join each other through the friends list.The game could be even better once people start making mods for it like infinite infinity is trying to do. Which could bring the game back to life."

First of all, if you're not a massive Star Wars fan there's almost no reason to get this one anyway...maybe for the toybox, but yeah, this only includes characters from SW and Inside Out I think. Anyway, onward to the ""campaigns"".There are 4-ish, this time around.Inside Out:You play as any one of the emotions of the movie, going through about 20 or so 3D or 2D levels to collect stuff and solve some very easy puzzles. This is honestly the best of the bunch, even if it has barely any story. You just do, but at least the levels keep changing it up and get more challenging. There's a mechanic in this mode in which you have to switch to certain characters for a short time in order to solve some puzzles. Since you can freely change your character anyway, however, (without the time limit) I wonder why this mechanic is even still in there. Maybe the original game required the miniatures to be able to do so...but then again I wonder how you can beat the levels if you only have one of them...Twilight of the Republic:Hands down the best Infinity campaign to date. It follows a story loosely tied around the droid war and Grieveous. You will remember scenes from episodes 1 and 2 I think, but the story is really a bit separate and different. You can follow this story without interruptions and finish it in 2 hours or so. You'll visit Geonosis, Coruscant, Tattooine and finally Naboo. Lightsabers!Rise against the Empire:Oh boy, after Twilight I actually got my hopes up, but they were dashed just as quickly like a ship onto rocks. In Rise you ""relive"" the events of the original trilogy...in very very condensed fashion and with some minor adjustments. This one has so many issues: like how you start the game on Tattooine and have to collect 2,000 credits...by doing SIDE QUESTS! All of them basically. Go here, collect this, bring here...blabla. There's no fighting for the first hour of the game, unless you repeatedly kill the poor patrol. What were they thinking?! Then they introduce ""base building"" from Infinity 1.0 and 2.0 again...and guess what, once you're on Hoth, you have to earn credits again to purchase and place three buildings! And if that weren't enough, better do all the side quests, until new story progression missions pop up (the side quests actually progress the story, but they don't give you an indicator of that, other than you knowing that Imperial sentry droids on the surface of Hoth are a bad thing). Then you can tow AT-ATs down. Yay. When it's more fun to fight an AT-AT on foot and destroy it than to use Snow Speeders you're doing it wrong. Finally we'll get to Endor/Yavin (I forgot) and have to fight off some stoff for the Ewoks to disable the shields of the second death star...oh I forgot, you also destroy the first one...in a terrible approximation of a space sim. It's basically an on rails shooter and you can go up, down, left and right a bit...even the segments where you can freely fly around are heavily gated...there is no real 3D space...just a small canvas in which you can hover up or down...not even really fly up or down...just gradually glide. Ugh.And then...The Force Awakens:It's not as bad as Rise, but it's not very good either. You basically only relive the events of said movie, starting on Jakku...and yes, having to collect 2,000 scrap this time around...luckily you can now salvage scrap heaps to make this initial hurdle faster. After getting enough scrap, we flee from the First Order in another boring flight segment, but luckily the only such one in this campaign. Then we go to the planet, whose name nobody seems to ever recall, fight off more imperials, who are actually more of a challenge in this game than they were in any movie, and go to Starkiller base...before that we destroy a few Star Destroyers in a moderately fun space segment. Aaaaaand then we get to ""fight"" Kylo Ren...well, we don't really fight him, because we're weak and bla, so we contend ourselves with shooting at explosive barrels he tries to hit us with...in three separate fights by the way. Ugh. Han's death is neither shown nor even mentioned in the game by the way. He simply disappears after Starkiller base. Likewise some key characters weren't even included. You can see that this was simply tacked on quickly to make more money, but no actual effort was put into it.And then there's the Toybox Takeover again and the Speedway, which is just a racing mode, but with different tracks at least.Overall for the hefty price of this game I can't even begin to recommend it. You will spend about 8 or so hours completing it, yes, but most of that play time is boring or frustrating imho. Combat has been slightly improved, but that's it. I'm not even sure kids would enjoy this...maybe in creator mode."

Then I found out this game was going to have every character, playset, and power disc. I'm a bit dissapointed that this doesn't have about 10 of the characters and 2 of the playsets but it is overall a really fun and amazing time."

76561198055572010,Recommended,541670,28404119,"Posted: 16 December, 2016",all,no_linear2003,Love this game a great deal. The content in this game is very impressive for the price. From Marvel to Starwars which now Disney now owns. They really use the themes and objects with genuine love for the source material. I think every artist has dreamed of working for Disney at one point or another including me. It really has that creative Disney magic about it that I grew up with as a kid.To sum this game up via comparison if garry's mod and the holodeck and the sims had a cartoon baby this would be it. If you like open worlds that allow for infinite creativity you won't be dissapointed.The only thing I would critizize this game for is the link between the build panel and the store it would be nice if you could buy the item you needed directly from the build menu. Also you have to guess at the key commands for some of the powers. It pops up reminding you occasionally and gives you hints in the loading screens but something like the key guides in assassins creed would be much more forgiving on new players.You can have amazing fun experimenting with the visual programming in this and there are a lot of prebuilt toys that will generate random vehicles to random forests and randomized tracks for racing. There is a lot here and you will wan't to own all the toys!Recommended!
