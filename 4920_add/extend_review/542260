You can then combine these ingredients to either cook food to sell at the market/eat it, or brew potions to use/drink/sell.Potions are the main meat of the game, with 4 Levels of potions. You essentially combine other potions to make higher level potions which you can then sell and see which ones work. Drinking some of these potions can lead to interesting albeit short cutscenes.VerdictGet it if you want a nice relaxing game to play in your freetime. It's well worth the money"

Not sure how it'll do on replayability for most (potion recipes are randomized each play), but I can see replaying it occasionally in the future, myself, after I manage to beat it.  In the past I've tended to ignore experiential games, but comfy is comfy and aesthetic is magnetic.  I hope this studio makes more little games like this in the future."

Though admittedly the controls were a bit wonky/awkward to figure out at first... I had to go into the Discussions forum on Steam here to figure out some of them. But once I got them figured out, it was smooth sailin'...!A few things to note:- achievements! lots of them! this is awesome! adds more re-play-ability for nuts like me- cards to collect! yeh!!!- a few patches you can DL in the Steam Workshop including a Halloween patch, Christmas patch, rune translation patch, and *cough* nudity patch *cough* :D  (yayyy tiiits!)- great artwork!- relaxing music!- funny AF- cute and pervy- addictive! you will want to gather all the things. make all the potions.- not only can you sell the potions for $$ in the game, but you can also drink them! hilarity ensues when you nearly get molested a few times and/or turn into certain...creatures. xDSo yeah, I would hiiiighly recommend this game. I hope the devs continue to release bonus content and patches in the Steam Workshop, because I would love more!A+++!!"

Add into concoction warm and beautiful art style and lovely and then mix in an absolutely mesmerizing soundtrack - and you've gotten yourself a recepie for a comfy and quirky time killer.I highly recommend this game!"
,Recommended,542260,26621745,"Posted: 15 November, 2016",all,Nayru,"I enjoyed this game a lot. :D It basically consists of gathering herbs and mushrooms around the forest, brewing potions or cooking meals in the house, and then selling them by the shop. The crafting system is a lot of fun and keeps you hooked.It took me around 5 hours to reach the end and I haven't figured out all the recipes yet. I'm also missing a few CG scenes (which are a very nice addition to the game). There are also a lot of achievements. The amount of content is satisfying and the game feels well-polished. :) Kudos to the developers, this is a very fun and pleasant game to play."

76561198297723126,Recommended,542260,29836909,Posted: 10 February,all,darkdisciple1313,"This game is a bit tedious, to be honest, but it has enough good parts to it that I was able to get past the initial slog. Until you can obtain a few choice items (either by purchase or discovery) making any money at all is next to impossible, and money is necessary for both sustenance and supplies. In addition, the mere act of picking flowers takes energy, which gets annoying when you're trying to get enough for certain upper-level potions.Beyond that, there are some quests to complete, which involve more potion-making and finding stuff, but since that's why the game exists, there it is.There is nudity, as the game tags indicate, but it's rare and often used for humorous purposes. Only prudes and folks from certain Puritanical countries would find it offensive.The only true negative for me was that in my queues of games that might be of interest in the store page, I've recently been getting a slew of Japanese games that all feature nudity and sexuality that are not my cup of tea. I hate the notion that buying one game with a nudity tag automatically makes the Steam algorithms presume that those are ones I might be interested in. They're not.Other than that, I suppose the game is just good enough to be recommended, but only barely."

Каждая мысль, выраженная ниже, принадлежит лишь его автору(т.е. мне). Мнение автора имеет сугубо личный характер и может не совпадать с Вашим личным мнением. Обзор состоит из двух частей: художественного описания и конкретики.Купил эту игру на зимней распродаже за $2.08 (сама игра + саундреки). Не пожалел отданных денег ни разу. С первых минут игра завлекает не сюжетом, как это делало Бесконечное Лето, а именно игровым процессом. Не каждому понравится собирать травки, крафтить из них различные зелья, играть с кисонькой и прочие радости деревенской жизни. Но любители все равно найдутся (я, например). Игра отлично расслабляет, музыкальный ряд позволяет отвлечься и насладиться игрой, а встроенные рисунки с главной героиней просто бесподобны. Авторы всего этого были знакомы мне еще после прохождения визуальной новеллы ""Бесконечное лето"", поэтому я без капли сомнения отдал свои кровные за эту игру, дабы поддержать разработчиков и подбодрить их на новые творения.Теперь немного конкретики:+ Прекрасное визуальное оформление (Сюда входит рисовка спрайтов, задних фонов и ЦГшек)+ Замечательный музыкальный ряд ""на славянскую тематику"" (прим. разработчика)+ Рандомизация (Травы, грибы имеют разный эффект, а зелья могут иметь различный рецепт при повторном прохождении)+ Большое разнообразие достижений (Как внутриигровых, так и в Steam. Правда, они индентичны)+ Наличие внутриигрового альбома, в котором можно заново просмотреть все ЦГшки.- Игровые карточки Steam довольно дороги (Относится только к любителям скрафтить значок)- Рецептов зелий не так много(что-то около 27, но это, скорее всего, исправят со следующими патчами), что существенно укорачивает время игрового процесса.Итог: 8.5 Славь из 10Спасибо, что дочитали до конца."

,Recommended,542260,35175265,Posted: 24 September,all,Bearboots,"The Herbalist is a great game and I really enjoyed my time with it. I found that there was a steep learning curve and that the tutorial could use some work but overall would recommend it. I wound up writing some guides for the game as I would love more English players to give this a look (most of the guide are currently in Russian). Other than that I do want to stress that going in I expected something that was a bit heavier on the story than The Herbalist is. A tag used for this game is 'visual novel' which I don't personally agree with. There is a story for sure but I would not call this a visual novel. It's more like a crafting game built around short story to motivate you to keep going. This isn't a bad thing, it's just that if you're specifically looking for a visual novel I would check out something else."

The cooking recipes aren't very obvious, but there is an english guide and a russian guide to use. The pictures aren't detailed enough to really be porn despite the rating. The main character doesn't wear underwear or a bra, as a couple of short cutscenes show. The tentacle cutscene was really disturbing and rapeish though. Also, the developers respond very quickly to any discussion posts."

Minus the combat and time limits, The Herbalist is a charming point-and-click synthesis game. The beginning is a bit tedious and slow, but once you get into the flow of it and learn how to make a little money, you'll be in for a fun ride. Even from what little I have played so far, I'd say that it is very much so worth the price it is being offered at.You should be warned though, this game is pretty addicting; ""One more thing I need to make, one last herb I need to pick..."""

It's a cute and light story with a lot of fanservice; if you don't like that kind of thing though it's easy enough to ignore, without outside files there's no actual nudity (as far as I've seen}."

Yes, it can get a redundant and the fact that you have so little energy is quite annoying but it's quite a relaxing game and I love the art in this game. I am a little dissapointed that I cannot find any walkthroughs or potion guides online for this game. It doesn't seem to be very popular. Overall, I'd recommend this game if you like story/puzzle games. If you enjoy the alchemy/doodle god games, you'll enjoy this. If you cannot stand games that are repetative or tedious, this isnt for you."

I got this game on sale for 50% off at $2.50 and I say I got my moneys worth from it. Some of the achievments are really hard to get unless you follow a guide and even then can still be hard to get. One thing I did not like about this game is when you start a new game the plants and potion ingredients change so you have to relearn it all over again, the plants that were poison before could be needed as an ingredient the next time you play and good plants you used could end up being poison. That's what makes some of the achievments really hard to get as most wait to replay the game to get some of them as I did."

I don't think I would recommend this game simply because there isn't a lot to it. It's very repetitive, and you constantly have to redo things you have done. There are cute random photos, but the game lacks substance, I could just play doodle god or alchemist for free to get the same experience."

I have wasted three hours of my life trying to advance, improve, ANYTHING in this game. The character loses her energy at such a ridiculous rate, it's impossible to do enough of anything in a day. You need to gather herbs, search the barn, make potions, go to the store -- and if you don't eat, you don't regain your energy. Playing with the cat energises you somewhat but not enough to buy more time in the day. I bugger up every potion I try so I end up with a dirty flask. It was an impulse purchase so I guess there's a lesson to be learned here."

Only complaint I have is that not everything is that intuitive so you can spend quite a bit of time spinning wheels if you don't look up a guide. It's great for chilling out though and the story is cute too.
76561198305741403,Recommended,542260,28916952,Posted: 1 January,all,Scifiwriterguy,"This is one of those games that makes you wish for an option between thumbs-up and thumbs-down. It's not a game you'd enthusiastically recommend, but not one that deserves a downvote either.So, the deal. This game puts you in control of Slavya, a young woman who went looking to visit her herbalist grandmother only to find her gone, her cabin abandoned, and...well, that about does it for the story. So rather than A) gathering a search party, B) informing the authorities, or C) investigating the disappearance, Slavya elects to D) start fooling around with potion-making. This isn't easy, since Slavya is broke and apparently narcoleptic.In terms of structure, Herbalist is a likeable-enough recipe-puzzle game. Go find some herbs, see what they do. Odds are you've made something awful and need to try again, but that's part of the fun. For a touch of creativity, all of the plants and recipes are written in a rune-themed text which, if you have the patience, you can decode. It doesn't make a difference, but it's a nice touch.This game can get frustratingly grindy, though. The tutorial is very thin, so there's a lot of trial-and-error. It doesn't help that Slavya has less energy than a dead watch battery. You can't do much before she's ""too tired"" to consider doing whatever it is you want to do. Yep, picking ten plants just winds her. Of course, she can wake up a bit by playing with her cat, but even that's short-lived. The village shop doesn't need to stock apples - they need to carry some coffee or RedBull because this girl clearly needs caffeine in her life.It's enjoyable enough to avoid a downvote, but not enough fun to warrant a full upvote. Of course, that's just my opinion. Your mileage may vary."

You hunt down ingredients and figure out how to put them together; you also manage your resources every day. It's not too difficult, although if you want to get all the achivements you're going to have to put in some strategy and effort! The main character is cute, and there isn't much intense drama.

It's worth its asking price in my opinion, just don't expect anything more than a timesink going into this game. Essentially, you brew potions by experimenting with eight different herbs to use (four of which are unusable, 'bad', four others are 'good'. You can either sell the potions you make or drink them yourself to unlock a visual novel style cutscene. Antics ensue.Overall, I liked it. The cutscenes were fun and the art style was pretty. In the later stages of the game, the effects of a few of the potions are used in interesting ways, so that's nice."
