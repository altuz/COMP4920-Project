,Recommended,542310,29441120,Posted: 23 January,all,Spabobin,"It's ok I guess. I don't have crashing issues but I just end up at the bottom of a pit and the game ends after like 10 minutes, so it barely even feels like a demo"

I'm so excited to read what is going on next in the first Episode. That Cliff-hanger was good."

,Not Recommended,542310,29624897,Posted: 1 February,all,Xion,Quite funny but game crashed and now it won't even load up. Just a black screen with code.
,Not Recommended,542310,30024867,Posted: 18 February,all,cubic_control,It was great at first.. then the screen went black.. please fix that.
,Recommended,542310,29996332,Posted: 17 February,all,JPG UK,Very Good Game! Is very short only took me 27 minutes to complete probably shorter just because i didn't know how to save so i had to restart. I would definetally but the sequel it was fun and worth the time!

,Recommended,542310,29706988,Posted: 4 February,all,joerice1979,"A fine ten minutes or so spent getting to grips with the game mechanics, the humour and style of the game.The nearest game I've played would be ""Thomas was alone"" but this seems more personality (of your square character) rather than a story with personality, but the whole thing might be different.Quite fun, looks and sounds nice."
76561198185372353,Recommended,542310,30107708,Posted: 22 February,all,Smallfry40,"Personally, I like this game, I would recommend to others."
,Recommended,542310,29913107,Posted: 13 February,all,Kilo,10/10One of the most creative yet minimalistic games i've ever played. I cant wait for the next game and would be very upset if it wasnt released. The game has a sense of humor that i could relate to.
,Recommended,542310,30087889,Posted: 21 February,all,ŁĈƤȈȃỷɀ,"This is an awesome game, I really wanna see some more from the game! But, I found 2 bugs: In the robot boss part, the robot at the top can get stuck iniside the blocks a lot. And, with precise timing, I used a grapple cube on a yellow cube while rocket jumping up over some lava, and I glitched through the cieling. Luckily, I got into an intentional area.I have told big YouTubers such as MattShea to play this, I would recommend this to a friend. This is an amazing game!"

,Not Recommended,542310,29655202,Posted: 2 February,all,Blu Raspberry,"Escape the Game seems like it would be a fun, goofy game about helping Kevin throughout his adventures escaping the game. There is a lot of emphasis on seems, however, as the game randomly stops working, not crash in my instance, but just stops working. I really wish I could positively review this game, because I would love this game as I could actually play it. The only reason I still have it (Downloaded it shortly after the last update) is in hopes that the developer will release an update to fix it. That was November. Now is February. Don't be disappointed if it doesn't work."
,Not Recommended,542310,29642524,Posted: 1 February,all,Gaming_Guy,Im not able to get past the login screen. Looking at the trailer its a game that i wanna play but the crashing at the login screen is really ruining it for me.
76561198351960353,Recommended,542310,29772016,Posted: 7 February,all,★Vega,Great game to kill some time. I am definetly going to be waiting for the next part. Gameplay is cool and you really can get attached to kevin. Great game.
,Recommended,542310,29590312,Posted: 30 January,all,peetser pootser,"Meh..The game is good, i like the gameplay, music, the concept and everything except for the fact that it crashes after 3-7 levels every time... Which gets slightly annoying.But except for that i would recommend the game"
76561198056156734,Recommended,542310,29612528,Posted: 31 January,all,Voided Essence,"TL;DR at the endThis game is pretty cool, and funny too. The 4th wall breaking makes it even better.Gameplay wise it's pretty easy... but from what the devs at ""Insanity Games"" said, plus my personal experience at the game, I think it's pretty obvious this is meant to be a story driven game.At the time of this review, only episode 1 has been released, yet I already feel like I can't ""escape the game"" (knowwhatI'msayin'?).The cube's jokes and banter on your actions are humorous, and make liking the character that much easier.In any case, I'll stop here before I keep repeating myself.TL;DR: Funny, 4th wall breaking, story driven game that's worth your time (episode 1 is pretty short, so you have no reason not to try it out)."

76561198329582348,Recommended,542310,29864484,Posted: 11 February,all,Saki Yumehara,"This game seems like it could be really fun and entertaining as a series of short chapters or as a whole larger game, but unfortunately for me it is basically unplayable due to the frequent random crashes that stop me from getting past level 4 or 5. Despite this I still recommend it as I know these issues will eventually be fixed (hopefully) and I do think judging from the little I've played it that it could be quite fun. Overall, you should give it a try and hope it works well enough to actually get through the game. If not, you still might find what you can play enjoyable, so since it's free I'd say why not give it a try:P."
