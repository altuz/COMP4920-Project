76561197971328127,Not Recommended,542340,26153509,"Posted: 21 October, 2016",all,SodaBreadGamer,"Even though it may cost only one dollar...I still in good faith cannot recommend such a game. For starters, there is no objectives. None at all. All you do for the duration of the game is fire a slingshot, or gun, out of a window at poorly modeled characters, that look like rejects from the original Counterstrike.If you take any damage, regardless of how severe, you will hear a very loud heartbeat, which will not cease until you either heal up to full, or die. This annoying feature was in Elves Adventure, and it was just as bad in that game.The game is glitchy and enemies clip through walls as they run towards you, if they even bother to move at all. Most of the time they just stand there, even after getting hit by a rock, they just stand there. Unbelievably bad enemy A.I.With really bad games like Kimulator: fight for your destiny or Elves Adventure, at least they are entertaining, cringey, and good for a laugh, but that is not the case here. Nothing redeemable can be found in this title. No thought or planning was put into it. Level design is not existent. Would not be surprised if it was just a map from an asset pack, since it appears as if no effort went into it's creation. It has all the hallmarks of a cash-grab. Would not advice a purchase.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVP5Z9s1it8"

,Not Recommended,542340,26217811,"Posted: 25 October, 2016",all,Proxykon,"""Slingshot people"" is a First-Person Slingshooter which is essentially a measly-edited Game Guru Engine Template and a badly-performing game overall.Design & ArtBecause the game relies mostly to almost entirely on what the Game Guru Engine has in its standard asset store, which comes with buying the game maker, there is no ""unique"" art and/or design. Nothing you see in ""Slingshot people"" is heavily edited or at least transformed from its default appearance. This includes visuals, the UI and sound effects.Many people would define such a ""game"" under the infamous term""Asset Flip"", which is actually somewhat true.While pre-created templates are an easy way to circumvent difficult design work, they are merely meant as a foundation, a basis to develop your unique artstyle and/or design on (and not leech off of it, like it is currently happening all over Greenlight).Given that, the game fails to convince, impress and just majorly disappoints.Music & SoundHaha. Good one.There is no music. As mentioned above, standard Game Guru asset sound effects for everything else. Nothing impressive or out of the ordinary here. Just stale old, stale old.GameplayThe name IS the game.Yes. Mind-bending stuff right here. You are spawned in a house and will be provided with a slingshot and ammunition for it. You step towards a window. You shoot. Two shots to the body or one shot to the head kills the enemy. Some scream when they die. Some scream when they get hurt. Some try to defend themselves by shooting back at you with their shotguns or pistols, but most of them are just there, waiting for you to end their virtual existence.Did you like how stale the previous paragraph was? Get used to it,the gameplay of ""Slingshot people"" is staler as that paragraph could ever be.It boils down to walking, shooting, grabbing ammo, grabbing health.Do not bother with door keys because all doors can be opened from the start. If you are getting bored with your current location, the developer got you covered! Just look for the one room in the house that will spawn you in a new house once you enter it. There are maybe five to seven different houses and map layouts, so if you advance enough in the game, you might visit same locations multiple times. How lazy can it get?WeakpointsThere is no tutorial. There is no music. There is no unique appearance of visuals as well as UI. The gamestruggles to keep a framerate higher than 30 on any system,including mine. The developer supposedly updated the game, but given the high amount of enemies on each map, the game still lags and stutters noticeably.""Slingshot people"" has no incentive or anything appealing to its formula.Why should people play a performance-struggling game that is, boiled down, a glorified shooting range with lacking visual appearance?The game featuresglitches and bugsthat are yet to be fixed. The Steam overlay overexposes the lighting of the game. Only a restart can fix that. The achievements are not working properly. You are able to exit the house through the windows and explore the empty No-Man Land behind the scenery. Some enemies shoot, others do not. What is happening here?!Concluding ThoughtsEssentially, ""Slingshot people"" is a husk, a mere shell of a game.As lacking as it is in its content, it is just as lacking as a game overall. There is no way around that.You spawn, you shoot, you kill, you get killed. Rinse and repeat. If you are happy with doing tedious and repetitive tasks like these without getting any recommendation and/or reward for it, ""Slingshot people"" is the right game for you.As for all other people, which I would consider passionate gaming-enthusiasts, stay away at any cost. This is not even worth your 99 cents.Take your money and invest in into something like this instead:http://store.steampowered.com/app/259530/?l=englishSavant - Ascent is just double the price, but to the hundredth of fun.AddendumWorst of it all; this game was voted for on Greenlight. Steam needs some form of moderation in this process,RIGHT NOW. In an interest of keeping a storefront that is unique and diverging, I have seen too many games which do not differ considerably enough from ""Slingshot people"" getting through Greenlight lately. If husks of games are now allowed onto Steam, what will be allowed onto this platform some years later? This is setting a bad example."

The player starts inside a building.2. Picks up a slingshot and ammo.3. Enters in a room.4. Shoots at the enemies through the window.5. Leaves the room.6. Enters in another room.7. Rinses and repeats.By the way, I forgot to mention that you can also explore an ""oriental"" stronghold aside from the usual shoot through the window open-ended gameplay. That being said, Slingshot people is no different than their GameGuru counterparts: inconsistent visual art style, horrendous level design, loads of clipping issues, long loading time, poor performance, lack of context to drive the player forward, and the list goes on.A word of advice: spend your hard-earned dollar wisely!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnDLA_c9PuURating:0.1 / 10"

,Not Recommended,542340,33960841,Posted: 1 August,all,RDeDR,"TL;DR This game is very bare bones and needs a lot of work, and I don't recommend it.First, I would like to note that the developer seems to be working to improve the game. The last update/improvement announcement was 3 months prior to this review. I want to commend the developer for putting the effort into making and keeping up with their game.Into the issues I faced playing this game:1) The first thing I noticed was the load times and loading screens. The first load entering the game was several minutes long. Not much of a problem in itself, however, the loading screen is mostly blank with little design to it. Without something to look at while it performed its extended load, I was about ready to go do something else while it finished.2) When the game had loaded, I began to move over to the slingshot and ammo table when I got a notification in the game: ""Low FPS Detected. Would you like to improve performance?"" I wasn't expecting any graphical options in a game of this scale, so I agreed to improve performance. Which would have been nice if it hadn't made the performance worse. Going through the pause menu and setting the graphics to low alleviated some of the fps issues to a more tolerable level(my PC isn't magnificient, but it should be able to run this game with no problem).3) I'm going to lump combat and gameplay together for this point. Your heartbeat meter is out of 100, but I was able to get it over 600 by avoiding as much damage as possible and grabbing every health item I saw. I'm not sure if this is an intended mechanic or not. The AI is quite lacking. The enemies stay outside the buildings and shoot you through the windows whenever they have visual. I noticed that when I would move the enemies would square dance back and forth outside the window until they decided they wanted to shoot me, or I got too close to a wall where they would literally kick my♥♥♥♥♥through said wall. Your fire rate is much slower than the enemies' fire rate. Even their shotguns fire like rifles. I timed 2 shots from the sling, and it was about 4 seconds from the first click to the time the second shot left the sling. In that 4 seconds, I could be shot 6+ times from a single enemy which is about 20 damage per hit. A headshot to most enemies was a kill, but the aiming and delay of your shot(plus the urge to avoid incoming shots and the enemies' affinity to squre dance outside the windows) makes it hard to line up a headshot. I found the best course of action was to shoot the enemy body parts that clipped through the wall as they waited on either side of a window for you to poke your head out. Getting too close to spiders on the walls will damage you. The game overs don't seem to make sense unless I was missing something. Sometimes when I died, it would just restart me back at the original spawn location, and I would resume like nothing happened except that any of the items I collected were gone and the enemies I had killed were still dead. Then other times I would die, get sent back to the main menu, and have to restart at the same spawn location, but this time everything had reset.4) This is the final point I wil make. The overall cohesion of the game is strange. If you speak to the women in the levels, it seems no one really knows why you're there and why the military has KoS order on you. The start building seems to be a basic fps setup. However, the second building had two jumpscares. One being a monster reminiscent of a Resident Evil type of monster. The second simply being a doctor who appears when you open a certain door and just stands there menacingy. The real scary part about the doctor was that I didn't kill him immediately and entered the room to collect the items and when I started getting shot, he was blocing the exit, and I ended up dying."

There is nothing in the about section. When you start the game there are no objectives, no dialogue. You just stand in a house with a slingshot laying around, and some woman in skimpy clothes. People with guns try to shoot at you. Why? Who knows. If you wander into the second stage by chance, you will pick up a gun when you try to open a door, and you can't pickup a slingshot again."

The thing the developer did with this game is just use a cheap/free online game creator (Game-Guru) and when he/she finished making a vanilla, watered down, source mod 2002 game they decided to get it listed on the Steam store for $0.99. I would really recommend this game if you can do what I did and get it for $0.10, if not, don't bother. If you have a ton of extra money, however, I think you should get the game just to experience a TRUE crappy game."
