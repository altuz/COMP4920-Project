,Not Recommended,542430,26046315,"Posted: 15 October, 2016",all,CougarBite,"Quick Review:Game made using Game Guru, it is a game and you can play from start to finish through the whole 20 minutes of gameplay. Ends with a screen promising that is to be continued, should have been early access?Enemies offer no variety, all slow moving melee damage, present no challenge or skill to take down.Gameplay boils down to find a key and open a door offering little imagination.Graphics are at best “useable” but the pop in is ridiculous and animations added to sprites is minimal.In summary the game shows little effort put in to it to give you a polished product, also no imagination or attempting of game mechanics to offer you something new. No reason to buy this game or even keep an eye on the game.Long Review:https://youtu.be/y2Gx5GqOZ5A"

I bought this game simply to see what it was all about, and I could not find any story, meaning, or enjoyable moments in this game. I played it for under a half hour, just trying to get a speedrun in. Here is a full playthrough of this game, in under 4 minutes, not even close to a perfect run.https://youtu.be/FpLHR67WV7oI sadly did not recieve this product for free. DO NOT waste your money on this uncomplete, boring, pointless school project."

I praised that title on the 3rd of September while GameGuru was on sale...& here we area.The environments are relatively consistent, that's the highest praise, that recent GameGuru games have started just using the assets from the asset packs that look like they should exist together instead of the random cobbled trash that used to happen.That's it though, this is 10 minutes long, with very linear levels where you collect keys to open doors (& I will give them credit for linearity because often these maps are way too big because they haven't bothered with invisible walls but this might be too far in the other direction).There are enemies but they don't have weapons like the Rabbits With Guns asset you usually see, so you can either fire at them or just run past them, they can't get to you in time; there is one hedge maze made up of horrible angled paths that lead to the exit where you get more keys or a chest that doesn't have anything in it except for grass clipping through it & then it is To Be Continued.Content just feels absent like this is test maps for a game & given that it is apparently episodic, maybe that game will be built eventually; but it isn't now.Basically competent, but not early access when it needs to be because content for that reason this is less than an Elves Adventure."
,Not Recommended,542430,31306873,Posted: 22 April,all,Monterico Gaming TV,I do find it interesting the games that are available on steam. I think the game get's some hate because it seems like a project from some let's make a game workshop. It comes with steam cards which help offset the $1 you might spend. I would go get something off the dollar menu. Good try but if you are going to have a game like this on steam expect a backlash. Why steam gives these coupons away is dissapointing.
,Not Recommended,542430,26063177,"Posted: 15 October, 2016",all,The Wild,"The creation of this game involved neither passion nor effort. If it were free to play, it would still just be a waste of time. It took me about 15 minutes to beat the game, and in my attempted ""speedrun"" it took about 5 minutes. This is of course including the load screens, and the need to adjust the FOV after every level. This game has awful level design and contains basic Gameguru assets, as expected. It's not even impressively bad for a Gameguru game. I wouldn't even buy this as a joke gift. Here is my full experience with the game, first with my initial impressions, followed by my ""speedrun"".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieOeMl4CyT8If I had to say something good about the game, it's that it generally maintains a visual theme throughout the whole game unlike a number of other Gameguru games. The only downside to this is that the visual theme is called ""bad"". Don't waste your time here."

God help us all...I'm not even going to dignify this game or waste my time writing a detailed review, thats how bad it is, just watch the video below, I show you the whole game in 5 minutes.https://youtu.be/0X__f0gJ4hI"

,Not Recommended,542430,31727110,Posted: 13 May,all,Little fox,"Honestly the most buggy not-beta game I ever saw.About my gameplay experience:Didn't find a key shortcut to open my inventory (no tutorial or controls settings), so the door code I found (and forgot after) was forever lost.The graphics then bugged, shaders didn't work and brightness was set to maximum, everything was just white and my eyes hurt till now. There is no setting to lower the brightness, changing graphics quality, save/load, new game or quit and start game again didn't fix this bug. It also caused the border of the models to be shown incorrectly.After that, I got to the chest. Clipped and got stuck behind the box, multiple times. I also clipped over some other models, the bridge - fell down into water and died, that's why there is an invisible barrier so you cannot walk towards the water even when there is just clear grass path to it.Last thing I experienced is, that you have to find a key to the next door. There is a gun lying in front of it, and a house with a chest (I got stucked behind, as I said). I picked up the gun, opened the chest, and...- got the gun again. No key to be found anywhere (should be in the chest, or in the house, I think - instead of the gun copy).I could not continue, restarts didn't help, didn't try to reinstall the game tho. Not worth the 10 cents I gave for it. Gimme my 3 minutes of life back!"

,Not Recommended,542430,33456027,Posted: 11 July,all,Chondrite,"This is probably the worst game I've ever played.  That being said, my expectations are pretty big playing games like Civ V, CS:GO, Planet Coaster, etc.  This is a game obviously made by one person and has very limited play through.  It would probably be a good game for someone who is just starting playing PC games, with little other experience to compare.THe objective in the game is simple.  Find the key, go to the door, kill any enemies in the way.  The maze levels are very frustrating.  I started feeling claustrophobic, which is rare in a game, and ended my play experience.I got the game for $0.10 with a coupon.  I wouldn't suggest paying anymore than that for it."

Then the homeless man got a massive stomach cramp and let out the smelliest wet fart imaginable.This wet fart then decided it could do better than hang out with the homeless man so it decided it would make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game using game guru and sell it on steam, make it's fortune and finally be allowed to hang out with the ♥♥♥♥♥. Well the wet fart went ahead and did just that and this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥is the result.♥♥♥♥♥iest game I have ever bought off steam, Well done Wet fart."

,Recommended,542430,33021130,Posted: 29 June,all,_Perf,"I thought ""The face of hope: Underground"" was the best indie game ever. This game proved me wrong. Stunning graphics, amazing gameplay, and a story that you can't look away from before playing the full game. The enemies are very difficult to defeat, which adds a skill-based strategy flair to the game. I look forward to more games you create :)"
,Not Recommended,542430,33444393,Posted: 10 July,all,_Atticas_,"I think that the game is poorly made mostly because there isnt even a place to see the controls or how you play it plus there doesnt seem to be a main objective to tell you what to do.I know many people are saying ""if it doesnt have a main objective then its probably a sandbox game"" but thats not true since there is nothing to build,craft,or fight as a matter of fact.Even though I've only played the game foronly8 minutes,I dont think that the game is worth its price and that they should put more attention into actually making the game better than taking money by fooling people like me into buying it.Anyways I think that this game has potential but the developers arent trying their hardest into a game that people would actually want to play."
,Not Recommended,542430,35238889,Posted: 27 September,all,Nah,"Wow. Just wow. I play bad games, to see if there's ANY enjoyment in them.This game... Let's just say - don't spend money on it.I can't believe this is on Steam. I can't believe this is PAID.This game wasted my time, my money and my... everything.This game lagged more than GTAV, more than Crisis, more than any game I've played.How dare the developers put this in the public eye, much less ask money for it.The outlines, one thing that was part of the aesthetic, didn't even apply to all objects.There's a lake or something past the code door, the water didn't spawn and I fell to my death.Also - Why is the water an instant kill?Also - Why are there so many invisible walls?Also - Why?Just in general.0/1,000,000,000,000,000... etc.I look forward to your next game."
76561198046274038,Recommended,542430,30512446,Posted: 14 March,all,BenTumbleDryer,"Very basic, easygoing, you can do it within an hour.Could do with any variation of weapons, more enemy sounds, a control menu, a fleshed out plot or backstory, perhaps some readable books, chests that aren't empty, more textures (aside from the hedge ones for those mazes), pehraps flesh out that 'About' page, maybe some health packs better placed, fix the catapult mechanic, better enemy placement, background music, a lore of the land...Most reviews will say this game is about as fun as wiping your♥♥♥♥♥with those brushes that have those metallic hairs.Personally, for the 30p it costs... I got a lot of enjoyment out of it. I hope the creator keeps up with this project, re-visits some issues on some levels, creates progressively harder levels, and its a pretty cool world with some enemies and nice building placement that I wouldn't mind seeing some context too, even in the form of a discarded diary. Perhaps instead of being trapped in a dream, you're trapped in someone else's dream and your role is to follow breadcrumb clues to find said dreamer.If the dev keeps updating, I'll be more than happy to return. If you want an hour or so fun and you got coins lying around at home, take a chance and give this a go. Go in expecting some issues, but for me it was perfectly playable."
