,Recommended,542520,28245017,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,Dazirius,"Right. It's official. I'm a complete and total coward.I tried out ""Lost in the Rift"" this evening. It's a horror genre VR title.I knew it'd be creepy. I knew it'd have jump scares. I was certain it wouldn't be difficult from a gameplay perspective and from the look of the screenshots, I was fairly sure I'd find it had passable graphics.What I found out from my time playing the game is that I really don't like the VR horror experience. It's not that it was poorly executed, it's that it was pretty well executed.In the first scene, I'm at a campsite, by the fire, on a night so dark that anything not illuminated by the fire or by the torch I pick up very early on is just black.I could stay put, but where's the fun in that? Also, there was a noise, and there's a light in the distance. So I head to the next light. Like I said though, anything not illuminated by the torch while en route to the next light source is simply black. This leads to a nervous scanning of the surroundings. It's really quite unsettling.(It's worth noting that all the while this is going on, the player character is making a sort of terrified irregular breathing sound. This in itself is difficult to cope with emotionally.)I follow a series of these lit way-points through the woods. Each time I get close, the lamp attached to the tree I'm approaching flashes and makes that industrial lighting starter clanging sound. I jumped at the first one, anticipated the second then, surprisingly to me, I jumped again at the third. This was *not* going well for me.After visiting a number of those pools of light, the next lit area is an entryway into something like a cross between a tiled cellar and a military bunker. Doors creak and slam (often slamming by themselves) and there's the odd bit of story content stuck to the walls here and there. I was getting very nervous indeed by this point.Down toward the end of a shadowy corridor, I glimpsed something the story content had foreshadowed, which I shan't give away, but this somewhat deepened the anxiety. A corner or two further into the installation, the batteries go dead in the torch. The screen is totally black. Anticipating that there was going to be something coming at me out of that blackness, I alt-tabbed out, took off the headset, and closed the game.It had been 9 minutes.Damn.Full marks from me. It did what it set out to do. I just couldn't take it."

If you are normal, you will stay calm but really feel uncomfortable...No fight, no violence, no gore.Play it alone, in the dark after midnight.I just tried it 30 min, I will come back soon. Good dose of stress."

,Recommended,542520,27987692,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,zimteh,"No cheap jump scares but very well made terror, gnawing away at your mind. Constantly intensifying and never letting you relax. The atmosphere and style is quite absorbing. So that you can't tell for how long you've been in there. The playstyle builts quite a bit of suspense and kept me on the edge of my seat, as far as that is possible whilst standing.Only thing that bothered me were the very few introductory elements in the beginning, which on the other hand helped to actively play the game and not just letting the game guide you through.The game is not strong in terms of story, but it definitely does what it's supposed to do: It scares the crap out of you."

,Recommended,542520,26746487,"Posted: 22 November, 2016",all,SweViver,"WOW, Lost In The Rift - Reborn is probably the most scary VR horror experience so far! Check out my first 25 minutes of gameplay in VR and MIXED REALITY view as well, you have to see this and try it!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj9F1aMAreM""Lost In The Rift - Reborn"" was released on Steam today and this is a full HTC Vive roomscale experience with motion control tracking, free Vive trackpad movement and very good graphics and sound effects. The VR immersion and presence inside of Lost In The Rift is truly amazing, as you walk freely around in dark woods, pitch black corridors, basements and varied terrifying sceneries trying to survive.You are experiencing an environment full of strange things happening, while you explore the terrible fate of a young girl missing, called Anna Surley. My Last In The Rift - Reborn HTC Vive gameplay video covers the first 20-30 minutes of the storyline (without spoiling the story actually) and I hope you will get a taste of what this VR Horror Experience is about!So whay do I think about this game? Well I love it already only playing it about an hour into the story. It gives me chills, goosbumps and Im scared almost instantly so I can promise you real VR horror in this title, with both jump scares but also a very scary and uncomfortably dark surroundings - you are afraid and terrified for every step you take!Graphics is great, the sound effects are just perfect, the storyline seems intresting and the gameplay is exactly what I was expecting. And dont forget: Its a free movement game, so you can actually walk freely around without teleporting - what a surprise!Great work made by the developers, big thanks for letting us play this refreshing VR horror game!I will update this review later on when I have completed the game, or when more content gets added. But for now, Im recommending it to all of you guys that have a HTC Vive. Both thumbs up!"
,Recommended,542520,31528411,Posted: 3 May,all,Sierra71,"It's been very hard for me to decide if this game is worth recommending.You know that moment in a horror movie when you're watching the main character go into some dark, scary room where you just KNOW the monster/killer is hiding? You know how you want to scream at them, ""don't go in there, you moron!"" This game will make you feel like that, but you are the moron going into that stupidly scary dark place.This game is undoubtedly a scary experience, and my first one of such in VR. I will not praise it on its game design in general, but in the context of VR, it does what it sets out to do.Playing it in VR is scary, and quite unnerving, however, this is not because the game itself is particularly scary or well-made. Rather, VR does the scaring. If you ripped the game out of VR, the best you would get is one or two cheap jump scares and a rather boring maze crawl.That being said, playing this will put you on edge. It will scare you. You will quit like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ the first time you have to walk through a door. The jumpscares I mentioned do exist, but the way the developer crafted this game, within the context of VR, makes them the least fightening part. There is an absolutely frightening atmosphere of sounds and experiences throughout that will cause you to have the feeling of ""why am I here; I should not be here"". The sense of being in this place is what is truly scary.I recommend this with the following notes. Having played it, I would not pay more than $5.00 for it. For the price, it works and is scary. Get this game if you want to experience the new baseline in horror games. This not-that-well-made game, is scarier than every single horror game I've ever played on a monitor. Get this game if you want to scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your friends."

(if the creators of this game are reading this I would love another! top notch!)  worth the price even if it's just to send your parents and friends threw it and watch their reactions. truly priceless!

I wore headphones and turned the sound up but still, nothing really here. A few mundane sounds are not enough to make me jump. Walking and walking and walking and walking and nothing.I spent 30 mins walking around and eventually got lost in a supply closet. Forced myself to backtrack and then gave up. Uneventful. If this scares you, you need to get out more."

I didn't finish the game..  while playing I was trying to find excuses to quit it, like ""I'm too tired now, I'll continue tomorrow""..The honest truth is that this game was scaring the hell out of me.  Could it be that for just 4.99 EUR, I bought the scariest VR game currently available? Don't miss this."

Takes just about 30mins to finish.  Not as scary as Amnesia and nowhere near as good a story as Chair in a Room: Greenwater.  Does what it sets out to you so if ya up for a quick scare - go for it :)"
