It's nice that it has a difficulty setting as some of these rogue-lite's can be painfully hard (I'm looking at you Enter the Gungeon).  Runs great on Linux,  Highly recommended."
76561198061974601,Recommended,542660,31248669,Posted: 19 April,all,[LINUX] facePlanted,"I've just beat the game on Normal difficulty but upvoting because I already know it deserves it.The gameplay and the engine are solid, the levels are procedurally generated (which I love), the progression is fair, the music is cool and the game in general is fun.There are lots of weapons, items and secrets which I still didn't discover, and a 'daily run' which saves your score online.The price is cheap compared with the content, it could cost double and still be ok.I see ppl comparing it to ""Binding of Isaac"", I have that game and played it less than one hour, it just didn't grab me,this title instead have my attention, probably because of the different art setting, I'll put more hours into it.The Devs are nice and supportive and it works perfectly on Linux, thank you Devs for this great game!"

Multiple passive to unlock tough you may unlock them fast. New characters upon completing a higher difficulty. And with it's low price there is no reason not to get it."
76561197994873576,Recommended,542660,31278114,Posted: 21 April,all,*Xenolord,"My story of Feral Fury began with my roommate who came to me one day and said 'So I found a thing you might enjoy'. Famous first words. So, he winds up showing me this neat little twin-stick shooter with a panda in power armor. My first thought was 'that's adorable'. My second thought shortly after was a resounding: 'THIS IS AWESOME!' He tells me that I'm free to play it when he's at work, as we Steam Share. He has .7 hours on it at the time of my writing this. I have almost twenty.If you like games like The Binding of Issac, Nuclear Throne, Enter the Gungeon and others, Feral Fury is a MUST BUY for you. I'll go ahead and echo what everyone else seems to say, but it's true. The controls are tight and responsive, allowing for the fine movements you'll need. The combat is both visceral and fast-paced, making split decisions the difference between life and death. The system is as forgiving as it is unforgiving, punishing second-thoughts and the slow-witted, but rewarding those who understand how the game functions. The soundtrack is perhaps a bit too cheery for what the game is, but it just underlines the deceptive nature of the game.With permanent upgrades to be unlocked after every run, you'll begin to see improvement with each death, and each time you meet a new enemy, you'll learn how they fight and how they die (enemies mostly give a final attack as they die). Each step, each misstep is a learning experience you'll grow from.Start on easy. I don't often say that, but Easy builds the base mechanics of the game, and allows you to build the more advanced mechanics later on. If you start too hard, you'll just overwhelm yourself. The bosses are fun and amusing, as well as being challenging and rewarding.Just keep one thing in mind when playing though... you can only gain so much experience from playing this game. It takes something else to really complete it. Reactions, bravery, training... all of that can be taught. It takes something else, something different to get far. A primordial fire, a feral fury is needed to truly master this game."
,Not Recommended,542660,32781182,Posted: 25 June,all,Sankozi,pros:- nice aestheticscons:- grinding (you can buy upgrades outside of the game)- engine slows down when there is more action on level- big zoom makes it hard to know where to shoot on bigger levels - just look at- boring upgrades- boring levels- you can carry only one weapon + starting pistol
76561198005315023,Recommended,542660,31060418,Posted: 10 April,all,LASER LORD,"Feral Fury is a super solid Roguelite.Controls are nice, visuals are cool, enemy design is good.Something very cool about it is that it basically explains nothing but the basic controls and leaves you to figure everything else out on your own. There's nothing to complicated to figure out, but when you do, it certainly makes you feel clever.Gameplay is really well put together and the difficulty balance seems fair.Devs also seem to be really active in comms and taking on feedback.Only real crit is the total absence of story, but it's no biggie. Mainly here to shoot pig demons in the face.If you're looking for a roguelike you can bosh through in 8-10hrs, and you like the idea of playing a Kickass SpacePanda, this is probably for you."
,Recommended,542660,30939892,Posted: 4 April,all,clippa,"Good top down shooter roguelite with permanent character progression.Quite easy on normal mode, but hard mode definitely cranks things up.There are unlockable characters, there's one that has crappy health like the poop from isaac if you want an extra challenge.Well worth the 4 quid. Started out as a phone game but you'd never know.60fps, good m/kb controls."
76561198338743405,Recommended,542660,31850417,Posted: 19 May,all,FadedSeven,"Very fun game,it reminded me a lot of ""The Binding of Isaac"" with the secret rooms and the itmes.I'm still wondering about the Talisman portal thou, I have three ones but I don't seem to find the forth one to open it's portal!Oh well I'll figure it out eventually."

76561198195502290,Recommended,542660,33873317,Posted: 28 July,all,wtfcnote,"Feral Fury is a great twitch reation strategic shooter. Although A.I. is simple it is supprisingly difficult to contend with in this roguelike. Very smooth simple controls and mechanics. looks to have some replay value with daily runs, randomized levels setups, and loads of powerups and weapons. Wish my gameplay was faster however would be awesome to see it run without lag at times.Special thanks to the developers for troubleshooting my previous buffer problems. They were quick to respond after my first negetive review and kept in contact until problems were resolved. I was also told that they are planning on optimizing the game further for laptops and other lower end rigs.Haven't beat the game or even my first boss yet, but stil feel comfortable recommending this game as well give it a solid 8/10."

If you enjoy Binding of Issac, and are looking for another game similar to it, then I would recommend this one. I sat and played it for 2 hours straight, then came to write this review. There are lots of cool weapons and items to unlock, and many other hidden secrets to find as well. I 100% recommend this one, and its quite inexpensive."

76561198122574382,Recommended,542660,31290750,Posted: 22 April,all,wesley.thomas,"The result of Soggy Biscuits between Warhammer 40,000 and Kung Fu Panda, with Smash TV playing the part of the cookie. A top-down shooter rogue-like mixing science fiction and fantasy, and a dose of gore-soaked arcade-style action. However, frequent crashes and no way to quit in the middle bring it down from perfect. Still gets a big thumbs up.EDIT: ""Restart"" takes the place of ""quit."""
,Recommended,542660,30949047,Posted: 4 April,all,Kronberg,"This game is a great rogue like game that looks good and runs smoothly.Theres lot of secrets to uncover, explosions, weapons and in generel lot of funny stuff to explore.I played it on normal and i died really fast, maybe its my skills - who knows :)I made a gameplay review, please check it out:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2VQMkFr1HE&feature=youtu.be"
,Not Recommended,542660,32228847,Posted: 6 June,all,NoobixCube,"It's far too slow paced, for my liking, and the graphics are kind of lifeless.  It all looks like a late 2000s Newgrounds flash game."
,Recommended,542660,31796302,Posted: 16 May,all,Jaycob,A really fun rogue-like that deserves more recognition.

76561198008580123,Not Recommended,542660,34559091,Posted: 28 August,all,PRAVEMI,"First... this is not actually a bad game.Second.. this is too standard 2D rogue maze shooter game....where space pandas fighting evil pigs (that's original I must say... brutal pandas!)PROS? Game is everytime creating a different maze full of items, enemies, traps, bosses, etc.CONS? Everytime the differences are ver very very too... same. Still just a few types of enemies, same traps, same rooms patterns, weapons with too similar effects...So... as I said... this is not a bad game... but there are better ones (for example Isaac serie)."
76561198031486205,Not Recommended,542660,30912629,Posted: 2 April,all,Mofongo Overlord,In the short amount of time i've played this game all i've had is nothing but crashes and performance issues especially around explosions. Stay away until this is fixed.Edit: Still getting performance issues and it seems that when i have long sessions the game gets super laggy. While the game is fun I still can't recommend it because of these issues. There are also some crashes when trying to trade items with the red panda. Until these issues are fixed i can't recommend.
