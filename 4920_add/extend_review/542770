Personally, I think Castle Must Be Mine really is worth the price tag of about 7 dollars, as it seems to be many different levels available, the game difficulty level progresses the more you play and gets quite high after a while, as you can see in my video, so I assume you can spend a lot of time playing Castle Must Be Mine on your HTC Vive in VR.I will continue to play this game and will extend this review further on, but for now Im REALLY recommending this game, its so cute and funny! :)"

I can't wait for more content, not that it lacks a proper amount, it's just that I freaking LOVE this game and want it to keep growing and growing.

Definitely worth the price-tag today.The boulder-throwing, switching into first-person mode, is a nice touch.

The game features 12 total maps in three different areas (forest/grass, desert and ice), a large variety of enemies and a surprising amount of strategy.  In addition to building and upgrading towers, there is also a Knight that can be positioned around the map to attack/slow down enemies, unique area-specific spells, and last-ditch castle defenses that have to be manned in a first-person mode.  The game can get quite hectic at times, but that's all part of the fun.  Highly recommended."

I have been waiting for a castle defense title for the Vive and this one is a joy to play. It is pretty simple, not a whole lot of variety in powers, towers or baddies, but what is there is very enjoyable. There is plenty of gameplay for the price, I just played for about 1.5 hours and am only a handful of levels into the game. I absolutely love when a developer is clever. The rock from the castle wall power is pretty darn cool (better if it were a cross bow) and I got a kick out of the animations on the fire meteor tower, especially the loading circle at the top. I feel like I am a violent Lego land, and who does not love that. I will happily buy more from this developer. Way to go!"

The game is well balanced and i think it would be a pretty good challange to get full 3 star on each map. I like the ability to move my hero dude around and drop fireballs and boulders on enemys heads. Only downside to this game is the fairly low amount of content available. would like to see more diverse towers, right now there are only 3 tower types, balista, magic, and cannon and can be upgraded 2 times on the last level and none of them infilct any status ailments like slow or freeze or anything. but with that said its still in EA and the price tag is not bad at all.

Adding VR to a tower defense game just works so well, and while the major difference between this and a top-down TD game is ""reach and click"" versus ""point and click"", it's just so much more engaging.  There's a good variety of enemies, though I wish for better specialization of towers.  The upgrade paths are linear and a bit boring in that respect.  I find myself coming back to this game every time I put on the Vive."

I got the HTC Vive a while back and have been mostly disappointed at the dearth of games out there for the platform that aren't horror (I'm a big ol' scaredypants!).  This game, however, is easy to pick up and play, but incredibly challenging in the best ways.  The graphics are exactly as good as they need to be, and the gameplay is exceedingly satisfying.It says a lot for a game of this few levels that I've come back over and over again to play the same maps to get my 3 stars.

Also, if you don't like tower defense and are looking for something different to play in VR... get it!  Either way, you're going to have a good time.  Totally worth it.

You can build different towers and upgrade them to combat a variety of monsters. Alongside this you have a hero character which you can move around depending on where he is needed.The game also allows you to participate in the defence from a combat perspective instead of solely building towers. The game gives you abilities like throwing a fireball onto the table to cause AOE damage to the monsters, you also unlock other abilities as you progress through the game like being able to throw boulders from the top of the gate.The game is a truly immersive tower defence VR that is fairly challenging, having to repeat several levels to complete them."
,Recommended,542770,35141450,Posted: 22 September,all,Cymatic,"Not just an incredible tower defense game, an incredible VR game.Heat-of-the-moment tower defense works when there are just enough (or maybe slightly too many) tasks to keep track of, and this title strikes that balance well - with VR in mind. The use of clear audio cues, the act of collecting money, tower layouts/spacing, the micromanagement of the hero, the varied manual defense options on the top of the castle; all of these things make you forget about VR and simply concentrate on managing the virtual table. Suberb!The only issue I could possibly bring up with this game is the user experience on Oculus. I have both Rift and Vive, and room scale Vive is by far the superior experience. A seated or standing Rift experience requires quite a bit of turning and positioning. The teleport mechanic is clunky in the heat of battle, and the buttons used to turn are the same buttons that sell towers - I have accidentally sold a tower more than once. I know that Rift support is new, I expect it will get better with time.If I were to make a list right now of the best VR games all time, this one is top 5 for sure."

With this title however, I'm able to teleport to an area on the map that works for my environment, and really just let myself be immersed into the game. While not overly difficult, a bit of planning and strategy is required. Overall, I think this is going to be my new daily game. I just hope for lots of more content/play time in the future since it's an early access title. If you're into tower defense games, give this one a shot!"
76561197979705736,Recommended,542770,29220441,Posted: 13 January,all,Biub,"I enjoyed it, definitely worth the price of admission.  While still early access, the base mechanics are sound, while leaving room for new features in the future.  In addition to placing towers, a major gameplay mechanic is moving the knight character around. He will engage one creature at a time, locking it in place to allow your towers to shoot at it for longer.You also get a fireball/meteor spell attack that recharges, and later levels give you a limited supply of boulders to chuck down at enemies closing in on your castle.  I found the boulders to be fairly underwhelming considering the limited supply you get, but they do push enemies back if you just need a few extra seconds for your towers to whittle them down, so they can be useful. The fireball/meteor is fun, although its damage seems pretty paltry. I am also a rather terrible shot with it, so I wouldn't mind some sort of aiming reticle or texture on the ground to show where the attack will hit, but I could also just ""get gud"" and aim better.There are multiple enemy types, especially by the last currently available level.  You've got fast guys, slow guys, guys who take less damage from magic, all sorts of things.  Good variety.  Oh, and a boss-type that will seriously mess your knight up if you don't micro him around.Anyway, if you've got a VR headset, and you like tower defense games, pick this up. Cheaper than going to the movies, and with the promise of more content on the way, it will give you hours of fun."

,Recommended,542770,27079083,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,dogtato,"I bought this because I got frustrated watching ownedbytamater play it. I think the controls are fairly obvious, though the icon for the magic tower looks like a bow and arrow to me. The main mechanic that sets this apart as a tower defense game is the soldier you control that can be used to engage the enemies and either clump them up or string them out, depending on your choice of cannons vs magic (magic seems to be strongest atm). Everytime you pick him up and drop him next to an enemy, he takes a swing at the enemy and the enemy stops and attacks back. If you leave him be, he'll continue to fight that one enemy with an attack every few seconds. If you pick him back up and drop him right away, he'll take another swing without waiting. Maybe it's exploity, but it feels intentional because you get to micromanage this one guy while the towers run on autopilot. Also he gets XP every time he hits, so spamming the hits really helps later on.Also there are fireballs you can pick up and throw at the enemies. It takes a while to recharge, but you hear when it does so it doesn't sit there going to waste.If you like tower defense games, this is a worthwhile VR adaptation of the genre. My one gripe is it's too easy to accidentally build an archery tower when you're trying to pick your guy up."

I keep the review short, since i just want to say that i really enjoyed the game so far.This game is VERY POLISHED for an EA title! Great work guys! The content amount is perfectly fine for this low price.-The difficulty ramps up a bit too quickly later.-I do not like the boulder throw mechanic. I would prefer some other magic effect that does not pull you out of the action.-The music needs more variation.Keep up the great work and i'am looking forward to further improvements."

76561198025188122,Recommended,542770,29709681,Posted: 4 February,all,Not Ian,"A very fun tower defense game for VR. Classic towers, a minion you can move around to temporarily stop monsters in their tracks, a good set of enemies. It's good as it is, and has huge potential.There are some small bugs (misbehaviors, from my perspective) that make it a little difficult to get three stars on a map. These are all things I think have contributed to me frustratingly losing lives.I've found when dropping the fireball, sometimes it bounces in an unexpected way off the table. I try to ""place"" it on the table instead of throwing it, but it's hard when I'm rushing to kill enemies.Another thing is I think the magic towers shot doesn't always make it to the monster. Sometimes (1 of 25) it seems like the magic ball hits something on its way to the enemy (sometimes the tower itself if the enemy is close to the base). This can be a big deal for a wave, and might mean an enemy goes through.One last small thing, is I wish I could move the minion closer to the castle where enemies are moving to. Sometimes I'll quickly try to grab and place him by the castle (I'm fairly sure I pick him up correctly, as I feel the vibration in my controller) but when I let go, he doesn't teleport there. This sucks when I have an enemy close to the castle and need to kill it just before it goes in.Despite all that, it's a very fun game."

You might want to add how much damage each tower does when you are going it buy it, also maybe how much speed it has too. Also maybe a different colored circle indicating what the upgraded range of the tower will increase to, like a green circle maybe. so you would have two circles, the current towers range, and the upgradable range. This would also work if you incorporate more upgrades if you choose. I'm only a few levels in, but I'm glad that this exists."

It's similar to games like Kingdom Rush where the build locations are static and you can select one of 3 types of tower to build, with different properties.You might be thinking, ""it doesn't seem like there's any reason to have tower defense in VR,"" but you can really get into the action of the game. Part of what helps is that you're not just staring at the board the whole time, you can use powers like literally throwing fireballs, moving a warrior anywhere on the board, and even taking control of some of the castle's own defenses to help.This game also has a ton of gameplay for the price, especially if you're trying to 3 star every level. There are about 15 levels, broken up into 3 zones each with their own enemies and defensive powers. If you're a fan of tower defense games, this game guarentees a bang for your buck."
