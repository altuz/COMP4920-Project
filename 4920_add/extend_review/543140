Got annoyed checking the prices at each seller and the buyer each day. Alternative game modes were nice.Would have liked it more if pricing information was saved as you learned it. If I were really a merchant I would learn all the average prices on the items I was dealing.Enjoyed for a couple play throughs, but can't say I would recommend to a friend."

The dev clearly states that this is just a ""mini-game"" and they are correct. Unfortunately.If the game even had one or two ""data screens"" that let you view your inventory at a glance or show internal tracking of prices, I'd probably still be playing it. A nice job, but incomplete."

,Not Recommended,543140,28652980,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Cassandra,"Well how to begin with. This game begins with a cute drawing of the developer talking to you, and giving you some money to begin with. In 50 days, he wants you to pay it back with a %100 rate. Reasonable. Still a bad banker. After that he just pushes you to game. Without saying a single thing and a single tutorial, I'm freaking confused. There are people that you can click, when you click, there're more people, and when you click a sleeping dude, It says finish the day. It's not hard to figure out the whole process, but It was still a ""What now?"" for a brief moment for me. I couldn't manage to get the wanted money in 50 days, so I was kicked out, which is fine, I know I suck at trading. But well; pros and consPROS:- Art is cute, still a little bit confusing but it was cute- AT THE BEGINNING the music was nice, it kinda got repetitive afterwards- Suprise aspect. I wasn't really expecting to find money on the roas while I was on my way! These little randoms made me happy or sad, nonetheless, it made the game a little less boringCONS:- Sounds. Not the music but the clicking sound annoyed me after some time. Some ambient or different clicking would make it a little less mediocre- Interface is kinda tires you out after some time. I got bored clicking E or back or other people, noting, there are no animations, it just shows the other screen, yeah, it got annoying at some point.- Gameplay, its repetitive. I couldn't get to see past 50 days, got bored.- No storyline.OVERALLIt's boring right now, at least for me, but it has some potential. Maybe adding a storyline can add a little bit of a spice to game, changing some interface a bit may help you get through it. And maybe, adding seasons to the game would make it more interesting. Liked the suprise fact, and cute art, but it wasn't for me."

Gameplay loop is simple but well done and it's quite polished for a early access game. My biggest complaints are that translation isn't the best but is serviceable and the game could do with some more music tracks since the only one that there is can become annoying. But overall it looks like the final version is going to be a pretty good game.

Repetitive yet has replay valueIndeed this game has no story, or well- you could make up a story in your head.I love the market concept, the trading, buying selling goods stuffThe achievements is interesting to collectThough the music can be bit annoyying for a while, but then you can mute it and put on a music from your pc on your own.Cute art, loving itStill trying to get 300k in new legend"

That is not including the economy events or the 20% increase/decrease depending on vendors but the randomization of item prices. Still I give it a thumbs up none the less."
