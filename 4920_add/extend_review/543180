More of a tech demo with a lot of wasted potential."

Honestly, i feel like $5 might even be a bit cheap for what you get here.  While you may want to compare this to other tank games like warthunder or world of tanks, this is a lot more ""acrade-y.""PROS-Awesome gameplay-Graphics are great-Soundtrack and audio in general are fantastic-Fully customizable tanks.  Earn unlocks by playing-Multiplayer is fun-There is a solo campaign-Had lots of fun playingCONS-Had an issue with the game crashing when trying to play the second campaign level.  Happened 3 times in a row.-I bought the game when it first came out, so there was only ~20 people playing online.  Somehow a bunch of them were already level 60, while I was level 1.  How does that happen within an hour of release?  I couldnt even penetrate their armor.  I imagine that the ranking system will work itself out as more people play however.  I may have been playing against developers testing the servers once they went live."

,Recommended,543180,30768217,Posted: 27 March,all,Generic Waffle,"Despite it being a mobile port, this is a suprisingly solid game. The tank customisation is incredible, and game mechanics are a satisfactory blend between WoT and War Thunder. The spotting mechanic is remarkable, as tanks are full visable but name tags show when you actually look and spot them, unlike War Tunder where you can spot tanks in a huge radius so stealth isnt an option, and unlike WoT where tanks are invisible until you spot them.You can ignore the reviews about long load times, as they are one off. After it loads 1 type of each part, loading parts are about 4 seconds.Just be sure to reset the games resolution to your monitor's natural resolution to enable full mouse control.Overall, 7.5/10"
76561198142609288,Recommended,543180,30750897,Posted: 26 March,all,jwrigly,"####YAY THEY'VE FIXED THE SERVERS (mostly)#####So I originally bought this because back in the day I played Seek and Destroy for the PS2 which looks quite similar to this; £3.99 was also a small price to pay compared to other games. I can see that this was ported from iOS and I wouldn't say it's a paticularly bad port from what I've played so far .The main problem with the game is that their 'servers' seems to be one overheating box with a pentium 4 in it. I was met with a long loading icon, waiting for my reward for completing a campaign mission; sometimes I got it and others it just timed out.When the game first launched the servers were awful and my requests were always timing out. I am pleased to say that the servers (for the most part) are very good. Multiplayer games run very smoothly for me (unless someone has an awful ping) . The requests to get rewards after completing missions still take a decent amount of time but it's no longer game-breaking.One thing I wish was a little bit smoother was tank customization. The customization is basically the core selling point of this game and it's probably the most tedious thing to do ; it's because every time you make a change to your tank it has to communicate with the server to deduct funds and manage your inventory of parts. It can probably take up to 5 seconds to remove each part which can be really annoying when you're moving parts around multiple tanks. I would say that they may be able to fix this by having a system that lets you make a bunch of changes and then you can confirm them all with a push of a button so the time spent communicating with the server is reduced.I really hope the server issues are fixed within the next couple of daysbecause it's a good, quirky little game. There seems to be a large amount of customization that can be applied to your tanks - as well as there being 4 classes of tanks Scout, Light , Medium and Heavy. You can customize pretty much everything on the tank - the body, tracks, engine , turret etc and you can apply various boosts to your tank (Not microtransaction stat boosts, just modules that you earn after completing missions).I've played through the whole campaign and it was 'meh'.  The story is pretty cringe and is comparable to something that I would come up with when I used to play with my toy soldiers. About as cliche as you can be with a rogue AI and nukes - but that's ok. I doubt it's really the selling point of this game. The destruction is decent ; your shots will take a couple of good chunks out of buildings and will blow up small props like cars and helicopters in game. I do not believe that there is destruction to the extent of buildings falling down like red faction. The campaign is pretty much a necessary evil to work through because it gives you lots of XP so you can level up and gain new parts for your tank.The graphics are fine ; when I was comparing this to a PS2 game this was not what I meant. They're nothing groundbreaking but they get the job done. Though the average graphics connoisseur would probably not be impressed.One thing that I didn't really like about the gameplay is that generally you'll do a lot better with a heavy tank or a tank destroyer rather than a scout or light tank. It's mainly because a light tank only takes around 1 or 2 well-placed shells to bring them down most of the time (when using a heavy or medium tank).I think another reason as well is that the position of your tank doesn't matter too much in this game as long as the shell penetrates ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). If you're in a light tank you'll probably lose to a 1v1 with a heavy/medium tank if you're both on full health. Even if you angle your tank against an incoming shell, it doesn't negate all that much damage. Equally, when you land a good hit on a tank (a 90 degree shot on the side or back) the damage does not change that much.I did five shots in the test range on the heavy tank. I shot the tank 90 degrees in the front, 90 degrees on the side and 90 degrees on the back. For the front I got either 370 or 369 damage for my results. The side I got 407 or 406 damage from my results from the back I got 462 or 463 damage for my results.So assuming that the 90 degree shot on the front of 370 damage is my 'base damage' the shot on the side yielded a 10% damage increase. My shot on the back of the tank of 462 damage yielded a damage increase of around 25% (rounding up). Whilst these damage increases do make aiming for these areas worthwhile (especially for heavy tanks with large damage outputs) it does not make the light tank viable in anyway. The gun on the light tank does not output enough damage compared to other tanks to make it worthwhile from a number's perspective ; which is a shame because I really like running light/medium tanks to try and flank. (I am not saying this just to cover up that I'm crap at the game. : D )In terms of performance I imagine this could run on a toaster, at low settings at 720p. I'm current running this on Ultra 2560x1440 and I'm getting 100+ frames most of the time (R9 390, i7-4790K No OC).Bottom line is I think it's a good game with deep customization and maybe a lot of replay value in the multiplayer. If you're thinking of buying this I'd would recommend it for £3.99 . I don't think this a game that I'll be hardcoring and playing a lot but I'll come back to it every once in a while. (Like those clan members that sit up on the hills in the arctic map in top tier tank destroyers and completely own you. Damn. I couldn't do anything against them. D:)Apologies if any information is incorrect / not present because I have only played this for a little while."
76561197974642082,Recommended,543180,30762150,Posted: 26 March,all,AdeptMechanicus,Update:Server issues seem to have been fixed plus more graphics options added in todays patch. Impressed by the fast patching from devs.Original review:If you arew looking fun and massively customizable tank arcade game this is for you. It has been ported from IOS and from what I can see optimized PC but it needs more work.Optimization could do with some tweeking for more graphics options and settings.Single player and drills work well however wait times for server connection require fixing and can cause you to waste money purchasing the same equipment multiple times.  This is not as bad as it could be as there are NO micro tansactions anywhere with all currency being earned in game.  This is a very nice change for a $5 mobile port.For those having problems with the user interface make sure your in game resolution is set to your monitors native resolution and your mouse will now work for navigation.P.S. Expect to come up against high ranking IOS players.

76561198029757850,Recommended,543180,30766967,Posted: 26 March,all,Tommycore,"tl;dr: Worth the 5 bucks.After playing 2 hours, I must say that this was money well spent. I didn't experience any connection problems like many others have reported. Even with my crappy internet connection, it is a matter of seconds to exchange parts, so it seems like that issue has been fixed. Also, someone said that this game wouldn't have an options menu, which is simply not true. You can adjust resolution and graphics settings.The game has some minor issues though. The GUI is a bit suboptimal. For example the red flashing button after you changed a component first made me think that I couldn't fit that part into the tank, while it was only meant to indicate which button is selected. Also, the menu navigation is a bit unclear. But tbh, this is complaining on a higher level.While the environment is nearly completely destructible, many buildings leave a frame, meaning you can't drive through them. A pity, that would have been a really fun feature, just waltzing through some factory, living quarter or what have you.Contentwise, the game offers 14 missions. I'm already at mission 8. But the 360 drills make up for that. You can also have custom sp missions, and then there's still the multiplayer.This game is definitely not ""pushing the  boundaries with modern graphics and exceptionally deep gameplay"". For example the outline effect that indicates how well you hit, is rather cheap. But what Infinite Tanks does offer is solid craftmanship. The graphics do look nice, and the game is fun to play.Also, the ""Incredible realism"" thing is a bit euphemistic. It's an arcady shooter game, not a simulation. Which is exactly what makes this game fun to play. It's rather easy to get into, but becoming good takes time and practice.So, all in all, 5€ is effing cheap. I mean - seriously - the worst part of the game is the developers description on this store page ;) If you're even remotely interested in this game, go ahead and give it a try."

76561198001709736,Recommended,543180,30806621,Posted: 28 March,all,-=EDF=- Kouta Seto,"Ok , time for a review and to make things clear:First: The high latency is duo to this game being a NA game only. We can be happy that we have access right now, yet it is MENT to be played only in North America.Second: The startup crash: If people, and yes i am angry so i use language as well, are as stupid as to think EVERYTHING needs to work whenever they want, and then dont even accept the lousy solution that is : Switch to a lower desctop resolution, not ingame but outgame with your actual desctop, then i can only feel sorry for the not existend brains of them.Third: Ragequitters and stuff. Shure one like that gets switched by AI, yet without the AI performing like in the actual PVE campaign, their more of a burden for the team than a help. I would rather fight 6 dudes alone than to have 5 AI's that die faster than i do.Now for the pro's and cons atm. Its subject to change as soon as more servers are available (they claim we will get an EU one too, so i hope they hold up to this promise);Pro's:- Huge customisationm posibility, ya can change parts of your tank like tracks/wheels, the turret, the gun, even modifie some parts with either intern chips (CPU's even thou thats as wrong as the german translation of the name on the steam page especiel for certain anime fans out there) plus you can paint your tank- Ballanced PVP battles, ya get boosted if you get into a high level room, yet not as much as to rival the equipment of them, still you are very much capable of dealing blow's to even them. Sadly this is a con too, yet more on that later- Easy to learn gameplay, not so hard to master actualy, all you need to know is when to hide- Nice weapons and sub weapons to chose from. From guns over HMG's to missles with little guidance function (no real auto target fire and forget missles). Even a mortar for firing on a certain range over obstacles(wich even gets blocked if your under a bridge) and mines to♥♥♥♥♥♥off people who accidentaly drive on them.Cons:-High lag posibility in PVP because server situated in the US- Longer waiting time depending on your conection speed (i run at 26k and have to say i rarely wait for more than 3 seconds for changes to my tank or something else, my ping is at 140, wich is not as bad as , for example, in S4 back in the day's (where it sometimes and most of the times was 200+)- Low Playerbase (Mainly because of those who dont know how to properly try and error to fix problems and obstacles like the crash at the beginning (wich is still easily solved by using a LOWER RESOLUTION TO LAUNCH IT THE FIRST TIME!)- The Armor system is useless. Shure ya can block SOME incoming fire with angeling , there is even a tutorial on this, yet even with the best armor equipment and boosts one cant repell GREY equiped guns. Armor should be , not like in WOT, a real thing, making you slow and unmanouverable, yet near inpenetrable too. I still hope that Blitz 1942 returns, so people learn the value of heavy armored assault tanks again, their ment to take tremendos fire from the front, yet are useless against fast tanks that drive to their flanks and back.- No ADS against missles even thou in reality there are such things already, with some army's and defence forces, like the Bundeswehr ( i live in germany so i have the most data on them from all of the worlds army's/Defence forces), developing new ones as we speak (not to mention the new 130 mm smoothbore gun, yet i doubt that rheinmetall will go as far as to deploy this gun, the 120L55 is enogh for any tank of the world). And yes, no near ultimate defence ,wich needs quiet some time for reload , against missles is a con especiel in scifi games.Thats it. I will continue to enjoy this game (as long as tokyo warefare is not updated with the newest patch wich is soon to hit hopefully, they cant stay in japan forever on their ""vacation""(actualy they seem to try to get certain rights and data regarding WW2 vehicles AND hopefully a certain Kaiju we might fight in the future there as event and fun)I can only reccomend this game to anyone who played WOT, and wants full customize options over their tank. If ya just want tank battles with a mediocre system, then i suggest play WOT instead. Its free, yet not as fun as Infinite Tanks(mainly because there are fun gamemodes, there are custom made tanks, there are  NO OP TANKS THAT NEVER EXISTED IN WW2!)"
