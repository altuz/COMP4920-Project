Performance on my computer is flawless and the physics are very realistic.  I was almost worn out after 35 minutes of play... This is a very fun and challenging game.  Love the environments, the sound, and the robot characters.  No complaints."
76561197968761535,Not Recommended,543390,33843412,Posted: 27 July,all,AnD4D,"While I do enjoy this game (and think it's gorgeous), at the moment I simply can't recommend it.For starters, while I love wave shooters like these, I don't play VR games to challenge myself. I play them to have fun. Let me compare it to Raw Data for the time being.In Raw Data, you have different difficulty levels to play it at. You have live/health which will regenerate if you avoid damage for a certain period of time.In this game, on easiest difficulty level, if you ever take 4 hits, you need to start the section over. On top of that, the robots are perfect shots, every time. Always aiming for the middle of the forehead, no matter how easy you request the game. If you EVER see a robot fire, you NEED to dodge.Now, take the session I just played as an example. I'm fending off enemies left right and centre, dodging bullets all over the place. Suddenly my screen flashes red, indicating that I'd been hit. Puzzled, I turn around to find one robot has spawned in directly behind me without warning. Sure, they make a noise when they spawn in, but if you happen to be firing at the same time, you will most likely miss it. Once spawned in, they make no noise whatsoever. It's like you're being attacked by robo-ninjas with soft padded feet.While I'm turned around fighting that one, a robot with a machine gun spawns in behind me again, on a lower level and starts hitting me. My level greys out, and I have to start all over again.After going through the same thing again and again and again, I finally get further along, then meet the same fate because a new pattern of spawns has appeared. Finishing a level the first time through, I'd wager, it next to impossible. You need to learn the patterns, and be a damn good shot. If you don't get a headshot with your first hit, the robot recoils, making additional shots even harder.THEN, just as you get close to the end, the game freezes and crashes you out. So... 15 minutes of trying to do the same level over and over, and in the end I lose my progress because the game crashes.On top of that, when we approach the developers and ask for them to make easy mode actually easy, they laugh and tell us to ""get good""! Then reluctantly say they'll add a few lives to the player. Why have lives at all? Go for what Raw Data did, and give us health! If we get hit a few times, but manage to avoid hits for a long time, let us recover some health!One time I got hit very early on, but then got to the end of a section and got punched from behind and lost my progress needing to start over.There's a point where the game transitions over from fun to boring. If people want to play the game on easy mode, let them. Don't make us feel bad or like we're wasting our time.Until that's added in, this game get a ""Not Recommended"" from me."
,Recommended,543390,31989462,Posted: 26 May,all,T.Pyrdol,"This game has alot of potential. It's seriously fun, and I will change this to recommended when it's not reprojecting all the time. The level of optimization is extremely amature level. Before you call my PC a potato, I am on a 1080 ti, 7700k, 16gb of ram, and have been PC gaming for Decades . I am reprojecting on the lowest setting with no Super Sampling. I'm not even mentioning the game elements that should be fixed such as the weapon position and sword hit boxes. The dev seems active so maybe they will fix it, when they do I will update the review. This really is early access, not sure why it's not.UPDATE: The dev is highly active in fixing the game. The recent test patch/upcoming patch has solved enough performance issues that the game is well playable with out dipping the frame-rate below the 90fps/90hz. When it works it's a mayhem blast, slicing dicing and shooting is fun. For the low price that VR games arrive at I will recommend this one as when it comes to other options there are some seriously bad wave shooters out there, I have 2 hours in it already and I have yet to feel exhausted by it. I hope it only improves and we get more content."

They also mentionned adding new levels.  So I retract my previous statement of only buying if it's on sale.*ORIGINAL REVIEW: As seen in the trailer, the graphics and the physics of this game are very good; some of the best in VR.  However, it is a little repetitive.  Make sure you get it on sale."
76561197989413709,Not Recommended,543390,34625084,Posted: 30 August,all,Kazura,"This game has a LOTTTTTTTTTTTTTT of potential.Perhaps if they could just remove that goddamn **GET SHOT 5 TIMES ISH AND THATS IT YOU DIE** style and put in something like call of duty **BLOOD ON EYE** style?? Or maybe something like ZomDay life pattern with health packs everywhere??? Even Deadpool has **regeneration capacity**!!ALSO: THE BULLET TIME IS USELESS IF YOU CANT SHOOT WHILE IN BULLET TIME. OKAY FINE USE THE SWORD, BUT WHAT GOOD IS THE SWORD THAT BUGS OUT ALL THE TIME???Common man, VR is suppose to be fun, not stressful like in real life! Unless this game is perfected like Sairento, dont bother with it."

76561198130785717,Recommended,543390,32001148,Posted: 27 May,all,No Faux,"I will be changing this review to positive once the game has been worked on more but it wasn't quite ready for beta. At least from my prospective . The game will be incredible, It's fun but there is a ton of input lag and very little options in settings to fix some of these issues. I have an i7, 32 gb of ram, 980 ti and an ssd.  Almost top of the line, If you have a 1080 or 1080 ti it may run fine for you. Please keep it up Developers. It's an incredible game but just not fun for me due to input lag and jitteriness.**UPDATE**  - Developer Responded within a very very short peroid and is on the issues. Game is great."

76561198124516461,Recommended,543390,32000309,Posted: 27 May,all,bigtroy1114,"This game has some of the best graphics and physics I've seen in VR, but definitely needs more optimization on the second level.With some updates this game could become a ""must have ""."
,Recommended,543390,31943953,Posted: 24 May,all,LeeFlippinGreene,I'm playing through the second level right now (each level seems to be about an hour a piece) and so far im loving it.the graphics are great and the tracking is spot on most of the time. I like that it predicts your legs placement as well because it helps with the immersion. I got this game during sale (35% off) and it is totally worth it at that price. I'f i had tried this before buying i'd probably say its worth full retail price as well.
,Not Recommended,543390,34409240,Posted: 21 August,all,Obergruppenführer,"BEFORE YOU READ THIS REVIEW: If you find this review less than helpful then please leave a comment why.Problems so far:-Absolute ear♥♥♥♥♥♥at the start of any mission.-Characters head is much bigger than the player's.-Enemy bullets pierce THROUGH enemies without warning.-Enemy's aim is impeccable and if not in slow motion they will not miss unless you dance around like a monkey making the game virtually unplayable.-Difficulty does not affect the enemy's aim.-Game is incredibly hard even on the lowest setting.-Sword slashes rarely even register as hits.-Dying usually results in ear♥♥♥♥♥♥-It takes a solid 3.5 seconds for time to slow down after dashing.-Slow motion is required at all times to make winning even feasible.-It's near pointless to use swords because if there is one enemy with a gun and a few melee enemies, the armed enemy will proceed to shoot through the melee enemies killing you.-Often times the enemies will slash you despite having slashed them first.Pros:-You feel like deadpool if you get lucky enough with your shots and listen to the right music.If there were any sort of 'cheat' menu I would 100% change this review in a heartbeat. The game has an abundance of potential."

76561198063942102,Recommended,543390,31905964,Posted: 22 May,all,PS5Owner,"Game is awesome.  Blasting robots in slomo with one hand while slicing/dicing and plucking bullets out of the air with the other.Not a wave shooter. More like Doom where you move through the level, but you'll be clearing one spot at a time which works pretty well because you can prepare for what's coming next.FX are good too some of the best graphics I've seen in VR.Performance got an update I'm running smoothly 1080 +i7 1.2ss"
,Recommended,543390,33368936,Posted: 8 July,all,Shadow,"https://youtu.be/786YQxb-IfoNot quite what I was expecting but still enjoyable. A Reaper simulator, bullet time, gun kata, mobile wave shooter.The IK is a nice touch but still a bit finicky. It's difficult to get it perfect. I would have appreciated a calibrate option instead of feeding in manual values. It's a better showing than most other games though.The biggest issue was the sound tbh. The bullet sounds were waaaaay too loud. They drown out all other sounds and made it difficult to determine where enemies were landing.The sword felt mostly useless as an offensive weapon. It was fun to slice and dice enemies that got too close but I think it's mainly for defending against rockets/bullets you can't dodge.It looks like there was a patch a couple days ago after I did this review that added in locomotion a couple levels and new enemies. Keeping this short and might do a second look soon."

76561197960400151,Not Recommended,543390,33094870,Posted: 1 July,all,Mister Nubbles,"This game is NOT worth $5, much less $20.  I don't normally write reviews, but I had to say some things about this game.  There are reviewers on here stating this game is like Robo Recall with swords.  The sword mechanics are completely broken.  If you're not swinging as fast as a professional baseball player, the sword just goes right through anything you're swinging at without touching it.  It's nigh impossible to hit bullets with the sword and rockets are untouched by them.  You have to hit rockets with two bullets to explode them, but they move so fast (even in ""slow-time) that you're lucky to do anything before they hit you.  The worst part is there is no situational awareness in this game.  It literally just spawns enemies in 360 degrees all around you without any signs of the enemy being there.  You can look to your left and see nothing down a long hallway then turn and look to the right only to get immediately punched or shot by a new enemy that spawned right beside you to your left.  Of course, you won't know you're getting hit to the left or barely even getting hit from anywhere because there is no indicator that you're being hit aside from a quick red flash of the screen.  You have no idea which direction the hit is coming from, so you find yourself in slow bullet time just spinning in circles trying to figure out where the bullet (or fist) came from.  The aim is completely off where you're firing over the head of everything if you're trying for a headshot.  I had to aim at the center of their chests to hit them in the head.  Oh, and even on ""easy mode"", if you don't hit their heads, be prepared to unload your entire magazine into one enemy to take them out.  Your arms feel like they're stuck to your ears in the game instead of down where they should feel.It's possible a lot of the tracking/aiming/arms placement issues are due to me using the Oculus instead of the Vive, so I'll change my review here if that's the case and an Oculus support patch is released that's better.This game feels very much like an alpha release and I wouldn't recommend it for anybody until it's polished a LOT."
