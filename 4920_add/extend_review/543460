76561198137168455,Not Recommended,543460,33787049,Posted: 25 July,all,jontheoverlord,"I can’t believe how off the mark they were with this gameNow I’ve finally played this game (thanks to the summer sale, and thank you Lord Gaben for the discounts you bestow upon me). I can’t believe that they thought this was even remotely a good Idea! It’s a hollow, shallow, superficial game with no atmosphere and a horribly confused tone.Its combat is so unintuitive but also dumbed down at the same time. You can’t throw melee weapons or hit enemies with your gun or hit with throwable items and no auto lock-on with your firearm like in the previous games. Right at the start, the combat feels lazy, the zombie violence feels like a controlled, irritating chore because there are so many Zombies, unless you have some of these ridiculous combo weapons then it turns the action from a complete chore to a boring pile of nothing. The combat feels very unresponsive because there aren’t many round swings, most hit seem to go in awkward directions mostly diagonally and he takes too long to hit a zombie with most weapons.Now… Let’s talk about “Frank West” spoiler alert: HE IS AWFUL!Frank has been transformed into a completely unlikable scumbag who did nothing but incessantly irritate me. I don’t get what Capcom Vancouver were going for with this guy, the old voice actor TJ Rotolo was FINE!!!! Why did they really change him? because it totally isn’t for maturity purposes like they claim. Frank has been turned into a selfish, unfunny, constantly quipping, constantly self-praising, constantly ego-stroking, man-baby. HE MAKES CAR NOISES WHEN HE DRIVES CARS SOMETIMES FOR CRYIN’ OUT LOUD! Only a child would do something like that.The “horror mixed with humour” attempt is a complete FAIL!This game seems to think that the best way of combining horror with humour like the other games did is to have something horrifying or dramatic happen then following it up with “Frank” making an incredibly tasteless and insensitive quip! He basically does this throughout the entire game, the game never seems to want to let a horrific or dramatic moment pass without reminding you not to take it seriously, which ruins the atmosphere and tone! there things that do that throughout the whole gameStory and other charactersJust bad, none of them are likable or memorable, Vick is stupid and extremely annoying! Darcy isn’t funny! Brad is boring and forgettable! Paula’s “radio persona” makes me want to rip my hair out! As for the story, they decided to Retcon the story and the character of Dr Barnaby from DR1, even though even he died years and years ago in the games lore. The story is based around Barnaby wanting to use zombies as some way to achieve human immortality. There’s other bits and pieces like some guy gets accidently turned into some super zombie by the big bad guy company named “Obscuris” but WHO CARES?!?! There’s some rivalling survivor factions as well. BORING.Other things that need mentioningPsychopaths have been replaced with “maniacs” and they are PATHETIC!! No beginning or ending cutscene and their attacks are the same as “Franks” their AI is bad and they have no character.There are only 36 COMBO WEAPONS!! That is PATHETIC!! That’s less than Dead Rising 2 there were 50 in Dead Rising 2 and 100 in Dead Rising 3!. A lot of them are very unimaginative or stupidly overpowered or just worse copies of the combo weapons from previous games. The new thing in this game is “power Armor” IMPORTANT FACT: it’s temporary and you cannot use anything other than the weapons that are power Armor specific, so apparently when “Frank” puts on power Armor he forgets how to pick up and hold a gun!The port is WORSE THAT DR3 I DIDN’T EVEN THINK THAT WAS POSSIBLE!! It keeps crashing and has a lot of terrible performance, I only had 1 crash in DR3 but a lot of bad performance.There’s so much more to say but I think I’ll stop there… NOT RECOMMENDED!... it pains me to say all this as a big Dead Rising fan, but it’s true NOT RECOMMENED!!"

When I saw the trailer for this game, I was soooo excited as I'd never had the pleasure of experiencing a Dead Rising game before (although I had heard plenty about it). It appeared to be a real zombie apocalypse playground, one open to endless zombie and person killing possibilities - this is not what I got.You play the whole game feeling like you're still in a tutorial, and it becomes a constant wait for 'the real game' to start, but you eventually realise that this never happens. The difficulty options are also all over the place, and lets not even mention the 'real ending' dlc fiasco. Fortunately I won't experience that disappointment, as those let-downs that I've already met have resulted in me uninstalling this turd to make room for one of many superior games.If nothing else, this game manages to make killing hundreds of zombies en masse boring, and that is rather impressive..."
76561198024299389,Not Recommended,543460,30514054,Posted: 14 March,all,RetroRebus,"Some Background ContextI loved DR1 and DR2. I had the Megaman Cannon unlocked for DR1 and was Max Level. I loved DR2 and the setting of Fortune City, and i=I adored Snowflake the tiger.I could stomach DR3's poor story because I enjoyed arming my survivors to the teeth and mowing down legions of the dead. When Capcom said they were 'returning Dead Rising to it's roots' and that 'Frank is back!', I got excited for the fourth installment.========================================================================================================================================================================Frank is Back?DR4. DR4. I think if the main character was called anything other than 'Frank', there wouldn't be a problem regarding the protagonist. He's funny, witty, dry. I enjoy his humour and his cynnical disposition, BUT, he is not Frank West. In an attempt to pander to the older fans of the series - such as myself - they've shot themselves in the foot by not creating a new character and having optional audio files  from TJ Rotolo (Frank's voice actor in DR1).========================================================================================================================================================================SurvivorsDead Rising 4. The survivor-escort missions from DR1 and DR2 were 'streamlined' in DR3; you simply killed a horde of zombies around a character and they ran off and appeared in the various safehouses, where they could be recruited into the party and armed for combat. DR4 goes full retard and streamlines this proccess futher, as the survivors can no longer be taken on missions and armed. If anything, I was expecting a revamp to the system and make it much more interesting; maybe adding levels 1 - 5 to survivors so you had incentive to rescue them. Shame.========================================================================================================================================================================The TimerThe timer in DR1 was enjoyable. Coupled with the escorting of potentially wounded survivors, the timer added a much-needed risk/reward style gameplay. I thoroughly enjoyed trying to get perfect runs where id save the majority of survivors and kill the majority of Psychopaths. Without it the game feels....without direction. The first two games' timers meant you could only spend a minute or two killing zombies at a time and so it wasnt worn out. Here (and in DR3) the lack of time constraints mean you're encouraged to kill hordes of the dead (as there's F all else to do). This makes fighting the zombies boring after a few minutes.========================================================================================================================================================================HealthThe replacement of the 'Health Chunks' from DR1 and DR2 means that instead of losing 1 chunk of health per time zombies bite you, you now have a numerical health value that slowly degrades as you walk past zombies and they flail their arms around. Couple this with an abundance of healing items placed at every turn and it's difficult to die.========================================================================================================================================================================Weapon Placement and Combo WeaponsWhen I saw the devs say Dead Rising was 'going back to it's roots', I thought less ridiculous combo weapons and more emphasis would be placed on finding weapons like in DR1 and DR2. Having knowledge of the katana and UZI whereabouts in Paradise Plaza in DR1 or the LMG in the Yucatan Casino in DR2 made you feel rewarded for learning the various weapon placements. Also, these weapons where extremely deadly to zombies and Psychopaths alike.Combo weapons were introduced in DR2, but instead of them being the main focus, they were more of a novelty. Here in DR4, the combo weapons are your main source of damage dealing and this really doesnt sit well with me. I dont mind having an electrical axe, but I would much prefer it if it was a novelty item placed in one location that you would pick up everytime you drove through said location; not your Go To weapon once you learn the combo for it.========================================================================================================================================================================Psychopaths?The Psychopaths in DR1 and DR2 were more fun than the actual story missions. Finally killing Cletus or Adam the Clown was a great feeling the first time around as they usually killed me several times before I learned how to best them. In DR4 there are no Psychopaths, instead they are replaced by 'Maniacs'. Maniacs are a group of enemies - usually dressed in a particular theme - that attack in waves and once a few waves have been defeated you can battle their boss - which looks identical to the other Maniacs - and then you're done. No interesting cutscenes showing how warped they've become by the apocolypse. No character depth. Just a mob of baddies and you're done, completely forgettable.========================================================================================================================================================================In Conclusion...Other than various nitpicks and peresonal preference, the game runs at 60fps the majority of the time, and dips down into the low 40s randomly for no apparant reason, however I'm sure a patch will fix this in a week or two.I despise how lazy the story writing is. Sneak into a military base? The gate is wide open and the guards are nowhere in site. Locked keypad? Use a hacking filter on the camera to bypass it.Whether or not you like this game will come down to whether you enjoyed DR3 primarily over DR1 and DR2... There is definitley fun to be had here. The humour is hitting all the right notes. There is real weight and impact to each melee attack now thanks to a small vibration on the xbox controller.For me personally, I wish they had focused more on survivors and a new protagonist. Hank East for christ sake. I would've prefered the combo weapons to be toned down compared to DR3, not ramped up. I would've really enjoyed seeing multiple factions fight over different areas on the map, and being able to join in on these fights depending on who I personally believed was right. I feel the game is too easy. A 10-year-old could easily play and complete this.As Rick would put it; ""This, this is not a game for smart people Jerry,"". Get Swhifty Capcom."

No time limit no psychos, less weapons, cant throw any object anymore!  PHEW!  Where have you been all my life.  JUST KIDDING!  I hate what the NEW team from Capcom Vancouver has done and guess what they all got fired.  DO YOUR RESEARCH next time and stop wasting peoples time."
,Not Recommended,543460,33716575,Posted: 22 July,all,Crack Addict Conflict,Got bored of it in 9 hours. It's just not that interesting. Other dead rising games were better.It's not like any of the dead rising games. It's just plain zombie smashing trash. It's limited in what u can do.
,Not Recommended,543460,30566197,Posted: 17 March,all,CyanideCandy,"I usually don't do reviews but the way this game was handled, I feel like I have to say something about it.Dead Rising 4 was something I was looking forward to for a while, it looked decent from the commercials and the way Frank looked from the art I was seeing at the time, I thought this looked good. Frank is back finally, what could go wrong?Though when actually playing the game, the character they call ""Frank West"" is nothing like the one they had established in the previous games, it was just a stranger with the same name and profession. He has a lot of really bad one liners in the game and most of his personality is based on them. They also threw out any kind of character developement they had on him from the previous games as well and replaced it with a cheap imitation instead.The gameplay itself still has you running and completing tasks, though they take out timed missions which were fun. Back then they gave you tasks spread through out the day and encouraged you to manage your time wisely, though in this game, you're to only do the main story and find survivors whose only purpose in the game is to level up your safehouse which isn't really worth leveling up. The safehouse is used as a way to buy everything you need if you don't feel like looking for the exact same items you can find outside the small safe haven, they also have items which puts markers on collectibles, but everything the safehouse provides, you can easily find outside the safehouse if you go and look for a bit.The item menu was peculiarly bad though, you aren't given one but an inventory for items you can throw(you can not throw all items though, only a few which the game allows you to), items you can use as melee weapons and items you can shoot with. Along with a small inventory for health items, food can be used but they no longer have different health benefits as far as I noticed and you can't combine them, which made me pretty depressed a bit since I found that part fun but they decided to ditch that altogether in this game.As for enemies, the psychopaths are gone and replaced with stronger normal enemies who can talk and give a small speech before proceeding to try and kill you. There's no backstory to them or any special music which makes them unique. They're really just small obstacles and you don't get anything particurlarly worth while for killing them even. You'll miss out on nothing if you decide to ignore them.However the clothing is back, though it doesn't seem too interesting as it was in the previous games and you can't horrify your friends with the most ridiculous outfit you can make because the game lacks co-op mode for the campaign. Even though there's a multiplayer mode, they take out clothing options in that altogether. The multiplayer in this has the players following a series of tasks and then given a score at the end. There's really no co-operation to it at all and seems more like a badly thought out party game.I really don't think the series has a future after this game but I could be wrong, there could maybe be a Dead Rising that blows all expectations and has everyone loving it. Anyways, I'd avoid this game if you have any expectations of it being like the previous games but I'd say go for it if you're just buying it to kill zombies, alone, because of the lack of co-op."

No psychos like the last games... no getting characters to follow you around and bringing them to a safe room... nope.. just they literally walk 5 feet away and disappear if u manage to save them.Game is like a huge backward step for the series. Go play dead the first 3.. enjoy those... this one was more like a chore then a game.

,Not Recommended,543460,30808455,Posted: 29 March,all,BeesKneesMcGee,"I REALLY wanted to like this game, I really did. But they took the Dead Rising IP and made it an entirely different game. Psychopaths aren't a thing anymore, Frank West isn't Frank West, your camera isn't the fun PP generator it was in DR1 and you're not even timed anymore. It's just a linear, dull zombie killing simulator. I'm praying the DLC will make it a little better but I'm not keeping my hopes up too high. If you're new to Dead Rising, I recommend 1/2. 3 is alright as well, but 1 and 2 are THE TRUE dead rising games. 5/10"
,Not Recommended,543460,30625858,Posted: 19 March,all,Fluffy Haired NEET,"It feels bad not being able to recommend this since I love the series (Excluding 3 and this sorta), but I cant recommend this at all if you are a hardcore fan of the series, and if you're a newcomer or regardless of whether or not you loved Dead Rising 3 I persionally wouldn't recommend it now until the Frank Rising DLC comes out. But thats getting ahead of myself, so lets talk about why DR4 is good before we talk about why its a let down.The GoodThe color is back, which is nice after how greybrown Dead Rising 3 wasThey brought back the mall, bringing back the relaxing mix of killing zombies while elevator music plays in the background really missing in 3.One of the few games I can think of outside of Parasite Eve, and Yakuza 1/2/5 which takes place around Christmas.Devs are FINALLY listening to feedback instead of terrible Valve-tier playtesters and have added in multiple difficulty settings and I recommend playing on hard if you want a challenge.No more weapon lockers which stripped away some challenge in 3Killing zombies is as enjoyable as it has always been in the series, and DR is still my favorite personal zombie action seriesStory at least interested me more than DR3 to see it through to the end even though its still not great as the original or the entire DR2 sagaThe BadRuns only slightly better than Dead Rising 3Character models can look uglyCamera doesn't really have much purpose outside of investigation missions, unless you complete some faux-achievements it doesnt level up your character making the score system feel redundant.The controls have been changed, apparently to make things more convenient because they were apparently bad before (?). I thought they worked great, they still work fine here but there is a pointless ""stealth"" button which you will never ever need to use.Killing zombies is still treated as a focus rather than a side activity or something that stands in your way.Characters are either forgettable or completely obnoxiousMall itself doesnt feel large compared to DR1 or DR2's strip and you dont visit it much storywise in favor of a bland townSoundtrack outside of ""Oh WIllamette"" and mall music is forgettable industrial/orchestra music like DR3 largely hadTHE UGLYClaims that they're going back to their roots though nowhere near as misleading as other franchises ""RESIDENT EVIL 6 WILL BRING THE FRANCHISE BACK TO ITS ROOTS"", still feels like marketer speak as the game feels less similar to the original than ever.The game still feels like it has been severely dumbed down to appeal to either a ""wider audience"" or some braindead retard reviewers (Looking at you Official Xbox Magazine)No multiple endings, only the one disappointing one all players getTJ Rotolo has been replaced by Ty Olsson, credited as Victor Nosslo. He's not a bad DR character but he just isnt Frank West.Survivors are all generic. There's no real motivation to rescue them, there are no interesting side stories outside of audiologs/journals you find, its nowhere near as interesting as in prior gamesThe equivalent of Overtime Mode, the True Ending scenario, is being sold as $15 DLC and still has no release date. Considering that Overtime Modes generally werent long this is worrying unless they make up for it hardManiacs have been put in place in favor of psychopaths. They have no intro/outro, no interesting music, no interesting attack patterns, they're just basic hostile survivors with larger health bars and feel like very last second additions.Like its still a solid title if flawed and there is certainly fun to be had, but so much charm has been removed from the prior games for no reason, outside of one developer claiming that its so there can be sequels. Ironically they've alienated so much people that there might not be a DR5, the series is at risk of going extinct like Lost Planet or DMC after the terrible reboot. The impression I also got feels more like ""We love DR but we would rather make anything else"" as evident from the amount of Street Fighter items you can find in the game. Its hard not to dog on this game and I want Capcom Vancouver to succeed, but this is debatably the lowest point in the series, and they really need to re-examine what made DRs 1 and 2 so great. As of now it feels more like open world Zombie Dynasty Warriors or Zombie EDF, which is fine for some but it isnt what made me love the series."
76561197970684895,Not Recommended,543460,30516951,Posted: 14 March,all,Dratz,"Whining ahead.....Just...no. I enjoyed the previous games. But this one is an extreme example of the continued trend to make formulaic nerfed across the board console games, and then port them to PC. If you keep the game slap stick style, and over the top with humor, I can excuse the graphics. But the attempt to make it gritty, dark, and even edgier than the previous, without deadpooling the hell out of the dialogue and gizmos? Even turned all the way up the games looks mediocore. The blur motion effects, coupled with the mood lighting means you don't see the detail. And while I didn't look or try to toy with camera controls, the default distance is basically a foot behind Frank's head.I thought I remember seeing an interview about weapon blueprints going away. You find stuff, you can immediately trying throwing it all together to mesh weapons of mass explosive dilduction. But no. Same script. Same exact weapons, materials, and even the mall which has less detail than an early 2000 mmo.  Maybe a few more hours into it the game changes and gives you freeeeeeeeeedom. But in the first couple hours it feels like you paid for a new Star Trek / Dr Who, but got the 70s version. Who the hell play tested this??I'll wait until this game is under $10 before revisiting it.Frame rate seemed good tho. So there's that"
,Not Recommended,543460,30586169,Posted: 18 March,all,Manchester VLG,"Remember Fallout 4? The same drastic change there is the same here. Dead Rising 4 followed the same forumla that 3 started and just got worse.Every survivor and zombie worked at the mall for some reason because everyone is either an elf, gingerbread man, or snowman so no more notebook or interesting characters.They took out the timer and made it go by ""episodes"" and made the game very easy and shorter than 3.No physcopaths, instead we have ""maniacs"" that die easily and have a boss that doesn't seem any different from the cronies.In conclusion this game is NOT a ""Back to the roots of Dead Rising"" as Capcom claimed and sadly I belive this is the end of this franchise but atleast we have a good run up to Dead Rising: OTR.5/10"
76561197987003469,Not Recommended,543460,30570505,Posted: 17 March,all,Plebber,"The game's graphics look okay, but that's pretty much all it has going for it. Since everything which made the series unique has been stripped away, or dumbed down to appeal to a more casual audience.Your inventory is now divided into 4 parts, one which holds your melee weapons, one which holds your ranged weapons, one which holds grenades and other throwable weapons, and the last which holds healing items.In contrast to the previous games you are not able to throw any item other than specific ones such as grenades or tomahawks.The healing items has lost their purpose because as far as I can tell they all heal the same amount, meaning you would heal the exact amount of health by consuming a back of snacks (healed 1 block of health in previous games) than you would do if you consumed  orange juice (replenished 4 blocks of health in previous games). With the exception of the last healing item you have picked up there is no way to organize them. The health system has been replaced by a bar and a number for no reason other than appealing to the most common denominator I guess.The same weird and casualized weapons combining system which was introduced in Dead Rising 3 is still in this game, where if you took a small wooden mallet and a box of nails you could combine them into a baseball bat with a bunch of knives and sawblades stuck on it, in short the combinations usually do not care what kind of item you are holding but rather checks what kind of type they have been assigned by the developer. However this combo would only be available if you found the specific plans for it. Combining any sort of weapons is a no-go unless you have found the specific blueprint for that specific weapon. This removes the point of the combo weapons Dead Rising 2 implemented in my opinion, where the point was to make very weak items you would normally not pick up into something useful.Unless you have found a decent melee weapon combo blueprint there is little to no reason to use melee weapons as the range weapons are overpowered. Where melee weapons take at least 2 hits on hostile survivors, guns 1 shots them if you hit them in the head (which is a very trivial task to perform) even on hard mode. You can be assured that there are plenty of guns too, as the vast majority of the hostile survivors carry guns, and you will be killing A LOT of hostile survivors when playing through the main story mission.There are 3 types of missions in this, the main story mission, events and maniacs. The only mission worth doing is the main story mission, as the events ones are mundane to annoying small tasks like clearing out a group of zombies, destroy an atenna or loot a container. The rewards for these events are not worth the effort as it only gives you a small PP (exp) boost towards your leveling and upgrades your safehouse, which is pretty useless in itself. The safehouse contains different merchants who sell you healing items, weapons, vehicles and markers on your map for blueprints and other collectables. All these things can easily be found by just exploring a tiny bit. The most useful thing you may buy from the merchants is 1 weapon blueprint for each safehouse.The maniacs are essentially just a dumbed down and lazy version of the psychopath bosses from previous games. They are a bunch of hostile survivors wearing a specific theme of clothing with one person using a different weapon and having more health than the others. These missions do not provide any sort of useful reward other than the weapon the slightly buffed guy is holding.Frank West is back, but that is in name only. The character named Frank West in this game does not resemble the Frank West in previous titles. The new ""Frank West"" is an generic, old, cynical man who spouts a bunch of one liners, which I again suspect is an attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator.The story at one point tries to build up to something big and scary, but quickly falls flat as the ""big and scary"" thing turns out to not be as big and scary as they try to make it out to be.Despite being a poor installment of the Dead Rising series, I wouldn't recommend it as a standalone game either. As there is little to nothing to do outside of the main story missions, which is quite lacking in itself.The game is riddled with game breaking bugs. At 2 different times did I have to reload a checkpoint because either a friendly survivor I had to follow was stuck circling an area endlessly, or a hostile survivor I had to kill with a melee weapon was stuck in a running animation on a railing I couldn't access. Or I killed all the zombies near a survivor during an event, she gave me the voicelines for completing the task, but I never received any of the rewards and the marker for the event was still there.The devs also seemed to forget that they even implemented a stealth option for Frank, since if you press the key to search a bag while crouching Frank will either enter an endless walking cycle when he gets to the bag or just stand completely still and look at it without performing the search.The stealth option is also a completely useless feature which grants you little to no benefits compared to just gunning everyone down instantly (the only exception being one place towards the end filled with a bunch of powerful zombies).All in all Dead Rising 4 is a lacking game which only seems to target the lowest common denominator with a ton of marketing like the regular AAA games tend to be.If you are really hungry for a zombie game and despite all this still want to go for it I'd recommend waiting until it is on sale and heavily discounted."

Played it from start to finish and there are some things I like about it but mostly dislike. The one thing I hated about this game was the so-called ""investigation"" missions. It takes a bizarre pause in the game flow and you just snap random pictures in a room to progress the story. The story is rather predictable and unoriginal too.There's no psychos, story, or anything that really made this anything like the original Dead Rising game. There are ""special"" zombies in this game as well which makes the game really annoying, in my opinion and just cheap hack and slash instead of feeling like a reporter trying to uncover a massive conspiracy.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. You might have to get it as a Dead Rising fan but don't expect much."

Throw items is gone (Throw your weapons, chair or any ramdon stuff you found) before you could rescued survivors and make your own crew to help you, this one doesn't have that. Btw some people were hoping for better graphics (I know graphics dont make a good game but honestly this graphics are more cartoonish compared to DR3).- The story is short, the game is easy to play, there is less blood, the weapons are lame, and overall it feels like a short PG13 game.

Everything that made the game unique has been dumbed down to a simple formula. survivors are a random encounters that are all seemlessly the same thing by the second one. psychopaths are now called maniacs and are as easy as the looters from dead rising 2 but besides being easy they feel bland and the opening cutscene and music that got you hyped you from the first game is not their. Weapons are overly rediculous but they tried to simplify it so multiple items can be crafted together making a bland game with weapons that dont even try to make sense ruining any sense of immersion that the orginal game brought. The game is buggy still and I expect some of it to be patched but from what I can tell the developers of this game were trying to make a simple game and followed examples of other failing games and ruined the dead rising series. Why bring back a beloved charactor and ruin the game he was from.

I remember spending hours driving up and down the parking garage in the first Dead Rising to get the megaman blaster. I remember dying over and over again only to come back with better stats and to try again. Escorting the survivors was stressful and demanding when the series first started and thats what I loved. Life outside would get boring and I needed something to really throw my time at to know I wasn't a let down working some stupid job I should probably work on to better myself. Screw that noise I'm here with my guy Frank West and we are going to kick some zombie♥♥♥♥♥and get the best shots doing it.This game is much like playing Halo 3 for hours on end, weapon drops and vehicles that were just made for epic fights, and then going to Halo 5 where they cut all of that out and just give it to you. Dead Rising 4 got rid of a lot of the things that made the series what it is. Psychos that would often be harder than the bosses in the story line and they would give you amazing perks for wasting that extra time (since the clock was always ticking!). They are so downgraded in this game they are regular people with a weapon or ability they might use once or twice. They don't even have crazy stories behind them anymore.Survivors are another feature of the series. Throughout the series you'd have interesting people to save and often they would give you a hard time and have you jumping through hoops just so you could escort them to safety and not worry about them anymore. Again it was always rewarded for wasting precious time (BECAUSE TIME WAS LIMITED!!!!) and they would give you extra perks. Wether it wasplaying poker and knocking them all out of the game,peeling them out of a tanning booth and carrying them,or even after defeating them as a psycho fightit was crazy fun, it was a pain to arm them all up and bring them to the safe house, and it was amazingly fun to do it all. The survivors in this game are merely random encounters, they just stand there in a horde of zombies screaming for help, and often times they are next to a giant horde that begins to trickle into the area and have to be killed as well. Sometimes it can take more time because they were seemingly carelessly placed on the map. Once you clear the area around them they drop an item sometimes useful and then they just take themselves to the shelter. Not once do they have you going to other random areas around the map, opening secret passages, or doing crazy chores.Then they took out the timer completely. This is both good and bad. I can now fiddle fart around with the map and do whatever I want to do without worry. At the same time, it cuts out a lot of the worry about if I'll have time to kill this maniac, collect these items, and still make it to the story placement in time for the right ending. It's not a big impact, but it does cut out a lot of what the other games would do.Last...there is no over time. It really sucks to see a company fall into the seasonal pass scheme that every other game company is doing now. There is a DLC now for $10 if you want to see the real ending, the entire thing can be done in about 30 minutes. They had so many features in the first game, as they continued making them they continued to do less and less. DR2's game show multiplayer was a good addition, but seasonal passes became the norm for every game and they knew they could continue milking your wallet.TL;DRWith as big and beautiful as this game is they removed a lot of the old features of past games and replaced it with shoddy characters and miscellaneous encounters were very bland, Frank West didn't deserve this."

This is the loading screen for the cutscene. Other than that, if you have not touched any of the other games, this game is a pretty solid game, althought still not worth close to 60 to 70 dollars with DLC.

76561197970516356,Not Recommended,543460,33358452,Posted: 7 July,all,RedShirt,"Dead Rising 4 loses a lot of what made the previous Dead Rising game so entertaining.  The open world loses a lot of personality compared to the casinos in DR2 or even the city in DR3.  Each section of the world seems only superficially detailed, it's either mall, stores, or houses with very little personality.  It feels as if the content is stretched out to make the game area larger without making it more interesting.The crafting system is probably the largest downgrade from previous Dead Rising games.  While there are a number of weapons to create, virtually all of them require very specific components that are only found in a small number of places.  Want to use a boxing glove weapon again?  You have to find a tree topper or a holiday bell to make them compared to just needing a bladed weapon in DR2.  Weapons that were in previous Dead Rising games are missing and there are many items which cannot be used in crafting at all.The game would have been much improved if they had let you use categories of weapons to craft rather than needing specific items so much, as it is now, you're essentially limited to a handful of weapons that have easy to find components while the other fifty or so weapons are unused.  Vehicle crafting is similarly limited with only a couple of vehicles readily available.The game does address the lack of available crafting items by letting you buy combo weapons and vehicles from survivors in shelters.  But this takes away a lot of the charm of Dead Rising which is feeling like you're surviving on your own with whatever tools you have at hand.  Instead it feels like a standard open world game where you look for collectibles, grind for money, and go back to base to resupply before doing it all over again.I purchased the game on sale for half off, but I would not recommend DR4 if you still haven't played any of the other Dead Rising games.  This is aside from the loss of features such as a time limit and large amounts of replayability that have slowly been stripped out of the games."

The back story is actually conflicting with the original DR1 and felt very shallow. Plot point doesn't make much sense and motive behind characters is vague and stupid. In the story, most character played a minimal involvement to the progression of the story and they just felt one dimensional. DR serie does have a silly/unrealistic plot behind them, but the story in DR4  is just straight up bad. The ending is horrible and anticlimatic. I mean Frank West beat an intelligent zombie in a bloodly power armor, then just die to a random horde of zombie that seeming popped out of nowhere. Come on! Oh wait, that's not the ending? and you have to pay for true ending in a future DLC? I guess this is typical Capcom for you now a daysThe gameplay is bad as well. the skills and moves you can perform in previous game are either removed or dumbed down. Instead, you have a skill check every now and then, where you just have to to press a button to instantly kill a zombie. The problem is that this check come mostly at random, so there is little control over combat action. The new stealth mechanic is pretty much useless as well, since there are no scenario where you need to use it. And because the enemy is soo weak and dumb, being stealthy don't feel rewarding at all. The new power armor feature sounds like a cool idea on paper but it is poorly implentment into the game. Aside from the main story, power armor sorta acts like a mario super star. The problem is that there are nothing in particular interesting to fight with the power armor. Kill zombie? raider? military? Aside from evolved zombie and the military in power armor, you can pretty much one shot your enemy with a combo weapon anyway, so power armor seems like an overkill. The Boss fight are very generic and simple, they just hit abit harder and have more health, but you can still mow most of them down just by smashing your mouse or controller. it is just too easy, you don't really need to dodge for anything just attack. It doesn't make much sense when the elite zombie (evolved zombie) will put up more of a fight than some bosses. The game also has no side quest and lack psychopath encounter unlike the previous games(DR3 also suffer the similar problem but it is still feels better than DR4 for some reason). Scripted survivors event/quest are also gone, and now there's just randomly genenate encounters that felt very repetitive.The game also have very little replay value, since it doesn't have alternate endings to it. Or an alternate game mode. Leveling design also felt alittle out of place, because in a regular run, you are just going to hit lvl 50ish at the end of the story. The problem is that's about the half way point to unlock all your talents.. Unless you are a hardcore item collector and explore the everywhere and finish everything that you could possible do plus quite a bit of grinding, You are not going to the level cap. And since there are little to none replay value, you won't be going back to play the game again if you finish leveling.  Multiplayer uses the same leveling system as the story mode, except you have to choose one of four character and start the leveling process all over again. Great.....  /facepalm . The scenrio you will play in multiplayer are very similar to that of the story, it kinda feel like if you are roleplaying a zombie survivor game in a theme park.In previous DR games, most objects in the world are interactable, in DR4 alott of these interactable items in previous game are just evironments. It also makes no sense that a 10 years old game has better physics than its current counterpart. The attention to detail in DR 4 is no where as good as DR 1. They also removed the time system in the game, i understand why some people don't like it. But i love the time system in previous game, it give you a sense of urgency and challenge you to finish stuff on time. It really make you feel like you are playing a survival game, and the time is ticking, it felt more real. The changes they made to the interface also made the game felt more generic. Personally, i don't mind the change to the healthbar, it doesn't affect the gameplay all that much. But it is the change they made to the inventory that made the game felt generic. Now all the items are divided into throw weapon, melee weapon ,range weapon and food. Item share inventory space with items of the same catagories. But it also limit what you can do with all the items. Now you can't throw whatever you want. Now it just feels like any other game out there, you pick a catagory of weapon from a inventory wheel and replenish your health by food/medicine chargel.Overall, the open world gameplay is just very boring, the lack of contents made the world felt really empty. There are nothing really worth to explore anyway, you don't have to go back to the same place as well (except a few quest areas and road between regions).  The enemy varities are very limited as well. There are only 3 types of zombies: Normal, fresh and evolved zombie(Really felt like if they took inspirations from other zombie survival genre like dying light, especially on the way fresh and evolved zombie behaved). Two types of raiders, melee and ranged. And military units in power armor and non power armor varient that are in melee and ranged plus flamethrower(power armored only) configuration. All of these enemies are very easy to kill (except the evolved zombie, since it keep jumping around so it is hard to hit them). The supposed highlight of the game, the comdy also felt very forced, i don't really find it to be funny at all. And spending a good portion of the story fumbling with camera to search for evidences are not fun either.It might seem that i am putting the previous games(1,2) on a pedestal and overcritical about this game. But i really think that this game is really dull to play and don't have much going for it. Especially when they advertise it as going badck to their old root. Then of course will judge the game with exceptation i developed from previous games. I think the developor misunderstood what made the DR1&2 fun (DR1 still felt better than DR2, although DR2 was a fun game). They removed what i liked about DR serie and added in stuff that i found unnesserary. I really think they went on the wrong direction with the game, placing too much emphasis on the over packed zombie horde and killing zombie with ridiculus fashions. It just doesn't feel like if you are struggling to survive while investaging the truth behind the zombie outbreak. And before you judge me as being nostalgic for the old games. I just want to say that i was expecting something that resemble a sequel to the origional game, and that's what they have advetised it. They failed to deliver what i liked about the old game. of course i am dissapointed. I was already dissapointed with DR3, and now i am with DR4.So let's score the game. i am going to give this game a 1.5I would recommand you not to buy this game, but instead purchase the dead rising 1 & 2. You will actually have fun play these two games than playing DR4."

The 4th one looks so promising (i've managed to beat it while getting most of the collectables on normal). And to be clear I like the 4th for entirely different reasons than the 1st & 2nd, they're very different games. the 4th is more item collectable based while in the 1st & 2nd ones you were more herding survivors.And while that's all well in good to be different, it is literally unplayable with all the crashes and lag. It it seems to have gotten worse over time. All of my computer specs are well over the minimum requirements suggested for the game to run, yet it continues to spazz out frequently. Some of the maniac missions completely glitch out and won't let you complete them despite you having killed everyone in a 500 metre radius (i'm looking at you pirates). It's crashed atleast 5 times while playing the main storyline, sometimes it will remember the things your collected or did other times it will throw you back to two missions ago.Multiplayer is infuriating by how laggy it is, particularly when it is timed and jumping puzzles are impossible because of how much your character bounces all over the place. and I do mean bounce, you will be walking/running/hopping along and then your suddenly 4 feet backwards and off to the side of where you were initally. It also seems to bounce you straight into a pile of zombies right across the room from where you were. And that's just when I was playing by myself in multiplayer; when someone joins me the loading screens go to a complete stand still. And the lag teleporting whips you all over the place to the point were it's headache inducing.Would not recommend until they've patched/updated/fix it more-pickle"

The trailers show a dude running around a mall killing zombies, but the game I played was nothing like that.  It was nothing like anything, really.  It had no graphics or sound and was basically just a black screen.  I thought maybe the game wasn't working or something but I tried restarting Steam and my PC and the game was still just a black screen, so I guess that's what the game is.  I repect the developers' vision but this is a bit too avant garde for me.  I like a bit of interactivity in a game, some action, maybe some graphics and sound to give me an idea of things that are happening, but this game didn't have any of that.  Even though I only paid $23 for this, I will most likely be getting a refund.  I'm surprised that at one point they charged $60 for this game, I wonder if people realized you could replicate the experience by turning off your computer/monitor?"

,Not Recommended,543460,34662484,Posted: 1 September,all,Optimus_Mega,"I've considered a lot before writing this review; Is this game a cash grab or is thiis game just flat; is this game worth the price of admission or is it overpriced; is Frank West just being used to make money? From what I understand from the plot, Frank West is on a new expedition rather than surviving a zombie Outbreak. The element of time wouldn't matter so much in these circumstances but time elements could have definitely played a role in this game. When I think about The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask and how it used random events over a timed 3 day period, I wonder why this game didn't do the same with saving survivors or somewhat important events to the story. I guess the popular assesment that this game was simply a cashgrab is more conducive to the flat feel of this game.I myself have fun with every horror game, good or bad. There really isn't a bad Horror in my opinion, since it is all about the imagination. This game falls more in line with a ""Zombie Killer' which is a sub genre of horror that I like to call games like this. The Zombies are the horror but then again they're more like padding than a part of gameplay. Unlike previous games, I'm not afraid to run through a pack of zombies. The Zombies are way too weak, In comparison to the aformentioned zombie threat, Dead Rising Case Zero is a true Zombie Experience. Case Zero has greatly timed elements as well as a Zombie threat that makes running through a pack of them more on the line of fatal endeavor. Zombies in Dead Rising 4 are more or less easy kills because of the huge health bar and ridiculous weapons. After awhile the Zombies of Dead Rising 4 just seem to melt into the background as an annoying gameplay feature.The threat that makes this game a Horror is so weak that it isn't a Horror. When I imagine myself in Frank West's shoes with super strong weapons and a gigantic grip on life, I don't see why this game is something I could recommend people. There are some wonderfully awful Horror games out there like BadMojo, Resident Evil Survivor, and Obscure but Dead Rising 4 can't be considered among them because Dead Rising 4 is utterly flat. It's a bottle of Coke that has set out in the sun for 6 minutes and is now half warm and cold. Vomit inducing and good only at the beginning because you haven't tasted the samey flatness to come."

Pretty please?) i can atest that this is a faithful Dead Rising game that belongs on the franchise.This game has received allot of flak just because the voice actor that gives voice to Frank West is not the same as the one on the original Dead Rising... Though this might be a bit sad, Victor Nosslo does a pretty damn good job as Terence Rotolo did. Bashing the game just because the voice actor is not the same is just completelly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Now on to the game itself.The Dead Rising franchise, much like Devil May Cry, is not a series that must be taken seriously. The game itself is just one big joke and is cliched, cheesy and makes you roll your eyes whenever a bad come back pops up.The first Dead Rising was so bad in terms of acting that it was great... The old lady running after her dog and letting all the zombies in was just sooooo old (no pun intended) that it made me go ""figures....""Dead Rising 2 had the cliché of Chuck always having to get his daughter medicine every day and the survivors were just annoying ♥♥♥♥♥ each with their quirks... and it was awesome.Dead Rising Off the Record was the epitome of an awesome game by Capcom removing the timer and letting you frollic around and kill zombies at their own leisure... that was the most awesome thing ever.Dead Rising 3 brought us the most awesome combo weapons, vehicles and over a hundred zombies on screen at the same time.All these Dead Rising games have one thing in common: The story is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥.. A good kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥that makes you laugh and chuckle as you play. Also they are all for too easy... More difficulty settings, pl0x.Dead Rising 4 attempts to bring a little bit more mature storyline and combines what Frank West is supposed to be (A Photo Journalist) and the massive fun you get from mowing down hundreds of zombies with awesome combo weapons and/or an EXO Suit. Dead Rising 1 failed to use Frank West in what he was supposed to be and made the photos a total optional thing. By implementing actual journalistic investigation, it really immerses you when playing the game.Now the game itself has its share of buggs and glitches, most being because of its bad port to PC since it plays well on XBoX One but its nothing game breaking.The lack of manual save is a con but the constant checkpoints and autosaves make up for it.The only huge drawback in my opinion is the absence of Psychos and that made Dead Rising 1, 2 and 3 the huge hits when it came to boss fights.Combo Weapons are less than Dead Rising 3 but are more useful and powerful.Vehicles are more abundant and varied and have special attacks now.Firearms are more varied and useful but are also found in larger quantity and a bit more overpowered.You now have 3 tabs that house different kinds of weapons (Throwables, Melee and Firearms), a separate food tab and a dedicated grenade button... Most reviewers find this to be a negative aspect in the game and i say those people are complete idiots. If choice and variety are bad in a game than walk away from videogames.Video Settings are extremely varied and boast a large variety of settings.Keybinds actually work unlike the PC port of Dead Rising 3.Last but not least, the skill trees are awesome, allowing to direct your character the way you want (You can get all skills at the end anyway but at least you some choice early game)All in All, this is a must have Dead Rising game but i dont recommend paying full price for it so wait for a summer sale or a price cut before getting it."

,Recommended,543460,30617145,Posted: 19 March,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"At the time when the series premiered in 2006, it would've been hard to believe that that Dead Rising would still be going strong over a decade later with its fourth installment. While the franchise gained a kickstart with witty photographer/journalist Frank West during the initial zombie outbreak in Willamette, Colorado, the second and third games made way for protagonists Chuck Greene and Nick Ramos respectively. Now, with Capcom heavily pushing the idea of going back to the series' roots, Frank West has made his return, and so has the town and infamous mall of Willamette.The game takes place 16 years after the events of the first Dead Rising, and a mere year after the outbreak in Dead Rising 3; the year is now 2022, during early December, and Frank is now a 52 year old college professor. After being tricked into revisiting Willamette by one of his students, Vick, the duo soon discover that the town is being used by the military as a massive zombie research facility. The pair escape, only for Frank to be approached by a ZDC agent known as Brad Park, who then convinces Frank to return once more to Willamette to investigate a new zombie outbreak that began on Black Friday. Frank's incentive? To have his name cleared and also to gain exclusive rights to the entire story.Dead Rising 4 is a game that you're either going to love or hate due to a plethora of contributing factors. Many purists are upset at the fact that Frank's voice actor has been changed, and many are unhappy about his new Bill Murray meets Michael De Santa character model. The dialogue is just as cheesy as it has ever been, and the seven chapter story isn't overly captivating, but it all gets the job done for a game that centers around mindless zombie slaughter. Another huge change is the removal of the 72 hour timer, which gets rid of unnecessary in-game stress and allows for an abundance of exploration leisure time. Capcom have also done away with all post-completion modes, as well as the highly favored co-op mode that was present in the last two titles.Instead of campaign co-op, this title features a multiplayer mode that can be done either solo or with 3 other people. It has four distinct episodes, wherein you and your buddies must kill X amount of zombies and complete various, menial tasks. In order to unlock combo weapons you need to complete trials, and you also gain PP to level up and distribute skill points as you do in the main game. Honestly, it's a very mundane addition to the series, and most players would've rather had co-op once again. In the future, Capcom should note to sticking with their campaign for this series and not venture into the unneeded multiplayer world.Along with the aforementioned changes, Capcom decided to nuke the well known Psychos from all of the previous titles. Long gone are the crazy, unique Psychos that we have even come to know and love by name, instead replaced with generic Maniacs that have no personality of their own. Even many of the bosses that are faced in Dead Rising 4 feel commonplace and they are without the eccentric personalities that made the series what it is today. Instead, we've been given ""mutated"" zombies, such as the fresh zombies which are faster than the normal ones, and evolved zombies that are even faster than the fresh ones. Around the town, you will also find various military personnel who have it out for you, with two special types being the EXO Suit military dudes and the flamethrower guys.Returning with the new release are combo weapons and vehicles and their respective blueprints. While some old favorites, such as the sledgesaw, return, most of these craftables are new, including the introduction of element-based items such as the flame sword, ice sword, and various weapons and vehicles that shoot snowballs. Many of the new items are based on holiday festivity, such as a wreathe that shocks zombies, a grenade launcher that jingles bells while shooting ornaments, and my personal favorite... a nutcracker helmet that shoots bullets while playing the nutcracker theme. Needless to say, the weapons are both fun and inspired, although the vehicles are rather lackluster; save for the go carts and their combinations.One of the innovations that Capcom has pushed with Dead Rising for is the new EXO Suit, which is basically mechanized armor that allows you to pick up heavier weapons like a giant axe, Gatling gun, and road signs, as well as find power-ups to transform the suit into an unstoppable zombie killing machine. The suit is just okay, and it's nothing to rave about, the biggest downside is that it just doesn't last long enough; in most non-story scenarios, the EXO Suit lasts for a couple of minutes at best after equipping it, and once its power depletes you also lose the upgrade that you found for it. Just like any other weapon in the game, it simply breaks and then ceases to exist at all until you find the next.Willamette is no longer just limited to the mall, and now you have free reign of the entire town which is split up into four sections. There's plenty to do so long as you are interested in completing trials, collecting blueprints, and gathering collectibles like newspapers, iPods, and cellphones. There are also random events that occur, but there are only four types; save the survivor from the zombies, save the survivor from the military, loot the military cache, and destroy the military equipment. While these events give you a good amount of PP that will help you level up fast, to the cap of 100, the only ones that are really worth doing are the ones with survivors... so long as you haven't completely upgraded your four safe-houses yet. Yes, each section of Willamette has its own safe-house where you can purchase weapons, vehicles, clothing, and collectible location maps, and each are leveled up by saving a certain amount of survivors.As far as optimization goes, this game has been running like a dream on my i7 6700k + GTX 1080 + 16GB DDR4 3000 RAM (full specs in my profile). With everything on ultra at 1080p, I found myself topping out at around 124 FPS, and seeing a low of 62 FPS, but having an overall average of 85-95 FPS at any given time. However, Capcom have still not ironed out the glitches in this title; more often than not, I found that Frank had lost his voice overs and I would need to exit to the main menu and then load my save to get his voice working again. Also, zombies love to get stuck in the walls and in other objects quite often, making them very hard to kill if they're required to die to say, save a survivor. It doesn't look like Capcom are going to be fixing these minor issues any time soon.While it's hard to recommend Dead Rising 4, it's also just as difficult to not recommend it. On one hand the game does have a vast amount of content that one can easily sink 20-30 hours into and still not completely finish everything, but on the other hand it's missing some core elements that made the franchise in to what it is today. The removal of the timer is a wonderful change for those who like to do things at their own pace, but Capcom have shot themselves in the foot by getting rid of campaign co-op, as well as not taking the time to create noteworthy enemies. If you're still on the fence as to whether or not to purchase this game, take into account all of the changes that the developer has made and go from there, otherwise I highly recommend waiting for at least a 50% off sale. If you haven't played Dead Rising 3 yet, grab that instead.Rating:3.5/5.0- Average, can take it or leave it.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

DR4 keeps the series' fun zombie killing, goofy sense of humor (the new Frank voice actor is great, but fans will probably not like him either)  and inventive weapon combinations. You still take photographs, and you still save the day in a well written (and funny) story with fun (if shallow) combat.If you're a hardcore fan who gets mad when his game is changed (and I get you, this just isn't one of my franchises where I'd care) then this isn't for you.

,Recommended,543460,30528561,Posted: 15 March,all,泥鰍小妹妹,"I came into Dead Rising 4 without any expectations. I've played the first Dead Rising, and wasn't a huge fan, really. Killing zombies was fun, but I've always disliked things with timers. I did play DR 2 or 3, and because I can't compare DR4 to either of those. It may be because of this that I'm enjoying DR4 so much. As other's say, it's not terribly difficult, but I'm still enjoying the large map, abundance of enemies to kill, and fun weapons to wield. Progression feels good with leveling happening at a satisfying and rewarding rate. Frank West's dialogue is well done, and the humor adds to the experience.Many of the negative reviews I've seen have come from people that have played the earlier installments and were expecting more of the same. I seem to be part of the new demographic that they're targeting, and I guess I'm happy for that.I very much enjoyed Dead Rising 4. There's a solid core plot, and many optional sidequests that appear for a limited amount of time. And completing all of these involves running around slaughtering the undead or psychopathic humans with almost any object in the world. You can also build combo weapons in order more easily dispatch your enemies.Combo weapons and vehicles allow for more ludicrous attacks. It's hard to express the satisfaction of taking out dozens of zombies at once with an axe taped to a sledgehammer, swung in insane circles. These gain extra Prestige Points when used on zombies, helping Frank to level up.I found that boss fights were a little better in Dead Rising 3, but they're still engaging and fun in Dead Rising 4. The fights can sometimes prove to be weird and unexpected, and that is a welcome feature. The autosave function is very good as well. The old DR games had terrible save features, and this game has perfected that feature. After spending 5+ hours with Dead Rising 4, I can't recommend the game enoughI know I'm in the minority here but i actually enjoyed the game a lot more without the timer. Obviously, there are many others who did not. I felt like I could take my time and explore and see what all the game had to offer. Hopefully, the next game can strike a balance where there will be an option to play the campaign with or without the timer.Pros+Amusing, endearing commentary from Frank+Stupid, fun weapons+Zombie selfies!+Fantastic open-world setting that is filled with detail+The removal of the timer allows you to play at your own pace+Tons of amusing outfits to discover+Lots of weapons to create with tons of variety+The combination of weapons and vehicles are outstanding+Improved investigations and camera mechanics+Killing hordes of zombies in so many different ways never gets old+Weapon upgrade system+Tons of zombies on screen at one timeCons-No campaign co-op-Some occasional bugs and glitches-Gameplay might be on the easy side for some-Very little in terms of new ideas-Frustrating encounters-Where are the psychos?-No benefit to using different weapons once you find your favoriteMy verdict:4/5Minor technical issues aside, the game is a blast. Finer tuned mechanics, streamlined inventory management and a combo vehicle accessible map makes returning to Willamette a worth while experience. Less gimmick, more fun. - I also guarantee at the time of writing this that the majority of severely negative reviews from users are people who haven't actually played the game at all.NOTE: game runs  fine on my workstation rig and my spec is down below and runs in High settings on 1080p-xeon dual E5-2670-Supermicro X9DRD-IF-B Supermicro X9DRD-IF-B Dual LGA2011- Intel C602- DDR3- SATA3- V&2GbE- EATX Server  Motherboard-WD Blue 3TB Desktop Hard Disk Drive - 5400 RPM SATA 6 Gb/s 64MB Cache 3.5 Inch - WD30EZRZ-ADATA Premier SP550 480GB 2.5 Inch SATA III Solid State Drive (ASP550SS3-480GM-C)-Hyper 212 EVO - CPU Cooler with 120mm PWM Fan (AM4 bracket available through Cooler Master USA)-Micron 64GB 8x8GB PC3L 10600R DDR3 ECC REG Server Memory MT36KSF1G72PZ-1G4M1HE-EVGA SuperNOVA 850 G2, 80+ GOLD 850W, Fully Modular, EVGA ECO Mode, 10 Year Warranty, Includes FREE Power On Self Tester Power Supply 220-G2-0850-XR-MSI Computer Video Graphic Cards GeForce GTX 1050 TI GAMING X 4G-Corsair Obsidian Series 750D Airflow Edition, Full Tower ATX Case"

,Recommended,543460,34450375,Posted: 23 August,all,ftstani,"Dead Rising 4 is an open-world zombie-slaying sandbox, and it's awesome. The world is rendered in loving detail. Honestly this may be the most detailed open-world I've played to date, other than RPGs like Fallout 4. Almost every building and store is enterable and fully detailed. Lots of objects are interactable and can be used to bludgeon zombies and hostile survivors. It's just grade-A pure fun♥♥♥♥♥♥and a blast to play. The centerpiece of the setting is the Willamette Parkview Mall, a surburban megamall. Presumably it's the rebuilt mall from Dead Rising 1. It's an amazing and hilarious place to explore, complete with themed sections and employee tunnels. If you've ever just wanted to blow things up and have fun in a shopping mall, this game has that.Having said that, Dead Rising 4 has a couple of problems.First, compared to the earlier games, some gameplay elements are gone. Dead Rising 3 has a more robust hand-to-hand melee system and you can throw weapons. That's absent here. But I don't really see any problems. My biggest complaint is that they took out the weapons locker from Dead Rising 3 so now you have to manually re-collect any weapons from their original locations. If I want the halberd I gotta go all the way back to Medieval Town in the mall.Much more serious is that they took out psychos and the psycho cutscenes. Having just started playing Dead Rising 3 also, I'd say that's a big step backward because that game had some ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious psychos. Dead Rising 4 still has maniacs, but these guys lack all of the satirical humor of the earlier psychos. And no cutscenes of course.These cutbacks notwithstanding, the gameplay component itself is much improved from the earlier games. Combat is more visceral. The blood is more plentiful. There are dynamic blood arcs and splatters. Zombies number in the thousands on-screen, and performance remains great. This game actually has better performance than the PC port of Dead Rising 3 despite the vast improvement in visuals.The second problem is the playable character Frank West. A lot of people have a problem with his voice actor and appearance changing compared to Dead Rising 1 and 2. I never played those games. I don't have a mental image of how the ""real"" Frank West should be like, but I love Dead Rising 4's Frank West. The man is ♥♥♥♥ing badass and hilarious.The game does have a small problem with inconsistent tone. But I never found it as jarring as a lot of other players and reviewers. People make it seem like you're watching Schindler's List punctuated by Jerry Seinfeld segments, and that's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Does this game have a tone problem? Yeah. Like in one instance towards the beginning one character accidentally has an Anthony Weiner phone moment, and that spoiled the seriousness of the scene. But really egregious stuff like that is rare.Overally, try it. It's hella fun."

Frank has well in excess of 20 different outfits to collect too.Gameplay itself is solid, I rarely found myself fighting the controls.  Going for high kill count streaks was a lot of fun, especially in the combo vehicles.Combo Weapons and Vehicles – Nothing quite like tearing into a pack of zombies with a lightsaber! Or mowing them down in the unholy combination of a plow truck and a hearse.Characters and storyline were good.

There were a few times I really laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off.NEGATIVESNew Clothing! – the only downside to collecting the clothes is that Frank “checks himself out” each and every time.  It’s a 5-10 second animation that the player CANNOT interrupt.  By the end I stopped collecting clothes because it had gone from annoying to infuriating.The occasional mesh error – Sometimes you will be driving along on a forklift and suddenly you will go flying out the front as it gets stuck on absolutely nothing at all.  It’s annoying, but it didn’t happen to me often.Many fans of the earlier titles seem to be very upset with the main character.

Just like other Dead Rising games, you can use traffic pylons, guitars, axes, and make your own weapons! The comedy (""I love minigolf!"") and voice acting in this game makes it much more comedic.They also removed the throw weapon mechanic and changed the controls a bit so that you don't need to feel confused in the heat of combat! Pull the right trigger or R2 to use your ranged weapons, press down on the D-Pad to heal yourself, and just press X (Square) and Y (Triangle) to use oyur melee! This is very streamlined.Also, they have made a HUGE improvement when they removed the timer to a ""big event""! This makes this game so much more fun, as you now have full freedom to explore, find all blueprints, experiment with weapons, and generally have FUN!

Thats what you should keep in mind when buying/playing this game. Its a zombie killing game and thats it!There is no real challenge as with the other DR games since you dont have time limit to complete the game or else you fail and no psychopaths who offered real challenge. Personally i like having no time limit as i can explore and spend time killing zombies else than really focusing on ending the game of which the 2 first games were all about and i did love them for that.

Note that in the past six weeks or so I replayed DR, Dr2, DR2 OTR, and DR3, all on Steam. I enjoy them all for different reasons and I recognize that they are all different games. Go figure. I would not see the point in playing four or five iterations of Dead Rising (One).Altho Dead Rising was a fantastic game, there was also a lot of blatant sexism and some weird necrophilia stuff that was just cringeworthy. I was glad to see that decrease as the series continued. I mean... ugh.DR4 graphics and gameplay are working great for me. Fairly new high end gaming machine I got runs if great. So far the only thing that really seems rushed to me is the vendors standing around the safe houses. It just seems unfinished. I read that some people did not like the locker/closet system in DR3 so maybe the devs were not sure how they wanted to handle all this. Personally, I really liked that system in DR3. I loved being able to go to a safe house and be alone to regroup and have my wardrobe and weapons all available in one place. Making a combo one time and then having it available to use forever after works for me. It's a bit odd in DR4 that there are so many weapons just laying around everywhere. Either option is a little unbalanced, I guess.You can't please everybody. I am happy with the game and plan to play a lot more. The game is what it is, not what people think it should be. Nothing can measure up to everybody's expectations. All the vitriol is, of course, unwarranted. Too many expectations lead to disappointment.Capcom deserves a lot of credit in my book for engaging with the community on this. Thank you! Have a fabulous, magical day!"

,Recommended,543460,33636716,Posted: 18 July,all,Shh'Paghetti,"I completely understand why people don't like this game.No time limit,no psychopaths(instead we got maniacs who are easy to kill and they don't have their own cutscenes),probably Frank became from reasonable and cheesy middle age guy to a stubborn old man(with one liners),you can't throw objects anymore,etc...you get the point they removed a lot of things that the previous games in the series had.But still as a Dead Rising fan I would like to say that Dead Rising 4 is NOT A BAD GAME AND DOESN'T DESERVE ALL THE ACTUAL HATE THAT IT GOT.I mean...come on guys it's like Dmc:Devil May Cry all over again don't hate the game just cause the developers wanted to appeal more to the much younger generation that were born in the 2000s.What about the gameplay?:Pros:-Great PC port(didn't had a crash or a bug at all in my play session);-You level up fast;-Elements taken from Dead Rising 3(open world outside of Willamette,vehicle crafting,on foot weapon crafting,sprint,etc.);-More options for the digital camera;-Amazing final boss fight;-A new tipe of zombie;-Much more effective weapons and easy to find and craft;-The Exo suit;-The healing items have their own invetory;Cons:-Short campaign(8-9 hours average);-Lack of story co-op(instead we get a poor co-op story that has nothing to do with the main campaign);-No psychopaths instead we get maniacs with no cutscenes;-Can't throw away weapons anymore;-Frank one liners;-Obligatory investigation minigames;-Not so many blueprints;-The Christmas theme(I mean come on I bought this game on summer sale);-Disappointing ending;I gave it an average 7/10:''No more mister nice Frank''(Please keep in mind that this review it's my own opinon maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm right about the game but please don't hate on me that much.)"
76561198071878410,Recommended,543460,34378389,Posted: 20 August,all,Surian Bedivere,"I have to say, i dont understand these negative comments. Well, not entirely that is.First up: Yes, you can no longer throw melee weapons and items. I miss it too guys, but honestly it's not really that bad of a thing. Instead it switches the game to having a melee, thrown/explosive and ranged weapon equipped at the same time, and you can carry whatever you like around and switch it in/out as the active weapons. Hit X and swing a weapon, turn and aim to shoot one in the face, hit X again to swing and run away and drop a grenade or whatever you currently had equiped in the thrown slot. It makes it very action oriented. The old system was a little lacking sometimes due to having to switch, so it's an improvement all the same despite you missing out on some humor that throwing a pie in someone's face gave instead of eating it.Second: Yes, the time limit is gone. Some like it, some dont. I actually like it. They put a LOT of work in details, and this lets you explore all you want and see every sight, gimmick and secret if you can put in the time to find it. And there are hundreds of them. Yes, it's not really the old Dead Rising feel of be at X-location at Y-time for a specific event to trigger, and having to replay the game a hundred times over to discover them all. But it was also stressful. Many of you are upset it's gone, but you guys probably dont remember how anoying it was at times when you were trying to get somewhere, stopped to have a look at something you never saw before, and ran out of time or missed an event. Not to mention the required events that you werent allowed to miss and had to be at, or your game was over. This is a lot better, and they still have semi-random events and triggered events by certain actions.That all said and done. The game is massive, beautiful, interesting and there's a ton of detail poured into it. Some of the weapons are a little over the top, but that's honestly the only thing i dont fully endorse. They are fun though. There is so much to do and see. There is something relaxing about taking on the zombie apocalypse with swords, guns and what not.And lets not forget, if you should ever feel done with the regular game, there actually is proper MULTIPLAYER now. Really fun concept, and you can level seperately from your main game for every of the characters you choose. It's kind of a competitive co-op game. It's best if you all survive, but there is a point count at the end, you can choose not to let everyone reach the safe room and abandon people if you feel you can make it by yourself. It also brings back timers since if you're not at the safe room by 0:00 on the countdown you dont survive the night. It's really rough for as far as i've tried it, you really need to work together.I've played all Dead Rising games since the first one. And while #1 was always my favorite and i played the disk to dust, this one has sadly taken the cake. But by only a very small margin. It's a really fun game for people who can look beyond the two ""minor"" changes from the previous games."

I like to take my time and enjoy open world games, not force to run by places I'd like to check out but don't have enough time to investigate. I like that they removed this feature. Always killed DR games for me.Games fun. Lost of funny moments. Just a fun, turn your brain off hack and slash. Only improvements I would say would be a better melee combat system. It's lacking focused melee, is just saying and hope your pointing in the right direction. Would like to see a more Shadow of Mordor or Arkham like fight system. With tons of slow mo finishers with environment linking. That would be amazing. This game needs more ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥that just happened"" moments."
,Recommended,543460,34626143,Posted: 30 August,all,niX,"The best way to sum up this game is that if you didn't like Dead Rising 3, you won't like this game.If you did enjoy Dead Rising 3, then you'll probably find some enjoyment in Dead Rising 4. It features a similar ""real life"" art style to Dead Rising 3 (as opposed to a more cartoon style of Dead Rising 1/2), it shares a lot of game mechanics (such as making combo weapons on the fly). But it also shares some of the more lackluster features that Dead Rising 3 couldn't compete with the earlier Dead Rising games on.ProsThe time limit has been taken out. At first I thought, ""how could they do this? That's one of the flagship features of the Dead Rising series!"" But then I realized this was a necessity. This game's map is HUGE. It's map is even bigger than the city of Los Perdidos in Dead Rising 3. Which is pretty shocking, because at the time, you could put the maps of both DR1 and DR2 inside of DR3's and still have room. The lack of a time limit allows you to explore every nook and cranny at your own speed. I think it would be impossible to do everything on one playthrough if they had kept the time limit in.Lots and lots and lots of collectibles! Some may dislike this, but I personally really like collectibles. These collectibles give you a great chance to level up and to really take the time to explore all of the different areas. They're optional too.. so it's not like you HAVE to collect anything, but it adds more to the gameplay for me.Many great combo weapons (some new, and some old), all new combo vehicles and a ton of outfits for Frank to wear. Frank is able to use his camera like he could in previous games, and you will once again be rewarded PP for different kinds of photos. It's a nice call back to the good ol' days of Dead Rising 1.The change in Frank's voice acting wasn't that noticeable. They found a good replacement for T.J. Rotolo. At first I thought this was going to be so jarring that I'd have to play with the sound off or something, but it's fine. Phew. Frank West is back again, baby!A skill tree. Similar to the skill tree system in Dead Rising 3, Dead Rising 4 features a massive skill tree for Frank to spend skill points in. It's been signifigantly expanded and lets you pick advantages that you may want in your game. This makes the game feel more rewarding, but also makes it easier. To some, this may seem like a downside (but you can always change your difficulty).They've raised the level cap from 50 to 100. This is great because I never feel like my experience is just going to waste after I've hit the cap of 50. You level pretty fast in this game up until about level 70 and it gets a bit more time consuming after that. I've beat the game twice and gotten all of the collectibles, and I'm still only at about level 85.ConsThe story is pretty meh. It's alright, but I'd say it's the weakest story of all the Dead Rising games thus far. My main problem is just that I don't care much for any of the characters besides Frank. I had a real issue with Vick in paticular (the side protaganist, kind of) and her character development. The final boss fight was tedious (although creative). If you're going to play this game, keep in mind that you'll find the most enjoyment out of the sand box aspect of it, and probably not the story.Many of the game's achievements and in game challenges depend on multiplayer. Keep in mind that you never NEED to play multiplayer if you don't want to, but you will have to for 100%. This is a bit of a mixed bag for me. I feel like I have to play multiplayer at least to get the full experience, but I don't really care for multiplayer. Plus, nobody I know has the game.. so I feel like I'm missing out on a part of the game.DLC feature very little content and are expensive. Very overpriced. I've also noticed that they seem to gouge PC customers. I was able to get both Mini Golf and Frank Rising for much cheaper on the Xbox One. I haven't bought it on the PC because I feel like I'm getting ripped off paying full price.The lack of psychopath battles is a real shame. At least Dead Rising 3 had the decency to TRY and include them (although they will never be as good as the DR1/DR2 days). This game doesn't even try. You get to fight ""maniacs,"" but there's really no point. You don't get any cool theme music, they pose no challenge, and they aren't really even that creative or fun.They got real lazy with plopping in their random survivors. You need to rescue survivors in order to level up each Emergency Shelter. With 4 shelters in total (needing 15 survivors each), that's 60 survivors at the very least (and they will still appear even if a shelter is leveled). So I get that maybe programming in unique characters wasn't a priority over everything else. But Dead Rising 2 was able to make 50 UNIQUE survivors all with their own missions attached. I'm use to this ""random character with the same model as other survivors"" formula from playing DR3, but it's still incredibly lazy. They've gotten so lazy that I've seen two characters WITH THE SAME NAME but with different colored shirts. REALLY?75 bucks for this (DLC NOT included) is pretty steep. Although I enjoy this game and have gotten a ton of gameplay out of it, they're asking a lot. I bought mine last Christmas sale for about 40 bucks, and I've definitely gotten my money's worth."
,Recommended,543460,30535089,Posted: 15 March,all,Lapidavitque [MOTH],"There's a lot of complaints about this game I'm not sure why, minor bug issues. it's a safe bet that no one played this series for the story, we all played it to kill zombies while wearing a woman's dress and this game delivers, an interesting new feature is the ""investigation"" which is reminiscent of the same concept in the Batman Arkham franchise but on a smaller scale. basically if you're looking for a game with a great story I highly recommend the Batman Arkham franchise or Witcher or the recent Tomb Raider games or even go mod crazy with Elder Scrolls and fallout, but if you're looking to just kill some zombies and look damn fine while doing it then this is the game for you, just wouldn't recommend full price."

I would have liked it more had this game been in a setting similar to dead rising 3. I am tired of malls and closed in areas. I haven't played a great deal, so i assume that this game might actually get outside. I hope.I have to admit that i don't feel the desire to follow the story at the moment.

I felt that Dead Rising 3 did a great job of giving you enough time to mess around, but also having something there to push you along. This game feels more like your average sandbox game, but that isn't a bad thing really. It's still very enjoyable to smash zombies in creative ways and the humor is enjoyable. Traveling between the mall and town make for a nice variety of scenery. This is a very nice looking game at times, but I did notice some minor flickering. Nothing close to as bad as the DR3 shadows though. Lastly, I think that the game is a solid port and is one of the rare games that doesn't feel laggy at a locked 30fps. I think that people who want a laid back game to mess around in can't go wrong here. If you are a Dead Rising purist then maybe wait a while before you complete that collection."

Much shorter with less content than any other DR game before it. The psycho encounters have been hugely watered down and there are no rescue missions any more. The timer has been taken away but hasn't been replaced with any other meaningful mechanic. The storyline is interesting enough but feels kind of rushed especially since there's not much else to do in between story missions except look for a few collectables. The new Frank West is likeable enough but the other characters are fairly bland and forgettable.I was hoping for rescue missions, side quests, secret areas, etc - the game has none of that. It shuttles you through the linear story and doesn't really give you anything meaningful in between the 7 short chapters. The lack of dynamic missions is a glaring loss and if you're a fan of the previous DR games you'll really notice its absence. In its place are ""encounters"" which are basically just running into randomized people out in the world and clearing the zombies away from them.The map is big enough, beautifully designed, and fun to traverse, but quite a bit smaller than DR3. It screams out for more story and mission content so the player can spend more time in it doing something other than looking for collectables. I expected a bit of backtracking for more missions in the same areas but really there isn't any and the game apparently expects you to just explore for the sake of it. The world isn't really utilized to its full potential. There are a lot of craftable weapons but a large proportion of them are just useless christmas themed novelties that you won't use more than once. There's a ton of craftable vehicles but you won't get a chance to use most of them.I had fun with this game but I was disappointed that they cut so much from what would have made a fantastic DR game. As it stands, the game is passable but not great. It's worth your time if you like zombie games, but maybe after buying it on sale."

Just when you think you have seen it all, more comes pooring in. Just about every single object around you is a weapon, and you can combine those objects to create bigger and badder weapons. Or go bare knuckles, which is one of my favorite approaches. Killing zombies has never been so much fun. I killed over 10,000 zombies my first 5hrs of gameplay, they literally keep a list in numbers at the bottom left corner of your screen showing the exact amount of zombies you have killed. Which i beleive is a very encouraging way to just kill more. There are hordes of zombies, not just one or a few, but hordes of zombies just begging to be blown to smitherines. And not only can u just kill zombies, you can take pictures and selfies as well. Which isn't the greatest feature in the game, but isn't entirely bad as i do find myself using it at times of ""man i gotta get a shot of this"".Though.The story and characters could have used a bit of work, as well as the character customization options as they are very limited and at times appear to be dull, and creates a huge feeling of emptyness. As if something is missing. Which clearly with a game like this, with as far as it has been pushed, you would expect that the developers would not have left out on a few major important features of the user/player experience by leaving out something like a decent pair of sneakers to wear while you kill zombies, not everyone enjoys wearing boots and sketcher like sneakers. Not really the prefered style these days anyway, especially not in 2022, as is where the game setting takes place. Which if your going to throw the game a few years ahead in time and not create even the slightest difference in time, then what is the point?Anyway my intent is not to throw this game under a rock and leave it there. I love the game, but it misses a few things that keep the player in, you have to feed the needs games like this create. Which i am sure a few updates could change over time and fix these issues. But keep in miund this is my first impression. And it is definately worth the money. But i guarentee i am not the only person that feels this way.Anyway, comments welcome.Agree or Disagree?"

I love their story lines and sub missions in DR1 to 3, also I really enjoyed using varied weapons and funny clothes to kill zombies.  But after finished the whole game and I quite dispointed on this time they don't have any sub mission to play with makes the playing time become shorter than previous and getting little bored. Also one of the special point on DR is the psychopaths boss, I thought this time could also having fun on them but they just cancelled it on DR4, thats really sad. Anyway, I still love this game because I love Frank West since DR1 very much and this time he becomes more humor all the time LOL  Hope they will bring back the psychopath and sub mission next time. =D Don't let the gamers become more and more frustrated in the future."
76561198047240777,Recommended,543460,30630357,Posted: 19 March,all,Nameless Avatar,"I liked most of the changes made to the series. One of the best changes was seperating the inventory slots for thrown, melee, and shooting weapons, and having seperate buttons for each type. The end result of this change was I ended up using a wider variety of weapons than I did in DR 1-3, simply because there is more room, and you don't need to ignore an entire class of situational weapons. The other major change was the removal of the time limits. Glad they got rid of it, as the mechanic had worn out its welcome after 3 games.The replacement of the psychopaths with maniacs is the one change I didn't like. They really didn't want to create cutscenes for these battles, so they just renamed the encounter type. Unfortunantley without the cutscenes these encounters aren't as memorable as some of the ones from the previous games. They should bring back psychopaths in the next game. Other than that, this is a great game. Get it."

I took a point off for the fact that it is lacking a lot of polish in many ways, some enemies appear in walls, some animations appear to be missing, and even though the Candy Cane Crossbow is a combo weapon, I can't seem to craft it, which is odd.With a little bit of polish it could easily be a 4 out of 5.Why only a 4? Due to having less attention to detail, a more confusing UI, and overall a less talented development team in general compared to previous games in the series I'll have to take a point off. If the first four Dead Rising games didn't exist I would say this is one of the greatest action games of all time.There's some minor freezing issues if you play in Windowed Mode (which the game defaults too), but they are non-existant in fullscreenIf you're a die-hard fan of the series, it's worth checking out if it's on sale.If you're a casual admirer of the series, eh, skip it, there's nothing worth writing home about if you've played previous titles. If you've played Dead Rising 1, 2, or 2:OTR you've had a superior experience.If you're just getting into Dead Risng for the first time, it's not a bad starting point, but Dead Rising 2:Off The Record might be a worthier purchase as it's where the series seems to peak in quality.Overall, I liked it more than I liked 3, but that doesn't say much given how mediocre 3 was."

You can ignore all the negative reviews, they are just earlier game fanboys, unhappy with change and new content.

You know one guy was killed cause people broke down the doors and trampled him, one example as to why humans are mindless heartless selfish zombies...

To be honest Deadrising 4 has lived up to my expections and then some. I know this game came out on Xbox first before pc but, I avoided all reviews, gameplays, and pictures till it came out today on pc. I must say I've been having a blast, literally, lighting up zombies with the more bizare and totally amazing weapon combos, and that's where Deadrising stands strong. It's whacked out combo weapons is what keep me playing. It stands out above other zombie titles. Plus the main character is Frank West, who in my opinion is a fiting role for such an odd world. The other characters from Deadrising 2&3 tried to be serious like in an action but, it was mixed in with deadrising's unrealistic world. Map is huge looting with tons of items to your use. This game is amazing and has become one of my favorite zombie games to date. Runs smoothy on my bootleg gaming laptop which I thought it wouldn't. My only downside to Deadrising 4 is the fact Co-op isn't like the other Deadrisings. It's ok but, I still wished Capcom would have stayed with it. Also you'll run into some bugs with the zombies but, it won't be enough to dumb down the expericence. If you loved the deadrising series you'll want to have this game as well. I can't give it a full 10/10 but I can give it a 9.5/10. Hope this review helps."

,Not Recommended,543460,30537808,Posted: 16 March,all,Holy,"TL:DR 2 --- Dont buy this game. The review below was my first impression and ofc i was hyped.Really hoped that anything, at all, some sort of big event would change this game but as many pointet out, the game pretty much loses its power after the first two hours. Its an endless ""drive here, kill that, do this, go back""All the charming bosses? GoneAll the fun in Co-op? GoneAny reason to buy the DLC or Seasonpass? NoneThey could have made so much more with this. But the fact that you can freely go around grab anything and throw it was actually one of the reasons why i liked the series. It was just a good timewaster. but they took even that.Heal items? Stored all as the same type of generic heal item. Doesnt matter if it is a medkit or a can, they heal based on your bought skills in the skilltree.Also a major bummer:There are good combo weapons, and bad ones. and i m not talking some have minor bonuses, others dont. We talk essential to keep on playing, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Most ranged weapons kill 50 zombies with a single shot. Most close combat weapons can not even get to kill 1 per swing.But now to the cherry on the sh*t mountain.The DLC is awful. im talking bullsh*t into your nose and lungs.The idea behind ""Frank Rises"" is actually quite the cool one. Playing the Zombie and all. But right after the Tutorial you are confronted with the biggest issue. Time.The DLC gives you i believe a hour to complete. If you fail, you need to restart. If you want to complete it, you really have only 1 choice: going for the easy difficulty.If you start anything higher then that, you can expect to not make it. Enemies 3 hit you. ""Eating"" 4-5 fully restores you. How to be able to eat them? get a combo chain. after i wasted what felt around 2 hours on ""hell on earth"" i just couldnt do it anymore. i was out of time after around 20% of the story, and couldnt do♥♥♥♥♥♥to anything, because to unlock your powers, you need to do trails, which are impossible, because you dont have any powers. I was glad when it was over.Also ♥♥♥♥♥♥ challenges all over the game, where you are supposed to kill 100 survivors with hockey sticks and those f*ckers only drop like twice per load game. Guess how many hits it takes to break them.Just for the luls my first review of this piece of garbageActual (first impression) Review:TL:DR --- Buy this game if you really like a mindless button smasher. Else wait for a discount. ---Just to start this review, i dont understand why everybody is complaining about crashes.I played this game now for the second day straight and i didnt even had minor lags once.Also repetitivity, didnt know that the other DR games were any different. Run to location, fulfil task, create weapons on the way to fulfil task easier. It has been like that for atleast since DR2. The only mayor difference with this one is, that you dont have a time limit and that you are not getting a mission to rescue somebody, but you happen to find them randomly thoughout the place.You can choose between 3 difficulties, where easy actually is just pressing the LMB because the enemy are hardly a threat, normal, and hard in which you actually need to watch your positioning since enemies are taking you out without much of a problem. Also weapons and guns have 50% reduced durabilityThe combo weapon system has been also simplified. For most combos, you dont need 2 exact items, but most of the time just for example: specific item + an electronic item. i found this to be annoying on easy, but really reliefing on hard, since you would just get mowed down before you can create a ""good"" weapon.Game works with a skill tree system, like in DR3 but a little more complex. Max level open end so you can max out all skills.The story itself seems to be like in any other DR game. Cant say i like the new Frank West though, he either aged really bad from a personal side, or thats just what a zombie outbreak do to your mentally state.Cant say much to Co-op, but as much as i have heard, its bad, because its a seperate story. Need to look into that.All in allI AMvery satisfied with this game, since its easy fun. If you expected this game to be DR1, you will be dissapointed. but its not like it has been out for around 4 months, so you could easily look into a playthrough, to decide if you are going to like it or not."
