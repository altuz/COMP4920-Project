I can play this game at decent fps without any problem. Just make sure that this game is set to use your GPU instead of your integrated graphic."

,Recommended,543870,34834039,Posted: 9 September,all,jpsf91,"Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, like the other Storm titles, is a good anime fighting game but you need to be a fan of the Naruto anime. It's not very competitive, but has decent mechanics that get the job done. Compared to the later titles, Storm 2 may fall a bit short in the gameplay and roster, but the story mode has the same quality standards, telling the events of the first half of Naruto Shippuden. Personally, i also think that the music is better in this title. There's an online mode, but don't expect to find much activity there. I played it mainly for the story mode, and enjoyed it. The bosses and QTE's were nice, and the post-game side quests not too bad. And the game on 60 FPS is another beast. The weakest points are the english voices, the corridor style world map, and maybe the lack of some features that were present in the original Naruto Storm. It's a good game if you're a Naruto fan, and on PC i didn't found any major issues."

Frame rate goes all over the place at random times, and with the same problem as with Storm 1 and 3, you can only do either SMAA or FXAA and not both for some reason (MSAA is fine just like with the other games). This is probably the best Storm game optimization wise."

,Recommended,543870,34519661,Posted: 26 August,all,✪TheScepter☣,The graphics are on the level of storm 4 now and the game is capped at 60 fps. ALSO BIG glitch if you tab out during the story mode your game will freeze

76561198159163746,Recommended,543870,35240894,Posted: 27 September,all,Proud◊Saiyan,"It's an awesome Naruto game but this is the worst compared to the others, here is why:-The hidden leaf village is 10 times shorter than the one from storm 1-You can't load a ninjutsu to make it longer like in storm 1 but in exchange you have enhanced ninjutsu for some characters-The jutsu clash is no longer here, neither in the newest ones-They made the UJ from 30 seconds to 5-15 seconds without minigames in it-You can't walk on walls / kick an opponent when he or she is on the ground / kick an opponent in the face etc.-You can't select the ninjutsu for your character or support like in storm 1 , but atleast in storm 4 they re-add it back-The game have a lot of loading screens ,atleast these version for PC/PS4/XONE load fasterAnd you can't stop your chakra dash / spam chakra dash and a lot of mini features that make the game more competitiveWell the game have a lot of cons but that doesn't mean it's a bad game, atleast Storm 2 have the most accurate story mode and it is still funny to play even today.       I'll rate this somewhere to 7.0-7.5   Still a good game"

,Recommended,543870,35326537,Posted: 30 September,all,froppy,"The best storm game (IN MY OPINION) covering the best arcs in shippuden (IN MY OPINION). Anyways, impressive cell shading and graphics. Some moments straight up made my jaw drop. Fun button masher game made fore fans of the anime. This game could use some more cutscenes and not just dialogue scenes. Watch the anime before playing.9/10"

Unlike the first game, this one has actual cut scnes and epic boss fights that follows the anime.  Some things are changed for story telling purposes but overall it is still a great game.THOSE HAVING GRAPHICS PROBLEMS READ HERE!!!!!Make sure the game is running off of the correct graphics card.  I don't know the exact way to do it on AMD but on Nvidia it goes like this:1) Right click on desktop and open Nvidia Control Panel2)Click manage 3D programs3)Search for program and choose the game4) Where it says auto select gpu, change that to use the Nvidia gpu5) Click apply6) Enjoy!Sorry my steps aren't exact but I can't remember exactly what each button says but that's the gist of it"
