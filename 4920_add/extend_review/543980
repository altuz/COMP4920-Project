,Recommended,543980,26284846,"Posted: 29 October, 2016",all,Gradation,"This review is unfinished. Just like the game.But in fairness, readers of this review and others will have forewarning. The game is Zombie Exodus 2 Part 1. If you liked the last one, you'll most likely like this one. If you didn't like the last one, this one is better. It's your choice now whether you have to deal with family members, pets, handicaps, and addictions. Better yet, your family member now consists of a terrified eight year nephew you can leave with strangers, instead of a scantily clad, ghoul-possessed sister. It's nice not to have the cure in your hand, and have to play exorcist.It almost feels like you're making the decisions. There's so many choices, that I honestly went back, and reselected the traits in a manner to experience it, rather than game it. The joy of a real choose your own adventure, where you actually are the reader in the story is there. You have true diverging starts. Your career choice affects the start of the opening scene. The location affects the story proper.I almost believed. Except for programming. Hacking  is apparently Swordfish, by the power of 812th episode of the Grassy Knoll on the History Channel, with the literacy of the /b/ boards. Fortunately, the other professions (at least doctor and engineer) were more believable. You may be on a bad episode of ER, but you aren't getting coffee and bragging about your super skillz.Suspension of disbelief is especially important to survival stories. In many ways, Safe Haven surpasses its predecessor. The apocalypse doesn't reduce the city to zombies in two seconds. People are relatively smart. They don't insist on fortifying churches built out of asbestos and black mold. They don't worship zombies. They survive without your constant nannying and intervention.Unfortunately, depending on and in spite of your choices, there isn't much to do. Of course, you can research for the cure. You can communicates with your peers - military hardmen, hacker blofeld, your neighbors. You wire camera modules in your house. (Does zombie drool make sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev run faster?) Ultimately everything in this story of any overreaching consequence is without resolution.Your fortress of Damocles gets caught on fire.In fact, when it really comes down to it, this is a daring tale of YOU (Dr. Neville?), your dog Max, and your nephew Frodo drawing bath tub water (possibly bath tub gin) and boarding up your house till you got to save the noble princess from the elementary school of doom.To be continu-Maybe. But the real question is, should you play it? If you like this type of game, yes. Even incomplete, Safe Haven is longer, more immersive and better written than many other instances of the same genre. And in distinct contrast to it's linear predecessor, Safe Haven is an incredible, if inconsistent, exercise into the power of RPG choice."

But overall this game is lacking.1. Suprisingly the game is quite linear - When you play different playthroughs you can see that story does not change in any significant aspect. But that is not fault of the game, all choice of the games have this problem, I just expected something more from story with such many options.2. Scavenging is pointless - I can see that in next part of the story, things that you have scavenged may come in handy. But if you look at this game as standalone (which it is for now) you don't need more resources than you have in the begining in your house.3. It's not that long - I get that, you can play it many times with different origin stories. But I would much prefer if there would be less origin stories, so the game would be hour longer.4. DLC and bonus - Just saying 1 euro is a good price for the dlc for text game. But knowing how easy you can cheat in that types of games (just by altering few values in notepad) it seems unnecessary. DLC which gives you sandbox options would be much better option. And another thing, bonus from first game. I can see that many people couldn't load their saves from the first game, because for steam versions this option was unavailable. So if the devs could slightly change steam versions of this game, would be cool.Overall: For standalone game It's not that good, considering that you have to wait presumably another year for next part of the story. But I can see that when next parts of the story will come out, It could be the best text game on steam."

Also, using the bonus points seems to lock you in as a male character, which is irritating.Pros:+ stellar writing and storytelling+ a patch for major bugs is coming soon+ different prologues for different careers adds to replayability+ your efforts making noticeable differences+ the disadvantage choices at character creation add to the plot, not just the difficulty level+ character creation allows for entertaining combinations of characteristics (my favourite playthroughs so far have been a gay bank robber with a heart of gold, and a chain-smoking teenager caring for her newly-orphaned nephew)Overall, the pros definitely outweighed the cons for me, especially knowing a bug patch is on the way. I think this game is more than worth the money."

In its' current state, I wouldn't recommend if you're looking for a complete game as this is more ""early access"" but with the amount of content found in a demo.

76561198103497349,Recommended,543980,33823711,Posted: 26 July,all,the_walking_kyle,"I loved Zombie Exodus, but found Safe Haven too slow. Basically you're trying to survive in the first few days of the apocalypse. Each day you have to decide what you want to do and where you want to go. Each decision takes time out of the day. My first playthrough was 8 hours. How about some pros and cons:Pros:-So many stats, even more at the end of the game ;)-Excellent character creation. Attribute and Skills system. I really liked the skills system, there's alot to choose from.-Lots of characters.-Revenge options! Sweet revenge, drool......-I did enjoy my death scene, I'd give myself some kind of acting award.Cons:-No saves. I made a foolish decision and died, but I wanted to continue playing as that character. Had to pick all my stats again, then play through what I found a very slow game just to get to that same point.-Don't really get to know the characters, I found them pretty generic.-Crafting system. I didn't think it was necessary. More time could have been spent on developing characters.Final Verdict:If your going to buy this game make a really interesting character. Like a banker robber or something. The story is just too slow and the other characters too generic. If you don't mind a slow story the game is worth the price, and has alot of replay value."

Up until the end the very end of the game it is great and almost feels like a standard visual survival game where you're looking for items to survive (food, weapons, etc.).  The end of story is the problem though and it stops almost immediately in a rush and is almost the opposite of the rest of the game but even with that it is still worth the price."

If you die, that's it; game over, no back to the last save point or anything, it's back to the beginning for you.Very dissapointing, especially for a game this long. I really don't know why they didn't include backing up/restore points, this isn't a roguelike after all."

Zombie Exodus: Safe Haven ends very close to the ending of the demo.That being said, it was worth reading the end to that scenario. I must admit the last demo I played was not the last revealed one, so I can't say anything based on those changes, but from what I did play, it was interesting to see the differences in drafts. I was able to prevent different events from happening, and while I'm not sure if this was just due to me playing awfully beforehand, I'm going to write it up as an improvement done by Dattilo.For those who did not play the demo, Zombie Exodus: Safe Haven is good. It's a Choice of Games/Hosted Games story, meaning this isn't really a, ""game."" It's a novel where you are able to make choices for the main character. No visuals, no sound. For someone who needs high visual or auditory stimulation to enjoy something, this definitely is not for you.It's worth mentioning that this game is short compared to its predecessor, Zombie Exodus, but it is worth mentioning that this is only part one of the story.The story is creative and the different options that range from occupation, living factors, etc. are fun to test out for different results.I'd highly recommend this, as well as Zombie Exodus, as they are fine editions to the Choice of Games/Hosted Games selection. Dattilo has done a fine job in writing these and I am happy to support his work.tl;drShort but great read."

And then I bought this one.You see first I downloaded the demo, it was ok, short, naturally as you dont wantt o give the entire thing away but enough to make me sure that this like the others was well written and structured to be worth buying.  However after playing to it's conclusion all  I can say is that I feel conned.Previous interactive games by this creator have been full stories, a beginning, middle, and end of sorts, and they've been great, sure some may be split across separate volumes but overall they have been worth the money because they have had been long-enought o keep you satisfired.This however is a travesty, you get PART of the entire story, a chunk of it that is very short, and leaves you in the position of having buy the next part in the story if you want to continue. It feel like the remaining parts were locked behind a paywall, and nominal fee or not, the developers are still holding the remaining parts of the story to ransom, with an attitude of pay up otherwise you don't get to continue the game through to it's conclusion like you've been able to in numerous other intactive story games this publisher has released in the past.In it's current state and given that you pretty much only get a small fragment of the game for the price, and it most definateyly isn't worth it, I WOULD NOT recommend this game."

The game does have some bugs and is a what I can best describe as a slow start.-Cons--Skill system locks you into just your prime and secondary skills when you try to start game with extra starting skills.(as lots of others have touched on. I have talked to to the email support and good news there is a patch. Bad news its just not updated on steam yet. Mary who I talked to did say it should be fixed soon tho so here's hoping.-The game is linear. While you can choice between several different characters that only effects intro.(I do think in later parts it will play a huge part but as far as the this game goes bit of a let down.) Its not the worst thing ever but does get repetitive after several play throughs. This is the starting point though and the game has to start somewhere so in the end it is understandable.-Pros--Everything elseI say that but I'm not really kidding-the story and the writing is great. You can feel that the plot is leading you to something epic and the journey is just getting started.-the NPC are written wonderfully and feel real. The interactions feel life like and the choice they make can shock you as well as play right into what you expect from them. I love the diversity so far.-Romance in the the apocalypse? Please and thank you. It might seem odd to think about dating while zombies are trying to eat you but when the world is ending you find comfort where you can. I've always  loved loved loved this aspect in games and ZESH it looks like is setting up to be might impressive in the area. I can see spending way to many hours of my life playing with this mechanic and loving every one of them. So many choices and I will find them all.-skill system is flexible. When they get it working you will be able to be any type of person you wont really. Be a soldier with great weapon training or a hacker thats terrified and allergic to everything.-Extra bonuses for beating Zombie Exodus was a nice touch as well. You can buy another 25 extra starting skill points for .99 which while I usually hate dlc I'm dealing with this one.Overall its a great game with a lot more to come. I'm looking forward to the next and the next and the all the parts of the game. This game is very much worth a look as well as his other Zombie Exodus one. If you've never tried one before give this one a try.-Personal Note-I would love to see a God mode at the end of the game or something. After completing the game say 5, 10 or even 20 times. You can start the game over with the Char's stat's you finished the game with. New game plus but with hopefully near maxed stats. Then you can play through and just see what would happen with the higher stats. Not something you'd have to use if you want to play normally but a gift for completing the game so many times. Would be nice and spice the game back up after putting in what at that point would have to be 100's of hrs."
