The place was oozing tranquility. Such beauty.My home is filled with things full of memories, every tiny nail telling a story in wonderfully crafted rhymes. I couldn't help myself but taking it all in, listening to the wonderful melodies this world is filled with.Now my cows got abducted by a golden ship in the sky. I need to have them back!Here I am taking a break. This is too beautiful to bolt it down all at once. I will continue my review when I've finished the game.EDIT: A few days later I've finished the game. It made me cry. I've never cried before in a videogame."

Just finished it in about three hours.What worked well: the hand painted art and rhyming dialogue (and even item descriptions!) give the game a unique flavor on top of the 90s point-and-click formula. There's also a surprising amount of mini-cutscenes, especially toward the conclusion of the game, giving it a satisfying feel.What could've been better: some of the puzzles felt a bit contrived. (The usual complaint about the genre.) Maybe the Quest for Glory approach of including three alternate solutions for each puzzle would've worked here, though I guess it would've been harder to develop.To the author: congratulations! Making this as a one-person shop must've been a heroic task."

Beautiful hand-drawn backgrounds and faces consisting of only a few pixels that still managed to convey emotions. Reminded me a lot of the King's Quest games.It must have been a challenge to write the whole game in verse, and some of the rhymes are a little forced, but +1 for commitment. It really adds a flair of uniqueness to the game.The game is pretty compact and linear for the first half, then opens up a bit in the second half, but still has pretty simple puzzles. There was one part of the game where I was stumped on what to do next, but it turns out I just wasn't clicking where I was supposed to.Beautiful soundtrack. Loved the story. Ending was emotional. It was only a few hours of gameplay, but that was what I was expecting.This game was clearly made with lots of TLC. It's well-polished and I recommend it to any fan of retro indie games."

76561198066677069,Recommended,544970,29185774,Posted: 11 January,all,The Bubble who Changed the World,"It's rare that you come across a game, let alone any form of story that can so quickly and easily immerse you in a story, let alone make itself believable to the point where you feel like all realism has departed from the world, and you find yourself whisked away into the world of the tale. The immeasurable success of Milkmaid of the Milkyway, therefore, lies in the pure orchestration of each of its elements composing a singular, beautiful whole which draws you in from the moment you begin your journey unto its wonderful, emotional conclusion. From the moment I started playing this game until its finish, never once was I not entranced by the sheer beauty of its small, yet beautifully crafted world, or the light, soothing symphonies of its background tracks.Everything out of MotM oozes a charm and an aura of peace. Even playing it fullscreen, the simple style of its pixellated form does nothing to draw you out from the realism of the world; instead, you become engrossed by the soft fluidity of its motions, and the surprising depth it affords its small, yet dynamic cast of characters.The dialogue in the game is no different, and it is clear from every minor interaction, every misstep and recourse inherent in point-and-click adventures you make, that a lot of thought and care went into designing each and every element and interaction in this game. Having not known upon entering it that the entire script was written in rhyme, I found it a hearty surprise, and could not stop smiling to myself at what was at first a stripped down yet serene locution of the world of MotM; later on, I found myself even laughing out loud at certain pocketed moments where the game displayed its more raunchy side.All in all, if you're someone looking for a break from the fast-paced, adrenaline-filled and flashiness that populates so much of video games today, and instead are looking for a simple yet profound, story rich game which will leave you with a lingering sense of tingling happiness to take with you into the night, this is definitely the game for you. A title which feels more like a true experience than simply just a game, Milkmaid of the Milkway is a triumph of one man game development, and the perfect game to kick off 2017 with."

It expands on Ruth's character as a whole. Speaking of Ruth, she is an amazing main character. This game has shown that is possible to write a female main character correctly. She is spunky, caring, and fits the story perfectly. This game is short and simple (only took me 3 hours). It's worth the $8 for the rich and interesting story. The art of the game also is remarkable and compliments the overall style of the game.I would highly recommend this game for any fans of point and click adventure games, poetry, or anyone who just wants to play a short and good game."

Milkmaid of the Milky Way is a nice adventure game with retro graphics and a simple inventory interface. You play as Ruth, who runs a small farm in the fjords. You hear strange noises and find things go missing. This is always helpful in adventure games as it provides instant puzzles! Find your items, take care of your herd and make the dairy products necessary to sell in town. Well, sort of. It appears that sales aren't all they used to be. Still, another day but now your herd is gone. Kidnapped by aliens. The only thing to do is hop on board and figure out what is going on.The game does all the dialogue in rhyme (I'm not clever enough to do the review that way, for I'd soon run out of things to say). The interface is easy and the goals of the puzzles are pretty straight forward. The game is not totally linear in that you can explore as you want and pick up objects as you find them, not in some particular order. The story is a classic good vs. evil presented in a straight forward but not frightening or dystopia like mannner.The colors are bright, the artwork is simple and lively and care went into creating characters with personality. If a nice adventure game is your thing, you will be pleasantly entertained here."

The all-rhyme narration isn't always on point, but still manages to be very charming in a fairytale/storybook kind of way, and the somewhat clunky ""drag-and-release""-inferface when it comes to using your inventory is balanced out with great puzzles that give just the exact amount of challenge without being old-school-impossible or stupid. A truly recommended buy for anyone into the point-n-click adventure game genre."

I wish it was a bit longer, since I had a good time while playing it, but at the current price point, I find the length to be fair for the price. I would gladly have paid more for a longer game though.Puzzle-wise, it might be a bit on the easy side, but that seems to be a general trend with most puzzle games these days. Parts of the reason why it is easy is that it has few interaction points, thus limiting your options. It makes it easier to figure out the correct solution, and even if you should feel stuck, there is a very limited number of things to try. It is not a complete pushover though.I also loved the tiny farm high up in the cliffside overlooking the fjord. Got a fjord right outside my own window, but sadly not one of those impressive views."

,Recommended,544970,29893524,Posted: 12 February,all,Abbanilla,"This is an enjoyable, short point-and-click game. The art is remniscient of the early 1990s Sierra point and clicks and it is used fully to communicate all of the emotions and movements of the story. In-game comments and dialogue are all written in poetic, rhyming verse: ""I picked up the empty jar. Now, where was the bar?"" In its entirety, the game took about an hour for me to complete with full exploration of screens and item combinations. Although there's a certain charm to the rhyming words, especially the error messages for wrong combinations, you will find that you are not rewarded for creativity in problem solving nor are you guided by your mistakes with relevant feedback, an issue common in the genre.Keep your expectations in pace with the game's design and you'll find, my friend, there's no reason to whine."

It does have a surprise I wasn't expecting! The characters you'll meet will make you smile (especially two perverted old ladies!) and care for them.The graphics are simply gorgeous! I love retro style, especially when it's so well done. For me, good looking adventure games are really important: the, if you're stuck, you can simply take your time, enjoy the beautiful scenery and run around, searching for what you might have missed.The puzzles are just the right difficulty, nothing that would make you go ""well how the hell I was supposed to know that?!"". Perhaps for very experienced players it might be too easy though: you will know what you need to do most of the time, it's just a matter of figuring out how. One negative thing I might say is that I had to use a walk-through couple times since it seems I wasn't clicking just the right pixels.Overall, I simply loved this game. For me it hit just the right spot: the atmosphere, the gameplay, everything is just right"

76561198066568951,Recommended,544970,29111330,Posted: 8 January,all,neilmccauly,"This game is the definition of charming.It's short but not abrupt, and manages to tell a full, well-rounded narrative: a light fantasy set in space, a Grimm fairy tale crossed with soft sci-fi. Despite the delicate tone, it never shies from emotional or serious moments. And the artwork! The artwork is straight out of a storybook, with lively animations that are surprisingly detailed for chunky pixel art. A lot of effort went into giving the characters a sense of personality and uniqueness, and it always shows.The main criticism I would level at this game are the puzzles: they're commonly average at best. Neither clever nor challenging. Not ridiculous like point-and-clicks of old, but poorly signposted if not very awkwardly designed. They're not hard puzzles; just awkward. There's not much satisfaction in overcoming them, but the story and artwork make it all worth it.EDIT: An update adds mouse-over animation to interactive hotspots, which I think vastly improves the experience. My older review, which is now mostly irrelevant:[My last criticism is minor. The user interface is strangely dead for such a beautiful game. The cursor never, ever changes. So when you mouse over the scene there is zero feedback to the user, thus there is literally no way to tell if something can be interacted with. No highlighting, no text labels, nothing. You don't know what's clickable or not. The game is still highly functional without this sense of feedback, but there is a deadness to the interaction. There is no ""game feel"" to the navigation, which takes away some sense of coherence in how I explored the environments, which in the end affected my immersion.]All in all, if you like point-and-clicks then I think this is a must-play for the charm and personality it exudes, as well as for the few but surprising turns the story takes. The average-to-awkward puzzles may prevent it from being a classic, but it's still a standout."

I almost never complete games, theres only about three or four games in my Steam library I've finished completely, and only one other made me interested enough to finish it in one sitting. The graphics are simple but detailed enough to create a definite aesthetic, the music perfectly fits each scene it accompnies and the story is charming and engaging. What I connected with the most though was all the dialoge and text being completely in rhyme. While a little off rhythm in some parts, it held a child-like wonder to the story that connected to my heart. The innocence to Ruth and her cow friends was so sweet and kind I felt such a personal connection to them.I'm excited to playthrough again in French this time, but I'm confident that even in another language the emotion will still be there."
,Recommended,544970,33366890,Posted: 8 July,all,markzwaan,"Despite it's short length I enjoyed playing this game. It has charming retro pixelated graphics, an interesting story and some nice puzzles. Two things bothered me though. First of all the main menu lacks a quit/exit/stop option so I had to use ALT-F4 to exit the game. The other thing is more troubling and it's the rhyme. I bought the game because I liked the art I saw in the screenshots and I have a weakness for science fiction. And ever since I discovered the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, also for fjords. But I was wondering whether the rhyme would really add something to the game or if it would be nothing more than a cheap gimmick. Unfortunately it's the latter.In my opinion the game would have been better if they hadn't tried to make every two sentences rhyme. While the sentences do in fact rhyme (most of the time at least, there is some weak and false rhyme here and there) there is no meter at all. Sentences that rhyme are of different length and have different rhythms. I'll use the rhyme visible in one of the screenshots as an example.""The trail up here will someday be my death"", Erlend said, short of breath.I'll visualise my problems with this rhyme by using italic text to note unstressed syllables and bold text to note stressed syllables:""Thetrailupherewillsomedaybemydeath"",Erlendsaid,shortofbreath.You can see that the first part of the sentence contains 10 syllables and the second part only 6. Instead of having a steady rythm of stressed/unstressed or unstressed/stressed syllables, there is little to no rythm in the stressed and unstressed syllables especially in the second part of the sentence. If you would have to read all of the text in this game out loud, it would be almost impossible to make it sound natural.This could have been fixed by slightly changing the text to something like:""Thetrailupherewillbemydeath"",saidErlend,beingshortofbreath.It's still no prose, but now both parts of the sentence have 8 syllables and there is a more natural sounding rhythm of unstressed and stressed syllables. If the entire game would have used proper meter like this, the sentences would have flowed better and the rhyme would have added something to the game.Unfortunately this isn't the case and almost all rhyming sentences exhibit the same problem throughout the game. It makes the text hard to read and often it's clear that words were chosen not because they made sense but merely because they happened to rhyme.It's not bad enough to give this game a thumbs down, because I did like it overall. But the way rhyme is used it's clearly no more than a gimmick."

Puzzles are mostly logical and well designed. About medium difficulty.The rhyming of the text got a bit questionable at certain times.Overall highly recommend."

I'm only an hour in and this game is so stinking cute.The puzzles are fairly intuitive and won't cause you to agonize over solving them. The story flows brilliantly, the scenery is wide and beautiful, and the soundtrack is enchanting. The story is quirky enough to keep my attention and I can't wait to play the rest of it this weekend."

,Recommended,544970,30294212,Posted: 3 March,all,Barthymeus,"""Milkmaid of the Milky Way"" is a great click-and-point game made by one Norwegian man all by himself. As a Norwegian myself, I'm proud of this game and his accomplishments.The game contains a new, fresh and pretty original story, easy yet lovely to watch pixel-graphic, and nice soundtrack. One of the game's special features, is the rhyming in every sentence. In the beginning, it can be funny or a bit annoying, but one gets used to it after a while.The game itself isn't too hard, yet not too easy. It's just perfect, making you scratch your head at times, and have an ""Eureka!"" moment once you solve the puzzles.The game's price isn't too high, but it could yet be a little bit lower, in my opinion.All the achievements can be reached in a single play-through.I even met the developer, Mattis Folkestad, at EGX Rezzed in London on Saturday 1th of April. Had a nice chat and praised his game, which he deeply appreciated. He even told me some ""secret"" background information about his game!Overall, I personally would give ""Milkmaid of the Milky Way"": 7/10"

Milkmaid of the Milky Way made me feel like I was swept up in intrigue and adventure right off the bat.Writing style in rhymes allows for laughs and reminds you that it doesn't take itself too seriously.Most of the puzzles are intuitive and rewarding once completed.Great music, interesting animation/graphics perspectives, likeable characters. I really enjoyed playing this game!"

Some puzzles left me momentarily baffled as to how to solve them at the beginning, but once you get used to the logic of the game, you start solving the puzzles quicker.I actually liked the pixelated design of the game, and the soundtrack is something worth listening to, it suits the feeling of the game really well. All in all, this game was definitely worth the price and the play."
76561198071390745,Recommended,544970,33479011,Posted: 12 July,all,Kat,"A short (3.7h), but quite well-written adventure game. At the beginning I was a bit put out by the overly pixelated graphics, but the story drew me to the extent that the imagination compensated for the lack of clarity. THe puzzles are quite logical, with 1-2 exceptions towards the end. I think it's a good game for young people given it's rhyming story and teaching message. Regarding the price, I always assess the games as a ratio between the hours of enjoyment/price. In this case it would be a negative ratio (3.7/5.99), but it's a good effort and I hope to see more from the developper."
,Recommended,544970,33749820,Posted: 23 July,all,robinvanrijn9,"A sweet and thoughtful game. I picked this up during a steam sale and I finally got around to playing it. It's very enjoyable to play, the puzzles are little easy but who wants to spend hours wandering around the same rooms trying x object on y scene object until getting something that works? The graphics are quite simple but you can tell that a lot of effort went into making the scenes and characters memorable. It's rare to see someone stick with a certain style and play with constructs of said style and approach things like cutscenes in a different kind of way than I've seen before. A very good find!"

The bulk of the puzzles are easy, but the game ends with several that are medium, and they are all sensibly designed.Okay: so you're a Norwegian milkmaid on a high-altitude dairy farm.  Your best friend is a cow named Lykke.  You get up one morning to make the cheese . . . and aliens come.  To say more would spoil it.  It's an unusual tale to say the least!This little gem is highly recommended for devotees of pixel art, puzzling, and music fromHearts of Space."
