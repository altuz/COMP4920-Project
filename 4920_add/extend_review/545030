,Recommended,545030,26269468,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,Erbkaiser,"NSFW is a game where you play short sessions in your 'working week'. Every day you start by reading email and accepting a task, sometimes from multiple choices, then stare at a screen of your work. Every so often co-workers pass by, heralded by their footsteps.Just like real work, doing this gradually drains your soul and leads to death... err game over.Instead of working, you can right-click at any time to change the work screen into something more fun. These can be non-interactive small films you can watch, or small mini-games. You can right-click to go back to work at any time and should do so as soon as you hear footsteps, because ALL your co-workers will snitch on you, leading to you being fired (game over).The longetivity of this game is in unlocking all the various mini-games and small movies, which you pay for with your working day salary. As days go by the company starts to notice someone is abusing the system and it becomes more and more difficult to keep your actions hidden, as special checks may occur at given times, etc.Recommended if you like a little naughty humour."

Or doing some unrelated things to distract your workload? And yet you totally don't want to taint your real-life career?YES this game is perfect for you!People who knows how stressfull workplace can do for your mental could relate to this game so much. Heck, even people who haven't work yet can relate this so much. Everyone loves thrills, right?So to make it simple, the purpose of this game is to make you looks like working with styles; and you must keep your mental healthy by doing ""fun things"". It's casual game, yet it has complex details. The variety of videos and little comedy on it are interesting. Fitures to interact with workmates is refreshing. Plus, retro 8-bit style have its own charms for sure.Pretty recommended for people looking for casual retro game to spend time. Just don't forget not to play it on your workplace, it's Not a Simulator for Working!"

At the start I was getting fired for watching porn but later on I was getting fired for NOT watching any porn. It's a careful balance all due to the fact that we play as a man who can't survive an hour without looking at some hot scissor porn (literal scissors).I expected little from this game but I am really surprised by how fun it is.
,Recommended,545030,33250923,Posted: 4 July,all,yUh,"Oh boy, this game knows how to make its player's salty - and that's not a bad thing.I finished this game in about 5.5 hours, but you could pretty easily do it in one sitting if you really know what you're doing.The character design is extremely charming, and despite the simple style and 'story', it still allows for dynamic and different characters.There are some translation issues (the game was originally in Indo.), but this is commonplace for translated indie games. It's not an issue and overall does not impede understanding or gameplay.Overall, the game takes a simple mechanic a long way, and it's way more than meets they eye. It's saddening that there is not a larger fanbase for this game! Easy way to lose some time; and yes, it is possible to get every achievement.Totally recommended!edit: good lord, please, for your own sake, WEAR HEADPHONE WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME."

It's a very simple game mechanic, but very challenging to NOT GET CAUGHT!One thing I found while playing this on an airplane, is that headphones make it MUCH easier to hear footsteps, and cart wheels before getting caught.  That said, why was I playing this in public...."

,Recommended,545030,28471479,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,RipWitch,"During the boring hours of work, do you ever wish you could do something else? To still be paid for playing rather than working? NSFW - Not a Simulator For Working explores this concept.StoryYou play as a Stefan, a new employee working at NSF&W. The first week on the job is to see how you would do if you were hired. But it doesn't go exactly as planned as you become bored very quickly, and NSF&W can't have a bored employee. Despite disliking your new job, Stefan must find a way to stay happy which manifest as naughty videos. Can you last the whole week without getting caught?GameplayNSFW has a pretty standard gameplay. Make sure you're Fun Scale doesn't run out while also making sure no one sees you watching the videos. You can hear the foot steps of your coworkers a few seconds before they come through the door, giving you some time to click off of the videos. You have an option of making some small talk, cut them off if they start the conversation, or let them walk by. Just watch your fun scale and make sure your coworkers are out of site.However, it gets more difficult as you continue playing. The job and the videos have different modes, which act as minigames. With each upgrade, the minigames become more interactive, and in turn louder. The moans activated when you earn hearts. This can easily take your attention away if you're not careful. While it doesn't seem significant to do the minigames for the jobs, it does in the simulator mode. Whether your actually doing your job or not, the minigames can quickly take your mind off of the objective. The minigames serve as a way to earn currency, one for getting jobs (which shows after the campaign) and one to get more videos. Checks also become more frequent and hidden. This gives more depth as you can hear the coworkers, but you can't hear the check unless it's too late. Other conditions are added, such as no talking day, to add to the difficulty as you try to not get fired.The coworkers, while pegged to be annoying, do have some depth. Each character talks, acts, and work in a different area in NSF&W. You have options to befriend them, which gives you more about their background and more videos, having specific interactions that increase your reputation. In any other situation, these characters would be interesting to interact with. However, most of them snitch on you. If NSF&W wasn't so forgiving, how would you get money for videos?SoundNSFW uses sound as it's main advantage and disadvantage. You can hear coworkers coming with footsteps or the squeaking of wheels but the moans from the videos almost drowns out everything. If you don't listen closely, the day will end quickly. Despite this, the sound is balanced in a way that you can still hear the signs of your coworkers coming under the moans.Art StyleNSFW has a pizelated style throughout the gameplay. The office, workers, and the videos each stand out by themselves, with the minigames only including coins or hearts to distinguish them from everything else. The coworkers have a simple walking and reactions animations that draw attention as they walk past. This is different from the various job animations that completes in junks instead of bits at a time. While the videos include eye catching color and different animations from the rest. This truely succeeds in making work boring and watching naughty videos fun.PerformanceNSFW runs pretty well. The only lag that might show would be in the minigames, but it quickly goes away.ReplayabilityThe Campaign might seem like that is all to the game, along with if you search up gameplay, but that is untrue. Once you survive the 7 days another mode appears. This allows players to get all of the videos, while having the player buy the programs needed to do various jobs. This is endless, as long as you are determined to play it can deliver. Steam achievements encourages more gameplay which can easily be achieved in this mode. Once all videos are collected, another mode is unlocked to view all of the videos.Overall+ Artwork+ Various emails are entertaining+ Balancing of working and watching videos+ Added difficulty in forms of conditions and hidden checks- Some of the minigames might not be enjoyable- Can be tiresome after reading all the emails and trying to get all achievementsNSFW - Not a Simulator For Working as all about balance. Would you work more or play more? Listen closely between moans for coworkers and watch the time. Make friends with your coworkers while you are still working at NSF&W and unlock secret videos with them as the star. All-in-all NSFW- Not a Simulator For Working is a good game to play during the weekend. This will certainly keep your fun scale up."

Took roughly 5 hours to beat the game and unlock everything. While it lacks much replay value beyond obtaining 100% completion, the very fair $2.99 regular price is a bargain for this little charming time-killer."

Will return to complete all the achievements bit later, even the achievement hunting is pretty fun in this light weight, but truly captivating game. Easily worth the money spent to it.Only thing I wish that could be improved is to have more interraction when talking to your co-workers (like some actual discussions that you have to reply to or something) and have them react to you differently based on how much they like you."
