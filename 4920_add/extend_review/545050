New concept, new environment.BUT.If your not ready for a real EA, with little in the ' gameplay ' dept. Limited crafting at the moment.. then stay away.It has some criticism going at the moment, which is kind of sad that most all of the negatives I looked over had zero input on the game, but instead focused on it being an EA. Which is all it has been announced as.The graphics do a good job at this stage, especially for distortion at distance ( much like the real desert does ) and its no secret they are not done.The animations do feel a bit wooden in most parts. No secret there either.Not a lot to actually do yet. No secret again.If your looking for a new take on ' surviving '.. and your interested in something in a place / culture most people have zero understanding of. This may be up your alley. BUT again.. at this point.. if your not really one that understands EA or that a game in EA for barely a few days is not going to be a golden filled to the top cup of things.. Then dont touch it. Its not ready for you.Check back in a few months. If it keeps going. Great.If it falls flat on its face like a few other EA's.. then I ll be back to update.:-)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSAJ0l4OBHMActually... I named my Camel Bartholomew...."

But the only problem I see wrong with this game is the performance no matter what settings I have it on the fps sits around 35-20, then some places it will drop to 15-5 for a second or two. But other than the performace I would 100% recommend this game."

It's got a very unique feel to it, and I look forward to playing a completed version. However, you should be aware before buying that the game is (as stated) not even close to complete.  I have explored far and wide and  found each of the possible POI that can spawn. I killed a few animals, stole a ton of stuff. General shenanigans.Currently, the only reason I can see for anybody buying this game,  is to support the developers in hopes that they are able to put out a solid finished product. As is, there is very little that I would call a game. I am still saying thumbs up, though, because I feel like it's a nice unique idea with a lot of promise."

I understand that Early access is a way for them to do large scale testing of a product, but your product must still have some functionality for people to be able to even test it.  There is also no auto reporting system, which means you must manually submit an email to let them know when/how it crashedI had to refund my purchase as in the hour or so i played the game crashed 7 times.   every time you go into an area with people in it, the game mysteriously bogs down and then freezes.I have a more then powerful enough computer too and it still happens.I cannot recommend you buy this game at this time.[computer specs]1tb HD16gb Ram2gb GeForce 1050Dual AMD processors 3.4ghz(im able to run Farcry 4 on ultra settings at a minimum of 70frames a sec)Edit: Please note this review was made on June 6th of 2017, major updates may or may not have happened since then, you are encouraged to do some research beyond my review."

While the vehicles are amazing both in control and in design detail, the player's controls are less so.  The user interface is very clunky and some of the features from the trailer (boats, biplanes, locations) are not present (or at least I was unable to locate) in the actual game.The world is largely devoid of detail, the NPCs are bland, etc.  This is all expected of a product at such an early developmental stage.I am glad I purchased this product, but if you are more fiscally constrained, add it to your wish list and keep an eye on it."

Sound is not in rest with real arabian voice acting, and all the small details in the world who totally immerse you in that world !!!I would only like the dev to add real quests maybe, make it less sandboxy, like a small storyline or something, could really add so much charm to the game !!I am waiting to see more of this game !!!Recommended )"

Frames seem smooth too even when entering and leaving a town. Only occasionally did I see a frame skip but it was rare and occasional. This is a very new game so content is light. This will improve over time. No real complaints. Although I would like to see a change when you running with shift and after awhile he starts sprinting from the run. I would like to be able to trigger sprint on my own and not have it automatic. Like maybe hitting forward twice or something. Also English subtitles because some of the npcs are speaking what i can only assume is Arabic or some other close dialect. Dont speak that language so I dont know what they say. Probably a greeting if I had to guess. Other than that pretty cool so far. Kinda hard finding supplies to survive and not starve to death or die of thirst though it is a desert afterall. Stay in the shade in the hottest part of the day. The heat is brutal. If you want to be a sand dweller here ya go. Very fun in its early stage."

I just had to have it.Something absolutely different than other games in the same genre. Those who have played Minecraft (or similar games) know that usually the hardest ""world"" to survive is the desert. This is all set in the desert, so I think has huge potential of being different and challenging! Also, although at the moment not implemented just yet, there's going to be sea (and sailing on it), pearl diving, and if I can believe one of the trailers I'd say ""Stranded Deep-esque"" beaches.At the moment, kind of empty, still, but it was released on Alpha (now 1.2 update) and they do not lie about this. It's clearly stated on the title screen, too.The UI really surprised me, there are actually already a butt-load of things to craft (especially when it comes to clothes) and everything works pretty smooth (especially considering this is early access!).Sure, it need work, polishing, content added, but so far I have been thoroughly enjoying this game, and there is something about the desert. It's quiet (except for the loud-as-f camel), at the moment it just goes on and on and on, but you never know what's behind the next sand-dune.One experience I had was basically:Walking to a camp, stealing/borrowing a camel, wandering off into the desert.Saw an animal, shot it, skinned it, climbed back on top of the camel and continued my journey in search for riches.15 minutes and a lot of sand (but no riches) later, I see a dead animal.Turns out it's the same animal I shot 15 minutes earlier! I'd gone round in a circle.I'm getting hungry and thirsty, so decide to make my way back to the nearby camp.Can't find it, it gets dark, I get stuck in a sandstorm, the camel doesn't want to move anymore and I die of hunger and thirst in the desert, probably just 1 sand-dune away from the camp.Conclusion: No, it is not a finished game, but still, compared to some of the EA titles that have been released on Steam, this game looks pretty polished!Love the concept, the setting is interesting (and I think with the addition of the sea coming in one of the EA updates will become even more interesting) and is definitely setting it apart from other titles of the same genre.Also, horses and camels! (And in future boats) which is already cool by itself.One other thing to mention, by the way, is that this company (Semaphore) has already released at least 1 other game on Steam, which is good to know that they have actually finished something in the past (the dangerous thing with first-time indie companies is that they start a project and never finish, this company has a released game).I definitely recommend the game to any survival-game lover interested in EA titles and who is intrigued by the Arabian setting.If you have no idea what EA is and you're expecting a completed title, stay away for now, keep an eye on the forum and come back when they've reached Beta-phase or full release."

,Recommended,545050,26582315,"Posted: 13 November, 2016",all,Shahmat,"This game is not very playable at the moment, due to a lack of content and poor performance, however, this game definitely has a lot of potential and I look forward to when it gets better. The first thing that needs to be fixed is the performance, this game really needs to be optimized, it is still somewhat playable, but if you buy it now, be prepared for lag spikes and a lower than expected fps. This game also needs much more content, things could be implemented such as bandit npcs (they would wander the desert and try to kill you if they saw you), travelling Bedouin groups, a better gun/ammo system (each gun has its own caliber of bullet, also some more guns couldn't hurt), and the ability to set up camp in the desert (you could have tents and other camp equipment stored on the camels). Things like this would add more depth/immersion to the game. Also it would be great if the developers added a 1st person view option, and slowly improved the textures for the landscape (after the game is better optimized), as this game is mostly about wandering the desert, so having the landscape look as good as possible would make the game much more enjoyable. Overall, the game is not that fun at the moment (it's still in Alpha, so this is not an issue), however it has a lot of potential, as the idea behind the game is great, it just needs the performance to be fixed, and some more features to make the game less empty. I definitely reccomend buying this game though, as by doing that you are supporting the devs and making it more likely that the game will turn out to be great in the future."

(It's still an Early Access)The crafting system is good.There are several types of weapons, clothes and vehicles - mounts.The highlight of the game is obviously the exploration, there are several things to be discovered and NPCs to interact and trade.One must be careful to Stamina, Hunger, Thirst and Temperature:- The weapons will be used to hunt various wild animals not hostile. (Or even to break some objects and physics by which this occurs is quite cured)- The oases and water sources will be used precisely for the thirsty and power fill your water pouch.- The clothes and some areas to protect against temperatures and weather conditions.- For the Stamina you can also sleep somewhere.The weak points of the game are:Even optimization to improve.Various Bug to solve.With the alpha 1.4 the devs will put the wolves, the first hostile wild animals to defend themselves and use weapons, but apart from the wolves the only threats to your health are those mentioned above and in the long time might get tired for this.BUT IF the game continues to be developed and supported, the devs will add enemy soldiers, bandits, enemies Bedouins and other dynamic events, in the trailer on official site you can see assaults on trains and even aircraft to watch.This game has really great potential to become one of the best of its kind, definitely recommended for fans of the genre and for those who want to try this type of games.NOTE: You need to have a medium/high-end computer to run it decently during the development phase, check the minimum requirements of the game and consult the forum before purchasing."

While the setting is certainly appealing given the multitude of games set either on tropical islands or in lush forests, the actual game suffers from some crippling issues that have become trope-worthy when referencing the genre. These issues are not the main reason for this first impression, but they do not help the game's case when justifying the $18 price tag. The real problem is found with the lack of viable content and the restrictions currently in place. Make no mistake, I understand the process of alpha stages and Early Access, but for the sake of others, this warning must be presented.The video options are still plagued by the dreaded discard request and thankfully I was able to get certain features to turn off after two forced shut downs. It took three tries for me to successfully switch them again, however, restricting my tests of the graphical settings to the bare minimum and the custom setting seen in the video. Having played an hour with both, it is safe to say I was suffering massive frame rate drops and fluctuations on both settings. Max FPS was around 40 and minimal FPS ranged from 5 to 20. Stuttering was also a major problem and occurred frequently in isolated areas as well as in villages.Content consists of exploring the desert, trading with the few NPCs you can interact with and surviving. The desert has some barren ruins to locate, villages with chests that can be lock picked, airfields that yield armored vehicles and smaller locals including oases. Airfields are going to provide the bulk of the crafting items by salvaging wrenches and tires. These salvaged goods can then be traded for coins with the few trader NPCs and instantly defeat the threat of stamina loss and hunger. Acquiring a vehicle also defeats the purpose of crafting weaponry, providing a turret that has unlimited ammunition. The only killable targets in the game are certain animals, so weaponry at this point is pointless. Villagers are impervious to bullets, cannot be run over or die from explosions (which can kill you if you purposely hit the vehicle with its' turret).The underlining issue is with the game's lack of danger and motivation. Crafting is limited to certain resources, weapons, consumables and equipment, but it lacks the ability to build structures. Coin is easy to acquire by salvaging items from the airfields which makes the need to hunt for food (which can be bought instead) pointless. Death is possible by neglecting survival needs, but the game doesn't have any predators. Once you make the weapons you want, outfit your character the way you want and acquire a vehicle, you have pretty much experienced the entirety of the game (which I managed to do in less than a hour). It doesn't help that the preset gear available during character creation can give the player what they want without even touching the crafting system. It might be useful when a colossal amount of content and gear is introduced for crafting, but it eliminates one of the only gameplay features available in the game at this time.I hate throwing the term ""tech demo"" around too often, but this really does feel like a proof of concept over anything. The weather system is broken (freezing while the temperature is scorching hot), character animations are clunky, and the UI leaves something to be desired. I wish I could say more, but their really is nothing else to add with the limited quality released so far. At this point in time, I cannot recommend this to anyone.This has been a EAW PSA."

The game is being made by ""Semaphore Lab"" A Arabian Company Its not too often you see that do you? ;)FeaturesBadiya (As of Alpha 1) Has Surviving, Food, Hunger Thirst and Tempurature, Airstrips, Camps, Acient Ruins, Towns, Oasis, Oil Wells, Water Wells, etc. The game also features an infinite procedural open world that keeps generating as you go. Players can also trade with NPCs in towns and camps to earn cash witch he can use to buy things Clothes, Food, Guns, etc.The game also features a number of vehicles Armored Cars, Horses, Camels, and Dune buggy's aswell. As of this moment the game dosent offer much content (As Of Alpha 1) it seems to be the base core gameplay so far.TechnologyBaydiya Uses Unity 5 (As Of Alpha 1) This allows for Things such as dynamic clay destruction physics, Detailed procedural textures. Cloth physics (Future Alpha)  And Dynamic weather. From rain to snow with different intensities. To Sandstorms and snowstorms with different intensities. There are also some sort of Volumetric clouds in the game aswell. The game also has Pretty okay graphics and with many different settings to tweak for the prefered performance.PerformanceSo far the game isint very optomized (As Of Alpha 1.2) This is a warning to anyone who buys beware the optomization is not finished just yet and Semaphore is still working on it. There are many settings you can tweak aswell but it only makes a mild difference in performance. If you are an AMD User like me beware i would recommend having Nvidia than AMD for now to run this game.The CommunityThe devs seem to listen to their community alot if you have a bug than just apply it on the discussions board for the devs to see. They are also planning on a Map Editor (Future Alpha) so players can Make share and edit maps for others to download and play. Co Op will also be coming in future alpha versions aswell later Multiplayer :) Mod compatibility im not sure about.Why this game is likely to get finished?Because the devs have a Roadmap in the steam description and on there website. It has a full list of features of the current alpha and upcoming ones aswell. Not only that but they also have a majority of these upcoming alpha features in private testing They just need Finalizing/poloshingUpcoming features ( this is just a small part of whats coming )The developers plan to add Underground tombs, Camping, Oceans, Boats, tropical Islands, Towns on tropical islands, By-Panes, Map editor, caves, Army Bases, AI Soldiers and bandits, Various POIs and biomes. And so much more Most of these features once again are already in private testing.Dynamic Narritive (Future Alpha)This game will eventually feature a dynamic narritive that plays different everytime so the players basicly create their own story as they go. This concept seems interesting and its very different from what many games do.FINAL REVIEWIndie gamers 7.7/10 Has lots of potientialAAA gamers 5/10Lite Gamers 7/10Stubborn Gamers 6/10 bad performanceMe: 7.8/10 Has amazing potentialAdverage Gamers 6.8/10 Good but needs improving looking forward to updatesThat is the final review of Badiya personally i would recommend checking this out but i would hold off on this till a few more patches/updates come out first then i would recommend buying it."
,Recommended,545050,29936548,Posted: 14 February,all,Abu Dubai Riyadh,"Badiya is a very good and somewhat-easy survival game. While it is still indeed in early-access and has many features 'locked' (like Story Mode, Map Editor, etc.), it's fun to look around and absorb the atmosphere and inhale the occasional sandstorms that blast through.For graphics, there are still some bugs that need to be squashed, like floating scenery and interactable items, and the options seem to reset itself every time you have to restart after dying. Don't let this be a major downside though, the game is still playable (I have an NVIDIA 1060 and it runs smoothly on High)!I have survived at a maximum for four days (I died trying to fight off two wolves with no proper tools, and yes, I regret it), encountering camps, villages, ruins, and an unmonitored oil well placed in the middle of nowhere, far from civilization. I did try to spend some time looking for things as seen in the thumbnails on the Store Page, like the armored car/tank hybrids and the steam trains, but found none.I am looking forward to the next updates and eventually, the Beta version and the final product! A good feature I recommend adding is the option to have your player speak using a drop-down menu of a list of words to say and the NPC's interact and respond differently to what you tell them.Keep up the good work, Semaphore! (cool name, too!)"
76561198069408997,Recommended,545050,26646599,"Posted: 17 November, 2016",all,Nilloc,"I think this game has a ton of potential to open some eyes in the west to the culture of the east, which is nice. But would I suggest the game right now? Not really unless you want to just roam the desert looking at stuff, because there isn't much else to do at the moment. Now for a more indepth review of the bits of the game I got into during my brief escapade.Graphics: It is a very pretty looking game in regards to the terrain, as for character models and items... it's alright I guess, it's not the best but far from some stuff I've seen from indie games. But when you are sat on a mountain at sunset in the desert it's a very good looking game.Performance: If you computer isn't a gaming build I'd suggest staying away or turning the graphics down, this game is not very well optimized and has a bas issue with occasionally just losing all the frames for a moment or two.Gameplay: It's very bare bones right now, the shooting is not very enjoyable but it isn't a huge deal, riding can be fun but can get old, and vehicles can drive right up the side of a mountain, as can horses and camels. Didn't find any planes so no comment there, same with the boats but I think those will be in the game later, crafting is tedious and requires a lot of materials for most stuff, lockpicking was a nightmare, but that may just be me. Story doesn't exist yet, so no comment.Audio: THE CAMELS SOUND LIKE THEY NEED TO SEE A VET SOON!!! The music, while nice is very limited in diversity and mostly just loops endlessly based off of what you are doing. The weapons all sound more or less the same, voice actors are decent enough.Long story short, if you want action in the middle east of world war one, go play battlefield 1. If you want to explore a desert, then this will do. If you want a deeper game like this, wait a bit and come back to this game and see what they've done. I hope to see more great progress as this game is in alpha and is already further along than some indie games that are in their ""beta"" stage."

But I can see that this game has potential to become something much more than just a survival game. There is a lot to fix such as graphical and gameplay issues. I once slept for 1 hour and died. I won't recommend this game to  those who are impatient and cant wait for new features and fixes to come out.

I played for a few hours and after I got used to the controls I found it very original. Crafting is simple enough, and I have been lucky enough in game to find oil rigs, air strips, villages and a whole host of interesting things.Here are the points that need to be worked on in my opinion:I'm not sure why the mouse sensitivity is so ""overly"" sensitive. I played with settings for the game and my mouse and I just can't seem to find the ""sweet spot"".I really hope there will be NPC bad guys at a later date. Hunger, thirst and heat are bad- but if you are smart you can beat them. It would be nice to loot some random bandits or enemy soldiers.Please remove the warning label stickers on the corrosive barrels and the flammable barrels. This game is set circa 1916 and the labels aren't right for the period. Painted stencils would be just appropriate and an easy fix.Overall I really like this game and can't wait to see what improvements come in time!"

I didn't see any other ""moving"" tanks around but i did find some tanks, killed some animals and drove until it ran out of fuel. Cool implementation with the fuel though - not a lot of other things around. The game is in early access so a lot of things are not in the game yet, for instance you can't punch or kill any of the civilians? you can't punch or shoot any animals either which is kinda boring because with open world like this you should be able to do about anything in my opinion. The clothing options are awesome though, so far I don't see the ""end goal"" or any ""goal"" of the game besides surviving.

76561198067207576,Not Recommended,545050,32150251,Posted: 3 June,all,Dawg711,Hey guys I am writing this review because I just refunded this game. Sadly at this time the game is not really a game. Many things that are said to be in game such as map editor and even a simple Jump function are NOT. They added AI yes but if you are near them your FPS goes in the tiolet. Clearly no in house testing was done at all to see if things were ready. You can not add code and throw it to the masses. Yes it is EA but still things released should have some functionality.For right now just sit and watch this game. At some point it may be worth it. To me I was not going to hold onto it if they can not get things like Jump to work. Also watching a video by the Devs telling me the map editor works when clearly it does not at all it is a greyed out function. That right there does not sit well. Keeps me from trusting.If anyone has question about the game I would be happy to answer. I gave the game 93 mins before refund.To devs if you see this. I found a ranch with AI and FPS was fine but without jump all I could do was run in guns blazing. Though sadly had no ammo because I used it all bring a wolf to half life. With the knife I was able to kill 3 guys with guns before they got me.......When I found the AI at the Airfield my FPS went to 1. I changed settings down to medium and that did nothing.I would not mind helping the devs with this game but my cash right now would be better spent elsewhere. If I could get a complementary copy I would be happy to put in at least 1 hour with every update to test things and report bugs. If the price was under 10 I might even have kept the game.For all concerned with my specsi7-4770 @3.0GHz16GB RAMSSD Drive1060 GPUWin 10
