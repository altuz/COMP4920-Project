,Not Recommended,545110,29540340,Posted: 28 January,all,Tatsuya Hiroki,I managed to brick my netbook with this  in a way that I had to make a complete OS reinstallThis offers literally NOTHING more that you cannot steadily do by yourself in a much safer way. Do yourself a favor and stay the hell away from any IObit related software.

I used it to update a massive amount of things after my audio stopped working and i didn't know how to re-install it. It fixed it, and a lot of other things. But, after 2 days of using it right, My computer motherboard♥♥♥♥♥♥the bed, my internet adapter almost fried, and other amounts of issues from this entire app. I had to system restore to when i got this gaming computer for Christmas, and my internet is still almost♥♥♥♥♥♥now, and i am currently resolving that problem. I have no money to get a brand new gaming wifi adapter at the moment and this app has caused the one i barely have to work as a simple office adapter. Thank you."

Luckily I was able to revert back to default.Most likely because it doesn't even install the drivers with the usual method by opening an extra window where you can choose different install options.I really don't suggest using it, it may break your entire PC by downloading incompatible drivers.Sometimes it suggests for me to download drivers that aren't even available from official driver supporters.Only thing I use this for is when I want to check if there are any new drivers available so I can download them from official sources.Do not buy this, just take your time to find the compatible drivers manually. I've read that this has broken people's entire PCs by simply downloading an incompatible driver."

Especially 'bout the driver, like VGA for an onboard pc, it's so hard to find tho, and when i met this software, my face be like ""whoa"" ""wohoo"" ""WHAA"". This the most amazing software i ever used, cause it didn't to pay to installing the driver. I also recommend this, 10/10 yeah definitely 10/10, because first time i met this is on Steam XD"
,Recommended,545110,30118571,Posted: 23 February,all,Byte01,Good piece of software. I am using it on multiple machines and it got all my drivers up to date. I used it because I never update non GPU drivers and thought it was about time to get them back into the present; it worked and I experienced no issues whatsoever.

,Recommended,545110,29732918,Posted: 5 February,all,Tidreit,"The fact that driver booster 4 is out and has not as much change from v3, the only thing i can say is the only reason to get this is for the free version. The lifetime upgrade is only there for a short amount of time until they skip to the next product."
,Recommended,545110,29636125,Posted: 1 February,all,CodeManDeluxe,This tool works great for me. It found updates for things I couldn't find but had been looking for. It also told me about a few things that needed updating that I didn't know needed updated. So far it has been doing a much better job than the Windows tools alone. I have this in use on 2 other computers as well with no problems. Some of the problems other people have listed on here kinda out of control. like the BSOD? wow sucks to be that guy. But like I was saying Windows alone doesn't seem to know everything but still tends to step in and let me know if something I'm trying to do might not turn out right. I'm still left with having to make educated guesses from time to time. Maybe I'm better at doing that than some of these other folks are. So I'm avoiding alot of where these problems are coming from. I have seen people mess up their computers pretty bad with all sorts of different software and updates. Simply by clicking the wrong option or checking the wrong box. In which all should have been otherwise been harmless updates and utilities. I just don’t think with having this software on 3 different computers. That I have been lucky enough to avoid the tons of listed errors from a program plagued with said flats by luck alone. I’d like to take the time to thank the developer for making this software available. Thanks for putting it out there it works for me.

,Not Recommended,545110,29625684,Posted: 1 February,all,MisterSheepy,"So originally I gave this program amazing reviews but after using it for a bit longer I came to realize it's pure garbage. It was saying my graphics drivers(AMD) were out of date right after I updated through AMD's official tool. It then ""Updated"" my drivers back to the stone age. Would never suggest this program again."
