,Not Recommended,545250,29830709,Posted: 10 February,all,Cococonoquoa,"So this will be a walkthrough of my experience as it happened. Instead of a developer screen showing who made the game, I am greeted by a very brief page of controls that I cant review. Then on tho the main menu. So far so good. I create a character to my liking. I have to note that the jiggle physics were a little off. It seemed like everything swiveled from a single pivot point.Now to the game. First thing I notice is the movement and holy god is it bad. Its like the speed of the character resets to as if you pressed any movement button from just standing. So if you wanted to turn, you move really slow. It didnt feel fluid. Second thing i noticed was that monsters were too fast. The only reason they stopped following me was because they got stuck on a wall. Also there is no hit animation. You just get hit and everything gets bloody. You can also flip everything off which is a big plus. It doesnt do anything but its cool. Graphically, i don't have much to complain about.There are also mines you can pick up which is a good way to kill monsters but you can pick them up from so far away that it took me 3 tries to notice if there was actually a model for them you could find before you pick them up. After my 2nd try of playing, the camera stopped working so I reset the game and it worked. Then it stopped working for good so I can't even continue if i wanted to.I guess you are supposed to find 4 altars and i ran around for 10 minutes discovering new places and still only found 1. not sure what happens if you do find them all but I could not bear the controls of the game to get that far.I give this game .5/10. The .5 is from graphics. would be solid 2 if it had proper jiggle physics"

,Not Recommended,545250,29841736,Posted: 11 February,all,ครђєร,"My play time is short largely because there isn't much to this.I feel like the game itself has a baseline idea of what it wants to do but there isn't any way it will ever actually do it for mass consumption.  ""Pretty girl victimized by monsters"" is a fairly common theme in anime/hentai and that appears to be what Bloody Boobs wants to convey as a game, but lacks the complexity and capability to do it in any meaningful way as of its public release and likely never will as a product for public consumption.Positives:+ Good usage of the high level of atmospheric lighting available in Unity+ Netcode is solid+ Does what it says on the box.Negatives:- Control schema is vague and not well explained- Models and design have the polygonal and physics complexity of a TESIV: Oblivion mod- Game systems are not in place to properly achieve the intent of the projectThis is just an analytical review of the games current system dynamics and obvious design intention.So I can't recommend Bloody Boobs as a ""game"" for the general entertainment consumer on Steam. And even as a hobbyist designer I don't particularly find the project well realized in its current state. Its technically sound, but lacks any real element of horror that compels any real level of fear of victimization from the environment or the NPC based hazards and a superior experience can be achieved by using a handful of very specific Skyrim mods and dropping a character in a particularly spooky draugr tomb."

,Not Recommended,545250,29867059,Posted: 12 February,all,SidAlpha,https://youtu.be/lvrGxyMG9-UWhat can I say about Bloody Boobs that would do it justice? The sub-30fps framerate? The idiotic boob and butt jiggle? the vacuous gameplay? The simple fact that my first impressions video ended up being a complete playthrough lasting less than 10 minutes? Or the fact that this game controls like you are fighting through treacle?It is all of this and so much more. There is nothing about this game that I could find redeeming. It is an insult to the senses and to the sensibilities. The simple fact that the developer had the unmitigated gall to actually charge money for this dung-heap speaks volumes to their integrity and business ethics.1/10 - Avoid at all costs and destroy any known copy in effigy.

,Not Recommended,545250,29883270,Posted: 12 February,all,PlayBoyMan,"I was going to do a Youtube video of this game, but I have changed my mind on doing so, as I feel that this review will do just fine.PROS:Boobs - Yes there are boobs in this game, and you can adjust the size of the boobs and appearance of your character. Not a lot of variety for my tastes, but it'll do.Concept - According to the Steam store page, you are a buxom woman who is trying to avoid becoming a human sacrifice for an ancient god, and the way to escape is by finding and praying to 4 alters in a dungeon, which I'm guessing your character has escaped to.CONSGameplay - while the game does look good visually (and yes, that includes the boobs), that's where it falls short. Control layout is easy to pick up, but unless you are watching the screen a few seconds after you start the game up, you'll miss what the controls are, and will play trial and error with your keyboard. The feel of the controls are poor. They feel clumsy and cumbersome, more so when you play as the monster.Audio: The Audio is good to a certain degree - the directional audio cues are helpful in determining where the monsters are, but when it comes to being spotted by the monsters and then no longer being in their line of sight, its very delayed and becomes annoying after awhile. The sound effect for the walking monster when playing in Singleplayer also doesn't match up with the monster's movements. It sounds like he is running fast, but appears to be walking.Storyline - There isn't one. No backstory of any kind. All that I know of the backstory is from what I read on the Steam page, and even then it feels incomplete.I really wanted to give this game a chance, as it does show potential (and no I'm not talking about just the boobs), but with all the problems that are in this game at this time, I can't get into it.I've requested a refund for this game. All I can hope for is that the devs read the comments, can take criticism well and make some much needed improvements."

76561197988608713,Not Recommended,545250,29925596,Posted: 14 February,all,EatenByPie,"Why oh why didn't I glance at the reviews.In all seriousness, this is trash. Goal is reaching 4 altars, then going through the portal that reaching all 4 of them opens. There's a couple enemy types that will chase you as you do this. Line of sight doesn't matter (neither do walls), proximity is what alerts them. No strategy involved in escaping, just keep running and you'll eventually outdistance them (actually there's very little reason to not just be running at all times). Single player is buggy to the point that it's unplayable (altars don't activate, or if they do it's unreliable), and multiplayer only has 1 map. Character customization is a joke, while there are a few catagories, you end up looking pretty much the same reguardless. Also worth noting that max brightness is darker than what you see in the preview images. The gore tag shouldn't be on this, there's a snall amount of blood shown on you as you take damage (just an additional texture layered over the body, blood is always on the same spots, reguardless of where you get hit). No dismemberment, no chunks missing, nothing more than a bit of blood as you get hurt, and some blood and surprisingly clean bones on the ground. Oh, and for the horn dogs out there that are excited about the nudity tag, no, there isn't any nudity in the game (you choose between 2 skimpy outfits, bikini or a harness with nipple tape)Pro's:It's cheap? (although I don't think it was worth the $2 sale price I payed for it, would've enjoyed 2 gas station coffee's more)Con's:Poor AIBuggy1 Map"

Set the wobbly assets aside and you have a game of demons and a live sacrifice that needs to get to 4 spots and activate the pillars there to open a portal at the center of the map to get out while not getting killed by the baddies.Once you learn the map though, that's it, the game loses any replay value it may have and the co-op is only really any good (didn't try it but I'll assume) if both of you haven't played the game and are trying to figure it out as a team.

In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk and feeds infants.[2] Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development.Up to 70% of males develop pronounced or physiologically matured breasts at some point in their lives due to an endocrine disorder known as gynecomastia. In other cases, and at other periods in their lives, their bodies produce lower levels of estrogens and higher levels of androgens, namely testosterone, which suppress the effects of estrogens in developing excessive breast tissue.Subcutaneous fat covers and envelops a network of ducts that converge on the nipple, and these tissues give the breast its size and shape. At the ends of the ducts are lobules, or clusters of alveoli, where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals.[3] During pregnancy, the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, that mediate the completion of its development, namely lobuloalveolar maturation, in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding.Along with their major function in providing nutrition for infants, female breasts have social and sexual characteristics. Breasts have been featured in notable ancient and modern sculpture, art, and photography. Female breasts can figure prominently in a woman's perception of her body image and sexual attractiveness. A number of Western cultures associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts in public as immodest or indecent. Breasts and especially the nipples are an erogenous zone on women. Given the emphasis of some cultures on breast size and attractiveness, some women seek breast augmentation or other kinds of surgery to enlarge or reduce their breast size or to reverse sagging breasts.Also the demon is ♥♥♥♥ing hottest anime girl"

So there isn't much challenge aside from the sewers area. Which is mainly just forced proximity to the headless corpse enemy.It might be more interesting with a wider variety of levels (Like a roguelike) and a better weapon that fits the setting, rather than a random military grade land mine.So I'd say you can buy this as a gag, maybe on sale.

,Recommended,545250,29839666,Posted: 10 February,all,Wesley Woppits,"It's... meh. I went into it expecting it to be complete garbage but hopefully full of hilarious bugs, but, well... it's actually just okay.Some spelling errors aside (Bautiful, lol), the control isn't as bad as I was expecting from some other reviews. A little stiff, but more than playable. My biggest complaint is no private games option. Yeah, I found someone else willing to play it, but my private lobby filled up with randoms before he could join it. Said friend also couldn't even get it to let him get past character creation screen, which was weird, so he couldn't even join my game because he couldn't create a character. (EDIT: It's because he didn't name it - noob problems lol. After he got that sorted, however, the game would freeze completely on him as soon as he entered the game, but this is a hardware issue for him, not the game's fault).Another weird quirk is even if you exit the game, the lobby you created stays open (until all players that were in it leave), so if you try to re-host a server without completely restarting the game, you'll end up just rejoining the lobby you started last time. Not a huge deal if you change the lobby name, but it needs a Private Game option for sure.Overall, it's actually playable, although somewhat difficult in the first run I had. The ""lives"" you get to select is really how many hits you can take before Game Over, and 5 hits is the max, making it sort of hard when many of the enemies can outrun you. That is, when the enemies actually chase you. They give up easily, which is good, but I still managed to only find one altar on the first run, and that's because I spawned in sight of it.With some polish (read: a LOT of polish), it might be almost be good. In its current state, meh... buy it if you have $3 to waste and a friend or three who also have $3 to waste, or if you want to cheaply up your Steam Games Owned count for ePeen reasons. If you're looking at it for horny and/or forever alone reasons, don't. There are better games on Steam that fill that hole. But meh. It's okay. I've played worse games."

,Recommended,545250,29849711,Posted: 11 February,all,ANCRON,"Quick, entertaining and cheap hide and seek game with skimpy beauties versus monsters from hell, where you try your best to summon a portal and escape the cursed place.You navigate narrow corridors and dark, mysterious halls in search of 4 magical ritual stones, and activating all 4 will summon a portal to escape. Every game, location of said stones can vary, so knowing the layout and remembering the right locations is a bonus. After every successful escape you will get a victory shot of random cleavage art, which I thought was hilarious.There are two kinds of enemies. Small, headless crawlers with sharp fangs for arms that can hear you run and even walk if you are in direct line of sight. Those can be killed with mines. And there are larger ""shaved werewolf"" type of enemies that are easier to go around, yet can't be killed. You can kill the smaller monsters with mines that you can sometimes find around the level. Large monsters will only get stunned, so there's no real point in using mines on them, unless you play vs. players.If you play vs. AI then monsters have pretty average patrol routes they take, and they are easy to avoid. In co-op however one of the players control the large monster but AI monsters are also present. I have no clue of exact number of players that can join one game, and if you can play as more than one monster in one game, so feel free to correct me on that.Character customization is decent, with variety of options to the character. Hairstyles and colors, few face presets, skin colors, couple outfits and colors for them, head gear options and body slider for the meat of the game (. )( .) with working physics on top and bottom jiggles. x)It's a silly game for brainless fun and time killing with friends, with goofy monster controls and skimpy ladies trying their best to escape the literal hell, avoiding death and worse, you never know what type of monsters are they right? x)http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=861247963RIGHT!? xDP.S.

The multiplayer even works and I did a co-op playthrough with a buddy. We had a blast and I would recommend anyone with a friend get this game. Definitely worth my $2.40"

76561198118188360,Recommended,545250,29843283,Posted: 11 February,all,Palmed-Sized Taiga,"The game here is actually fairly decent. Great game, great idea for success, of course, fan service never hurts. The people who review this game with thumbs down act as if this is a game made and developed by an outstanding company, and has a very high budget. Which it does not. They also do not note that the problems they are having are in the news section of the game. And it is up to developers to fix these problems. Furthermore, this game is dirt cheap. It is not meant to be long or story heavy. It is simply a game to chill, have fun, and play with friends. Soon it might be more who knows. I am a fan of early developments, and indie gamers. This game is far from being trash, it also has a long road ahead to greatness. Definitely a game worth trying at least. The boobs is just a plus. The only things I have problems with is the lag which is a easy fix. Who ever made this game, keep up the good work.Update: Just beat the game after losing 5 times in a row. Not bad at all for a first attempt. I honestly rate the game a 6/10, but I wish to up that grade to a 8/10 if there is anything updated to it. Meaning letting it be modable, new dungeons, new objectives, new modes perhaps. This is the launch I understand that. Which is why im not grading this game harshly. It has alot of pertential. It is fun  and challenging and has decent replayablity. Even after my first win, I want to play again and again. Not at all a bad game for only 2 dollars. Definitely worth a try."

,Recommended,545250,29838457,Posted: 10 February,all,LegitimatelyBored,Best game I have ever played. Physics are top notch. The movement is fantastic. The controls are 100% the best better than basically anything I have ever played. Camera was great definitely wasn't terrible and was as if you were controling your vision via Atari joystick controls. However the game does allow you to look down at your own breasts which gives it a solid 10 points. 10/10 Everything is♥♥♥♥♥♥but boobs amirite?
