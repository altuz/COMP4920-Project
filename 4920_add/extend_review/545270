,Recommended,545270,31639914,Posted: 8 May,all,Violent J.D.,"The game is fantastic, only gripe is not telling you what the ""perfect dunk"" is.. or perfect shot is for that matter. A mix on NBA JAM and Street which hits the feels being a former NBA Showtime tournament player. How is it a mix? Look down belowNBA JAM:-obvious 2v2 gameplay-High flying dunks- Shoving as an optionNBA Street: Actually gearing off into​ NBA Street HOMECOURT territory, the timing of your shots/dunks factor in of you getting extra points much like the double dunk mechanic.-Gamebreaker-esque meter.Arcade gaming is back. Time for the NullDC emulator to be on the shelf a little bit.EDIT: For perfect shots/dunks, looks like the peak of jumps. Isn't common either so far. Will update if anything happens.EDIT P2: Online is pretty solid. And you get points even when people rage quit (Street fighter 5 take notes) xD"

Play with your friend against two different players(4 players on 2x2 with a new ranking, specificied to this category).2. An option to invite friend and play online against him. Since you can't invite nobody, it's just random row.3. Regulate the match up online, sometimes it's laggy, we prefer to play against a better/worst player than one from a different region."

This is not backyard basketball where that game was mouse driven.I'm glad I had a logitech gamepad, things works awesome for this game. If you have a keyboard, you might have to reconfigure your keys.It's NBA Jam light! I like that it is 3D-ish, so you have better view of steals and blocks. Dunk timing is hard, but after 1 or 2 hours you'll get the hang of it.I have not played online yet, but the AI is decent, so solo play is fun.It's an arcade game, and I can see myself playing this after a long day of work for ridiculous dunks.Note you do not get all the players, you unwrap them as you play. You'll get two/three legendary players, and then some current players."

So if you saw earlier reviews that weren't good and you didn't really want to buy it anymore then re-think your decision as this game has got 100X better"
,Not Recommended,545270,35025027,Posted: 17 September,all,Gordon Childe,"Once the game was released,it was real fun experience and had a lot of potential,even tho shooters were super unbalanced and having Ray Allen meant winning the game,it was still enjoyable.Unfortunately devs just kept ruining the game with every new update being worse than the latter one.Adding the shot meter killed the fun in 3pt shooting.After so much hype during the first days of the game,Game is pretty much empty in EU."
,Recommended,545270,31694579,Posted: 11 May,all,MeanMugginMo,This game is fun and I enjoy it but you can't really play with friends because there is no invite option and the matchmaking is random  so it's challenging for you to find them. This game would be 100x better if there were different modes such as 4v4s with 2 people on each team or 1v1s and custom lobbies where you could invite friends. I still would recommend this game to others due to the fact of how smooth and fun the game is.

,Recommended,545270,31640909,Posted: 8 May,all,TryZen,"Amazing!  Insanely fun!  Heavily inspired by NBA Jam, Street, the best part of ""Ultimate Teams/myTeam"", and maybe even a dash of Street Fighter.  Flavours that blend seemlessly into one of the best arcade sports game in recent memory.  Utilizing the NBA license nearly perfectly with a roster of 150 current and retired legends combined(Kobe/Jordan noteably excluded).  Also noteably excluded is microtransactions!  While characters are unlocked individually, finishing the game's ""Tournament Mode""(Single Player)  will give you an ample supply of Legends and Stars.Playing on a gamepad is recommended.  While I've personally encountered odd bugs.  The game itself is actually very entertaining and enjoyable!  Saber have plans to implement new modes and players.  Easily worth the price tag if you're looking for a couch co-op or arcade sports game!"

I never got to play the original NBA Jam but I did play the NBA Jam on Fire Edition a while back and I loved it.I can say for sure that if you liked either of those versions of NBA Jam that you will not be disappointed by NBA Playgrounds. There are tons of cards to unlock, an individual player level system, and (my favorite) the tournament mode where you go to different locations around the world to play 4 games against AI teams.Also this entire review is based off of me playing with a controller, so I do not know how the keyboard controls hold up.I will definitely update this review when I have more hours into this game because I feel like I could be playing this for a good amount of time!"
76561198109621232,Recommended,545270,32117346,Posted: 1 June,all,andrew2K14,"On the positive side this game is a modern update to classics like NBA Hangtime & NBA Jam Tournament Edition.However, a few key areas of game play make this quite frustrating to have a ""flow"" to the game.Suggestions below can be improved upon and hopefully made better in the next patches.1) Rebounding. The rebounding/box out is seemingly random or heavily favored to the AI for offensive rebounds. At least 5 times to ten times a game in three minutes both my player and CPU player are standing over a basketball on the ground and cannot pick it up while the AI opponent casually walks over and grabs the ball. This is very frustrating over 3 minutes of play.2) Cross-over dribbling. While excellent, they wipe out 1/2 or more stamina even on players with a high stamina rating. This would never happen in most arcade games so I hope this can be adjusted to allow for multiple cross overs or an option for unlimited.3) Fade away jumpers. The difficulty in converting a fade away jump shot is almost impossible. I have played as ""legend"" Tracy McGrady and his shot bar for success on a fade away jump shot is so small and such a difficult narrow window to press shoot that is becomes almost useless to attempt a fade away.4) Online play. I agree experience points are useful before online play. However, my first opponent played with a team containing Paul George and blocked my shot 10 times and scored at least five three pointers and was next to unguardable. Even Alonzo Mourning could not block dunks in the paint.5) Clear outs / steal attempts. Same frustrating challenge as cross-over dribbling. One steal attempt or push attempt should not clear out over 33% of stamina. I understand this is not an unlimited turbo game with unlimited pushing and am not asking for that. I think three push attempts per 100% stamina is not too much to ask here is it? There seems to be overcompensation for foulless games and like the game NBA Showtime: NBA ON NBC on Nintendo 64.  At least consider an ""arcade"" mode and simulation mode if that is the key. I thought this game was more ""arcade"" but it seems to hold onto a bit too much ""simulation"" in games.Considering I have 3 hours of gameplay it very well could be that I need to play another 15-20 hours to get my experience points up to increase stamina but it seems unlikely.Graphics are pretty nice (GTX 970, 16GB RAM, I7 3.4 GHZ Intel Processor, 1TB HDD).The player cards are fun and I like the random aspect of obtaining ""average"" to ""legend"" players in the player packs."

,Recommended,545270,31695901,Posted: 11 May,all,Vision,"I bought this game looking for something to play for 2 hours and then be done with it, but little did I expect to get a full day worth of enjoyment. NBA Playgrounds is a switch on those classic NBA Jam & NBA Street games. It is much more fast paced and fluent than those past games. You Start the game with a handful of ""Player Packs"" in order to get your dynamic duo of a team started. I really enjoy the Pack System in this game because it gave me some incentive to want to level up. I have played past NBA 2K games (2K10-2K17) and I feel as though that2K can learn something from Saber Interactive.The soundtrack and art style of this game is phenomenal and it only add's to the games zaniness and laid back attitude. NBA Playgrounds doesn't take itself too seriously, which is something I am in love with. Allen Iverson teaming throwing a 20-foot high alley-oop to Demar Derozan while dabbing is something I can highly appreciate and watch all day. There are over 150+ players for you to collect through player packs with NO MICROTRANSACTIONS, yes that means that you will have to actually play the game and gain some knowledge and skill in order to get some of the best players (Take a hint 2K). Some issues I have with the game are the Lottery Pick system and the game's content going forward. I feel as though the Lottery Pick system is a bit too RNG based for this game, I feel as though maybe if it wasn't earned as easy it would be more balanced. As for the long term, I hope they do not mess up the system of which they have already. I do hope they release more packs and tournaments throughout the updates but please DO NOT MAKE THEM BUYABLE. One of my favorite things about this game is how satisfying it is to unlock your favorite character after an hour or so of leveling and I feel as though putting in any sort of microtransactions would solely kill that feeling altogether. All together NBA Playgrounds is a fantastic game with some very minor tweaks. NBA fan or not, this is a definite pickup for anybody looking for some crazy fun.====================================================================================**EDIT AFTER WRITING**I totally forgot about the online portion of this game when writing my initial review, so let me address that here. The online portion is very fun... when it decides to work. I love seeing all of the combinations of players other players put together and it makes for some very interesting games. However most of the time I find myself lagging majorly or losing connection midway through a game. It seems as though multiple people are currently having this problem, so as the game is updated more you can most likely expect this problem to be fixed.====================================================================================PROS:-Very fast and fluent gameplay-Art Style and Soundtrack are very fitting-Loads of replay ability-Tournament Mode-Pack System-No Microtransactions-In-depth Player Information====================================================================================CONS:-Lottery Pick System-Online Servers-Longterm?"

,Not Recommended,545270,31812212,Posted: 17 May,all,Straight_Miz,The Gameplay is fun but i ended up refunding it. The Shop Site says 2v2 and Multiplayer (Online). In reality youre playing a 1v1 (the second of every team is AL and you can switch). That doesnt sound right. You also cant play with or against Friends. The playerbase is really small and i dont know how long they will last. But for someone who wanted to play 2vs2 witha  friend against 2 randoms its not worth 20 Euro.

There are so many times where I'm right under the ball after it bounces off the rim, I jump up to rebound it, and my player just jumps up beside it and never grabs the ball. They need to make it where your player jumps towards the ball like they actually want to rebound it.Other than that, I'm having a ton of fun with it! Definitely taking me back to my snes, sega, and n64 days of nba jam."

,Recommended,545270,31735223,Posted: 13 May,all,ChimeraGryph,"I've enjoyed a good amount of this game considering I wouldn't have put in the hours I did unless I had some degree of enjoyment. However, even with 2 updates there are still some issues1) FIX THE NETCODE: The first online match I had was laggy so much that I was dunked on when I had the ball. Then Whenever I was going to shoot a 3 pointer, I had the ball stolen from me out of nowhere.2) Repeat cards on maxed out players: If I take the time to grind out a player that has terrible stats, I don't want to see them come into a player pack because the exp they get is WORTHLESS. There are mobile games that understand duplicates on maxed out characters shouldn't exist and those are free to play.3) The lottery tickets punish people for winning too much: If I am winning by 9 points, this gives the enemy team something like double points or the mystery stars and on higher difficulty AI, they couldn't be anywhere near it and still win. This disincentivizes me from playing how I want to play and if I am 7 points ahead, then I just am throwing the ball around before they inevitably get a 3 pointer perfect shot. Making it to where that 7 point lead is now a 3 point lead all because I don't want them scoring 20 points from some bogus scoring mechanic. There needs to be a cutoff on it to where it's not becoming a deliberate losing is winning like Mario Kart.4) Perfect shots make zero sense without any given context: I don't know if it's asking for me to hit the very beginning, center, or the very end. If the game would clarify, that'd be great.5) The tutorial doesn't cover enough: I don't know when I should be pressing the steal button or when they are open to be stolen from and it results in braindead mashing of it. There isn't anything on blocking shots or when those windows are covered leading me to either shove or steal instead because those don't have as large of recovery.6) The AI became unforgiving around level 29. I will set the difficulty on easy and have the enemy AI with characters that have 3s and 4s for blocks come out to be able to block every single dunk am7) Shuffling has no counters: I've had so many AI matches where they just spammed the passing and shuffling towards the basket and that's how they score. Blocking has already been shown as ineffective without any showing as to why it didn't work. The passing spam can't be blocked by the steal button or the y button. Then, shoving becomes useless because they receive it and shuffle, now I have no stamina, they can sprint and dunk and fill lottery meter.8) Speaking of shoving: Shoving has more times than not only delayed them from scoring. I would shove them and the same player I shoved got the ball back. This means the shove button has more recovery than the person being shoved in a lot of cases. Then what was the point in shoving them?9) WHY DOES AN OFFLINE MODE LIKE EXHIBITION REQUIRE AN INTERNET CONNECTION? I had a few internet outages yesterday and not being able to play offline is a glaring issue that I don't understand. If they are that concerned with people cheating the card packs then require an internet connection to open them. If you don't want them scumming the exp, then why not turn off exp in offline if they are that concerned?10) Online mode is only against randos: It's 2017, people played NBA Jam with their friends back in 1993 locally and in 2010 there was a game in which you could play with friends online in 2010. This is a game people want to play with friends and some friends are half the country away. Get with the picture.11) Character Balancing: It isn't a fair game when someone is using 2 legendaries against 2 commons. This is just screaming for people to meta-♥♥♥♥♥ and all you are going to see are the 2 same players over and over again. Have a character level limit which forbids legendaries from going against commons, epics against commons, or legendaries against commons.All of that being said this game is good. It's a good game to pick up and play for 30 minutes, but after that, it can become repetitive."

Although they should have went that route, this game is fantastic) and you get packs. 2v2, there's a single player campaign and online mode. You have online MMR as well, the more wins the higher the division you get in.Issues: Menus take a while to get into, for instance if I wanted to check out my player stats it takes a little too long to load the team page and then the player page. They need to optimize and speed that up a bit. They also should make it more clear what powerups do or have a mini wiki or something in the menus to show that (maybe I missed it).Game overall is fun and it makes me smile and laugh aloud everytime I attempt to get a dunk or get dunked on or do something silly. Pure bliss, brings back NBA Street Vol. 2 feel with NBA Jam (the newer one, not the older one) look/style."

The tutorial really does not teach you how to play, it tells you the controls but you have to get a feel for shooting on your own.- Always online. You cant play this game at all if you arent connected to the internet.- Optimization on PC isn't /great/, It works, it plays, it doesnt seem to drop frames, but the game has crashed so many times for me. Also the volume settings straight up dont work.Overall:I would recommend this game to people who liked NBA Jam and don't mind spending a LOT of time to unlock the players you actually want to use, but if you just want to jump in and play a casual game this might not be what you are looking for. The game looks easy enough, but the shot timings and mechanics take time to master, so it can be a bit frustrating at first.

,Recommended,545270,31656380,Posted: 9 May,all,SweeTARTS Candy®,"IN-DEPTH REVIEW. As someone who grew up playing thousands of hours of NBA JAM and NBA JAM Tournament Edition, I want to write this review for those familiar with NBA JAM (simplified sports games) and those not familiar with these games. I'll try to explain both_____________________This game in my mind is a cross between NBA Jam and Freestyle Basketball 2.It is a 2v2 basketball game that is highly dependent on a) Timing b) momentum management c) character matchups.This game is similar to NBA Jam (hereafter referred to as NBAJ) in that it is a 2v2 basketball game with sprint/boost, shoves, elbow throws, super flying dunks, power ups. Its dunks, blocks, steals, shooting and defense are all VERY TIMING based. Just like NBAJ. But the timing is even more strict and takes awhile to learn, unlike NBAJ.It also has important character stats like shooting, dunking, 2 pointers, 3 pointers, steals, blocks, stamina, speed, rebounding. Keep in mind 2 pointers and dunks are different things. Basically each of these have their own timing window and better ratings allow you more forgiving timing window.This game is different from NBAJ in thatmomentum managementis hugely important. This is similar to Freestyle basketball 2. Basically, the way you open the defense up is by getting them to jump on your pump fake or be too aggressive on defense. Doing so will pigeonhole the defender into a certain type of defense, which u can exploit.As an example, if you receive a pass, you pump fake and the defender jumps super high to block. You then move slightly over and shoot a free 3 pointer. Or you receive the pass and defender tries to steal, in which case you throw elbows and knock him back. It's basically a counter-counter mind game.NBAJ had some of this but you could recover on defense much faster because there wasn't really momentum applied to the characters besides jumping. Here, even a bad steal attempt and especially a bad shove attempt puts you out of position on defense.Other features to consider:Stamina -So there was a turbo meter in NBAJ but in this game you need to learn to defend well without relying on steal/shove. You need to learn timings and positioning. A shove attempt completely depletes your stamina and it's hard to land. A steal attempt takes less stamina but about 3 attempts completely depletes you. This is even if you never sprint on defense, which you will.This is because the offense has a juke move on Right stick, another major difference from NBAJ. I actually like this change because people and PGs who are great at steals can MURDER you in NBAJ and games like this. Juking does take about half your stamina though, but it gives u a slight boost downcourt as well. Dunking also takes a lot of stamina and if you don't have any you will do a layup instead.Timing -Dunking and shooting timings are very strict and hard to learn at first. If you miss, it will tell you ""early"" or ""late"". It's tough but you will learn it eventually. It may be offputting to younger gamers, but this type of ""just play until you learn it"" mechanic is totally normal if you grew up playing Super NES or Sega genesis.Defense -As I mentioned before it's hard. You may feel just go offense and outscore your opponent. But if you DO have a solid defense, you can just destroy your opponent. The game is very snowball due to power ups I mention below.You cannot goal tend like you could in NBAJ. Well, in NBAJ you could basically catch the ball out of the air by lining up with it on its way up (and slightly on its way down even). In this game you need to play close defense and time your jump to block their shots. Great blockers will jump SUPER high to block a jump shot.For blocking dunks it's more about jumping WITH the dunker and matching his momentum. If you do, you will basically collide in the air with him and knock out the ballOn Fire system -There is no on fire system like NBAJ. But there is a power up system. If you fill a certain power bar, you get a random mario kart like powerup (infinite stamina, guaranteed 3 pointer, etc). To fill the bar you must perform well, and if your opponent dunks on your face it can lower your bar.So, this is very much a rich-get-richer type of system. Not sure how I feel about that, I feel they should be exclusive of each other OR actually help the loser catchup.Characters -Thank god there's no micro$ in this game to get characters. But you will have to play and ""level up"" to get player packs and unlock players. I'm guessing that you eventually get every player in game just by playing. That is good.You need to find your playstyle and what characters you want to use. Right now, it's pretty much all Shaq and Curry. But player matchups are definitely a thing._____Needs fixing- Audio bug. Cannot save music level and it's loud- If you receive a pass and throw elbows, you cannot dribble after, which is wrong basketball-wise. You can catch and pump fake then dribble, which is correct. But an arm movement doesn't preclude you from starting a dribble. This should be fixed.- multiplayer. I personally can't find any match. I've changed my Steam Download region to Asia, US-Los Angeles, New York and London. Found one match. So I'm guessing mp is broken pretty much. I just queued for 25 min on US-LA region while writing this review.Also keep in mindThere is no 2v2 right now. And there is no friend invites. The only mp is playing random 1v1 online. If you want this to play with friends, I recommend to WAIT and DO NOT BUY- FPS lock. It's locked to 60 fps. Would be nice to have 144 fps but I'm guessing this won't happen[h] Conclusion [/h]I do recommend this given you understand all the above and like these mechanics. However, if you want a more relaxing or forgiving sports game, it may not be for you.I also forsee a ""meta"" unfortunately forming based on certain things (namely dunking into alley oop pass and dunk) being incredibly efficient in terms of success rate. There needs to be dunking teams, 2 pointer teams, 3 pointer teams, and defensive / rebounding teams viable.But I do now know if the devs have the means or will to make this competitively balanced. This is a 20$ game after all. We will see.Feel free to comment on this review if you have questions. I'm very passionate about sports games like this and Super Mega Baseball and Rocket League ."

,Not Recommended,545270,33086132,Posted: 1 July,all,MattyRasker,"I bought this because I played NBA Jam back on the Mega Drive, and having recently played NBA Jam On Fire Edition round a friends house, this looked very similar to that and thought I'd give this a go.In the 15 minutes I played with my son, it does indeed play very similar to NBA Jam On Fire Edition. It's smooth and it plays very well. The mechanics seemed OK and overall we were having fun.Unfortunately, I'm gutted to say I'm going to have to request a refund. Reason - my son and I were played an offline Exhibition match vs AI, and it was interrupted near the end by the game suddenly going back to the main menu, with a ""Lost Connection to the server"" error message. Whether its a temporary loss of connection on my side or their side matters not, but if this kind of thing irritates you as much as it irritates me then I do not recommend purchasing this game.However, if this kind of thing doesn't bother you then go for it - from what I played it seems like a perfectly acceptable game.But I'm personally not going to recommend it, on the basis that it appears that the game wants you to be online even if playing locally or single player, and if it loses connection to the internet, that's your game over."

This game is a fun arcade like game, and while I don't like the level of grind at times at least you're not paying 100s for just one legend that will be reset in a couple months.Problem I have is mainly with the online. The fastest way to get exp after finishing all the tournaments the meta seems to be shoves and threes. The developers claim not to want a dominant strategy yet why are the players in the gold + tier in online all they do is shove as soon as you touch the ball. Can't even shoot, shoved, pass? Guy already shoved to the ground. Then when they have dominant three point shooters they take one step into the halfcourt, three. Rinse repeat. My biggest suggestion would be like a shove limit, if you hit the limit you give up a lottery pick or something every foul.Edit:After an update they nerfed the shove move which I like. The rebounding is still broken but there's at least some progress to fix it. Main thing they have to add is the multiplayer coop, I could recommend this after that."

The player caricatures are hilarious.Its overall gameplay is decent. At the time of writing this review, it is a fun arcade game.While the game requires you to unlock all players, you can do this through playing the game instead of having to buy random packs. There are no players that are extremely rare or expensive to get and a reasonable fee unlocks them all if that is what you want.Upgrading players goes fast and unlocks cosmetic changes. The stats stay the same.Negatives:The person who did the stats for the players made some ridiculous decisions. Tracy McGrady, Dr. J, Zack LaVine, Gerald Green, Shawn Kemp might be some of the best dunkers of all time but in this game none of them are 10s. Ben Wallace is an average rebounder, and Roy Hibbert is a better shot blocker than Wilt Chamberlain. Celtics' Shaq is one of the best 2PT scorers in the game, Ricky Rubio is a 10 for steals, Roy Hibbert is one of the best defensive big men, Tony Parker is a 9 on threes, and the Celtics' Ray Allen is a better dunker than the Bucks' Ray Allen. Kevin Durant is an average shooter and LeBron is just a dunker; don't expect him to be good at defense or rebounding. Why they could not just make the great players great is beyond me. You don't play this kind a game to have your favorite player be a scrub (or simply play like someone else). Just hand out more 10s and make some players (like Wilt and LeBron) truly dominant across the board.Nobody seems to be playing this online at the time. It is still very fun to play with your friends in coop.The game's stamina feature could use an update. Instead of not letting me do a defensive move when I am out of stamina, it would be better if the effectiveness would just go down.The dribble moves have no real function, at least not against the CPU.Neutral:3PT shooting is overpowered. You can defeat the computer with Ray Allen or Dirk Nowitzki by shooting threes and not running back on defense. I won a tournament finals game 45-20 by doing that. I don't think that the 3PT shooting effectiveness should be taken down though. However, this issue goes away when playing real players so I do not feel that this should be changed.Some other reviews complain about RNG. Sports games often have RNG as it feels more realistic. There is a very small percentage chance that a perfect shot will go out, and honestly, that is fine with me. You can shoot a basketball with perfect mechanics and still miss."

,Not Recommended,545270,32708552,Posted: 23 June,all,Pendulous,"I was hoping for a nice updated version of NBA Hangtime. What I got was a frustrating mix of things on top of some good ideas.The card/pack system to unlock players is a good idea. However, it takes WAY too long to earn enough XP to get just one pack, which is just random players (and I'm guessing other things like different parks, which makes it even worse). XP per level has fluctuated, and I don't understand why.Leveling specific players is also cool, but again, it takes way too long. Especially considering how many players there are. Plus, from what I can tell, the only thing you get for leveling is new moves, which don't actually improve anything.Gameplay:The shot meter is a terrible idea, as it forces you to look away from the action. Not only that, it's really bothersome to have layups and dunks constantly missing, even when uncontested. Even with the meter in the green, they miss. Those are 99% accuracy shots, but my percentage is way below that. It's impossible to make shots with any kind of consistency. Turn off the shot meter and you literally can't make anything. Older games just suggested you release the shot at the height of your jump, and used that plus the players own stats to determine how accurate the shot is. Forcing us to look away from high-action is not a good idea.The A.I. in this game is absurd. Even on rookie difficulty, it's hard as balls. The opponents block every shot, knock you out on every dunk, contest everything.Inputs don't work. Telling your teammate to go up for an alley-oop works very rarely. Pushing is bugged, it works when it wants to.Even though the opponent A.I. is so smart, your teammate is dumb as a rock and will mostly just stand there. You can't have it both ways.The shot clock is random. I don't know if it's a feature or bug that the time on the shot clock doesn't always reset, but it's absolutely stupid either way. Also add to this getting more points for doing certain things, that aren't well explained.Stealing is pointless. Nine times out of ten, if you swipe the ball out of their hands, it will end up right back in their hands. Same with pushing them, forcing the ball out.I can't recommend this game as is, but it has potential to be a great successor to NBA Jam/Hangtime."

My issue is gameplay. I have been playing nba games since the 90's, and using the controller is just terrible and destroys game play.- Stealing the ball slaps it away, but basically allows the offensive player to recover it first, unless your the AI.- Jumping for a rebound is absolutely useless, as I have yet to be able to grab a ball in the air without it hitting the ground.- blocking a shot in the air is useless due to the fact that the controller if in middle position will jump away from the rim and player, and technically it is very random when you can block in position, as different controller positions don't neccessarily put you in the right space. For instance if I need to block through the middle, pushing the controller stick to the middle doesn't make your player jump towards the middle a good portion of the time.- driving the lane is extremely frustrating as you perform a layup, and the release point is way off. So I tried watching the indicator to ensure I hit within the green, and easy layups again were missed.- three point shot is not balanced with a timed release either. It is not hitting the apex of the shooters shot, so watching a player to establish a rhythm of release just isn't possible.At this point, I am still fairly new and will give it a chance as I like the overall concept, and I will update if I have made mistakes in my argument. But for now it is a very frustrating game, and may end up in the delete pile."

Yes, it adds the friend invite feature that really should have been in at launch, but for me the biggest improvement is in the shooting mechanics. Now, it's actually easier to score a 2-pointer than a three, and instead of blindly guessing when to release the ball, they've added a shot-meter to show you. Steals are easier, too, which just makes each game all that more entertaining. [Edit: Patch 1.1.2 made steals hard again :( ]NBA Playgrounds is much closer now to the game I was hoping it would be, and I've got to give kudos to the devs for their support in the discussion forum and the speed with which they've put out these updates.I still think it could do with a practice mode, but otherwise NBA Playgrounds is a really fun game and I absolutely recommend it."

76561198025003337,Not Recommended,545270,31811628,Posted: 17 May,all,Laveron,"I want to like this game.  I really, really want to like this game.When I initially started playing, I was having a lot of fun playing against the CPU.  Learning how to play the game, trying to figure out the timing of shots, and playing through the tournaments.  However, I knew that this fun would not last forever, as the real crux of these kind of games is the multiplayer.  So I finally jumped on to play some online games and what do I get?  Probably one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had playing a basketball game.I played multiple matches, and it all boiled down to this:  The opposing team would send their Steph Curry to the opposite side of the cart, wait for the clock to run down, and shoot from 90 feet away.  They'd make it about 25% of the time, which is already a big giant red flag for me.Okay, you'll say, but if that's all he's shooting you can easily outscore them.  That would work, except that rebounding is inherently broken.  If you don't control the rebounder, your teammate's AI decides to run out to the three point line to contest the shot, then realize they can't and run back under the basket which is always later than the opposing player's AI.  If you ARE controlling the rebounder, you can expect the AI to never play defense on the other side of the court, and grabbing a rebound is incredibly frustrating.  It's impossible to jump and grab a rebound, because your player will just go flying into the air towards god knows where.  You have to walk towards where the ball is going to be which, again, wouldn't be an issue if the opposing player's AI didn't somehow magically know where the ball was going to bounce and get to it before you.Even with Dwight Howard, I'd be standing directly underneath where the ball was going to land and the opposing team's Steph Curry would casually walk over and go into what I call the rebounding animation of stupidity.  The game decides who's going to get the ball before the ball is grabbed. That player will then look upwards and very, very slowly walk towards the ball.  It doesn't matter if somebody else gets to the position before that player since that player has already been prematurely chosen as the rebounder.Then there's the shooting.  I had to go online and do research on what the shot timing is supposed to be.  I've played basketball games all my life from NBA Jam to 2k17, and I've never had an issue with shot release timing.  In this game, it seems the shot release has nothing to do with your actual player's animation.  It's much easier to stand in the corner and shoot a three than it is to try and time a layup in this game, which is ridiculous.Then there's the powerups.  A fun but gamebreaking (see what I did there) addition to the NBA Street games, in Playgrounds the powerups are not created equal and can therefore single handedly win a team a game.  Oh look, I got the powerup that allows me to score a shot with 100% accuracy.  The opponent gets the powerup that doubles their dunk points... and it lasts multiple possessions.  Takes a lot of the skill out of the game.Finally there's the stealing.  It happens in about 50% of the games.  The opposing team will be about five feet away from me, mash the steal button, and knock the ball away 100% of the time.  I mean it.  Literally 100% of the time steal mashing would work for those players.Again, I would absolutely love to be able to enjoy this game, but with online broken like it is I just can't see myself playing it again any time soon.  Because of that, I'll be asking for a refund.tl;dr:  Fun concept, but the online is broken in incredibly frustrating ways.  Would not recommend."

Bad control system, sluggish movement, and no clue where the ball is on rebounds are just some of the issues. The only NBA Jam aspect they managed to copy is when the CPU plays catch up, and forces you to miss dunks, but lets the CPU get 3 points seemingly at will. Very little to offer in the single player mode, the same with online. My first (and only) online game, the opponent had 2 legendary players, and dropped 3 points every time. Fantastic idea, but alas a missed opportunity. Avoid this if you're looking for nostalgia."

It is impossible to tell on some fancy layups whether it is the end of the shot or if it is the beginning. It really destroys the timing and I can't get it down after a few tries. Defense is ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious, can't stay in front of anyone and people like Damian Lillard are dunking all over Joel Embiid who has a 10/10 block. The timing is the worst part though, there's no way to tell when a press of the button was too hard, because it always feels the same. I just want a goddamn way to tell when to release the ball, I've gotten threes down because the timing isn't hard, but the amount of times I've blown a wide open dunk because it was early or late is too high. Please change it, it really makes the game no fun for me."

The number of players online seems to be lackluster given the seemingly lengthy queue times. Most of the people you'll face have mastered the art of perfect shots, well-timed steals, and aggresive play. You'll need to have some patience in order to learn the tricks for yourself.This game brings local multiplayer and co-op, however. If you're looking for a goofy arcade-style time killer, this is a good way to spend time with friends at home.I'd avoid buying this game if you're like me and looking for something to play solo while you're looking to relax or your friends are offline. I don't plan on spending my time competing on the leaderboards for this game as there are many other games I'll play for that experience instead. The offline content is predictable and easily mastered, especially as you collect Legend player cards and take the very small amount of time to get them to Gold.I would purchase reasonably-priced DLC if it offered offline career, team manager, or randomized tournament modes. In a career mode, I'd like to tie myself to a non-Epic/Legend player and progress only controlling them. In a team manager role, I'd like to be able to utilize my entire card collection to simulate the best pairs to play season matches while balancing leveling cards. Finally, in an improved tournament mode I'd like to see 32 or 64-team brackets with randomized pairs that I could compete my way to the top."

There are just too many experience killing game mechanics at the moment.  The OP nature of elbows/steals is ridiculous.  The long pause after each made basket is a complete buzzkill.  The changing position of the clock/shot clock for each court plus having the clock be a stationary object rendered by the game engine seems nice in theory, but makes it difficult to quickly see how much time you have left to shoot as you're searching around for it mid-game.  The shot animations make it easier to hit a perfect 3-pointer than to hit a perfect layup/dunk.  I refunded the game, but would definitely repurchase it if at least some of these major issues were resolved."

The game mechanics don't make sense.Simple summary, started a game with Jason Kidd with the ball, Patrick Ewing steals it off me at half court, I can't steal it back, the Robert Parish hits a perfect dunk from the 3 point line. Sure...Another game has Russel Westbrook standing over the ball like a rugby hooker, which I'm unable to get to until he decides he is going to pick it up. Later that game he and his team mate keep clipping through me under the basket because they were in a crossover animation?The ratings don't seem to matter, the shooting mechanics are broken, there is no goaltending and the commentary is unbearable and personal!?This game feals like a soulless version of the epic NBA Jam On Fire Edition.At this stage I'd recommend saving your money."

Steals and blocks are near impossible and it seems like the defense stats don't mean anything.

Its practically a smartphone rpg gimmick to keep the replay value high for single player and add some level balanceing for the online mode.NBA Jammers save your money.
