It trys really hard to be scary bit it just fails.Here is one problem. the flashlight is WAY to dim. and the graphics are honestly bad.I personally give it a 1/10. and if you are reading this. don't take offense and try to better yourself at what you do.

I don't know if anyone else is having that issue but I managed to get to the next room by jumping over some geometry outside the map. I've had more fun stomping in puddles of dog♥♥♥♥♥♥The assets in this game have no artistic cohesion so say goodbye to immersion. There's no music. It's only about 10 minutes long. The developer clearly didn't give a damn when they made this game so you shouldn't either. Don't bother with it.If you're still thinking ""well surely it's got that jank we all love"" then here's a video to dissuade you.https://youtu.be/i5ogSHfT0TE"

,Not Recommended,545280,32365571,Posted: 12 June,all,Tree.,"It only costs 0,99€, but still isn't worth the money.- no story (except for the store description)- ultra bad graphics- bad level design (You can just run out of the map at your starting point. It's hard to NOT see that this is possible.)- everything looks the same- the whole game had something like 4,5 or 6 enemies, two different types (one appears only once and can't move)- there's one single gun, which has no crosshair, is barely controllable and looks bad- most of the doors and the elevator don't have sounds- the level which should be dark was completly white and bright as I played it, not like it's shown in the trailer- Why does this game even exist?Ending screen read ""To be continued""... PLEASE no."
76561198138643048,Not Recommended,545280,31496636,Posted: 1 May,all,Mountain Dewey,"Jesus Christ, this game is awful.The game has no story, so you're just dropped off in a abandoned subway system in the start of the game, where you have to look for a key. But this game is so awfully made that in order to find the key, you have to get out of the map and crawl under the floating room. (They played this before releasing it, right?)In the second stage, it's not worth looking for the first key, because the fence is so low you can get in and out of the room by jumping onto a thing.In the third stage, you run into the enemies. However, since the developers obviously spend 20 minutes designing this game, there's only two enemies you can fight, and one of them appears only once! Also, there's a glitch where if you kill an enemy as he's playing a sound effect, it won't stop for the REST OF THE GAME. This gets very annoying as the rest of the game is just going through a maze-like space ship thing. You also find a gun, but unfortunatly it's one of the worst video game guns I have ever had the expirence using. You cannot tell where your bullets go, and to make matters worse, the gun shakes a bunch, making it even harder to hit shots. And don't get hit, because if you do, the sound of your heart beating will NOT STOP until you find a health kit, or food that's obviously gone bad. Also, you can have over 100 health, even though the health bar shows 100 | 100. This stage is also super repetitive, too. Go through a few rooms, kill an enemy, find ammo and flip a switch.The game finally ends when you find a door that takes you outside, where the screen fails to fade to black and says ""To be continued...""This game is a complete joke. I finished this in less than 25 minutes, and about a third of that was waiting for the painfully slow loading screens to go by. There's no music, either, making the game abnormally quiet. Please, do not get this game. Save your money for Half life, a much better game that was released 17 years before this absolute joke."

76561198019216815,Not Recommended,545280,30512180,Posted: 14 March,all,Crebmen,"The face of hope: Underground (yes, it's uncapitalized like that) is a horror-ish FPS that should not be purchased under any circumstances.Simply put, there is no rhyme or reason to the level design, it feels like the developer had a bunch of assets kicking around that they decided to staple together and sell on Steam for a quick buck.An underground subway train-station will lead into a mine, which then leads into a science lab, which then leads into a room with a big hedge-maze because why not?Like, you even find holes and gaps in the level assets where they weren't lined up properly or blocked off (the very first room in the game has tunnel sections that lead out of bounds).Again, clearly an asset flip made for steam cards, don't bother with it.PROS:- It has cards.- Cost me $0.50CONS:- No music- Poor sound-design.- Ugly graphics and incohesive environments.- Clearly an asset flip with little-to-no effort concealing that fact.- Flash-light is horrible.- Runs at a solid 10-20 frames per second.- Models pop in and out at random, sometimes they won't properly render in at all.- Game ends on a cheap ""TO BE CONTINUED?"" after only 30 minutes of gameplay.SCORE: 1/10Who thought it'd a good idea to put a hedge-maze in a secret lab?"
,Not Recommended,545280,28437654,"Posted: 17 December, 2016",all,TwiggyTheTree,"So, about this game. It is more or less broken. It WILL crash from time to time, the sound will randomly cut out and will most of the time, if at all, be so loud that you will jump five feet in the air. The gunplay is bad beyond belief and will sometimes fire on its own for no reason. The graphics look like something taken right from the ps 1 era aswell. The level designe is odd and random. Did I mention one whole part of the map is missing so you have to fumble around in oblivion before finding the right way? Do not buy this game unless you are into bad ""horror"" games."

Where do I even begin?I paid literally what,  30 something cents,  and I still feel like I could've spent it better.Do not buy this game.

,Not Recommended,545280,33597559,Posted: 16 July,all,seraphim_fallen,"Well... I understand that it's a work in progress. That being said, I couldn't find the key in the begining, and crawled under the ""floating building"" outside to advance. Its an FPS, but has less than 15 enemies. The constant searching for keys everywhere is like Slender on drugs, it's just too much. Basically, its like playing a G-Mod horror map. If you're into that, its an ok game. Very short, even with having to give up and cheat the first level it took less than an hour to complete. Also, the graphics look like shutterstock photos posted and reposted on top of each other. Keep working, it may turn out to be an interesting adventure, but right now; it needs a lot of work."
