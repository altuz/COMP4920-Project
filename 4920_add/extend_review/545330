If you haven't played Recettear, it's a superior experience for just $5 more. Al Fine involves too much clicking and not enough thinking.The market you buy your items from has infinite stock and their prices rarely change. Exploring dungeons consists of selecting an adventurer and waiting 3 days for the game to tell you whether he succeeded or failed. And selling your items basically consists of setting the same items out at default price 98% of the time and occasionally clicking their shelves to restock them. The biggest change of strategy is during one of the 4 Commerce Battles in the game, where the easiest way to make a bigger income (not profit; spend as much money as you like) than your competitor is to sell all the expensive loot you've stored from the dungeons at a 10-20% discount.It feels like they cut a lot of corners with this game: it only gives you information on the buying preferences of less than half of your customers, all of the information about the other stores in the Top 10 list (not to mention the Top 10 list itself) is worthless, and there's a persistent bug where after an hour or two of playing it, it'll start maxing out your VRAM and refuse to load textures (and also switch to Japanese).The story itself is too bland and light for its own good. All of the characters are caricatures that barely get any development and the only major conflict is a plot to monopolize the town's economy that only takes up 10 days of the 100-day duration. The other 90 days basically involve the meek main character deciding he wants to be a merchant and making friends to help him. Nothing is really done with the 3 different races or the floating island setting.It took me 14 hours to finish the game. I wish I hadn't invested that time (or my money) into it."

You can spend this time either opening shop, or choosing to visit one of the town's locations.- Locations are exactly same as Racettear - town center, market, pub, adventure and merchant guilds.  Access to each location are restricted by the time segment of the day (ie pub on accessible at night).- You obtain goods to sell by either buying from market, or obtaining through dungeons.  Unlike Racettear, there is no combat or RPG element.  You just hire the adventurer and send them off.  They'll return 3 days later and bring back loot.- You can upgrade and redesign your shop to change the mood and type of customers that visit shop.- Every 10 days you have to pay a fee to keep the store open.The differences- Weather and seasons.  These affect the number of customers but in reality the effect is only cosmetic.  Even on a bad weather day, with nothing else to do, you are still going to open the shop regardless, just means you make a little less profit that day.  It does not affect your decision making hence I describe it as cosmetic.- Commerce battles.  You have to make more profit than your rival within x days.  This is also cosmetic since you're still going to sell things and make profit anyway.  The battles dont change your course of normal actions.Poor implements:- cant change resolution.  there is no fullscreen option, so the game at 800x600 (i think?) is just a tiny window.- The game allows you to speed up time, but you have to manually restock shelves.  If you speed up time, by the time you notice the shelf is empty and click on the shelf to restock, the store is already closed.  So you can either watch the slow shopping process and be more efficient in restocking, or you can fast forward the boring parts but possibly miss out on sales.  I don't understand why restocking isnt an automated process.- unlike Racettear where all customer types will buy pretty much everything, but have individual preferences towards price of certain goods, Al Fine customers will only buy the items they are designed to buy.  It is not fun to see alot of customers walk in, look around and not like anything then walk back out and waste your time.I also encountered a game crashing bug where an error message popped up and said something like ""out of VRAM unable to load scene"".  Game does not autosave, and I lost all progress.Its another game where I wish there was a neutral button. I'll hit recommend but really Racettear is the same but much better."

It's cute, funny, and has some mechanics (food spoiling, for e.g) that give it an interesting take that make it different enough from Recettear. I'm only 2 hours in, and I can see myself playing this a lot."

For a game very similar to Recettear, if not a remake, I'd have thought the devs would let the players be able to skip something they already know in the least.  Pretty much spent the first half hour just reading what I already knew.To close out, the game is just missing the very basic features that would otherwise make me keep the game.Until then, I would keep that $15 for now, if I were you."
,Not Recommended,545330,26577983,"Posted: 13 November, 2016",all,General Accel,"tl;dr - I can't recommend this game at it's current price for the content it provides.It's like a more technical and casual form of Recettear. I would recommend trying Recettear first before trying this one out. The story is very similar to Recettear as well, both Main Characters start up their family shops to pay off a debt. It's still a fun little tycoon game.I would recommend getting the game when it's on sale and when the vram error issue is fixed, because it can ruin many in-game days of progress in an instant if you haven't saved before it just randomly happens. The vram error issue becomes more frequent the more I had progressed into the game making it almost unplayable.I played the game on Hard for a challenge and it wasn't an impossible task to get to day 99, except as for my first time there was no way in hell I was going to beat Ornate Brand with the RNG like buyers. I could be bad at the game and there is probably a how to guide, or not.Edit: 12/12/2016The game is still filled with bugs, like the game having all the UI Text turning back into japanese and the store missing textues so it's just a black void, but maybe someday the port will be fixed. Still no trading cards available and it would make this buy a bit better if there was."
,Recommended,545330,29354299,Posted: 19 January,all,Cid,"Video Review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f81rLNZ1rCkIn Summary: I really enjoyed the art and characters but sadly the gameplay isn't as deep as Recettear. I had fun with this but I do wonder if that was because I really wanted another shopkeeping game. The lack of graphical and sound options is big issue, particularly the sound as it is INCREDIBLY loud.I'm pretty lukewarm about this one but I'll give it a recommend because I didn't hate it.. However, I'd say only give this a shot if it's cheap or if you badly want a game like this."

,Recommended,545330,26595570,"Posted: 13 November, 2016",all,LinkTech,"Like many others said, if you have yet to play Recettear you're wasting your time here.If you have, here's a breakdown of what i've noticed so far and why I DO suggest the game.Pros-Engaging yet casual shop keeping, addicting and can be played with just the mouse (again, making it extremely casual while you chill.)Light but cute story, nowhere near as funny and quirky as Recettear but has its own charm to it.Has all the addictive shopkeeping pros of Recettear but more casual and mindless. Letting you set up the % you wish to sell your item for on the shelf instead of when the customer comes to the register. Meaning you can sell in bulk and kind of just zip through the shop process a little faster.Cons-No Config options? It only runs in a smaller window, which if you've played a lot of asian import games tend to be the norm for some.Does have a vRAM bug, after two hours of gaming it'll shut down on you. Just restart every hour or so and you'll be okay until they fix it.The dungeon system is indeed just a little fetch system where you set up an adventurer with gear and click a dungeon floor and then go about your shop as usual for 3 days until they return.Price? Would be easier to consider for its flaws if it was at the 10.00 mark. A good sale-game."

,Recommended,545330,26595822,"Posted: 13 November, 2016",all,Lemoniii,"Pros:→ features are refined.→ Easy to load up and play a day or two→ Cute store graphics→ auto save every in game day→ game starts very fast (requirements to play the game are pretty low)Cons:→ not a lot of features and gameplay. very simple mechanics, I think i would enjoy it more as a kid.→ Wish it has more aspects for dungeoning in the tower rather than just choose a tower level where they will go away for 3 days....→ Not entirely sure if its worth $16.99 CDN. Stardew valley has a lot more to do..→ minor bug every couple hours w/o restarting, not a big deal since it has auto save and the game starts quite fastI don't mind the error that pops up since its quick to close and reopen. It also has a auto save every in game day so you wouldn't lose much.You can do 3 things in a day. Two of the main activities is going to the market to buy stock to sell or going to your store to sell the items.The store itself is very cute but it is a bit too limited in terms of what you do inside. Basically, you setup what you want to sell and the price. Then you can change your 4 store decorations which also feel very liimited. Finally you open your store and sit and wait until the day is over. While the store is open, you can click on a shelf to make the sprit refill stock. In the store, there is one cashier(yourself) and a sprite that is VERY slow at refilling stock on the items you indicate. It isn't that big of an issue but does't feel fulfilling when it takes a couple hours in game time to refill one shelf...   If you don't open the store you can go to the market to buyPlot is light and cute, nothing dramatic nor emotional. I think this is more of a kid's game which I wouldn't mind getting if i had a kid since you can tech them economy.  Or if you want to learn supply and demand or any other merchant scenarios, this is pretty good for that :)Anyways,  I'm only 8 hours in, I have enjoyed it so far, but I feel like I'm already almost done the game? Not sure why but some 'parts' of the game feels like i've unlocked everything already? I'm hoping there is more content and gameplay so I can at least get another 10+ hours from this game. I'm at chapter 6... maybe I can google to see if anyone knows how many chapters there are... :P"

76561198101304105,Recommended,545330,26564917,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,blackageha,"In Short:An improvement of the business mechanics seen from Recettear.Long Ver:Recettear, a Japanese indie darling that focuses on being a merchant, years later we now find a very similar game inspired by Recettear.In Al Fine, you play as Loius, a young man swindled by a Sprite named Alice to pay back for breaking a supposingly precious 'gem'.But there is no giant debt hanging over our heads but in place are the guild taxes which occurs a few times per month and when there is a challenge, you have a few days to upped over your opponent's profits.The shop is affected by what types of customers which are affected by decorations, by weather (sunny, rainy, cloudy) affecting the numbers of customers, by type of items (food *rot by days*, equipment, merch) or by the usual...price.But within price, there are more restrictions as customer's budget are not affected by your rank like in Recettear (aka the level). Only by market trends will the price change, allowing you to sell more.While in the shop, using Alice you can restock items as long as you have it in the warehouse. Although, I have not found anything to improve her speed in the game so far (5 hours of playing).Improving the shop will cost you your merchant points that are gained via selling in the guild. I do find that its best to pile a few upgrades rather than 1 upgrade as 1 doesn't affect too much into the shop and you save time.Speaking of time, just like Recettear...you will pass the time by just visiting places. Some places will give you information to be used much later in the game.There is 1 huge con to this game, the inability to go into dungeons.You can hire an adventurer to do so but its just bassically assigning them away missions which success depends on their level and equipment.The game does not have any feature to change an adventurer's equipment so far...Another con would be the character design, the illustrator seems to lack basic anatomy lessons but in return makes it very detailed. There is just something annoying about their necks and collarbones...Interestingly there is actually another illustrator on this game as you can see on the merchants portraits via rank which are superbly better than the character designer (unless its somebody introduced in the game).Storywise, I do feel there is far more characterization with Alice than Louis...I can't really say anything more as I'm in Chapter 2. The game does not show anything on romance, only friendship.The music so far is pleasant and it works within the game. But is it memorable? No.Overall:If you're hungry for more selling mechanics aka Recettear, this might scratch that itch. I did enjoy the game with my 5 hours and it does have some difficulty to it to gain maximum profit within a short time. (The game does tell you whether you're good or terrible). There are more games inspired by Recettear but those games are sadly to be release so...so far away. It either 75 or 78/100 would be my rating.Currently: 29 hours = Finish. It might be shorter but I was trying to get rank 1 in the Merchant rankings. Its actually pretty easy to fall from rank 1 to rank 3 or 4 after just 1 day of terrible profits. Also found out that seasons also changes the trends of items so the difficulty increases."
