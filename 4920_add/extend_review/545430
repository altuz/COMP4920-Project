,Recommended,545430,30114572,Posted: 23 February,all,Twee,Game is a lot of fun I love it because I played the hell out of Rampage as a kid and this brings me back to that. The controlls are solid and powerups are interesting as well. Just played for a little bit but I would spend a lot more time on here trying to get everything you can. Well worth the value to a nice throw back to a awesome game. Would reccomend to my friends and others that are on the fence about it.

,Recommended,545430,30113617,Posted: 22 February,all,CraX,"Well, so far I'm loving it. My only complaint is the price, I feel $15 is a little bit much. Maybe $7-$10 would be betterI do love the ads though. I've seen Vinesauce, Idubbbz, Filthy Frank, Sr Pelo, ""Gender Water"" (that was pretty clever), and I'm sure theres a shit ton I haven't seen yet."
,Recommended,545430,30296315,Posted: 3 March,all,Mistress Spitfire,"This game came the bumble-♥♥♥♥ out of nowhere and it's without a doubt becoming one of my prime picks for Game of the Year this year. I've been a fan of the show for a hell of a long while (And I've read plenty of the comics that kicked off the show itself) and this game is not only a fantastic tribute to one of the most nostalgia-filled, city-smashing romps of all time, Rampage, it's also a fantastic continuation of the plot of the show.Straight away from the gameplay, you'll instantly draw some comparisons to the game Rampage, and you'd be right, the aim of the game is to level the city as quick as you can and not be obliterated by the army trying to shoot you out of your mad frenzy. This game is a lot quicker than Rampage is, though, making it ideal for a good 20 minute game session when you've not got much else to do, and it's incredibly addictive, each run you do giving you the chance to unlock bonuses that'll be unlocked for you to buy in future runs, money earned from each run gives you a shot to pay in to unlock new powerups that'll drop from buildings, you'll discover something new each time you play.Now the game itself is relatively short from start to finish, but that's not counting the game's countless unlockables, multiple endings and RIDICULOUS difficulty. Seriously, I've been playing games like these since birth and I've only ever reached the final boss ONCE in my hundreds of runs, and hell, that's only on the normal difficulty! The hardcore difficulty setting is sure to keep you from getting bored, and you're certainly not going to beat the game in the span of a day.Some people will comment on the price, saying it's a little costly for an indie game, but I've sure as hell got my money's worth out of it, and I intend to put hundreds more hours into it down the line. No game's had me this hype for a long, long time. Not to mention the dev intends to continue to add and update the game down the line, adding more content, powerups, cutscenes, etcetera.Without a doubt, 10/10 masterpiece. This is the ultimate trip down memory lane, and a fantastic homage to one of the old arcade greats.Oh, and the dev's gone on record saying that 'This isn’t just a love-letter to one of my favorite games. It’s also a way to tell a strong interactive story'. There's a good ♥♥♥♥ing reason for this, I managed to get one of the endings spoilt for myself early on, and... whooph...If you're a fan of the Bedfellows show, this is a must purchase."

You can also use the money you collected in a card flipping mini-game in the main menu to raise the base strength of the power-up collected. There are also bosses to fight that grant you mounds of cash upon defeat as well as mini games to play in-between levels for a chance at more bonuses. Money grinding for powers which will need to be grinded as well will add replay value to your game. The game is also loaded with memes and in-jokes that should put a smile on the faces of fans and non fans alike.This is the portion where I list known issues with the game. I won't put it here because I don't wish to write the same thing twice. If you go to the forums and seek my name you'll find a detailed list of every known issue that I, and maybe you, will find while playing. The only other thing worth mentioning is the fact that these issues still have not been fixed since April.I still like the game overall but casual and non grind happy gamers may not be too keen on this game. If you are a casual gamer and are on the fence but like what it is parodying then here are some choice words that may determine if this is the game for you:The zootopia parody porn billboard made me laugh the mostMake sure you hold the run button so you can have a easier time jumping over the robot cop with huge jugsI lost almost twenty times at the second boss bcause the two fetish german foxes kept tag teaming meThe fat cat boss kiled me by throwing his underwear at meThe only way I was able to beat the wolf in the speedo was by peeing on himI was killed by a giant dragon♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that ascended from the sky after obtaining the ""powerup"""

Smashing buildings, climbing them, killing civilians and army units. Thats the similarities. I actually have rampage with many other arcade classics in a arcade machine and this feels familiar. However its been a long time since i played the classic, but i remember it being my favorite to play with my family and also friends.Pros:Wide variety of power ups and trinkets( also called bonuses in this game)Binding of Isaac like Menu, displaying all these items once unlocked with a description describing what it specifically doesChallenging bosses/challenging levelsModern retro sytleNice enviromentspower ups are actually helpfulGood music but i wont remember it at the end of the dayHelpful tutorialconsistent curreny-just moneyCons:From what i can tell, the civilains are the same throughout the game with changing enviromentsLack of characters?-small nitpick/ but i am totally fine with it, but i am just informing other customers about itGrey:Sometimes you will have to grind money to unlock permanent power upsThoughts/first impressions:Its an enjoyable game and i am suprised and impressed how good this game is"

The thing that is different is that you can upgrade in between and the minigames, which unlock more upgrades for you. All in all a solid game with fully voiced sequences, Parodies and Homages.Ish there Kystahl in?No.If you like Bedfellows or/and Rampage and have no problem over implied sexuality and violence against animals, this one is worth a buy!Just not for 15 Bucks. Man...get that price tag down, please.All informations true as of time of writing. If you felt offended by anything written or said, you may as well keep and dwell on it.

,Recommended,545430,30207277,Posted: 26 February,all,エズィデニアサ,"If you don't know the bedfellows, don't play this game, because you will miss allot of the jokes and references. So I guess you can than rather play the original or just watch some bedfellows beforehand.If you know than great because you will see allot familiar stuff. There is hard anything to tell, you smash♥♥♥♥♥♥up and be gian thingies. While Sheen and Fatigue talk sometimes. There is really not many more to do. And hell yeah it is sattisfying. Also the splitscreen multiplayer is fun as hell, and while it should be easy since you are two and can revive each other it is somehow harder but fun, allof of fun. Combined with that mussic, that pumping music. It is a real killer you can just release streß, okay for streß releasing I rather do something else.^^ If you get my innuendo. But I can reccomand it. But it might be a bbit expensive for many, I mean it is a bit shallow for 15 bucks so I recomend picking this up for under 10 bucks.There is really nothing much else to say except, what the ♥♥♥♥ gender is Fatigue?"

If you've ever played the classic Rampage games then it's pretty simple as to what type of game this is: SMASH ALL THE BUILDINGS! Not to mention the references in the game are nice little touches to the game (like the Vinesauce board.)

76561198009781566,Not Recommended,545430,30159129,Posted: 24 February,all,HammR25,I played for 13 minutes and it's not for me.  There's a certain game from arcades back in the day where you go on a rampage with monsters and destroy buildings.  This game has pretty much the same gameplay as that one but with some small differences.  It's also got a story and cutscenes.  The ones I saw were humorous and well done.I played with an Xbox 360 controller and the controls works well.The things I didn't like:Apparently I seem to think this particular style of gameplay should have stayed back in the 80s as it's boring for me now.The game is capped at 30 FPS.

,Recommended,545430,30731011,Posted: 25 March,all,John The Werewolf,"Seeing as I loved Rampage, and I love Bedfellows, how could this go wrong.  Oh it goes wrong.  It goes VERY WRONG!  But in all the right ways.  It's lewd, offensive, and violent; everything you would expect from this kind of mash up.I loved the Sheen/Fatigue commentary during the tutorial, and I had hoped that it would continue throughout the game.  But no.  Any commentary you get through the game is a couple little quips about your gameplay.  Are there more comments in the two-player game?  I don't know.  I haven't played two-player.I liked the two main characters, though I would love to see other playable characters with their own wacky comments.  Maybe that super feminist stereotype from episode #34, since she's apparently just as warped as Sheen.  I'd say Gary the goat from episode #8, but he'd faint at the first sign of blood.I understand it just came out so maybe more variety and content will show up later.  Anyway, yes!  For $14.99 it's worth it."
76561198095011923,Recommended,545430,30799234,Posted: 28 March,all,korvasterindar,"As a fan of both the furry community and of the Bedfellow's series in general, I do have to say that this game is very appealing to me. Putting all of that aside however, lets look at the core of the game.It is a rampage style game, and it doesn't shy away from that, with the central purpose of the game to destroy all of the city area that you find yourself in, of course, with the millitary and police doing everything they can to stop you. The game does possess much of the classic arcade difficulty without feeling wholly cheap, since it doesn't need to nickle and dime you, as old coin op games did. The game also handles and moves far faster than the original Rampage game, giving it it's own fresh and unique style.Additionally, the game also pokes fun, in its own way, at several of the fetishes in the furry community, adopting them as power-up's that can be used to destroy the city your in. Needless to say, this game is not intended for young audiences, just like Sheen and Fatigue are not intended for young audiences.My only real complaint is the lack of variety for the music, or at the very least, a somewhat faltering lack of quality. I am not sure if this was a design descion, to better emulate the style of old arcades, or perhaps personal preference, but I find that after a while, the music does become droning and repetitive, especially after long play sessions and I have previously turned it off as a result.I have yet to see if there are any unlocks or special scenes only attainable by playing multiplayer, and while it does seem to support couch multiplayer gameplay, I have not yet gotten the chance to try it out. As a suggestion, I would recommend lan or online multiplayer capacity where possible.On the whole, for furry fans, fans of the bedfellows, and for fans of classic arcade style gameplay, this game is a must play, as it does appeal to all of those in its own way. I would not recommend it if you do not like the bedfellow's or arcade style gameplay, or furries. You may be a tad out of your element then.A good effort overall and I look forward to seeing more."

Then gete Bedfellows Frenzy.The graphics while not 3d are still fantastc clear and nostalgic of the older arcade era as well as being super smooth. While the cutscenes are almost dead on for a bedfellows cartoon.The gameplay is all the fun of rampage with more depth, cash and drops to spice up the total frenzy going on in the game.The audio is very crisp and on point though some of the voices are a bit hard to hear during gameplay, the cutscenes sound great though.In all if you want a game to sit down and play with your buddy I would suggest this game every time even more so for the price point."
