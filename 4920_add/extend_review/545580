Mouse control ONLY (up and down), increasing speed (which you'll discover within seconds), enemies the same color as the clouds.  Good luck on the 100% at score 500.   Relatively easy, but this game hurts my eyes.Well...time to idle for cards to sell (and get my money back that way).   Do I recommend it?  Not really...especially as they just added a ton of harder achievements...  My personal advice?  Heed the name of this game's title.0.5/10  Why didn't I pay attention to this game's name?  WHY?!?!"

Just dodge for 20 seconds the opened mayo jars and collect the Daim sweets and 2x or 1x multiplier with your rocket horse character. The controls are just over mousemovement and the ridiculous speed makes even the simple graphics worse. Then deinstall."

I thought the Zup-Series dont need much time. Zup series is like an epos from Sergio Leone compared to this lightweight contender.Okay, firstly the game is only playable via mouse, what kinda sucks - and then, you have seen the whole game in 2.5 minutes (lets say half time of 5 minutes).when i got 100% - i saw already all the graphics, and i was already so bored then, through the lack of everything in this game.And the worst of all, I cant recommend this, because, after 1-2 minutes of a playround, the game will increase scrolling level - problem is, graphics are so ""hi-res"" (a good example, this would work a lot better in low res pixel arts), that the sprites are already so tiny, but with this increasing game speed - you just can barely see anything. Its getting so ridiculously fast - you will get either motion sick or your eyes almost starting to popping out your skull. I dont know, maybe its just me - but its almost giving me a seizure - epilepsy - BUT i dont even have epilepsy.A very good example, how a game should not be. No really, i warn you. When i write this review (maybe 15 minutes after play this game - and i played JUST 5 minutes) my eyes are still hurting from this. I dont know, do the indie devs test this - did they not realize- that its just driving your eyes nuts and. Oh my ba - maybe its supposed to be an epilepsy simulator..."

This game features no progression, no story, no good gameplay, no good graphics, and no fun."

I was taught that if a man has nothing nice to say, it is better not to speak.I have nothing good to say about this game. I know it is a bullethell dodger, but with limited dodging and this insane speed ramp, with poor visuals and ""upgrades"" that fade as soon as used, I can say this is not a game. It is interactive, but it is not a game. 1 stage, never ending.Another download for fudging steam achievements and badges. 2017 needs to get out of the ""whats best for profit"" and move back to ""whats best for the consumer."" So many lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games."

,Not Recommended,545580,26495801,"Posted: 8 November, 2016",all,Tablis,"If you watched the gameplay vid on the store page, then you've seen the entirety of the game. Yes, there's no more content, levels, items - no more nothing. No options menu either.The balancing is completely screwed up - the game is too hard. Acceleration and top speed are both too high and as a result, typical play time is around 20 seconds. I have this sneaking suspicion that the game speed is somehow tied to CPU performance and on the author's PC it runs slower. Also, the horizontal scrolling is extremely hard on the eyes due to the blur. I have a hard time describing it, but you were warned (somewhat). The developer responded to these issues by releasing an update containing 50 more achievements (original release had 12) and giving the horse a witch's hat. Great success!The bottom line is that (other than the cards) this title would only have some value for achievement hunters. But I don't recommend it at all, unless you are willing to use a 3rd party program to mess with the game and slow it down. Otherwise, if you try to get the achievements totes legit, you'll suffer for many miserable hours and probably fail anyway. It's not worth it."

If you took the unicorn from Robot Unicorn Attack and made him a horse with a jetpack and then clubbed him over the head a dozen times, you'd end up with the main character of this game. Decent concept, terrible execution. You can 100% this game with some patience and/or random luck. If you get this game with a crafting coupon like I did I suppose it's worth your dime or two dimes. If you are thinking of paying full price for it you should pour boiling hot kumis (fermented horse milk, who knew? Oh right, Google did) into your eye sockets."
