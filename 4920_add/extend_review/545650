For one thing, the balance values appear to be different.However the game has one clear killer to it. It stores its data to a local drive file, and apparently keeps it open during execution. This means that is you do not shut the game down cleanly (such as if you have a power outage or a blue screen), the save file is corrupted, and the game will hang while trying to load it. The only known fix is to delete your save file, which loses all progress you have made to that point. For a long-term game such as this that is unacceptable.Should they ever fix this issue, then it might be a fun game to play in the background."

Instantly reminiscent of Pot Farm which I played a few years back.FYI High Profits was developed by East Side Games. The same game studio that brought us Pot Farm back in 2010. They are pretty much the same game. Considering Adventure Capatlist came out in 2015 I would hold your horses on accusing this game of being a rip off.Joker out

Looking at the screenshots you can already see the very clear similarities. The music isn't great and animation is as you see it which doesn't appeal to me at all. There isn't much you can do right now. Events aren't even free. There isn't any real reason to get this game unless you'd like a lesser version of AdCap about weed.

After looking into it, some individuals also encountered this bug after they tried traveling to the first Game of Thrones-themed launch (a later-game scenario). When the timer ended, and they restarted their game, their save game became corrupted.The only fix is to delete my savegame, and start over again. Two weeks, still nothing back from the developers. I would stay away from this game at all costs due to the horrible customer support and lack of bug fixes."

However, their save files are apparently made of tissue paper.  If you have a crash while the game is running it can corrupt your save game, or apparently prevent you from playing any of the 'events' such as time travel.  I've run into this myself, where I sit at an infinite loading screen waiting for something to happen.  If you report it to the devs their standard response is that you cheated and changed your system clock, and there's nothing they can do to help.  You could back up your save game regularly to keep this from happening, but you're better off picking a more robust clicker genre game to play instead."

76561198060818641,Recommended,545650,29650587,Posted: 2 February,all,RedFalcon,"High Profits. (Get the pun?)Clicker games are often very much alike. But this is different than all the rest, because it adds a different perspective; Cannabis. As far as i know, as of the date of writing this review, this is the only game on steam that displays cannabis in such a way. Sure, it might be mentioned in a game here, there; but this game actually revolves fully and completely around cannabis, and that is what makes it unique from all the other clicker trash.The controls are like all the other clicker games. Bottom line, you don't need an instruction manual.It has some real good 'stoner' stereotypes/puns/cliches to it. I wouldn't expect anything less; not that i dislike it. You have some rather calm stereotypical music playing in the background (only 1 track on repeat), A guy in the background, (presumably you) dressed as a free loving hippy. And well, everything literally is about cannabis.It has achievements, which is always a nice feature to lure you into playing the game in hopes of getting a 100% rating on the game. For most of the achievements all you have to do is reach a certain currency, except for three that require you to participate in a tournament that you can enter.It's been strongly accused of being a reskin of Adventure Capitalist. I hadn't played that for quite some time, but i re-installed it to see the similiarities and differences. My finding: Yeah it pretty much is. Same layout, just different names and titles, with High Profits obviously having the puns of weed names and what not. Adventure Capitalist, being around for longer has more features to it though, it has more achievements and it has a more polished look to it.Yeah, it's a copy of Adventure Capitalist in many ways; but it's good in it's uniqueness of the cannabis. You tell me how much games involve mainstream cannabis. So that's why i recommend it; it is a different type of clicker game to suit a different audience.So yes it is a reskin of Adventure Capitalist.When you want, if you want, you can click on a little thing that resembles a cloud. Puff puff it is called (get it?) And this puff puff resets your game; but theres a catch. Doing this is beneficial in getting more profit from your new game after you have reset. You also want to enter Puff Puff when you have a bit of dough saved up in your bank, because that money gets turned into Puff Puff points or whatever, (a special kind of currency) which you can use to get even better upgrades that help in getting more profit.There are tournaments, but i so far as writing this review, have not entered any. I havn't really seen the point; i think though that it is just another way to increase profits (and three achievements are linked to it.) You of course have to pay currency to enter these tournaments, a high amount of your currency. I'm certain that you don't have to pay gems to enter, but like i've said, i havn't seen the point in entering in the tournament (I also havn't saved up enough money to do so before using Puff Puff.)The gems are the most valuable piece of currency in the game, and so naturally, you need to pay some real life cash for it. No real point if you ask me. Just wait a couple days for the ingame currency.And i have read in reviews and comments, that there seems to be a problem with currency transactions or something like that, where people aren't getting what they paid for, if at all.But paying for gems doesn't interest me, so i'm not going to do it and can't really comment on that in this review.With a certain high amount of money (i mean high; a decillion. (But did you see what i did there: *High* amount of money?) You can purchase gold bars (1 for every decillion) and these gold bars seem to work the same way as gems do. Gold is another valuable source of currency in the game, just under the gems. It almost, and i say again, almost; is the same as gems, but for some things you still need only gems to do, which seems to be only achievements.You can also buy Guano (or perhaps more commonly known as manure, but even more commonly known as just $h!t.) This Guano acts how you would expect it to act. It improves your cannabis production and gives you an increase in money.So there you have it, the review is actually rather longer than i had expected, but never the less, hopefully it will aid you better than just a paragraph. You're reading my review, and so you're reading my opinion. I say it's a good game because as i have stated, it gives you the different perspective of cannabis in a game. That's what makes it unique and a somewhat different game to play."

Only pro from this whole game is that it's about weed. A clear rip off of AdCap with added bugs and unstability. This game basically forces you to spend money to get any where near finishing the game. The added multiplier bonuses definitely do not work either. I have about 15x multipliers atm and feels like 2.5x. Don't waste your time on this trash, just go download AdVenture Capitalist, it's free and filled with more content."

,Not Recommended,545650,29492722,Posted: 25 January,all,Reppinhigh,The game is a pretty decent clone of adcap if you like clicker games. I've gotten nearly to the end and I unlocked the time travel world but it won't load so there's not much else I can do here.  If they fix the other world and keep updating the game I will change the review.1 month edit: They still havent fixed time travel but you can still buy speedups for it. The world will never load. This game should be reported to steam at this point and removed. Still do not recommend this game.
,Recommended,545650,29719641,Posted: 5 February,all,AndyBeans,"This game is awful, it's just 10 progress bars, but it's redeeming point is that you don't have to actually play it, just occasionally boot up, spend the funds on upgrades and close down. Despite this I have still played almost 50 hours... usually whilst playing another game at the same time.The perfect game for people with memory issues and short attention spans who have to take constant breaks to... do other things."
,Recommended,545650,29719647,Posted: 5 February,all,Joozian,"Well, I like herb. Thought this might be a fun waste of time, and boy was I right! They have these minigames that are seasonal. Right now is ""Game of Stoned"". It took me about a week to earn enough (in-game) to buy the minigame, and then 3 days of ""waiting time"" (without spending gems, i.e. cash) to activate it.I was ready. I was pumped. I load it up, annnnnd it's gone.Minigame wouldn't load. 5/7 best waste of time I've ever had."

There is a noticable lag when you click for an upgrade, Say upgrading the same thing 8 times. Click pause click pause you get the idea.There is a big lag the first time you open the upgrade screen. The game has not crashed on me yet.The upgrade steps are pretty big. 25.50,100,200,300 and the first reset at 100 puffs to me 3 days to get to. I expect it will be a good 3+ months to finish the game.My only negative is that since I'm colorblind, it is hard to tell what upgrade goes with with item, since the art is similar.All in all, a nice idle game that I will have in my rotation for a while"
,Recommended,545650,30067447,Posted: 20 February,all,ShadowStep,This is a really good game to play when you are waiting for another game to download. it does get really repetitive after a while. I got bored of the game and started to hack it to get up to the top of the food chain and it didn't get any better.

,Not Recommended,545650,29803709,Posted: 9 February,all,Neidmeer,"GeneralPoor formulas for progression:After a long wait and reset, you feel you have progressed, but in fact you didn't. An example that many upgrades always give you either x2 multiplier on profit or speed, even though they cost 200x the previous upgrade. In other games you usually see x2 profit -> x1.5 speed -> x5 profit -> x3 speed etc. But here it's just plain x2 for either profit or speed, draging the game along. After some time you realize that the upgrade you have been saving for, is just not worth it --> no progressionMANYbugs:People are reporting many bugs at the official forum, and the 'Game of Stone loading bug' also happened to me.Poor ripoff from Adventure-Capitalist:Everything is pretty much a poor/bad ripoff from adventure capitalist (which happens to be my most played game considering gametime). The mechanic (upgrades, managers, etc.) and graphics can't be considered 'game-worthy'.ConclusionIcan'trecommend this game, even though it's anOKidle-/clicker-game due to reasons stated above and many more.The devs are mabye just weedheads thinkingHey, let's make a game about WEEEEED, cuz' weed is cool, right?
