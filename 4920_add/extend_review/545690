,Recommended,545690,26486750,"Posted: 8 November, 2016",all,Snowdusk,"VOI is a visual puzzle game which features three simple premises:1. Black shapes occupy positive space, while the white background/shapes occupy negative space. (black = 1, white = 0)2. When black shapes overlap each other, the overlapping part becomes white negative space. (1 - 1 = 0)*3. When a black shape overlaps within a white shape, the overlapping part remains as a black positive space. (1 - 0 = 1)Though simplistic they may sound, these premises can produce a variety of brain teasers. Each level requires the player to arrange a set of shapes so that it matches the given picture. The earlier tutorial levels are straightforward, but soon you'll probably find your own eyes playing tricks on your mind, especially when it's hard to tell where you need to overlap the shapes exactly.On the other hand, the level navigation needs work since there is no proper ""menu"" for the players to jump into a specific level. Aside from that, I highly recommend this game if you're intrigued by visual and spatial puzzles.*I'm aware that the creator of the puzzle uses an addition equation (1 + 1 = 0), but I feel that the subtraction equation makes it easier to explain the concept, and it makes much more sense mathematically."

For me it was a nice little bit of brain exercise before bed anyway.If you like these unusual, small, 80p puzzle games that are popping up everywhere at the moment, this is definitely one to add to the pile.The only thing I didn’t really like about it was the fact it has no “finishing screen”, you usually get a screen that says “thanks for playing” or something of that nature but instead you just finish the last puzzle and it kind of just gets stuck there and it’s like, oh, that’s it.I guess for 80p you can’t moan too much though.Either way, I’d recommend it, why not."

Recommended.Pros:- No tutorial required.- You can easily play without the sound on if necessary.- It’s possible to verlap two black pieces to give white (so you can hide the last unwanted piece and reach the final step)- Unique form other puzzle games on the Steam store- Low priceCons:- The lack of colour creates too much contrast between the pieces. And also white background doesnt help at all.- When I started to play with the puzzle and grab a piece, it was really difficult get rid of it. It had some special tendencies to stick in the solution that I tried to create. (I figured out, that it’s faster to take it and stick it into another piece in an unwanted pile of pieces). It would be great if the dev added another area where I can place unwanted pieces until I want to use them. Or lock pieces to the dots in the solving sandpit.- The end, ehm... cough... unfortunately there is no end, nothing, no note ... ""You are great and a smartass now""... no fireworks... no cats (which always help to improve a game ). So why should I play it again?"

,Recommended,545690,32348382,Posted: 11 June,all,Ted,A simple in scope but often pretty challenging puzzle game if geometric puzzles aren't your thing.  It is a layered tangram of sorts but instead of using blocks next to each other to form a shape or pattern you layer a black shape on a black shape making any intersecting area white. The ultimate aim of creating a target shape remains the same however.It could have perhaps done with the scope of the puzzles changing as you go through the levels in more interesting ways.  Despite it being quite short I think if there were slightly fewer levels with the complexity or size increased as you reached the end I would have felt more satisfied.I enjoyed my time with it though.  Good stuff.

In essence, you move a few pieces (3 to 5, in general) around until the overlap matches the goal image.  Nothing esoteric, just nice.  The only issue I have is that with the final level (level 66), the game gives no indication that it's solved and doesn't pop up the final Achievement.  Yet, that Achievement is actually there in Steam.  I bought the thing for $0.49 during the Steam Winter Sale, so it was definitely worth it.

The game's concept is good, but the puzzle design could definitely be improved to make it more difficult. Also, I'm sure there could have been a way to add more progression in the game, like adding different challenges and concepts with colors and stuff.If you want to spend 30 minutes on simple puzzles, the price isn't too high so you can give it a try, but if you're looking for a challenge you won't find it here."

I really enjoyed the puzzles, they were all fun (though I felt some of them in the later levels were too easy, so I guess they weren't categorized by difficulty). I did it all without a walkthrough; sometimes it's just a matter of playing around with the pieces until they somehow work together.My only complaint is that you can only go from one puzzle to the next; there is no level page, which makes it difficult to go back and play previous puzzles. Each puzzle unlocks the next, so if you get stuck you should come back later with a fresh mind.Despite those things, I really enjoyed this kind of puzzle.

,Recommended,545690,29771263,Posted: 7 February,all,Sandalwood,"VOI is short and simple.  If you ever played with tangram puzzles as a child, the concept should be very familiar--use the shapes provided to recreate the example shown.  The interface is very minimalistic and the puzzles are not necessarily arranged according to difficulty, though I personally only found a few of them to be a challenge.  One may take you five minutes and the next may take you five seconds.The developer should have at least added a main menu as well as an end screen once the last puzzle is complete.  When I finished it and the achievement popped, I stared at the screen for a few seconds before I realised that was it.  I had to close the game from the taskbar because I did not see an 'exit' button anywhere.I was finished the whole set in roughly an hour--before all of the cards had even dropped.  All in all, worth the dollar.  Short.  Simple.  Fun."

76561197989132185,Recommended,545690,27915939,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,pulp-reduced,"VOI, short game, scarcity of mechanics, bound to be a short review. This would be an example of a Zen-like game. It's minimalistic, has a simple rule-set, two positives equals a negative, two blacks make a white, etc, but quite quickly you realize there is a nice interplay of reason and intuition.It is this interaction of vague logic with intuitive or trial and error game-play that makes the game not entirely Zen, but instead at times quite frustrating. It's not like other similar experiences that are minimalistic and rely heavily on sound and simple mechanics to create some type of relaxing situations. It does not retain its tranquility in a consistent way. Not that it's a bad thing, but it goes from intuitive and pleasant to logically dizzying swiftly, and without consistency.I'd say the vast majority of the puzzles are very simple, they are solved within a 30-second span of time. Then we have more complex ones, that I for no good reason understand the complexity of. Usually you can count how many square dots the new form you are creating is confined to, and you can at times reduce the possible positions of the forms you have available quite a bit, “this particular shape can only be created by having this piece here”. So you start to build up this logic for how to approach the puzzle, but it all breaks apart as soon as you run into a wall, after having tried these methods. At least that was the case for me.Perhaps my thinking with shapes is not as sharp as it should be, or could be, and I suppose that is where the difficulty of this game sometimes come from; not knowing how to create one set of shapes with a different set of shapes. It is so deceptively simple that it's infuriating to not be able to pinpoint a method or thought-process to deal with these puzzles. The puzzles that were solved within 30-seconds were so intuitive that it felt brilliant, I solved it before I could acknowledge “Yes, that's how you do it!”. And many times I redid the puzzles after having thought “What was it I actually did here?”.The puzzles are always solved in a sequence, and after you apply the method of looking at how the shapes interact with each other and within what confines they need to exist, solutions come about almost automatically. This adds to the idea of a calm and relaxing experience, every solution is coupled with a pretty sound and a clear sense of progression and accomplishment which reinforces this feeling. But then you have the ones where you get stuck. I probably had one or two of them that I was stuck on for at least 20 minutes each one. Each time I thought to myself that I had hit the difficulty curve, but after every such difficult puzzle, the subsequent puzzle was solved in a matter of seconds. If this was intentional, it's a very nice aspect, and relieves a lot of that frustration. The worst thing in a game is to hit a wall, after which you hit an even bigger wall – it becomes somewhat demoralizing, unless you like that kind of thing, a “challenge”. While it is possible this difficulty curve was a matter of chance, a lapse in logic or luck not at all to do with the puzzles themselves or any intentional difficulty spike from the developer, My experience became ameliorated as a result of the fortunate difficulty-flux.I believe, despite its simplicity and lacking visuals, that it holds up as a game. The audibles are constituted by a general droning of soft meditative tones, which further adds to the relaxation factor, despite being a distinct loop. Looping drones usually add to what I consider to be relaxing, but I imagine that's far from a universal opinion. The audio could similarly be called minimalistic, and if minimalism isn't you thing, then obviously this game isn't either, more than for its (to my knowledge) novel game mechanic. It's a nice holistic experience, every aspect fits together well and makes for an interesting exploration of a simple game-mechanic based in a logical rule and geometrical shapes. If you are in the mood for an at times relaxing, at times challenging, puzzle-game, this is cheap and short enough to not really serve as a risk by any means. I imagine it is also more pleasant if you, instead of forcing yourself to try to figure out a puzzle, leave it and come back to it later, maybe even another day. That seems to reset your mindset a bit, and gives recourse to the intuitive solutions, and eliminates the greater feelings of frustration. Have fun, or not."

It leaves you still moving the piecies around as if you didn't solve it.  As I exited to relaunch it and try again, I noticed I had earned the Level 66 achievement (despite the lack of a popup).- I would have liked a slightly bigger work areaToo many times I was trying to ""uncover my mess"" and move pieces out of the way, when a corner of the piece would be off the edge, so it'd fly back onto the pile.  Many, many times this would happen.  Enough to be annoying.- Graphics Glitches?I was surprised that from about Level 35 on there was a white mask overlaying part of the screen that would obscure the Level Number when it would display.  No biggie, but with how little graphics there are, it's quite surprising to then have graphics messed up at all.  BTW, restarting the game a few times, switching levels, and changing from windowed to full screen mode didn't change it.Overall:  A neat little puzzler for a couple hours.  8 out of 10"

Arrange the provided shapes in such a way that your result matches the target shape. Your workspace includes a dotted grid so you can have a sense of scale.Some minor visual gripes:Over time, the frequently ""used"" background dots seem to wear away.Sometimes the overlaps appear to be slightly off and you see trace outlines of what should be invisible.Neither of these is game-breaking, as they don't prevent correct solutions from registering, and there's sort of a snap-to-grid function at a very fine scale.Larger gripe: The game doesn't let you know that you've solved the final puzzle (although it does properly award the achievement). Even with a correct solution, there is no congratulation, no roll-credits, no jump menu back to beginning. It just stays on puzzle 66 and you think you got something wrong. I retried 3 or 4 times before I realized I had already been given the achievement.I tore through this game in a sitting, and if you're a fan of this type of geometric puzzle, you'll probably tear through it quickly as well.

It's far from being perfect, and I have alotof pet-peeves that I'm going to list soon, but for the price of this game, I'd recommend it.Here are the pros:- Straight forward and easy to get;- Very cheap (as of writing this review);- Intuitive and interesting.And the cons:- This game doesn't have an user interface: you start at the game, no pause: just a button to turn off the music and a button to turn off ""FX"" (which didn't seem to make a difference for me). There is no level reseting: you have to switch between levels to restart. No quitting button either: pressing ""esc"" toggles windowed mode, and then you close it;- The ""board"" is way too small and finicky, making you have to ""struggle"" to move pieces around. Could definitely use a bigger board (or one that wasn't round), or maybe even a ""pocket"" to keep pieces you're not using instead of putting them in the corner while solving the puzzles;- The rendering of the pieces wasn't really that good: some edges would overlap in weird ways. Also, the level number that display in the middle of the screen gets messed up after a while, so you can't really tell in which level you are except for the achievements;- The gameplay itself is wonky: getting pieces near the edges of the board will make them go back to their original position, even when you've technically placed them still inside the boundaries of the board. This game could also use some sort of piece highlight for when similar pieces overlap and get white: you can actually lose the pieces if you don't pay attention. And even if you do, you can't pick specific pieces when overlaping: the one you get is the one you get. You have to put it aside to get the ones beneath it out (refer to point #2);- I'm okay with simplistic styles, but when it's so simplistic that you don't have much to do, I don't quite like. This game has too few elements to go on: it's basically play the game or not play the game, no middle ground like a menu or pause, or settings to poke at;- The puzzles were quite fun, and although this might be because I was lucky/unlucky, the difficulty curve felt rather random after the first few puzzles: some levels were really tough, taking like 5 whole minutes, but the next one could be solved in 10 seconds;- Last, but not least, the last level just sits there. After you solved it, it doesn't do anything: I genuinely thought the game had bugged out and didn't recognize that I beat the level. It doesn't display any messages or change anything (like going back to the first level or resetting the same). So you may just sit there for a while trying to understand what went wrong.I think that, given an update to improve some of the points I mentioned would make this game much more worth it. The idea of the puzzles is pretty neat, but if it wasn't for the low price, I wouldn't recommend. Still had plenty of fun with it, it's quite challenging and gets you thinking in all sorts of strategies!"

No quite button that I could find.2. Sometimes levels would not show which number I was on.3. Level 66 didn't end after the puzzle was solved.Aside from that. Great game if you love puzzles!

I enjoyed figuring them out and playing with it, even though it's taken less than an hour to complete it.It's not perfect - after you play for a while, the dots in the middle of the screen start to disappear which can obscure things. It also freezes every time I open the steam overlay which isn't ideal.It's also so minimal that the game doesn't end when you finish the last level, the only feedback you get is the Steam achievement popup.But hey, it's super cheap and definitely worth the money."

It's fascinating how many different shapes you can get out of the same fragments, so you don't get bored trying to find the solution."

76561198047705987,Recommended,545690,29698791,Posted: 4 February,all,RareBreed,Really nice puzzle game. It only has 60 different puzzles and therefore the game can be finished pretty fast (I finished it in 90 minutes). So if you think the price is appropriated for 1 or 2 hours solving puzzles I can definitely recommend it.

Nothing happens after you hit a certain level (won't reveal the number) and it just comes to an abrupt end with no real visual cue. It's fine for an hour or two of entertainment for 1 dollar."
,Recommended,545690,35012238,Posted: 16 September,all,wyulf,"there are a couple of technical issues with this game (for myself at least). firstly, there's no proper way to quit, save to force it (alt+f4). hitting escape merely puts the game into windowed mode. secondly, when you finish the game, there's no real indicator. the game doesnt loop back to the beginning, nor is there a credit roll, etc. it just ... stays there.BUT that being said, those are fairly minor issues in what is otherwise a pretty fun game. while it starts off really easy, it does get more challenging as the game progresses. it's a unique puzzle game, which is fairly basic in it's mechanics, but at the same time, quite a bit of fun. it is however, sadly, a bit short. for that price though, you cant really go wrong, nor argue too much about it."

Finishing final level doesn't give celebration.
