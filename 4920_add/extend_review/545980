Anyway this is worth the amount it wants as its a proper remaster of an old time classic and one of my favourite games.

,Recommended,545980,32329105,Posted: 10 June,all,XXXb00r0ne,Voodoo Vince: RemasteredVoodoo Vince: Remastered is a great game for people who havent tried voodoo vince and an amazing nolstalgic expirence for people who played Voodoo Vince on the orginal Xbox. Phil spencer really stepped up and showed that at his heart his a gamer and not afraid to make/remaster games that may not bring in a lot of revenue. Voodoo Vince: Remastered has made me take a diffrent outlook to xbox as a brand entirely.Pros- Great soundtrack- Great humour- Constantly being updated and the devs are keeping good communication- Takes 8-9 hours to compleate if you're not achivment hunting- Only $15Cons- Although there is a massive improvement in graphics and a 60fps upgrade it would be nice to see it pushed further- When the game came out cutscences would bug out and the video and audio would become de-synced (this has been fixed)

Runs flawless without FPS dips or crashes. Just about everything I have to say about this game is positive, aside for some minor things like the pausing sound effect being really loud compared to everything else.

Anyway as I had typed 'Voodoo Vince', the suggestions came up with ""Voodoo Vince Remastered"" and I was like lol nah that can't be real. I watched the trailer and here I am now. This was(still is)one of my favourite games from my childhood and I'm so stoked that Beep Games, Inc. actually remastered this game.If you enjoy platformers I highly recommend this game.ProsFun gameplayHD GraphicsConstant 60 FpsNostalgiac for people who owned this gameConsPressing escape in the main menu closes the gameNo mouse support for the main menu/pause menu. (You need to use arrow keys)Playing in fullscreen windowed mode with a monitor with a refresh rate higher than 60 causes the game to speed up accordingly to the refresh rate. (I'm aware the game has just come out and will hopefully be fixed soon)That's all I have to say about this, so many memories are flowing back to me as I play this game. Thanks for reading my review.I'll change the cons list if the bug ever gets fixed :)"

,Recommended,545980,31212987,Posted: 17 April,all,MadClown,"So far so good.  HOWEVER, the game logic is tied to the framerate.  Playing in fullscreen seems to lock it at 60, but borderless fullscreen can present a problem if you use a display higher than 60hz."

,Recommended,545980,34676090,Posted: 1 September,all,High King Herb,"Voodoo Vince was one of those obscure Original Xbox games that didn't get much attention.While this game itches a satisfy nostalgia itch, there are more reasons this game deserves some praise.Original xbox emulation isn't easy, same goes for trying to port these type of games.The pros and cons will be written with new-players in mind. For nostalgia players, this game is a must-buy. There is nothing I have to say convince you, it's a proper remaster. But for those who have never even heard of Voodoo Vince before, this is what you want to hear--------------------------------PROS:-1080p 60+fps-Controller support-Updated textures from the original (2003 release)-Smooth Platforming-Foot-tapping soundtrack (Majority of which is Jazz)-Rememberable voice acting, such as the main character Vince (Ken Boynton).-Hubworlds with unique level design-Devs that respond to community upsets via quality of life patchesCONS:-Besides steam achievements, there isn't any sort of incentive to collect everything the game offers.-Platforming can be unforgiving. With lives, you can find yourself resetting to the last checkpoint with a certain tricky spot.MILD UPSETS:-No 4k VR support or paid mods ;-)--------------------------------TL;DR: Voodoo Vince Remastered does pretty well for a 2003 xbox game. It's a lot like the TY remasters, the devs are listening to the community trying to make patchfixes that improve the quality of the game. If you ever played Voodoo Vince before, this is a must-buy. If you've never heard of the game, and are interested in platformers, it is worth the risk in my opinion."

Other things are just nitpicks really, for example that the bosses and the game in general is pretty easy.Definetely worth picking up if you enjoyed classic games like Rayman 2, or if you have played this game before and want a nostalgia trip back."
,Recommended,545980,33923953,Posted: 31 July,all,Faithless [助けて],"My first experience with Voodoo Vince:- Got into the main menu screen and instantly got hit by a brick of nostalgia- Loaded up the game and became overwhelmed with joyIf you knew what this game was back in 200X when it came out and you enjoyed it then, I really can't say much more than pick it up again. If you were anything like me when I first played it as a wee little fetus who had barely escaped the clutches of my mothers loins and you enjoyed it then and even had good memories with it then just buy it again and get hit with that same brick that hit me and (I hope) many others.However, if you haven't played the game I'm not sure if you'll enjoy yourself. Although its an amazing game with a great overall theme (the whole, almost suicidal doll, Jazz music and style), it isn't without its problems that certainly come up today.The enchanced graphical improvements really make the remaster something for older players returning to the game it's still nice if you're jumping in for the first time. Now, on to the outstanding problems I have with the game.- Firstly, the game itself when compared to other platformers out there it doesn't do anything new as far as platformers go. You've got the standard normal punch attack, followed along by the legendary helicopter attack that completely eliminates the purpose of the punch attack.- Secondly, the boss fights in the game are rather easy and tedious at times, because I only found myself dying by my own hands. Whether I press a wrong key and tumble to my demise or stop paying attention and run into the boss on accident with little to no health.- At times the camera feels... Unnatural and has to be fought with every now and again just to get out of Vince's velvety ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so you can finally identify those growling noises you've been hearing for the passed 2.5 milliseconds.- Some levels/sections can become tedious *cough* I'M LOOKING AT YOU SECTION WHERE YOU HAVE TO BUILD THAT ♥♥♥♥ING HOT AIR BALLOON *cough*. This may be due to me remembering as soon as I saw the loading screen for that section and thinking: ""Oh ♥♥♥♥ I remember this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."" And then procceded to wade through that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to move on.- You basically have an infinite amount of hearts (which are things you find scattered throughout a level to obtain more lives) ( also I'm pretty sure this was in the older version too). Because whenever you boot the game up you can travel back to a previous location and the hearts will all respawn in the same locations. I don't know if this was on purpose or not but it somewhat takes away from the sense of danger the game has. Even if you never use it you always know you can just ""go back"" if you're left on a single heart.All in all if you like a well-grounded, interesting and amusing at times platformer (and can of course excuse the faults) then by all means pick it up. Because myabe... someday... We might just get a sequal... Who the ♥♥♥♥ am I kidding, we're never getting that♥♥♥♥♥♥"

This game was one of those, previously only playable on an original xbox. It's now been brought back to steam, remastered for everyone to enjoy! this is a very solid remastering.Arbitrary resolutions60 fps (higher possible but others claim it is buggy, have not tried for myself}higher resolution assestskeyboard and mouse supportof course, controller support with xbox one promptsThe game is also very stable for me atleast. no crashing or weird bugs seen. There is one particular issue where Anisotropic filtering is on a low setting, forcing through your respective graphics card options menu seems to do the trick.Aside from all the technical things, this is a very enjoyable game that should satisfy anyone whos ever enjoyed a platformer from that era of video games.

,Recommended,545980,31347981,Posted: 24 April,all,RoboSensei,"Voodoo Vince: Remastered is a an amazing next-gen port (sans PS4, unfortunately) of the original X-Box Puzzle Platformer Voodoo Vince!Ever since I got the original version of the game back in 2010, I found myself always coming back to play through the game at least once a year, and now I can do that in high definition on my PC without having to hook up the old X-Box.The graphics have been updated phenomenally considering this was an X-Box launch title, as well as clean-cut sound files to make the game look and sound amazing.The StoryThe game stars a 10-inch voodoo doll named Vince who is brought to life by the spilled Zombie Dust stolen by the game's antagonist, Cosmo The Inscrutable, along with his henchmen who have also captured the owner of the voodoo shop and Vince's creator, Madame Charmaine. Vince, with his voodoo magic, must track down Cosmo and rescue Charmaine while meeting and beating a vast crew of comical characters through several levels of puzzle-platforming action.GameplayGameplay for Voodoo Vince is relatively simple yet deviously entertaining.Vince has several moves in addition to the basic run, jump and punch.He can use a spin attack to damage enemies, knocking them back, while also providing as an extension of your jumps.While in the air, Vince can hover to descend slowly, covering more distance while in the air.Vince can also use a head slam attack while mid-air which is more effective on specific enemies.Eventually in the game, Vince will find a special pin which can be used to grapple from targets placed within levels.Damaging and killing enemies will cause them to drop beads, filling a meter that, when full, allows Vince to use a Voodoo Power, hurting himself in various comical ways which will gratuitously yield the same painful death to all enemies close enough to Vince.Throughout most levels are several bags of Zombie Dust, which can increase your health with every 100 bags collected.Some levels contain Skull Pages which, when all are collected in an area, will conjure a Power Skull, which Vince can chase down and collect to expand the count of Voodoo Powers he can hold at once.Minor downsides which may be fixedThere is currently a bug causing a loud sound to play when pausing and unpausing as well as when HUD elements disappearThe key for hovering and first person view are currently the same, and cannot be bound differently, this can cause annoying toggles to first person view when holding hover as you landThere is a sequence in the final levels in which you are flying a plane. Rotating the plane's axis counter-clockwise and firing the plane's guns are currently mapped to the same key and cannot be bound differently. You will have to spin while shooting.Overall, this game is a masterpiece, even now after its original release 14 years ago. Well worth the $15 price tag and will provide an experience you won't be forgetting9.5/10"

,Recommended,545980,32519755,Posted: 17 June,all,jvsael,"Voodoo Vince: Remastered gets all the nostalgia quite perfectly. I can tell you that this game for the original Xbox was one of my favorite things back in my childhood years and, really, the team that brought us this remaster didn't have much work ahead of them other than bringing the original graphics to a more modern standard.The platforming is awesome, the characters very original and charismatic, the story is fun but simple and the worlds are varied and unfolding. This game can be enjoyed by the old players, like me, who have loved this game since the prehistoric times of the original Xbox and for the new players who want to give Vince a try for the first time.The only thing I wish the developers had done was adding some sort of extra content. Although the game is great fun, it is quite short and the ""remaster"" refers only to the graphics and (at least at the date this review was written) no new content has been given to Voodoo Vince. Other remastered games like Age of Empires II gave us some new content here on Steam and I really do wish these guys are able to do just that.As the final note, I'd like to add that, the soundtrack to this game is one of the best videogame soundtracks ever written. Jazz, Blues and Rock all mix together in this perfect New Orleans vibe that gets all the whimsical, satyrical and witty fun this game has perfectly. I really do wish they release a soundtrack soon."

The villians are pretty goofy and it has an all round fun story.The combat isn't bad, although flying enemies are a huge pain, it has a fun use of the voodoo doll letting you use voodoo spells to kill multiple enemies. Being a port from consol to pc, the controls are pretty clean, I haven't really had any troubles so far.Im going to mark down what I like and don't like (P.S i have played this on consol when i was younger, so I will probably be a lot less harsher than 'actual' critics, this game gives me so much nostalgia that I can't truly hate it)What I like:The character - Hes funny and very different which makes him more loveable.The villans - The villans are super goofy and fun to play againts.The combat - The voodoo spells are really cool and its not a bad combat system, although its very basic, its still kind of entertaining.The maps - The areas are so intresting, its odd shapes and interesting uses of pipes from the ground makes it all the more fun to exploreThe narrator - The narrator has such a nice voice and fits really well the theme of 'voodoo'. Its great to have a nice clear woman narrator instead of a generic deep male voice narratorWhat I dislike:The sometimes frustraiting camera angles - Sometimes its very annoying to have a camera not cooperating with you and it happens quite often, although you can have a 360 view by pressing ctrl (for keyboared) it still shifts back it to right afterwards which isn't fun at all.Not being able to choose a voodoo power - You collect various voodoo powers in the game, and some are more cool and or interesting to use than others, and it really sucks that it chooses which one at random, although it doesn't make any actual difference and the animations are purely for variety, it would be fun to choose some that you want to use, but again, in the end it all has the same affect, to kill a bunch of enemies in a area.No new voiceovers: Although I understand why It probably didn't happen, I would have enjoyed it if the voiceover for the Narrator would have changed for players using the keyboared (I.e isteand of saying 'Press the Y button' it would say 'Press the __ Key'. Although this is irrelevent if you play this on a controler ;PFinal thoughts: This game was defenitly worth the money and Im not even close to the end! I had a little more, you could say, encouragement to buy this game since it was a cherished childhood memory to play it on the first xbox. But I truly think that even if you've never seen or heard of this game before, you should buy it and enjoy it! Its fun and goofy with a decent storyline, it have some familiar elements that you see in a lot of games, but it adds its own twists!Final Rating, 8.5/10 -Great fun!"

For those who are looking for something a little different I'd definitly reccommend. The levels are based around their quirky design and unique puzzles rather than just killing the monsters.The remastered version on this hasn't changed in 13 years, but for all you hardcore fans out there the 'Earth Water & Wood' level music has changed ;)A solid 6-8+ hours for a low $18 price tag, not bad at allAlso note that this game is much more enjoyable playing with an xbox one controller.

I've played for a few hours since launch and have had only one problem and that iswhen you unplug a listening device and try to use the sound from your speakers the sound with not work even if you were to plug the listening device back in.I dont know if thats a hardware problem or a game problem but its a very insignificant problem and the only bump in the road.For Any Newcomers to The GameHonestly it's a good platformer from an era that did not shove everything down your throat and force you to play a tutorial. Almost everything in the game is trial and error and almost always self explanitory my only suggestion would be to play through to a save on a new stage if you were to stop playing.

,Recommended,545980,31264048,Posted: 20 April,all,Your Dipstick,Can't go wrong with a classic. This did the formula of 3d platformers a service with its unique charm. This is a fun platformer; better than some recent games that didn't hit the sweet spot of controlled gameplay. It's a bit dated but holds up well.The port turned out great with no noticable bugs or oddities with recent patches.

To my surprise, the game is very well done. Port wise, the game runs excellent on my Nvidia setup. Im playing at 4k 60fps which creates a buttery smooth platforming experience. They touched up the textures just enough to make the game look really nice for a ten year old remaster. Controller support is done properly. Music is catchy and Vince himself is a complete smartass which i love. Hopefully this sells well enough for more Xbox games to make their way over to Steam."

For years I've been searching for ways to play it again. My boyfriend even tried to figure out a way to burn it on a disk from a file he got, and it /almost/ worked, but not quite. It's been years, and suddenly I see there's a new remastered version on Steam.\You can imagine my happiness.This game is the first I ever played, and still my favourite to this day. It's incredibly creative and every level is different. Witty and hilarious, the comedy works for all ages. It's funny enough that I laughed when I was 6, and even now replaying it im understanding jokes that I wouldn't have as a kid.I HIGHLY recommend this game. Everyone should play it, imo. It has a special place in my heart and I really believe it'll earn one in yours too."
,Recommended,545980,33404899,Posted: 9 July,all,TwiliSailor,"A hidden gem against all the odds finds its way onto steam. Voodoo Vince is a 3D platformer of the original xbox, but what makes it special is the unique tone, environments and approach to level design. The wacky soundtrack and unusual settings feel fresh and inspired. Unlike the traditional sand, ice or fire levels seen in other games you will be exploring warped towns, twisted crypts and more.But besides the setting; Gameplay in Voodoo Vince is unique as well. Many of the puzzles and ways of defeating enemies are spun on their head as you try to find ways to hurt yourself and activate your voodoo powers. There is still traditional combat but it takes a backseat to these puzzle elements. Levels are at their strongest when they revolve around trying to find creative ways to tackle a problem, such as lighting yourself on fire to blow up some angry gas canisters. The first area is the best example of this, every problem is so unique and the characters are charming. However some later levels that focus solely on platforming or combat feel mediocore.Many platformers struggle to maintain player interest in collecting all of it's item's but luckily Vince handles this in a perfect way. All collectables that you find have a direct impact on gameplay. Collecting the zombie dust grants you an extra health bar for every 100. The voodoo idols give you different animations for when you use your voodoo powers and the skulls allow you to use these voodoo powers more often. Collectables are also not overbearing. Besides a few exceptions levels are small and well focused. You'll rarely feel like collecting everything is becoming a chore.But as with all games it does have it's flaws. When you run into one of these mediocore levels the cracks start to show dramatically. Odd ledge detection, massive hitboxes (on just about everything), and odd depth perception can ruin the pace. Voodoo Vince does much better as an exploration based game than it ever could with it's platforming. this might turn off the hardcore fans of other more well known games in the genre. But all in all it's a good game oozing with style and originality. Props to microsoft for allowing this cult classic to make it's way to PC."
,Recommended,545980,31361028,Posted: 25 April,all,K7 Avenger,"Voodoo Vince: Remastered is a terrific 3D platformer, with sharp writing and wit, creative level and enemy design, and a unique and upbeat soundtrack to fit its many themed levels, such as its classic New Orleans' Jazz vibe.The performance options are quite limited, with preset low, medium and high settings for fullscreen or windowed, but otherwise the game runs beautifully and looks like a remastered classic should. After a couple of patches by the developers, the game runs perfectly fine at 100 fps (the engine cap I think, maybe it's around 100 or 110). I have only very limited playtime with a keyboard+mouse use, but I would strongly recommend using a controller to play this, although it supports seamless transition between input methods, with UI and buttom prompts changing on-the-fly.Anyone who played the original Xbox version will enjoy this faithful remaster, and anyone new to the game will enjoy the creative and challenging platforming and puzzles, and will certainly laugh at the crazy characters Vince meets on his journey.Reviewed after finishing the game in its entirety."

If you're expecting fully remastered textures, you're not gonna find it here as the updated textures only make the low quality textures feel even more obvious and out of place. even still its a short, fun experience with a surprisingly catchy soundtrack."
,Recommended,545980,35374177,Posted: 1 October,all,Dr__Waddles,"It's one of those games you should just have. No questions asked. Personally, I think it should be less in price, so more people are tempted to buy it, considering it's not that big of a game, but I had just enough (Not a cent more or less), and without a second thought, I bought it. And even though it sits in my library, with little game time, I'm glad it's there.It's a shame this game is underrated, and unknown to the majority. The devs of Voodoo Vince are far better than that of any of those ""Early Access, Survival, Free roam, FPS"" games that seem to have taken over Steam of late.If you know of this game prior to the remaster, then there shouldn't be any questions to ask, apart from how much money's in your wallet. (I was one of these people). And if you didn't know of this game prior to the remaster, then there shouldn't be any questions to ask, apart from how much money's in your wallet.Simple as that."
