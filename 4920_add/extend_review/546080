This was my first game is this genre and i loved it. Now I'm on the lookout for other games like these.UPDATE: EVEN BETTER! The true ending really brings the whole story together with an amazing ending."
,Recommended,546080,33726332,Posted: 22 July,all,Subliminal Smile,"Coffin of Ashes reminds me of survival horror in days past, and I'm talkin' old...like Clock Tower or Alone in the Dark. Back in the day when you had to aimlessly wander a scary house while some mysterious psycho stalks your every move; without the game holding your hand and guiding you through every step of the way. Coffin of Ashes can seem unforgiving at times, even cruel in its old school ways. But you will feel a true sense of accomplishment as you gather your wits and use them to the utmost to survive.The puzzles will really put your brain into cognitive overdrive, sometimes requiring the use of notes (which I'm not complaining about, I love it when games require you to think outside the computer and put pencil to paper to figure them out). I also respect the way the game repurposes common items/sprites/backgrounds in RPGMaker and utilizes them in new and interesting ways. The original art was great as well, adding flavor to cutscenes and helping us to have a more personal connection to the characters. The music and sound effects also help to set the mood perfectly. The protag is adorably deadpan, and it's fun to watch her interact with certain other inhabitants.There's a twist in it, which I certainly won't spoil, but it adds a different dimension to your perception of the game and how its played. All in all, it was a difficult but very satisfying overall experience. Can't wait to see what comes next from the dev!"

But regardless, it's a fun game without a doubt.Music: 9 / 10.Great music and atmosphere.Game play: 9 / 10.Easy to play this without a doubt.Character design: 10 / 10.Love them so much. Especially Ian <3Game's maze difficulty:Easy to comprehend.Game's runaway difficulty: Hard. (Easy if you know the trick)Or maybe it's just me since I am playing the hard difficulty so I died a lot of times trying to runaway from them and either taking the wrong route or got caught up due to getting lost.Overall, great game.No more questions just buy and play the game. > ///w/// <"
,Recommended,546080,31826848,Posted: 18 May,all,angelwolfchild,"Coffin of Ashes is a beautiful game, the designs and character portraits are nicely detailed and work well to create a good atmosphere. The whole game reminds me a bit of Mad Father (which isn't a bad thing) but it still feels like it's own game. Characters have their own distinct appearances while the ghosts look suitably creepy (especially the teddies, seeing those made me nervous every time I went to a save point afterwards). I do also have to praise the puzzles as I think they're really effective and fun to figure out. One of the best parts of the puzzles is the lack of backtracking, you don't move on from an area until you've done everything you need to and once you're in the next part you just keep moving forward. I love games that do this, as while backtracking can work well in some situations it can also very frustrating. Furthermore everything is there to further the story even if it's just in little character moments, in fact the rest area allows you to learn more details if you want to. Some of the chase sequences got frustrating but it doesn't take too much trial an error to get them right. The only technical issue I have with the game is that some of the translations are a little off, not enough to ruin the experience but they are noticeable at times.The story however is... alright, it was engaging enough that I wanted to know what would happen next but nothing groundbreaking or shocking really occurred. I am a little annoyed that one of the best twists in the plot was revealed rather hastily at the end through exposition to the player rather than being something the characters themselves figured out, it feels like a wasted opportunity for something that was not only interesting but helped make sense of other things in the plot to just be tacked on at the end. But there wasn't anything wrong with the story as a whole. I liked the characters well enough, though the main character Delilah felt a little bland; her character portraits made me think that she was going to be one of those characters that always seem emotionless while secretly being quite deep, but if that was the intention it didn't really come across in the dialogue. The others are alright, Ian and Lilin were good companions but my favourite person overall was definitely the Deacon, as he's the only one of the side characters who really showed some personality in his conversation. Like the story the characters aren't bad, they just aren't anything to write home about.Overall if you do like RPGMaker horror-adventure games such as Mad Father, I do think this is worth checking out as the presentation is great and the puzzles are fantastic. While the story wasn't anything amazing it was still good, and for the price it is there isn't anything to complain about.Oh, and that 'Close Encounters' achievement? That can get stuck in an eternal loop trying to leave a haunted mansion because getting that was an absolute pain!"

However, as I played the game more and more, I found it to be very enjoyable. You'll have to play the game a couple times if you want to get the full story, but it's not particularly hard to speed through the first part to get to new content. My only complaint for this game would be the room where you get the bucket. It was a hassle to go through when replaying the game because it's completely dark and you have to try to navigate through it without having any knowledge of where you are going. Even a small light or map beforehand would have sufficed. I thought my game was broken when I first went into it. Besides that, this game is pretty good. The characters are likable and the story is interesting. The puzzles aren't too hard and neither are the chase scenes. If you're on the fence about buying this, I totally recommend that you do get it."

76561198322448472,Recommended,546080,28319606,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,Vipershroom,I do recommend this game it is a horror RPG about a girl looking for her classmates in a abandoned mansion this game has a few tricky puzzles but what i find unique about it that you only go forward there isnt backtracking in this game so the game makes you only go forward by making doors disappear or Delilah saying she doesn't need to go there anymore If your looking for a good horror game this is the game for you

,Recommended,546080,29634013,Posted: 1 February,all,kev,"So far, I'm really enjoying this one, and i'm seeing a lot of potential for further enjoyment. It's a mix of RPG and visual novel, one of the best i've ever seen.StoryThere are about ten stories. At the beginning, it felt that the developers actually put their souls in the story. Great setting and time period, pretty scenary, captivating storylineVisualWell done graphic, an anime artstyle, which is really good. Character design is excellent, and many textures are great to look at.SoundGreat Soundtrack, even i didn't notice it helps keep you focused!I don't regret buying this game (especially when I finished the first ending). Overall, I recommend this as a more relaxing with many puzzles and a good plot."

Though the initial math puzzle wasn't clear and required a peek at a guide, the rest of the puzzles were extremely creative and well done.Yes there are some jumpscares and horror elements but it goes hand in hand with the mystery theme."

There isn't alot of great indie rpg games out there and I was expecting to be disappointed even with the awesome looking character models. It was instead, great,  and I am happy with buying it. There is some hard to understand/figure out parts but once you can solve those, its good from there on. Hope this review helps you atleast try out the game and hopefully enjoy it yourself. <3"
76561198346641970,Recommended,546080,34136376,Posted: 9 August,all,Caller123,"PSA: THIS GAME REQUIRES 2 PLAYTHROUGHS FOR THE TRUE ENDINGThis is a very nice game with cute sprites, good puzzles, and a coherent story-line. I do feel that the layout of this game is a bit big, for lack of a better term. It does feel that they wanted to make the rooms huge, but it makes everything feel so empty. Upon first playthrough, I did feel somewhat disappointed. I was expecting much more for a $7 game. However, after the credits the game asked me to save, then game me the option for a new game. I did just that, and I was presented with different dialogue, different options, and many different things. Granted, it's mostly the same for a bit, but it does take a turn at a certain point. After completeing the 2nd playthrough, I was content with the game. The story ended well, it made sense, and I felt like I got a great experience for my $7. There are a few things that bug me, but I can overlook them in the grand scheme of things. While most puzzles make snese, there are some that is just trial and error (which can take forever to figure out!). So overall, I do recommend this game, especially now since it's on sale."

(I prefer turn-based tactical, e.g., Advanced Squad Leader.) Without a guide I would have just tossed this game. With the community guide, I enjoyed it as much as I could.Pluses: great story and characters.Minuses: puzzles and button-mashing.I would recommend this game to people who like this sort of thing.If you like tacticals and RPGs, not so much."

Coffin of Ashes, is not one of those games.Let me say that the character art is very nice and well done but that was about what I could compliment for my playthrough.The maps are too big and so empty I couldn't even phantom that this was actually a house and the first outdoor map, outside the mansion was not really that nice either. Over all the whole thing feels kind of sloppy and messy.The story, what little there was felt distant and not very flowing and I was downright annoyed at our main characters reactions to things, being a blank slate that just doesn't seem to care about her predicament or her surroundings.Over all, there was nothing to keep me entertained. The maps were empty and uninspiring, the story almost none excistent and the main lead a bore. I am really sorry to be harsh on games but this one just couldn't keep me interested at all.I asked for a refund of the game and I wouldn't recommend getting it unless it is on sale and you are just looking for a little rpg maker horror experience without much substance."
