You put your coin (here is steam wallet money) and play it. A playable fever dream.Exit the screen to win, your score is how many maps you can beat in a row.Super hard.Use a gamepad.Get all achievs.Call friends for a drinking game, the one who scores less will drink. Repeat."

It's a simple but good dodge out of the screen game. You have to reach the screen edges somehow in time before you get squeezed by growing vines or rotating machines. Each screen is one level. The levels are chosen randomly until you reach the end after level99. This game has a very nice claustrophobic atmosphere and sometimes you wonder where to find the exit in one level. That makes it challenging because if you die everything will be reset."
,Recommended,546090,28313268,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,[ Maxie ],"Trip to Vinelands is yet another game that has made me both respect and admire Walter Machado as an indie game developer. Simple yet effective artwork, a decent music track, highly challenging and very addictive.I've been a follower of his work since I got gifted a coupon for UBERMOSH some time ago and it's amazing to see something different. Easy to pick up and play but very difficult to master.Like the other games he's made, this has simple, colourful graphics that just work, a catchy musical sound and gameplay that is simple yet also deep and challenging at the same time.All in all, well worth picking up and for less than £1, it's well worth it."

Also, you can get all of the achievements if you're good at this type of game and/or willing to put in the time to learn the patterns of each unique screen (may require a bit of patience)."

,Recommended,546090,30927666,Posted: 3 April,all,The_Frogstar,"As a warning - this is an arcade game, and extremely basic in many ways. There is no story, difficulty setting, you will die a lot quickly, you can experience the entire game in about 30 seconds and so the game is mainly repetition of the same thing in attempts to get a higher score. If you don't like these kind of games, then even at under £1 this is going to be a waste of money for you.That said it has good music, good atmosphere, good art, good execution - all much like Ubermosh. So if you ARE a fan of these kind of games, I recommend it."

There is nothing much to it.You just run from vines from place to place in a tuxedo. Which is quite difficult for me since my reaction time is slow.But it's fun, you can play it while you wait for your game to download.Worth the money if you ask me."
,Recommended,546090,30835655,Posted: 30 March,all,Nuts,"I added this to my wishlist without knowing much about it. I honestly thought this was going to be a short walking simulator game like The Old City or Dear Esther. Imagine my surpirse when I booted this up for the first time. Completely caught of guard.This is a fast paced game that chucks you in the deep end. All you have to do is get the edge of the screen. There will be giant Vines and Blades blocking your way and closing in on you as you play, so its no walk in the park. You dont really get time to stop and think what to do, you just have concentrate and keep moving. You have to survive for 100 levels with one life. If you die, its back to level one. This gets annoying but it would be pretty bland if you had checkpoints. Having one life keeps this intense and exciting.Its simple so theres not much to love and not much to hate really. It is just a bit of fun. There are only two things that annoyed me. The hit boxes are unreliable and can screw you over. You can get abosered by the Vines and still live or you clip the tip of one of the spikes and die instantly. Its not too big a problem, but when you are on a good run and get killed by something that just barely touched you it can get quite infuriating. The other problem is the ending. This game doesnt try to have a story but it throws in an odd ending that doesnt really fit. It feels like its just there to try and make the game seem more meaningful.However, these don't ruin the game by any means. Its still a fun and tense game that is alright for the 30p I paid for it. If you have some money in your Steam Wallet from selling cards and you want to get rid of it, buy this. You'll either love it or hate it."

Based on my keyboard play, moving quickly enough before dying seemed to be very challenging. The graphics seem to be procedurally generated, and are simplistic and retro, which may appeal to some.  I'd recommend to the developers an easier start into the game, ramping up the difficulty more gradually. As it stands, it's more dying and not enough enjoyment.Make up your own mind with gameplayhttps://youtu.be/HtME7jLlUNk"
