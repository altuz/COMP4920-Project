,Not Recommended,546350,31470159,Posted: 30 April,all,Masoninsicily,"This game seems to be pretty fun. Hopefully some improvements are made (NPC's sometimes bug out by ghosting above themselves while running and chapter 7 stutters so bad I can't play it) but overall it's a fun experience. After 3 hours, it's still pretty entertaining. If you want a more laidback game, I would recommend getting this one.Edit: No response from devs regarding issues, making the game uncompletable. While fun, I would be wary until more updates come out. (Note the 21 hours on my account should be 3 or 4. There was a bug that caused it to crash but steam didn't realize it closed and left it on over night and through the next day before I noticed).Edit on June 19, 2017: Still no response from the devs, no update to fix the issues present."

A bit like Diner Nuo, you will just loose hours in it playing this. its entertaining and fulfiling and the right level of fun and thinking. Great game to play and Show off VR too :D"

I had some frustrations, being left-handed, but nothing particularly bad. The large area the game occupies was fine with my room, but playing for so long became tiring! Not exactly aerobics, but certainly won't hurt!"
,Not Recommended,546350,33939611,Posted: 31 July,all,Nadlug,"It cannot be stated enough just how bad the tracking is in this game. So many other games I havent had any problems with so it isnt my Controllers HMD or sensors. Additionaly the game is one of the rare few that nauseate me. Shoppe Keep did the same thing so its a wonder I even gave this game a shot but thats just me.The game itself is fun, although it hardly presents itself in a playable manner. Very little is told to the player and the controlls for movement... Rotating your perspective and repositioning yourself should not be on the same thumb stick. Tilt the stick just ever so slightly and you change facing completely. Plus if you reposition yourself out of the are the game wants you to be in the video blacks out, good luck getting back to where you need to be now that your blind.Overall the game is entertaining when everything is going according to plan. Unfortunately for me and my Occulus, it never does. Might be better for you guys out there with an HTC Vive with its superior tracking capability. But if you have an Occulus, or something with even less tracking ability. Give this a pass."

I was waiting for this game to come out when i first saw it on greenlight and im soo glad it did.But on that note I hope in future updates they add more too the game like getting the ore your self by going into a cave but, If you have a vive and want a good fun game to start out with, I would suggest you get this. :D"

I thought I would try this game and two and a half hours flew by fairly quickly.  In this game you have a small work area where you craft potions and weapons and ammo for people.  You get paid gold and there is a demand for weapons to fight the big dragon you can see in the background.  There is demand for pickaxes, arrows, speciality daggers, and all sorts of potions.  As the merchant you just click to order supplies to fill the customers orders.  Every once in a while you will get a disgruntled customer, but nothing that an arrow to the face won't solve.  Right now it looks like there will be more than the starting tutorial level.  I was playing mostly in the freeplay mode where the demand keeps comming.  It looks like this game will feature more lore and mission progress involving this dragon.  I can't wait.  This already has replay value for me because it is a lot of fun."

I would say in 'story' there is maybe about 45-60 mins of gameplay as it is right now. There is a freeplay mode which I didn't try."

I have a very small space, but the game was still playable with the teleportation options. The orders coming in had me bustling about my play space constantly, and the teleporation felt smooth and natural. Using the blacksmith hammer felt better than I thought it would, just be sure to hit hard enough. Light taps won't get you anywhere, you're beating hard metal into shape!My only critique would be that some of the text (like the clipboards) was difficult to read without holding it a few inches from my face."

Tutorial text needs a massive overhaul and tool tips on items get obscured by the environment and the item itself. Just remember: If the hammer doesn't seem to be working, swing harder."

,Recommended,546350,26574397,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,monkeywraith,"Already excellent fun and still in early access! The crafting is well varied and enjoyable; it is rather simplified, but appropriately so for the scale. It also ran smoothly; the only oddity I encountered was, on my first attempt repairing the pick, I was holding it when hitting and the pick head flew way off to the pathway. I had to let the time run out and retry. You may want to wait on this title a while, but certainly do not miss out!A few specific considerations:This game will be well worth the money.~ The single current chapter (and supplementary modes) may not be enough for it to be so yet.The teleport options are great!~ Especially quick teleporting to specific ""stations"".~ It could use a couple more stations though, especially one for the furnace.We need a decent way to retrieve items that escape the area.~ Per a forum post, there is probably a way, but it did not work for me.~ Perhaps items that pass outside a boundary should be deposited in the chest.What are we supposed to do with crucibles after pouring the metal out?It seems silly to be grabbying things bare handed right out of the furnace.A must have!"
,Recommended,546350,26639383,"Posted: 16 November, 2016",all,Shadow,"https://youtu.be/GltGo2vlCCsCraft Keep is a lighthearted attempt at a medieval Job Simulator. With BEER!While still a bit rough around the edges, (looking at you random ingredient still rolling away...) it's an enjoyable shop owner experience.The graphics will turn people away. For some reason there seems to be a growing hate for cartoony VR graphics. Personally I think it works for the attitude of the game.I do wish there was a better locomotion option than just roomscale or predefined teleports. My 2.6 meter by 2.6 meter had me hitting the walls even when I was using the smaller room setup.Give me trackpad locomotion, onward style, or at least a teleport that's not locked to 3 specific points. This would also solve the issue of a dropped item that physics throw just out of reach and let it roll down hill..... (not salty at all....)I still need to check out Free Mode. I've been sick and haven't really been able to VR much since recording this last Sunday. With just having burned through the tutorial it's hard to say if it's a worth while pickup or if your 14.99 would be better spent elsewhere."

If this eventually turns into a co-op game with mechanics similar to Shoppe Keep, it will be my new favorite game. The developer is currently very active, previous game (Shoppe Keep) was a lot of fun and still gets updated sometimes, and there's room for a lot of potential."

The game is called Craft Keep VR and it lives up to its name. You get to mine, craft, and attack things.4/10 At its current stage. While the current mechanics are absolutely amazing, there isn't enough actual gameplay. I played for about 2 hours straight and already beat all 3 Chapters (In the game at the time.) I really absolutely love the game, this rating is not because I think the game is bad. It is because I don't think you should buy it YET. Once more content comes out I will be playing the game a ton.P.S. Don't bother trying to get the Airship Ticket in Chapter 3. It just gives you an ingot mold. (As of 2/5/17) I tried filling 5 of them with all 5 ores, none of them did anything except give me an ingot."

Or making the bow that takes down a dragon.While it still has a long way to go, this game is already looking to be one of my favorite vr titles."

Just enough polish and content to make it feel rewarding to complete the tasks requested.  Soundtrack was decent.  Mechanics and accuracy of the controls was above average for VR games at this time.  While there is some humor mixed in already, I feel this could benefit by adding some additional funny moments or tasks to break up the crafting. Performance and stability were good.  A few points in the game seemed to need additional clarification on which larger goal the player should be working to accomplish.  Also, a way to view skill progression while in game would be appreciated.Short version:Worth the buy, family friendly, excellent game to show people new to VR."
,Recommended,546350,30568502,Posted: 17 March,all,Rayeth,"Finally!A review of a VR game that is NOT in early access (anymore)!Gameplay:It is solid. For a VR title it works pretty well although the keybinding is something you have to get used to, if you play a lot of other VR titles. (Grip is assigned to the ""grip buttons"" not the trigger, for example.)But overall it works and does not get tedious. There are some very minor QoL features like distant grabbing and you can either move within your playspace (which is the main thing you need to do, be sure to have enough space!) or by teleporting, so no motion sickness to be expected.Graphics:It looks like it does on the screenshots on the store page. It is decent enough to NOT make your eyes hurt or cause headaches and stays true to it's comic design. There are no apparent graphical glitches or eyekillers. The models have variety (depending on the chapter you play) but are not over-detailed. It's a comic design after all, not a photorealistic one.Content:You play seven (or was it eight?) chapters which, if you focus purely on the quest customers and only do regular customers when really really needed, take about fifteen to thirty minutes to complete, depending on how fast you are.Apart from forging swords you can also do some alchemy and brew potions (which look pretty cool) and are sometimes also prompted to engage with your surroundings yourself. (Sometimes=rarely)The is some sort of backstory to what you do and why you are there but it's just some written introductions to those chapters and it does simply connect the chapters in some way. It puts the player into the main focus and only provides a very brief background story.There is no RPG-related system there, no skills, no levels, just crafting based on the chapter you play.Details, Quality of Life, user-tailored:Well, the devs said ""there was a drop in communication from the community"" but they did not bother to post even a single message for months so I'm not suprised if some people just had forgotten about that game. Sadly, this lack of interaction can be seen in the game too: There is pretty much nothing you can customize, there are no options for graphics, gameplay, keybinding or anything else, really. It does work, mind you, but it could be a lot more use friendly!If you are shorter than average, it might be bothersome to play, if you playspace is very limited, it gets very tedious to play or the ability to turn the playspace (without re-scanning the room via the Vive setup) would make things a lot easier for people that do have just enough space. Those are all things, that could have been implemented since the first launchable version of the executable... (But hey, maybe they did and never told anyone about it, could be the case...)TL:DR=You should probably sell you pc and buy some books if you can't bother to read. (Yeah, that's dedicated to your lifestyle, not the game.)To sum up:It is a LOT of fun to play. It does not cost that much but whether it is adequate depends on the user and how fast they play.There could be more content but there is enough to not make you feel ripped off, the lack of options does however taint the overall impression a bit.If you like VR interaction and crafting, you should definetly give this one a go!"

The game is really funny and i really like game where you have to craft items for customers. My only downside of this game are the Controlls.
