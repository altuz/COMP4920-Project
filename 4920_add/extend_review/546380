I bought the bundle with Neon Arena and I'm not kidding, they seem to be the EXACT SAME GAME BUT WITH DIFFERENT VISUALS (and the previous game from this studio, Axyos seems to use the same engine and same models, haven't played it though so I'm not sure)As for the gameplay; both this and Neon Arena feature identical and very weird controls, aim doesn't actually follow the cursor and thus aiming is really hard. Both games also have the same idea, bad guys come and try to steal things from you, wave after wave. No tutorials, no help, just guys running at you.Verdict? this seems like an unfinished school project and its similarities with Neon Arena are actually quite irritating. Feels like one game and two skins. I know that this is early access but the future doesn't seem bright."

,Not Recommended,546380,34411482,Posted: 22 August,all,FatalThornz⛄,"This games strange in the way it tried to be a top down shooter, moba-like, wave-oriented protect the bucket of chicken objective, all the while shooting aliens to prevent them from stealing your precious cripsy, greasy chicken. Three characters are all the same so they don't matter. The lack of options as well as a windowed mode is somewhat dabilitating. The switch from the top down to third person view is almost essential, unless you like the top down as its easier to aim when can see in front of you. This games a tad too easy besides the bosses who need powerups to be taken out efficiently otherwise they'll spawncamp you. Wait for this to go on sale before you buy this as a joke for your friend."

,Recommended,546380,32622937,Posted: 21 June,all,Nudkuuu',♥♥♥♥yeah i enjoy the optimization. Constant 3 fps with a bad laptop. Im impressed! I definetly dont get constant 40 fps in any other game like this. Great game i suggest you buy it. Especially if you have a shaity laptop.6/7 Would get 3 fps again.
76561198029685813,Recommended,546380,33187786,Posted: 3 July,all,Himbeeren,"Very nice game, I totally recomend it. It's like Dead Ops Arcade but with a very nice reskin so instead of zombies, you're fighting aliens who are trying to steal your chicken. It's the same gameplay all the time, defend the bucket of chicken for 4 rounds and then you are teleported to a new area and do the same stuff again.Conclusion: Very very very nice CoD: Black Ops Dead Ops Arcade reskin with good graphics. I would totally recommend it since Black Ops is so expensive to steam. 10/10"

Благо в этой игре есть то, чего я так давно не видел в играх - кооператив на одном компе! (когда на одном экране вы играете вдвоём)Игрушка чисто для расслабона и на поржать, хоть и хардкорна! Поначалу сложно но привыкаешь и дальше идёт как надо! Это видимо очередная отсылка к простым, весёлым, но хардкорным играм поколения дэнди :)В игре конечно же есть небольшие огрехи, например с геймпада в меню нельзя управлять... т.е. совершенно не критично. Но так поэтому игра и находится в раннем доступе! Наверняка всё доделают!В общем за свои деньги 5 из 5! Зачёт!"

They want our last chicken bucket, we want them dead.""EVEN IF IT IS ON SALE, -90% AS I GET IT, PLEASE GUYS, DON'T BUY IT, SAVE UR MONEY AND TIME!"
,Recommended,546380,32651499,Posted: 22 June,all,Issa🗡😈,"This game is not a terrible game, but it does need plenty of work. I do like the concept of this game acting as an arcade based game, but I found some issues that makes me understand why a majority of people saying this game is terrible. My prime issue is the Tank powerup. When activated, the tank is hard to maneuver, and I do not like that at all. Also, the enemys' health bar does not do a great job determining what health level they are on, especially with the special round boss. Despite these issues, I have faith in the developers. Hopefully, they haven't gave up on this game. A little more tweaks, and this game will be on point for me. 3.5 stars but it is quite fun if you are like me and don't set such high standards for a video game to be great."
