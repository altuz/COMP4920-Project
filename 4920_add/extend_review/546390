,Recommended,546390,29705855,Posted: 4 February,all,BROWCOW,"A weird funny game with some fun intros.  If there were any female characters there would be public outcry trying to ban the game in the US by some very stupid people.  It's funny but very unbalanced and a little rough around the edges.Since it's free, it's worth downloading at least for the laughs."

,Recommended,546390,30023782,Posted: 18 February,all,Running-Target,"Brief Karate Foolish is a free to play fighting game that plays like Mortal Kombat with live action graphics of japanese fanboys fighting it out on japanese streets scenes while wearing briefs.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, was understandable, sounded ok.  Very silly game.  Supposedly, it runs in 60fps.  You need to have an Xbox controller to play.   I guess you can also set the game to use keyboard.  Check the manual before you play in the store page.  It is a single player game or 2 can play on the same computer.Try it, maybe you might like it.For more info:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR7ERLrOa5shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5msdR6iGWwhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNn1lammkGUhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/11/20/brief-karate-foolish-free-fighting-game-in-underwear/#more-414027http://www.oneangrygamer.net/2016/09/brief-karate-foolish-replaces-sexy-underwear-fighting-girls-with-men/12546/http://mmoraw.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2232:brief-karate-foolish&catid=2:action-mmo&Itemid=3http://jp.ign.com/brief-karate-foolish/9354/review/brief-karate-foolish"

76561198053933392,Not Recommended,546390,29861121,Posted: 11 February,all,PurplePony,What is this garbage and why is it slowing down my PC? I can't say I am mad or surprised since I did not have to pay for it and it looked bad from the get go. Button layout is not just trash it also never tells you what it is and there is now way to change the buttons as far as I can see. Are these people actual actors for the game or stock assets or stolen? What I can say is stolen is the fire ball graphic in one of the supers. Speaking of supers apparently they are a thing in this game and I have no mother♥♥♥♥ing clue how to use them. There is a meter that would tell you when you can with most fighting games and this one does not. You can't even say this is good as a joke game. Verdict Guilty IS a joke game but it is perfectly functional and fun unlike this one. This game has no potential. The idea of a bunch of almost naked Japanese men DOES have potential for a great game go but if that is your thing avoid this and stick to porn for now. Or make your own game. Would not be hard to at least make it better than this.

I believe that this year it is Brief Karate Foolish's turn to have that title. Great graphics with a terrific story and incredible physics. Other games such as: Portal 2 and The Witcher 3 pale in comparison to this fantastic game! A solid 10/10.Definitely a must play
