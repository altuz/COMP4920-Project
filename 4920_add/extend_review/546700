But I don`t regret the money and took a chance. I`m very glad I did it, because this game is unusual. Difficult tasks, puzzles...It is the first game, that I`ve seen, with such gameplay structure."
,Recommended,546700,28356096,"Posted: 13 December, 2016",all,pxl_th,"I do like a good thriller or horror game like this so I decided I would purchase it, seen as it's only cheap. The first thing I will say is that the graphics are fantastic. If you play this at night, alone and with the sound on, you really get into it and it's pretty damn scary in places too! There are a lot of puzzles throughout which can be difficult in places but that makes it more worthwhile and gives you more of a sense of achievement.I was happy that this game told a linear story without the immediate threat of an enemy. The puzzles are fun, not too difficult (I did have to look up the answer to one in gameplay video, but the rest were doable on my own without feeling too easy) and it builds a great atmosphere through well-done sounds. Very well, that fear in the atmosphere is transmitted by the graphics and music, with the help of special effects and plot, but not by suddenly jumping monsters.Overall though, for the price this is one of the best detective experiences I've had the pleasure of playing . It's nothing ground-breaking or particularly unique, but it does everything mostly right and is a fun way to spend a late night. Great job to the devs, and I look forward to any new releases. I recommend “The Butterfly Sign” to wide audience, ringing from people who just want to have a good time to the true connoisseurs of detective art."

The game does very little in the beginning to tell you how to solve the problem but after awhile and for some others, some luck you can figure it out pretty fast, it took me QUITE awhile because I didn't know exactly how it wanted me to solve the problem. The intro to the game is very long and can bore some as there is no way to skip it, over-all I would recommend this game, the graphics are beautiful but has a lag/framerate problem.Video below!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYv248Rvb14"

The plot is interesting, it's is really something new, but there are some small technical problems, that I hope will be fixed in update: no option for vsync or antialiasing and somethimes annoying blur on the screen. Anyway, it's a unique game. I`m looking forward to a second part!"

Amazingly rich soundscape, and probably one of the more impressive games I've seen for a while for immersion. A few tricky puzzles to solve are always fun. Perhaps its biggest weakness is the inability to escape out of the cut scenes, which reduces its replayability, since you'd need to sit through them all again, and they are very long.Make up your own mind with this gameplay:https://youtu.be/UqI8K3P16pg"

The optimization is not so good, I have to play on medium settings and 40 fps, while in gta5 I can get 50+ fps on my system. But I really have fun. Indeed, this game is cool with its little details and new idea. Original gameplay, sounds are well amde and the story seems to be intresting."

Someone says we need a skip button, and it was immediately added. Someone says about mistakes in German localization, and it took just a few moments to fix. A lot of gamemakers should learn how to do this. I would buy this game even for 50$, just to support the devs. Great work! Respect!"
,Recommended,546700,29824100,Posted: 10 February,all,Jamyjet,"Instead of giving this game a positive review, I'm giving it a mixed one.As a fan of games of the genre I found it to be intriguing and atmospheric. For $5 it's pretty good value for money too, taking around and hour to beat with some optional achievements to go back for.On the other hand the game takes up a whopping 19GB of storage and for a game that takes about an hour to complete, that is pretty baffling and suggests to me the developers didn't know how to zip their game up properly.Another aspect that the game fails at, in my opinion, is story telling. It tells a forgetable yet convoluted plot, that I'm sure will be developed later in the subsequent episodes/chapters. The ending comes abruptly out of no where and left me scratching my head.In terms of gameplay, aside from walking around and exploring, you have to piece together events from the past to determine what has happened, most of this consists of multiple choice questions which was pretty boring and tedious for the most part. The other main gameplay element were circuit board puzzles, their might have been 2 in total, where you align some diodes to make the current flow from A to B.All in all the game has potential and I'm interested to see how the further chapters build on the foundation of the original entry, but if any of the things I mention put you off, you might want to wait until it drops in price. The developers have said they'll reduce the price of Chapter 1 when Chapter 2 drops later this month.If these problems don't bother you too much and you can spare $5, then go ahead and check it out."

,Not Recommended,546700,30860821,Posted: 31 March,all,Stubborn Puppet,"Rarely does one feel cheated out of $3 when it comes to buying a game (which was on an almost 50% discount), but Butterfly Sign was, in my opinion, not even worth the time I invested, much less the money.The glaring problems are everywhere:  bugs everywhere, even in the graphics settings menu, where most of the independent settings can be adjusted, but never actually are applied - automatically reverting afterwards.  The optimization of the game is terrible - providing choppy movement and awful framerates, even on a very high-end machine with graphics settings reduced into the potato range.  The controls are clunky and there is no option to reassign buttons - and if you choose to play with a controller, you'll find that text menus and puzzles still require you to put down the controller and use the mouse and keyboard.The game itself is also very... limited and amateur: weak premise, poor dialog, puzzles that arent' ""puzzling"" and is way too linear and constrained in a setting that seems to imply you should wander and ""detect""(cuz you are a detective).  The cut scenes are very slow to load and persistently tear the player from the game, interrupt the moment, load the player into a new environment/moment and convolute the story.To put a nail in the coffin, the whole of ""chapter 1"" lasts about 80 minutes... 40 minutes of which is spent wandering at a snail's pace down the path shown in fast motion the intro video on Steam.  And just as you feel like something of a story is taking shape... the chapter/game is over.  I literally felt absolutely dumped off and like I'd wasted time I'll never recover.There is no chance I'll bother with any further chapters of this."

Hoping epsiode 2 brings a little bit more."
,Recommended,546700,30394586,Posted: 8 March,all,Mr. Melk,"A graphically beautiful game and intriguing story. I really enjoyed playing this.Some minor things that trigger me as a game dev:- The music doesn't seem to follow the player, instead it emits from somewhere in the world, making it feel weird and makes it hard to get that really atmospheric feel that the game has a huge potential to do.- The ""shafts caster"" on the sun isn't aligned with the one in the skybox. This feels weird.- The intro might be a bit ""boring"" if you've played through it many times, as you don't really do anything else than walk. Also sprinting is disabled at some places, making it take even longer.Otherwise it's a pretty neat game and I recommend playing it despite those minor imperfections."

,Recommended,546700,30625244,Posted: 19 March,all,nd,"The very first thing you see when you get aquainted with a game is how beautiful it is. Game's built on Unreal engine 4 and the creators of it seem to have taken the maximum out of graphics engine - i was just astonished by how amazingly beautiful it is. The other side of all this beauty is the fact you are downloading 19Gb - yes, this is how much all this beauty takes space. If its ok while i'm home over a broadband connection, i'd not risk to download the game while travelling somewhere )The story is no less intriguing - you are playing a first person detective game, exploring the depth of your mind by taking some experimental drug.  Another great thing game promices a non-linear story, non-linear dialogues, non-linear timeline, where events take place both in past and in present - every component of a good game seems to be mixed thoroughly :)"
,Not Recommended,546700,30685744,Posted: 23 March,all,Manatierchen,"I played it because I was looking for an interesting detective game. I bought it on sale, which in hindsight was good, because I wouldn't pay full price for it (even though the full price is relatively cheap as well).The game itself looks nice, but it's really nothing special. I felt like I've played lots of games with a similar story before and the puzzles seemed familiar as well. I won't buy the second episode."

,Not Recommended,546700,35402871,Posted: 1 October,all,Taylem,"This will be a quick review. Why? Well, easy- this game has been seemingly abandoned by the developer and is an unfinished state. That being said, the first chapter has a nice little ambience to it, decent music ... but there are downsides aside from being very very boring.The voice acting is very bad. Movement is clumsy ... and the graphics look like stock assets from a development program.Much better games out there for the same cost.Avoid unless you manage to get as part of a bundle or free."

And you were there in the past, but you do not remember, that's why you introduced an experimental remedy for memory restoration, which was developed in the laboratory. The detective is just perfect, nothing superfluous.Conversations and dialogue on interesting.The graphics are good all is beautiful and gloomy, the details on the levels are elaborated. The puzzle is trivial but interesting.The atmosphere itself is extremely oppressive and is supplemented by good music.The game has Russian language, which will completely penetrate the plot and plunge into the game. Also there are elements of horror that are not pronounced, but deliver fear with their existence.Very interesting experience, I advise you to play."

Even with the game set on amature  [the easiest mode] the puzzels are timed. It means that if you do not solve them in time you have to start them all over again. This is unfair for those who want enjoy a relaxed playing.

,Not Recommended,546700,28407568,"Posted: 16 December, 2016",all,NortisZen,"Well, this is a first time that I am rating a game negatively. And it is not that I did not enjoy it, not at all. The game is really interesting (though has a common story going around still managed to pull me into playing it), the sounds could have been a bit better but I'm not complaining about that. The puzzles are quite interesting and definitely makes you think (and I enjoy these kind of games that puts you up with a challenge) and the atmosphere was set quite in a good way (maybe the only problem that I saw was that when you get to close to an edge of the map you will see the barrier but this is only my opinion). So you're probably asking ""what's the problem then?"" Well, the answer is simple, there is no doubt that one of the things that they put most attention to were graphics. Unreal engine 4 really makes it stand out! However, I think that exactly the engine or lack of knowledge when working with it made this experience rather ""eh"" than stand out with a strong ""wow!"". First of all, before buying the game I checked the requirements and even my hardware was supposed to run the game on at least medium settings with no fps loss. But apparently the requirements did not live up to the expectations (to be honest, I was quite surprised that the requirements were so low at all). So i bought it and after everything was ready I launched it. However, it would constantly crash on the loading screen. After an hour of desperate trying I finally made it work but then I started experiencing fps loss (at default my game was set on high but after setting it on low it started lagging even more!). I could have played the game at 30-40 fps, that was not a problem to me but then the game crashed again and again I had to play around with the settings for an hour after realizing that it was futile. Not mentioning the fact that the game was delayed a few days to fix variuos bugs and glitches. Overall, this game feels more like a beta version rather than a full release. It is supposed to be episodic (meaning you will have to buy different episodes of the game) and it only costs 5 euros. Plus, considering the fact that it is an indie game, I'd say that if you want to try, you could but I am not guaranteeing that the experience will be fun. That's the reason why I refunded it. Maybe after some fixes I might buy it again but who knows."
76561198376317844,Recommended,546700,32044078,Posted: 29 May,all,humblehero14,"Well, in order to remotely enjoy the game, you definitely have to meet the system requirements or you may have a blurry walking experience like I did even at the lowest settings.  I’m not all that tech savvy like many PC gamers, so I didn’t really understand even some of the basic requirements needed to play the game; however, when the price was at a big discount and my PC runs smoothly with big games like Fallout 4 and Hard Reset, I thought I can still run Butterfly Sign.  I was totally wrong.I won’t give a negative review based on my framerate problem throughout the game because that’s on me in the first place for not meeting the requirements, not the developers.In technical side of things, there isn’t much that I found buggy or broken with the game.I know that I have to rely on the keyboard and mouse because its partial controller support.  It’s already stated in the description.The loading screen needs to be changed with something “moving” like dot, dot, dot or a percentage load screen.  Having a picture with just the word saying ‘loading’ just wouldn’t cut it because gamers may interpret this as “frozen” especially if it loads for more than two minutes.The gameplay is simplewith two types of puzzles, one transportation and the other field detective work.  If you played many walking simulator games with mild puzzles, you can expect more of the same here.  Reading clues help understand the narrative.I wouldn’t go far to say as to “not recommend” the game because I don’t see many things broken but I would understand why gamers would be put-off by frame rate issues, simple gameplay and length of gameplay.It does enough to be a passable game due its use of Unreal Engine 4.  The videos and screenshots speak for themselves.  If you have the technical specs for this game and enjoyed games similar to its genre, it is still worth giving this game a go.  The asking price isn’t all that expensive."
