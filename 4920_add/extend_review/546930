It’s not!For a change, let’s start with all the positive things I’ve experienced while playing the game.I had no lags or stutters in my entire playtime.The modes that were added with todays patch (07.02.17) are fun for around 30mins.It's fun to shoot some robots with every gun available for some time. And you can enable extra options. like moon gravity, or that the enemys only move when you're moving.The game is from the same developer as Dinosaur Forest, and if you’ve played that game, you will notice this after starting the game up for the first time. Pretty much everything is the same from the ingame options to the gameplay. The only differences are the models of your guns and your enemy’s.The weapon sounds are “alright” and the best thing in the game in my opinion. Your character sounds like a pig that gets a kick when jumping; Sometimes you get stuck in invisible walls. The graphic is “okayish” I would say.What speaks against the developer of the game (in my opinion) is, that he as multiple games for sale that are in early access currently.The only selling point of the game is the it has 1106 easy to get Achievements for you to earn. And if I had to guess, I would argue that at least 98.5% of all people that bought the game (including me) bought it for the Achievements!If I had to do a honest conclusion about Machine Hunt here I would go with:Go into the woods and get a wooden stick. You’ll have more fun with the stick than you will have with this game.->Small Edit 08.02.17: Added something to ""positive"" things about the game."

And I wish I was joking.Well technically there is 2 maps, but the other map (which you see in the menu and loading screens) is only available once you suffer through to the 10th mission in the ""campaign"" if you can even call it that... and it's only available in the campaign. You can't select it in any other mode.If you have played ANY of the Devs other games, it's the exact same. Same weapons, same sounds, same graphics, same menus, same everything. This is basically a DLC from their other game Dinosaur Hunt, but made into it's own ""game"" and charge money for it again... except that their other games still contain more content then this.It's nothing but a sh*tty asset flip game that shoves 1000+ achievements and Steam Cards and tries to get sales.

,Recommended,546930,30177233,Posted: 25 February,all,Shrodu,"I know I'm gonna get some hate for this, but I'm going to recommendMachine Hunt.True,Machine Huntis an achievement booster and it lacks in variety (as in enemy types and levels), but I gain quite a bit of satisfaction of being an overpowered character that watches giant robots explode into pieces after a few shots.  Throwing raining achievements with that is just a bonus.The story is in short narrated increments with matching images to suit the scenario mentioned.  Though, what doesn't make sense is that in the story, you're a lone soldier (don't know why he's going solo...mercenary?) in a mech suit.  In-game you're clearly wearing a leather finger-less glove and a leather jacket.  Furthermore, your character appears to have a female voice...so there's an issue with consistency.  Additionally, the snow field (one of three levels, the others being what appears to be a desert motel/trailer park and a medieval castle area) is littered in idle non-enemy mechs that seem to serve no purpose...I've found myself mistakenly shooting them several times when I started, mistaking these decoys for enemy units.Machine Huntis far easier and less frustrating thanDinosaur Huntand is for the same low price of $1.  If you wanna be showered in achievements and giant mech parts raining from the sky, I'd say give this game a try.  Just keep in mind that there's an issue in variety and consistency.6/10  Probably the only game where you get to take down a giant mech with 3 shots from a pistol and watch its parts rain from the skies..."

The entire point of this game seems to be to drop ridiculous amounts of achievements very quickly. It's not fun, it's pretty pointless. The machines are extremely easy to kill, you basically have infinite ammo and multiple weapons available for you. Even the boss fights are pathetically easy."

,Not Recommended,546930,32569772,Posted: 19 June,all,Superior,Machine Hunt is a shooting game.+ Has robots- Repetitive- Bugs & lack of optimisation- Bad AI- Bad graphics.- Poorly balanced- No explanation- Gameplay- Achievements spam
,Not Recommended,546930,33645888,Posted: 18 July,all,Blade,"Oh man, another generic arena shooter from this developer. I think there's some sort of voice-acted story that goes to this, but honestly it's boring and doesn't make up for the gameplay whatsoever. There's no terrain detection for enemies, the little 2 foot tall robots can somehow climb 5 foot fences at the same speed at which they walk. Most gun animations consist of 3 frames repeated when reloading. There are no stats given for any of the weapons, and no text boxes or anything to give you an indication of what's on your HUD. Controls aren't covered, either. Maps are terribly bland, though better than the incredibly boring maps in the Dinosaur games by this developer due to how many generic assets they placed in it (none of which you can interact with).This developer has to be using an FPS Maker Studio without actually knowing much about coding or game design. Out of the four games the developer has released, they're all exactly the same just with different environments. And they're all now achievement spam games with trading cards because the dev knows how bad they are and needs some gimmick to get people to buy them. Maybe it's time to do something else?"

,Recommended,546930,30065029,Posted: 20 February,all,Birckk,"Worth it for the achievementsSo if you didn't know. The developer ""Racing Bros"" has made a series of games including this in which you are able to get thousands of achievements in mere hours. The achievements are made so that you'll get achievements from each kill, headshots and some standard achievements etc. All of these games are primarily the same with the exception of the opponents/enemies and maps. To everyone saying these games are good or bad let me state this. These games have a clear purpose and you are either against that purpose or not. The games are what they are, and aren't meant to be some AAA title or anything like that and are not made for the gameplay experience. These games are for having some fun with some bad physics and insane explosions when killing enemies. They aren't meant to be played for a very long time and that's really fair considering the really low price of these games and what the reason to play them are. All in all these games are solely for the achievements and maybe having a small laugh and that's why you should buy this game and nothing else. I personally found the games fun, and they did feel a little grindy of course but nothing I didn't like or mind.The game isn't much but shooting some robots for the achievements. The physics are janky and so forth but you should be able to have fun or relax until you've got the achievements."

Seriously dont bother with the rest. it makes the all weapon available to choose look stupid once you see these 3. They need to work on the weapon achieving mechanic's so its makes us having grinding time and some sweat to get it to make this game joyable .But to be honest, this game has potential if the developer isnt that goddamn lazy not putting up some good grind mechanics and also rework the map and the spawn, the enemy, the collision object.The game itself is laggy as hell, i dont know what wrong with the setting because i tried all of it, my computer is decent for today's heavy game. but wont do well whit this utter lazzy game.The enemy has no AI what so every, they just spawn in and will go to your location nomatter where you are, they will just run to you in a straight line right from their spawn point, and as i say they will just go thru up the wall  or any obstacle the maps has. Making running from them is useless and stupid.Tips : if you really want to waste your time, which i dont recommend (except for the achievement completion stuff), just run to the road end in the maps , and corner yourself, that way you wont get surrounded by clumsy rapid static robod enemy, and after you have to face the big robot on each map, you just have to aim their head with sniper rifle from afar, then after it gets near, blast him with Rapid shotgun to its face. EZ KILLthen, REPEAT. untill you puke. because there's no certain point playing the levels what so ever. Just GO GET THE ACHIEVEMENT , Then UNINSTALL !!! DONT BOTHER WITH IT ANYMORE.if youre a achievements lovers, just get the game, 1106 EZ Achievement is waiting for you.Generally speaking, since its still on early access, i gave the game a chance.But because its a paid game, it need to get at least a tiny bit decent content first before i can put a ""Thumbs Up"".RATE : 2.4 / 5 Stars"

The voice acting kinda suck becuse there are no expression of the situation (sorry for bad english) and there are only one art. Some of us want a game with a good storySecond: the map. The visual of the map made me confused on the location of the enemy.Third: looting. You have to look at the loot in order to obtain it. Sometimes i dont have time to look at it because enemy is nearbyFourth: the enemy. For the first round the enemy is boring because it's always the same♥♥♥♥♥♥(except for the final one)fifth: scope. When i tried to scope i dont know where im shooting (maybe it's just me)Lets take the negative aside and see the positives.Graphic: Works fine and no lagsConsept: It feels like borderland but you shoot at robotAnimation: Movement (walking and running) is already good and reloading is good(The animation is good for a really cheap game)Although there are more negatives on this list than the positives, I really want to like this game so do your best"

Don't blame me, they give me nothing to work with.A cheap♥♥♥♥♥asset flip with mindless action that's no fun to be a part of. It's garbage. Also, if you love achievements, you're in luck! You get an achievement for just about everything you do. Just lovely."
,Not Recommended,546930,31348794,Posted: 24 April,all,Kovic,"Probably the weakest game from this dev, but still decent enough to mess around with for 30 minutes and get a bunch of achievements.As with the other games from this dev, I played this on an old 15"" 4:3 monitor @ 1024x768 ... I did this because it just felt right with the quality the game possesses.  If I pretend it's 15 years ago, this game rocks.Anyways, buy it with the bundle for cheap when on-sale... no full price purchases for any game from this dev.Know what you're getting before buying it and don't complain after...there is more than enough info and reviews available to make an educated decision.  This game is nothing more than an achievement hunter special...1000+ within 20 minutes.  The novelty of community named achievements is weird, but interesting idea."
,Not Recommended,546930,34205404,Posted: 12 August,all,ToiletROCK,"A barely playable game with a truckton of spammy achievements.It is evident that there is minimal effort put into the game. The graphics are reminiscent of that from the Borderlands series; a bit like cel-shading but not. Most of the game uses this art style but for some odd reason, the robot enemies look more like 3D toys. They don't use the same art style and appear out of place. The foilage and trees aren't even colored and there's no variation among them. You can turn them on or off in the Options menu. The objects don't have proper collision or pathing coded into them. Most of the time, I see robots casually climbing a wall like it wasn't there. The character stats (the things about strength, sprint speed and stamina) don't have any observable effect on the game. You can sprint indefinitely, so as long as you hold down the SHIFT key. Apparently, your weapons use ammo but I don't know where to see how many bullets I have in my clip or my total stock left. There aren't much differences between each weapon. Each takes roughly the same amount of shots to kill an enemy. The robots have different collision sizes. Despite being the same enemy over and over each round, my bullets sometimes pass through certain parts of the robots and sometimes it hits. And the achievements. There isn't at least a description telling you how to get them. I literally got a few hundred by button mashing my keyboard."
