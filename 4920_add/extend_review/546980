,Not Recommended,546980,33022533,Posted: 29 June,all,jerrythelegend,"Did a quick blind playthrough of this game. Here's my review.Opened up the game. Title screen is just clouds and two buttons that say New Game and Load Game. Awful dubstep music is playing in the background. I'm not entirely sure whether or not it qualifies as ""music"", as it keeps glitching in and out and it's only like a 20-second loop of the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again.Okay, on to the actual game.Anime character in front of a photorealistic background. More of that freaking dubstep music. He's whining about how he has no friends and spends his days on his computer. You get to choose something, but to my knowledge it has no effect on the story no matter what choice you make.Okay, now he's in front of a computer and he got an email for a dating site. Apparently his first 3 months are free, as he got an invitation from a ""golden user"". Whoever made this game clearly has no grasp on the English language, as,, there; is... punctuation"""""" literally ?everywhere and no semblance of grammar.He's now signing up for this dating site, as he says it ""can't hurt"". It asks him for a lot of information, including his credit card number. He is visibly frustrated with this, and says ""Do they want my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥size too?"". Now clearly, this is the epitome of humor. I almost had a brain aneurysm from the sheer amount of laughter this clever little one-liner provided.After he signs up, he browses through the catalogue of potential dates. He mentions how they all look like actresses, though in reality they just look like characters you'd see on a waifu pillow. He comments on how well designed the site is, mentioning the gothic font and the ""flash design"". Did I mention the dubstep music is still playing? Yeah, it hasn't stopped yet.Okay, it just gave me another option. One of them was ""change music playlist"". I didn't even see the other one, because as soon as I saw ""change music"" I clicked on that one. Unfortunately, it didn't change jack♥♥♥♥♥♥and I'm still hearing the dubstep music.Now he's in a chat room on this dating site. He notices a member by the name of ?????, who asks him about the night sky. Apparently, this ????? person (whose name is actually Carmelia or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ knows him. She mentions how his surname (I forgot what it was) sounds like the name of a Roman sword. Also she says she hopes his personality is like that of a strong Roman sword and not a rusted one. I have no idea. I'm at a loss for words right now. This game is so unbelievably bad.So this Carmelia person logs off, and our main character (named Brandon) goes to sleep. Then he wakes up. The photorealistic background of his living room changes, but unfortunately, the music doesn't. He starts whining about how his life is boring and how depressed he is, and how he needs nicotine. I now have the option to make him stay at home and be lazy, or go out and get smokes. I'm gonna have him get smokes just because it sounds more interesting.Whoa, the music changed. And it's somehow worse. More dubstep, just more earrapey this time. Okay, now he's in front of a painting of a city. He's saying how he doesn't like that people are staring at him, so he puts in earbuds.. And now he's back at his house. What a cutscene. So interesting. More of him talking, just gonna skip through this because I don't really care and I want to finish this game so I can stop writing this review.He got another email from our mysterious friend Carmelia. She mentions a bunch of stupid crap about the weather before asking him to get a tattoo from some dude. He doesn't want to. Every other word is ""what the hell"", ""damn"", or ""crap"". Like the creator wanted to be a little edgy, but not TOO edgy.i cant play this anymoreDon't play this game, it's not even fun as a ""so bad it's good"" type of game. It's complete garbage, waste of 49 cents."

This one seemed interesting in the description, and the price seemed more then fair.I was dead wrong.    This game is one of the biggest scams I've seen yet on Steam.  Have a look yourself (if you dare) at my first play and review...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgYLKbQUi6Q0% Score. - Less then 5 minutes of content to anyone reading this themselves and making every choice route.Lame writing, Horrifying grammar, and god awful visual novel.  This isn't a visual novel, this is utter garbage and asking any amount of money for this is like asking someone to pay money to get punched in the face."

It took 20 minutes to play (watch mostly) the current content. I received one card toward a badge. There are no achievements at present.The protagonist is named Brandon. He's depressed. He complains about being depressed. He complains a lot about being depressed. Maybe you're not sure how often he mentions he's depressed. It's a lot. Brandon recieves an invite to a dating site. Three months free. He meets a woman there who offers him money and asks him to get a tatoo. At this point we're not sure if it really is a woman. It's just a name on a screen you assume is a woman. The content ends.I'm going to rate this game ""No"" for now because the story isn't well paced or developed. Maybe it'll get better."

,Not Recommended,546980,31302395,Posted: 22 April,all,Tialoc,"Spelling errors, repetitive annoying music you have to mute, a depressing story still as of 4/22/17. Chapters released VERY slowly that add little content. Fun to try and read out loud though. Honestly though, this would probably make an interesting book, but not an interactive story, choices you make effect the plot and microscopic ways too. So basically if you like kindles with one sentence on a page, slightly humorous animated people expressions and the song that plays, then get this ""game"". If not then I recommend you look onward at games like Buried, if you want an interactive story that is."

,Not Recommended,546980,30339326,Posted: 5 March,all,Sopetip,"Ok so I litterally played 13 min and finished the game wtf. ok so : The art is ugly. Like amateur hentai ugly. The music makes you want to hang yourself in like 12sec. I thought it was bugged the 2 first min. The story sucks. basically its a guy complaining about his life for 10 min then 3 min of a girl texting to him. And it's over. IN THE MIDDLE OF A ♥♥♥♥IN DIALOG. He's like ""oh my life is sh*t and what is that sms?"" BOOM, END OF GAME, BACK TO MAIN SCREEN. No ""the end"" or ""Game over"", nothing. Oh, maybe there's more to it but it crashed because it was coded with fingertoes. I don't know, but I dont want to play this♥♥♥♥♥♥game longer. (I payed 10 cents for it and i feel like somebody robbed me)"

,Not Recommended,546980,30950406,Posted: 4 April,all,Нюбайт *gurka.se,"I bought this for 0.10 Euro hoping that I would get that money back through trading cards.It seems like that isn't happening, looking at their price.Oh, you want to hear about the game? Artwork that both would need more quality and quantity, story to do nothing but bore you, and to top it all; spelling error o' plenty, just to suck out what little value this game could have.Verdict: Don't buy. Not even ironically. You're better off just buying its trading cards instead of getting them from the game if you just want the XP. (you can do that, right?)"

The art is very bad, there are no choices, and the music can hardly be called such. Edgy diolouge is spread out through many clicks, making progression through the game tedious. The game itself was boring, but it could be interesting if it ever comes out of beta."
