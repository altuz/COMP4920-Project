A very simple base mechanic is used in interesting ways that make you scratch your head. Judging from the level select screen, I think it'll take me about 3-4 hours to beat it, which is good value for a $5 puzzle game. I would definately recommend it, especially if you enjoyed games like Hexcells."

,Recommended,547050,26707822,"Posted: 19 November, 2016",all,aramina,"This is a great little logic-based puzzle game. My one complaint is that after the initial intro it doesn't really explain what the various symbols mean in later levels, which means that you're kind of stuck clicking randomly for a little while until it ""clicks."" That said, the puzzles are quite well designed and I found the whole game to be a very enjoyable experience.Obviously it's not for everyone, and some people will balk at spending even 5 dollars on a game that will probably only last you a few hours at most, but I thought it was well worth it."

The puzzles have a gradual learning curve, with new mechanics introduced for each new puzzle area.It took me three hours to solve it 100% and it didn't get boring along the way but kept on intriguing me. Very good value for a price of 5€."
,Recommended,547050,31694256,Posted: 11 May,all,Mothra,"I found this game as a follow-up recommendation to Hexcells that can likely be seen in many of the other reviews nearby. Having finished both games, I will echo that endorsement. RYB is even better than Hexcells, actually. The rules change more drastically as new elements are introduced; there's more variety. It's a shame more people haven't heard of this."

The mechanics are simple and the design too.I expect of what's shown from the video preview and yet it is in the game.10/10 would play for more, especially if additional puzzles are possible to add."

As you can see in the screenshots, it has a bold, colourful visual syle.New ideas are introduced gradually as you work through the puzzles so that it never becomes boring. All of the puzzles are handmade and each one is interesting.I love that there are no timers or scores.There is a good amount of content and challange to make this well worth buying. If you like step-by-step logical puzzles (eg Hexcells) then I would definitely recommend this to you."

I had it open for less than 5 minutes and the first level got me cracking a smile, and again every time they reveal a new mechanic. Intuitively satisfying. The interface is elegant and the gameplay is rewarding. Wear headphones for some intense ASMR: you will feel like you've entered a sacred realm of pure blissful geometry. Looking forward to user submitted content or DLC. I can't believe The Witness costs $40 compared to this.A steal at $5. Get it or regret it."

76561197989960659,Not Recommended,547050,33575169,Posted: 15 July,all,Author-Man,"It always feels really good when you hit that moment when playing a puzzle game where you've got it, you've figured it out, and everything falls into place one after another. this game has the opposite feeling; I solve a puzzle, but mostly feel frustrated because I'm not really sure why that's the solution.At first, when the game is introducing just the basic rules, it does a good enough job at teaching-by-doing. but as the rules get more complicated. it starts to do a worse job of it. I have completed the ""white circle"" themed area but have no idea what those circles mean - it was all just brute force and guesswork on my part. and even in areas with rules I understand I feel like the game's just not giving me enough specific information to solve the puzzles. The Witness tried a similar thing, and failed for a similar reason - it's very easy to either not understand what the game is trying to teach you, or to get the wrong lesson from the tutorials only to suddenly be confronted with that lesson not applying in the actual game.I feel like the game would have benefited from sacrificing the aesthetic for a more specific tutorial. perhaps give the player the option to turn it off and figure out the rules on their own. as it is, it's too easy to just not figure out what the game wants you to do, and from there there's nothing stopping you from giving up and brute forcing the answer - maybe let the player make incorrect inputs. colour a block blue that's supposed to be green, and when you get to the end of the puzzle just don't progress the game until the player figures out where he went wrong? I dunno, just shooting in the dark here.I really do wanna like this game. it's got a good aesthetic and it's a good game to play in the background while doing other things. but it just ultimately fails as a puzzle game. it's close, but not quite there. The logic is unclear and poorly communicated compared to other puzzle games on steam. I'll just go back to playing that one picross game i bought for basically the same purpose that does a much better job of fulfiling that purpose."

However, at some point later on, you will make a move that is perfectly valid, and makes complete logical sense; yet it is wrong, because later on in the puzzle, things don't line up. This would be fine, except there is no way to tell if a perfectly valid move your about to make, is actually perfectly valid because of some future puzzle piece you'll unlock if you solved a different part oif the puzzle first.In other words: The design and mechanics are solid and good, breath of fresh air even; but the puzzle design is infuriatingly inconsistant."
,Not Recommended,547050,29759527,Posted: 7 February,all,MechMK1,"I really love puzzle games, but either I have not found out how to deduct which beginning move is valid, or the game failed to explain it to me. Perhaps I am just supposed to trial-and-error my way through it. Either way, once multi-color (orange) puzzles are involved, the puzzles get way too complicated for me"

,Recommended,547050,31296274,Posted: 22 April,all,MarblesSaysHi,"Enjoyed the game a lot and would definitely recommend it - especially given the low price.I really liked the aesthetics and the elegance of the game: step by step increasing difficulty and implementing new mechanics without the need to give written instructions. Thought process wise, it feels like an elaborate version of a mixture of Sudoku and Minesweeper. So if you enjoy these games or enjoy puzzles in general, you should get the game.I also really liked that there was no timer or score involved. It was only about the intriguing puzzles.It took me 3-4 hours to complete the entire game and while it is not the longest game, it is still well worth the price.Small comment: A puzzle resets if you make 3 mistakes; so in theory, you could simply brute force the solution by trying all possible answers. Make sure to not go for that route because it will simply ruin the fun. Try to always think until you are sure you are making the correct move, since the game has no mechanic to punish this trial and error behavior.So once again: I had a lot of fun playing this.Thanks!PS: Also check out the YouTube Channel ""FLEB"" where the developer of this game showcases different puzzles."

,Recommended,547050,32907737,Posted: 27 June,all,DoctorXOR,"Great puzzle game. Hope that it can expand; the new ideas in each set are really clever and I think they deserve to be drawn out a bit more. In particular, the last level was much too easy, and tons of levels could be designed using everything thrown together, including the secondary color set.Will definitely keep an eye on this game and any other work the devs put out. Mentally stimulating, yet relaxing. It enters the same category as the Witness: simple puzzles with complex solutions."

,Recommended,547050,29063818,Posted: 6 January,all,Sahara X.,"Fun little puzzle game in the same vein as Hexcells, minimalist and completely logic-based. Each level allows three mistakes before forcing you to start over, which can make it too easy since the puzzles tend to be fairly small. This means you can kinda brute-force your way through if you don't have the patience to figure out the logic behind the level. My biggest complaint is that I wish it had built to something more grand/difficult at the end, the final puzzle was really anti-climatic."

I couldn't stop playing until I finished it, which took me about 2 hours, and it was a bit easier than I expected. There is no real build up of difficulty as you progress, but new mechanics are introduced with new levels and it's incredibly fun to figure out how they work. I would have loved some bigger, more challenging puzzles that combined all of the mechanics. You get 3 mistakes with each puzzle before it resets, so it might be tempting to go the trial-and-error route when you get stuck, but this will ruin the game for you! Having to sit back and analyze the puzzle until you see something new is a great part of the fun."

,Recommended,547050,34804460,Posted: 7 September,all,BravoZulu,"Fun little puzzler, only a few hours long, but a good logic workout. If you ever have to guess you've missed something. As is the fashion, concepts are introduced wordlessly with a few simple training puzzles, then you're in for the real ones in each section.  If you've learned the correct rules from the training puzzles (pay careful attention to these), then it's just a matter of deduction to solve that section. Any confusion will probably stem from having ""learned"" a slightly incorrect version of the rule, and in this way it reminds me a lot of The Witness, though the games are not otherwise similar."
,Recommended,547050,35399099,Posted: 1 October,all,jumpinator,A great abstract puzzle game. Many different challenges keep the puzzles unique. There is only one little issue: Some of the tutorials were more confusing than helpful (especially the one with the white circles). But all in all a nice way to spend some time puzzleing ;)
