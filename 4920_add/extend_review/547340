,Recommended,547340,32302170,Posted: 9 June,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"I enjoyed the concept, about the goddesses starting to live among humans. The whole “idol” thing was okay too, but I guess I’m not a big fan of these kind of stories… Even so, I liked Divinity Stage and it was fun to read.This visual novel is mostly kinetic (no choices, you only read) and there’s only one time that you have to make a choice; and that choice will lead you to one of the three love interest routes. There’s a “common route” that will soon finish before your choice, meaning that your next playthroughs will be quicker since you’ll probably skip a lot of text. But the good thing is that each route is different and you can see the point of view of each one of the girls about the idol career. There are some repeated scenes, but nothing that will bother you too much (at least it didn’t bother me). The art style is really cute, and the BGM is very energetic. I also enjoyed the fact that Yamato (the MC) actually has a face in the CGs. lol7/10. It’s worth getting this title if it’s on sale and if you feel like reading a simple love story.(with some lewd scenes lol)"
76561198006413390,Recommended,547340,29709059,Posted: 4 February,all,woosk,"This second visual novel from PULLTOP and MoeNovel is a cute, funny and heartwarming fairytale romantic comedy with fanservice in a modern Japanese setting about three goddesses who have descended into Japanese society as singers/dancers/entertainers to draw Sakimitama (good hearts and good will of humanity) from their human fans and supporters. The story feature a male protagonist Yamato Tatsumi who is the heir to a tailor business. Having known Sara Benzaiten, the center singer lead in the popular idol group L☆SEVEN who is a regular at Tatsumi's tailoring shop, Yamato came to know Shuri Kisshouten, a wannabe street performer at Akihabara and Kagura Amauzu, a dancer and waitress at Goddess Cafe Goddess Kaguyama one day when Shuri and Kagura came to Tatsumi's shop for advice on idol outfits along with an ambitious plan to improve and promote their singing/dancing/entertainment career among other goddesses to audition for a place in the idol group L☆SEVEN, a center member position Sara intends to vacate.Having played through and completed all routes in PULLTOP and MoeNovel's first visual novel on SteamIf My Heart Had Wings(IFHHW), although this visual novel is considerably shorter than IFHHW, with considerably fewer main and supporting characters, text and dialogue to bring out each character in detail and only one choice to make in the entire game which automatically lead to one of three possible routes and endings (Less than 10 hours altogether to complete all 3 routes and endings), it is not necessarily worse than IFHHW, as the average duration of a Japanese TV drama is about 50 minutes each episode and I usually cannot keep my attention at reading through a visual novel for longer than an hour during each play session. A lot of attention and hard work has been placed into developing this visual novel in the form of animated sprites on each of the main female characters for a visual novel and there are also a total of 4 soundtracks with vocals and instrumental only versions in this visual novel and the soundtrack DLC which is twice the number in IFHHW and most of the soundtracks available in the soundtrack DLC are as great as the soundtrack DLC in IFHHW.Overall, this visual novel and soundtrack DLC are highly recommended together with IFHHW and its soundtrack DLC when in bundle offer. I would also highly recommend IFHHW, two of my friends niX and Dan in Steam have written comprehensive reviews on IFHHW, their respective reviews can be found below:http://steamcommunity.com/id/ch0colatemilk/recommended/326480/http://steamcommunity.com/id/dandk/recommended/326480/"
,Recommended,547340,30548567,Posted: 16 March,all,DragYn,"Short answer is yes, I recommend LoveKami.  But, as usual, there are some stipulations.LoveKami is a relatively short (just a few hours to complete all 3 routes), light-hearted VN about japanese goddesses who want to become pop idols.  While technically there is a choice, it's essentially a kinteic novel as your only real choice is in which girl to pursue (though TBH, the game doesn't make it clear that's what's happening at the time).  It's cheery, it's flirty, it's silly, it's fun, it's vibrant, it's quick, it's colorful and it's sexy . . . ish.  Okay, there's some risque CGs and dialogue - and a fair amount of cleavage and panty shots.The VN utilizes the Emote system, so the main characters (other than you) are animated and fully voiced (in Japanese).  I love this aspect as it helps the characters feel more vital and alive.  No, I don't speak Japanese, but I love having the voices and especially the facial changes in more than simple still shots.  The CGs and the sprites are all well-done and professional.  My only complaint here is the lack of variety in the . . . um . . . chestular region.  Let's just say the goddesses are all ""blessed"".  A little too much if you ask me.  But if that's your thing, more power to you!The story itself feels a little bland, and a lot rushed.  I enjoyed it, but I honestly wished they'd taken more time developing the relationships after the common route ends.  It's as if your character wakes up one day after being friends and just decides he's actualy in love with goddess X, Y or Z.  Of course, she's never thought about it, and when she does - surprise! - she's also into him.  It's all a bit forced.  There's truthfully not enough time to fully flesh out each goddess and make the reader feel an actual connection with them.  They're pretty flat (except the aforementioned chesticular area) and somewhat unremarkable.  Yes, each has their quasi-unique ""quirk"", but that's about it.  They're all cute and sexy, of course (assuming you can feel that way about animated women), but they need more.There are achievements if that's important to you, and they're all easy to get.  You simply go through the story in each route and unlock the vast majority.  The ones that are completed outside the story are simply for opening certain menus in the game.  Very simple 100%.All-in-all, I still enjoyed the game time, and don't regret paying for the game.  I did get it on sale, and would suggest doing the same. $13 isn't absurd, but I'd try to get it below $10 at the very least. My game time got a little padded with a couple brief AFKs, and I didn't always wait for voice-overs to finish before clicking to the next screen, so my guess is the 6-7 hours of total gametime is about right.  I'm sure you could get through it in far less, or take your time and stretch it out a little longer."

The plot is simple short and not really addictive, nothing special, I think that main character was too simple here. Music was quite good matched here so that is +. I like to play this kind of short vn sometimes but after so many arousing scenes leaving it without any nudity patch is cruel. This game is nothing special with full of half-naked (or more) scenes without any good plot, so i see no point why it shouldn't have one simple patch.------------+ good music+ sometimes it is nice to play short novel+ I liked Sara attitude---------------- too big boobs- simple plot, nothing special- Main character wasn't great here- it doesn't have nudity patch-------------------+/- It has a lot of pervy scenes!"

76561198069159152,Recommended,547340,30401396,Posted: 8 March,all,wrb41977,"This striking visual novel is an interesting product. Dealing with a world where the gods of Japan have sent pieces of themselves (basically avatars) down to earth to learn about the human world. They are here to learn about human culture and emotions. One of the largest power sources they have are the devotion of humans, which gives them the ability to create magical effects. And the easiest way, at least in Japan where they've landed is by becoming Idols.There are three romanceable individuals. Two are aspiring idols who are working to win a competition to join the top idol group. The third is the center of that group. Each of the paths is beautiful and with there only being one choice in the VN, it is easy to pursue who you want.All in all, a fun little game. Though it appears it might also be part of a world of another game that is Japan-exclusive."
76561198316723661,Recommended,547340,28432350,"Posted: 17 December, 2016",all,Otaku-sama,"While I recommend this game and enjoyed it, I do have issues with it. First, I played If My Heart Had Wings, and so I was expecting an extensive game such as that. The ""Engrish"" if that game wasn't really present in this game, so that is a plus. However, in IMHHW, I was able to overlook it due to how much there was to the story. Another issue is the etchi factor. For a game to have so much visual stimuli, it takes away from the appeal when it isn't actually put to effect(i.e. H-Scenes) Granted, this is on Steam so I didn't expect to see anything, and it would need time for a patch to be made like with IMHHW, so my opinion on this isn't set in stone. Honestly, having played IMHHW, the length of this game feels more like a demo than a full game. There was only a single option too, which is good if you really just want to make sure you get on the route of the heroine you want, but being a new release, I was really pumped by the idea that I wouldn't have any access to walkthroughs, so I was going to have to discover the routes myself. The single choice was a big letdown in that regard. All in all, while good, this game gives me the impression that it was released before it was truly ready."

,Recommended,547340,30290982,Posted: 2 March,all,MaraviaX,"Pros:- Visually appealing. There is both stills and light animation which work well together.- Interesting spin on an oft used storyline.- Heartwarming stories- Excellent soundtrack- Voice actingCons:- Length is about 5-6 hours to complete all routes if you save right before the route selection.- Only one 'choice'. This is essentially a 3-path kinetic novel, where the lone choice decides which of the three branches of the story you will read.- Story is predictable and cliché at times (still heartwarming none the less).Score - 8/10This is a very good visual novel.  The visuals are stunning, the story is cute, and the voice acting and soundtrack are well done. The biggest problem I have with this visual novel has nothing to do with LoveKami itself, but its creator. Pulltop/MoeNovel are also responsible for another visual novel, which I rank among the best visual novels ever created. Because of this, LoveKami (for me anyways), was completely overshadowed by its sibling, and thus its reception (again, by me) was disappointing. I will repeat, I did not dislike this visual novel. However, if you are going into this after playing 'If My Heart Had Wings', and expecting the same kind of emotional connections to characters, story and character development, or overall complexity and length of the story, you'll find yourself sorely mistaken. I just did not feel emotionally invested in these characters, at least not to the same degree as I did in their other novel. I also completed LoveKami to 100% within about 5 hours, with a single route taking about 3 hours. The same feat in IMHHW took about 35 hours. I could go on and on about the differences between these two visual novels, but that would not be fair to this novel or its creator, and it doesn’t change the fact that I would recommend this novel to anyone. However, I want to make it clear what you will be getting, and what you will not be getting."
,Recommended,547340,30644115,Posted: 20 March,all,Darkcoin,"LoveKami is adorable but short novel. Playing it was a lot of fun. Only thing that can disappoint you is it's length, 10 hours at best. There is one more thing, you get only one choise that will determine your route. Still if you're looking for visual novel and u beat IMHHW this is second best i found."
,Recommended,547340,30450612,Posted: 11 March,all,MaxDDF,"A short, but touching story with 3 paths to choose from. 'LoveKami -Divinity Stage' is about the offspring of gods, kown as godesses (there all female) coming down to earth and living with humans. you play as the main charactor that has the responsibility of getting 2 godesses in to the top ranks of idols, see the diffrence in the 3 girls personalities and watch them grow to be better idols and gain a place with the legendary 'L Seven'. I highly recomend to anyone looking for a sweet story lasting about 5-6 hours long (with all 3 story lines) with beautiful charactors bursting with personality and charm. 10/10, would definitely play again for the 3 diffrent endings. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did."

So, choose your waifu and enjoy the... oh, damn. There aren't 18+ scenes :(Well, it was expected since we are on steam and the novel is very short.But anyway, the voice acting (there is voice acting in a short novel. MARVELOUS!) is very nice. The girls are ♥♥♥♥ing adorable.The soundtracks are really funny and the idols' songs are played during the game, so you can pause during the reading and listen to those.Not to mention that computer graphics is god tier.I'm not ashamed to say that I got so many boners while I was reading.Well, maybe I should be ashamed...I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing useless person with no morals.But I've got waifus, so who cares?Definitely recommended.

Being so short has its pros and cons, as its a smaller time commitment, but there's not as much time for developing the characters and their relationships. Overall, however, I felt like it struck quite a nice balance and nothing felt too empty or left out.

But this is going to be a biased opinion on this and what this VN hasn't got in comparison to the far superior -If my heart had wings-.-A lot Shorter than IMHHW.-Doesn't have much reply value (but that's my opinion).-In comparison to IMHHW, this has a little too much fan service when it comes to more explicit scenes and this isn't really con nor a pro but it is also a lot more revealing than IMHHW.-Hasn't really got a memorable story other than ""date her or her"" but of course they somehow tie in a okay story.-Less choices on who you favour most when it comes to the romance.-Less dialogue options.-Not a very intersting array of characters.-End rating 5/10.*Additional note*So I recommend you purchase ""If my heart has wings"" because it offers more than than this product, however though the creators who made this are talented and can make quality products and you should keep an eye on what they are working on if you're interested. However they as of late are producing quick VN's that doesn't come close to IMHHW which has more dialogue, a better story and a more interesting cast of characters.What doesn't help is that the creators ""Pulltop"" have set that bar incredibly high with their first VN ""If my heart had wings"" that some people including myself want more of their original work."
