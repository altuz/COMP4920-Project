So, how do you ♥♥♥♥ it up? I'll tell you, They took nearly all the cars, removed the ingame money, then hid them all behind a dlc wall. Not only that but the packs are WAY too over priced for what you get. If it was 5 to 4 dollars i could live with it but 9 to 7 for packs that add 3 to 4 cars is a rip off. Your better off saving your money for something else. Shame as this game had potential then they just let greed take over development and now we get this.UPDATE 3/4/2017Boy how money hungry are they? Not only are they making the dlc packs over priced but now there is a deluxe edition? Lol what? Alright then gather around everyone we are going to do a bit of math.They have reduced the price to 9 dollars for the base game. Then we have 4 dlcs, all over priced as they give nothing that would demand the price they are at now. With tax and such its 10+9+7+6+5. That equals 37 dollars for base game and all dlc separately. All together with the scam pack and its 23 dollars. This is still a giant rip off. For both prices your still getting next to nothing for content, drift phyics from what feels like a game from 2005, mediocre graphics and sound effects and zero online gameplay(Sorry peak angle ghosts of players on the track with you doesn't count as multiplayer). Your better off buying assetto corsa with the japan car pack then modding it. Sure it may be more expensive but trust me you will get far more enjoyment from that then this."

Not only will you have endless server connection issues but it takes forever to make some real in-game money & ""free experience"". Of course even when you try to message the developers via email or the game forums you will not get any responses at all. They will take your money & ride off into the sunset.Although if you enjoy drifting in any of the Need For Speed games (Except for Shift) then this is the game for you.

Of course sometimes you'd want to waste 20-30 minutes and accidentally waste an hour and a half, but it's not a game you can just binge play. In any case, the physics are simple enough, the game countersteers for you. It's  a simple to learn, difficult to master type deal. For physics download the demo it'll tell you everything you need to know.Note - not all cars have changeable bodykits, not all bodykits can be bought with in game currency (which is VERY difficult to win in daily challenges). Same goes for wings and wheels. On that note it's not pay to win. The multiplayer aspect is... well as far as I figured it out you play against ghost replays of other people online, which is a good way to exclude lobbies, lag, griefing, and many proper online problems. On the other hand it's not really online, but I do not care much about that. All in all is it worth 12 eur? Well, you decide, at first I thought not, then I got into it and I thought ""yes, probably it will be a good value for money, since it will bring a ton of playtime over time"""

,Recommended,547410,28823207,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,Process All Data Boi,"Any other PC drifting games with low-to-med spec requirements?I don't think so.Pros:+ Very nice drifting physics+ Quite a lot of cars, many still in development though+ Not Pay2win+ Vinyl system encourages creativity and allows you to replicate real life liveries (although with fictional aftermarket logos)+ You compete against other people's ghost record = no lag, no sync error, you can pause mid-match+ Money farming isn't tedious and slow+ Car customization: body kits, rims, spoilers, vinyls and decals+ Fine tuning option is one of the best and most complete among lots of racing games.+ Perfect for both casual drift players and hardcore drift enthusiasts+ You can play this using keyboard (now, think about how many drifting games impossible to play on keyboard.. and then there's Peak Angle, which is comfy on keyboard!)Cons:- You compete against other people's ghost record = not 100% multiplayer, but hey, I'll still take it- No car performance downgrade feature (yet).- Many of the cars still don't have customizable body kits (many visual models are still in development, so this makes sense).Controversial topic:The developers have recently decided to put three-quarter of the total car amount into DLCs. Now, before everyone goes crazy, I'd like to inform that all players who have accumulated over 500.000 Credits (Cr) at any point of their gameplay get free access to all DLCs; they can buy the cars in-game without having to purchase the DLCs.On the other hand, new players who buy the game after the DLC update are left with only 7 cars. Although this game is not pay-to-win at all, this renders all newer players unable to collect cars without buying DLCs.However, are the DLCs worth the money? While most people will answer ""No"", I leave the answer to all of you. One DLC contains 2 to 4 cars, some even with a body-kit set unlock. Surely, if a player likes the content of a DLC, they will definitely buy it. But, with the price of the DLCs right now? I can say that most people will choose other games, and I agree. However, this is due to the fact that many of the game's cars are still in development.Therefore, I can conclude that this DLC implementation is rather too early as the game itself still doesn't have enough cars.Conclusion:A perfect drift game for both casual and drift enthusiasts. Although the game is still in development, it is really good in terms of physics and customization. If you don't have a really beefy PC but want a nice and non-demanding drifting game, you should really consider picking this one up.NOTE:After the Version 205 update, the game connection might've been bugged a bit. At the moment, players might experience an issue in profile saving.However, FEAR NOT! The devs are the kind that listen to the players! They're active on the forum and take suggestions, as well as answer players' questions. Additionally, they always try to provide solutions to players' problems."

It was so good to drift with my x360 controller that I became a real fan.The cars are well modeled and tuning (visual&engine etc) is great in this game. In the fine tuning section you have more options than you have in Forza Motorsport. The drifting handling physics are very good, as for an arcade racing game. The music of this game also got my approval sticker.Yet it still has some downsides, which are hopefully fixed in order to make this game even better. The gravity seems to be out of place, if your car lifts from the ground, it feels like you're in moon, and the car easily flips because of that. Also not all the cars are finished yet.A BIG ++++ to this game for having a FREE 48-HOUR DEMO, which gives you a taste of things to come.TL;DR: Try the demo and see for yourself."

This is NOT a simulation by anymeans, however if your not too worried about realistic physics it is great to just enjoy the slide. I use an xbox one elite controller and programmed button configs very easily. I would however like to say the sounds and music get very repetitive, the skid marks never change tone or pitch, and are so loud that i had to adjust them a little to hear the engine more. I did this and then realized the cars do not sound great, but is a great start to better sounds in the game. On a side note, is it just me or is there no turbo or supercharger sounds? as i cannot hear them whatsoever. The cars sound a little like same clip of a V8 with pitch and tone changes for each car. I would love to see modding support for sounds and cars down the line. This title does seem addictive with what it has already. If the peak angle team listens to the community and keeps providing new cars and solid updates like they've been, it will be a solid arcade drifter. I cannot stress the word ARCADE enough."
,Recommended,547410,27547320,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,Shin,"I'm recomending this because the gameplay is there, but the game...hopefully will get there at some point.First the bad:This game is not complete and should have been released under Early Access. Feature incomplete games should never be marketted as full releases. This is just my opinion.Supported graphics lists a minimum of a GT 430 - but Intel HD4000-5000 in the supported chipsets. Based on this I expected decent performance on low out of an AMD A10-7300 R6 equipped APU, which is comparable to the Intel 4000-5000 and often superior.I did not get it. The game performs at 15-25fps on low settings. This is disapointing, since it really shouldn't.That aside, the gameplay is fine. It's a nice arcade drifting game. The progression could probably use a little more balancing but it's not that bad. I don't like the car research/buy system or multiple currency cancer from mobile centric gamedesign but it's not a dealbreaker since the game is actually FUN to play.And based on it being FUN to play I have to reccomend it. But if you expect 60fps on a potato, you're not going to get it. Hopefully a better graphics setting menu or optimization is coming in the future to give some merit to the claimed IGP support.Still... probably the best drifting MMO going at the moment. Has a super sexy S13 knock-off model that will probably take eight million hours to unlock ;-;"

Then found out that it wasn't really multiplayer. When I hit escape to adjust something I noticed the game had  paused. So I did it again and checked time left, well, it was exactly the same as when I hit escape, even though I let about 20 seconds go by.Then I kind of stopped playing it.So recently I came back and they have done an update!! I was hoping that maybe they got multiplayer implemented finally, or maybe that they had finished more car skins or something cool.No.. They didn't really do anything cool other than add  1 more car skin on a premium car at the end of the list that some d-bag youtuber reviewed. They also added all of the cars that were purchasable with paid currency into DLC packages when most of that♥♥♥♥♥♥is not even complete. they are literally boxes on wheels driving around.

Firstly, why the ♥♥♥♥ would you not have mouse control in the menus? doing anything in the menus of this game is on the verge of physically painful.Moving on, the game already fails as a sim on three key points. The lack of cockpit view, the lack of TrackIR support, and the extremely arcadey car handling. The game is very in-depth with its customization, but it hides micro transaction behind the paid entry. I don't know how easy it is to make the currency through gameplay, but the fact that there's micro transactions while also asking for an upfront fee, already puts me off.It also gave my PC an aneurysm, locking everything at 100% and bringing it dangerously close to overheat protection, even though my specs are well within recommended.TLDR - Not actually a sim, and trying to use the menus makes me want to drink bleach."

As other people have stated, it's not ""real-time"" multiplayer at all. You're racing replays.Original ReviewPlease ignore the 8 minute play time. I had my fair share of play time when it was free to play from their website. I played until it didn't let me anymore.Add support for multiple controllers. My pedals, wheel and gear shifter are all separete controllers. The game is fun but if you have a setup that isn't one single piece, you won't be able to play. It doesn't even recognize my wheel. It only recognizes my pedals.I have a Microsoft Sidewinder FFB Wheel. Yes it's an older wheel, but I paid ten bucks for it and it works like a champ with every other racing game I own.My pedals and shifter are both Thrustmaster. I plan on getting a wheel so I can just plug in one controller but I still feel like it should be pretty easy to detect all the controllers and just let the user map from whatever controller they want. Several other racing games support this and it would be extremely helpful to a lot of people.Another pretty big gripe I have is that you always ask if we want to buy credits when we try to close the game? I just bought this game. It's not f2p yet you still try to run it like one. STOP. It's going to put a sour taste in everybody's mouth if you continue to shove this micro-transaction nonsense down our throats.I hesitantly click the recommend button for this one. Only because the underlying game mechanics are smooth and enjoyable and if you are a keyboard or gamepad user then you'll probably really like this game. If you don't have a single controller for all your sim-driving needs, you'll be disappointed like me. When they add support for multiple controllers, I'll be entirely happy with this game."
