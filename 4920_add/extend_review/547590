,Recommended,547590,29703211,Posted: 4 February,all,Qix,"I must start by saying I like pinball video games, but I've always found Pinball FX2 a bit boring by comparison with The Pinball Arcade. Although the VR version of Pinball FX2 is the same game, it somehow feels more authentic. I don't know if they changed something or not, but suddenly the ball moves and sounds more like a real pinball table with extra toys and special effects. Standing over the virtual table, you know it's virtual, but it looks much like a real table.In terms of the VR experience, it is perfectly suited to everyone's space because unlike most other VR games, you can stand or sit still and you don't have to wave your arms around as you would for a shooting game. Even the menu is controlled by head tracking. I think standing makes a big difference to the experience, but adjusting the viewing angle is not very precise and you can end up with neck ache from looking down at the flippers.Unfortunately, as with the regular Pinball FX2, the tables still seem too easy and sometimes you are defeated by tiredness rather than a lack of skill as a game turns into a marathon session where the ball is saved over and over again. I guess that would count in the game's favour if you are a pinball novice. Still, I enjoyed playing the game a great deal and I would play the VR version now in preference to playing it on screen.I would definitely recommend Pinball FX2 VR to pinball fans and VR enthusiasts alike. The VR version is making me like Pinball FX2 more than before and it didn't leave me feeling motion-sick like some VR games do."
,Recommended,547590,33410623,Posted: 9 July,all,"David ""TheDave"" Eastwick","Pinball FX2 VR -This is how pinball games SHOULD be played!I am going to start this review with one simply thing, if you do not have VR (and i mean one of the big vr kits not the mobile phone thing) then this review is not for you, i know you are tempted to call VR a gimmick, to downvote/dislike etc as i say it is how it should be played, resist try the game in VR.Ok so i have been a Zen Pinball fan for many years (Zen? But this is FX2!.... Well on the ps3 then ps4 it was called zen pinball)I owned most of the ps3 tables and when the ps4 came out i was able to import them, I confess i was a little annoyed when i downloaded the pc version and could not import my tables! So on the ps4 i own ...well nearly all of them if i am honest, these are really really well made tables!Sadly on the VR version there is only a tiny selection of tables and no sign that we will get any more. This does include the awesome Epic Quest table though. It was annoying that the tables had to be re-brought (those i own on the ps4) but i was willing to do so to help support the developers.ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT / GRAPHICSYou can have 3 tables active in the room space at any one time, however this is largely academic as you will only ever be playing one at a time (even if they let you play all three at once i doubt you have enough arms!) this does seem to be a disappointment to some and i confess i do not understand why (again i am only in possession of two arms and one head so perhaps those with multiple of them want to play more than one at once?)The area you play in is done well and you have easy access to the menu and leaderboards, what is really cool is that each table comes with props that float and animate around you while you play, the animations on the tables are also really well done and translate well into VR (i so want to play the portal table or see what they come up with for the deadpool table in VR...one can dream)PERFORMANCEI had no issues at all and there is plenty of options to tailor the game to your machines specifications, i have heard people bemoaning the performance but as i say it worked great for me and since this is my review…..no performance issues.There is a bug that is unrelated to performance, and more a “why the hell have they not fixed this yet thing” - The tables are very low which means when you stand your looking down a lot, not comfy with the vive and easily fixed with a height slider (Their community manager actually said to stand a stool or chair, reset the position then jump down…..proving that sometimes people just do not think, personally when blindfolded by the vive i avoid climbing on chairs, perhaps that makes me a coward lol) I did find though that being sat and loading the game seemed to put it at the right height for me to play sat down.INTUITIVENESSIt is pinball, you hit the ball with the flippers and scream at it when it jumps down the whole at the bottom. Can not get much more intuitive than that. The controls are clearly displayed on your wands too.MULTIPLAYER:It has leaderboards, i for one like beating my mates scores (on the ps4 i am top dog on every table i own :) among my mates).PROS:The pinball tables are exceptionally well done.The animations around the table are very cool and add a good atmosphere (and amusement).Pinball in VR works really well, i do not think i can go back to flatscreen pinball now (annoying as i have £100+ worth of tables over the years on the ps4)CONS:Seems abandoned by the developers, no additional tables or important bugfixes.Fx3 is coming out soon and has no VR, this is a bad sign for FX2 VR.VERDICTGetting it shows the developers that VR pinball is something we want to see more off, but only get it if you are happy to keep it how it is (for the content available now it is not cheap but worth it)I am deeply displeased that the company has all but abandoned VR and i really hope they do a U-Turn on Fx3 and add VR support, i certainly will not buy any FX3 content while they avoid VR,i just can not go back to playing it flatscreen, the ability to see the whole table makes playing it just so much more enjoyable. As the only VR pinball table game i have played (are there others?) and ignoring the fact the company has, as i say, all but abandoned us, i do recommend it, most highly."

Knew I'd end up buying this edition to play on my HTC Vive and glad I did.Visually its as good as it gets in VR right now. I'm playing it (again..on the Vive) on a i7-6700k ()overclocked to 4.6ghz) and a 980 ti Waterforce (stock speed) with no super sampling and it looks great. Looks a little better with SS turned on but I rarely need it on my rig.  Motion controller support is ""ok"" (mostly due to the Oculus involment in this game early on) but it works well enough for the purposes of a pinball game.The stock tables are ok but I find the DLC tables are more interesting and fun. A lot of this is to do with enviroment as I really do like how each unique table changes the enviroment (though seriously..screw the walking dead table). You play the Mars table...you're on Mars. Play the Western table...you're in the Wild west..etc etc (again..screw you walking dead table).However with the enviroment comes a complaint. You can only ever have 3 tables equiped at any time. Whilst I acknowledge you can only play one table at a time, it is a bit of an annoyance to keep swapping out the table in the set up menu. We could do with a better system. I'd suggest a larger ""home"" enviroment that allows all tables to be equiped at the same time....but I guess that would mean the devs would have to know exactly how many tables they plan to release over time.Playing in VR is the closest thing to owning a real table. I just hope they add some of my favourite tables (the Star Wars + Marvel ones) soon since there is no way I can go back to playing on a normal monitor now.Certainly worth buying if you have any pinball and have a capable headset."

,Recommended,547590,31929250,Posted: 23 May,all,arleas,"I have to say that this is one of those games that really benefit from the jump to VR.  You could totally play these games without being in VR, but if you've ever spent any time in an arcade or a bar, or wherever you might find a pinball machine in real life, there's no real substitute for playing it the way it was meant to be played.My only regret in FX2 VR is that you can't actually feel the glass, metal and plastic of the pinball machine as you play.  You're still somewhat detached from the whole thing since you don't feel the flipper buttons under your fingers and you don't nudge the table by actually moving.  Still though, you can follow the action without having to rely on the game following the ball, and everything looks as realistic as you would expect a real pinball machine to look.Pros:you can easily see the whole table without relying on the screen shifting to show the action.it's the closest you'll get to actually owning a pinball table without actually having to buy one.Cons:They've got some stuff set up around you as you play that's kinda distracting.No multiplayer.As an example of the distractions, there's one pinball game where a hot chick is standing off to the side (though they always make them way too thin) and you're trying to concentrate on the table and she's standing there talking. It's neat and all, but I imagine it would be cooler for friends watching you play.It'd be cool if you could invite someone to play, and then they could download a demo of the table in question and join me for a game or two, or otherwise allow other people to join in (like if they had the 2D version of the game, you could show a virtual version of them playing).  That would be awesome."

76561197968546721,Recommended,547590,28456125,"Posted: 18 December, 2016",all,ElectricZ,"It's pinball in VR. What else do you need to know? If you like pinball on the PC but have always felt it was a flat experience even with 3D rendering and wished it could be more, the VR version makes it happen. It's about the closest you can get to having an on-demand real-life pinball machine.The graphics and gameplay are excellent but the VR sells it. Once you get the viewing angle right, it's like standing over a real pinball machine. One concern I had from the videos was all of the thematic animation outside of the table. I actually kind of like them. They're fun but not too distracting, and while playing I'm concentrating so much on the ball I hardly know them. They're not a selling point but they're not a detraction.The three tables that come with the game are fun and varied. I've bought a lot of expansion tables for this series on the Playstation over the years, but only a handful have been converted to VR as of yet. The price per table is kind of steep. I've only bitten the bullet and bought one expansion, Walking Dead and though it was pricey, I really enjoyed it. I'm not sure yet if I'll buy the other expansion pack since it's more expensive than the game and I'm not yet tired of the tables i have, but again I have to say I feel I've gotten my money's worth for what I've bought.Basically, if you like pinball and have a VR HMD, you'll have a blast with this one.

There are more themes but they only seem to be available in the paid DLC (Season 1 Pack) for the game which gives you 5 more themes for 24.99 USD (at the time of this review). I bought both the game and the ""Season 1 Pack"" DLC, all of which, in my opinion, are well worth it. Each theme is so immervise and detailed as well as the tables themselves having tons of cool things and detail that I'm thankful I took a chance on this game and bought it.Just to be clear, even if you don't by the DLC the base game and its 3 table themes are more than enough to get your money's worth out of it. It feels great to sit down and have some casual Pinball sessions and if you like to be competitive there's ""leader boards"" in the game too.Finally, I only have 48 minutes or so into this game, but those have been 48 minutes of immersive fun, and I can tell I will get many more hours, days and weeks worth of playtime in the future."

76561198080940407,Recommended,547590,34261194,Posted: 15 August,all,teluan,"THIS IS THE FUTURE OF PINBALL!!! Best pinball experience to date, less a few issues that once corrected overtime will truly make this incredible!!!Pros:- With the low latency of VR, the table feels real time with no perceivable delays. FINALLY!!!- Feels like you are standing (or sitting) in front of a real pinball table.- Graphics, especially the lighting is very impressive.- Sounds are spot on.- Tables have cool animations and elements just not possible on a real table which are cool.Cons:- You will desire more resolution as the back or the table is rather pixelated. Playable for sure, but visually less real that you would want which breaks immersion for me at times. Not a Con for the game but rather a con for VR as a whole right now. Cannot wait for VR to get to 8k +.- The animation on the outside of the table is very annoying and distracting.- No matter how many times I calibrated my system, the floor in the game was always ~6-8"" lower than the floor in my actually room.  I even have the floor fix add on and while SteamVR home is spot on, the floor in the game is always off.  Other games do not have this issue and nor did this game when I first purchased.  Very frustrating as I feel too tall when I play which is distracting and weird feeling. Come on Zen, fix this please.- The A, B, X, Y buttons mapped to the Vive's trackpad are utterly ridiculous. For instance, if you go to click A at the bottom and feel the bottom edge of the trackpad with your finger and press, nothing happens.  Why? Well the A button is about 2mm above the edge and thus must press there.  So silly as the A button should just extend to the edge. This needs to be fixed.- The 3 included tables are slow. Pinball tables in the real world have different speeds and I tend to prefer the faster ones, but this game all 3 are painfully slow most of the time."

I would spend hours playing if not for that and would scream past my most played Vive games in terms of time played. But that is more due to the poorl designed Vive than it is to do with the game.

76561198041447747,Recommended,547590,30724133,Posted: 25 March,all,Ned Ragdnuos,"Thanks for such an awesome game! It works fine on GTX Titan cards, smooth motion. The playfield is a lot easier to see and understand now, love how amazingly colorful it is with the OLED display, similar to the fun of playing on the PS Vita. Learning how to setup the HTV Vive headset took some time. I needed to update the firmware over USB on the LightBoxes to get them to shutdown when Steam VR exits, as well as install the bluetooth driver and update them over bluetooth too. Also, I needed to update to the latest nVidia drivers to get the HTC Vive to run in Direct Mode, before doing that it seemed like it was not working properly at all, just displaying a copy of the desktop, unusable as far as I could see. Anyways, once Direct Mode drivers were installed and working, everything was fine. Far exceeded any expectations I had for this system. Pinball FX2 VR is a must-buy, it's amazing how many tables are working already. The HTC Vive controller support still needs a little work, as it seems that there's no way to accurately control the plunger e.g. as needed for the skillshots to get the Wisdom upgrade in Biolab, so for now I've still been using the wired XBOX ONE controller. It'd be great to be able to fully use the HTC Vive controllers, though, as they're two separate controllers, one for each hand. I was having the occasional 3-second black screen when using a 15ft DisplayPort cable, but after switching to a 15ft HDMI Monster cable, all is working fine, so I can have the PC 15 ft away from the HTC link box, keeping the main area nice and quiet for gaming. There's also a headphone port at the back of the headset, and in-ear headphones are provided that are very convenient and sound fine. Having some easy way to control the volume in-game could be helpful, at the moment adjusting the volume is kinda awkward. My system is usually setup for nVidia Surround, so if I click on the overlapping squares menu button on the HTC controller to use the Steam virtual interface and view the PC desktop that way from within the headset, all of the icons are very tiny indeed, barely usable. Still, minor inconvenience. Love the sunrise, the way the sunbeams come in and light up the game room is very well done. The latest nVidia 378.92 driver still seems kinda buggy, because if I click to enable stereoscopic 3D (for playing ordinary Pinball FX2 in 3D Vision, which is awesome too), the entire system works fine only until the next reboot, at which point nothing works until I reinstall the nVidia driver again. Scary! The best driver for 3D VISION on GTX Titan seems to be the old 327.23 and I'd been using it up until March 2017 completely successfully. Sadly, it doesn't have ""Direct Mode"" support, hence the need to update to the newer 378.92 driver. Well, perhaps nVidia will fix the driver some day, it's very puzzling why rebooting doesn't get the system back to a clean state if I enable stereoscopic 3D, and the 378.92 driver needs to be reinstalled. Overall, it's amazing fun to play this, and to see the beautiful Zen tables really coming to life. Your work on this is really appreciated! Oh, by the way, the menus for the game are too ""HUGE"" when running the game in 3D Vision Surround on three monitors, it'd be great if you could render the menus in 1920x1080 rather than in 6000x1080."

I'd considered buying arcade buttons to make a controller so it feels like I'm playing a real table, but using the Vive controllers is satisfying enough! All the tables play well, as long as you know how to activate the features ;)It's not perfect though, for the sake of adding value Zen have added in some 3D objects that float around the table and react to different features etc. it's a nice idea but a bit distracting and the option to turn them off would be welcome. Being in a 3D modelled environment but not being able to walk/teleport around the space is a bit 'flatscreen', I was quite surprised that I could only move to specific places, making the play space simply a menu which loses the immersion a bit. Also it's not set in an arcade or a bar, which is pretty much the only places I've ever seen pinball machines...The tables are good to play though which is the main thing, if you enjoy pinball either real or simulated, you will enjoy playing this! :)"

The tables ( have all of them) are well laid out and fun.My only real complaint is the room setup.  I purchased all of the tables, but the room only holds 3 tables at a time. If you want to play other ones, you have to go to the menu screen (TV in the middle of the room) and replace a table in the room with one that you want.  I would rather just have them all in a room and have the ability to go from table to table. If this can't be done, I wish the programmers would add another room if needed.

I could watch those machines for hours. c) Watch someone else play in vr (recordings of best scores?) - I also loved it as kid. d) Setting your height. I have my pinball love since... you guessed - I was a kid. Now the default setting for gameplay is from adult perspective. Right now I can stand up, reset the view and sit down (on HTC Vive) to simulate the kid perspective but hey... this should be in game! :DAnyway - the feeling of 'home arcade' is there, but I would also like different environments - like a real arcade room.Maybe even add some licensed old games, like GnG or Pacman in virtual environment?

Once I was above the floor, another time I was sunken in, and my controllers never feel like they're where my hands are. This only happens in the main menu strangely enough, the rest of the game is relatively bug-free. If you're a developer reading this, I would highly reccommend that this be a priority fix if it's a wide-spread issue as it made a very bad first impression. If it's just me, I'll try wiping my save and reinstalling.With that out of the way, I can say that if you were looking for VR pinball, this is the game you probably want. The physics feel right, and if you buy the season pass, you will have a nice variety of machines to choose from. Unfortunately, the base game only includes 3 tables, which I felt was a bit too few for the price. The season pass isn't really optional in this case if you want a game that you'll come back to.Recommended for pinball lovers. Get it on sale if you only casually enjoy pinball. Be prepared to buy the season pass.(Played on HTC Vive with slightly underpowered processor)"

It seems though that Zen Studios have redeemed themselves with this awesome VR implementation. The tables come alive in VR. If you're playing the underwater table, you are literally under water... with sharks and other fish around you and even some research subs. Now this doesn't really change the table itself, but it enhances the experience in a way only VR can do right. This does mean that you won't be getting any previously bought dlc, but when you play the machines, you know why. Fortunately Zen Studios are releasing more tables, just like they did with the non-VR version (get the game free/cheap, make money on dlc.... which I personally think is a great business model). The base game in VR is not free like the non-VR version, but with 15 euro, it does deliver more than enough content (compared to other VR games).The controls are very intuitive, the setting (rooms) is nice and little details (like the door that opens (as an exit) when you look at it) are well executed.Here's to hoping that more tables will be released soon (like many others, I'm hoping for those Bethesda tables), but I don't worry since the first licensed table has already been released (Telltale's Walking Dead).Well done Zen Studios!"

The only real issue that I have is that it is kind of blurry when standing over it (not their fault- it is due to the resolution of the Vive), so i opt to stand up, adjust the table, and then sit down so I have a better view.One cool aspect of this game is that the tables kind of ""come alive"", and the theme of the game you are playing plays out around you.  For example, when playing the underwater table, you will see sea life swim around you as you play.

My 13 year old and I played it together. Just like old school pinball, we took turns trying to get a high score while figuring out the actual gameplay of the board (it's difficult to read the digital pinball scoreboard while playing to maximize scoring without losing the ball). My son now understands the joy of actually “playing” pinball. He thought it was only about mashing flippers. The physics are extremely accurate and the gameplay is very in-depth. I have heard others complain about the “looking down factor”, which we resolved by jumping up while resetting the screen location (I highly recommend). It would be better if the player could adjust the height programmatically. I would also like to see a better spectator mode on the computer monitor, similar to “Job Simulator”.

I sit down get comfortable.  Hold my HMD exactly arms length above my head, reaching for the ceiling.  Press X on the controller to reset the view.Put the HMD back on and it's like you're inside of the pinball machine.  (or using view 5 or 6)  And you're looking UP for the mostpart with less strain on your neck.  And I can get highscores for LONG periods of time.  NOT STANDING and feeling like crap.  Take my advice or suffice.I get close and the ball looks a little small.  So I IMAGINE a way to SCALE EVERYTHING UP a little bit bigger.Or make the table the size of my YARD!!!I saw Bio Lab and Earth Defense and said to myself, It's a must-have!I'm probably one of the biggest Pinball FX2 fans out here.  I owned most of the tables on Xbox 360 and a bunch on PC.  The Xbox 360 version had Multiplayer AND Split-Screen!   PC had NEITHER!!!  Huge downfall.  But now I see.   We have VR now, those guys don't.Pinball FX always had really detailed tables.  You would DREAM to own these tables or even an arcade.  I wish a bar had amazing tables like these.  If real life pinball wizards don't like Pinball FX it's because the tables make their favorite RL tables look like carboard boxes.   NOW in VR you can see ALL the details that most newcomers wouldn't even notice.  Now EVERYBODY sees why I like this game so much.I also notice that little knob on the right side of the VIVE that changes your eye distance.  Puting it to the LOWEST (61mm i think) and really close objects are SHARP.  I used to think 67-69mm was good, but it's not.I remember back when I bought an HD LED projector and pointed it 90"" on my wall.  First game I played was Pinball FX2.  My friends thought it was crazy, of ALL GAMES, I was playing a Pinball game on the new projector!I have a GTX 980 so the best I can run this game is HIGH textures @ 2X MSAA  (sadly, I can't handle Ultra.

VR brings a whole new, and amazing immersion to pinball games.It doesn't feel like playing a pinball video game, it truly feels like playing real pinball.  Wow.My favourite VR purchases so far.  Highly recommended for anybody with VR who enjoys (or might enjoy) pinball.I used to own a real pinball, and now have a custom cocktail arcade machine (with pinball controls on the side) that plays the regular version of FX2.  That is very good, but this simply blows it away.  The 'pinball arcade machine' is a great pinball video game.,,, but this truly feels like owning and playing REAL pinball machines.   Amazing.Cons?  I've heard that some people have problems with fps.  I haven't, so can't really comment on that.   I'm running a 1070, which seems to do fine.    There isn't an option to turn off the animated backgrounds while playing (at least I don't think there is) -  the devs may want to consider that -  a bit less atmospheric immersion, but likely better frame rates.My only other (possible) issue, is that the 3 games that come with the base game seem too easy.  Part of the joy of pinball is to 'learn' the table... that used to take many (many) quarters.  My very 1st game of Epic Quest took about 30 minutes, and put me in 2nd place overall on the leaderboard (I know it's early, but still).  After that, I'm not sure how much I want to keep playing EQ, if it going to take that long each time.  Pinball should take a few minutes and only 30 once you become a 'pro'.    Maybe I just go really lucky, and the other 2 tables do seem better.   I'd love to see some real world tabes, or some more of the licensed DLC (the Star Wars tables, please :-)3 games included in the base game, for the quality and price... no issues.   Day 1 DLC?  I think that's fine for this type of experience (you're paying for 3, and can buy more if you like.  It doesn't take away from the experience of the 3).   It would be nice if there was a single table free demo, but Steam return policy makes it easy to try without risk.I thought I was going to enjoy FX2 in VR, but it is much better than I expected.
