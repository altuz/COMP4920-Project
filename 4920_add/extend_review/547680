,Recommended,547680,30095211,Posted: 22 February,all,kẅrty,"Guild Questis an enjoyable and surprisingly addicting cute little time waster, in the vein of ""Clicker"" games but not quite one itself, you could call it an Idling game rather.It starts off pretty easy in the first few areas, but by the time you get to island 4 or 5 you will start to have those longer wait times for your money to build up. I think it's great that each island has multiple achievements for building on it meaning that as they add more islands the achievements just keep coming. The game itself hasn't been out for a month yet but it's got a really solid foundation and I think it could grow to become pretty great for this sort of game. The devs have been very active constantly integrating helpful features in to Guild Quest as well which is great to see in Early Access. I really hope that this can keep up as the game gets further into EA.For the time being I think updating the resolution on most of the textures and all of the text is needed as at the moment it looks a little too low res. I think with higher res texturing it could just look cleaner all-round.Overall a really solid game that has at least a dozen hours of playtime and counting for me personally, and for anyone who hunts achievements or just really enjoys this sort of game, probably many countless more. I would recommend this to anyone, even if you don't like this kind of game, which would normally stick to mobile, you can still whittle away some time playing this and enjoy doing so."

My concern is that I spend more time not playing than getting on and spending some gold, and getting back off. Progression is rather slow without paying. The tutorial doesn't really explain a lot of the way things work. The game itself isn't rewarding at all. At least so far. This doesn't mean I hate the game. It definintely has potential and I'll continue playing to get a better idea of it. The time I've invested so far has been okay, but could be improved."

It's essentially one of those games you install on your phone and only play for a couple weeks, max: it's a little addictive at first, when you're low level and can progress quickly, but then you lose interest and realise you're not missing out on much if you don't play. There really isn't much to do.EDIT: Because people seem to think I haven't clocked — I am aware this is an early access game. I'm not an idiot. I gave feedback on what I'd seen."

You get units, upgrades and other content at random from boxes. It doesn't have transmute yet, but that's because it probably just released to steam now.Overall it's an okay idle game and I like this one over others.

It's less about active playing however, there's no clicking or anything like that whatsoever, so you'll basically find yourself building something, upgrading a few things and then turning off the game for a few hours to come back and repeat the same thing, but hey, that's basically what idle games are all about.If you like to just click a few times and watch how everything grows on it's own, then this game is for you."

76561198032829178,Not Recommended,547680,29690287,Posted: 4 February,all,GenghisRon,"The core concept is entertaining,but it's literally putting the game behind a pay wall way too aggresively. Sometimes games like clicker heroes eventually make it so that you need to grind a week to advance,but that's after unlocking several heroes. That's also in a game where there's a lot you can do to maximize your effeciency and have options to make your grind to the end game faster. Guild quest took only an hour to put me behind a wall and it does everything it can to try and entice me to throw it a few bones. But not because its a fantastic game and one I'd like to support. No it's so I don't have to wait 4 hours for my next round of scrapps...I mean free chests."

,Recommended,547680,29886669,Posted: 12 February,all,King Maff,"Pros:- Doesnt need constant maintenance to complete the game- Generally fun and challenging- Once you hit a certain point, you really just need to sit back and waitCons:- Once you hit a certain point, ALL you do is sit back and wait- Late game is all a waiting game. At one point, it will cost a few BILLION to upgrade somethingTips:- Set up the fourth island as a money farm. Max it out with exploration quests and just let the money come in.- COMPLETE ISLAND 8 BEFORE ISLAND 7. This may sound strange, but its actually cheaper to fully upgrade island 8. Island 8 also can become a VERY GOOD money farm.- Once you unlock the achievement for maxing an Island, you can destroy and rebuild quests at level 1. You will be able to use less guardians at that point per island, allowing you to move and build on the new islands without running out of guardians.- log on ATLEAST once every 12 hours. This allows you to collect your chests from the bosses. Each chest does have a small chance to give you an additional guardian."
,Recommended,547680,29751705,Posted: 6 February,all,Eythen,IF you're looking for a game with little management this is the game for you.As one who spends most of his time writing I do need to take breaks but can't get side tracked for too long.Guild quest provides the nessesary 3-5 minute break I need. It doesn't require intensive brain power to know what needs to get done and I can keep it up without it getting in the way of my work.Overall if you're looking for a game that can idle in the back ground while still give you the feeling of progress this is a good game to invest a tiny bit of your time in during the day.

,Not Recommended,547680,29641395,Posted: 1 February,all,Tye,"In a stupidly small amount of time I can say I am fully disappointed with this game as I perceived it to be something much different. I assumed this to be a game where you could make the quests, not just click on some already-system fixated quest and have your ""guildians"" do it. I was hoping you could name your quests and actually build your levels and even maybe bosses or something. On top of that, I am already bored and I only have 7 minutes.. that should tell you something right there. The game concept is unique but focuses so much on grinding its not even really a game as much as a chore. You really don't have any fun doing the grind either, as you're only getting cards/gold in the process which really doesn't help anything other than help you grind some more, which is well, self explanatory of why that is a failure in its on.I highly recommend you don't bother downloading this until major changes release (if at all which is likely as this is just in early access, so don't get to up-tight. There is still a chance for a future progression here!)"

Although the gameplay can be improved, by relying less to AFK to progress and without AFK, the game progresses really slowly (ofcorse you can pay money to speed it up). Possibly adding a speed upgrade? Maybe it would break the game balance.  The game has frequent updates. Overall I would reccomend it. Good job devs!

It goes far beyond pay for convenience and even beyond pay to win (if you can really win at an idling game) and straight to pay wall.  Very early you will completely stop progressing unless you spend money on shop chests.  They give you one for free to see just how big a difference it is from the normal free chests and the difference makes the free chests feel completely pointless.Fresh take on an old concept, but too limited in variation and hits the pay wall way too early."

,Not Recommended,547680,29576382,Posted: 29 January,all,x2Madda,"Guild Quest fails at the first hurdle when it comes to clicker games because there is no clicking to be done.Yes there are things that need to be clicked on, just like any video game but clicker/idle games are supposed to be about clicking (or botting, lets be real) until you reach a point where you have meaningful choices to make and Guild Quest doesn't have any choices to make.As an idle game lets be frank that any game can qualify as an idle game if you leave it running without playing it but as a game that rewards you when you leave and then come back, it just doesn't. Well it does, because you get gold but when its time to ""play"" the game there is little for you to do. Spend your gold then log back out again so if you are a fan of idle game then this isn't for you and if you are a fan of regular games then their is some fun to be had, similar to My Life as King on the Wii but you are waiting for gold to come in so you can do more things and obtaining gold requires you to do nothing at all and therefore you may as well stop playing.The game itself does nothing wrong, its not offensive and the graphics have a charm to them being doodles with a crayon look going for it and its free with a cash shop thrown in because of course there is but I am reviewing this game based on the genre it belongs too and that is an idle clicker game which in that regard it fails. If I review it as a regular video game then it reviews better but because you are still left with large moments of literally nothing to do it falls down there too.I hope something changes, either the game allows a more active playstyle (which i would prefer) or it becomes a true idle game complete with world reset, multipliers and all the things we have come to expect from idle games because as of right now it fails to be either type of game.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews"

I like the cencept a lot...but I feel like the UI needs some fine tuning. I feel the layout could be more appealing...for a while I was having trouble remembering to click on the ""area"" i want to upgrade rather than the area's name.I am alright with a slow moving idle game, but this one feels almost too slow.  As contradictory as this sounds, this should be plenty of stuff for me to do before going idle.  In this game, once I set everything up there is nothing left but to wait.It is just missing some additional feature (trading, crafting, collectibles of some sort) to give it an additional hook before it stands out in the crowd."
,Not Recommended,547680,29836299,Posted: 10 February,all,Raymond,"Guild Quest Review - Raymond KTIt's fun enough as idle/clicker type games go. An interesting thing to keep in the background. The pay walls and the way they're worked into the game is more than a little greedy, but who doesn't do that these days. Hard to recommend at present though for one reason: There isn't a mass buy.Leave it running on it's own for a few days without opening, come back to an astronomical amount of money and rather be able to click a single button to communicate your intention to max out upgrades on individual things, you have to hold down a purchase button. The pace that this 'fast' purchase leaves you sometimes spending chunks of time anytime you open the game to actually spend the money you've earned. I wouldn’t recommend this game because it’s just another cliché quest game. Like the stick of truth except not funny."

I even put this game on my wishlist when I saw it on workshop. Boy I was so wrongTLDR version :The point of the game is build guild halls that produce workers (adv, fighter, mage, etc) on an island and let them walk around solving quests.Long version :You, the guildmaster, have to develop economy on an island by building guild halls and develop quests to gain money. The workers from the hall (adventurer, fighter, etc) will travel on predefined quest route until Boss Quest that unlocks the next island. But here's the deal:to unlock next quest you have to level the previous quest until a certain leveleach worker took a long time to spawn (40-90 seconds)each guild hall have a limit on how many workers they have (default is usually 1 worker)To raise the level of quest you need moneyTo raise the spawn rate you need moneyTo raise the worker limit you need moneyThere's no resource managementThere's no adventureThere's no RPThere's no storylineYou just need to come to an island, build a guild hall or two, build a few quest, and pray so maybe tommorow you will be able to scrap some money to upgrade the hall or the questidea RATING : 9/10 (unique concept)artwork RATING : 10/10 (artwork is great)execution RATING : -10/10 (an idle game with paywall)PS: please excuse my English-------------------------------EDITTED------------------------------after the 17/02/2016 update now you can PRESTIGE your island.""What's a prestige?""it basically RESET one of your island except boss quest so you can START OVER AGAIN with INCREASED DIFFICULTYsuch a creative and original development.that's it!

I actually play this game when i am out of homework, out of online friends, out of online players from friends or out of internet (or, out of good games). And there are a lot of stupid things. Like the animations. There's almost no working in animations. There are stickman (noob animation) things that are moving with a very big speed (but they aren't actually running) and they are fighting things. When they are fighting, the bar is teleporting in lower. No animation in that. And the game has absolutly no song and when someone (i mean, the guide) is talking, there are just words appearing. No voices, no sound effects in that. And, saving takes 10 seconds. What kind of game of 10MB has a saving system like that?!

This game is alot of fun with its cartoon style that reminds me of doodling on my math homework and adventuring through dumb quests in any RPG grind.  An idle/clicker game that is all about questing. With a guild house on an island you choose between what guild houses you have avaiable ( Explorer, Fighter, Mage, Cleric, Knight, Thief, Dark Knight and Bard) and set them up on the island. With you guildeons guild house set up, they go off to complete quests in an order and either fight or explore to bring back exp or gold for you! Each class has its own stats and does things diffrently and sometimes have their own abilties. At the end of the quest line, like any good quest line you have a boss quest to finish. YAY, thats about it...but you unlock more and more islands to put more guild houses on, that unlock more quest lines..and so on and so forth! Each boss also gives you a chest. LOOT. and each chest either gives you gold or gems, ( that level up your guild houses or quests) or cards. CARDS? well, yes interestingly enough a neat equipment thing to your guildeons is the cards. You can equip to them to increase certain stats for that guildeons type. Kinda like gear, but just a card that buffs certain guildeons stats to help them quest better. Sometimes you get cards to help your exp or gold income from quests too. Upgrading quests and guild houses does increase output from them of more gold/gems and exp. The typical upgrade thing. Exp just unlocks more islands or more guild houses.  The music isnt annoying and like I said , its all about the fun doodling cartooning and watching your guildeons fight off doodle ghosts and skeletons and whatnot. Fun to have in the background and just reading the quest names sometimes is a good chuckle. For the D&D fan in you."

There is one major problem though. It is almost requiring me to pay money because I simply do not have enough guildians. Otherwise the game is really fun."

76561198361548038,Recommended,547680,29745584,Posted: 6 February,all,backstagecoffee,"This is a great game to play with for a bit and leave alone. I feel like it's made for tablets but works great with mouse and keyboard.I am glad I bought the starter pack for $5 because it allowed me to really gain momentum fast and really see early on how the mechanics of the game play out. I also like supporting developers who make quality software.I like this game because when I come home from work I cant just jump straight into some intense game, so I ease into my evening with this game, and check and see whats been happening with my money while I was gone.Also, this has nothing to do with Guild Quest, and I'm just going to throw this in here, especially since it's a free game; Steam's refund policy is the sexiest thing I have ever seen. Also, I love the Steam community and everyone who is making games. You've got people like Hyper Hippo games which is comprised of people who spent time learning how to code and develop software. Then you've got a comunity on Steam who spend countless hours playing games and reviewing them and supporting the devopers in this big, happy sexy symbiosis. Thank you all for being awesome :)tl:dr; Play it. Steam is great. So are you."

76561198126730478,Recommended,547680,29810444,Posted: 9 February,all,BionicBunny7890,Guild Quest Beta is a fun game for any casual player of games like Clash of Clans or Game of War: Fire Age. The graphics and artistic design are appealing to the eye and the blend of cell shaded 3-D is a perfect touch. Overall I'm really looking forward to the final version of Guild Quest. 9/10.
,Recommended,547680,29795666,Posted: 8 February,all,uberwitcher,I like it. Some minor changes are needed. The must have is a scalable buy button: +1 / +10 / +100 / MAX. It takes a lot of time to upgrade quests. Anyways I love this game ;)
76561198067950264,Recommended,547680,29647672,Posted: 2 February,all,Anna Druvez,"A genuinely fun idle game. I'm enjoying the ability to decide what the Guildians will face in their quests. The cards add some strategy. The choices between guilds add even more. I look forward to the next island (and the next and the next) and any future content.I would like a few more quests at each node. As it stands, each node appears to have one each of easy, medium, and hard. However, in category you either wind up with 3 exploration, 3 combat, or 2 of one and a single of the other. Perhaps one more quest per node so that the mixed nodes have a slight bit more versatility?As this is still in Early Access and is free for you to play, I'm not going to say much more. I definitely suggest trying this game."
