It would of been okay if it was free but this is just a insult to any VR game.Edit: The game is still crap and not worth wasting 5 mintues of your life. Do something better and actually send money to charity than waste your time on this crap."

,Recommended,547850,26466599,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,somebody336,"Trump Simulator VR is a vr only game that puts you in the shoes of Trump preparing for a speech. You are given 5 minutes to prepare a multitude of things such as the actual speech itself. You'll be able to do these tasks in any order you wish and are given full reign to interact with everything in the small room. Objects have physics to them so you can throw them around in a satisfying fashion though nearly everything in it has a purpose so making a mess can make it harder if you have any intentions of “winning”.It's all rather cheeky and at Trump's expense which may annoy some. Things he must do before his speech involve shredding his taxes and feeding a bird with chocolate that Vladimir Putin sent him alongside a rather erotic picture of himself. The only voice acting comes in the form of your secretary constantly badgering you to get a move on and from voice clips of Trump himself to make up a speech. Making that speech was perhaps the most amusing part of the game as you have to line up words on your fridge and even a single word counts as a speech funnily enough. I can just imagine Trump going up to the podium, saying “Clinton” and dropping the mic to thunderous applause.If you start running out of time due to being lost in your own delusions, you can simply reset the timer and everything will default to its original position. Once you know what to do and where everything is it becomes an insanely simple task to finish in time. Conquering that challenge will allow you to access a bonus round called “Grab The ♥♥♥♥♥” that tasks you with catching a teleporting cat. Simple as that. Trump Simulator is a bare-bone game you can literally beat under 5 minutes on your first time if you don't gawk and mess around with the environment. While it does cost a single dollar, that may be a tough pill to swallow for some. Overall I think the amount of enjoyment, however gimmicky it may be, is worth the price of entry."

Cons: You can't eat the food and the bonus game is too easy, probably because you are famous and they just let you do it."

I'm sure people who do not like Trump would surely get a kick out of it. The bonus game at the end (catch the ♥♥♥♥♥) caught me completely off gaurd.
,Recommended,547850,28337469,"Posted: 12 December, 2016",all,byteframe,"Donald Trump is a petulent donkey-brained man-baby. His selection for any cabinet post (so far) seems to be a corporate monster or an inexperienced suck-up. He appears to have a fairly extensive history of sexual predation, in case anyone didn't notice. His strong need to be liked will be taken advantage of by his party to turn the healthcare market into a cluster-cuss. He couldn't untangle his network of foreign business ties and rampant conflict of interest, even if he wanted to, and I believe he does. This review itself indicates it is impossible for his critics not to goad and taunt the Preisdent-elect -- he will add me on steam and tell me I am a disaster. He makes for great television, maybe it will be fun watching everything get screwed up.That being said, this game was fun, and it was funny. I was going to downvote the game. Not quite sure why, maybe to make a statement about trump-sploitation. Forget that, I will most probably continue to buy Doland Trump VR games. It's all my fault anyway, I didn't vote. Please dislike my review,if you think your grade school bully should be plucked from the playground and given the United States government. This is one statement on the matter.Trump Simulator VR is a great game folks, Ok? A great game. I know many, many people (fantastic people, truly fantastic people by the way), and they all tell me Trump Simulator VR is the best, the best. Not like those other crooked Trump games! I don't endorse that stuff, believe me. One in particular, was shown just on the steam store _just_ the other day, folks! I played that one, it was a disaster, a big fat disaster. I, and I alone know the secret to selecting good trump games.We're gonna make Steam great eggs again!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=878039663"
