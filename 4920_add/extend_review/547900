76561198073827099,Recommended,547900,27525093,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,Spidermoon,"OverviewThis is the 8th edition of the Front Office Football franchise. It's a franchise that has come a long way and continues to impress more and more people. Much like the other mainstream text-based sports games, such as Football Manager and Out of the Park Baseball, it feels and plays much more intimately than a Madden Franchise mode. With that said, let's get into the review!Pros‣Real Players: The real names of players are included, and they are on their real teams.‣Customizable Players: You can customize their name, number, and even attempt to change their position.‣City Relocation: One of my personal favorite features is that there are a TON of cities that you are able to move your team to, but it isn't easy; you need to get a new stadium approved, which is hard to do in small cities. Other things are involved as well, such as the cities' other entertainment options and their desire for a team/closeness with other teams.‣City Growth: The cities, along with what was mentioned above,grow on their own.For example, the South could experience rapid growth, sparking a huge growth rate for the city of Orlando. In turn, this could lead the owners of the Jacksonville Jaguars to move to Orlando. The options are nearly endless.‣Playoff Chances: After Week 5 of the regular season, the game allows you to simulate the odds that the teams left in contention make the playoffs. This is a new feature from FOF7, and just adds even more value to this game.‣Endlessly Deep: The game is deeper than the Mariana Trench. In all seriousness, it has more realism than anything I've ever seen. You can design your own plays, set up your depth charts, and much, much more. You also have the option to leave all that to the AI and just focus on signing and managing the players. This deepness is a result of the hard work that the developer puts into each and every aspect of the game.‣Great Help Menu: The amount of depth of this game could and should leave you a little lost, but the help menu provided in game is incredible at explaining what everything is and how they all work. Give it a read.Cons‣Team Names: The teams do not have their real NFL names or logos. However, this is an easy fix due to an incredible community and the in-game team name changer.‣Crashes: If you play this game long enough, you will occasionally run into crashes. Not a big problem, just remember to click that save button!Final ThoughtsThis game is incredible. If you find yourself looking at this review, the odds are, you want this game. You will like it. If you are a football fan, there is a 100% chance you will like this game. Unfortunately, my team has less than a 0.1% chance to make the playoffs this year. Oh well, there's always the 2098 season!"

You thought he'd develop into a solid pass rusher -- and that came true. 6 sacks last season was third best on the team. But as training camp approaches, and your roster is starting to gel -- he thinks he's worth a raise. You look over his performance -- pass rush great, but he's only been so-so in coverage. You've got another guy who could play in the role, but Sam is better -- and he's better than anyone who you could find in free agency. But you have some gameplan ideas that might help use him effectively and limit his liabilities. He wants to be making $3 million a year -- and if you give him that money (with guaranteed bonuses) it might squeeze out your cap space to re-sign your game-changing tight end next year. You make the call... it might hurt to pay him this much, but he'll be angry if you don't pony up.Interested yet?THIS is the essence of Front Office Football. This isn't a button-mashing game. This isn't about absurd stats and silly power-ups. And this isn't a game which will test your graphics card. It's going to test your brains, your balls, and your gut instincts. This is a game where you... ""put yourself in the front office.""Your tools are scouting reports, rookie combine data, on-field statistics, and personality traits. Your decisions include salary cap management, roster-building, young player development, depth chart decisions, gameplan architecture, and finding value where others might miss it. Take on as much control as you want, turn over details to your hand-picked staff if you prefer. You can run the whole show, be just the GM, just the coach/gameplanner, or you can call the plays yourself in-game from a vast menu of options.Play a whole career, build your team in your own image, and tune your skills for a great challenge across a robust universe of multi-player leagues, with options to suit nearly anyone's tastes.If anything I'm describing above is what you're looking for in a football game... you owe it to yourself it play this one. FOF 8 takes a long tradition to a new level, and is a must-buy for the under-the-hood types who love the gridiron."

There's no challenge like matching wits with human GM's in FOF.

I would often let my coaches run the game, and just keep drafting, acquiring, and building up talent like a GM.  I looked forward eagerly to each new Madden with the various updates for the franchise mode on any given year.  I posted about my GM obsession about Madden on MaddenMania, and talked about how I would love Madden to really embrace what it was like to be a GM, and to really flesh out franchise mode as much as possible.  Someone said I was just describing a game that already existed and pointed me to FOF.  I saw it was everything I had hoped for.  I come to FOF.  Now, you can do a lot more.  There's massive expansion of playcalling in this iteration.  You can do a lot.  And it let's me live vicariously through the game.  Don't like what's happening in real life?  Change it!  This year, I took my beloved Jags (instead of 2- and suck) to 11-5, won the AFC South, lost to the Raiders in the divisional round, and had a lot of fun doing it.  No sports sim is as detailed, fleshed, or as realistic as this one.It's worth picking up.  And it's another strong, stable-from-release product that you expeect from Jim over at Solecismc Games."

I read that the creator was going to make a sequel so I waited for the release(I do this with sport games in general since they're typically the same with a few graphic upgrades and such. This game has a lot more changes from the original than I thought it would have but overall the gameplay is still much the same. The AI is more advanced , the playcalling is much more advanced , the graphics are updated and you can always mod them to how you like,  the record keeping is also advanced.My biggest issue would be I can't have a seperate window for division standings and the simulation window which I loved to look at.One thing I love about this developer is that he immediately works to fix bugs , update the game and overall just take care of it , alongside that is the very supportive and active community that releases mods and programs to help the user's exprience with the game.overall if you're looking for a american football simulater this is the game to get , probably the only major football simulator out right now now called madden."

Version 8 has revamped a lot of the playcalling aspects, almost all for the better.  The game goes into offensive and defensive philosphy to allow you to really feel like you have control over the team you are building.  If you see a player in the draft with great potential, you still have to decide if he fits the team that you are trying to build.  It isn't just about plugging in good players without a plan in mind.The game also allows you to set pretty much every aspect of your team to AI control.  This lets you focus on what interests you.  If you want to simply build the team as an owner/GM and not worry about the day to day aspects of the team, you can do that.  If you want to build every single play in your playbook and call every single play of every game, you can do that, too.Version 8 has also added fast simming to allow your league to build up a history (all teams on AI control) with one click.  That is a nice little feature to add.I am enjoying this as much as I have enjoyed any version of the game since the first one I played (FOF2).If you like sims and you like football (or even if you only like one of the two), it is a definite buy."

The way I am able to immerse myself into running an NFL franchise is incredible.  All aspects from the player draft, free agency, to setting offense and defense game planning is incredibly detailed.  The fact that a patch has already been released within a week of the initial game says a lot about how the developer cares about making this product great.  Don’t hesitate to purchase this game.  You won’t regret becoming part of the Front Office Football family."
76561198058515870,Recommended,547900,28148096,"Posted: 2 December, 2016",all,dbdonlon,"I've played the FOF games for years and they've always been great in every way except one -- presentation.  If you have to have nice graphics, or really any graphics, then this is not the game for you.  But if what you want is a deep and accurate simulation of NFL football, then this is the only game in town.Among the new features, my favorite by far is the updated log.  It now spells out everything about the play, who was in at what position, and even gives a grade for each player.  It's a magnificent addition that allows you to evaluate how your players are playing throughout the game.  It is almost certaily possible for someone to make a graphical viewer using the information given in the log that would dsiplay at the very least what the formations looked like and highlight who did well and who didn't.  If such a thing were added to Solevision it would finally make that feature useful for me.A feature I'm not quite as keen on, at least not yet, is gameplanning.  I usually want to play as GM anyway, but if I were to want to try my hand at coaching, making a plan is too laborious a process as it stands right now.  It needs some streamlining before it's user friendly enough for anyone who approaches it casually.  Fortunately, the game makes fine gameplans on its own.And this is reminding me of another of my favorite new features.  It's such a small thing, but it makes a big difference.  Coaches now have styles.  It's no longer so easy as hiring the best young coach you can -- he also needs to fit your team.  Or, if he's too good to pass up, you'll need to make changes in your team to accomodate his style.And of course the best part of the game is its ability to generate decades of NFL-realistic stats as you play.  I have never seen a more accurate NFL sim than the FOF series, and I think this one is probably the best one yet.I'm stoked about the new release and look forward to many years of enjoyment.  And oh yeah -- one thing that's easy to overlook about this game is how well supported it is by its developer.  It was only just released last week and we've already had the first patch, which fixed all the issues that I had any trouble with.  The developer also likes to surprise us with updates (for free!) whenever he has something new.  This can be something as simple as a roster update, to even including major new features.  I'm not promising unannounced new features will happen but I can tell you that they have happened before.  Other developers would make you pay for your yearly updates.  Solecismic won't promise them -- or even really let you know they are likely to come.  But when they do you'll just wake upone day and have them.So I recommed this game and its developer wholeheartedly.  If you like sports text sims that are accurate and realistic, you can't do better than this one."

If you like NFL football and text simulation games, this is an easy must buy. Head over to the FOFC forums to get logos/mods for the game. You are the GM and do can do as much or as little as you want, hire coaches/coordinators, scount the draft and look at the combines, put together a gameplan/playbook each week or trust in your head coach to set your depth charts and cocah your team as you watch from the pressbox. Very deep and accurate NFL stats."
,Not Recommended,547900,29049932,Posted: 5 January,all,Angry Bob,"Other reviews have gone over what's good with the game and I concur with those reviews.Here's why I ultimately can't recommend it.  Let's talk rosters. Each player is graded on a scale from 1 to 9, with 1 being a scrub, and 9 being a rare Superstar.  So the game ranks all the players, but their individual attributes are NOT ranked, only their overall skill.  Example: If Todd Gurley has a grade of 7 the game will randomly determine his individual attributes based on that 7.  We know that Gurley is a bruiser with average speed.  When you start your league, however, the game may look at that 7 and determine that Gurley's actually got 9 out of 9 speed and 4 out of 9 tackle breaking ability. It's completely random every time you start a new league.You can manually override this randomisation and assign the attributes you desire (at least in single player mode), but there's no in-game option to do so, you first have to export a player.csv file and then edit a spreadsheet using Excel and then import your newly edited file into the game. To make matters worse, the spread sheet is highly abbreviated forcing you to consult a legend frequently to make edits.Additionally, many of the game's overall grades for players seemed way off.  Example: Aaron Rodgers was a 5 out of 9 while Brady was an 8 out of 9.  Vic Beasley, who just led the league in sacks, was a 2 out of 9.  I tried a fantasy draft and it had Carlos Dunlap as the best overall player in the league while some of the elite players like JJ Watt were average at best.  And this is all due to the randomization.The rookie draft was also odd.  There's not a way to scout players manually.  Instead, your coaching staff's ""Scouting Ability"" attribute determines the accuracy of the grades that the potential draftees get.  There's no other way to ensure you're drafting good players that I could see.The UI is another negative.   It's drab and unintuitive.  Small font and abbreviations for nearly everything make it a chore to navigate.  I also never found an easy solution to organizing the depth chart or making substitutions.  I'm sure the feature exists somewhere, but I was nearing the 2 hour mark of the game I didn't want to go over my time limit so that I could ensure the refund.Hate giving this a thumbs down, as there's nothing else like it out there, but it needs massive changes to it's logic with rosters and UI to be enjoyable."

It's a Gameplan and Roster Management Sim.  The developer has taken realism to a whole new level.  Season stats are realistic.  Player careers are realistic.  It's almost bizarre how much detail the developer (a one-man independent developer) has put into the games details.  To put it into context, he's beaten EA Sports and their ""Madden"" teams of developers in the player development and gameplanning without breaking a sweat.  Sorry Madden fans, no graphics or action here, it's just a different type of football computer game."

Setting up the game plan, plays etc.  I now actually feel like a coach in a football simulation world.  This is truly the best version of the bunch..Awesome job Jim!!   Here are just two things that I hope get put in.  Standings, would like to see home and away wins/losses.

It's the Superbowl, and you're down 35-28 with two minutes left. Your franchise QB (dare I say future Hall of Famer?) leads a decisive two minute drill to tie the game at 35-35, and for the first time ever the Superbowl goes into overtime. You receive the kick and once again drive down the field, but you are stopped near the opponent's 40 yard line. It's fourth down and 1 yard to go, and it's too far to kick a reliable field goal. You could punt the ball away, but your defense has been exposed today, and you doubt that they can hold. You could go for the first down, but if you fail you'll give your opponent's high-flying offense the ball back with a chance to win the game in excellent field position. Weighing your options, you finally decide to try and go for the first down. You line up in a power run formation, with your opponent in a goal line formation, and you run the ball straight up the gut of the defense. Your RB takes the handoff -- and is stuffed by the opponent's defense.You turn the ball over on downs and the opponents march down the field and score the game-ending field goal.Only then do you realize the sheer effort required to create a championship franchise, and only then do you realize you could lose it all in overtime of the biggest game of the year.

I really get Pumped about  player development, and this is why FOF8 is a Superior Game.  If you play long enough you can learn what to look for in a player to understand and know how he will grow, and mature. ""See the future player he will become!""  When I Draft correctly and select that player who will become a future All Pro, serious wood!  If you like stats, numbers, the chance to be a real gm...almost, oh and if you think you're talented jump into a multi player league and see if you can compete with players around the globe, enjoy the trash talking...its a good time."

You can now choose to run multiple realistic offensive formations and choose your own defensive plays. You have more options on defense to change your preferred personnel. It is disappointing that you can no longer set a depth chart for each personnel grouping. Another criticism of the playbook is that you can only randomly choose your plays. The idea is, you have to choose up to 100 plays out of 200, but you do not choose the 100. Instead, you have to change the ""threshold"" value and it chooses the 100 out of the 200. If you do not like a play, you have to change each part of the play. You are not given a bank of plays to choose from. So unles you want to try every variation on your own, then you stuck with using the ""threshold"" feature. Later when choose which plays to run in each game situation, it is much easier to manage because you can then choose from, the bank of 100 plays chosen in the previous stage of the game.Criticism of the MP aspect. The game system may be fine when playing as a single player because you can act as a coach during the game and make decisions yourself. In MP the games are sim, so you are at the mercy of the coaches you had chosen. Why is this problem? Coaches are key as a GM, but yet, there are very little attributes you can choose from a coach. In FOF7, you can choose the percentage of run to pass plays in a given circumstance. In FOF8, that percentage is no longer present. It is based on the plays you have listed for a given situation and most will have a combination of run to pass unless you set it up differently. it would be different if the game added position coaches and more attributes for the coaches it does include, so that you can make a better decisions on how you want your coaches to conduct the games.Another criticism is drafting. You get a grade and given a rough sketch on the players ability. You can ""interview"" players, but you only have 12 you can perform. The interview only marginally make it more define. It would be nice have the players colloege performances as well. More interviews and more information to help you make a better decision or bad one. LOLAnother change I would like to see is the ability to sign players when I am above the salary cap. Sounds weird, but I like to be able to bring ion guys and then make a decision later. I thought teams can be over until a certain point anyway. It is miner (no I took over a team in a poor financial situation..LOL)I would reccomend playing the game in MP. It is infinitly more fun. Without MP, I think I may fine this game too dull. MOP games are not that time consuming with the exception of the draft and early set up of your team.I know what I wrote makes the game seem unenjoyable, but believe me it is enjoyable to play. Very adictive and fun. If you like football and is critical of your teams choices in the front office, then this is the game for you. If you like pla calling and don't mind SP, then this is a game for you. Way better and more realistic than Madden for sure.Pike"

It certainly isn't for everyone and the interface can be a bit of a barrier but underneath the hood is a deeply complex and dynamic simulation with no exploits or easy ways to win.You can build solid teams with whatever offensive and defensive focus you want. If you want to be a coordinator on either side of the ball then there is play design and personell packages to allow for extreme specialization i.e. utilizing screen and YAC based receivers along with deep ball specialists, all this means that it isn't just about getting the best players. However if you just want to GM then the AI does a great job of creating gameplans based on your roster and your opponent. Oh, did I mention the draft. Based upon 6 combine scores and the ratings bars there is still a great level of busts and surprises in the other direction. Height, weight and age also play a big role. And all of this is just the single player experience.The real gem of this series are the MP leagues and support. I would gladly pay a subscription fee for each MP league but you don't even have to. If you are a simulation nerd buy the dang game, if you are a true football fan who is sick of Madden exploits then buy the dang game. Take your lumps with the interface and get addicted to SP, after a while get yourself in a MP league (or 4) and you will find that there are no sims (sports or otherwise) that even come close to the challenges presented by FOF.One quick note, the game is published with a help file that is necessary reading and studying material for anyone serious.

This tomfoolery has no place in PC Gaming.Seehttps://steamcommunity.com/app/547900/discussions/0/135507403157798555/xxxxxxxxSee I'm going to recommend this game with a caveat.  This game is not easy to pick up and learn, and the game does itself few favors in that regard.  The developer approaches the Interface in the same utilitarian way that ToadyOne, of DwarfFortress fame, approaches their UI: The UI is a means to display as much information as is possible, not necessarily as efficiently or as beautifully as possible.  But if you can look past the UI issues, you'll find probably the best Gridiron Management game out there.FOF8 has built upon FOF7's solid Owner/GM experience while fleshing out the playcalling and gameplanning for those of us who want to try their hand at coaching.  Now you have the ability to build an offensive playbook each year, filled with up to 200 different plays.  These plays can be made yourself or you can generate a given amount automatically, and each play has it's given style that can synergize with your Off. Coordinator's preferences.Once plays have been generated in your playbook, you'll need to actually build up a gameplan.  This too can be automated, a feature that you will probably avail yourself of if you're anything like me.  You see, on both sides of the ball you'll need to plug in plays for each possible situation.  1st and 10, 3rd and long, 3rd and One.  Ect.  However the current setup requires you to adjust 1 play at a time.  This adds up to alotof clicks.  This is by far my biggest gripe in an otherwise fantastic new feature.    Additionally, there are existing limitations to the # of unique plays in the playbook.  On defense it is 12, and on offense it is 50-60, depending on your Offensive Coordinator.  This system makes perfect since and is a fantastic way to add depth to your coaching choices.  However, in addition you are limited to around 80 plays in the gameplan in total.This makes absolutely no sense,especially on the defensive side of the ball.  Why the hell wouldn't the defense be able to remember the same 12 plays as often as they need to?Unfortunately because I play as a coach first, and a GM second, these issues have entirely ruined my experience.  Forcing myself to run with either a generated playbook that I have no investment in, or a hamstrung playbook that doesn't have the depth I need just makes me want to walk way from the computer.  As such, I've uninstalled the game until the developer can address these issues in the gameplanning system.Final ThoughtsThis game has a lot of progress to go before it's what most would consider 'polished', however it is already the absolute best Gridiron Management game on the market.  If you you are looking for a GM experience, and are ok leaving coaching to the game's AI, I am confident you will find yourself hooked.  However the new features in the coaching realm have hamstrung those of us who prefer to focus as much as possible on the day-to-day running of the team.  That said, the developer's history of releases also all but assures us that he will continue to support his product and address these flaws."

,Recommended,547900,29345058,Posted: 18 January,all,ChadS,"I've been trying to decide how to best review this game for newcomers.  I've finally decided with the following.FOF8 is my first version of this franchise.  I'm a long time gamer, programmer, sports simulation enthusiast, etc.The Good:FOF8 is a pretty darn good game.  It gives you some flexibility in building a team, and managing it.  There's some opportunity to call plays, as well, which can add a layer of depth to the game for some.  The bulk of the game, though, is dealing with your roster and improving your team.Overall, it's what most people want from a sports sim that does not have a graphical component--it's a number-crunching engine, and produces reasonable statistics, for the most part.  The hardest part is managing your salary cap.  The second hardest is managing your injuries.  I found the injuries to be a little to frequent with the default setting, and dialed them back each year until I got to something I thought was about normal.The Bad:Many of these are tiny issues.  There's very little ""flash"" or ""pop"" to the presentation of the game.  It's very similar to looking at a bunch of spreadsheets.  Some of the ""cool factors"" that are added (Green Sheet, Grey Sheet, Scouting Report, etc.) don't feel like they add as much flavor as they could.  Some features aren't properly documented, and some things that feel like they should be no brainers aren't in therePerhaps my biggest beef with the game comes when I'm calling plays.  First, I don't sense much effect with regards to calling plays.  I can call for a deep route on 3rd and 20, or on 2nd and 1, and it feels like defenses cover it the same.Also, it feels as though virtually every 3rd down play is successful.  I had a spell of 8 games where my (undefeated) team only stopped opponents on 8% of their 3rd down attempts.  It didn't matter if it was 3rd and 4, or 3rd and 25, the opponent almost always got 4 yards more than they needed.  Even after drastically improving my defense, this continued (although, the opponents success rate did fall toward, but not into, more normal ranges).  In short, I have the league leading defense in yards per play, yards per run, and yards per pass, but I can't stop a 3rd down, almost ever.I gave up play-calling for that reason.  I strictly manage the team and the rosters now.One other little thing--12 year veteran lineman will try to get you to sign them to 4 year multi-million dollar deals pretty regularly.  I don't know how realistic that is.Finally, if you are in playcalling mode, there's no way to change your personnel packages.  You can't sit your awesome QB in the 4th quarter of a late season game to keep him healthy for the playoffs.  Packages are set from game to game, and I have yet to see a backup get playing time, outside of pre-season.  That makes it pretty hard to nurture your up-and-coming first round QB pick.Otherwise:The game is fun, if not perfect.  There does seem to be tendencies for players to resign with you when they have high loyalty, for example.  Most players want unservicable salaries after a couple of years, and you end up with decisions to make.  Every once in a while you'll find a veteran that's willing to renegotiate to lower your current cap problems, so you can bring in someone new.  Even superstars are hard to trade if they have a big contract.The game doesn't really tell you what you're doing wrong.  It will tell you what positions you need help at, but it's not specific at all.  I had a situation where I had what I thought were good D-linemen, but I was getting killed in the running game.  It would be nice if the assistant coach might say, ""we need some run-stopper linebackers,"" or something to help me figure out, ""oh, I'm getting owned in the gaps.""I hope this was helpful, and I hope you enjoy the game!"

I started playing FoF 7 a few years ago and I've been hooked ever since. If there's something I really have to stress to anyone on the fence about buying this game who has never played Front office Football before it's that this game isn't for everyone. This game is for people who are looking for the most in depth football text sim, this game has a steep learning curve, and requires a solid time investment to be successful. For those who already own FOF7 I don't feel like there was enough added to the game to justify buying FOF8 outside of the fact that most MP leagues have moved on to FOF8Some features of the game-Full Multiplayer leagues. In my opinion this is the #1 reason to buy the game. The SP mode can be fun but in any game like this when you learn enough it becomes a little too easy to beat the AI with consistent success. There are several active MP leagues in FOF8 who are regularly changing ownership and accept players of any skill level. Competing against a full league of other owners is a worthy challenge and makes all stages of the game much more interesting.Offense:-Full control of depth chart by formation-Full control of offensive playbook. You can either generate plays tied to your Offensive Coordinator's philosophy, or you can create all your plays yourself. This allows you to create your own route concepts in the passing game. Playbooks can hold up to 200 plays and you can save playbooks if you want to use them season to season-Full control of your weekly offensive gameplan. The amount of plays you can use depends on your OC again and allows you to set which plays you want to be called in which situation. Game planning can be tough but gives the player control over your offensive style.Defense-A wealth of defensive styles available-Weekly game plans allow you to play your defense to your team's strengths-Gives the player control over how often your defense blitzes, plays man / zone, or bump and run coverage. Also has formations that bring the safety into the box for a stronger run defense.Roster Management / Drafting-A fairly complex system where player ratings aren't everything and much like the NFL there are underrated players who find in game success and high rated players who under perform.-Player ratings that are never perfect. The game uses your coaches' scouting ability to determine the ratings you see, a player's true rating can differ fairly significantly from the ratings you see. The more years a player has been in the league the closer your scouted ratings will be to a players true rating.-A draft system that is truly more of an art than a science. You're not going to find your 6th round Tom Brady but for those who are willing to put the time in you can start to identify solid role players deep into the draft.-A contract negotiation system that is tied to player production as well as skill. Unproven players or players who have under performed recently will sign for a discount. Low-average rated players who have impressive seasons statistically will demand more money.-Player hold outs and satisfaction. Some players who feel underpaid will hold out of the preseason for a better contract. Other players may become unhappy due to lack of starting time or because they have a conflict with another player. Unhappy players may refuse to sign with a team altogether.Cons/Criticisms-The UI. Personally I find it manageable / tolerable but I have seen many people complain about the UI over my time on the FOFC forums and feel it should be mentioned that this is something some people really don't care for.-Lack of control in more subtle ways. There's no such thing as a ""zone run"" scheme, no such thing as bringing a 6th OL in as a TE, and no way to put your TE in the slot unless you play him as a slot WR in a certain formation. Also you cannot choose which player will be blitzing from a defensive formation altough you can influence it to more often be your best pass rusher.-The game seems to favor the short passing game / screen game over throwing the ball 10-15 yards down the field. (opinion)-Running backs can get way more touches in a season than would be realistic if they have high enough endurance."

If you're looking for a hardcore, true-to-life NFL football simulation, you won't find a better game.  There are some other options our there for strategic football simulations, but this is the one I consider the cream of the crop.If you're looking for a simulation of what it really feels like to be an NFL general manager, you have found your game."

Unless you think it's a Problem Solving game packaged as a football sim; then it's exactly what you think it is.The object is not to try and win Super Bowls - proportionately, you'll spend very little time working towards that goal. Most of your time will be spent searching forums to try and understand the nuances of the interface.Your questions will increase the more you search while your faith in the integrity of the numbers will decrease.And ultimately, a text-based game like this lives or dies on the quality of the AI which, the more you dig, is clearly suspect.For example: Finding no solution to the problem of starting Season 1 with a coaching staff I didn't want, I turned to the Draft from Scratch option. Here are the first seven players taken by the AI in that draft:1 Joe Thomas2 Joey Bosa3 DeForest Buckner4 JJ Watt5 Geno Atkins6 Aaron Rodgers7 Marcus MariotaProblem solved."

The game engine is very mysterious, so in MP everyone has their own little theories about what works best. MP play is easy-going and slow-paced, sort of like playing postal chess. The community is very active creating web pages for leagues, utilities to perform a live draft, data bases, or simply to discuss game play. I know I'm shown with about 800 hrs played, but this is just the last version. I actually go way back with this game. It's become part of my life routine to start the day with 10-30 minutes of FOF, then check back the next day and see what happened (actually, my hours might be a bit bloated from leaving the game on the background while I carry on with my day before deciding to do something). Very recommended, but only if you intend to play MP. SP is super boring."

What kind of company uses a 1995 looking website and doesn't use an official in-house forum?I gave up text sims for a while but decided to purchase his latest game to see if he could modernize his game. Wrong. I couldn't tell you by looking at the game whether it was created recently or 20 yrs ago. The UI is awful and is a HUGE barrier to enjoying the game. It looks like a spreadsheet and after a while of fast simmijg it feels like a spreadsheet and missing any type of fun factor.Unfortunately Jim/Solecismic has lost me as a repeat customer and I look forward to football text sim games from other companies - however long it takes for that game to come out.Don't fall for most of the thumbs-up or positive reviews - they are the product of a longtime hack/fanboy trying to drum up interest in a failed product to appease the sensitivities of the game's creator. I am a long time player of this game and I just can't bring myself to play it anymore. Had it for about 3 months and am gonna delete. Goodbye Solecismic, it was fun while it lasted (20 yrs ago)."

It takes the skill and mental challange of coaching out of the game completely. Depth chart is a mess and you cannot change the depthchart in game in case of an injury. Bought this game for the updated rosters, played for three hours and got a refund. AWFUL"

Superb game i give it an actual score 10/10 that means it's good.. you need to have an imagination and get the mod skin the UI so it looks like netzero or juno browser. Don't talk bad about the dev he's stubborn but he's also cool stubborn. Some people are cool stubborn and some are just dumb like myself.

Rude, sarcastic, generally unhelpful old men. There are roughly 5 leagues or so total that have a full 32 members, and it's basically all the same people in each one. I played this version for about 8 months and never once saw a new league form. All the stuff about how bad the defense/AI are is 100% true. The developer wrote a letter 4-5 months ago stating he was no longer going to be updating this version (less than a year after it's release), and posted it on FoF central.. one day later he removed it, and there hasn't been a word from him after that.All the positive reviews you see from the last 5-6 months are a coordinated effort on part of one GM to try to salvage the remaining leagues he runs, even these leagues see 1-2 players a month quitting.You will spend countless hours on hours trying to understand how the game works as just about everything in the game is some hidden bar or rating with zero true explanation on how the game is determining the results, if you ask the community you will receive the most blatantly vague answer, if you press for more information you get labeled an a$$hole and get pretty much crapped on everytime you post something thereafter. The end result of all your attempts to learn the game will result in about 10-15 minutes of actual play time per day.The game is full of bugs that are never fixed. Full of useless information in the help file that pretty much explains nothing in regards to how the game actually works. The few remaining players are the die hards that have been around for several versions of the game and as I mentioned above, are all basically old men who ran this players base off and into the ground."

Want to see your Depth Chart, yeah that's called Offensive/Defensive Staff.  Along with that confusion is the help system, which doesn't explain anything other than definitions of words.  I wanted to know how to sign players in Free Agency since no players show up in my free agency window, so I looked up Free Agency in the help, all it told me was how to open the free agent window and that free agency is where I could sign players.You can edit the rosters in a very time consuming manner of exporting the player file, opening it up in Excel, editing players, then starting a new game using the edited player file.  And you can spend many hours trying to figure out the frustrating layout of the UI.  I can not recommend this game, because of these flaws it makes it a lot of work and not much fun."

It got released and I bought it. 15 minutes in I realised what a mistake I made. Its horrible. But i carried on hoping that I would find what these positive reviews were telling me was so good about it. 4 hours of gameplay in and Ive given up. Its the worst game I have ever come across and I used to own a Vic-20.  I'll never play it again and never again will I buy a game off Steam that doesnt have a demo.   Front Office Football 8 is the biggest waste of 3 hours wages before tax that I have ever spent. I only wish I bought 4 pints of cider instead of buying this game.

It comes across as an unfinished or rushed project.  The offensive side of the game is very strong, the game has progressed in a number of ways.  However defensively the game is very lacking.  The game has a massive amount of potential, but at this point it simply isn't a well rounded simulation.EDITED - Recent patches have now improved the game vastly.  It is a worthy successor to FOF 7 now, an improved version.  Highly recommended."

I would've made a better choice!""?Ever imagined yourself making gameplans, yelling at players in a locker room but in the real life you never made it to a coaching position in the NFL?Ever wanted to manage a professional football franchise?Then this game is for you. It goes into depth with stats, factors influencing revenue of your stadium, scouting, making gameplans, plays and so on and so on.If you're an expert, you should have no problems getting into the game, if you're more the average fan, who knows the basic concepts of American Football but not more, you should read some articles on Wikipedia, but that should suffice.I strongly recommend playing this game in multiplayer, other human GM's are priceless to have, they can help noobs and, well they act like humans. No AI Manager can substitute this.But if you don't want to play in MP, this game has a SP mode, even with the real NFL players if you like.Ever wanted TB12 and Beastmode in one team? Go ahead, do it!Although this game could explain a lot more, so you don't have to look at Wikipedia in the first place, this is only a minor flaw, regarding the fact, that there aren't that many American Football management games."
