,Recommended,547910,26244680,"Posted: 27 October, 2016",all,AestheticGamer,"I actually liked this a decent amount. It's about two hours long and features you walking through a 13-room house in something that's obviously been a bit inspired by P.T., but in my opinion it actually works as the words 'inspired by' are key here. It's not a rip-off and forms its own identity as it goes along. The game is mostly based around atmosphere, exploring your house for notes and slowly changing differences, while avoiding an occasional entity, and checking your phone every once in a while to answer survey questions and check your mail. The phone also has a hint system where if you can't figure out the current thing to do within 5 minutes, it'll give you a hint.I don't want to say too much more than that, but I think it succeeds at what it sets out to do. It also avoids a lot of indie horror pitfalls; It's not jump scare focused (the few scares in it are pretty well done though), the flashlight is decent (and no batteries, plus most rooms have a light switch), and I didn't run into any form of bugs, performance issues... It was actually pretty polished and pretty good looking. My main issue comes that though the story is enjoyable, it's not really that surprising or deep (and the notes have a few typos I noticed, nothing too distracting but they were there), and I honestly felt the survey element was underutilized; About a third of the way through the game it's dropped entirely, and that's a damn shame since it was pretty effective and interesting up until that point. Still, I enjoyed it and would recommend if you're up for exploring a fairly creepy house with some light exploration and where something lurks inside with you..."

,Not Recommended,547910,32828015,Posted: 26 June,all,Ace T'Ken,"Incredibly generic. You walk around a small house until it decides to lock you in a room and dump exposition a few times. There is no danger, the ""evil"" barely makes sense, and there is little direction. The story is poor, and the game itself bugged out multiple times on me (Including the entire cellphone). The environment is very non-interactive and bland. I have no clue how this has such high ratings."

A unique and spooky game that doesn't rely on simple jump scares, overt gore, or other idiocy to get you creeped out!   When I first began playing this game, I thought, ""Oh no, here we go again.."" as I couldn't move very fast and thought it was yet another cheap quick horror job with massive glitches in it. Oh, how I misunderstood!But thanks to a few people in the discussion forum who said, ""Go on, give it a go. It is really good!""I went ahead and gave it a try. This game uses the scary feeling of being home and waking up in the middle of the night in an empty house. You find a flashlight and then, the exploring begins...and something is not quite right in your house. Not right at all.Game play wise, it forces you to move very slowly, which I thought was a glitch at first but now I am thinking it is intentional. This slow movement ramps the tension up to such a high level, I actually had to stop playing once. The graphics are nice and clean. More so, the storyline is both captivating and original! So is the game play! Just when I had lost hope in there ever being another original truly creepy game, this beauty came along..and at such a good price! Looking forward to more from this developer. Serious talent here. True horror fans will love it.9.5/10 for gameplay   10/10 for storyline   10/10 for graphics and overall an A+ game :)"
,Recommended,547910,26266736,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,CjuGames,"This P.T. inspired first-person horror game will take you around 2 hours to complete.As far as horror games go it's quite slow-paced. You'll mostly be exploring your home looking for slight differences in the environment, wandering around looking for notes which provide you with the story. Whilst doing this, you'll see things move, hear noises and also recieve some strange questions on your phones survey app. Truth be told, I thought the phone related stuff was underutilized a little bit. It was probably my favorite part of the game.The scares are well thought out and some are very effective, without resorting to just trying to startle the player. The game also looks and sounds pretty fantastic all things considered, so you can really get quite immersed.I don't really have any complaints, although I think I would have preferred a more diverse list of things to occur in the house whilst looking for the notes. Around mid way through the game there seemed to be a 'scare-drought' for lack of a better term.Overall I think this is worth the price, but be warned - you'll have a lot of reading to do to fully appreciate this.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4t_XM4sNxI"
,Recommended,547910,31234799,Posted: 19 April,all,Stachmo,"My favorite thing about this game is its certain kind of atmosphere. It is masterfully well done and gives off great feelings of dread, isolation, and fear all at once. That certainly sounds familiar to me. The feelings and the mood are the same in F.E.A.R., Obscuritas, Pineview Drive, and INFRA, hence they all share plenty of similarities. And keep in mind that all horror games have different kinds of atmosphere. The more you play horror games, the more you would be able to recognize the differences. Anyway, I highly recommend the experience of exploring and allowing its mood to take over.Also, the use of scares and the creativity of documents (notes) are excellent. No stupid cheap jumpscares. Butthey are  kind of like you saw in P.T. but quite different. Basically, the Survey is one of the best ""low budget"" Unity games ever made and released on Steam. Definitely worth the five bucks.8.0 out of 10"
,Recommended,547910,30216432,Posted: 27 February,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"The Survey throws you into the life of teenager Marcus Walker. You wake up in your empty home, and while exploring the house you quickly come across a series of notes and your cellphone, which prompts you to take part in a survey. What happens thereafter takes you on a series of strange events, and you will soon come to the realization that you're not actually alone, and nothing is what it seems. I will not say more on the story, as any further information will spoil this captivating and haunting experience.The entirety of the game takes place in a small home environment, though don't let that fact deter you from this fantastic psychological horror trip. Through interacting with notes and your cellphone, a series of strange events and horrific facts unfold to reveal the devastating tale of Marcus and his family. It's obvious that this title is inspired by Silent Hills PT, though without the changing corridors. The tense atmosphere and chilling soundtrack will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, white-knuckling your mouse the entire way through this two hour adventure. The Survey doesn't rely on gore or jump scares to suck players in, but rather it does so through its enthralling story and immersive ambiance.This indie title was created with Unity Personal Edition, but do not let that fact cause you to rule out giving it a chance. The optimization is fantastic, as the game runs at a solid 60 FPS at all times. The build of the house is unique, and although I have seen some of the assets in various other Unity games, this is by no means an asset flip. Graphically, The Survey looks excellent, and the controls are sturdy. There are only a few issues with this game, the biggest one being its short duration of one and a half to two hours; followed by a crashing issue that occasionally occurs when you open up the cellphone, which alludes to the third problem of there being very few checkpoints.Despite its minor flaws, The Survey is one of the most creative low-budget indie horror games that you'll ever have the pleasure of playing; it definitely made me scream out loud a few times. It does a lot with very little, and proves that having a strong story, fantastic writing, and intense atmosphere can make even the smallest of areas completely terrifying. However, the price of $5.49 CAD is high given the short playtime of the game, so it's suggested to grab this game when it goes on sale.Rating:4.5/5.0- Excellent, highly worth playing.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

Very very creepy, eerie and tragic story. I was actually kind of sad when it was over!

I'll be honest I had a rough time getting this game to work on my computer and I am unsure exactly why. I meet all requirements for even the max recommendations to play the game and for some odd reason it just would not run properly on my computer. Though in the end it is likely due to me having a toaster XDAll that being said though, I originally got a refund..But I am a really big horror fan..and this game just kept begging me to give it a second try..and I was SOOOOO glad I Did. Although the second try didnt fix my own personal computer issues with the game, I share my library with my BF and it worked 100% fine on his computer with no bugs and no issues at all.This game was an amazing game for the price tag on it. The atmosphere leaves you feeling freaked out even when you have the damn lights on, the whole home is just creepy in its own way. There are some jump scares but what got me the most wasn't even the jump scares it was just the subtle freaky unsettling things that occur throughout the game.The games eerie environment combined with the sound effects really created this atmosphere that just begs you to turn of your flashlight and hope to god she cant see you like you cant see her, and it makes you second guess yourself out of fear of the possibility that she is right there waiting for you. The attention to detail in this game is extensive and you can tell the developer really took the time to put as many little details as he could to really create this place where no matter what room you are in, you are somewhere familiar and yet....surprisingly never at all comfortable being there.I do feel the phone itself could have been used a tad more, or even alot more..cuz all it did was add a creepy factor to the game that I hadn't seen in a game..the  developer could definetely take the phone thing further and make it even creepier than it already is. I also think there are some moments that are taken away from the player because they occur as soon as you pick up a note...which detracts you from the event. So it seems a better idea to me to have the event start after the note is read rather than as it is picked up - so the player gets the best of both worlds that way.All in all, I have very few complaints despite my initial terrible experience. For that reason and that reason alone I give this game a 9/10... If the developer figures out what is up with the bugs that cause the problems I and many others have come acrossed I would consider this game a 10/10 especially for the price. Either way, I do recommend giving this game a try regardles of bugs or not. The story is tragic and horrifying at the same time, the game play (when no bugs were present) was pretty good witha few hic-ups here or there. And the graphics are good enough to make you feel like your really immersed in this haunted home.Good job on creating this terrifying experience, I wasn't let down once I gave it a chance :)EDIT: After word from the developer it is a pretty fair chance the game just uses alot of lighting effects to get the look and feel that it does and can put strain on some computer set ups. It's highly probably this was the reason my computer had it's issues. The developer was kind enough to reply to me so I figured I would edit in that based on that knowledge I would make the game a 10/10 because people who don't play on toaster's would more than likely enjoy this game to its full extent. And a word to the developer, thank you for your reply and keep up the great work, you are very good at what you do and I can't wait to see other horror projects or an any updates to this one as I do feel it was very well done. :)"

,Recommended,547910,33549065,Posted: 14 July,all,obCESsed,"I highly enjoyed this gem of a game. The atmospheric build up is quite intense and the story line was engaging as long as you allowed yourself the time to immerse yourself in it by reading. You have to be into reading as it highly relies on you reading documents you find to build the story up. Without it there would be no understanding of it. It's worth the read. Keep in mind as well, puzzles are minimal. It is a walking simulator so if you are expecting fps or a horror hide and seek this is not the case. However, the paranoia will slowly creep on you as much as you tell yourself it won't which is a testament to the developers and their build ups. I often had my back to the wall reading documents I was paranoid to leave myself exposed in the game, I was a wall hugger extraordinaire LOL It does tend to feel repetitive over time regarding the scares however it's still worth playing through and for 4.99 ($2.99 on sale for me) you just can not beat it. AND those stinkin angel statues!!! I'd crap my spleen out often when they'd show themselves. XD"

I must say I was quite impressed with the atmosphere and story in the game, and overall had a pretty enjoyable time playing it. Though there were some problems encountered, the game crashed roughly 7 times, with bad savepoints meaning I had to rush through the parts I'd already completed just to catch up to myself. I won't lie, this killed some of the atmosphere and by the end I wasn't nearly as scared as I was at the beginning from having seen so many of the things the game had up it's sleeve. One time my computer even completely crashed and I had to restart... anyway, it was a good experience and a steal at only 3 pounds."
,Recommended,547910,26410177,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,DeadGavin,"I want to start out by saying that deciding whether or not to recomend this game did take a little bit of thinking. I think it would be best to break down why based off of categories.*Warning, there might be spoilers if you are hyper sensitive to not knowing anything*Graphics: The game looks really good for an indie game of this scale. I do have to say I was suprised by this, but the only issue is that they didn't spend so much time on making Lilith's movements look good. I found it more humorous when she ran at me than scary because she did a lot of flailing and moving disproportionally to her steps.Story: The story was pretty interesting, but it wasn't really to important to follow. It provided some nice backstory to what happened to Lillith and her family. My only issue here was the lack of the survey playing an actual role in the story... The game was named after this survey but I felt like it was really irrelevent to everything.Scares: When talking about how scary the game was overall there are really two types of scares that people go for as everyone knows (Jump scares and actual tension). This game had about 3-4 jump scares *Lillith running at you from the other side of the room/hall* and tension did rise a lot, but the tension didn't usually lead to the jump scares which is kind of bad in a way. At the begining I felt the tension a lot, but by the end of the game I wasn't finding a lot of tension because in the past I realized that it usually didn't end with a scare unless I saw Lilith at the end of the hallway moving towards me. I felt like the scares in the game could have been improved.Bugs: This is where I had a lot of issues and what really almost caused me to not recomend this game. I crashed about three times while playing. The first time it was right after a, what I would assume, is a checkpoint. The second time I was almost done with the game and I crashed. It brought me back about 20 minutes of game time. The third time was actually 5 minutes after loading in the next day when I wanted to finish the game.There was a spot where if I walked into it I would actually teleport through the wall.Another bug I saw which didn't help the scare factor was during my first encounter with Lillith. When she was in the room next to me crying she did a moonwalk out of the room while half glitched into the wall and me and my friend bursted out into laughter.Overall, if you can look past a few minor bugs and a few annoying crashes the game is worth checking out, so I am going to recomend it to fans of horror games."

This is obviously some kind of bug, but it doesn't happen to everyone.I also had the game crash on me, losing my progress.The next thing to do is often difficult to discern. There are hints available in the cellphone menu, but that's a weak way to get your players to progress.In conclusion:I think if everything in this game had functioned properly, I would have been able to give it a strong recommendation. My girlfriend and I enjoyed much of it despite the bugs, but we ended up having to quit and watch the last 30 minutes of the game on YouTube. That's not acceptable for a game I paid money for."

It's generally quite spooky and has freaky jump scares. It's more of a casual experience that you'll probably finish in one sitting. Once you get familiar with how the game works, it's unlikely you'll reach a part where you're stuck and if you do, you'll even get hints on your phone after a while so you won't have to alt-tab out to Youtube to watch a walkthrough.Speaking of casual, one thing I particulary liked is that it's not one of those games that gives you a flashlight with a ridiculously short battery life making you fumble around in the dark to conserve your batteries in addition to having the never ending chore of finding new ones. There is no ***ing around with batteries at all here. You get a flashlight and it's always good. Sweet!Also, I didn't come across any crashes or issues like slow walking that others have mentioned, so either I got lucky or those were fixed."

The beginning of the game was scary to the point that I found myself hiding in closets rather than face what may be chasing me.  And I am an avid horror fan.  But by the end, I felt that the whole horror aspect had been lost.  Between the fact that the survey had some kind of ""error"" (was this intentional or a glitch?), and the extremely slow pace of the main character, I was forcing myself to finish by the end.  I love plot-heavy horror, and this certainly delivered in that respect.  However, the plot was disconnected entirely from the so-called premise (and title) of the game.  It felt as if the creators had an idea initially, began creating the game around said idea, and then discovered in the creative process that they wanted to take the game an entirely different direction.  What we are left with is a game that is so close to greatness, so close to being the kind of game we need more of, but falls short likely due to lack of planning.  Overall, there is a lot of interesting things happening in the game, but interesting doesn't quite equal entertaining in this case.  If you are on the fence about buying the game, do it-- but wait for a sale.  However, be aware that it feels more like the first attempts of something greater to come.

It's like Allison Road and P.T. by atmosphere and design, although I'd say it feels more ""game-like"" than the actual P.T. did.  Rather than walk through a looping configuration of the same hallway over and over again, The Survey instead has you wander around a simple suburban home.Like the P.T. the game does have a somewhat linear series of events, though it provides you with a cell phone for hints and questions as well as spreads clues to be gathered.  Just like in the P.T. there are ominous radio messages to be heard, and like the P.T. there's something going on in the house.The atmosphere and tension of the game is thick enough to cut with a knife, and as you continue to unravel various clues you will need to keep your wits about you as you learn the story of Lilith and Marcus.

The character moves horrendously slowly, there are spelling errors/typos, I can barely read the documents, the save system is non-existent or poor at best and I can't set the resolution (unless I'm blind).The concept is really cool, the story is drip-fed to you and the horror is spaced out enough to build tension and keep you immersed in the environment.  The issue is that there are no real consequences that come from the main evil in the game.  Its actually part of the story, so, after about two times of the monster chasing me, I wasn't scared anymore, and once the fear died down there wasn't really much left.  If you buy it cheap it might be worth it for a quick thrill but otherwise its not really as good as it could have been."

,Recommended,547910,29418895,Posted: 22 January,all,Seaniemaurice,"Full video review here -https://youtu.be/VHMYue2WR4oThere are too many unity games on steam trying to do the whole PT thing, and whilst The Survey is one of them. It tells it's own unique story and sets it apart from the PT clones. The game is mostly a hidden object, walking simulator triggered via journal entries and mild puzzles. The Survey, struggles at times with making things scary, and making things predictable. Funnily enough, the predictable parts you could tell were intended to be the scariest and the scariest parts were purely accomplished by the atmopshere and sound design. I commend the developer for spending a bit more time on this project than a lot of others, and whilst $5 might be a bit steep, you are getting a fairly decent story in comparison to something else you might be considering on Steam. If you're still on the fence, watch my video, if you're still on the fence after that. Buy the game when on sale."

,Recommended,547910,26343141,"Posted: 31 October, 2016",all,Samination,"I don’t understand why it’s called The Survey. You do answer some questions on your phone for a short period of time, but it didn’t seem integral to the game. It should be called something else.Anyway, the game is very P.T. (that Silent Hills demo) inspired and takes place in a 2 story house. While this sounds small, it actually works very well. The game has great atmosphere and uses psychological horror with only a few jump scares (that you see coming a mile away). For the low price, it’s worth experiencing this 2 hour game as the story is unique with a great ending.My only dislike is that you have to use a cumbersome menu to read in-game notes. They should instead pop up on screen when found. There are many notes to be found and if you don’t read them you won’t know what’s going on, but I guess you could ignore them if you wish. None of them contain anything vital to progressing in the game.ONE OTHER ISSUE: For some reason, when I try to start the game the first time everything freezes. I eventually am able to close the game and steam and then launch the game successfully the second time. I have no idea why this happens, but I've noticed others complaining about the game not working. It just takes two tries to get started. Go figure."

I tried to avoid using it after a while but I'd find myself absent mindedly going to check it then the game shuts off.-Character walks soooooo slooooooow-No save points? I mean I wouldnt mind the crashes so much if I could at least sve my progress and not have to play through the same stuff over and overHowever! I love how much story is in this game, It's sad and a bit disturbing but not unrealistic (the family situation that is) I also discovered that even though the game is pretty much the same for everyone, there are things that change bsed on decision, simple stuff like if you turn on the light in the dining room before picking up a note. Some people get different pictures on their phones. I only had 2 the whole time, but saw some other people had several and things were happening to them that didn't happen to me and vice versa. I would love to finish this game I have so many hours on it from the crashes. But I keep trying because I love it.
