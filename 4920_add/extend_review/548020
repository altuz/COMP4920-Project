I'm giving this a negative review because it SHOULD NOT have left early access yet.  Relatively simple polishing that should have been required to release the game have not been implemented - two examples: 1) remapping keybindings 2) better ship building tools (ie rotate before placement).Its a shame -its a good game, but IMO the rush to 1.0 cannot be excused.  I'll happily change this review if they fix some of these basic problems."

,Not Recommended,548020,26510553,"Posted: 9 November, 2016",all,Vindsvept,"When I started up the game, I didn't know what to do. Even if the developer aimed for a 'hardcore' game he failed to deliver a proper tutorial. I am fine by finding some things out for myself, but not the things that can give me an edge in survival, subsystems and so on. The game looks fine, but feels really empty.The autosaving is a true pain in the♥♥♥♥♥at it's best because you don't know what to expect in the next sector or planet, wich is dreadfully annoying. I have had moments that after my first warp, I got hammered by pirates. This game needs ALOT of proper balancing, a more fleshed out tutorial about how to create a fleet, upgrade a fleet and so on.I really advice people not to buy this game because it feels rushed, but it has potential. I'd wait with buying until the developer has spoken because he's not very active.EDIT: Developer is not active at all, gotten no responses to my questions or that he noted down gamebreaking bugs.Following bugs are in the game:-After loading a save, the loading screen freezes but the game continues in the background. Cannot find a fix.- Ships flying into your ship and getting stuck, no way to get out.- Autosave being a♥♥♥♥♥♥ saving at the utmost ♥♥♥♥♥iest moments.Following annoyances about the game:- Still no acknowledgement of the developer.- No day 1 updates.- Warping into a sector, being hammered by way more powerful enemies. (while I tried the game on easy)- Weapons take too long to reload, wich is annoying. I want a fast paced battle, not a rocket volley every 25 seconds while drifting around like a dumbass.- Still the lack of a proper tutorial.- The targeting of submodules does not work properly, it still focuses the Hull and Warp Core.- The building mode is very, very annoying and does not work how it should work.All in all, this is just another cow to milk, dumped into the Steam Store for the developer to milk cash and run off with it."

I'd really like to recommend this game but... the ship editor...I can't even begin to tell you how finnicky it is, how unintuitive and plain badly it is designed. Until the ship editor had a MAJOR overhaul, I sadly can not recommend this game."
,Recommended,548020,26540097,"Posted: 11 November, 2016",all,Dr. Notson,Lacking fleshed out tutorials makes it a tad difficult to play but once you work past it the game is quite fun. Been looking for a ship building/ combat game like this for a long time now. I've seen people say they've had problems with the builder camera but i feel its rather easy to use imo. That being said there is definite room for improvement gameplay wise as even o  low difficulties strong fleets will spawn in and they almost always get a shot off before you have a chance to activate your guns due to having to find their ships. I also feel that the reload times on all weapons should be lowered to make for a more fast paced and engaging battle though i think given how long it takes they were going for more strategic battles. All in all i would recommend though if you arent sure about getting it I'd wait a month or two and keep up with updates to see where it's all going.

76561198000186420,Recommended,548020,26739372,"Posted: 21 November, 2016",all,Danger Face,"TL DR: This game is worth $10. I love the shipbuilder.The interface of this game is clumsy, and if it were $15, I’d say you might want to wait for it to go on sale. But it’s not $15, so woooooo!I’ve only put a few hours into this game, but I can already tell you the shipbuilder, while different than most I’ve seen, is fantastic. Again, clumsy, but fantastic. It’s hard to understand at first what’s going on with the controls. It was at least an hour before it really clicked for me, due to poor documented/represented icons. Jumping into it felt like the first time I played around in photoshop.But, much like photoshop, once you get the hang of the tools at your disposal, it becomes the best spaceship designing tool I have ever seen in a game like this. And if this is your type of game,  you’ll understand exactly what I mean when you get the hang of it.Basically it is an easy to use set of tools for reshaping, resizing, and moving the parts of your ship. Super simple once you understand what does what.I’ll update this after I have more time under my belt, but already I would love to see this same developer make a sequel to the game. I’m also"
76561198019721864,Recommended,548020,28994109,Posted: 3 January,all,Hollow_Knight,"Once you get through the barebones tutorials this is a beautifully simple, yet potentially very deep space combat game.  As long as a ship has engines and any combination of the dozen or so weapons it's classed as functional.  But figuring out the optimal combinations and placement of said weapons is crucial to success and hugely satisfying.Once you've got your ship, you and your fleet bounce from sector to sector shredding pirates, butting in on warring factions, adding new ships to your fleet and unlocking more modules and upgrades.  The game can be a real challenge, especially on Hard difficulty, but it rarely feels unfair, the enemies have to use the same modules as you after all.Add a soundtrack that switches between serene (while you enjoy those gorgeous, brightly coloured space vistas) and intense (while you annihilate enemy fleets) and a world filled with all your custom made ships and you have a smart, beautiful little game.  Definitely worth the price."

There isn't a lot of depth, but it's some good fun if you like the idea.I should mention ship builder is notably harder to use than just snapping toy blocks together though, so it could probably be frustrating for some players to use."

76561198047005404,Recommended,548020,26704933,"Posted: 19 November, 2016",all,Wolfos31,"TL;DR: Warfleet is fun in an arcade game sort of way, but it has some annoying flaws. It may grow into a cool RPG someday.I got this game because the concept reminded me of EV Nova, an old top down space based RPG where you start with a tiny shuttle and dozens of possible paths. You could upgrade your ship until you got giant battle ships and carriers, you could earn millions running trade routes, or you could move up the ranks of one of several civilizations. It was an amazing game.Warfleet is not that game yet, but I think it could grow into something like it. The battle mechanics in this game are pretty solid, you essentially have cannons/railguns, lasers, and missles. Hull health and subsystems health are tracked differently, and their are ways to disable an enemy ship. You also have special abilites that you can earn like shields or flares you can launch to confuse enemy missles.But it falls flat when it comes to your fleet. All they do is mindlessly attack, and they don't have commands you can use to manipulate them. It's common for your own fleet to destroy a ship you're trying to capture. Still, I have fun in battles, and there is a bit of tactics involved with using your weapons and abilities.Ship building needs some improvements, but it is workable as is, and with patience can turn out some pretty kickass looking creations.The story is also way too thin in my opinion, I'd prefer if there were say 20-50 set systems that generated the same each new game. The author of this game could set up homeworlds for each of the factions, maybe have some neutral worlds in between the faction's territory, and then write a story through missions and let you pick which faction to associate with. Then craft a bunch of random events and continue the randomly generated universe beyond the set systems.If it gets to that or something similar I'd love this game."

(lasers, rail gun, turrets etc.) I've been having fun with this game but honestly it could use a better tutorial on things like how to place a home sector, what the home sector is used for other than storing ships, ships size vs crew vs turrets?? All that needs to be explained in a tutorial which the game doesn't have. You get a sense of how it works through tool tips in the game but there is just no clear explanation. So basically you're left to guess. Overall though, I like it and for the price it is, I'd recommend it to my friends.7/10"
