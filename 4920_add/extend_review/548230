,Recommended,548230,33528685,Posted: 13 July,all,Endyo,"It seems like I've made a habit of collecting really cheap shoot 'em ups that focus on a single unique trait to make them stand out from the endless number of competitors.  SPINGUN (hereafter referenced without all caps) didn't break that trend.   But let me say up front that this game's 'unique trait' is one that takes some getting used to and may be pretty unappealing from the start.Spingun uses two buttons exclusively.  Not just in the gameplay, but in every piece of the game.  Even navigating and selecting items in the menu.  The game instructs you to use the left and right arrow keys of your keyboard for this, but I found out soon that many other keys are representative of “left” and “right” and that it was most comfortable to use “A” and the right arrow key so that my hands were reasonably separated.   Navigating the menus involves left and right to go up and down and pressing them at the same time to select the highlighted option.  Once you start the game, left and right will not only turn your ship left and right respectively, but it also produces forward thrust.  This means pressing a direction will not just turn you that direction, but will have you traveling forward in a circle.  In order to go straight, you have to use what I'll just call the “canoe” method of swapping quickly between left and right.  This also steadily increases your speed, so everything gets a bit touchy as the enemies start stacking up.As those enemies do pop in to existence, you'll need to fire on them.  This is done by pressing both left and right at the same time.  Of course, in doing so, you lose the ability to turn or move forward, so you have to line up your shot while you're moving against a moving target and fire without being able to change your movement along with the action.   So while you have a game that looks a lot like a twin stick shooter, it doesn't play like one.  Along with the strange movement scheme, you'll be collecting pickups in the form of weapons and health.  As soon as you pick up a weapon, the ammo starts draining, so there's no holding on to a good one and firing it sparingly for maximum effect.  Though firing the weapon does drain your ammo faster, so it's still important to do more than spam it as soon as you get it.  Weapon pickups also increase your total amount of ammo for your base gun.  Your health starts out with a handful of blocks that are replenished by health kits.  Health kits, similarly, increase your max health if they're picked up when you're at full health.So that's far too many words to explain a game so simple, but I suppose the real question is, is it fun?  Well, yes and no.  You definitely have to get used to the control scheme and it's one that can make a big difference in how you perceive the game.  At first I found it extremely frustrating, but with some practice it seemed very rewarding to be successful using it.  When I found some success in the game mode Endless Classic (I made it to 19th on the leaderboards!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=975389816)I suddenly started enjoying the game.  However, my experience with the “Boss Fights” game mode just felt like I was playing something that didn't really belong in the game.  Repeatedly losing to things that take up most of the arena with a very limited control scheme and being punished for touching them annoyed me.  Yet I suppose the idea of having game modes that are distinct serves to potentially appeal to different people.  For those reasons, I recommend Spingun because at the very least, you may find one or more game modes that deliver a worthwhile experience and justify the $2 base price.  However, if you're like me and picked it up for under a dollar, it's a little easier to say it's not wasted money.  Good discounts can do a lot for the overall value of a game, and Spingun is not an exception.If you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EndyoGaming#curation"

The game seems to make more sense on a phone as the controls are well placed and ultra responsive (no travel time for buttons). Also the look and feel of having everything so tiny on a phone is also super cool imo. Some way for your acheivements and scores to cross over between the phone and computer versions would be great."

,Recommended,548230,26574178,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,Cuda,"Super challenging game. Quick to jump into. This is a game about badass dodges, and accuracy.One of the most innovative control schemes to date. Expect this in more games to come.Not for someone who wants to be immersed into a story. More for the competitive spirit who won't walk away until something is mastered. Leaderboards are in some ways what this game is about for me. I gotta beat everyone else. And the competition is thick.Love the toned down aesthetics. Keeps me focused on the action. I'm not here to see normal maps and highlights. I'm here to dodge, dip, duck, dive, and dodge. And...shoot..."
,Recommended,548230,26624275,"Posted: 15 November, 2016",all,Canadian Guitar,"SPINGUN is a retro style arcade game where you must survive by avoiding, and destroying various different enemies in a small enclosed ""arena"" environment. This may sound easy, and perhaps even a bit cliche except for one important feature; there are only two buttons to control your ship.At first SPINGUN may look like just another retro arcade shooter in an over saturated genre of cheap indie games, but it offers up three things a lot of the others in said genre don't; a unique control scheme, a surprising amount of customization/content and it's actually fun!The controls might seem simple, but it's really quite hard to master. You can use either A/D or < / > arrow keys to boost and turn the ship simultaneously or press both at the same time to fire your gun. You can't turn without propelling yourself in the direction you push which makes for some interesting flight mechanics in such a simple game; so if you want to go up, you must alternative Left and Right quickly. Whenever you aren't propelling yourself you slowly fall back towards the bottom of the screen. This all takes a bit of getting used to, especially when you have to both kill enemies, and dodge them and their projectiles!There are five different game modes in SPINGUN; Practice, Endless, Zones, Boss and Ballpit. Practice is just that, a practive mode where bullseye style targets randomly spawn and give you a chance to practice flying and try out some of the many different weapons/powerups in the game. Endless is the traditional survival mode coming in both classic and hardcore (hardcore spawns more enemies, and has you playing with just one health bar and no health pick-ups). You have to survive as long as you can against lots of different enemies, some that chase you, others lunge at you, some shoot, etc., all the while health and weapon pick-ups appear to help you out. Zones are challenges that each consist of 5 waves where you have to progress and survive using a specific weapon for each zone. Boss has three different challenes where you face three very difficult and unique bosses. Lastly, ballpit is a fun mode where you spawn in an area full of ""balls"" that break into smaller ones as you shoot them, your task being to destroy them all as quickly as you can.Along with having a good variety of enemies, there's a good selection of weapon power-ups including a flame-thrower, homing weapon, spreader and a few others. One of the other interesting features of the game I like, is being able to boost your total health. If you have max health, for example 4 bars of health, and you get a health kit, it then gives you a 5th one that is empty which you can then fill with another pick up. It allows you to grow your health bar and have longer surival times when you build it up.SPINGUN also has a surprising amount of customization considering what the game is and consists of. There are 50 different ships you can pick from (all of which are only visual changes), many which have to be unlocked by suriving a certain amount of time, or reaching other milestones. You can also change your weapon colour from a slider so you 100% control over what colour weapons you want to use. Lastly, you can select from 15 different boost visuals,  which is the colour of the flame that projects from your ship when you fly. I was quite surprised to see all of this added in to a game like this, customization is always welcomed as far as I'm concerned regardless of game and genre.ProsUnique controlsGood variety of weapons and enemiesSeveral game modesSurprising amount of customizationLot's of fun for a low costConsThe music can be a bit annoyingAll in all SPINGUN is a really fun game for cheap. There's a lot of content for such a simple seeming game and I'm glad I picked it up on the release sale, and would gladly pay full price."
,Recommended,548230,33182834,Posted: 3 July,all,Gamepopper,"This is a game I love because it's a simple, straightforward shooter with loads of combustibility, modes and challenges and a great difficulty. I love how the music slows down during menus, the clear and sharpness of the pixel graphics and how the controls have a little bit of looseness to make moving around enemies a little more comfortable.I also dislike how as a game developer, I wish I had come up with an idea like this, and I cannot find any way of making this game better."
,Recommended,548230,34386686,Posted: 20 August,all,Immanuel Bants,Deserves more attention than it's gotten. It's one of my favourite Steam finds.But if it was more popular then staying on top of the leaderboards would be all the more difficult - and that's why it's so addictive and why I've kept coming back.Good ol' fashioned high score shoot-em-up gameplay with unique physics controls.Would love to see a game expanding on this with a fleshed out campaign/story mode.

,Recommended,548230,34942295,Posted: 13 September,all,Anax of Rhodes,"Another unique shoot-em-up with a cool trick to try!  With just the left and right arrow keys (plus WASD) to control AND shoot with, you must destroy enemies with various pixelated power-ups.  While it won't provide a lot of lasting value, it's worth picking up should you want to try something different and challenging."
76561197991850011,Not Recommended,548230,33701994,Posted: 21 July,all,Dick Justice,"The game is rage inducing not because of its complexity but from a combination of things outside of the players control.  Spawns are randomly deadly, upgrades are sometimes harmful, the repetative music is grating, the ""tips"" at the bottom of the screen mock you, and the controls which are supposed to be the highlight of this game are instead something that continuously find a way to get in your way.  The only pros I can see are that the game can be cheap when on sale, the game is technically a +1 for your game hording count, and the achievements are truly something for those completionist sadists willing to torture themselves."

Once you get use to the control mechanic you'll have a blast.  There are plenty of powerups and health drops to keep you going and to shoot down advancing baddies.  There is a few modes which includes practice, endless, zones and boss rush.  You are limited in a small arena which makes the game more challenging and maneuvering and shooting with your ship takes skills.For the price it is well worth your time if you're into shooters."

76561197972336080,Recommended,548230,27600475,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,Impossimole,"One word FRANTIC!The main challenge is getting to grips with the two button control system. It seems impossible at first but after a while trying to master that little ship becomes rewarding. Challenge zones are a lot of fun and make gameplay a bit longer ( a normal round in endless lasts 1-2mins unless you are insanely good). If you are looking for a fun, frantic, shooter to pass a few mins then its well worth the asking price."
,Recommended,548230,28879393,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,BS004,"A simple shooter game where you only have two buttons to do three actions: Spin rightwards, spin leftwards, and thrust forward. The goal is to survive as long as possible inside a small, sort-of-rounded square room where enemies constantly spawn around, manier and stronger each second.Even though the objective is simple and straightforward, what makes this game difficult is the limited controls. The physics of the ship plus the game's gravity makes it difficult to maneuver the ship in the way you want it to be. Go too fast and you'll bounce around in unexpected directions, move too slow and you'll probably get hit by enemies or projectiles.It's very addicting if you're into hardcore games (not that I'm hardcore. I'm just an averager) with the global ranking encouraging you to keep playing and try harder.There are many game modes as well, which all provide interesting mechanics and separate global rankings. Some game modes are for casual and fun, while some are even harder than the original game mode. Choose what you like!"
