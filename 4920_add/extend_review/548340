,Recommended,548340,28229565,"Posted: 6 December, 2016",all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","Escape rooms are pretty much the one genre that I don't think I'll ever get tired of, especially in VR, but I have to admit that a lot of the releases in the recent tides of escape room VR games have been kind of mediocre (which to be fair is pretty much the same as real-life escape rooms, which in my experience vary dramatically in quality). Abode is not one of those games. Pretty much everything about it is well-designed and high quality, there's lots of things to interact and play with, and it even has a little detective fedora that you can put on your virtual head while you solve its puzzles. The thing that's hard to explain but easy for anyone who's played a VR game to understand is how important that sort of thing is. When you can pick up a lit cigar that has nothing to do with any of the puzzles and pull an unlit cigar from a case and touch the ends together to light the unlit one, it's an insignificant action, but it does a lot to give you a sense of presence in the game, and Abode does that sort of thing really well. It's on the longer end of the spectrum as far as length goes, so you can get at least a little under an hour out of it. It's hard to say much without talking too much about the game, but if you like escape room games you'll love Abode. Escape!VR has been my favorite escape game ever since it came out, and it's still great, but Abode just took that seat."

I wouldn't say that it was too challenging, a lot of the puzzles seemed quite obvious to me though, for others it could be different.It took me roughly 20 minutes to complete it and for that, I don't believe that the $10 price tag is worth it.

So many cool objects and the environment was very polished.  The puzzles were also reasonable.Perhaps the hints could be optional and replaced with funny quotes or something.I thought the price was just right.  Everyone wants it cheaper but when you think about it, a real escape room is about $25-30 per person.I highly recommend this one!   Hope to see more games from you in the future."

Object interaction feels solid, lighting is great, inventory system works well (feels a bit like Budget Cuts).  The atmosphere/environment is incredibly immersive. The puzzles are diverse and interesting, and will make you think but not leave you frustratedly checking walkthroughs.  This game has me believing that room escape games can be a serious, lasting genre in VR, not just a novelty.  I hope to be escaping rooms again from these guys soon!"

When you complete all the puzzles and finally open the door, you enter a hallway with a framed credits message, a window on one side, and an open door on the other side. The door doesn't lead anywhere, the wall just continues through the door hole.I didn't feel like I accomplished anything by solving all the puzzles. There was no ""escape"" factor."

So much fun!The puzzles could be a bit harder. There was only one that really stumped me for a while. It was such a great discovery when I finally figured it out from across the room.The polish is real nice. The physics could use some work. I had a couple things accidentally shoot across the room.

(It doesn't matter if you need it for the story and progress or not).Some nice puzzles to solve in a nicely designed environment. Took me around 1 1/2h to beat the game.Sometimes some items glitch in places where you can't reach them. To fix this simply open the menu and reload your save file. No progress is lost but some item positions are reset.A time limit (normal escape rooms have a time limit of 1h) would be nice to add some pressure.

It truly is a hunt to upturn the entire room to find all the bits your need.While I got frustrated a few times, I persevered and made it through with only short periods of no progression and a lot of little steps forward. I want to see more escape room games made like this.If you like escape room style puzzle solving (this is a lot of find the item that you can use to find the code to unlock the whatever, etc) games I definately recommend this.I do have a comment for the devs - ha ha ha. yeah. no. Even if you just change the end to a key to unlock the door that never opens, that would be an improvement on the ending."

It's fun, different, and an overall great time. The Film Noir style helps you keep immersion with the odd, but yet realistic puzzels. Each puzzel is well crafted and creative. They're not too hard, yet not easy and straight forward. Each one leades to another in a way which you are never stuck and you know where you should focus on next. At the time I was bought it other players and I ran into a small glitch where the mail shoot wasn't magnetic and wouldn't grab the pipes, but after a quick restart of the game it fixed itself and I was able to solve it. Other people are complaining the ending was odd and didn't match the style, but I quite liked it and was a ""satisfying"" end. My only complant is the price, I think 10$ is too much for the 45 minutes (how long it took me) of gameplay, and I can not justify keeping it and never playing it again.

,Recommended,548340,29154907,Posted: 9 January,all,bryndsey,"Abode is a fun and challenging room escape game. It makes decent use of roomscale, and has nice controller models that make it grabbing with fine detail pretty easy. The graphics were simple but well executed. Combined with the jazzy music, it felt like a futuristic detective-noir setting, which totally fits the platform and gameplay.The puzzles are not overly difficult, but still satisfying. I only got caught up on one towards the end. Overall, it still had a nice pacing.I don't want to spoil the ending, but I'll say that while it felt a little out of place, I couldn't help but laugh and enjoy it.Overall, this is a well polished VR game, and one that I really enjoyed. I'm not sure how much I will replay it myself, but I can definitely see myself showing it off to others. I got this game on sale, and would definitely recommend it for the $5 that I paid. I'm not sure now if I would pay $10, but it might be a no-brainer for someone who shows off their Vive a lot or is a huge room escape fan."

It's got a very nice atmosphere, visuals and sound as well as good, well thought out puzzles. For me it was about an hour of playtime. A minor downside is that the puzzles are not grounded in reality; they just exist for being puzzles. However: if you are into escape games, get this one!"

Get some friends and stuff to give it a try.The only issue i had with the puzzle solving is that the magnets for the mailing system didnt work and i still dont understand if i missed something but i was able to get all of the achivements still so thats alright to me.

,Recommended,548340,31011868,Posted: 8 April,all,Captain N,I like this one. The style is nice. The puzzles are good. Not too hard but there are a few tricky tricks. The only problem is that there is zero plot. No story. No beginning and no ending. Makes me want to see a story game from this developer. Maybe you're a detective in a cyberpunk future. It has that feels.
,Recommended,548340,29391236,Posted: 20 January,all,qeoff,"The full game takes about 45 minutes to an hour to complete and doesnt have too much replayability, but I definitely feel that I got my money's worth with Abode. It has a few decent puzzles and the atmosphere of the game is really great; the stylized visuals and the ambient audio worked together to create a fairly cohesive tone to the limited world.The game has its negatives; the controls can be wonky at times and the game physics weren't super tight, but for a few bucks its a fun experience. Would definitely reccomend to people who enjoy puzzle games or classic point and click adventures."

I got about 2 hrs of gameplay, probably would of been less if I did not experience a bug that threw me off.  It was worth the $10.  If I had to appraise this game, I would value it at $7.23, just because there isn't any replayability once it's solved and it is short.  It would be cool if one room led to another, and if the ending had a better reward, the ending didn't exactly invoke that feeling of closure, it felt more like a question...is this it?, Overall I enjoyed it and I was sad there wasn't more."

,Recommended,548340,31163329,Posted: 15 April,all,RadicaLee,"This has been my favorite VR ""escape room"" so far. The puzzles were varied and nothing was overly difficult or unfair. The included clues made it much more enjoyable, as I've been stuck in other games simply because I missed something very basic.At first, the interaction and inventory system wasn't clear to me, but that only lasted a minute, and then it made sense and worked well.One of my favorite features was the record player, as it lets you choose from a couple songs and then set the volume.Took me just over 45 minutres to complete, including the achievements (which were fun and simple). To me, it was worth the $10, and like any game in this genre, you get more value with friends/family that can play as well."

,Recommended,548340,34493868,Posted: 25 August,all,Catovitch,"A short room escape puzzle that works brilliantly in VR. My playtime is a bit inflated as I left the game paused to take a break near the end. While I wish it was longer, what's there is good from start to finish, with no filler and bunch of well thought-out puzzles in a space which is fun to explore. I didn't get all the puzzles immediately, but didn't get stuck on any or need to look up solutions either. If you can't solve one right away, you can walk around and solve other things and come back. Difficulty seems perfect to me. Price seems OK given the small market for VR games and the polished experience. Probably not much replay value, but that's inherent in the genre. Maybe I'll play it again in a year when I've forgotten the solutions."

Its puzzles can lead to the occasional head-scratching, but will award you with another piece to the greater puzzle, which will motivate you to keep playing. Its progression is neither too fast nor too slow (as long as you have a functioning and problem-solvable brain), so you won't have reason to take of the headset to think about how you move on.While it is a short game with an completion time of around an Hour, it is certainly worth the 10$, especially when buying the bundle with Conductor, since its been developed by only two guys who created a solid VR-experience.If you have the money to spend, buy it!"
