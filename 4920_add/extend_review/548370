76561197971012846,Not Recommended,548370,32622365,Posted: 21 June,all,nocluetoo,"Theoretically, this is a good, simple game.  In practice, it's agony and frustration.The graphics are nice, the gameplay simple but fun, etc. I wanted to like it - in fact, I do like the core game - but it's surrounded by so many problems that it's impossible to enjoy.There are little things: no documentation, incredibly repetitive music.  Some cludginess with the interface that makes inventory management awkward. (Want to see which character needs an item more?  Go to one screen to trade the item, then back out of that, select a different screen to compare the stats/equip, back out and repeat 6 more times).  But those are tolerable.  The gameplay itself is simple and may bore some people, but it was exactly what I was in the mood for.But there are the bugs.  Oh the bugs.  There have been several patches and things are improving - but there's much much farther to go.  Some examples:1) numerous game-breaking rendering problems: flickering, only rendering some elements or rendering freezing entirely.(Oh, you can still interact with the interface you just can't see anything).  Every time you enter or exit a dungeon (or start the game), it's a coin toss if it will work or you will have to quite a restart.  (Actually, a coin toss gives you better odds...)2) Corrupt save files let you enjoy the frustration from the beginning! Force quitting the game risks corrupting your save file completely (complete reset of all progress).  Unfortunately, due to issue #1, you're going to be force quitting a lot.3) Impassable floors, passable walls.  Some dungeons can't be completed because tiles will be (incorrectly) marked as impassable.  Doorways/hallways are a favorite!  Better still, using some skills and killing some monsters will sometimes leave a tile marked impassable.  So you can walk into a room only to be trapped there.  Quit the dungeon, lose your progress and risk bugs #1&2 an extra time.    On the flip side, some walls aren't walls.  You can walk through them and wander out into the non-game area!  So can monsters!  Monsters may also walk through what you thought was a wall.  Thought you were safe there?  Nope, you're dead.4) Stuck turns: Some skills attack multiple enemies.  Timing issues with that seem to result in you and enemies moving simultaneously (sometimes).  Then the game then doesn't know whose turn it is.  Nobody is moving.  You're stuck! Again!  Quit the dungeon, lose your progress.  Again!5) Skills and items may or may not do what they say.  Trust nothing.  Skills, bonuses and items may or may not be applied.  You ate 200hp worth of food?  Well, for some reason you only healed 100hp.  You're supposed to heal 10% health for every kill?  That may or may not actually happen.  Dungeon bonuses and skills also seem suspect at times but are harder to verify.I finally quit playing when I realized I got no enjoyment from the game and that my reason for playing was to see if I could outsmart the bugs and still get through a fundamentally broken game.  I really want those hours of my life back."

I tried uninstalling and re-installing, I tried disbanding my party and resetting the game, tried deleting all local content in hopes it would erase whatever bug had occured, but all of it was to no avail. I can no longer progress the game in any way shape or form, which obviously makes this an unplayable game. If anyone knows how to fix this issue, or has encountered this themselves and has heard back from the makers of this game, please let me know. I would love to play this game - BUT only in a working condition.EDIT: 5 (FIVE)  patches later, the bug of being unable to complete a level still remains and this game is still unplayable for me. Everytime I try to complete the first level (on any character) I get to the end and it brings up the menu to select my reward, but it never allows me to click anything or complete the level; the game just stops there and the only way to do anything is to close the game. No matter how many times I try, or reset the party and try again, or uninstall and reinstall, this game remains unplayable. It's like the developers refuse to fix the gamebreaking bugs. Between this and the people who simply can't play because of the loading bug. Time to look up refunding."

I had to literally complete the starting dungeon seven times (once each with every character) to even unlock their starting weapons and abilities. Pair this with an unforgiving difficulty level and I must have done that first, dull dungeon a dozen times now. I'm 1,4 hrs into the game and feel tired of the grind already.Judging by the difficulty curve of the following two dungeons, character progression will demand you do every dungeon with every character, that is a degree of grinding far beyond the worth of the casual-level enjoyment there appears be had here. I'm looking up Steam's return policy for the first time."

You don't control a party of adventurers, just one of them at a time, through a clumsy interface which has them walking through squares which damage them as often as not. Furthermore the game's set up so you'll have to run each of the seven adventurers through each dungeon individually.And you can only target monsters along orthogonal lines, which is irritating. Better explanation would have had me less frustrated, but I'd still have asked for my money back."

And in the beginning everything was great, it crashed 4 times until it finally launched but that was fine. I thought it's my computer causing trouble again and as i started playing, i forgot about this rather small nuisance. Got a little frustrated when my first dude died, but i thought ""wow, this game is quite challenging"" ... so i began to grind exp and gear, am a huge fan of the game over all and the different classes, altho you can give every char every skill and only the stats per level change.Buuut when I started leveling my archer was when all those filthy bugs crawled out of their caves:first my inventory got deleted after EVERY dungeon. I found a nice weapon or piece of armor? Well ♥♥♥♥, its gone now ... and have you ever tried a dungon without pots? Its hell!So the only reasonable thing to do was ragequit, but i tried playing it today again when the best bug occured:When clicking the ""play""-button i saw my characters and all, which was great. Buuuut the tutorial message popped up that i can select my character, sash, skills etc - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, i couldn't click anything. Esc didn't work, lmb and rmb didnt work. Fortunately closing it via task manager worked, money was a waste so far and i am beyond tilted."

,Recommended,548370,32463393,Posted: 15 June,all,Skull,"Interesting concept and tabletop game art style mixed with dungeon crawling and character progression. Requires careful and strategic play, rushing and making a few mistakes in combat can easily cost you your character. Sometimes difficulty can seem too great or too low, depending on your character class/equipment/skills and strategy.Provides good replay value if gearing up your characters with progressively better loot and skills is your thing. Can get a bit repetitive over time."

Bottom line: this game's bugs make it too frustrating to be fun, even after multiple updates supposedly fixing said bugs.  I'm done."
,Recommended,548370,32106036,Posted: 1 June,all,norse,"I find the game fun, but with some flaws that should have been ironed out before being a full release on steam.The good:-Great aesthetics-Good dungeon crawl feel-Interesting looking characters-you aren't locked into any one path with any character, if you really want your mage to go sword and board, they can, it just won't be as effective as having the dwarf do it.-challenging difficulty-Interesting approach to permadeath, if you die in the dungeon, that character is stuck there until another character rescues them, if all your characters get stuck, GG-Legacy points give you some Roguelite progression-monsters have the same limitations as players, they don't have limitless manapools, if you run one out of mana, they can't keep on summoning pets to destroy you.The bad-some game breaking bugs that should have been ironed out prior to release-quite grindy, you have to go through the first mission at least 7 times to get all the skills and starting weapons for your characters, assuming you don't die to the wizard at the end of the level and have to rescue that party member and try again.-BUGS... currently as of last night, there are invisible blocks that can block critical doorways making a dungeon uncompleteable (hasn't happened to me yet, but happened to a friend streaming it and I've seein it happen in youtube videos.  The shared bank slots to store items and swap them between characters apparently deletes any items when the game is shut down and restarted.  Sometimes when you rescue an NPC they just stand in the cell saying 'let's get out of here!' when interacted, but don't actually transport to the end of the level making the level unbeatable.-Enemy AI can be pretty standard and is fairly exploitable, especially with ranged characters.-can be a bit tricky to get to work with OBS for streaming, my friend got it up on twitch last night, but if he went into the options menu, the screen got stuck showing the options menu and wouldn't go back to gameplay automatically.-no tutorial, very few tool tips to tell you how to succeed, so learning is pretty much by trial and error.-Options menu is somewhat barren, no key rebinding, some interesting graphics options.Conclusion:  The game is quite fun, If you can put up with some game breaking bugs, go ahead and buy it and enjoy it as much as you can (I certainly am) but if you don't want to deal with the bugs, toss it on your wishlist and wait for Soaphog to fix the problems, which they seem to be on top of in the discussion area, having pushed some small patches already.The game like any roguelike can be a bit punishing and it does have some tricky situations, like the mage at the end of the starter mission.  Even with the bugs, out of about 25 people that watched the stream 4 of them either already bought it or said they were going to buy it, it IS a good game, just had a really rough launch.For that mage btw, he summons a skeleton.  The skeleton is a distraction, it can only do minimal damage while the mage proceeds to wreck you with his own spells, if you kill the master any summoned minions also instantly die, so focus the mage and ignore the pet to win that fight 90% of the time or more."
,Not Recommended,548370,32118759,Posted: 1 June,all,g05h4wk,"Some hours in, this game fails in one very elementary point: being fun to play. It's all about grinding.I made it till the end of the first map with my Paladin and died there. It was the first level with orcs, tons of them. I had plenty healing and mana regeneration items, nearly depleted them and died right before the map was cleared.  Archer and Rogue were right behind. I have no desire to free the paladin (again). I have no desire to see the other maps.Why?In every level it throws (sometimes ridiculously) harder enemies against you, while decreasing your Stats (WTF?) like Evasion and Crit with every character level you gain. Trying to get a high evasion with character level progress is impossible unless you play a char that uses agility to boost the weapon attack (archer), so you spend like all your points on it. There are sometimes enemies that hit much harder than their counterparts in the same level, like X00% harder! (with any strike, no crit hit) And they look all the same, you won’T figure out until they hit you.You may find or buy better equipment for your char to better out the odds but mostly you get ridiculous stats on it. E.g. tons of high intellect swords, but even rare/blue weapons having worse attack than a usual/white weapon of the same level. As first char I played a paladin with almost all extra stat points you get from crystals spent in luck to get more and better items, still it was mostly not useful or for chars I simply don’t want to play. So I sold many stuff to buy blue randoms and equipment from the store, and also, mostly garbage.You also find new skills in the dungeons. Any char can get any skill, like my paladin could freeze enemies, that was quite helpful. But you can only equip 2 skills in the beginning and leveling takes a while (3 with level 10, 4 from level 15 and so on).Besides that, you gather Crystals that get you extra skill points, which are permanent if you reset your party (You have to if all party members are imprisoned).  Plus, Crystals for leveling your skills, here I always had more than enough of in the time I played (Woohoo no grinding for that, in the early game at least).It’s very lightly tactical, you mostly try to fight one enemy after another. Or you freeze orcish enemies with the paladin to prevent getting hit for a ridiculously high damage (in the first level they appear, rightly after you completed a level with way easier enemies!), hit them, freeze again. Well it’s not very tactical at all.All in all, there is only grinding, nothing that needs your skill or intellect, but your will to grind you strong enough for the next level.The game looks gorgeous though and was fun for the first few hours. To me it is still ok to have spent the 9 bucks for the game, it is fascinating in the beginning. But I expected way more.If you love grinding, this is your game. If not, beware."
76561198036544073,Not Recommended,548370,32800891,Posted: 25 June,all,Decay,"First off, as of this writing/v1.05: The bugs, personally, have not been bad. In 15 hours of gameplay, I've had to abandon just three dungeons due to blocked doors. Good on the devs for working so hard to fix the issues. One does wonder if they beta tested, though.This is gonna meander, because gin.Pros:Having a selectable roster of seven characters is an entertaining spin on the dungeon-crawler.Fun design aesthetic.Cons:Despite how the devs advertise it, Rezrog a rogue-LITE at best. Random dungeons and permadeath do not a roguelike make. Roguelikes are to RPGs as dark fantasy is to fantasy. The roguelike world hates you and wants you not just to die, but suffer and rage as you do. Every unidentified item you pick up should have the potential to violate you in ways that would make a hentai tentacle monster blush. In Rezrog, every item you find is unidentified until you right-click on it; there are no curses or detrimental effects, it's all just vendor trash.The tactical depth of a turn-based roguelike comes from skill-cooldowns, positioning, and resource/inventory management. Rezrog, tactically, is scraping the bottom of the kiddie-pool. It gets the skill-cooldowns right, but the ""resources/inventory"" aspect are limited to HP & Mana and the accompanying potions. Elemental resists are a thing, but each environment has a themed elemental damage. Don't have a fire-resist gem? Just go to the store and pay for refreshes until it generates the gem that you need! Little short on cash/potions/skills gems? Just grind the last boss fight and get all that and a couple legendary items along the way! (I have yet to loot a bag of chips, however.) The point being, with nearly unlimited resources, you will never be anything but adequately prepared for what the game throws at you.Speaking of which, I'm yet to encounter a severly out-of-depth spawn. Granted, I've only played through 30 levels, but they've all been identical. Occasionally a new monster type is introduced to mix things up, but without a true permadeath mechanic the threat is rather reduced.On positioning (and you want to pay attention to this one): The game to lacks a ""pass turn"" option outside of combat. Furthermore, attacks and most skills can *only* target mobs on grid straights; ie, you cannot melee or range anything that is diagonal to you. These two design choices make ranged combat impractical, at best. Why? Seriously? Were the devs unable to figure out the Pythagorean theorem?Last, but not hardly least, the dungeons are all painfully similar. Based on the aesthetic and the whole ""rescue your fallen comrades"" bit, I was expecting some degree of variation. Maybe small, sub-bosses guarding your party members, or hidden traps, or secret or even locked doors. None of that exists. Yet they have a ""rogue"" character, who's only notable due to his cool little face mask and even that's pointless because it's still painfully obvious that he's a filthy orc.As it is, each dungeon simply has one of five (or six, I can't be bothered, because again, Magellan gin is just the bestest thing) completion conditions, most of which boil down to ""kill stuff until we say you can stop."" There's a modifier roulette for each dungeon which tries to mix things up (mobs do 25% more damage, gold/XP increased, etc), but once your toons reach a certain overpoweredness, these stop mattering. AND, some of the options on the roulette (X-ray vision, ASCII mode) never actually pop up. Why mention features that you haven't implemented? Why release a game without implementing everything? Early Access is a thing! Sidenote, I don't buy Early Access games anymore because of this exact BS.Having said all that: I'll probably still beat the game. Because it is rather fun for what it is. But I bought it because it promised a roguelike experience, and that is emphatically not what it is.If you're looking for a grindy dungeon-crawler, then Rezrog will scratch that itch. Just don't expect too much out it.Edit : They've since removed the ""roguelike"" description from Steam and their website. It's the small victories that matter."

I once could not use a healing potion because the game said I didn't have enough mana to use it (died that round).2. The grind and enemy power leaps make it not very fun. I had to run the 1st dungeon over and over again to get my characters to level 3. Went into the 2nd dungeon with fully geared characters a level higher than needed and lots of healing and mana potions; I lost them one after the other. The game is TOO unforgiving about taking damage, which is unavoidable.3.

When that happens, you have no choice but to abandon the dungeon (losing all exp, items, and progress you made) and try again. Considering each dungeon has ~15-30 doors, there is a not insigificant chance of needing to replay a level multiple times just to accomplish something you could have done the first time.This wouldn't be as frusterating, except you lose all of the exp and items you earned during the run.  So if you clear the level but the exit door bugs out, you get zero reward for playing the level at all.  That's pretty frusterating.For this reason, I suggest waiting until this particular problem has been fixed.  It looks like people have been complaining about this problem for awhile, which says the developer does not seem to be very good at fixing bugs."

Paladin or Warrior don't need any sort of Agility, except if you want to train a dodge tank - at level 12+ you'll start moving only in 1 squares in the fight which is more then annoying as you can't evade if necessary :/So i got it with 10% off for 8,99€, every cent worth it for now, many AAA titles for 50-70€ give me less playtime/€ already.For those of you that have problems at the beginning, try the archer and grind the boss levels until you get a decent bow, with the level 11 relic bow (orange) i managed to oneshot most of the monsters on the way to dungeon 20, even the second boss didn't even touch me due to the massive damage output....7/10 atm, if they fix their bugs and make mages less annoying to play i'd even give it an extra point for each~('-')/"
76561198044411944,Recommended,548370,32172398,Posted: 4 June,all,Pepin,"Rezrog is a decent time sink, and priced accordingly. I picked this up at release and I’ve certainly had fun with it so far, bar a few moments and a couple of things that I would change. This will be long, TL;DR will be at the bottom.Story: Nope. Other than a short opening cut scene after the logos, there isn’t anything to add. This isn’t a problem for me, but if you’re looking for something with a deep narrative then this isn’t that.Visually, it’s good. I enjoy the aesthetic of the settings, the little character avatars and the like. It’s a pretty standard thing, but I like that your character’s look changes when you switch gear. . While it can be extremely helpful being able to rotate the camera angle 360 degrees, I personally feel that once you do rotate, the game looks very…weird. I can’t think of a good way to describe it, but it looks ‘wrong’ for want of a better expression. Lastly, on visuals, I would say there isn’t enough variety. There are 100 or so dungeons, split into areas of the map, 10 dungeons per area, and realistically the only visual change between areas is the colour of the walls/floor. The dungeons are procedurally generated, which is something I appreciate.Audio is a bit of a mixed bag, in my opinion. A lot of the time it seems I’m listening to the same 5 notes on repeat, and my brain just filters it out as noise. At first though, I thought it was somewhat soothing, and charming but, like I say, after a while it just becomes either background noise, or a mild irritation when you do notice it. As for the combat/item etc sound effects, I would say they’re passable. They don’t stand out as ‘well done’ or very ‘annoying’, they simply get the job done.Gameplay is the most important part of the game in Rezrog. First off, the ‘Tutorial’ is absolutely not helpful. There is virtually nothing offered, except your starting weapon(s). This is not helped by the mechanics of the game also not being explained. Now, a lot of it is relatively simple to any gamer (click to move/attack) and the UI is something I think we’ve all seen before. However, attacking an enemy from the side/back does more damage. Yet the game does not indicate this in any way. There is no ‘backstab’ icon that appears, there is no text, the cursor doesn’t change shape…nothing. Gems are not explained at all, that I can remember, and even though I am several hours in, I still have no idea where to gain more skills.The general idea with the game is simple. You play through a dungeon, kill enemies, get loot, level up. So it does become somewhat of a grind. This is made more so by the fact that only one character can enter a dungeon at a time, and only they receive XP from doing so. Therefore each character (there are 7 in total) must go through and level up individually. Now, some people may want to just have a single “main” to cut out some of the grind, and that is technically feasible. However, the game encourages you to have multiple characters of similar level with the ‘Captured’ mechanic. When you’re defeated in a dungeon your character is held prisoner there, and you must send in another hero to rescue them. So if you’re playing one “main” and that happens you’re going to have to go through the whole game up to that point again, to level up another character so that you can rescue your main. Like I say, this can be a bit much for some, if you hate ‘grindy’ games. Now, the game is described as a Roguelike, but personally I see it more of a Roguelike-light. I say this because you can save your characters if they’re captured, albeit with some grind, and the game is only ‘over’ if ALL 7 of your heroes are ‘captured’. I am not a particular fan of the ‘quests’ in a dungeon. For me, they simply offer no variety in real terms. Pull all levers, destroy all crystals, rescue someone, collect the key parts, collect sword parts, kill everything. I think that’s all of them, and since you don’t know what you will get until you enter the dungeon, it’s not like you can prepare yourself in advance with healing items etc, so for me it always descends into; Go to every room, loot everything and kill everything then run to exit”. I honestly don’t even look at the quests anymore.Combat was described by some people I watched on YouTube as being ‘very tactical’. I don’t see it myself. Beyond “Which of these 2-3 skills should I use first?” and “Okay, I’ll try and get to the side/rear to do more damage’ there isn’t really much more than that. It is functional, certainly, but I don’t see anything here that makes me think of a real ‘strategic combat’ game. Although they’re not the same, I would suggest that Darkest Dungeon has a deeper combat system. On the subject of combat I found Mages to be terrible early in the game. It’s worth noting that, while I never played paper D&D, I am somewhat of a veteran when it comes to D&D style games. I’m aware that Mages start of terrible and get super strong late game etc, but for me they just don’t seem to do enough with their spells. The next bit is about Mages, but also the Archer class. Kiting an enemy is possible, and advisable, for ranged characters, and this works well, even though you cannot attack diagonally (same for all characters). However the issue I have is that the *vast* majority of rooms that I have seen have been too small for viable kiting, or contain multiple enemies, which would draw more aggro, so it never feels like something that seems worth while.The loot system is nice, although anyone who hates RNG will not appreciate it. On a side note, I wasn’t a huge fan of constantly getting swords and the like with no Strength stat, but almost always “Intelligence”. Regardless it works well and you’re always on the lookout for that shiny new piece of armour, and it is satisfying when you get it. It helps that getting new gear happens just often enough to be meaningful, but not too often as to be ‘just another door’. The single, most negative thing, about this game that I can say is inventory, and stash management. Currently the Shared Stash of your characters is bugged (I assume it will be fixed soon). I’ve had page one ‘lose’ my gear twice so far. The biggest annoyance is passing gear from one character to another. It’s not well implemented, and is very tedious.If you’ve made it this far, well done. In summary? Well it’s a bit of a tricky one, with only thumbs up or thumbs down, since your opinion of this game will be (like most things) subjective. If you like the dungeon crawler, loot fest, with some grinding, then this may be for you. If you hold those things (or turn based combat) in a negative stead, then this will most likely not be for you.While it may seem that I have complained about many features, I would actually recommend this game. Simply put, I’ve had fun, and that’s what a game should be. The price point is perfect for what you get, in my opinion. I don’t see this being a game where you sink 300 hours in, and it’s probably not a game that you play as a ‘main’ game, but it’s something to pick up and enjoy. There are certain aspects that I would like to change, but overall I’m still playing and still enjoying.TL;DR: Top down dungeon crawler, very simple turn based combat, nice art style, lots of loot. Has a decent selection of characters, with 2 styles of either ‘ranged’ or ‘melee’. No puzzles or story/narrative. Has some quality of life issues such as inventory management, but overall offers a decent amount of entertainment for the price point."

Most of the negative reviews are due to the numerous bugs that rendered it nearly unplayable at launch. But the devs are constantly releasing patches and eliminating the bugs. The game, as of this review's date, is completely playable. I encountered no bugs during my 7 hours of play time.However there are some down sides to this game. Death mechanic makes the game a bit grindy and it might be frustrating in later levels. If your character dies, it gets prisoned at that level and you have to rescue them with another character. And if your main char outlevels the other ones by far, then you have to level up another character, which might take some time. On the other hand, this mechanic forces you to be cautious. You can't just storm through dungeons. You have to keep track of your consumables, you have to plan ahead before entering a fight, and sometimes it can be better to just exit the dungeon and try again, rather than push your luck. I'm also leveling 3 chars: 1 str, 1 agi and 1 int char. This way,  you can rescue your char as soon as it dies and you can make use of all the loot you get. Still, this prison thing is a bit harsh and I don't know whether I would start again if I lost all my chars in later parts of the game.Another downside is the merchant. Equipment purchase is like Diablo's gambling. You can't see the stats, you can't see the level requirement (though you get a hint from its cost). I believe we should be able to see the stats of equipments that we purchase and this ""gamble"" thing should be an extra option.Even with these negative aspects, the game is still fun and captivating. The fights are fun and it's not mindless button mashing; there are strategic elements to it, like positioning, pulling the mobs one by one, dealing with different types of mobs etc. I played most of the recent dungeon crawlers/board game type rpgs and Rezrog is way ahead of them.Tl,dr: The game in its current state is playable and any dungeon crawler/roguelike/rpg fan should definitely give it a try."

However this game scratches the dungeon crawler itch inside me. My son loves to watch me play and even named my brave group. I had a few rage quits but like all good games i couldn't help coming back for more. It should be said that it is heavly based on grinding so if you dont enjoy that type of game play then it would be best avoided. Rezrog suits me as it is a game i can jump on and play a run or two during my busy lifestyle."

So I restarted the game and it reset my progress and restarted the tutorial which wouldn't be that bad if I could actually click on a character. SO NOW every time I start the game it's at the beginning of the tutorial and I can't acutally play the game at all because I CAN'T CLICK ON ANYTHING.

If I encounter a dungeon with an issue, I just retreat and forfeit loot and experience.The game is a fairly standard grind/explore with generated dungeons.  You will have to perform one of about 5 mission types to complete a dungeon.   If you  run out of HP, you must rescue that character to have him/her back at tavern.  If all characters are lost, you restart with only the legacy bonus points you accrued.  The fun is when you are close to competing the dungeon and nearly out of supplies.  If you open the door you may be able to finish the level or get a beatdown.   This game has a similar tension factor to Darkest Dungeon.The interesting thing about this title is that your party will stratify when the first few  get good gear.  Once this happens,  you will have to decide whether to focus on your two or three power houses or to hold back your progress to get the whole team involved.  You can send the weaklings into new dungeons to find out how unknown enemies work and then rescue them with your elites.  One big bonus for this game is that you cannot just spam health/mana to get through.  I can see that causing some negative reviews.Update:  I have experienced the bug others are mentioning.  My experience is that the save file  is corrupt.  I see that it changes size to exaclty 76K from around 350-400k.  I have been able to keep playing by backing up the folder before I start so I only lose  minor progress.  I will keep review positive with the assumption that this will be patched at some point."

Most games require it on some level or another, but like so many other reviewers I had to repeat the first level many, many multiple times just to be able to reach the second level. Out of the four and a half hours as of this writing, *three and a half* of them were grinding alone.Everything else about this game is delightful... the art, the mechanics (so far as I've been able to advance enough to see how they work), the general presentation... but the grinding wears down any patience you may have. Unless you specifically *enjoy* playing the same map over and over, let this one sit in your wishlist for a while. But *DO* play it, aside from that one thing it is actually pretty fun and cute."

On the plus side it has some great artwork, on the negative the gear management in the shared stash is a bit of a PITA.  Another slight negative is that some rules are a bit obscure (like how dual weilding works and why movement speed is different for different characters).The real problem is that the game is just too buggy, and it seems to get worse as you progress through the levels.  In my first 50 or so runs I had maybe 2 crashes where combat just froze due to a bug.  A few levels later and I just can't get a clean run at all.  My last 5 runs have all had to be aborted for various bugs.  In one it was a creature using an unknown skill that just locked combat.  Another was a passageway that wouldn't let me though.  Another was a missing door (that prevents the next room from loading).  Another random combat lock, etc.It's pretty clear that the developers released the code prior to doing any serious testing.  They've released 3 patches in the last couple of weeks, so there is hope of it being fixed, but I'm less than 10% of the way through and can't progress any further.  I'll consider changing my review if/when the game becomes stable."
