I love the concept and ideas the developer had for the game, but after so long without updates or even responses on the discussion board the game feels dropped. If there are more updates and signs that the developer hasent given up and is working to deliver the features promised then I will change my review but as of right now this game feels abandoned."

It was a great Idea, but nothing is happening here. The game is still very basic.My original review:I really like it!Pro:- Magic the Gathering in VR! ... you know what I mean ;D- the basics work and even if it is a bit rough around the edges you can see a good foundation for future updatesCon:- totally ea, dont expect a full game, all you can do at the moment is a basic quickmatch against the ai without deckbuilding (there is around a dozen cards)It is a nice start, the content on release day will probably not entertain you for more then 20-30 minutes.  You can summon some creatures, cast some nice damage and armor spells, shot some arrows...sounds great right, but this really needs more content.Anyway, if you are like me, this is one of the concepts I dreamed of when buying my VR-headset. I dont regret my purchase at all and am eagerly waiting for the next update.Sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes, I am not a native speaker."

However, I know this is still EA but I haven't seen an update in a few months!!  Another game that I play which is in EA is QuiVR.  There's updates daily!  I feel like the person who developed this game took my $4.99 and ran off the Cancun and is sitting on the beach sipping tropical drinks all day.Things that I'd love to see more off....... a variety of cards, multi player, and deck building!  At least give us a quick statment on where your at in the stages of implementing things."

It has its own unique mechanic where you're provided a bow and sometimes arrows and you can shoot monsters or your opponent. I rarely buy steam games so I'm not sure if they go up in price but once this game gets fleshed out with PVP and more decks it'll be worth A LOT more than 5 bucks so I'd buy it now.It's a great concept that I've dreamt of since I was a kid watching Yu-gi-oh 10ish years ago and finally seeing it in action didn't disappoint I'm so excited for future content in this game."
76561198012337520,Recommended,548560,29095212,Posted: 7 January,all,HAPPY COWS!!,Great game with a great concept. The only problem here is getting a good solid amount of cards and the multiplayer and deck builder online. If you can do those things this game will be the most popular card game in vr and the only one of its kind.It's very promising and I hope the developer puts in the effort.
76561198104914250,Not Recommended,548560,28996958,Posted: 3 January,all,Drasome,It had a lot of potential but now it feels abandoned. It has been months since the last response from the dev and we only had one update which wasn't a major one. I hate to give it a negative review but at the current state I do not recommend it.
,Recommended,548560,29136777,Posted: 9 January,all,toothpick_jack,"Let me first preface by introducing myself. I'm a Swedish card game enthusiast with 20+ years of MtG experience and been playing Hearthstone since beta. I also enjoy games such as Netrunner. Obviously, I also like VR. Especially the Vive.My take on this game is that it has a lot of potential. The basic system is very similar to Hearthstone. You have a deck of cards, a new mana crystal each turn and some abilities that are exactly the same as Hearthstone (charge for instance). The twist to the game as I experience it is in the unique VR features that differentiate ManaStorm from regular card games. Just like Hearthstone does things with RNG (such as summoning random minions) which just aren't possible with a paper card game, ManaStorm leverages the unique capabilities of virtual reality to add an extra layer to the game.Here are a few examples:* You start each game with a bow and a fire arrow (you can get more arrows through cards). This arrow can be used at any point in the game to deal one point of damage to an enemy minion, BUT only if you can hit it with your bow. This adds an element of dexterity and skill to your play.* One of the cards gives you a beam of searing light to wield for a turn. This beam spreads damage to anything you point it at for four seconds. There is currently a damage cap, but the idea of allowing the player's skill in handling this spell determine it's effectiveness is exciting to me.* You start each game with a shield, which can be triggered once to reduce damage. Currently it's a one-off and blocks every time you activate it. But adding an element of skill would be possible here as well. Timing your blocks to shield you from attacks and allowing critical blocks would be great gameplay.The creator of Manastorm has shown the ability to mix potions on the battlefield as a future feature. This also looks like an exciting feature if done correctly. The key to all of these features is to put the player under pressure to perform them. The way Hearthstone works is with a 90-second turn limit. If you're expected to play cards, assign attacks, shoot arrows and mix potions all in a minute and a half, I can see this being an exciting foundation for good game play.The game is now in it's early stages (pre-access that feels like early beta). And depending on how big the creators want to make it, their ambition might exceed their grasp. CCGs are very demanding in terms of content, balancing and gameplay. With a 3D model and voice lines for each card, that's a lot of work and the game is currently quite rudementary in comparison to other CCGs. I wish the very best for this game, and hope that they have the courage and tenacity to follow through on what they've set out to do. You have my $5 and my support. Let's make this happen!Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Daggasoft. I have not been given a review code or been incentivized in other ways to write this review.tldr; It's like Hearthstone but with fire arrows"
,Recommended,548560,29053087,Posted: 5 January,all,Abysmal Helix,"Being an MTG Player I will say that this game concept is absolutely amazing. Unfortunately, this is merely a demo at this point.Pros:* Interface is well done, very intuitive gameplay.* Animations are well done, quick, and to the point; which is good considering youll be seeing a lot of the same animations over and over.* Graphics are good and the game runs great on my mid-end VR PC.* Gameplay is fun and engaging.* This could easily end up being a very popular game when VR really starts to take off if they do a good job with it.Cons:* Inability (or no formal directions on how) to allow your creatures to block when your hero is targetted. This system is too easy to manipulate and just bombard the enemy with attacks and spells to win easily anytime. I particularly like the MTG blocking system over Hearthstone taunting system, and I feel like the devs should mimic the MTG blocking system because people who want to play hearthstone will just play that if they like that system better anyways. Or come up with a new system, but either way there needs to be a system in place or it throws all strategy out the window and leaves the game with much to be desired.* It is basically a demo at the current time. All you can do is play against an AI that is not very intelligent at all. Needs more content (which I am sure they are working on) I will update this review as I look into the game in the future.* Couldn't figure out how to fire arrows with the card that gives 3 arrows in game. Needs better direction on how.Regardless of the cons, I am impressed and excited for this game. Truly hoping it becomes something great. The devs should focus the most on card array, deck building, and AI/Blocking system at the moment and get those solidified before even attempting to work on multiplayer, since there isnt a huge VR community at the current time."
,Recommended,548560,28995479,Posted: 3 January,all,likecookies,It is an EA but a very promising one even with the few cards (a dozen or so) the game is very fun and once you get the hang of it you will be loving it.Is one of the best VR experiences I have had on the Rift.Works great with Rift and Touch controllers even with a 2 sensor setup the room scale works very well. Once the multiplayer and deck building is complete this will be a must have for any Magic fans... Don't be afraid to try it for the price it is worth is on VR game you wont regret.

,Recommended,548560,29261426,Posted: 14 January,all,ViRusS,I think this game has great potential. The problem is there is no depth to the game right now. I am also having an issue where it isn't tracking my wins and losses.I think this game could be amazing and I think it is a steal for the price.
76561198072994774,Recommended,548560,29235575,Posted: 13 January,all,diggidee,It's a good start and I know that the VR industry is still in it's infancy but it does need more gameplay. I hope the developers keep improving it. Overall for £4 I can't complain

76561198042198830,Recommended,548560,33350658,Posted: 7 July,all,MabiVsGames,"Manastorm Gameplay/Review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5s2nTnR4zIManastorm: Champions of G'nar is an early access VR game that gives players an experience like non-other! Akin to games like Magic The Gathering, Hearthstone, and Yu-Gi-Oh, Manastorm: Champions of G'nar aims to immerse users in a card game come to life! You are basically a Planeswalker, controlling the battlefield and dueling an opponent to destroy their life points! Matches include actions such as: Throwing cards from your hand to summon minions and activate spells, real time blocking with shields to prevent damage, and interacting with offensive options like shooting a bow and firing a beam of energy to clear the board! At the time of this review, there are only a handful of cards available to you, a simple quick match against an AI with a similiar deck, and no way to progress or customize your decks. Manastorm: Champions of G'nar for the HTC Vive has immense potential and I really hope to see this game be continued to be worked on! Any fan for the aforementioned games will no doubt have a good time trying this game out!"

But unfortunately there are some game breaking bugs present that stop you picking things up or interacting in general.

It's unplayable as is.Adding vitrual hands so you can see where you're grabbing would be useful, takes about 1-3 min just to pick up a card or an arrow because it wont grab it or just drops it randomly."

,Recommended,548560,29134765,Posted: 8 January,all,mariemariemusic,"I'll be upfront that I am not a CCG person. I have several hours logged with Magic: The Gathering, but nothing like the diehard players. However, I've always thought VR would be a great space for it, because the cards could come to life, and that is exactly what these developers have done. While the experience is currently quite small, the idea and mechanics are in place and very well done. I expect it to grow tremendously.I will point out that while the game uses room scale, there is no need for it, and as a VR dev myself, I would provide the option to not have it. If you just lowered the tables, I would be able to sit comfortably and play. As the game grows, I see the sessions taking a while. You might as well let your players not get fatigued from standing for an hour. Clearly this game is perfect for Mobile, which I am sure the devs have in mind. It should be a huge success.Check it out!!"
