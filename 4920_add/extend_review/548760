,Recommended,548760,26362531,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,HammeredToast,"I'm a pro photographer and videographer, and most of my work revolves around things that typically happen in big indoor or outdoor venues. I say ""pro"" in that I'm paid. I am obviously not the best in this business, even by a long-shot. Take my opinions with a grain of salt.I subscribe to the Adobe Creative Suite. It's essential for me, even though, for the most part, I just take the images. I rarely ever get stuck in post, though sometimes I wish I would. Unfortunately, that just isn't our workflow. I'm just a guy taking pretty'ish pictures.I don't like Lightroom. I find it to be poorly laid out and in general, it's workflow just doesn't work out for me. Everyone else likes it and loves it, but with Adobe CC, I adore Bridge and Photoshop. I augment that package with quick colour edits, correction and grading, in Camerabag 2.CB2 has served me well since it was released. It's quick, snappy, and intuitive, and everything is a mask, so it's easy to deal with. If I had problems to pick with it, it'd be that it hadn't really been updated in sometime. To that regard, Camerabag Photo has been released, and while it shares a lot of the GUI of CB2, it helps it along by feeling even more snappy on lesser hardware, like my recently purchased Zenbook with 8Gb of RAM and an i5 proc. Further, CBP has arranged things in a way that makes just a bit more sense, as well as dealt with some issues of smaller, high-density pixel monitors. For instance, scaling of fonts and UI was an issue when I still owned a Surface Pro 3.CBP and CB2 seem adequtly priced for what they are, but honestly, if it wasn't for the deep discount I got 4 years ago, I wouldn't have purchased CB2. If it wasn't for my steep Steam Card discount for already owning CB2, I wouldn't have purchased the license for CBP. That being said, if you want to avoid big branded Adobe products or if you get these things on sale, they are good, solid applications. I truly enjoy them. Just remember that if it wasn't for the discounts, they are non-essential purchases for a photographer."

,Not Recommended,548760,27874362,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,◢ k r i s ◤,"Avoid like the plague!!!!!!!!!!Will not open any files, period. Some say it used to only load images from the C:\ drive - this is no longer true, if it ever really were. You could try to load a file from 'C:\myPhoto.jpg' and it will not work. I've tried tiff, jpg, png, psd, gif, ora - NOTHING works. Even if it did - who keeps images on their C Drive? People usually have secondary disk drives and file servers to store images if they work with a lot of storage requirements.Non-existant support. Every email anyone sends apparently gets ignored(info@nevercenter.comorsupport@nevercenter.comare both valid addresses). The Steam discussion board are a joke if you go there for support. The software is apparently 2 years old at least and, though updated from time to time, it continues to preserve issues and bugs that have never been addressed.So again - avoid like the plague. There is a free trial on the Nevercenter website that I would recommend trying first - but I don't. This software sucks. Move along now and don't waste your time.If you bought it and it seems to not be working for you - close the software and avoid running it for very long. Go to your Steam purchase history and request a refund. As long as you are under 2 hours ofplaytime, Steam should honor your refund request."

Official twitter and steam forums are silent, and negative reviews are accumulating on steam page. Hasn't been updated in a while despite issues.-Other users are suffering from a variety of problems, see other reviews.I want to believe that Nevercenter isn't here to grab cash and run, but they aren't doing a good job proving their dedication to providing quality products that work for their users.ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)"
76561197968843616,Recommended,548760,26366035,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,Imba™,"Camerabag Photo Basically Camerabag 3.0.Nice upgrade to what is one of the best kept secret apps around.  I have a full version of Adobe Creative Cloud and time and again I would reach for Camera Bag 2 vs Lightroom because it just so much quicker to use, with a much better GUI!CB 3.0 seems to have some real upgrades under the hood with far more options and presets than 2.0.  It works better with 21:9 Displays and ultra HD screens (seems to scale the UI better now).   And although it won't totally replace the need for stuff like Lightroom for pro' work, it is a very handy tool to have installed for fast results.So for correcting scanned or digital photos or adjusting them for use online there really isn't anything free or paid to rival CB 3 for price or speed of use.  I got a discount as a CB2 owner to upgrade, so was a total no brainer for me! But even at full price vs the subs to pay for lightroom-PS per month it's worth thinking about or watching for a sale on steam.Great for laptop use in while 'out and about' with very low hardware needs. Works great on Win 10 64 bit on a multiscreen ultra HD system no issue.Key New features:Spit Screen 'tabs' to load the original image (horzontically or vertically) and then see the changes you are making in realtime.  New hotkeys.  Colour grading wheels and bit of extra work on the Shadows adjustment side.  And loads of new Presets.  Plus you can now use your own images for picture borders or as a 'watermark' (Branding logo) with basic scale-anchor-opacity controls.Two thumbs up from me."

Thumb down for that.I will update my review when time comes. :)"
,Recommended,548760,34070751,Posted: 6 August,all,Ukuli,Let's make one thing clear: I love this program.Why? It's easy to use and quick for everyday photoediting as well as giving special touch for 3d renders and artwork alike. Bunch of customizable filters offer nicely variation.It seems that I might be only user around here who hasn't had not a single one crashing issue. I really mean it. Program hasn't crashed Not. Even.Once.

,Recommended,548760,26527225,"Posted: 10 November, 2016",all,iamgotharts,"An honest review:Today I get an 80% off discount in my inbox for CameraBag photo since I bought camerabag 2. I Bought for $10.00!Super awesome....So I compared the two softwares by opening both at the same time.First, Both opened and ran perfectly...no problems. No errors. perfection. Havent tried to open one photo in camera bag then export it to the other. Going to try this, will update if this works or not.First Camerabag photo has some of the basic features that came with camerabag 2. Once you get over that then you should be fine.  HOWEVER, This is why I love both... Camerabag photo has a better UI interface. everything is ORGANIZED BY CLICKABLE FOLDERS!  E.G Advance light, Film tone, etc and you can hide them when your not using itSecond: They have expanded more Options for creativity.  They have emulated film stocks and film techinques that are almost perfection. If your a film photographer that scans their work in and use programs like these to edit work This is great because ....you can achieve the same affects in a darkroom.... without going thru the trouble of a darkroom....Third The price is great for 39.99. I paid 10.00 but they give you so much. i feel like they should charge more. There are more options than the original."

It had some great fine tuning tools, but it constantly crashes and is unusable.  I'm really disappointed, used to be great.****Orinigal review:I got CB Photo on an 80% discount because I had CB2.  So far, a nice UI improvement and alot of control over your editing.  Will this replace photoshop, paintshop pro, affinity, or others.  No.  How I use this program:I edit my photos and touch them up with PSP or Affinity and get them to a nice ""traditional"" look for my clients.  I will then take the final edits and open them into CB Photo.  I then add extra filters, adjustments, and colors to give it a more ""creative and artsy"" feel.  The process is really quick and effective.This program does have a lot of cool features about it.  It doens't do everything, but what it does do, it does great.  It has a lot of filters with previews.  I really like the fact that everything that can be edited can be done so with exactness.  There are sliders and scales for all the adjustments and edits so you can fine tune your photo to your hearts desire.As I said before, it does a great job getting some extra filters and adjustment to my photos.  Ive seen in some review that people have had trouble opening their files, but I have had 0 issues.  I have all my photos in JPG and RAW format.  I've never had an issue."
