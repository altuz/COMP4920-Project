However, it's missing 2 stars because I did not like the fact that you can't move around the furniture and decors once you've placed it down. Also the last level, the sound is buggy. Even though I've lowered it to almost nothing, whenever I clicked on the buttons, there's a loud pinging noise."

I really enjoy the gameplay of it, it's not like a regular tycoon game on a phone or android where you just tap for coins; theres recipes, goals, different coffee shop levels, and the best part is that it's in alpha stage, once it releases I expect there to be more levels, more recipes, and better 2D placement. The only concern I had was, that on the mall stage it wouldn't let me progress to the next shop, the progression bar would go up, and the robot you'd click was not there, almost as it wasn't even there. I spent about 1-2 hours on that shop just to have to restart. Other than that, this game is fun to play if you have nothing to do, or just want a new variety of gaming.MY VIEW--------------Well. It's pretty obvious you can see that I played this game a LOT heh, I literally stopped playing rocket league/cs:go to finish all the levels, it was quite amusing. Out of my 15 games on steam I'd consider this as a top 3-4. If you are bored out of your mind, and you already completed the game; go for all the achievements / create new store designs and share them with the community.SUGGESTIONS------------------------#1. Firstly, i'd like to point out that once you complete all 4-6 shops the game obviously ends, so what now? I'd reccomend a multiplayer one versus one, such as the last shop where you have a coffee shop and another player has a coffee shop next to you.#2. Honostly, we ""all"" wanted this: Avatar Customization; customize your avatar's gender, hair, clothes etc. #2.5. Make hidden avatar items, such as sunglasses that you'd have to get by completing a certain level, or placing this amount of furniture or getting all the recipes etc.#3. ""Could use some work"": Firstly, it doesn't make sense why there isn't a janitor in this game, the mall janitor employee on it's description says it would clean up trash for you, however there is no trash in that level; make janitors/cleaners able to be in your coffee shop for levels 2+.#4. Bathrooms. You could use some bathrooms for customers, like there bladder would be full from coffee (not my favorite suggestion).#5. More save slots; Personally, I want to have a save slot for each level so I can go back there etc. i'd reccomend doing 5-10 save slots for the game; not just 1 autosave and save file.BUGS---------Personally, the game is only $5.00, so it's pretty cheap for some people. However there's always this one thing that you would hate about the game: Bugs.There's not that many bugs in this game, however i'll tell you some bugs i've encountered.#1. Pretty common: Game/Character freezing. Personally, I haven't encountered this however I have had 3-5 game freezes that come back after about 10-20 seconds. This is why you have to save every 5-15 minutes!#2. Pretty uncommon: Mall Level; robot freezing-progression bar going up. Basically, your about to complete the mall level, well you can't because the ""sue"" bar is at 100%? So where the heck is the robot? If you can't see with your bare eyes try spam-clicking behind chalk boards, LED Advertisement screens etc. they can be hidden behind those. However, i've encountered this problem 4 times, for some reason on my last attempt I did not hire ANY employees, and the game went great; no bugs on that level. If your still having this issue, try cheatcode ""IDDQD"" on the main menu to skip over to the next level.#3. Pretty rare: Cutscene freezing; for example: i've had my cutscene freeze on the last level ending, had to restart and it still wouldn't work. I used the cheatcode ""IDDQD"" to skip over to the ""Finale"" to overcome my bug.#4. Extremely Rare: Screen fading to black on ""sea"" level not fading back. I've encountered this ONCE. Basically, the screen fades to black when you completed the level however nothing happens, I waited about 2-5 minutes but nothing happened. I had a save at the end so luckily I didn't need to use a cheat code or restart.#5. Mixed: Music bugging out, personally this bug is at no way affecting gameplay however it'd be nice if the developer(s) fixed this issue.CHEAT CODES-----------------------#1. ""IDDQD"" - Level Select#2. ""TCL"" - Toggle Clipping#3. ""LargeBoomHypothesis"" - Hit TV Sitcom Mode (not really sure what this does)#4. ""DLC"" - DLC Mode#5. ""ABACABB"" - Paintball Mode (turns trash into paint, however you can't pick it up nor does the ""health grade"" go down/up, but there is a goal you need to achieve ""Pick up 75 pieces of trash"" to progress to the next level, currently this makes it unable for you to progress to the next level, so i'd reccomend not using this until you have gotten all the achievements you wanted.#6. ""UUDDLRLRBA"" - Unlock all Recipe Hints (you get all the recipes unlocked, you don't need to pay $35 to unlock one. however, you DO need to make the recipes (sadly).)#7. ""CashForBeans""  - (Infinite Cash).Special Thanks to @Ricethin [Developer]  for replying on a post with these cheat codes!

76561197962984046,Not Recommended,549240,33439186,Posted: 10 July,all,-=STG=- link_108 [pD],"I would not recommend this game; it is NOT in early access and STILL has game breaking bugs.I enjoyed this game at first, but then it started to get pretty repetitive. I continued to play because the story was ok, but then there was a game breaking bug that halted my progress. In level with the drones that spy on you, I saved, quit the game, and the next time the game started, the spy bar kept filling up without any drones around, so I couldn't complete the level. This is made worse by the fact that there is only an autosave slot and a regular slot, so I had no clean / earlier saves to work with."
76561198328061484,Recommended,549240,33392537,Posted: 8 July,all,maddylena,"I erred on the side of recommendation, even though I'm not fully confident it's worth the full price for everyone in the state it is now. But I'll be likely replaying it many times, so this is subject to change. Yes, there are bugs. Do check the community page, where developers has shared some advice- and no, the warp code does not mess with the achievements. Don't think of it as the cheat, think of it as a fix. Ignore the obnoxious ""cheater"" in the menu involved. (If you're going to call people out, fulfill your side of the bargain - a fully polished game, that mystical unicorn of gaming industry - first.)When I say I'll be replaying it many times, it isn't because I'm invested in following the fixes - it's because the game is what I was looking for. Really low pressure, basically unchallenging, but still letting you feel a sense of accomplishment. Mind you, this might displease someone who prefers challenge. If it had windowed mode, it would be perfect for multitasking, which is another thing I was looking for - as it is, it's easy to switch with Alt-Tab without experiencing problems so it still serves the purpose somewhat.Even if you aren't into multitasking, you might wish you were able to run it in the background at times, because there are quite a few rather slow moments. Some levels mitigate this by adding additional problems to handle, but not all (and even there, the frequency of interferences seems to be random or at least unevenly paced). Even then, the level of challenge is really low. Also, I'm a bit iffy about the order in which they pop up - the ones I found a bit challenging to deal with come near the start and in the middle. You'd think there would be difficulty progression. The progression does make sense narratively (the framing devices for said difficulties being key parts of the story), but I feel there was a way to have both things.Despite this, I was only really disappointed in the final level. Without going into the details (just general structure),it has two sub-levels. The second one seems to be reached once a criterion you have no real influence over is fulfilled, regardless of whether you fulfilled your progress goals or not. You get new goals and setup provided. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad the game hasn't decided to throw in a last-minute huge difficulty bump, but it's rather unsatisfying. I wish you had an opportunity to finish those goals, or have them reflected in the second part in some way. And I feel like the final level should have had a complication like the added difficulty levels I mentioned above had. And maybe a bit more to do in the final stage.That said, while this review ended up sounding rather critical, I still really enjoyed this game. Devs have hinted at the possibility of additional content (for Halloween at least), so it looks like it will be worth coming back to for more than just a revisit. I also really liked the humor and the concept, which delivered all I was expecting and more.If you want a really low-pressure tycoon game, if you like North American coffee shop culture - or just like poking fun at it, if you want to run into an obvious in hindsight but pleasantly surprising character suspiciously close to a certain celebrity - this is a game for you. Maybe not at a full price yet, depending on your spending criteria, but do keep track of it."

The bugs have prevented me from progressing at all (either the robots stop showing up but the bar continues to go up, or they do show up and when I click them the bar goes up anyway), and every time I restart it I keep having the same issues. I kept trying because I love the concept of the game, but after I lost track of how many times I tried to get through this level without success due to the bugs I have given up. Overall though, great game, fun to play, and hopefully these bugs are fixed!"

Passed it in couple hours.Should mention theres some bugs. Some items when researching, wont appear and transfer. Sometimes you get the research right and says is wrong.  If you place 2 items pretty close or over, they will get stuck together.Real lot of dialog that isnt really important and cant really skip, i think is there to waste time and make the game look larger.I don't think it worths the price."

76561198137830097,Recommended,549240,33525054,Posted: 13 July,all,squishytrishy,"Think The Sims, but with coffee shops. This is the me-ist game I've ever purchased. And yes, it's riddled with bugs, but that doesn't warrant bad reviews. (It really doesn't - I finished this game despite the bugs. There are cheat codes you can use to warp to the otherwise unreachable subsequent levels, and you'll find ways around the glitches. More on that later.) These bugs are definitely a shame, but I beg you to stick with it, or at least pick it up again when the patch rolls around. It is so worth playing.The storyline is absurd. I love it. Gameplay is peppered with memes and mickey-taking, and it's worth taking the time to watch the cut scenes and read all the little tidbits of humour. The amount of work that went into this is just incredible - while the graphics aren't mindblowing (and I love that, to be honest), other aspects are laden with little details that make this game so fun.Anyway - cheats. IDDQD was a life saver (warp to any level without losing your achievements) because during the cut scene at the end of the boardwalk level, one of the characters just gets stuck, and there appears to be no other way around it. In the mall level you must destroy drones to move on - well, these drones have a habit of turning invisible. As there's only one save file, saving the game with an invisible drone on the loose means you can't complete the level (unless you use the warp cheat). But I think the bug that causes this is pretty random, as I managed to surpass the level by saving the game every time I successfully killed a drone. If I got caught out by an invisible one, I simply quit and began from my last save point - and from then on, the drones never appeared at exactly the same time or place. It's a slow solution, but it works.Believe me, this game will be better when the glitches are ironed out. I just want to defend it, though, because it is still absolutely hilarious and so enjoyable. The downtown level made me cry with laughter intermittently. Honestly, it's worth working through the glitches just to have Yasmar von Nodrog call you a donkey.Give this game a chance! It's glorious!"

I was surpised by the pressure I felt keeping the balance between pouring your cash into new decor to attract new business, researching new products to create more profitable drinks, focusing on attending to unhappy customers, and maintaining a high health code score. Great work, looking forward to updates."

I had so much fun seeing my little customer's grabbing coffee, reading the hiliarous dialogue and completing the challenges.I personally love this style of game but it is definitelty not for everyone; also the bugs!!  The developer is working on a patch to address some of them with more to follow but it can be quite frustrating.  The game itself isn't overly long, you could probably complete the whole thing in four hours or less.  It doesn't have a whole lot of replayability either.  Once you have the achievs and finished the storyline you're totes done.Having said all of that; this game is charming!!  It's original, the pixel art is so cute and the characters are absolutely hiliarious.  This is the perfect game to cuddle up with late at night or early in the morning with a big cup of coffee."

,Recommended,549240,33601589,Posted: 16 July,all,ruu2adsilsy,"This game is very fun but VERY short. I beat it in about 5 hours. I wish the gameplay was a bit more varied and increased in difficulty more than it did without the tedium of trying to guess your way through recipes (you have to put ingredients/machines together to create crazy coffee recipes that usually involves a pun to sell to your customers that sometimes throw trash all over the floor).I honestly ended up purchasing most of the recipes because I found myself liking the tycoon aspect of building up the coffee shop and making money, buying furniture/decor etc much more than the repetitave and time consuming process of guessing recipes. This game is fun but I feel like it isn't fledged out or going in the direction to be as fun as it could be. I think if this game were more focused on the building aspect with some form of automatic recipe unlocking at certain objectives/tiers, it would feel more rewarding and enjoyable. As it stands, the story line is pretty short but cute and the game is enjoyable with its quirks.I also really appreciate and admire the developer that is actually active on the forums as far as bug reporting goes.

There's scenes not triggering, there's the bugs I've gotten too as well as my fiance... It's still fun. It's still damn fun, but prepare yourself if you're going in. If at all possible is there a place to report these bugs?I'm unable to get past the second area because seating is in the way the captain wants to go by one pixel I'll bet. I've replayed it about five times, all the way through to that point and he's still stuck on random crap. Even when I move it he finds a way like nature.Pros:Everything else not in cons. It's a clever game with a really neat discovery concept in the menu for the stores that I really like. The game seems fun from what I've been able to play, I don't even mind the music and normally I just shut that right off the moment I get any game. Some of the humour I've found not so funny as they're jabs for no reason, but there are some other funny elements.Cons:- I've broken this game about 90 times just trying to place an object, I'm still going to give it a thumbs up but watch out for that. I keep getting told it's my computer, but it's likely my luck. I don't think a game's code and core functioning exists as a 'my computer' problem. I've restarted, restarted, restarted and even re-installed. Don't know how to submit the bugs because I'm still trying to struggle to play the game let alone want to fish around to do that.- There needs to be a skip the tutorial or things we've played before or recognizing that we've done a level, as soon as something breaks I have to play the first level all over again and it's getting old instead of fun and I want desperately to have fun with this game. I'm still leaving it as a yes recommended but with those above things so far.- Doesn't remember my volume settings. I don't like having my ears blasted every single time I have to restart it responsibly by the means the game wants me to.- Please God don't let the savestates just save over one another, have two or three. That would've saved things that were out of my hands a million times.All in all still leaving it as a yes, but if you happen to catch one of the bugs that I did, then prepare yourself."

For a $5 game it was well worth the purchase for me. I enjoyed the silly story and charming characters. This game lacks the depth of most sim/tycoon games that I've played, particularly with the recipe discovery mechanics where the fee to experiment generally tends to make the full recipe purchase price more cost effective (especially with so many potential appliance combinations). However, that was a minor thing and overall I really enjoyed this game when I wanted to just chill and serve up a Deep Fried Espresso and some Sugar Bombs.Initially I encountered a series of game-breaking bugs, but the developer has been working hard to patch the game up and ever since the last patch my game is no longer suffering from any of those bugs.
