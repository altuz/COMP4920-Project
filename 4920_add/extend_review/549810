It expects you to collectALLcarrots/acorns. If you missed one, the door just won't open same thing if you ran out of time. And you'll have to keep trying and trying until you get all of them. Q.Q Good luck! )o)"
,Recommended,549810,32353561,Posted: 11 June,all,Mr.RamiroZ,"I recommend. Disadvantages, which significantly spoiled the game, is the speed and mechanics of the player's movement so poor that you instinctively try to press the keys harder, even your hand gets tired. Levels are complex puzzles, saving settings is not. Hardcore game in which you really need to carefully remember the whole level, otherwise you just can not pass. A beautiful drawing creates the atmosphere of a child's toy, but did not bring to it, under this nyashnostyu fierce unruffled hell. As a fan of dandy games, where I had to remember everything the same way, I really liked it.6/10"

Bunny & Piggy is a minimalist platformer made by Russian developer Brzezinski. To date, it's their only game. Here's how they describe their work:We love to dream and strive to realize our dreams in games. A game is a small world which everyone can dive into, even just for a while. Let us try to create as much as possible of such cozy worlds!And what kind of world is Bunny & Piggy? From the outside, it looks minimalistic and cute. But when you delve into the game, it becomes a metaphor for self-destruction and struggle.You see, there's only one kind of person who will love Bunny & Piggy: people who like to die. A lot. To call this a ""hard"" platformer does not do this game justice. This game does not allow for mistakes. And even if it doesn't look like you're making a mistake, you'll make a mistake. Over and over again, and you'll you can't fix your mistakes because you only have 30 seconds to complete most levels.Bunny & Piggy gives you just that little bit of hope. Yes, you'll die but should you pass just the first level, you'll find a transcendent joy that makes you feel like a god-damned genius. But it's all for naught. The next level will surely murder you over and over again. Its cuteness gives you no respite.Let me talk about the graphics for a brief moment. If you're nostalgic for Flash games, you'll like this. The asthetic is stripped down and minimalistic. Both characters are represented as coloured squares with smooth corners. The obstacles are made up of circles and squares. You'll come across various enemies that will give you a one touch death, but they're rendered simplistically.As for the audio? Oh boy. If you play this, mute it -- which is what I did. It deserved a better soundtrack. Something that represented its philosophy more. Perhaps something like Joy Division or The Manic Street Preachers. Something that represents the dread of dying over and over again.This game doesn't require much as far as hardware is concerned. If you have an Intel Core 2 CPU and 1GB of RAM, you should run this fine.Perhaps it's the booze talking, but Bunny & Piggy took me on a whirlwind journey. There were moments I felt like crying, but when I managed to win a level, it was like an injection shot of ecstasy. And just as quickly, I'd come crashing down, wondering about the futility of it all. Why do we, as humans, put ourselves through these lonely tests of mental fortitude -- and what is there to show for it?But what is Bunny & Piggy trying to say to us? One clue is at its Steam store description:Frosty winter is coming and you have to gather as much food as possible.So why exactly is a rabbit gathering carrots that are bound to spoil, and a pig gathering acorns which it *cannot* digest? And why must this be done within 30 seconds? This game is a comment on capitalism and consumer culture, how we tend to plunder for goods, looking for the quick exit.For what end? Death. Yes, you can try again. And every so often, you'll find success. But isn't this all just a way to amuse ourselves before the inevitable? This reminds me of a quote by the great Marcel Proust:Do not wait for life. Do not long for it. Be aware, always and at every moment, that the miracle is in the here and now."

,Recommended,549810,32206362,Posted: 5 June,all,leafegreens,"Bunny & Piggy is an adorable 2D platformer. Yes, the game is deceptively difficult, but it never felt unfair to me, which is my major complaint with most of the ""challenging platformers"" out there on the market. Levels also reset very quickly upon death, which helps to keep mistakes from feeling *too* punishing.Add in the trading cards and a bunch of rare achievements and this game is a winner in my book. (Seriously, most of the achievements have a 2% acquisition rate or less).  To me, a price of $0.99 feels about right for this game, so if you're thinking about purchasing it you may want to wait for a coupon or a sale. Just make sure that you understand that this game is difficult. Bunny & Piggy may be a game with cute graphics, but it's far from a casual game."

,Not Recommended,549810,31926050,Posted: 23 May,all,みoƦƦoƦ ₣o父,"Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Platform game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou are only able to toggle ALL SOUND+mUSIC.No volume sliders.There are some different languages available.You can choose between fullscreen or windowed mode.You are able to play the game with a xbox controller.About the game.So you are able to choose between a piggy square block or a bunny square block. The only difference between them is the food. You will need to eat all of the food within the 30 second time limit and dying to open the exit door. Your character will die in a single hit if it has been touched by an enemy and forces you to restart the level over again. As much as i like to play platform games. This one is pretty bad as the game only contains ""moving platforms"" that are raising up and down or left and right. That is basically the game, you jump onto moving platforms timing it right and get to the goal or eating the food.There are around 28 levels.Meh music.Their is only ""eating food"" sound.Gameplay is pretty basic and easy to understand.Is repetitive.Could be annoying.90% of the game contains only moving platforms.Other things.There are better platform games but i guess 1 buck seems reasonable for this game.-------------------I Give this game a 4/10"
