I actually really liked the characters and the writing.  And it's a rollercoaster of emotions packed into that 1.5 hours -- I sincerely felt happy, sad, and even panicked in various playthroughs.  Great game for the price."

That seemed a better way of saying it than, 'Never remind me of this, for fear I should stick a knife in you.” ― Mary Renault,The Persian BoyOne Night Standis the first VN coming from indie developer Kinmoku. It is a short and completely awkward experience as it should be. This short story holds plenty of mysteries, most sadly left unrevealed. Would it be worthy of your 3 dollars? Well, I'd say to grab it on a discount, 'cause even though it is a nice little game, there are quite so many 1 dollar games out there with more content and some more decent story revelations.We wake up with the buzzing of our phone, mostly hammered from the other night and left with an impending hangover. Our buddy, Gary is apparently a bit angry at us, claiming that we ditched him pretty hard last night. When we regain our sense of sight, we notice that this is not our room. Wait, this is not our bed and we have no idea who would be the ashen blond girl sleeping beside us. Who is she? What actually happened the other night? What to do in this most awkward of situations?I do not know if anyone of you ever had a one night stand, but if enough alcohol is involved, this game presents a pretty good example of how you can end up by the morning. From that point onwards, you gotta make a choice: either to stay and endure an ordeal of gathering the pieces of what happened and try to attach some meaning into the messy results of animal instinct; or gather your belonging, take a run for the door, dodging any awkwardness that may be attached to a probable conversation and hope that your choice won't be making you a despicable human being. It's not an easy position, is it? This short game presents you this exact dilemma.From the moment you wake up, you are to make a series of choices, in this alien environment. There is no actual mission here. Depending on the way you decided to deal with this situation - you may run for the door, engulf in the awkwardness, act like a pervert or actually become interested in the girl - you'll pursue a different playthrough and get a different ending. The game harbors 12 different endings, and adding the option to skip already read text, you can complete the whole game within 2 hours or so.Now, the main problem with the game is that it lacks some probable content. Main mysteries of the game are never revealed, like her actual name, her relationship with her brother, whomever was writing her on FB, what exactly transpired between her and Gary etc. You gather some clues, act on instinct and go for an ending as heartwarming or as shameful it can be. Sure, the relationship between two parties is already superficial and it is more than logical that most details would not be revealed. But I'd love to see at least an epilogue to fill the blanks presented during the gameplay. I don't know, a ""they ended up like this"" scenario at least, or a new detail about her past revealed in each playthrough. That would be intriguing. As it is, it is not a bad game but it feels like the plot revelation is left halfway to maintain mystery. It might be just me, but I'm allergic to those.The artwork and animations are really basic yet beautiful, by the way. They are presented in flowing sepia tones with pastel shade coloring. Our ""lady friend"" seems lifelike with all her emotions, her awkwardness, her sensuality and her fear that this might be a mistake. You can read all these from her body language and mimics. Soundtrack is rather nice, but I wouldn't call it exceptional.Coming to the last word,One Night Standis a nice, short and semi-satisfactory VN - and a considerably well-done work for a first trial in the genre. I do expect to see more works coming from Kinmoku in the future. Cheers!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

Overall, it left me really unsatisfied as it hinted at something epic, only to finish mildly.Perhaps the lukewarm nature of this all-too-shortlived experience was intended(its a game centred around awkwardness after all) but I have doubts about that. The intriguing mystery as to what happened the night before and who the woman is never really resolved in any of the endings and seems to me to be tacked on to hold a player's interest.Trying to get to all 12 endings also starts to become boring as quite a few of the options given to the player all lead to the same outcome-- which is not very good form in visual novels IMO.TLDR; I would say not enough content-- not enough choices, not enough depth, even for its relatively low price. For a dollar or two more I could easily buy a game that lasts 12 hours or more while this took me 1 hour to complete all endings and left me dissatisfied and wondering what the heck happened (perhaps this game is trying to induce a morning after hangover effect in the player :p)"

There are twelve different endings with seemingly infinite amounts of variables, and the whole thing just feels genuine.I'd also like to add how perfectly the animated rotoscoped visuals work, as well as the whole color scheme and ""mood"" of the art in general.

That's really the summary for this game: not only is the premise mature, but it makes you feel genuine emotion for these two digital lost souls. The subject matter is so personal and private that it pushes you out of the comfort zone of ""just a video game"".It deals with sex in a way that games just don't. It's compelling and holds no punches. There is no easy deus ex narrative here. No clear path for our hero. In a media inundated with ""grey choices"" (lol Witcher series) and ""reactive choices"", this game's basically on-the-rails choices are friggin' toe curling. Because the situation is REAL. It's not ""should I free this wood elf"" or ""do I take out this dictator or let him live""... it's just two people trying to make sense of this crazy world that we live in.

The game lasts for about 10 minutes max, and despite what it says on the page, there is no sexual content or nudity of any kind in this game whatsoever. There are multiple endings, but absolutely nothing in the way of resolution. You're thrown in the middle of a story, and taken out before the ending of the story. You never learn anything about who your character is, or really learn anything of note about the girl.If you want to toss away three dollars on a 10 minute visual...no, visual novel is being too gracious. It's a 10 minute talking s scene, and that's all that it is. I'm sure there are probably people out there who theorize about the game and the ""meaning"" behind it, but it's essentially ""Hey can you put your pants on and leave? I have a hangover."""

Well written, fitting visuals, and the type of casual human mysteries that can be expected in just this type of situation.I can't say any dalliances I may have had played out ike this (why does the dude just lay in bed the whole time?), but this comes as close as it gets in a visual novel. The lady is clearly a fleshed-out character and it's a joy taking your first twenty minutes of free time trying to deduce who she is before jetting out the door.Heavily recommended."

I found myself really wondering who this girl is and what this whole thing was about. The only thing that I might consider disappointing is that the game feels so short to get from start to finish, but that does mean that it's easy to cycle through and try to get different endings, so I can't complain too much about that. It does give a sense of urgency when you realize you only had so much time to figure out what's going on, so you need to make every moment count. I like games that put this much work into story and creating an emotional response.Go ahead and give this one a shot if you like visual novels and want to enjoy a good, short story."

Story is simple, you wake up in a hangover next to a stranger and you need to choose what to do. One playthrough takes about 20 minutes, but there are 12 different endings and some dialogue choices, so it's nice to replay it. Every once in a while stranger leaves the room and you have the opportunity to search around her room and see if you can find something that could tell what happened. There are lot of things you can interact with, but you can only interact with some of them in one playthrough, so you need to choose carefully. Animations and music were also quite good. Voice acting would've been nice, but it's not a big deal. Overall, this is a good game for a cheap price."

It is very short, but for what it lacks in length it makes up for in choices and options within the game.I bought this game just this afternoon as a little time-waster. The price tag of £2.50 with a nice stack of possible achievements, along with the pretty unique plot (as far as Steam games go) made this a quick purchase. A stab in the dark perhaps, but a curious one at that.The art style is pretty nice- it's warm and dazy, it fits in really well with the overall tone and theme of the game. The character design of your new sleeping buddy is simplistic, but well represents the ""average woman in her early twenties"".I've played the game for around a total of 2 hours as of this review. I have completed several of the endings and have unlocked 52% of the achievements. Some people might find it tedious to repeat the story over and over to get all the endings/secrets, but hey, that's what the skip and save buttons are for. I personally am having fun trying the various options in different sequences to yield different results- deliberately looking out for new clues and word cues with each playthrough. And as someone who has never been in the position of the main character, it's pretty fun messing around and seeing what happens if you act like a total♥♥♥♥♥to the girl.I recommend this short game as a good time filler for anyone who likes getting achievements- certainly for the current price tag :)"

Good thing you will be playing a game to simulate this!StoryYou wake up with a huge headache, which soon becomes clear it is a hangover, in an unknown bedroom. What's worse? Waking up by a naked woman and having no idea who she is. Navigate through the situation to find out what happened the night before. Or to see where this one night stand can go for you. Will you run? Get kicked out? Or will something spark between the two of you?GameplayOne Night Stand plays like a classic visual novel game. Clicking to continue text, choose between a set of prompts you will say, and what you will investigate. You can change this in the options for it to go automatically or in later playthroughs skip over text you already saw. There is a base of text that will always happen, but as you choose different items or what to say new things will appear.The set up is basic, talk to the stranger and look around the room to examine items. Each time she leaves the less items you have time to look at. The items serve as a way to give the stranger depth to her, bringing it up might have her go in deoth but some things are too personal. While the other side is involved with peicing together what happened last night. Your actions determine the ending. Will you stay, be kicked out, or leave? Will you find out what happened? What is up with this stranger? The writing is very well written and realistic, not falling into the well common cringey or overly dramatic dialogue that is easyVisualsThe visuals seperate One Night Stand from most other visual novels. Bathed in a rich, soft colors and hand drawn visuals. Even adding in short animations to the stranger to give her more life. It is quite interesting, as it shows subtle movements the stranger does or give them movement by the moving outlines. Which also accompanies the objects as you hover over them to show you can look at them.SoundThe background music is simple featuring a guitar. Areas having a certain rhythm depending where you are with it silencing at the right moments. There are also other sound effects mostly going with the certain item, such as the shuffling of clothes, while the others are for talking and choosing the prompt. This can be a hit and miss depending on how you see the music and sound effects.ReplayabilityThe first playthrough usually can take 10-30 minutes depending on how fast you read or decide on your prompts. Showing what how you will deal with it first before going into ""what could of happened"". Going for all of the endings can easily go on for over an hour. And even than you might want to do things you haven't done to see all the possibilities that could of happened.Overall+ Animation+ Visuals+ Writing+ Story+/- Music/sound effects+/- Skip can be annoying at times (either being too slow or stopping sometimes)One Night Stand is a delightful visual novel that stands out from the rest. The one thing I see being a problem with players is that nothing is really revealed about the stranger even though all these clues telling otherwise. I do believe this goes with the theme, as you don't really get to know the person. You're not involved with the stranger other than the one night stand so she doesn't want to go into her past. She doesn't want to have a stranger find out everything about her to tell others. It's just an awkward mess that they are trying to survive from. Even though I personally haven't experienced a one night stand, it was interesting playing a game about it.With the price of the game and the well rounded gameplay, it is hard not to recommend One Night Stand."

,Recommended,549860,32960419,Posted: 28 June,all,PhineasPoe,"One Night Stand is a very short game. To get the full scope of it, you need to play it several times and that will, obviously, be repetitive. There is no voice-acting, so you'll have to read, which I know some people hate. Those are probably going to be the biggest turn-offs for some people, so I figured I would get them out of the way.What makes ONS great is how much it does with so little. Play-throughs go quickly, you're going to read the same dialogue a lot (there is a fast-forward option, though), it all takes place in one room with three screens and there's not a ton of objects to investigate. Still, the game builds this woman, who you know nothing about, into a real character. That's impressive. Most games can't manage to create a good, round character even with so much more time. There's nothing amazingly intriguing about her. She's normal, but you still want to know more. You still like her.The writing feels very natural, very real. It's an awkward situation and it's written like that. It doesn't try to be more than it is. It's not going to tug at your heartstrings. There's multiple endings, some of them are funny, some have you being a♥♥♥♥♥♥or weirding her out. I felt like most of them were worth going through the game multiple times to check out.The best thing about this game is the art and the animation of your mystery lady. The rotoscoping looks fantastic, but my favorite thing is how natural the character seems. It's my favorite thing and it's small stuff. The way she talks with her hands, little shrugs, she averts her eyes when things get awkward or plays with her hair. The way her mouth moves or the changes in her eyes.Every one involved in this project deserves tremendous praise. It's not for everybody. You need to be able to enjoy games that don't have a lot of gameplay, that are narrative based. And the repetition does get tiring. Still, it's an achievement to be able to get this much out of not a lot."

This game and every different play-through of it only makes sense if you have the same moral standards as the developer of the game. Through the comments of both characters and the name and description of the ... ""achievements"", it becomes quite clear what is ""right"" and ""wrong"". All of my 4 play-throughs felt weird. You have no real clue what will happen when you click on something, and the results can be quite different from what you are intending as the player.For example: At my fourth try, my character tried to get to know her better. You have to click on something in order for the game to progress. So I clicked on her teddy in order to have something to speak about. The teddy was directly placed on a shelf in plain sight. The reaction of her was like this: ""Whoa... you touched my stuff? Please... stay away from my teddy! Just leave!"" In the moment you are trying to state that you just are grabbing your stuff and will leave... she throws you out on the street - naked. Because you clicked her teddy. What? That just feels like the bad and old times of Point&Click, where any wrong click can kill you. And to top it off: You get a berating ""achievement"" for this.The developer breaks the fourth wall in a bad way: To tell you what is right and wrong."

One Night Stand by Kinmoku is about exactly that... one night of passion and what happens after.

You glance about her room trying to glean as much information as you can of the girl while trying to not make her feel uncomfortable by choosing the right words to say. We've all gone through that whether through an actual one night stand or even just the date itself. A simple, well-written story keeps it engaging yet familiar.

This grants this short game some replay aspects.I like how it conveys a feeling of uneasiness. It also tries to figure out what you thought by the items you examine.

You play as a young man who wakes up with a hangover in a stranger's bed and no memories. You're then tasked with examining the objects of her room for clues and small talk as she periodically engages you in conversation.The game makes for a good read that doesn't overstay its welcome, making it ideal for someone who wants to kill a little time or cleanse their gaming palate a little. That said, it does make it rather brief and anyone looking for more investment will find it lacking in content. People looking for 100% completion, or to experience all the story, will also probably find certain segments repetitive after going through them so many times.Ultimately it's worth the asking price, if only for the art style.

You awake next to a naked stranger in her bedroom, with a terrible hangover and no memory of the past night. You'll have various short conversations with the girl, while both of you try to figure out how to deal with the situation. Occasionally she leaves the room, which gives you an opportunity to look around and discover things to talk about.Characters and dialogue are realistic and believable, and the game handles its subject matter in a sensitive, mature way that felt refreshingly different from many other visual novels I've looked into. The game also does an excellent job in remembering even small details of your decisions, and having them affect the following parts of the conversation. Your choices really do matter a lot, and the game features 12 substantially different endings.The game's graphics consist of simple, slightly animated drawings in mellow colors. I found that a very welcome change from the anime aesthetics of most visual novels. The soft visuals and the soothing music combine to a very pleasant aesthetic that turns the game into a particularly relaxing experience.One Night Stand is a fairly short game - it is, in an interesting case of poetic justice, a game that can easily be experienced in a single night, with all its facets and all different endings. The shortness makes it easy and less tedious to hunt for endings one may have missed so far. The game's price reflects its shortness appropriately.I wish there were more visual novels with the courage to break the narrative and artistic conventions that most games in the genre seem to adhere to. One Night Stand does this in several ways, and ends up being original, refreshing, and memorable."

76561198096562593,Recommended,549860,26666467,"Posted: 17 November, 2016",all,Sestuss,"It’s worth the price and is certainly a fun short little experience on a subject that hasn't really been explored with this level of sincerity elsewhere.This game has a nice art style and basic story. I think as the main theme goes, it very much achieves immersion in this real life circumstance. But as far as other endings go there isn't quite enough here. It’s as if it the game designer felt as if there needed to be all these multiple endings, hinting at other paths with exciting dramatic consequences that ultimately are only wrong turns. Some things are simply a distraction and searching for the other paths feel ultimately frustrating and fruitless.There is clearly a main story that works really well, and it is fascinating to learn about characters and their seemingly real lives. But there are clues here that lead you to believe there is a big secret that really distract from a amazingly grounded narrative. And as a minor note it feels like a pain to try and go for the other endings because there are so few choices and the choices you do have are obscurely connected to their subsequent outcomes. What I mean here is that there is a lot of boring trial and error before you figure out where else you can go.I think the other endings firstly should only add to the grounded story of two people akwardly making their way through this. And I should say much of this was likely intentional, a sort of play on people's expectations of games with multiple endings. As you can see the only real frustration I had with this game is the other endings. I just wish I had more time with these characters rather than shooting for figuring out how to activate the achievements. Play it a few times with a few ideas in mind but only delve into everything else if you really want to.Other than that check it out, we should explore more small moments in people's lives and encourage game designers to do so."

76561198048212729,Recommended,549860,29731414,Posted: 5 February,all,true_color222,One night stand is a charming little adventure that puts you in the shoes of a man suffering alchohol induced memory loss who happens to wake up in the home of a mysterious girl. The game in its entirety seems remarkably fresh and though it may be short does offer a number of possible endings that allows for moderate replayability. In the end  I can't help but feel like I'm wanting more and that there is so much more potentail here. The art style is deffinitly ambitious and is pulled off quite well for a title like this. Though this is clearly intended to be a very short story as the title suggests a sequal would deffinitly hold alot of value. Deffinitly worth the price 8/10 would play again.
,Recommended,549860,29857214,Posted: 11 February,all,windar2000,"""One Night Stand"" is far from being as good as it could be, but it's a noble attempt to make a more mature and adult simulation of human interaction than we often see. This is not a game about trying to hook up with someone. It's not some ""Leisure Suit Larry"" kind of deal where your endgame goal is to see this girl take her top off or something. Instead, ""One Night Stand"" is about exploring the different possibilities of what can happen during a strange and awkward situation, a situation many people will find achingly identifiable.This game is perfect for those who emotionally invest themselves in virtual interactions. If you love forming relationships in games like ""Mass Effect"" or ""Dragon Age,"" you will likely find something to love about ""One Night Stand."" Though very brief, this game is insanely re-playable for those who are tortured by ""what if"" questions. ""What if I said this?"" or ""What if I did that?"" People who find that kind of exploration satisfying will get the most out of ""One Night Stand.""The biggest drawback is that ""One Night Stand"" forces its own sense of morality a little too much. You are literally punished in the story for doing things the game itself makes you feel like you have to do. The young woman you are interacting with also forms negative opinions of you based off of things she has no way of even knowing that you did. This is a frustrating thing to learn through multiple playthroughs. It would have been far more interesting if the game was less concerned with judging your moral decisions, and even less so concerned with punishing those decisions.A worthwhile play overall, though I sincerely hope another game improves on the ideas that ""One Night Stand"" presents."

If it actually happened to you, it would be a story you told your friends once at most.However, because it's a video game, the experience is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.This game surprised me so much. It's so engaging despite having almost no climax; it's a choice based text game that demands you replay it more than once. Surprising for a story based text/point and click game, it seems more suited for completionists than anything. Finishing this game once will take you 15 minutes at most, but that's not the intention at all. You're meant to replay the same scenario at least a dozen of times, seeing what will change and how you can make the girl like you or hate you.From reading this review you will see that the premise of this game is terrible, but the execution is so unique and incredible that there is simply nothing else like it. Comparing the 15 minutes finishing time I mentioned earlier to my play time, you will get an idea of the kid of experience this piece of gaming art offers."

Now go and wriggle your way out of this!You can interact with your environment in some small way - depending on what items you choose to interact with you get different dialogue choices, both your words and actions will determine whether the girl you hooked up with will curse the day she met you or actually feel ok about (or look forward to) meeting you again.While one playthrough is pretty short, the game is quite clearly intended to be played several times, and I thought it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. If you've ever been in a situation like that before, it'll probably make you chuckle here and there, if you haven't - well, you might as well get a bit of practise here (esp considering some of the endings aren't entirely pleasant). So, definitely redommended.Btw, I unlocked the ""best ending"" last and actually struggled a bit with getting there... which is both quite fitting and quite hilarious in hindsight (just play the game, and you'll probably understand why)."

It portrays a lot of the emotions or thoughts that one goes through in realtionships, and at least from the girl's point of view, does it with a slightly depressed sort of sweetness. Despite the light colorations, it was a moody, almost dark thing to me. Not in a negative way. Again, it was sweet, depending on what courses of action the male chose. I was not a fan of the swirly rotoscope type of thing done with the girl, but have to say that it really didn't detract that much.Interesting that if you (as the guy) were trying to be on the up & up, nice or whatever term fits, that is, to be considerate of the girl's feelings, it could sometimes backfire slightly. I believe that just shows how different a lot of us are and think/feel. I always wonder, in this kind of visual/virtual novel, why the author(s) chose this or that particular path or action to head towards a particular branch of the story. Most of the time, I find that I don't agree with their triggers, but, again, we are all different. In any case, I found it worthwhile. If you're trying to be a man, and not a conquistador, it was a (sorry to use this word again) semi-sad sweet experience."
