76561198086542708,Recommended,549910,26427161,"Posted: 4 November, 2016",all,UnimaginativeHandle,"This is another 'I wish there was a sideways thumb' games.This has a good atmosphere, it's a 'this is too dark' game but they give you a Gamma slider so it isn't a deal breaker.Sound is well crafted for the most part, doors seem to all have a 'jiggling the door handle' sound effect regardless of whether it has a door handle or not; but that is a minor annoyance.The gameplay is hit and miss, you read emails on computer terminals & get directed by a mysterious person texting you & these will direct you to computer passwords, keycodes or items you need to open doors while you gradual uncover spooky evidence about corporations meddling with forces they can't even comprehend & surprise something goes wrong & a fog tries to kill you. Nothing most office workers haven't experience, but it is handled well enough here.When the black fog will chase you, you have to do very trial & error maze running through an office building which to it's credit actually has variety in its corridors, so the problem isn't that it all looks the same, but it feels like the fog is too close, so if you make a wrong turn then you get sucked in & killed & have to do the section over again. It feels like a minor balance issue, because the map is well designed, rather than the annoying same corridor labyrinth trash we've all seen on Steam before.These sections aren't long but they are long enough that you could get killed 5 times before getting the path right.That's the only major downfall, it can get frustrating repeating the same section a bunch of times trying to find the right way.I'm recommending but it's a cautious one; 'you are locked in a office building' games have been a bit of a gamble as a genre, but this one is better than most unless trial & error really annoys you quickly."
,Recommended,549910,26444869,"Posted: 5 November, 2016",all,CjuGames,"There are some pretty frustrating aspects to be found in this game, but for the price it's a solid purchase for a horror enthusiast. It will probably take you 1-2 hours to fully complete.Following instructions from a phone found in your office, you'll explore the building looking for a way to escape a strange force that seems to be following you. In doing so, you'll check computers, find items, hide under desks, climb through vents and anything else you can do to solve some basic environmental puzzles and survive. The game offers little in the way of handholding (outside of the messages on your phone), so you'll need to use your own initiative and imagination to get out of some of the bad situations you'll be faced with.The game uses the unreal engine fairly well creating a nice looking, detailed office environment to explore. FPS performance and loading times were great throughout my own experience. My only real complaint as far as this goes is that I think the game is far too dark in some areas. If there are no nearby light sources you'll be staring at a completely black screen quite often. I recommend sliding the gamma right up.The audio leaves a little to be desired as you'll be treated to a range of sounds from your surroundings and... Whatever the hell is following you, but I couldn't help wanting a little more to increase my immersion and terror. It's currently quite basic, but it works.Story-wise, you'll have to check nearby computer terminals and check on your colleagues e-mail to piece the story together. It's fairly interesting, but I have to say I was a little disappointed with the conclusion.There are currently a few bugs and glitches to be found within the game, but no more than you would expect to see from an indie game with a small team behind it. Nothing game-breaking to worry about.Overall I would say it's worth a go if you're a horror fan. If you're not, then I would suggest looking elsewhere. It's nothing that new and it won't blow your mind, but it's not a bad way to spend an hour or two.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLDfsRGYiu8"

I like the idea of being 'chased' for horror games and it works well enough here.Obviously don't go in expecting a AAA title nor one that is going to last you a long, long time, but it's certainly worth the price it's at right now."

(I just noticed that i'm literally shaking while i'm writing)The whole scare is based on not knowing. Not knowing where to go, what to do. You will eventually figure it out by trial and error.I'm not sure if there was an attempt to make some sort of tutorial (Wasn't really useful, i figured out most of the things well ahead), BUT i don't think this game needs a tutorial, because it's after all based on not knowing. It added to the experience having to figure out the controls myself.The sounds of pushing and knocikng chairs are really confusing.The pita of this game is, well, laggy (not smooth even on max settings) camera. Also, why does only 1 out of 8 stalls include toilet paper? :DI really enjoyed plaing this game. Four euros well spent."
,Recommended,549910,28419703,"Posted: 16 December, 2016",all,Boregasmic Gaming,"Locked Fears is overall a great game. Being chased by something sinister and mysterious has always been a big factor for games IMO. Game 8/10 Graphics is 10/10 Audio is 7/10, meaning it is desynced at some points and I noticed a lot of 'dead' parts when it came to the audio.Also, dealing with the 'smoke monster' is quite a challenge. It sometimes camps on the areas you need to go. The game also does not give enough clues to help the players. A huge trial and error.Here's my take on Locked Fears on YouTube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-blLngJDNOw"
,Not Recommended,549910,30015144,Posted: 18 February,all,Biohazard2191,"Absolute waste of even $2. Of course the game looks great graphically, how do you expect to be reeled in these days? But gameplay-wise, talk about lag and stutter. Along with the fact that the game itself just seems to darken immediately to the point where you are in fact just running around blind. I saw both sides to the reviews and still figured ""why not give it a go for a lets play"". More like Lets play something else."

,Not Recommended,549910,28255646,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,Mister_Bucket,"I read some good reviews of this, and was interested in a short, scary game for the evening. The price was about that of a movie rental, so I was all aboard. I will say, I have no problem with the $4 I spent, but I do have a problem with the 2.2 hours I spent. The game goes nowhere. There's no resolution. You get a vague text message on the Macguffin phone and then you're back at the title screen. You obviously do some things in order to get that far, but there's no real reason related to the horror to be doing it. There's one sequence where the game insta-kills you for making wrong turns (you have to basically Edge of Tomorrow your way through) that was so frustrating that I had to quit the game for a while. It just took me out of the entire horror of it, and rather made it just annoying. There were moments of brilliance, and I can see that the developer has some talent, so I will not be asking for a refund, I just have to say I'd rather not have spent my time on it."
76561198268407347,Not Recommended,549910,26528439,"Posted: 10 November, 2016",all,ITORIFFIC,"Trial and Error Gameplay + Insta-Kill Enemy + Poor Checkpoint System = Massive Fustration.Amazingly enough, this game IS pretty scary. But for the wrong reasons. The enemy, a black cloud, is admittedly terrifying. However, it becomes more annoying then scary as the game goes on. Especially when youre trying to reset computers. It took me 3 or 4 tries to get by that part (insta-kills you if you touch it and PURPOSELY hangs out nearby you ALL THE TIME)When I entered the vent in the very next area, I INSTANTLY DIED FOR NO REASON, and spawned back at THE BEGINNING OF THE LEVEL, I was done. Oh, and another thing about this Server Room part... I played it about 10 times and only beat it twice. The first time I died in the vent for no reason... The second time I missed a jump and fell behind the computer drives that form a bridge for you to cross.. THERE IS NO WAY OUT OF THAT AREA. You cannot make the jump, or go under, or anything. Glitch. My. ♥♥♥♥ing. God.*sigh*This is not a terrible game.. And it has A LOT of promise. It looks real good, has a great pricetag, and is admittedly very scary (if a bit overly dark).. but I can't reccomend it for it's overly fustrating moments, and lack of checkpoints that cover obviously challenging areas."

The atmosphere however is amazing, very dark and scary - you'll hear noises all around you and have things thrown at you randomly. I don't know if this is a jumpscare game yet or what to really expect but I look forward to it. Not sure how long this game is either but for the price, it is definitely worth it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhffeOOxu_o"

,Not Recommended,549910,26513300,"Posted: 9 November, 2016",all,DeadGavin,"Gee where do I begin?So I booted up this game and noticed there was no audio option... Which was an issue since I was on skype... So right off the bat I was a little dissapointed. Then once I started the game I noticed that the game was darker than the inside of a cow, and the brightness option in the game did nothing to fix that.The phone prompted me to get out of the building, so I started to run. Almost completely blind I moved towards what I believed was an exit, and I left clicked... The game tabbed me out because it didn't have a mouse lock... I soon after die to god knows what...After going to my computer settings and turning up the brightness to almost god level I tried to suffer through the game anyway. The next objective that I had an issue in was soon after that. It told me to put the memory chip of one computer into another one, but the first memory chip was hidden in ""The second water tank in the restroom."" I went in there to look for it, and I broke all of the water tanks *Instead of just opening them... Because ♥♥♥♥ it?* I didn't see the envelope in any of the tanks... After walking back and forth aimlessly for a while I went back into there and just spam clicked e on every tank. I found it... I guess when this guy Mark put a memory card in the second tank in the restroom he also meant he was going to put it in the girls room....On a plus note from what I could see the game looks almost good if it was brighter... Except for the monster thing... Which looked like a dark cloud and when it killed you your screen was just surrounded in the dark cloud and you died.... Oh and the monster thing glitched out a bit... It attached part of its cloud to a chair and was in the light completely and looked kind of funny.Overall... This game was poorly done and I am going to take advantage of the steam refund system."

,Recommended,549910,29416945,Posted: 22 January,all,!_Deus Vult _!,"Not bad at all for a $1 price. In fact, some of its rooms and environments are real creepy and the developer, who turns out to be a single individual has done a really good job in NOT revealing the identity of those mysterious entities for quite a long time. I'm 1.9 hours already and I do not know what really is going on in the office building, unlike a lot of other horror simulators that reveal the bad things pretty swiftly.And considering that this been made by a single individual, he's done a marvellous job in achieving picture quality visuals thanks to UE4. I see there's a lot of hard effort put on this little gem, and I'll give a 9/10, although the developer could add in some more mysterious entities if its possible? Rest assured, some of those rooms are really dark and dangerous. Somewhat reminded me of Outlast's closed corridors where you have no option other than hearing the heart beat and pray that that 'thing' wouldn't spot you beneath the desk!"
