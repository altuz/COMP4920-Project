,Recommended,550010,29280486,Posted: 15 January,all,MagicMan1068,"I play this game on the weekends, when I'm at work, and I absolutely love this game.  Happy Room allows you to create your own deathtraps, and see how they work out.  The fun, and sometimes annoying, thing is the different dummies react differently.  For example, I'll set a bouncer to fling the dummy toward the wall and then get blasted by a death ray, and maybe have him land on a spike trap... On a test run, I'll see where one dummy lands, but following dummies land in different areas.  So, you really have to work at destroying these dummies.The only thing that I would say that they could do, to REALLY make this game above and beyond, I wish you could edit the dummies.  If there was a mode, or something, that allowed you to edit the dummies to look like other people that would put this game over the top.  I'm sure I'm not the only one... There's other people out there that has just had a bad day, and you edit the dummy to look like someone that rubbed you the wrong way, and then blow them to hell and back... It turns your day around.I highly recommend this title.  It's cheap, it's insanely fun and addictive, and I would only add that one small feature.  Other than that, GREAT GAME!!!"

I think the only thing i want right now is for sandbox to be unlockable from the start as right now, it feels repetitive just to get access to sandbox. It has a very nice gameplay but has been brought down by the repetitive gameplay. I am hoping this will be improved and the community will grow. Want to find out what I think of this game?Audio - The audio is pretty funny to be honest. It sounds nice and joyful although you are torturing someone to death. To me, that sounds nice :)"

I was playing, i had almost killed the dummy, when the game removed all my progress. I had a good room saved, so I used that and returned to where I was, but I can't earn upgrade points or upgrade anything, or do missions. Wait until the game is fixed before buying.Update, with spoilers: This game still has numerous bugs in it, such as sometimes not allowing me to do missions at all, or loading up without any of my unlocks (but I can still place any weapons because... why?). Basically, I still say that you should wait a few updates before buying, but if you are OK with a number of bugs then you probably will still enjoy it."

I already got 30/37 steam achievements, which means i did several different kinds of ality already..You guys just told me I have to do all these again! It feels like i`ve been punked....and something about the 1.0.4patch, I can not change the language in game after update to 1.0.4.  I played chinese edition from start...but chinese translation SUCKS... In order to get the right idea, I had to change the language between chinese and english from time to time. this ran well until v1.0.4 came up..now I am stuck in chinese language, stuck in bad translations.....hope you guys keep working... and still this is a very good game. I can`t wait to see it become great..."

That the was semi realistic gravity. so i got my saws and i put them in a angle pointing down and i put a portal on the end of the sloped ""conveor"" and i put the blue portal on the top of the convauer so when i made a steep slope i made basicly a hack were the cycle continues even when the saws run out the gravity and the portal pulling the body towards it made it possible to make a endless loop. I stopped about at the Acid when i just decided to make this kown and fixed because it may let you have all the weapons in the game but after that, what do you do? I know like you test out everything and stuff like that but after all the adventure is taken out.SO please update the game and make it so that cant be done.MAybe make it so the portal pull is only when the body is 50% or more into the portal. and make so thta the portal doesnt shoot out the body."

,Not Recommended,550010,29248816,Posted: 14 January,all,Stuffington,"Happy Room - Ragdoll Slaughterhouse Simulator 2016I have a complicated relationship with this game.On one hand, it is a fairly enjoyable ragdoll sim, with unlockable weapons to murderize the ragdoll with. And for a ragdoll sim, it's pretty well put together. The physics feel pretty good, the weight of the doll and the power of the weapons match really well. Unlockable and upgradable weapons are a nice addition, and although I didn't really enjoy the sandbox mode or the ""open world"" style room, I get the appeal.On the other hand, however, the game is severely flawed for a person like me, who strives to complete games 100%. This is due to a couple of things; first a weapon which you unlock early on;The Ice Gun(spoiler i guess?), and second, the missions - more on that later!The Ice Guntrivializes the game, as it is a fast and surefire way to destroy the doll. Just fill the room with these bad boys and watch as your doll gets destroyed in a matter of seconds. This is where the problems come in; The blank-ality based achievements. These achievements require you to kill the ragdoll with each weapon. This means that the final blow has to be dealt by every weapon in the game at least once. And since the aformentioned weapon isthefastest way to damage the doll, you want at least a couple of these in your room when farming these achievements. However, due to their high damage and very fast firerate, there is no way to ensure that they don't steal the kill for themselves, giving you their fatality. Over and over. This in turn leads to a couple of hours of frustrating, trial-and-error room building, to make sure that you get every fatality available.When I first played the game, I noticed that the majority of the achievements were based on these weapon-specific fatalities, and I decided to knock these of the list first. That was a mistake. Whilst progressing through the game - beating all 120 of the in-game missions - I noticed something. Around the 100th mission, I had been tasked with killing the dummy with a specific weapon. After I had done that, I was once again tasked with killing the dummy with a new weapon. Yup. To get the achievement for completing all missions, you have to go through every. Single. Weapon, killing the dummy with it and getting that weapons fatality. Having already done that turned the game into a horrible, time-consuming repeat of itself. I had to do everything again, which was only made worse at the thought that it could all have been avoided had i only known that these tasks would be some of the last in the game. My playtime could have been effectively cut in half had I not made the mistake of prematurely completing the weapon kills. This could be avoided altogether if the mission system was updated, so that it rather than giving you 4 tasks at a time, gave you the option to complete the missions in any order.This frustrating and time-wasting experience of practically redoing everything the game has to offer is what has prompted me tonot recommendHappy Room."

A little short and the challenges could be a little more difficult (or have more), but overall really enjoyable for the $5 price tag. The sandbox mode is a little buggy. I am trying to see if I can max out the damage bar in sandbox, but too many weapons cause framerate issues and the dummy freezes midair or sometimes leaves the play area altogether. If you like ragdoll games and just want some fun and waste a little time, pick this up."

The music is fun and the controls are simple. Great for killing time or for when you only have a little time to play."
