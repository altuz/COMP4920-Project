But after solving the first puzzle things got clear.I was missing my 2560x1440 resolution in the options menu.So i launched this Unity game with the Steam launch options:""-fullscreen -screen-width 2560 -screen-height 1440""."

The game has great atmospheric music and the jump scares are on point. They got me quite a few times. The puzzles can be pretty hard if you do not think about it and explore your surroundings. I Played the game twice, first time took me about 2 Hours and the second time through beat it just under an hour.overall i would give EastFog Props on what they made, Thumbs up!I made a first impressions, gameplay video of this game if you want to check it out:https://youtu.be/0f_9y3AhcSQ"

Play it on midnight in one go for the best experience :P"
76561197997678124,Recommended,550310,34220377,Posted: 13 August,all,fragkitten,"This is a neat little game, albeit short. I recommend this on sale.It has a solidly spooky atmostphere. I didn't find myself to be really scared at all and kinda laughed every time the 'ghost' would show up. The puzzles ranged from obvious to really tough. I needed to watch a walkthrough to solve 3 of them.The graphics and sound are good. Voice acting and music are good as well. I really enjoyed the story. For a one person job, I think that the effort was stellar. I also really appreciate having achievements to chase after.There is a LOT of backtracking so I wish that I was able to run. I also feel like the spelling and grammar could use a bit more polish. I was able to understand what was being said, so it wasn't undecipherable. Just has a bit of room for improvemnent. I would have also liked to play on a higher resolution.That's all I have to say. Thanks and good job to the Dev! I look forward to seeing more games from you."
,Recommended,550310,32846604,Posted: 27 June,all,Shakan,Really enjoy this game. use headphones though for the full jump scare experience.Only thing is every time you open the game the symbols reset and you need to rediscover them but it does not effect the game play. Would love more games like this just a bit longer also. <3
,Recommended,550310,34073992,Posted: 6 August,all,mmustric,"To the developer: Improvements have higher resolution selections like 1920 x 1200 or higher added in. Please make the walk speed slightly faster. There was one instance where dragging the pick into the can of beans (which was the incorrect match), that caused the pick to stay in the center of the screen. It went away when I used the pick in the correct place on the lock in the kitchen. Save state did work to a degree (I tested it once) but I had to redo a few things. I noticed the save state didn’t load showing the electric box open after completing that before, although that didn’t affect game play. Upon loading from a save, it didn’t keep my mouse inversion saved. Not bad for a single person coding this. Needs a little more clean up. Voice acting should be redone completely though with a different voices in my opinion. Anyway keep up the progress in making it better."

The atmosphere and music was so eerie and many times I was hesitant to venture on but I took a  deep breath and continued. Nice puzzles, good graphics, good story line. I found this more scary than the Amnesia games, perhaps because this was a real life type game, no strange monsters chasing you, etc. I am ready to play  the next game this developer makes. My opninion, ""Good Job""!"

Nice creepy atmosphere, several good jump scares, varied puzzles, not a bad story, & the voice acting was much appreciated.  There were a number of grammatical errors but none severe enough to be off-putting.  The only major NOPE were those big, fat, juicy spiders - ugh!  Great way to spend a couple of hours."

I have to play in spurts because it gets to me. If you like PT style or Layers of Fear I would pick this up.Update: The ending has meaning. NO SPOILERS. There is a message built in to this game about humanity for sure. The translations are a tad off, but it's okay because it doesn't affect the game. It goes from creepy, to creepier, to ""ah, I see"".I was scared, nervous, and satisifed with the ending."

The creator did a great job of pulling the player into the game, which is something a lot of horror games fail to do. The puzzles are clever and satisfying to solve and don't rely on cheap clues like conveniently placed notes with the code written on it. The only downside is the translation isn't great, but considering the game was made by only one person I can forgive that."
,Not Recommended,550310,35120217,Posted: 21 September,all,Annabel Lee,"I respect the honesty in the fact that the developer stated explicitly in the intro that only one person worked on this game, there may be errors in it and was open to suggestions to make future projects better. I enjoy indie games and I love the idea of helping to support new or upcoming artists and creators. Having said that, I was incredibly disappointed in this game. I also don't recall seeing that information prefaced on the game's product page. If I missed it, my bad. If I didn't, please put this on there. It does not bode well. People should be aware of what they're buying.First, the game glitched out on me, freezing everything upon just opening it.. twice. Second, I unlocked 17% of my achievements for the game without doing anything at all, just pacing back and forth for 20 minutes looking for clues. Literally, I did nothing here. There are no control settings; typically every game I've played so far has this. The English translation for the captions are not like the ones in the trailer; I understood them but they simply look to have been translated incorrectly. I couldn't go upstairs nor go into any of the rooms/doors on the 1st floor, not even the one I came from! Lolwut?!I love atmospheric, dark games and including puzzles in it.. sounded too good to be true. Unfortunately, in this case it is."
76561198018619161,Recommended,550310,34851170,Posted: 9 September,all,Under Dog,"This is a very good game. The puzzles were fairly easy. The story was good. I liked the way something in the house changed or the situations changed when you figured something out. If I'm to give anything a bad word, it would be that around half way through the game, everything is foggy and blurry until you get right up to it. maybe you meant it to be that way. maybe your character is getting tired. I don't know. It was also a funny music puzzle. Mary had a little lamb. Really? LOL. for a couple of dollars and 3.1 hours, it was fun and worth it to me. oh yeah, the achievements are extremely easy to get. you just have to keep your eyes open and look around."

76561198007747398,Recommended,550310,31659297,Posted: 9 May,all,𝒮ℴ𝓅𝒽𝒾𝒶.ℐ.𝒥,"Root of Evil: the tailor is one of the best indie horror games Ive seen so far. It's fairly short,but successfully delivered a creepy atmosphere, a few pant-wetting jumpscares , average puzzles and a decent story plot. The pressure of the horror slowly builds up in you and just when you think you're safe, BOOM ! I sense a eastern asian style of horror, which is, in my opinion, the best kind of psychological horror there is.There are a few things to improve though. The game needs to be more optimized cuz it's pretty laggy sometimes. English content needs proofreading also. Chinese content is okay but could have been better. Voice acting lacks emotions and expressiveness. and It might not be a good idea to actually EXPLAIN the game's message at the end, better to use more metaphors and hints throughout the game.That being said, I still think it's really damn impressive to make a game like this single-handedly. I'd give it 3.5/5. Please make more."

,Recommended,550310,34822482,Posted: 8 September,all,Slim Shady,I really liked the plot twist at the end. It was made by one person and it's really good for an indie horror game with only one person behind it.
,Recommended,550310,34793650,Posted: 7 September,all,markzwaan,"This is the first project from a one person development team. Creating a coherent, bugfree game isn't easy so just because of that I'm giving this game an A for effort. The house looks pretty good overall, not AAA quality, but I've definitely seen much, much worse. The puzzles are good, ranging from easy and predictable to clever and original. The atmospere is appropriately creepy with some well timed jump scares. And there's a creepy story that is told through cutscenes (so no endless reading of notes, scraps of paper and diary entries) with decent voice overs.But there are also a bunch of problems with this game.First of all it's unclear where and when the game is set. Most clues seem to point at turn of the century England (around 1900), with the investigation taking place about 20 years later, so around 1920. But there are many items in the game from later time periods. There are cardboard boxes in the hallway and kitchen with the date 15-5-2007 stamped on them. On a chalk board displaying a calender the word ""yoga"" is mentioned. Yoga was invented in America in the 1960's and didn't exist before that, certainly not around 1900. In the living room a 1960's style television is seen (and used for a puzzle that is inspired by the lcd styled numbers like the ones you see on an electronic calculator). A 1950's style telephone is also found in the living room and I could go on. I could have lived with one or two minor mistakes, but the more attention I started paying, the more anachronistic elements I discovered.While the puzzles work well and some are rather clever, they aren't well integrated into the story. There is no (contextual) explanation given why there are so many puzzles strewn about this house. Some of the more traditional point-and-click style puzzles work well, but the others break any immersion of being in an actual haunted house.The story is creepy and I like the fact that it is told through flash backs rather than through a series of diary entries. But the mental state of one of the characters makes no sense. First she is presented as being psychotic, but later she mentiones that she no longer has short term memory (like the main character in Memento). Which is a completely different kind of mental illness, often caused by the brain being damaged after an accident and not something that is the logical conclusion of being psychotic. At the end of the game the developer mentions that he/she was trying to convey some ancient bhudist wisdom. Without going into detail I can only say that what is seen in the story doesn't match at all with what the developer was trying to convey. Which is a pity because I admire that he/she was trying to do more than just tell a creepy story.As many reviewers have pointed out the English seen in the game is badly translated, which seems to be a returning problem for a lot of non-western based indie developers.You're given journal early on. This is usualy used to give subtle hints on what to do next and to summarize the story so far. Not is this game. Three entries is all you'll get and they're kind of pointless.My last annoyance is the fact that the main character is called a telepath, psychic and exorcist. He never shows any signs of being telepathic (being able to read minds or project thoughts in other minds) or of being an exorcist. Calling him a psychic detective would fit the bill with what we see him do. But telepath and exorcist?In conclusion I'd like to give this advice to the developer:- Do some research about the geographic location and period of time you set your games in. Find pictures, paintings, examples of news papers and magazines of the appropriate period and location and use this to determine how the game should look- Try and blend the puzzles into the environment or give a good reason for the obviously gamey puzzles to be in the game (like in the 7th Guest)- Find someone to proofread and correct all texts, preferably someone who speaks the language natively and if possible uses it professionally (f.i. someone who writes, translates or teaches a language for a living)- If you use a mental illness as a central part of the plot, again do some research, find out how it would effect someone and use this to advance the story- Similarly if you have a message that you want to convey that is based around some key ideas, look up the defintion of these words and make sure that the characters representing these ideas behave appropriately and that their motivations are clearly convoyed to the player"
