,Recommended,550360,26402510,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,SweViver,"The game ""One Of The Last"" was released today, and even if its still an early access title, I think this is a very nice looking VR zombie shooter. You are able to move freely by teleporting around the backstreets, kill different kind of zombies and creatures, collect items and special power-ups like ""Instant kill"" for example.Here is some gameplay video from today:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKrSKprF_swThe environment and surroundings in One Of The Last reminds me a lot about the game Call of Duty Black Ops Zombies, which actually isnt something bad! The graphics are very nice and quite detailed, the weapon handling works fine even thou the sword is way too overpowered compared to the pistol. The game runs 100% smooth on my system and Im glad that I did this purchase as I find lots of value in those 13 bucks spent on this game.Personally, I think this game is much better than most other available wave-shooting games in VR, even thou you still play waves/rounds one after another. I guess the teleporting movement system adds a lot to this wave-genre after all! Sorry for the crash at the end of this video, I guess my PC was overloaded by both playing One Of The Last as well as recording this video, so I wont blame the game for this.I will update this review as soon as I play some more, but for now i definately recomment it to everyone!"

(I have a pretty meaty machine)Sounds: There's NO joy from shooting the weapons.. super puny sound assets, these should be upgraded asap.Holster mechanic: I couldn't holster the machine guns etc, but i dont know if it should be possible.I got stuck at the big blue 'rock' thing in the open square and quit after round 10 because i couldn't figure out what to do.At round 10 i had ~20K $ and needed something more to happen.. perhaps if i could get past the blue thing.I can't really recommend it now until i see more progress.I will revise my review after next update."

Having played COD zombies and other VR titles like Brookhaven, it may evolve to be a lot of fun especially with a multiplayer component.Had a little difficulty with picking up/dropping items, and the movement (teleportation) is a bit slow.  I see movement being sped up in later releases.  Being able to move around is a nice feature and of course the weapons and exploration are fun aspects of the game.  A couple things I dislike in the zombie VR titles is constant darkness and light management.  Maybe in horror games, but this is really about busting zombies.Surely some new colors of flannel shirts and other looks are in order and a more tactile feel to the weapons and combat will make the experience even better.Kudos to the developers - I think they are off to a great start."

Guns are kind of generic right now but I believe new guns, or at least gun upgrades, are in the games EA roadmap. Overall, I've been having a lot of fun with my roommate! As of this review, you get one large map with a good varitey of guns and perks to claim and one smaller map for a more fast paced experience.  The mechanics are very classic arcade style mechanics with no manual reloading or two handed weapon handeling but I hear there could be plans to revisit this.  Traditional movement, which is my prefered method, is supported as well as the motion sick proof teleportation system, so YAY FOR OPTIONS! You'll be helping the dev fine tune the game for a little while being that it's EA but It's currently got a lot of replay value as is so yea, get it!  With a bit more polish and bug fixes it will be one I revisit every day."

,Recommended,550360,29002944,Posted: 4 January,all,KEEVS,Very fun. Play exactly like CoD Zombies but in VR as the description implies. Has a lot of potential cannot wait to see more maps more area to explore and harder faster zombies and maybe a boss.Keep up the good work!

I literally couldn't go on top of side  walk edges and kept glitching out  wherever  there was even a slight  change in floor elevation. Hopefully this  all gets sorted  out. Nonetheless, well worth the price."

Please give feedback to help them out. the map layout is pretty good, they are working on the Z's being better at attacking also. They definately have taken the idea of COD zombies."

Large, Progressive, unlockable maps give this game some freedom and exploration witch adds a good amount of depth.   The Multi-Player really adds a good dynamic to the game.Good value for the content.  Developers are also active in the community."

,Recommended,550360,31150054,Posted: 14 April,all,Gundaim,"If you have any interest in CoD zombies, this game is definitely worth a buy.  If you are looking for a coop game to play with friends it is definitely worth buying.  Currently the player base is small so it is hard to find a coop game if you dont know people, unfortunately but that can only be fixed by more people buying the game.The game is a little rough around the edges right now, but at its core it is really good.  Some of the assets could use a little work, a little more realistic sound for the guns, and there are a few bugs, but it is early access.  The important thing is that the core gamplay and concept is very solid.  Once these things are ironed out this will be a really good game, and I have high hopes for that happening based on how interactive the devs have been since I have owned it.When I first bought the game, I had a game breaking bug where i was unable to pick up any weapons.  I didnt see anything about it when looked on the forums, so I posted about it.  The devs responded the next day, and put out a patch in an attempt to fix it, but it didnt work.  The devs then started working with me to get more info, and after talking back and forth over a few days, they were able to figure out what my obscure problem was and implemented another fix, and I was able to play!"
,Not Recommended,550360,30643146,Posted: 20 March,all,Corrosion,Decent but I encountered several bugs in my short time of playing. I'm going to play more to get my money's worth.
,Recommended,550360,29521464,Posted: 27 January,all,Pirdy,"This game really does feel like a VR version of COD Zombie mode. For being early access I didn't run into any significant bugs. Due to the limited player base of VR and how new this game is, it doesn't look like multiplayer will be easy to do at this point. I don't think it will be an issue by the time this game is fully released.I also found the game a little too easy at this stage. However, that may be in part due to how much I played COD zombie mode. I survived for ~20 rounds before dying due to setting my controllers down to open a drink. I would give this game a 8/10 at this point. The only reason it isn't 10/10 is due to how hard it is to get a multiplayer game going. That will only be fixed with more people playing, so buy the game and get all your friends to buy the game.Side Note: The corner by the shotgun spawn is a perfect place to setup a BBQ and lawn chair while dispatching the undead hoards."
76561197970377377,Recommended,550360,30263846,Posted: 1 March,all,Jon Dadley,"One Of The Last is a great shooter that really does live up to the concept of 'COD zombies' / L4D in VR. It plays really well to the strengths of the VR medium (it's a super comfortable experience) and plays to VR's biggest strength; social! Multiplayer games really are the best thing in VR and One Of The Last does a great job of making you need to work together as a team.For an early access title, it's super stable and performs well on my hardware. It's great to see VR games that aren't just wave shooters and really live up to the promise of surviving a zombie apocalypse with a group of strangers!Can't wait to see this get a full release and the userbase expand - it's got a very bright future ahead of it!"
,Recommended,550360,30325475,Posted: 4 March,all,Mariuz,"This is by far one of the best games for VR out there. Developers are active and listen to every request. It's great game in Early Access, imagine what'll it be like when it gets out of EA, I can't wait!PROS:- ZOMBIES!- Co-op and Multiplayer- Powerups- Progressive unlockable mapsCONS:- Need more players!"
,Recommended,550360,31509145,Posted: 2 May,all,Neuvron - Virtual Reality,"Alright so we tried the game in single player and here are our thoughts about that part at least:We played like 45 minutes of the game.It has a cool concept of ""constant going forward"" in the game, where you earn money by killing zombies and buying new weapons and unlocking new areas. It's a very active game and the flow of zombies is pretty constant and scaling. Graphics are good and yeah, def a game you can play with a couple of friends, even if you go single player.We play a lot of horror on our vr gaming channel so we wouldn't say this game is super scary, but it has it's moments. Especially when they start getting close and you forget to buy ammo.This game has potential! So sure, try it out. 12 bucks isn't the whole world and the devs seem serious so this game is a keeper. Now every game in VR has its flaws and we thought the teleporting was a bit off, especially in the first map with the alleys. But, nothing that cant be improved.In general, a good game. In our clip you can see the waves of zombies, if you like fast forward 1/4 into the clip. Basically it's like that throughout the game (at least for the time we played it).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j86t8Mh9098"
,Not Recommended,550360,28607767,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,STEREO,"Left a positive review back in Jan, but sorry to say I'm retracting it.  I had high hopes for this game, but so far the development progress is disappointingly sub-par, IMO.  This game no longer even comes close to competing with other shooters.  The sound is HORRIBLE, to include lots of crackling and popping, guns went from sounding beastly to sounding like cheap airsoft guns, volume is all over the place.  Teleport controls are the clunkiest I've seen in a shooting game, thus far. AI is ridiculously flawed. In all, it was too annoying to play for even 10 minutes.To the dev (or the guy who told me he was the dev):  I'm not intrested in a discussion. Maybe try putting more time into YOUR game, rather than Counter Strike."
,Recommended,550360,34511022,Posted: 26 August,all,Baysyde,"The description for this game says ""Inspired by COD Zombies"" and they mean it.  Nailed it actually.  It feels just like COD zombies and I love it for that.  Nice little touch with the nail gun and repairing the windows.  That was cool.  My only real complaint with this game is that I couldn't find anyone to play with.  I tried to host a game but found out that it requires you to wait in the lobby while you try to find people.  I really hoped I could play and people would join on the fly.  Still totally worth picking up though.Feel free to check out my experience with this game in the video below if you so desire.https://youtu.be/aOg4TuFmF24"
