,Recommended,550580,30331453,Posted: 4 March,all,Lady Dawn (NeedtoKnow Gaming),"If the Doodle series by JoyBits Co. Ltd. had a cousin with cute graphics, imaginative combos, and pop culture and video game references then that game would be Sticker Craft. The music is great, the artwork is cute, and you'll lose track of the hours as you try to work out all 221 combinations.I was browsing the Steam queue late one night when I happened upon Sticker Craft. I happen to be a long-time fan of Joy Bits' Doodle games and so I didn't think twice before making this purchase.By the time that one catchy song--with lyrics!!--played, I had created a lake and some standard objects from the starting elements, water, fire, and wind and I knew I had to write a positive review.Here we go.For those of you who have never played a Doodle game, the object is simple: try to make all of the possible items/creatures in the game by selecting combinations of two elements. You start with only a few elements and, upon combining those, you begin to expand your collection. Elements fall under one of four categories: nature, man-made, creatures, and uncombinable.Sticker Craft is a bit different in the you have a bag and a screen. Your bag holds all of your elements while your screen acts as your work space. You can swap between both by right clicking on empty space in either and you can add elements from your bag by left-clicking individually. You can also add several elements or multiples of one element at a time by right-clicking; they get added to a bar at the bottom of the screen and hitting the check mark will transfer them all in one go.Any element from any category (except for uncombinable, which is denoted by equal signs on either side of the element's name) can be combined and elements can even be paired with themselves.The more elements you have, the more difficult it becomes to think of new ones--but don't worry. The game has a hint system that unlocks after you've created 20 elements on your own, which will show you four elements of which two are guaranteed to react when combined. There's also a ""to be unlocked"" menu, which will show you five blacked out images of the elements you have yet to create with the elements available and their names. Some combinations are simple and straightforward while others will take some creative thinking.What gives Sticker Craft a leg up on games like Doodle God is the gaming references and the special ""Wild"" stickers that appear when conditions are right. I won't spoil any combos (there's a guide for that), but I managed to create Goat Simulator and was rewarded with a new sticker simply for sitting idle for a moment to think.The game took me a little over 4 hours to get all of the combinations and subsequently all of the achievements. It would have taken me more time had I not looked up a guide for the special combos after finally throwing in the towel..Pros.Fairly priced for the content.Cute graphicsThe gameplay is simple, but it requires you to think creatively.Intuitive U.I.The BGM is catchy (subjective).Cons.Very little replay value.Some of the combinations weren't very logical (subjective).Bottom Line.At 1.99, Sticker Craft is a steal--even if you're not a fan of the Doodle series. If puzzles are your thing or even if you're looking for a nice little distraction between titles, I recommend this game.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs-up.

,Recommended,550580,29364937,Posted: 19 January,all,BluePaw,"I've just started playing it, but this is one of those games you don't need much time to understand it.You start with 6 stickers: four basic elements (fire, water, air, earth), tool, and a sticker for any [wild] stickers that may appear.It's pretty much like doodle god. Combine certain stickers (sometimes the same sticker) together for a result.The only down side is thatthe music comes at you very loud (hopefully the dev can lower it) andthere's no combination history. The game does tell you if you've found a sticker that cannot be combined with anything else, however it doesn't tell you if you found all possible combinations for one sticker (maybe, again I'm early into the game so I could be wrong.)You are given 3 hints per day, so use them wisely. This game is meant to make you think, but don't be afraid to take breaks now and then when you feel you're stuck.It's recommend, on your part, to make a list of combinations that worked and didn't work. How you manage that is up to you as long as you can make sense of it.Update: Audio issue fixed.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish."

The more stickers you unlock, the harder to find the rest stickers - because it will take forever to mix every sticker with every sticker, but you have hints - names of the stickers you haven't unlocked yet + the game shows stickers that are not mixable with anything.+Steam achievements+Steam cards+Cheap!-Pretty toxic settings menu color palette, good thing the main screen is okay.The price of the cards covers most part of the games price so it definitely worth it, and this is a PURE casual game so it would fit 5 or 55 years old."
76561198174655965,Not Recommended,550580,32089283,Posted: 31 May,all,KaiserPinguin,"Sticker Craft is a puzzle (and to a certain degree a logic) game where you combine two stickers to get a new one, e.g. combine FIRE + WATER to get STEAM. Altogether there are 220+ stickers which can be obtained in a matter of a few hours.Pros:- Easy to access- Some combinations that make you scratch your head- Some combinations that make you laughCons:- The interface makes it pretty difficult to handle all the stickers you have (done better in other doodle games)- Many combinations are too random and unintuitive- Many stickers are weirdly specific (e.g. winged goat, horned monkey, neko girl)- Many stickers are rather pointless (e.g. there are 4 or 5 different metals that cannot be combined with anything) and usually only lead to one more combination- Many combinations are inconsistent (e.g. combine wood and water to get a raft, combine the raft with more wood to get a boat, to get a ship you don't need more wood but a second boat) and rather keep you guessing than figuring out a puzzleAltogether, to me the game fails to be a puzzle game as often there is no objective and logical way to combine stickers. More often than not you just try random combinations in the attempt to get a new sticker. Many combinations are rather based on puns or inside jokes which you may or may not comprehend. It becomes a chore after you have found all intuitive combinations.For these reasons I do not recommend the game. Although the game has a fairly low price, you can find better games of this genre for free online (like Doodle God)."
,Recommended,550580,29559647,Posted: 29 January,all,Ɗʊىƙƒαℓℓ ✬,"A decent game with a fair price tag. Lovely simple graphics and calm music. Good hint system with daily limits. I love the distribution of the inventory and especially that non combinable stickers are on a seperate page. There is however a large drawback, which is that there is no way for you track your previous combinations - if you discover that two items combine, there is no way you can retrieve later that information hence you will spend a lot of time repeating yourself unless you keep notes outside of the game."

,Recommended,550580,35268322,Posted: 28 September,all,Raposita,"Sticker Craft is a crafting/combine puzzle game similar to doodle god, but with diferent style and some funny combinations, and others just weird.The game doesn't has a secret, just pick one stick (Air) and other (Water) that combines to a new one (Steam) that you use to combine with others and so on. The game is really short, you can beat it within 2 hours with dedication and paying attention to some little jokes to make the combinations. The game has 2 main screens, the Crafting, where you click on one stick and other to combine, and the Inventory, where you have all the sticks that you've unlocked so far, and cliclking on it make it appears on the Crafting.There is a little button that shows you some sticks that you can unlock, he shows a shadow stick with the name Zebra, and in your inventory you have Black & White stick and Animal stick (There is also horse stick that could make more sense, but I get in there soon.), combine it and ""Zebra"". Some of them are more literal as, ""Horned Monkey"", ""Winged Monkey"" and others. But some of them are just impossible to guess just by the name. ""Rare Fish"" (Ok, let me fish sometime and soon this appears) No, you combine Lake + Dinamite... What? And what about Pirate? It could be simple as Human + Ship, no man, it's Cyclops + Human, what's this? (If it's some mythology reference, I'm sorry, I dind't get it.).The hints are very useful here when guessing by the name is impossible, but you can only use 3 per day. Since I dind't want to use a guide I played this everyday for the last month to get some hints, because I really got stuck on some stickers. In the end I used a guide because of Wild Sticks. They are special sticks that appears with some conditions. Like Rare Fish (A lot) and mountain, no you don't combine, you just put it on the screen and then Cyclops (Wild) appears, so you use Stickerizer (A special stick to catch the Wild ones [Gotta get'em all!] and you can use it).There is also the Day and Night cycle, that follows your computer time to set it, if it's before 6PM it's day, after it's night, until 6AM (I think so). Why this exist? Only to get 2... 2... TWO!!! Wild Sticks, and nothing more (I think it's only 2 because I played all this game on afternoons, and changed clock to get those).The soundtracks is 2 musics, really happy and that, somehow, works very well with the game, the bad side, it's just 2 musics, end one play the other and restart.There is a lot of combination with some jokes, others that just don't make any sense and others that is too much literal. The game is good, the soundtrack got me, even been only 2 short musics, and after a time annoying too, but the game has no dificult and what is hard to combine it's because is impossible to guess without a hint or a guide. The game's price isn't good in my opinion, for what this game could be, yet it has a lot of sticks on the game that could combine to get new ones, right now it has 221 stickers, but while playing I bet I did more than 300 ideas for it. I hope the developer (s?) can come with a new update with a lot of new sticks, because isn't hard to make new ones, the art style is really kid in my opinion (and yet I love this kind of art). You can buy it without fear if:-You like indie games;-You like cheap games;-You like fast games;-You like kid art style;-You like puzzle games;-You like to say to yourself ""This makes no sense.""But if you want something ""harder"" I recommend Doodle God games, and you can play on your browser for free...63/100 ""Good, but could be better."""

Rattles your brain and keeps you thinking about what might be possible - and only gives you 3 hints per day so you don't overuse it. Very nice game for a low and completely justified price.

(we all must earn our food from somewhere)But the combinations... In the beginning no problem. You develop a feeling how detailed and serious you have to combine. The further the game goes towards the finish the more absurd the combination become. Logical paths sometimes are very different.SampleWagon + Energy = Car - Okay. Makes kinda sense but...Bird + Electricity = Plane...in real life I would come to the calculation ""Bird + Electricity = grilled chicken"".Or how would you combine to get a pyramide? Stone and Sand? Wrong! Its Mummy + Cabin. ...a cabin??? I dunno.Dont get me wrong: on a base on its own it all makes sense and is fun. But the kind of logic switches too much for my taste. If the combinations are abstract, then I would prefer to have also abstract results.Nice little game, but I have seen structured ones (may it be serious or surreal ones) for free.Sorry, I cant recommend, even though it has its funne moments."
76561197970585058,Not Recommended,550580,29626360,Posted: 1 February,all,Varkster,"Pros:+ The graphics are very nice; colourful, cheerful and well drawn.+ It runs very smoothly, so (probably) doesn't need a powerful PC.+ You can turn the music off and put your own on.Cons:- The music, nice enough first time around rapidly becomes one of the most irritating things in existance. And its it supposed to glitch at the vocal part like that?- (The one which killed the game for me) The interface.The interface has a 'scratchpad' of stickers you can try and combine. You also have a 'bag' which contains the stickers you have unlocked. The problem is that 1) Opening the bag is very slow and 2) Every time you combine something, you the two combined stickers disappear and you have to open the bag to try and find them again if you want to continue to combine with them. Without trying it, you possibly don't understand how annoying this is; but for me it's a game-breaker.Compare with the Doodle titles; there you have two filterable lists which are available at all times, and you combine items in one list with those in another. This UIworks.The one in Sticker Craft simply doesn't. Finding a new combination is not rewarding; it's damn annoying. As you have to (slowly) open the bag and find the sticker you combined. And then (slowly) open the bag and find theothersticker you combined. And then, most probably, (slowly) open the bag and find thenewsticker, as some stickers combine with themselves. I simply don't understand how the developer thinks this interface in any way helps the player.If you like 'combine' games like the Doodle series, it may be worth a look. And there's a posibility that I'm missing something in the way the game works. But after the 20 mins required for a review I actually got more pleasure closing the game and heading for a refund than actually playing it."
,Recommended,550580,29364706,Posted: 19 January,all,Thredith,"Even though I've just bought this game, I already like it quite a bit! Not only does it look nice: it also offers lots of different combinations. It may seem similar to Doodle God, and well... yes, the premise is pretty similar (for not saying it IS the same premise). However, after trying some basic combinations, I've already noticed the results can be very surprising and original. In fact, unlocking some stickers requires special stickers that can only be found at certain times.If you like games like Doodle God, you'll definitely like this one!BTW, controls may seem tedious at first... that is until you discover that right-clicking takes you to your sticker album, and that it's also possible to add multiple stickers at once to your ""combination"" screen. Also, the cool thing of having a ""combination"" screen that's separate from the sticker album is that you don't have to suffer by trying to remember which combinations you've already tried, simply because those combinations that work will disappear from your combination screen automatically. Of course, you may retrieve the stickers you used from the sticker album with one click. Oh, and if you get your combination screen full of unused stickers, you can simply empty it by selecting the corresponding option from within the game's menu (bottom-right corner of the screen)."

Hints show you 4 different stickers and tell you that two of those can be fused together. Besides that, there are no way for you to know if you have fused everything with a sticker or not (the game however tells you when you find a dead end in fusions).All in all, just stay away from this game.

,Recommended,550580,32513422,Posted: 17 June,all,Quaggy,"As you've no-doubt suspected, it's a lot like the Doodle series, and, as others have said, some of the combinations are (in my opinion) ridiculous.[Spoiler Warning!]For example, a monkey is made by mixing a Caveman with a Forest. Huh? Animal + Tree I'd get. Human + Forest might make some kind of sence (but not really...). Caveman + Forest is just plain weird. And this is hardly the only example. Want to make a Workbench? You might think you'd need Wood + Tool/Hammer, but you'd be wrong. It's Ore + Tool. Horns are not Knife/Axe/Tool + Animal/Dinosaur/Bull, oh no, that'd make sence. Nope, Horns are Animal + Stick. If you can logically explain that, then you'll love this game. Otherwise, you'll likely be frustrated.[End of Spoilers]As frustrating as the illogical combinations are at times, there are guides to help you find all the combinations. (The in-game hint system limits you to a certain number of hints per day, which makes little sence since you are just going to then proceed to go online and get the answers. At least the hint system still lets you feel like you figured something out.)All that being said, the graphics are cute, and some of the combinations made me laugh. If it was a $5 game, I'd probably give a different rating, but this game is $2, has acheivements and cards, and is reasonably fun for that price point. The fact that I got a Water Sticker Emoticon and a few hours of fun out of the game makes it a worthwhile purchase, in my opinion."
