Archaica is without a doubt such a game because it does everything it wants to achieve in a mesmerising way.Archaica is a light redirection puzzle game. It contains 87 separate puzzles that split into 6 chapters with a total of68 campaign puzzles, and19 side quest puzzles.The player is gradually made familiar with the basic puzzle mechanics in the first chapter and more intricate mechanics are introduced in the following chapters. Generally speaking you have to direct light beams of different colors through crystals of the same color by using mirrors, splitters, filters, etc. As to the difficulty curve, I'd say that starting from chapter 3 puzzles are getting pretty hard to solve even though some may be less difficult.Each puzzle of Archaica is very well designed. Your goal is clearly defined and most of the time I had a pretty good understanding of how the light has to be directed in general. Puzzleing therefore mostly consisted of trying to make this general solution work with the limited resources available. It follows that in many cases, finding the actual solution resulted in a very rewarding experience.I never had to resort to fundamental trial and error which is also due to a hint system that perfectly fits my needs. Almost all puzzles have so-called cells hidden in them. Each cell you find allows for a hint to the puzzle. And for a hint you have to select a couple of neighboring squares in the puzzle area and the game will show you in which of these fields you have to place one of your puzzle items ... not which item though. So hints only very gently nudge you into the right direction.Further things to look for in the puzzles are so-called cryptoglyphs. Most puzzles have between two and four of these items hidden around the puzzle area. If you find all of them, you will get some explanations as to the background and the items of Archaica. Which brings me to the 'story' of the game: generally, when you solve a puzzle you will get background information about the history of Archaica or about the Path of Light that you, the player, are wandering on. In my opinion, those text bits add to the feel of the game but I can appreciate that some might find them superfluous, after all they are quite generic.Finally, andquite importantly, the game has beautiful visuals that perfectly support the feeling of intrigue when solving the puzzles. There are deserts, caves, fiery pits, jungles, and more.Having said all that, Archaica stands out amongst all light redirection puzzles I've played and I have played quite a lot. So my advice to any lover of puzzle games is to get it right away, it is well worth it's price! If you think 15€ is too much get it in the next sale."

I suggest using your own music libary if this occurs.Overall I've enjoyed the game with all achievements almost complete and I look forward to see what comes next.
,Recommended,550590,34831272,Posted: 9 September,all,Annakai,Beautiful puzzle game. It has a smooth and clear flow but at the same it cooked my brain in the process of trying to figure out the next step. That's what I was looking for. I followed the game creation basically from the beginning and I'm so proud of you guys that this day has finally come. Great job! You've deserved a recognition!
76561197997938438,Recommended,550590,34958649,Posted: 14 September,all,Ackirta,"It is a very good puzzle game along with the little side tactic of finding the hidden items to help you or for collection achievments.Good:Good graphics,good controls,haven't found any major glitches,good challenging puzzlesI like the background musicBad:A few weird translations to english make for interesting dialoge boxesOne glitch I found is that alt-tabbing appears to ignore the sound volume settings, blasting my speakers with the DING noise - just set my speakers lower and the volumes on the game back to normal to fix.I almost refunded it because when I first installed, all i had were wavy blue screens - found that you have to set nvidia controls to application controlled antialiasing to fix it, so minor but delayed my time playing(edit 9/25/17 - The issue below has been fixed by enabling Vsync in the game and also in the Nvidia control panel, which I am still not sure how it had been turned off.  The game Developers were extremely fast to notify me of what to do to fix the issue, so even more of a reason why I will be keeping them on my watch list)***Appears to be very poorly optimized.  I noticed that on my GTX 1080 on my water cooled system was making major coil whine noises, and when I checked on MSI afterburner, it immediately maxes out the GPU to 100% even while in the menu.  What makes no sense for it though, is that it is only showing utilization of 1.2GB of the GPU memory when I have 8GB available.  I tried every combination of changing the graphics options settings to see if anything changed, and there were no noticable changes to anything (including game look/feel/no tearing on movement).*** Fixed, don't fail the Vsync check...***Still a great game, and I am having fun with it and feel it was totally worth the price.  I hope they fix it to be more optimized soon, because I dont want to have to increase the music volume to try to cover up the coil whine...*** No longer an issue***Now it is just an amazing game, and totally worth the price if you love a good laser beam and puzzles."

As with any good game of this type, the harder puzzles leave you satisfied with that ""click"" moment of understanding."

,Recommended,550590,35220482,Posted: 26 September,all,Elyot,"Really solid puzzle game. The puzzles themselves are very nicely crafted and very logical, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t gotchas or tricks. Most of the puzzles have solutions that are unique (at least up to some trivial adjustments), and you can usually logically deduce what the solution needs to be, rather than just messing around until something works. I'm a big fan of this type of logical puzzle design as it feels a lot more satisfying to solve!I found the narrative to be pointless but you can ignore it; it doesn't get in the way at all. There is a clever little hidden object minigame if you get bored."

Collect items, unlock hidden secrets, solve challeging puzzles, and relax to the music.  A very good game!  I have not completed it yet, but it's so compelling, that I cannot stop playing it and I plan to complete it.I am having as much fun with this as I had with Khaba.  Moving lasery bits to solve puzzles is really my thing.  I hope it's yours, too, because this is where it's at!"
,Recommended,550590,34918160,Posted: 13 September,all,Miathan,"Great puzzle game. As a kid, I was enchanted by one of these old light reflect games, in the early days of PC games when people ran MS-DOS. Archaica is like an evolved, modern version of that. The visuals are beautiful, the sound creates a nice ambiance and a magical feel to your actions. There are plenty of different puzzle pieces to influence light in many ways, from reflection and splitting to teleporting and refracting.There are two things that I find less good. The first is the story. It doesn't matter much, but if you're going to put a story in your game, make it fitting. This particular type of story is not one I would put in a puzzle game. It seems at odds with the atmosphere of the gameplay.Second: the difficulty. Maybe it's because I don't play puzzle games often, but this game is hard. I often find 4 or 5 near-solutions, where I could solve the puzzle if I could turn one mirror into another, or have one more tile of space. Sometimes after a long time of staring at variations of what I already made, I find the ""real"" solution, but sometimes I don't.There is a hint system, but it doesn't help with this. Knowing the location of a piece but not knowing which piece is supposed to go there barely reduces the difficulty at all. The only thing that worked for me is using the hint system to get all locations, but then it's suddenly very easy and just a matter of swapping stuff until it works. So instead, I've been using the solutions post on the Steam discussion forums when I really couldn't figure one out. Usually it's one small thing that I missed. For example, ""a color changing lens can be used to change the color of 2 orthogonal beams"". I had one puzzle all figured out except for that one fact. The hint system does nothing in that case, except funnel you into the right direction until by pure coincidence you stumble upon the solution.I think this game could benefit from a difficulty setting, where the current, single-solution game could be the highest difficulty, and one lower (medium) could give you a few extra tiles of space or an extra mirror here and there, to allow for secondary solutions for the non-hardcore puzzlers.Conclusion:Great game, as good as puzzle games get, as long as you don't care too much for story and don't mind a high difficulty."

Very nice first by 2mammoths.If you liked the witness or Talos principle, this feels similar, perhaps the story could be somewhat refined (some narration would enhance the game imo, but i love voice acting so might be biased) but great intellectual workout"
