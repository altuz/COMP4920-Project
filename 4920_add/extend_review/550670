,Not Recommended,550670,29171243,Posted: 10 January,all,GrumpyPixel,this game is just awful. its like an unfinished unity game. you walk around at 2 miles an hour clicking left mouse to do a very slow punch or kick animation over and over until the npc also moving at 2mph dies then you move to another level and do the same thing plus the sound of the npcs is so irritating a constant groan like your fighting zombies. just a bad game not even worth the £3 price tag. i should get a refund out of principle but im lazy

It's highly immature, using the humor that an 8 year old might find funny, it has buggy AI, bad physics, and an FOV so narrowed that it gives you a headache. Oh, and should I even mention that this is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ re-release of the game ""Garbage-Day""? It's like the dev abandoned that game because it had poor reveiws, then just remade it in to the steaming pile of crap under a new dev name. Funny thing is, Garbage Day actually had some substance, this game has none. I got bored after 2 minutes. I really suggest you save your money and buy something worthwile.TL;DR - This is a rehashed garbage day with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ immature humor, bugs, framerate issues, and an fov so bad it hurts my head."

76561198043663357,Not Recommended,550670,32742024,Posted: 24 June,all,PaleMimic,"I’m going to start this review by pointing out how fitting the title is for What the Heck, Dude? because within the first five to ten minutes of playing that’s exactly what I was thinking. It’s an odd game to say the least. With no real explanation to why you should be playing it. The AI is shoddy, the controls are off and you could spend hours doing not really anything of note.Let’s explain.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The premise of What the Heck, Dude? is that you’re tasked with killing everyone in each level. Why, I have no idea. But from what the description on Steam’s store front said you’re drunk and so everyone has to die, as you can tell in terms of story it’s certainly up there with some of the greats. All sarcasm aside, there isn’t really all that much to What the Heck, Dude? You punch people with left click, which causes all the zombie like people of the level to waddle toward you, groaning and farting as they go. You have to then spend a fair amount of time trying to kill them and not get yourself killed in the process. It might sound quite straightforward, but sadly the hit-boxes seem off. Sometimes you might be standing directly in front of the enemy and somehow miss them, usually resulting in a quick death. The best strategy, and use that word very loosely here, is to hit and run. Basically punch one enemy and then let the rest of the horde form an orderly queue behind you. It’s like a really rubbish conga with no music, no dancing and lots of death.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So far I feel like I’ve slagged off the game, with good reason. But I’d like to point out that What the Heck, Dude? does have something going for it, the graphics. The colours and textures are very simple, but it’s a welcome thing. The geometric shapes used for the various objects and player models are pleasing to the eye, along with the bright colours. If graphics were what made a game then What the Heck, Dude? would certainly have gained some positive feedback.Also there’s a bit of variety to each level. From prisons to graveyards to office restrooms, they all contain different assets and area sizes, making it a little more difficult to create the desired conga affect.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sadly though the sounds and gameplay, if that’s even what you can call it, really knock What the Heck, Dude? down.There may have been some big idea behind this game, but clearly the transfer between paper and actual application differed a fair bit. What the Heck, Dude? literally feels pointless. I, alongside many other people, might’ve overlooked the point to the game, but it’s unlikely. A lot of time and effort might’ve been put into making this game and I credit the developer for that. But I doubt there was any actual testing involved.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall I’d have to say there’s very little I can say to big up this game. The graphics are quite nice, but that’s not exactly a selling point. Unsurprisingly I found it drunkenly clawing it’s way out of the depths of the Steam store. What the Heck, Dude? is glaringly a very pointless game. There’s no real reason to even play it. The controls are awkward, the sounds are weird, and the story, well let’s not even go there. Good Day!"

,Not Recommended,550670,29174408,Posted: 10 January,all,Green,"Imagine Paint the Town Red, a good physics based fighting game where alsmost anything can be your weapon in a fast paced and fun fight to the death. Now imagine if the movement speed was turned down to a crawl, the physics were removed (this game is described as a drunk fight simulator with realistic physics but there is only one time when physics come into play and that is when you or an enemy dies going limp and flopping to the floor, and even that is nowhere near ""realistic physics"") and also that all of the interesting ways to defeat your foes were taken away and replaced with 2 forms of attack, a slow punch, and a slow kick both of which just cause the enemy to stumble (and that is all in a prerendered andimation, hardly ""realistic physics"" to me) and there are no items littering the map for you to use against your foe you just stand there puching each other till one goes limp, even the concept of dodging your enemies attacks is impossible because you can inly move forward, backward, and rotate back and forth. Overall this game is absolute trash worth less then a dollar, 1/10. Something must have happened between the early access version and the current release because all of the pre release reviews are possitive while the post release ones are all negative."

,Not Recommended,550670,29209897,Posted: 12 January,all,Smoothie Wolf,"Looked interesting, but ended up being a bit of a disappointment and a chore to play.What The Heck, Dude?advertises itself as a brawl sim with special use of physics mechanics - do note: unfortunately you're setting yourself up for failure when both your ""brawl system"" and ""physics"" are pretty poorly executed.The game just doesn't have any substance, it feels pointless to play with no real sense of progression. Gameplay feels buggy and tends to glitch a lot, making it frustrating to play.Verdict:A bit of overall polish and some variation in gameplay would've really helped, but unfortunately it just ends up being a bit of a waste. There are similar games available on steam that are much better and worth your time.2/10★"

There is nothing from the devs. This game has promise and potetntial, but seems to have been abandoned. I had a decent time playing, it played well, there seemed to be a lack of ways to fight, punching and kicking, and there seemed to be two types of each, however which you used seemed random. All and all I would recomend this if you have extra money to blow and want a quick game to complete. It was enjoyable for the 0.9 hours I was able to play it.
