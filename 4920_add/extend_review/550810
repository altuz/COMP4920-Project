76561198037157856,Recommended,550810,28232503,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,trottier.wong,"This game appealed to me because not only is it cheap, it has a style that isn't made too often nowadays.GameplayAbduction Bit bills itself as an NES-style arcade platformer, somewhat similar to Ice Climber and Bubble Bobble.However, if you know your gaming history, this is nothing like a NES game at all. If you grew up with consoles, this is much more like what you'd find on a Colecovision. Or if you were more into 8-bit computers, like something you'd find on an Atari 800, MSX, or Commodore 64. In other words, think of this as a pre-NES platformer.The best way to describe this game is that if you put Donkey Kong, Montezuma's Revenge, and Bubble Bobble in a blender, this is what you'd have. There's one touch deaths, precise jumps needed, and a particular sense of timing.You are an alien who must incapacitate some humans with lasers -- you have to be very careful with your laser because it takes time to charge. After they're incapacitated, you must touch them -- which will get them transported to your flying saucer. You have to freeze them up when they're close because the humans are only incapacitated for a few seconds. If they touch you or shoot you, you die.GraphicsThis game uses a basic colour palette with black background overlaid on a 4:3 TV approximation with scanlines. The game it resembles most is Montezuma's Revenge.I have mixed feelings about the approach. The 4:3 approximation actually reminds me of what I'd see on 8-bit computers when they were using an FM modulator. However, the scanlines look nothing like what I'd see from a CRT display. Ironically, most modern games have a hard time emulating CRTs of old -- there's a reason I still keep a 15-year-old TV for my Sega Genesis.Be that as it may, I do like the graphics. Pixel art is a big fad right now, but developers always seem to dip into the well of NES/SNES allusions. So I'm happy the developer was inspired by an earlier era of gaming, one which younger generations may be oblivious about.SoundThis is the worst aspect of Abduction Bit. The sounds effects are shrill. Just the act of walking is annoying as hell.I don't know why the developer went with such a basic approach to sound effects. 8-bit machines of this era had great sound. Take a listen to the SID chip of the C64 or the PoKEY chip of the Atari 800. Even the Colecovision was capable of playing decent chiptunes.Frankly, I feel this was a missed opportunity for Abduction Bit. A good soundtrack could have taken it over the op. Instead, I had to mute the whole thing.ControlsThe game advertises itself as having full controller support but I wasn't able to get it to work with either a Steam or Xbox 360 controller. So instead I used a keyboard.Thankfully, the keyboard is a breeze. You use the arrow keys for movement, ""z"" to jump"", and ""x"" to shoot.All the same, you're going to have to be extremely tight with how you move because this game is unforgiving. It's easy to make the wrong jump or shoot at the wrong time. This game has one touch deaths, and if you run out of lives, you have to start from the very beginning. There's no checkpoints in a game like this.SynopsisOne of the great myths about PC gaming is that you need an expensive rig to play new games. What isn't often mentioned is that PC is the best format to play indie retro games -- and these games don't require high end hardware. For those of us who want to play new games that utilize a retro style, PC is the promised land.Abduction Bit is one such game. It isn't exactly authentic. The art is accurate, but the scanlines not so. As for the sound, it's awful.However, the gameplay is wonderful. If Abduction Bit had existed in the 80s, it would have found a good home on my C64. Or hell, if it was an arcade game, I would have welcomed it in my local pizza shop.This is recommended if you love early platformers."

I just love the crazy arcade type sounds and simplistic gameplay which has you just getting that little further with each attempt! At the price it's a steal with achievements and groovy cards! It just has a certain charm and worth every penny!
76561198061815441,Recommended,550810,31430081,Posted: 28 April,all,crazycupmuffin,A little game that will throw up feelings of nostalgia for the tiniest of prices.Played it for 3 and a half hours straight. Loved every second.Tonnes of levels.Old skool sightsOld skool soundsIf you liked bubble bobble back in the day. You will feel right at home here.Deserves to be in your steam collection.
76561198010134705,Recommended,550810,33062918,Posted: 30 June,all,Selva,"Bought this on sale for 49 cents.  (USD)  I figure if I play it twice I've saved a penny on what I would have spent in an arcade in the 80's.  So, win-win.   And, since I will likely play it again, I'm leaning in the ""recomend"" direction.  But, for two quarters, (4 when not on sale) you are getting a classic style arcade game.  And, not a bad one.  The levels are shorter and easier than, say, Donkey K.  But there are more of them.  Supposedly quite a few more.  (I've seen 7 so far.  That's almost double what the big monkey had.)This having been said, there is a huge list of quibbles and things this game REALLY needs.  [It doesn't auto recognise a joy pad, It REALLY needs a level builder.  The level packs are hidden in a settings menu.  Etc.  Adn.]So, overall...  If I'd paid more than a dollar or two for this, I'd be unhappy.  It will very likely get played once or twice more and be part of my library of cool little games I play on ""rainy days.""  But, at the price I paid, I'm fine with that.  I've already gotten my two quarters worth.  Everything past this is a bonus level.  8)"

Love the feel, love the characters, decent level and trap variation. I'm happy with it. You should pick it up while it's on sale, because it's well worth the 49 cents and I paid 99 cents, so you can't go wrong either way if you're into classic arcade style games. It's along the lines of Donkey Kong and Burger Time."

Fun for 2 players, it just needs a lot more maps and harder maps would be always welcome! I found it to be too easy. But for the price I wasn't expecting too much and am satisfied.My fav thing about the game is the silly car honk as it approaches."

I got it for 49 cents and to be honest, it's worth every penny and even more."

,Recommended,550810,33420140,Posted: 9 July,all,GarBenjamin,"I've only played this game for 32 minutes so far but already I can tell you this is one of the most authentic retro style games I have played.Everything from the graphics (with the exception of perhaps the vehicle that comes out around level 6 on the 8-bit mode which seems closer to 16-bit to me but this is not a big deal and maybe I didn't pay close enough attention to it since I was busy playing the game) to sounds, controls, game design and even (maybe especially) the little delay and tune playing at the end of a level and before the next level starts... all seem spot on to me.To put this into perspective I was playing these games 30+ years and have continued to play them ever since.My only real complaint about the game would be the delay in firing the stun gun BUT I realize that is a big part of the game play balance and strategy. I do think the delay could be reduced a tiny amount but you know... even that is very authentic because I often thought the same kind of same when playing the ""real deal"" games.SUMMARY: Perhaps the most authentic modern retro inspired game I have played. It is very well done and is enjoyable to play. I hope the devs continue to make more retro style games like this one."

If you die you need to do all levels over and over again and I just don't feel like it.Pros:+ Arcade Like game+ Nostalgic Feelings+ Fun to spend some time inCons:- Some small bugs- Everything is kinda the same over and over again- Controls are somehow a bit weird in the beginning (I want to move and select stuff in the menu but, I just didn't know how. Later on I Thought Hmm maybe use the Z-key and that worked!)4.5/10 Feels quite Nostalgic but I just don't liked it a lot. If you are a fan of Nostalgic arcade like games then Buy this. I mean €1,- or €0.49 on sale. So why don't buy it!"
