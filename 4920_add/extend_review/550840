Loving it's overt he top horror theme that  reminds gives you splatterhouse vibes and  liking the idea of a roguelike where your equipments are the body parts of your enemies.  Now imagine that mechanic doing exactly what it says on the tin, with each bits having  a pool of stats it can be, variations  of the same parts from the tougher/miniboss version  of the enemies, beiong able to get the parts  of bosses  granting you their abilities, being able to  upgrade them by mixing  parts  of  the same type together AND  being able  to  upgrade them  further by crafting accesory body parts such as wings and hooves to graft onto them. All wrapped up in an over the top horror theme  that's not only gratuitous to  the point of hilarity but also geniunely disturbing at points.THIS is a game that's  going places, REALLY REALLY good places as they add new monsters and the ability to  get parts  from existing varients.  It's fun to mess around with  different parts and if you're a ♥♥♥♥♥ for numbers part combing and acessories are going to  keep  you  going for a while....As long as  you can  get over the Engrish....With a proper translation though  this game  will  be great.Also  for anyone  complaining the  game doesn't  tell  you things, pay attention  to the characters speech as well as tool tips."

We haven't had a decent body part stealing game in almost a decade and that's a shame.1. Nice graphical direction.2. Gory.3. Simple to play.Cons: Everything else.1. No instructions or real directions. It's tiring to see this.  I wish this stupid fad would end. Figuring out the rules of the game is an excellent way to pad play time, not the patience of players.2.  Horrendous Engrish. I'm used to Engrish, but this is a new level. Coupled with the lack of directions, the directions you are given are shoddy at best and useless at their worst. The characters you interact with are shallow, which may not be the intention but when you interact with the ""Pay me to go with you character"" you wouldn't know you -have- to pay that character until after you talk to them. There's no option to say YES or NO, it's just boom, you paid them already.3.  Feels like those crappy Xbox  360 Live games that you waited for to go on sale for a dollar to purchase. Lair of the Overlord , Revenge of the Dungeon, etc. It's the same darn thing all over again.4. The sound effects and little music are grating after the first level.5. The only way to return to base is to either die or complete a zone, but when there's a banking system in place to mitigate your losses.. The problem becomes that the bank machine never spawns.6. I wouldn't call it challenging, this is one of those Square Peg- Round Hole games. If you keep grinding the hole, eventually you'll get through. Fine if you have the patience for it, other than that. No,  the first boss comes out of left field and only after ramming your square peg into it a few dozen times will you actually grind through it.7. Poorly explained mechanics.Okay. There's your health. There's your stress. There's your XP. There's your Energy.At no point does it actually explain what Stress is for.8. Buttons interrupt menus.Accidently pressing the directional on the controller while banking interrupts the transaction.I really wanted to like this game, but at this point in time I can't recommend it."

I play it before the secornd section. Disigners usually update it. Although fresh body is not perfect and lots of scence too big. The best thing attcracted me is story. The protagonist wants to save his sister. So, he goes to an islandthat fulling of mosters and zombie. On the island,the protagonist have to find out some special equipmengts to save his sister.May be l have some mistakes in grammer but l hope you can like fresh body by my comment,thank you."

Took me awhile to learn that you can't outrun the bloodbags so you have to lure them far from the boss so when he tries to heal the bloodbags will take longer time to collect the blood back to the boss to heal. :'D"

,Recommended,550840,34386420,Posted: 20 August,all,<{ÇÇH}×Çarçino×>,"I must say, even in Early Access; this game is quite addicting and much fun. If you like The Binding of Isaac (+ Rebirth) or whatnot, this game-- you most likely will like. I cannot gaurantee considering the fact I'm not whomever whose thinking on getting this game. Though, I thought about getting this game at first and decided to give it a go. This game has a ton of potential and I sure do hope more monsters, maps, and tons of which-ever is coming is gonna come soon. It's quite interesting! Also I really hope there will be a chance to even customize your own character. ;PSome of us like to create our own character, however in this current state. We can only play as a male.Not a big deal, it's just some of us feel uneasy being a ""he"" in game when we prefer to be a ""she.""... If that makes sense.Thanks for reading!~"
,Recommended,550840,33235233,Posted: 4 July,all,Ted Dino,"Fresh Body is a game about killing monsters and then using the parts that may drop from said monsters to infuse into yourself in order to become your own horrific creation so say a monster drops a pair of legs you will then switch your own fleshy human legs for the monster ones which can give you burst of speed if necessary.There may be a few spelling errors but the charmful colours of the game along with the cartoony style of gore soon make you forget about, the controls for movement and that of skills are easy use to use so no problems there.I highly recommend this product for those who enjoyed The Binding of Issac as I feel it reminds of the same play style."
,Recommended,550840,28678221,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Hefutoxin,"Action rogue-like game. Move around an area, killing zombie-ish things. Each zombie has a chance to drop it's head, torso, or legs for you to wear. Then you go through the portal to the next area. After 3-4 areas, you reach a boss monster. You'll occasionally meet people who stay back at your base and do things for you, like repairing ""freshness"" (Durability), cold storage for parts, or allowing you to combine body parts to increase stats.The head, torso, and legs act as equipment, providing increases in attack, defense, health, and/or dodge. Each part also provides you with it's own usable skill. The torso also changes your basic attack, which can range from basic punches to whipping with red tendrils to launching redish balls of something from your chest.If you die, you lose everything you were carrying.On top of that, you have passive ability/skills that you can buy/increase with green vials that zombies sometimes drop. Basic stat increases mainly, along with some oddities mixed in - a sword falling from the sky that increases your attack speed in the area or occasionally adding electric damage to your next few melee attacks, etc. These are permanent and not lost on dying.The coins can be used if you find a nurse to buy healing items, or the blonde girl for a randomized buff (or even a debuff if you're unlucky.)It's definitely worth getting. I look forward to seeing what kind of weirdness they have planned."
76561198007472019,Recommended,550840,30488984,Posted: 13 March,all,BrotherGRim,Promising game...enjoyed the mechanics but the base is a bit confusing (for example can see people complaining they cant store things....and they can)Be good to add a tut screen on entry or give the upgrade guys a bit more of a blurb (eg upgrade the chest to store more items in case you die)Still fun and cant wait to play it again after a few patches!
76561198050046403,Recommended,550840,28276912,"Posted: 9 December, 2016",all,brettstevenson82,"Arcade style perma death; what you get is an addicting game with replay value. Epic fun to be had by all. Some issues would be it needs melee balance because it's near impossible to finish the first stage without a shooter-type body. Needs more content which I expect if successful will occur. My advice for people having difficulity is to max attack speed asap, because faster hits = more procs."
76561198087412577,Recommended,550840,30130620,Posted: 23 February,all,mafaldora,"Even as an early access, I'm pretty disapointed to be honest... I love the concept and the gameplay is not so bad. To upgrade something you need a certain amount of specific items (like 30 and every stage gives you like 3...). But everytime you die, you lose everything, a warehouse would have been a great idea. Except then that, I don't have anything bad to say about it. I like the genre, it reminds me  lot of The Binding of Isaac."
,Recommended,550840,29462905,Posted: 24 January,all,Xinister,"I have to say this game is a breath of fresh air for me, I am a huge fan of rogue-likes/lites and well tbh the only real body snatcher game I know of would be binding of isaac, and I kinda got fed up with that game. Then out of the blue comes a gem like this, at first I had no clue what to do, cause well the game does not hold your hand you have to learn by yourself, which for some might be a deal breaker for others well, I like games that don't hold your hand.The artstyle is absolutly amazing I am blown away by how good this game looks, which I see many of the negative reviews also mention, but tbh I don't get ""all"" the negative reviews (18 negative vs 83 positive) I am aware not all games are every persons cup of tea, but bashing the devs cause of grammar, I mean if their native language was english I would get it, but apparently it is not, so instead of leaving a negative review, maybe try helping them out with the grammar, if your problem is with the grammar, because so far I have understood everything and haven't had any real issues with the dialogue in the game.So TL:DR would I recommend this game? HELL YES, get it now you won't be dissapointed."
,Not Recommended,550840,29041156,Posted: 5 January,all,Trazen4,"Bugged beyond belief. As in, I died once and couldn't ever open the inventory again, even in a new save slot. In the game's defense I didn't restart it and see if that fixed the issue, but by the time I closed the game I was ready for a refund.At one point my character picked up a carrot, a healing item. But I couldn't use it. If I clicked on the carrot, my cursor became a carrot (as part of a click & drag system I believe) but I still couldn't use it. I clicked the carrot again, which left carrot sprite stuck on the inventory slot. Twelve seconds later and one carrot became twenty carrots, all layered over each other. I wish I took a screenshot.I tried starting one more save after to give the game one last chance, but my cursor remained carrot.carrot/10.On a serious note, this game is too buggy for a person who usually tries to overlook bugs."
,Recommended,550840,29537889,Posted: 28 January,all,America Has A Problem #LasVegas,"Interesting game. There's really no direction what so ever as far as plot and objectives go, but they're pretty easy to figure out (hint: the plot seems non-existent).What makes this game fun is the intriguing way that equipment works. You pick up body parts from felled enemies and then mix and match them in a sort of DNA/genetic splicing screen. You have a limited number of inventory slots available (I believe around 15-20), but the only loot drops in the game are attachable limbs so you never really notice the lack of space. For me, that's a nice deviation from the standard loot-hoarding simulator that most ARPGs tend to be.The game doesn't use the mouse at all for combat. You're stuck purely with keyboard for movement, aiming and attacking. It sounds a little primitive, and in some respects it is, but there's beauty in this game's simplicity. You can create some very interesting builds despite the fact that you've only got 4 active skill slots, and this is made possible because every limb you pick up will have it's own unique statistics and/or accompanying ability.As far as actual immersion and enjoyment go, I'm definitely having fun so far. The price tag is more than fair; the devs are consistent and in constant communication with their players :) Besides, if you're a fan of roguelight randomgen dungeon crawlers, you'll have a ton of fun here, regardless of the game's amazing community/devs.I'll give it a solid A rating (updated from a B+ recently cause the devs of Fresh Body are sexy af).EDIT: The recent spate of patches has brought many changes to Fresh Body. Starting area has much more NPCs and fleshed out mechanics. Plus, PS4/Xbox controllers work now! W00T! I decided to put this game on hold until they fixed the issue with having a controller plugged into your pc forcing a CTD, which the March/April updates remedied."

You cant just grab any limb, cause it seems to be chance to drop and only having a few slots didn't make me feel like i could be anything. It would be cool to have each arm different or something like that. Still a quite a bit of fun."
