It get boring for me after an hour or so but that's because I don't love puzzle games. If you like a good puzzle game then this is for you. A great game to test your mental skills. It's cheap and has a lot of levels.

,Not Recommended,551110,28753275,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,Maskerader,"The kind of puzzles I don't like. I got through the first part and still don't have any clue on what approach I should have taken in order to solve them. They are either easy and straightforward or too incomprehensible it was easier to keep pressing things randomly until you get what you need rather than actually use your brain to analize the board, plan your moves and execute the solution you've made up.It is like trying to shoot a target you don't see. Miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, hit. What was I doing wrong? What have I finally done right? I dunno."
76561198112866114,Recommended,551110,34624732,Posted: 30 August,all,kyzka,"Some Einstein has just destroyed the no brainer concept of 'Whack a Mole'!Seriously so much damn thinking is involved in this game that paracetemol will soon become your next best friend. The game never holds your hand and the difficulty curve is so ridiculous that even if i did a brain transplant with a quantum super computer that computer would just melt and immediately look for a walkthrough.Thankfully there are several walkthrough's available which immediately makes me ask who are you people that produce these walkthrough's? I seriously thank all Gods of this world for such heavenly blessings. It humbles me to know that there are people with giant sized Moai brains who not only walk among us, but are willing to devote their time and almighty video recording skills to the common people who like me share the iq of a damp piece of seaweed. May the fanning of palm branches and grapes being dropped into your mouth be constantly rewarded to your steam profile thrones.The game was produced within 2 months by 2 Ukrainian developers found herehttp://www.konstructors.com/. The speedy construction and delivery is all thanks to very minimal UI. There is no high scores, no timers, a limited repetitive soundtrack and 6 levels with a very basic backdrop which merely alternates in colour and sometimes direction. In a nutshell it’s just you and the puzzle.The concept of this puzzle was largely inspired by the game 'Lights Out' the basic concept which is that the adjacent tiles to the one you press will systematically move in the opposite up or down direction. Hence the main goal is to turn all the tiles lights off on the map by having them eventually all pressed down. If you achieve this on all 100 + levels in the minimum moves possible you will be rewarded with the 'final puzzle'. A puzzle so great that it would cause a NASA Super computer to hide behind a couch scared.The tile mechanics are slightly spiced up eventually with 'Special Tiles'. Problem is the game really doesn't properly explain the mechanics of such tiles and more often than not you will only learn the tricks through laborious trial and testing. The satisfaction from this is albeit because of the sudden steep climb of difficulty and many will simply succumb to walkthroughs because of the sheer volume of time needed to be dedicated to this game if one was to choose to go it alone.While I appreciate the fact that there are many gamers who may cherish a difficult puzzler like this, personally the satisfaction I got from it was very fleeting all due to the unreasonable difficulty coupled with poor difficulty progression. Also thanks to its minimalistic presentation there wasn’t really enough to hook me and reel in an enthusiasm beckoning me to progress. Due to the sum of how much time was needed for a trial and error approach and being present in a very busy world with many games on offer, really pushed me to scurry quickly for a walkthrough, and after that moment, any real satisfaction in puzzle solving that this game had to offer was immediately lost.Below is two video's. The first is someone playing 'way out'. The second is 'Whackamole'. If you really got into and excited about the bottom video then this game is probably not one for you!https://youtu.be/CBw9l1V95Zkhttps://youtu.be/eOj0l_g6QhI"

However, the puzzles feel either routine or tedious (depending on how much time they take). Though I have loved many similar games, this one does not feel like it explores a deep concept and, more importantly, I do not think I learned anything about the puzzle mechanic from playing through levels.More specifically, the single mechanic all puzzles are based off of does not generate diverse scenarios. It seems like every puzzle was computer-generated and that it the puzzles themselves would be better suited to an algorithm than to a human. Conceptually, there seems to be little in the way of solution other than brute force. The ""fewest moves"" goal for each puzzle, however, deters brute force."

Blocks are to be pressed in a specific order to make them docile. Blue cubes, yellow cubes, dotted cubes, plus cubes and arrow pannels guide the player into each unique challenge. The goal of each map is to clear the puzzle in the PERFECT amount of clicks, and believe me, that is so much easier said than done.With a respectable 66 achievements, I was not being hand-given these unlocks. It takes a little bit of the ol' brain power to make it past stages and advance onward with much more in store. Boasting badge progression is a nice touch as well. I liked it. Nice change of pace from the general garbage steam pumps out. This is a nice gem."

76561198355036865,Recommended,551110,33255936,Posted: 4 July,all,SealieP,"If you're looking for some easy little clicking puzzles like Oik or Zup, you've come to the wrong place.  These puzzles actually make you work at solving.  In order to actually complete them and do them perfectly with the least amount of moves takes a lot of hard work and effort.  If you love to really delve in and solve puzzles then this is for you.  It's a very simple premise but the puzzles get harder as you go.  I like the added difficuly and nuances they've added to the later puzzles.  If you get stuck, fortunately there are guides to help.  I highly recommend for those who like to figure out more difficult puzzles."
,Recommended,551110,33288921,Posted: 5 July,all,Infiaria,"Unlike other people. I find there's something very satisfying to pushing buttons. It's like popping bubblewrap in a way -- especially because of its quitemechanical/'clean'ishgraphic and sound design? The clack sound when you click is strangely meditative. So points for that I guess.The game is difficult if you try to play it like a proper puzzle game, making you easily stressed and irritated, but for this game I like to just click in a somewhat educated manner -- not focusing on the game, but on some other distraction (videos/movies) until the puzzle ends up solving itself. Even when trying to solve in the least possible moves this kinda works if you just hit R all the time; although you'll be pushing for some time. If anythingdouse the guides to progress, even if you feel like it's cheating. This game isn't easy.It is too minimalistic in some places. It could do with a proper settings page, like resolution, custom colour schemes, and a slider for sound and music which you can actually change inside levels. Though the game's biggest problem is its lack of additional features -- there quite easily be potential for randomly generated levels and workshop support (custom levels) since there's no real reason to start over unless you really like pushing buttons. However, this game is dirt cheap and the game is easily worth its price.And also you can make words in your achievement showcase if you like that kind of thing."

,Recommended,551110,26546263,"Posted: 11 November, 2016",all,OperatorWay,"An inexpensive pastime. The game functions fine (for me) - no problems, no errors, no crashes, etc. The game does not provide any instructions/tutorial or adjustable video settings/configs. When I'm stuck struggling to solve the current puzzle, I wish the game would allow the option to skip it & continue forward."
,Recommended,551110,33512578,Posted: 13 July,all,Illusionary,"Clearly inspired by the classicLights Outhandheld game from the 90s,WayOutis a decent little tiled-based puzzle game that's generally a relaxing experience, with simplistic graphics and a gentle background soundtrack. Of course, the puzzles themselves are key to the experience and in many cases present quite a stiff challenge, especially if you're aiming to solve the puzzles with the minimum possible number of moves - I'm not ashamed to admit to having referred to a guide to help with a fair few of them.As you get towards the later puzzles, there are some interesting variants to the standardLights Outpuzzles, with special tiles that behave in different ways from standard ones, and it can be quite satisfying (albeit briefly) to work out each new mechanic and how best to make use of it to solve each puzzle. The one major criticism that I have with the game is linked with this, though, to an extent - while the game doesn't really need a tutorial as such (and doesn't have one), the puzzles don't necessarily come across in such a way as to teach techniques for solving later ones, instead feeling in large part to need a trial-and-error approach. Overall, though, the game easily justifies its low price, with its 120 puzzles providing a good length and the game's positives outweighing its drawbacks."
,Not Recommended,551110,31316128,Posted: 23 April,all,MrHoover,"First of all, I would like to say that this is a fairly good time killer. However, once you complete some levels, it doesn't say that you've done it. It gets repetitive extremely quickly, and sometimes the levels are almost identical. It is a very hard game with good graphics, but because of the gameplay, I’m afraid I can’t recommend it."

Or if you are good at figuring out the pattern before even clicking anything.The goal is to make all the squares go down. Each colour set has a different 'obstacle' square to work with (one that connects to all the squares around it, one that is a stopper when you turn it off, etc.)Cons:-Not all levels have achievements.-No option to turn off animation on the level selection screen, so you have to wait for them all to pop up before you can play which gets really annoying near the end levels.-Have to perfect every level to open the final one (this means making them all not yellow)."

,Not Recommended,551110,29771560,Posted: 7 February,all,nAhk1s,"So, the game starts out nice and smooth. The music is very relaxing and the game gives you this feeling that you're gonna enjoy your time playing. But after a while it becomes very displeasing.  The game actively tries to break my bubble and make me feel like the dumb donkey I am and pushes my low attention span to its limits. Even though random tile pressing sometimes gets rewarded it doesn't happen every time... It has to be a bug. On some levels this one red tile is left on the field even if I do things exactly the same way as last time. On some levels after finding a solution the game tries to tell you that there is a way to solve the level with less moves by leaving the level yellow on the map. This ofcourse is utter bull**** because it's impossible to solve the level faster and its only in the game to make me feel stupid.  This discourages  me in real life sitsuations to jump in an argument (which I preferably know nothing about) acting  smarter than I actually am. The game tries to define me as a person which is directly comparable to r*pe and I'm propably going to sue the developer."

Completing the levels may not be overly complicated, but doing them in the fewest moves possible is a different story."

,Recommended,551110,26687092,"Posted: 19 November, 2016",all,Raios,"WayOut is a nice puzzle game where the objective is to push down all blocks in different shaped grids in minimum number of moves. When you press a grid, all adjacent blocks react to it. Also there are some special blocks react differently.The game has no tutorial or any instructions but it's actually very easy to understand. Every time a new element added to the mechanic, the game gives a few easy tutorial-like puzzles that makes you get it in no time.With the calm background music WayOut is a relaxing puzzle game until you reach the really frustrating levels. :)There were some minor bug problems but the dev actually listens what people say and react to them. I'm sure all problems will be fixed in no time.WayOut is a nice challenge for a very low price. Can't wait for the sequel. ;)"

WayOut is definitely a good bit of fun, a solid little time waster, though it's only a few hours worth of game play.  Feels like an app you'd buy (or download for free) on your phone, but well worth the whole dollar you'll spend."

It's a cheap puzzle game that can keep you occupied for long periods of time. I'm not one to get immersed in these types of games, but I made an exception. For those of you looking to get this game, prepare yourself for some rage inducing levels towards the end! :DI would just say that after listening to the music for a bit, it gets really annoying, but that's fine. :)"

76561198041636869,Recommended,551110,33544267,Posted: 14 July,all,Brother Alpha,"WayOut is a puzzle game where you click on a square to make it go up or go down and all of squares touching it also change their position. As you continue the game, new squares with special rules are added and the complexity begins to increase dramatically.If you like puzzle games, then this is certainly worth the $1 to buy."
