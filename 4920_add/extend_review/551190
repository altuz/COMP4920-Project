,Not Recommended,551190,26401359,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,dawhoopmaster,"I've waited ages for the release of this game! I've seen the development from start to finish, watched every trailer when it came out ETC. The first Slaughter Me Street was quite lackluster, whilst still holding up as a game I liked. And I like this one, too. However, when I think about what I've played, afew things spring to mind.This game is short. REALLY short. I only brought the game this morning and I've already finished it. Slaughter Me Street 1 took me a little longer, but that was held up by difficulty. Talking of difficulty, this game lacks it. Whilst with afew moments that are a little bit hard, comparing it to the difficulty of the 1st game its not there.The game started out playing fine. but in the later levels, there was lag, floating puppets lying on thier side in the air and broken AI's who didnt acknowledge that I was there and just walked past. There were also many poorly animated jumpscares, the worst being one where I clipped right through the Seeker's head and saw nothing.Another thing I was expecting was to get really scared by this game. However, fear factor is none exsistant here. There wasn't a single moment where I felt like I might have a heart attack or poop myself like the first game.So I have a hard decision to make here. I really want to like this. I've hyped this game up from its announcement to now. I've played SMS 1 and Retro, and both of those were really good. But I have to weigh two scales here. Should I not reccomend this game because its too short, too easy (then again, I'd be complaning it if was hard) and mildy broken? Or should I reccomend it, because these bugs weren't entireley game breaking and, albeit short, was a fun game?The game is good, dont get me wrong. I liked it. But, as you play more and more, you figure out thats its not everything its  cracked up to be. Sadly, I must be the first one to not reccomend this game.I feel very bad not disreccomending it. Team IGS worked really hard on this game. And im the one who must take it upon themselves to post something bad about it. If IGS reads this, I want them to know I like this game, but there is alot missing to make it an overely satisfying product.But I still have hope for this to-be series, though. What do I mean...?!!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!!You have beaten the game, right? Or you just dont care and like ruining game endings for yourself, huh? Ok, well, as we know, the closing line is ""There is another..."" and various text before that reads ""Until we meet again"" and ""Salvation awaits"". Im sure this means a 123 Slaughter Me Street 3 is in either planning stages or development. So, if John and Nate are reading this, here is a list of things I would like to see in SMS 3:BALANCED DIFFICULTY:Not as hard as SMS 1, but harder than SMS 2. More, normal than hard mode like SMS 1, or Easy mode like SMS 2. Infact, thinking about it, a difficulty selection would fit.MORE LEVELS:Im fine with the 17 levels of SMS 1 and 2 combined. However, in 3, I'd like to see abit more. 20, 30? Maybe even 50! (Of course, that might be stupid. 20-25 would do)FREE ROAM:This isnt necesarily a change, but I preferred the free roam of SMS 2 over the restriction of SMS 1. So, free roam again, please.MORE PUPPETS:In SMS 1, there were 3. In SMS 2, there were 4. Maybe some new, intersting puppets with the combined reutrn of The Follower, Greeter, Waiter and NIghtmare. Also, Hunter, please. He was cut once again.BONUS CONTENT:This was a problem I had with SMS 1, but SMS 2 didn't fix it. After you've finished the game, I'd like some Extra content to keep me playing rather than what I've done with these 2 SMS games, which is finish them and never play them again (probably). Im not a very eager completionist and the Relics of SMS 1 and Golden Coin things in SMS 2 dont make me want to carry on playing JUST to find them. Anyway, back onto the bonus content, a prime example you can take is FNAF 1 and 2's custom night. Im not saying directly copy that, hopefully you can come up with something original and something that gives the player a bit of creativity, like a level editor or something."

The house is quite a bit smaller than expected, but the game is still really fun to play. This game is probably one of the scariest I've played to be honest, trust me, it will get you numerous times as you play.ProsYou have an entire house to hide in.The monsters are terrifying and can move pretty fast, amping up the scare factor.The safe spots are a life saver and are vital to playing the game.ConsThe jumpscare animations could use some work.There is no multiplayer which I was really hoping for.The Hunter got removed again, but is apparently being added in soon.The house is a lot smaller and it looked a little bit better in the greenlight trailer.This game is hard. Like, really hard. Currently stuck on level 8.Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who loves horror and likes a good challenge. Happy hiding, slaughtermenauts!"

Slaughter me street 1 ushered in a different style and was quite innovative in concept, slaughter me street2 I find does the exact same thing and I personally believe that it's only a matter of time before this game erupts in popularity, it's slowly taking over youtube so it's just a waiting game by now. I personally find graphics to be a little low in resolution but the gameplay alot with the clever mechanics make up for it. It's amazing to see how far these developers have come and even though this game took a little while longer then expected to release its ddefinitely worth it.

This game is terrifying if you have that overwhelming fear of hiding and behind found. This is not your average scares, this is psychological.

There's something about hiding...and then being found that makes it so terrifying.Dives into a deeper fear of being dragged out under the bed or having burglars raid your home kind of stuff.

The game is so good, so scary, so scary that when typing this in, i haven't completed level 1. If i didn't check this game out. I would never had been a fan of a such fantastic game. I really love it. The game is literally hide & seek. First you have to hide different hiding spots, then you'll have to seek the objective, then the exit.When you are at exit/seek (when you know where the objective is) far into the game, your heart will beat fast (At least my heart did)The first time you play, you'll get very scared. I even sometimes punched my nose (And I get blood in my nose easily. Don't worry it didn't happend xP)IGS really did an amazing job on this game. The backstory....... well it's pretty sad.... buy the game (if you haven't), to see what i mean.Funny story: When I first saw the game I was like ""Wow fine game, but i'm not interrested""*Sees flashlight* ""Maybe i should look into it""Here is a list of pros and cons and what I think the game needs.Pros:Hard when you get far inGood Atmosphere, when you walk around the house.Unique IdeaSurvival Mode & CollectiblesCons:No footstep sounds when monsters walk.Some bad optimizations (Maybe it's just me)No options menu, to change graphics or keybindings. (You can change the graphics a little bit, when you launch the game. Don't worry XD)Meh Jumbscares.WTGN (What The Game Needs):An bigger options menu fx. Graphics, Keybindings, etc.Some more gamemodes.Better optimizations.Footsteps when monsters walk.An ability to change difficulty (Easy, Hard, Medium and maybe Hardcore/Very Hard)I know there isn't any reasons to make a WTGN list, when i already say the cons. But... whatever .Overall amazing game. Deserves more attention. But the price should maybe be change to like 10-12 dollars, instead of 15.

(Or at least in my opinion)-Terrifying creatures-Very eerie sound tracks-Runs smoothly (for fairly decent PCs at least)-Achivements (something I think more horror games need)-Lights Out mode, making everything dark and tense.-Free Roam-Amazing graphics!Cons:-Focused more around gameplay than story, and that might be good depending on what you look for in horror games.-A bit to easy for the main Story Mode (the 10 levels)-A bit of a lack in animations, it would've been cool if like the creatures moved they're arms whilst opening doors or closets as to just the door flying open with them just walking by-A pretty tiny map, maybe they could add in additional rooms in the coming updates.-The creatures don't run at you rather they just speed up but it's still easy to out run themThings that could've made it better:-More animations-More secrets-Another creature (perhaps the Hunter)-More unique mechanics (kinda like the Screamer and flashing him)-The Nightmare actually being able to chase you around the house and not just him chasong you in the back yard-More/bigger rooms123 Slaughter Me Street 1+2 are with out a dought two of my favorite horror games of all time, I hope you guys do decide to make 123 SMS 3, altough it is unlikely, but like John Kolbek said himself ""Anything can happen ;)"".

Now you can replay the game to find all the achievements and 100% the game.Cons:-Once again, gameplay gets repetitive-Game is poorly optimized (That may just be my PC though) I can run other games perfectly fine, I have a gaming pc with a GTX 1060 and I still experience freezing and fps drops. Once again, this may just be my PC.-Game is pretty short, the only thing t hat makes it longer is the difficulty spike, which goes up drastically between levels.-This game shouldn't be $15.00, it should probably be brought down to like $8 or $7, that's just my preference though.""Why do you recommend this game if there's the same amount of cons as pros?""
