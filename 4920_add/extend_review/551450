,Recommended,551450,32155421,Posted: 3 June,all,MiracleAttack,"This is a great little game. Deceptively simple at first, until you're literally overwhelmed by the difficulty that creeps up the longer you survive.You can pick this up to kill a few minutes at a time, but there is enough meat in this game to keep you playing for longer sessions. The achievements are actually challenging-- and while I'm not too into competitive games, I find myself wanting to beat the person above me in the leaderboards.Controls are great, and the randomization keeps the game fresh.The price is right and the developer seems to be active and incredibly responsive to feedback. I wouldn't think too hard if you're on the fence about adding this to your library."
76561197982940738,Recommended,551450,32677378,Posted: 23 June,all,JtheSpaceC,"You know what? This game is a lot of fun! I don't normally go in for simple high score repetitive games, but I really enjoyed this and found myself saying ""just one more turn"" for easily 20 turns after I thought I'd quit.There's a lack of meta game or anything, but its price is right. It's really fun to drop in for a few minutes.There's another key here. There's a variety to the gameplay in the form of upgrades, and temporary ""flying tank"" bonus sections. The game you're playing from one minute to the next can be quite different, and each variation on your fighter feels different, too.I really like the enmy design, graphical style, and especially the destruction mechanics on the larger ships. It feels great to blast off the engines on an enemy carrier and watch it topple. That's not to say it's easy. You still have to get to that side of your targeted enemy, which is sometimes impossible to do without dying, so you flee instead.The game is hard, and one criticism is it basically devolves into circle strafting large groups of enemies eventually, but what game doesn't, frankly?Another criticism is the sound. It's not bad but a little lacking. The music is great, but the SFX lag behind a little. Still, overall this is definitely worth a go and you'll find you keep coming back."
,Recommended,551450,30219831,Posted: 27 February,all,[MoeGamer.net] Pete,"An excellent little shmup with a surprising amount of tactical depth to it. Beginning as a straightforward blastathon, the ""upgrade"" system gradually introduces new mechanics such as holding your fire to be able to launch missiles and repair yourself, eventually culminating in becoming a ""tank in the sky"" to rack up enormous scores. You can play with keyboard, mouse or gamepad; for once, I actually preferred the mouse controls to gamepad, since this isn't really a ""twin stick"" shooter as such.The music and sound effects are a bit weak -- the music in particular has a very ""'90s MIDI"" feel to it and doesn't really have the ""energy"" about it that a game of this type deserves -- but the stylised graphics fit the game well and the way everything explodes into pieces is enormously satisfying.It'd be nice to see some better music -- or just a bit more variety to it, since there seems to only be one track at present -- in a future update, but for now, this is a solid and enormously addictive shoot 'em up that is a great addition to any score attack junkie's library."
,Recommended,551450,30223797,Posted: 27 February,all,Heinzy the Ketchup,"This is a pretty great, hectic sci-fi shoot 'em up! Set on a rocky planet, you fight increasingly harder and more numerous waves of enemies, which randomizes each day, to defend the mothership and to score points. When you destroy, you unlock upgrades like a space tank.The gameplay is solid. I thought the keyboard controls were stiff but using your mouse works great though it takes some practice to get the hang of it, which is how it should be! The grafix are simple, but appealing. The distinct shapes and colours of the enemy ships make them easy to identify, though I do not know if I have encountered all of the enemies yet as the game gets pretty gosh darn hard quite early on! The ship physics and destruction are other little great things that add to my enjoyment. Big ships will break apart as they get destroyed and will crash into eachother and the environment below. Better yet, crashing your ship into other ships can destroy them!The biggest issues with the game is the music and the sound effects. The music does not match with the intense dogfighting that is going on and is somewhat out of place. As another reviewer put it, it does not have the energy that would be suitable for this kind of sci-fi action. Same goes for the sound effects; the massive battles are not accompanied with sounds fitting the explosions and lazers. That is something I hope the developer will improve in the near future. There seems to be room for further expansions to the game, which would probably be pretty nice.Other than that, great little game. Worth the cash? Sure."
,Not Recommended,551450,32006825,Posted: 27 May,all,Darksmiter,"I wish steam had a maybe option or something in between yes or no, because I would give this game a maybe, depending on how future updates come along.This game is very simple and that is good in some parts and hurts the game in others. The game resets the leader-boards every day which is an interesting take on a ranking system. The mouse-only control scheme is also pretty interesting and feels great (with the exception of poorly timed upgrades that can send you flying away from where you intended to be). The game has a minimalist UI (to the point of it not being there, really) The problems come with playing the game for too long. There are only seven different enemies, which means the randomized waves every day feature is barely noticeable. You often die because of something randomly firing from off screen and hitting you twice (miners are the most annoying). You'er weak and have no real way of telling how close to death you are (no health bar, your ship flashes when damaged, that's all). Bigger enemies can only be hit on weak spots, which makes sense, but everything that isn't a weak point blocks your shots from hitting other place on enemies (you can't even shoot through destroyed weak spots). There are only two upgrades, one adds missiles that work on a cool-down that you have no indication of (which is annoying because you have to stop shooting and start again to launch them), and the other turns you into a tank. The tank feels nice, it is slow and powerful and can ram a lot of enemies to death, but if it takes too much damage you become even slower and lose the ability to ram anything, wasting some of your time flying slowly waiting to lose the powerup. Then you star back from your base ship. Some achievements are either a grind or require you to be the best at this game, (looking at kill 10,000 jets, play for 10 days, and finish the day at rank #1) which is only really an issue if you are an achievement hunter. But they also feel set up to inflate game time.At this point, I would only get this game if you really want to compete. I would wait to see what comes in the future or a sale if you really want it."
,Recommended,551450,30226254,Posted: 27 February,all,Chman,"Surprisingly addictive. Best played in short sessions in my opinion. It gets intense & hectic pretty fast (and that sweet, sweet screen shake! You can reduce it in the option menu if that bothers you). It's purely a score attack game so don't expect anything more from it.Like the other said, sfx are a bit weak and the music is 'meh' at best. I'm not sure I fully understand the point system, it either needs some work or some clarification. But other than that, considering the price, it's great entertainment assuming that's the kind of game you're into."

Especially with the latest twin-stick controls update, moving and shooting overall feels very fluid, which is a huge benefit to the high speed / high risk shoot-em-up theme that this game seems to go for.Pros:-Good controls-Great visuals, destroying stuff looks and feels awesome-Easy to learn with simple mechanics-Difficulty curve isn't insane-Seemingly bug-freeCons:-Lacking in the audio department-Only two ship upgradesAs it currently stands, this game is super fun, and I expect to continue playing it on and off. I think the cons of the game are easily addressable, and I wouldn't be shocked if they were worked on during this game's lifespan."

Battle through rapidly increasing hordes of flying enemies in a hard-hitting but thinly armored fighter jet.

76561198011716213,Recommended,551450,34494439,Posted: 25 August,all,the10kan,"A very entertaining arcade shooter best played in quick bursts. The player's goals are to stay alive, upgrade their craft by reaching certain numbers of kills, and protect their home carrier from ever-more-numerous packs of enemy carriers.With the addition of the latest upgrade (1.3), Furious Angels is finally a game I can recommend without caveat. The firepower bonus consolation prize each time you survive losing the flying tank makes the difficulty ramp steadily for much longer than in previous versions. The decision to switch recharging missile salvos with a main weapon that simply fires a stream of missiles at the 2nd power-up level is also much appreciated."

76561198108269527,Recommended,551450,30233131,Posted: 27 February,all,quantum_jak,"This is a fun shmup with permadeath.  The game sets itself apart in a crowded genre with game mechanics that differ from many 2D shooters. The game's controls are very simple, but they belie the depth of gameplay. Instead of assigning everything to different buttons, you only repair and reload missles when you are not firing. Your vehicle flies like a jet, meaning there is no instant direction change, no hovering, and no sideways strafing. As you gain upgrades, your vehicle increases in power and eventually becomes a turretted flying tank.This is really one of the funner shmups I've played. Gameplay is fast and frantic. There is no time to get bored."

Art direction is minamilistic and awesome. The game FEELS very good. Good sense of speed and explosions. For $7 it's worth the money. But I want more. I want so much more. I love the feel of this game so much and I just want more of it. More ships, more upgrades, more enemy types, more levels, more weapon types, more customization for different challenges.I only have two cons that I will state as criticism requests - A) let me customize, to some extent, the difficulty of the game (really I just want it to start on harder wave after I get used to the game). B) when the game gets chaotic it feels awesome, but it's a little hard to see incoming fire. It becomes almost like a bullet hell but you can't quite tell what's going on. Somehow just clean that up visually.But overall I really love this game. I just want more!! :)"
76561197985661478,Recommended,551450,33885749,Posted: 29 July,all,Hamster Mk 4,"This game has a surprising amount of depth for such simple mechanics. Rewarding the player for focus targeting specific components on large ships creates a nice David vs Goliath feel while disencentivising the normal strategy of flying away shooting backwards. The ""Tank Mode"" is a briliant way of implementing changing the game dynamic for an ultimate mode. While its firepower allows the player to output terrible distruction its lack of mobility prevents the player from avoinding incomming fire. Instead of an artifical time limit on the tank mode, the player can use it untill it has absorbed too much fire. The play sessions seema artificaly limited by the difficulty ramping up beyond what is physicaly possible to deal with. Also while the ambient music is nice the game is lacking in sound effects considering the ammount of shooting and explosions that are happening on screen. Overall this game is great value for the price."
76561198023637559,Recommended,551450,33160167,Posted: 2 July,all,Omunall,"Not a terrible game but lacks a lot of depth.. Developer responds quickly and there is a beta that allows for some screen fill options for larger displays. Got the game running at 4k now, buttery smooth. The game has some interesting mecanics and the way lives work, sort of feels like a shooter mixed with asteroids. It's actually quite fun, I just wish there were upgradable weapons, loadouts, etc. For that it has, basically you can upgrade into a slightly tougher ship that seems to do a bit more damage, and eventually a slow moving tank. You basically get ONE shot type, and some missles. That's it. I've seen games like Dragonia (porn twin stick game that noone should play) with tons of awesome meta, but really bad overall. If this game had that, it would be beautiful.That's about it. If you stop firing for a second you get a missile barrage that you can let off making timed shots nice, but playing with the game pad makes accuracy a pain to get on the results. Overall I can reccomend the game as what it is, a fun time waster that has a developer that is looking to make a sequel. I'd hope to see some new mechanics added as load outs, weapon switch (multidimentional array, global settings, pretty simple stuff) just needs weapon effects, some already present such as a laser from the mother ships. Really would do well with some rpg or rouge lite mechanics, make this game so much more addicting.Also if you blow up in the first two modes (normal ship and heavier ship) you loose. If you blow up in tank you revert back to the speedy little ship to attempt to gain your tank all over. Sort of makes it hectic as you have tough enemies, so has some value. I don't know if the developer plans on doing anything to this game as comments of fancy stuff are waiting for a sequel, rather than improve upon the base to gain an audience to gain a sequel.Giving a thumbs up to help the ratings. Simple and fun but barebones. I want to see this game get bigger and add those rpg/rouge like mechanics. The gameplay would do well with it and make it so much better, so buy it so we can get a real full fledged game. For now, a fun time waster for work or when you just don't want to sit down and really get into anything but still want to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up and throw your controller at the wall when you screw up."

Feels great with the mouse or a gamepad, but the mouse is definitely more precise, if less comfortable. There's less variety than in Luftrausers, but Furious Angels' difficulty curve feels more satisfying to me so far, and the upgrade and heal mechanics make for some interesting situations. Learning new tactics has been rewarding.I'm the kind of person the soundtrack was made for. It's repetitive and methodical and matches my feelings during play. It's a good loop.

It doesn't feel like you're really ""flying"" a plane, but the inertia is good and everything is very responsive.This game really needs more content. It's right on the borderline for a sellable game.

,Recommended,551450,30395635,Posted: 8 March,all,Raketenziesel,"Gorgeously looking, challenging and surprisingly tactical fun short shooter.Here upgrades are not simply more of the same but require different play styles (a tank crashes everything), each of the two  has it's own strengths and weaknesses, which means you have to prioritize targets differently.What's missing is a bit more variance in music, upgrades and enemies. Also would like if your own carrier would have a bit more an active role.Since the game also currently lacks any deeper tutorial I highly recommend reading the somewhat official guide here:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=877545455The enemy spawn order slightly changes daily, so it's worth revisiting.If you're somewhat competitive and use a mouse the game is well worth it's money since you will be stuck in the short game loop (normally way less than 5 minutes) for way longer than planned, since mastering the deadly enemy waves is quite rewarding.Never stop flying.

Furious Angels is an exception.Yes, each game will probably last five minutes or less.  Yes, there is no grand strategy involved.  Just reflexes and think-on-your-toes sort of tactics.  It is so very well executed though; probably the best game of its sort that I've played in a long time.The basic mechanics are rock solid; the controls are smooth as silk, the difficulty ramps slowly and steadily because of a well-designed wave pattern and consistent upgrades.  If you dawdle, you can easily get overwhelmed in the early stages, but FA definitely rewards good play.  Though there is some luck involved, in what game is there not?tldr: I can heartily recommend FA for any shoooter enthusiast, especially if you're looking for something you can pick up for five to ten minutes and then put right back down.  If that's not your bag, probably don't bother.  This is a niche game which fills its niche very, very well."
