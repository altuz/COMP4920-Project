,Recommended,551690,26610556,"Posted: 14 November, 2016",all,Echo,"Counter Fight is a simple game that starts slow and increases in speed until you eventually can't keep up. It has a simplistic aesthetic that works well for it, and I think it does what it aims to do pretty well. Although I would recommend the game as is, there are a couple of issues I hope the developer can address:• The in-game tutorial fails to explain how to deal with the robber (throw stuff at him). It also fails to explain the energy drinks that the cheerleader/attendant provides.• The frying pan has a tendency to clip into the stove, making it diffult to cook without holding the pan.• The dumplings sometimes interact with each other and/or the pan, violently. This makes cooking dumplings much more of a pain than it should be.• The beer bottles have a tendency to fall over when placed in the fridge, emptying themselves.• Bad collisions/physics, especially with the beer in the fridge can lead to repeated clipping sounds, which gets annoying fast.• There's no way to undo a mistake. If an uncooked dumpling falls onto the plate, or you place the wrong item in the ramen, you can't remove it. This requires you to throw out the item and start again from scratch.• Items can be selected easily from their respective containers, not so much for picking up items from elswehere. Dumplings in particular seem to get stuck on the counter with limited to remove them.• The fridge door can be opened with the handle, but closing it via the handle doesn't seem to work very well.• Sometimes customers seem to ignore the food placed in front of them. Picking the food up and placing it back down usually fixes it, but if the timer is low, this can mean the difference between success and failure.Despite these issues, the game is very much playable, and it is quite fun."

My only two critiques right off the bat:1: I kept accidentally hitting menus.

,Recommended,551690,28963848,Posted: 2 January,all,arleas,"Have you ever wanted to run your own Ramen noodle shop?  I know I sure have... except I don't know the first thing about running a Ramen noodle shop, I hate cooking in real life, and I'm broke after buying the HTC Vive, Video card and all these games.So what's a guy to do?  You buy ""Counter Fight"" obviously.  It's not a simulation so much as it is a test of your endurance.  頑張って！So anyway, you can do the tutorial which tells you the bare minimum to get you started running the show yourself (highly advised) and you also get some time to get used to the controls.  Why would you need time to get used to the controls?  Well because they suck...You have a left hand which you will use to do everything that requires the use of your hand, and if you're left handed, great! This is one case where you'll feel at home.  Then you have a pair of chopsticks on your right hand which you use to pick up food and transfer it to the plate or bowl.  If there was a way to switch from chopsticks to hand, I feel like this would be great... instead I'm playing most of the game with one hand tied behind my back because I only need the chopsticks towards the end of preparing a meal.It's not really a problem (having the chopsticks in your hand permanently) but it's not really a pro either...especially when the fridge/cooler is on your right, and you have to turn around to open the door but you can't use your right hand to put something IN the fridge.  You have to use your left hand again which feels awkward and unnatural.  If you only have one hand though, then congratulations! you'll feel right at home and won't mind.So once the game is really started, people file in and your cheerleader in a cheongsam starts shouting いらっしゃいませ to all the incoming customers, you're presented with a picture of what they want over the customer's head.  Pretty simple.  From the minute they sit down a timer starts counting down and so long as you provide them with their food within the time limit, you get paid.  Take too long and they'll storm off and leave you with an angry face mark.  5 angry faces and it's game over.There's Ramen, Gyoza, and ビール (beer).  Ramen has a few different extra ingredients to it but it's pretty simple. Gyoza is easier since there's only one type and you just have to cook up 6 of them and serve it.  Beer is even easier since you just put the beer in the fridge, close the door, open it again (magic!) and then pour it into a glass and serve... toss the empty bottle over your shoulder for good luck and keep going...This on its own isn't much of a counter fight.... but occasionally you get robbed... during a robbery, all your customers cower in fear (and their timer stops so hey! BONUS!)  and you are encouraged to grab something and throw it at the guy threatening you.  As long as you hit him he'll leave.  Don't do anything or don't hit him fast enough and he'll take your money and run.Anyway, it's a fun little game and it's cute and all, but that one hand and one set of chopsticks thing is annoying.Pros:You get to experience a bit of Asian culture and now you finally know what's going on when Naruto asks for Ramen.  (You'll even hear them refer to the little swirly bits as Naruto!)It's easy to pick up without worrying too much about the menu.  Even if you know nothing about making Ramen, the tutorial has y ou covered, and the orders are easily displayed.Occasionally your assistant will hand you a drink...I'm not sure what it's good for though.Cons:Grabbing items like the ladle, plate, fridge door and beer has to be done one handed.  Grabbing food is done right handed... Unless I'm an idiot in which case I'll update this review (watch this space to see if I'm an idiot)Everything seems to happen so fast that I don't get the chance to hit a ""zen"" state where everything just flows. If you wanted a game you could play in short bursts, this is great.  If you wanted to just enjoy the experience, it's not as great.  They should make a mode where you can just play at your own pace (maybe with more complicated orders but no timer)There's not really a lot of depth to the game.  If you ever get good at making Virtual Ramen, you'll feel stuck in a rut in no time.Overall I'd say it's a great game and it would be a close contender for the best food prep simulator in VR...VR the Diner Duo is better  in terms of control and variety but the complexity of their dishes kinda stresses me out quick, where this game has much simpler menu items and it's all about speed.It's worth buying though...I've had a lot of fun with it already."
,Recommended,551690,26667629,"Posted: 17 November, 2016",all,DLX,"Counter Fight is a solid game, and can get pretty intense as more and more customers start coming in. A lot of the difficulty comes from the wonky physics that make doing certain things (like frying dumplings and putting beer in the fridge) harder to do than they ought to be. This can lead to some funny moments early on, but I can see getting a bit frustrating if you're seriously trying to get a high score. There is only one game mode and replayability isn't very high, but the art style is cute, music is catchy and gameplay is enjoyable enough for the price.Check out my playthrough of the game:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=801644303"

Surprisingly a fun little game similar to Job Simulator but much more fast paced. Recommend the quick tutorial and then have at it!I'd give you some tips but honestly I don't want to give any part of the game aways since it's not that in depth.
,Not Recommended,551690,29171177,Posted: 10 January,all,axelhunter,"This is such a hard game to gauge. I enjoyed playing the game, but ultimately didn't feel like my money was well spent. For VR games, the price is fair. Think of this game more as a Tapper arcade style game. You have a thing you do and you go as long as you can before you fail. Get the high score! As that type of game, this is a fun one.Two CONS:What you see in the trailer is what there is. I can't find any way to add more ingredients or dishes to your menu. It's fun, but I imagine this will get tedious quickly. If this were early access and more was promised, I'd let it slide.At this time, the dumplings are impossible. I'll see if I can link a clip at some point, but every time I grab the pan to pour out the dumplings (which looks slick and smooth in the trailer) they go flying as soon as I click the handle. I feel like my score is halved by the number of times the dumplings have done me in.That said, the game itself is quite fun. It's got a great charm and whimsy that is endearing. But between Diner Duo and Dead Hungry, there are better, more lasting experiences for not that much more money. At the start of VR, we got a million shooting galleries with more everyday. But acrade cooking games seem to be slowly gaining momentum, and I'm all for it.Ultimately, if you can spend a little more, get a longer lasting VR cooking game. If you already burned through the others or need to spend as little money as possible, this is a fun if frivolous entry."
,Not Recommended,551690,28933515,Posted: 2 January,all,Yung Idol,"The game itself isn't bad. It's quite fun and hectic, HOWEVER, the area it places you for the game is right at the front of your play area (for me, right in front of a brick wall where my TV is mounted) and when you're handing off the dishes to the customers you have to reach outside of your play area.Maybe some with larger play areas won't encounter this but I have refunded due to the fact that, without moving very slowly while handing over a customers order, I can't safely play this game. It's unfortunate that the developers did not include an option to change your placement and after researching I have not been able to find any mention of this feature being worked on. If that changes in the future, I will most likely re-purchase. For now, I'll try The Diner Duo."

The gyoza making was especially painful. The gyoza always jump off the pan, making it impossible to put up a plate without trying half a dozen times.Placing a beer in the fridge was a little annoying but manageable.The ramen making was fun.Otherwise, with a few minor changes (adding a restart option, music control)  I think I would really love this game. But, unless they fix that, I would definitely hold off on buying it."

It's pretty much exactly like you see in the trailer. Customers will come asking you to make them different types of ramen, serve them beer, or make them dumplings. There are also robbers who will come, and you have to throw something at them to make them go away.The ramen is fairly quick to make, but it is a good idea to prepare the food/drink for the other two customers in advance since it takes some time to prepare and they usually demand it fairly quickly. The game gets quite tricky as you progress farther though, because the customers start to come more quickly, and it gets hard to prepare the beer/dumplings since you are just trying to meet the current demand.There are a few small bugs though. For example, when you place the beer in the fridge, sometimes it will act crazy and start jumping all over the place. Also, it is quite difficult to close the fridge door sometimes. However ,these issues are minor, and I didn't find that they took anything away from the game experience."

She did a great job keeping my spirits up, motivating by shouting to me what I assume were encouraging words in Japanese. She always was nice to throw objects at without consquences.

More takings equates to higher game score.  Being a Japanese game you also get a token cheerleader enthusiatically encouraging you within the Kitchen - you also get an armed robber who makes an appearance every 2 minutes who'll rob you of your takings if you don't throw the frying pan at him to get rid of him!The graphics are simple and bold but they work perfectly for this type of gaming environment which basically is - Minecraft graphics in a Minecraft style graphics with Japanese stylization - they work very well IMO!

This game has a great art style and will surely scracth the itch of the type of gamer who likes games like Cooking Dash. I'm really looking forward to the day when the somewhat wonky physics have been corrected. The physics are EXTREMELY frustrating if you're someone who wants to power through to a high score like me. Puting beer in the refrigerater or frying up the dumpling shouldn't be as physically difficult to do as they are in the current version. My wrists started to hurt after a while from my attempts to try to manipulate the unpredictable object rotations. I'd like to see objects like the ladle and frying pan automatically lock into an ergonical position. The game is difficult enough as more customers enter the restaurant without the fridge door malfunctioning and the dumplings flying everywhere from moving the pan the wrong way.All of that said, I recommend it as a work in progrss with the hope that the physics issues will be resolved very soon."

This is game is so good, it gets my first ever review on Steam. If your into any form of Cooking simulator this is something to go for. It's not very pricy either and it's a really intuitive game. Overall it's a must buy for anyone who owns a virtual reality headset.To the develepor (if you are reading this, great game!)I quite like the art style of this game. I would however add someform of pausing with out needing to go into the dashboard (I used the HTC vive). I would also add  more intuitive menu to the, well... main menu. Maybe some options for settings, maybe turning some functions on and off,turning the thief on and off (it was funny at first, but it just got annoying afterwards, I got the game for and maybe even setting the difficulty. I  found making the fried dumpling a little hard and glitchy, when I try to take it off the stove to plateall the cooked food would end up flying everywhere and just glitching out. I found this so annoying I would completly ignore the people who want dumplings because it was a terrible experience making them.Changes I would make (and would be amazing to see happen):I would allow the player to control if it was cooking ramen only, dumplings only, something along those lines. Many games have done this too, but you could allow it so we can upload our own photos as the customers while still having the original movments of the original charactrer. As a suggestion, the easy mode could be not having to refrigerate the beer and already having it ready to serve maybe dumplings take shorter amount of time to cook and more time before it burns. Medium mode could be the exact same as it currently is,  and hard can make it that the amount of time people are willing to wait can be shorter, you can't throw things and have it reappear agian, you need to fully ""wring"" the ramen before putting it in the soup, a coaster might need to be added for the beer. As I mentioneed above, maybe to turn the thief on and off.Cool Customization features (that would be nice if added):You could allow it so we can upload our own photos as the customers head while still having the original movments of the original charactrer, e.g. make them have a eating expression, angry, etc. Maybe being able to use the earnt coins to buy a new shop, be able to upgrade things. Maybe unlock a new customer etc.But overall this game is AWESOME it is a must have if you own a VR headset.Thats a long review..."

Putting the pieces in the pot u barely touch pan and they fly way out of the plate. Does it with slight touch. Its ridiculous. Please fix!2. After the thief comes in and scare the customers. I would have the bowl already in front and the customers DO NOT RECOGNIZE that it sits in front of them. Happened like 4 times in one game but always happens in each game. Please fix that. Its frustrating!Other than those two. Very great and fun game!

I must admit that this game is pretty fun although it had a few flaws.  I'm a pretty tall guy and the game didn't seem like it could handle that.  I was always hunched over to see the orders which stunk.  Next there is only 1 level and all of the food is right infront of you so you know there is nothing left to unlock.  Having said that, it was fun.  I'd wait for it to go on sale before picking it up.  I wouldn't buy it again at full price.  If you want to see my experience with this game then feel free to check out the video.https://youtu.be/QcwR2WnmnRY"

I usually have people over to try out vr or play with me and having a relatively short cut off point helps give to rotate people out.Cons:Could use more depth.There is a (as far as I know unfixed) bug where you will occasionally spawn in a bad position. To elaborate: you will spawn on the edge of the boundaries of your play area, but the game will require you to reach over that threshold to play, if your boundary is a couch this isn't an issue but if it's a wall or a tv this will be a problem."

Essentially it's still a bare-bones time management arcade game though.  It would be nice if there was something going on that you worked toward across multiple rounds of play.  Overall it's quite charming nearing job simulator-levels of interaction polish.a few notes:  it would be really great if there were some more hand options. at the very least the option to switch which hand is the hand and which is the chopsticks.  or the ability to pick up and drop the chopsticks so you can have 2 hands for a moment would be nice."
