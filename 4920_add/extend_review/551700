,Recommended,551700,33934337,Posted: 31 July,all,ranXerox,"I started off loading the game and loading time took a while.  After the screen came on at default graphics settings, it looks really good!  I was surprised to find myself at a cantena.  I was able to hear people logging in and logging out and chatting and forming groups for game.I accidently hit a pad and was teleported to a location where a session has started.  Immediatly was in a group (it felt like a group though we didnt need to be in a group and this is very interesting.)  and just following a path to where we were shooting stuff.  Feels really good!  One of our teammates died but we pressed on.After I reached the end of the level, i logged off and I can really say I love this game.The cantena area has spots to where you can upgrade your armor, another spot to where you can upgrade your weapons.  as you progress, you find money in areas of the game for the character upgrades.  This Game is Most excellent!This game spells fun!  The  graphics, audio, presentation is top notch!  It is worth 34 dollars at least so far.I will adjust this review as I Learn more about it."

While it doesn't have a solid story and it goes have some bugs (it is early access after all); the main purpose of this game is to co-op beat levels with friends or random strangers with the goal of getting money which is used to upgrade your gear which also increases your level. Also the graphics, even on the default setting, are really good looking.  Pump it up to the max and you have a slick looking game!I can honestly say, even with the limited amount of time I have played it so far, that this is a special game. Every group of people I played with for the missions were a blast and there were many times we were laughing, cheering and complimenting each other on ""Nice shot!""s as we scrambled to survive the insectoid onslaught.There is plenty of gear ranging from your appearance, your weapons, your shields, your bonus weapon and the upgrades range from attachments to your existing weapon to new weapons. I can only assume more gear will be added as time goes on.The levels are pretty straight forward from what I have played and are complex enough to vary your tactics while working together to beat it.  You will see money canisters hidden throughout the level that will increase your total awarded funds at the end.I have not tried the multiplayer yet but I am guessing it is as great a time fighting fellow players as it is to work with them.All in all, especially for an early access game, this is absolutely worth having in your VR collection.  Its games like this that evolve the VR experience and I can't wait to see where they take it from here."

I love the locomotion and really enjoy being able to switch between teleport and running. I was never a fan of teleporting but it works in this game and I wouldn't want it any other way. For a game that's still early access and is this addicting I'm sure with time it can only get better. Can't wait to see more weapons, more maps and more enemies and maybe even boss battles. Pvp works great too although not many people have been playing  I'm sure it will get better as more people finish leveling up and are looking for Something different to do.  Keep up the good work devs and thanks again for the quick resolution to my problem.!!"

There are a lot of weapons & upgrades to unlock in this game which gives you something to achieve.  The co op is awesome, or you can go it alone.  It automatically lets other players join the ""bounty"" or mission you are on.  There is PvP as well but I haven't dabbled with that yet.  It is in early access right now and I did notice two bugs.  First, the enemies for me where stuttering when moving or laggy when they get close.  I thought this was a framerate issue, but it wasn't.  Second, there is a bit of lag when shooting your guns sometimes."

,Recommended,551700,33961058,Posted: 1 August,all,John S͘teamOS™,"Gunheart boasts a well designed core loop that keeps you coming back for more.While the guns could use some 'juice' to make them more fun to use, the mechanics themselves are solid.PVP is a little underwhelming, it suffers from some serious balance issues with movement and weapon damage.The PVE and co-op is what's really enjoyable, hosting an unlock and upgrade system that gives you the incentive to keep coming back.This game will only get better as time goes on, but what we have now is extremely memorable."
,Recommended,551700,33996899,Posted: 3 August,all,Dr. Acula,"There's something here.In Raw Data, which is another great game I've seen Gunheart compared to, you can clearly see the compromises they had to make to make it work in VR, like level design and movement. Gunheart feels more like a traditional shooter in respect to movement and maps. The way you move through the level, taking cover where needed and actually going taking the fight to the enemies instead of waiting for them works very well.Right now, just after the EA release, there's still a few bugs and judging by what I've seen so far the content needs to be fleshed out some more before the full release. Looking beyond that it has a high production value feel to it and the visuals are amazing. Too many games put you into environments that fail to convey a sense of scale. Gunheart really looks like you're on the surface of a planet that goes beyond the horizon and doesn't stop existing a few meters beyond your chaperone bounds."

Guns are fun to use, maps are enjoyable to play, community is very helpful and considerate. Dev responds to posts in the threads. Very good experience, well worth putting in your VR collection."
76561198092678368,Recommended,551700,34047216,Posted: 5 August,all,ptdean82,"This is great! Great graphics, great gameplay. The co-op play feels extremely natural, the maps are well situated to make location and other player locations really important, and the ability to really support each other really encourages communication and strategy. I was very hesitant to drop $35 on something that just dropped into Early Access but I am extremely pleased.Suggestions for devs:1. The guns and explosion sound effects are not quite satisfying. Give them a bit more oomph. Also, the barrels - make them so if you shoot them once, they start to leak (and will explode), but if you shoot them a second or third time, they explode now.2. The enemies are extremely well modeled and animated. BUT they are not quite satisfying to kill. I'm going to compare this to Halo since you're filling that hole in my heart (for co-op FPS gameplay). Remember the little guys that squealed in terror when you arrived, referring to you as a demon, etc? How satisfying it was to headshot them, or run up behind them and melee them? Remember the hyperaggressive warrior caste that bellowed as they charged at you? How satisfying it was when you finally nailed them with a shotgun, for all their dodging? They had just enough personality in them to make them satisfying enemies to kill. These insect creatures need a little more anthropomorphizing in their body language and sounds. Raise them from pests that have to be exterminated to adversaries that I really really want to make dead."

It's fun and fast paced.I have only 1 thing to ask: steamVR supersampling to be applied  ingame. To play it at least at 3.0-3.5. Ultra setting in options is not enough to make it look sharp.

,Recommended,551700,33939130,Posted: 31 July,all,johngannon,"Updated review - this is hands down my favorite VR game to date.  It's got depth, replayability and is just all around what I was looking for when I bought this rig.  If you are sick of the demos and ""experiences"" then this may be just what you are looking for.  Still early access, could use some work on animation and working out some bugs but overall this is the game I was waiting for.Not just target practice like so many other highly rated ""games""!"
,Not Recommended,551700,33961270,Posted: 1 August,all,Egore,"This game claims to have Single-player in the store page, this is a lie. This is an always online game that forces you to play multiplayer, when they say ""Single-Player"" they mean, you can start a mission and complete some of it alone before someone automatically joins your game.**INPUT LAG**Every action you make including pulling the trigger of a gun is server side, so if you're unfortunate like me and live in the 3rd world forgotten mystery island known as Australia, this is a game of Space Invaders when there's only one Space Invader left and you have to shoot where they're going to be because none of the weapons fire when you pull the trigger, you have to wait up to 1 second for the bullet to leave the gun. Because of this issue when i ran into a group of flying bug enemies I had no choice but to run away as I couldn't aim and shoot flying enemies with the input lag that the game forced upon me. (The developers have said that they are adding more servers to accommodate more regions but this shouldn't be a problem at all. There should be a single player component especially if the game advertises it).The game however, looks really good, the customization looks interesting and the way other players look in game is cool but I cannot personally recommend this game for these glaring issues."

It has about 10x more content than most other VR games and its social aspects make the game very replayable! It is EARLY ACCESS of course and therefore has bugs.

No its not , is this game borderlands VR ? No its not. what is this game? its a space bouty hunter that kills aliens, wierd alien dionos and gets paid."

This is the first VR game I have found where I have been able to spend that much time on it. Upgrading your gear and weapons is addictive in the same way on such games like Destiny or Borderlands.The Devs are awesome and listen to the early adopters about what they want to see in the game. They have updated it so every week there will be special missions to do. Theres loads of guns to choose from and it seems many more to come.The movement in this game is the best I have experienced in any VR game with loads of options.Lots of achievements to unlock new gear and weapon upgrades. In my opinion people are just too quick to write a negative review. After a few hours I guarentee you will be hooked.How could you not be!"

I  was weary of paying $35 for an EA game, but it seems to be worth it!Wanted to update my review after having some more play time: This game is great! The combat is intense and pretty fast pace. There are a bunch of different weapons to unlock, and upgrade and it changes each gun noticeably. I can't wait until this game is developed more because I've already had so much fun!

Drop-in drop-out co-op is great fun.There are three things that could be improved:(1) the mosquito is next to impossible to shoot with pistols and hand bows.(2) The sub-levels within a stage look very similar and seem a little repetitive.

,Recommended,551700,34703449,Posted: 2 September,all,Shadow,"A supreme, social, shooter with a super community.https://youtu.be/QM7JDtZG6cMIn a lot of ways, Gunheart reminds me of Warframe. From the random money cases you find along the ground to the appearance customization option to the enemy models themselves. I get so Warframe deja vu feelings.Not quite strong enough to say it's Warframe in VR but more like I see similar gameplay elements.Locomotion options galore! These guys got locomotion right. The only thing I'd want is a jump option but that's nitpickey. You can choose from HMD or controller oriented, trackpad or teleport, press the trackpad or just touch, comfort blinders or not.... and more. They nailed locomotion options and more devs should learn from their example.The ""AR in VR"" thing that they have going on with their UI is really nice. Some of the AR crosshairs remind me of the anime Nanoha. Especially the bow... It works really well for giving you the feeling of being in a visor.Where the UI fails is that it places things too far to the outside of the FOV. There are several instances where I could not see all the text popping up on screen or UI elements like the shield meter. It's pretty minor in the grand scheme of things but I wish they were more confined to the center of your view. It's a delicate thing to get right.Content...There's a large variety of weapons to unlock and each one has 2-3 upgrades you can purchase. You have 25 levels worth of upgrades on your character.There seems to be 4 levels worth of story content each having 4 missions of varying types for a total of 16 static missions. There is also a  PvP Brawl mode which I never found anyone to fight. Finally there is a rotating weekly set of missions.This game will likely keep you busy for a while. Oh, did I mention there are elite levels that change not only the difficulty of the mobs but the type of mobs that spawn? %&#@$^ kamikaze hatchlings...The characters and storyline have a vague Borderlands feel to them IMO. Also not a bad thing. Hopefully it continues in the further missions. It no AAA quality story but I'm still interested in seeing where it goes.The community that I've seen thus far has been very welcoming and helpful. They're quick to offer tips and help or just someone to goof off in the social area and there are plenty of people coming and going in the social hub if you hang out in there for any period of time.The whole reason I left in my derp at the start of the video was to show the community's willingness to help out.Complaints... Speaking of the tutorial, it's bugged to hell. The first taste of the game shouldn't be such a pain point. It would not go past the very first steps no matter what I did. The farthest I was able to get was the third step but I was never able to go past that. The tutorial would refuse to acknowledge the fact that I was doing what it was asking.That's pretty much it as far as complaints go. There's the standard no quit button complaint but that's about where it ends."

This game is a shooter where you travel through different levels or defend an objective, it is one of the best made games to date on the Vive, especially for how it is set up.  You cannot predict the fights or where enemies will spawn, it is not the same even if you play the same level over and over.There is a brief tutorial, but some things are left out, although if you look in the opening area the things it misses are still there posted on the wall.Anyone who loves shooters will likely enjoy this game.  Right now as the game is still fairly new there are still a few bugs you see ocasionally, such as enemies randomly teleporting or getting stuck in walls.You get more options as you play more in the game, run missions get money to buy upgrades, that is what this game is essentially about.  At this point I would highly recommend this game, and if they start adding more content later even more so, such as more upgrades when players are further along, no one likes to hit a cap and get stuck, but being new this is to be expected.I am not a fan of upgrade systems like this, but I would easily say this is the best game currently available for the vive, especially if you are into shooters."

76561198295539757,Recommended,551700,33940645,Posted: 31 July,all,Master jedikid,"Played on: Oculus Rift(Updated Review after some thought)Major Issue (FOR ME): Oculus Rift secondary trigger buttons are used to pull out a multi-tool, so I am constantly pulling the multi-tool out when trying to fire the weapons. Other games use the secondary triggers for holding a weapon. When I try to play the game I have to hold the weight of the controllers in my last two fingers, rest my pointers on the triggers and hover my middle fingers over the secondary triggers. It cramps my fingers and tweaks my wrists. It may not be as uncomfortable for others but for me it breaks the game and it's uncomfortable to actually play. Vive owners and others might not have this issue and enjoy the game.So as not to bring up a problem without a solution, I would love to see the devs change the multi-tool to be equipped when the second trigger is released not when pressed, and equip guns when it's pressed, or add a setting in the options to allow us to toggle this.This again, may not be an issue for others, but for me it ruins the game, as I can not play it comfortably. Note: I WANT to play the game, its fun and looks promising, its what kind of game VR needs.Pros:- Graphics, models, and level design looks great.- Gunplay felt good, ignoring my controller issues- I love the idea of having an option for teleport and strafing, would love to see free rotate with joystick option(Smooth rotate or whatever its called).- Like the progression and upgrade system.Cons:- Long loading screens, but honestly not too bad.- Encountered a lot of rushing players in my missions that horded all the cash canisters, did not care about playing just collecting those.- (As mentioned in pros) No option for free rotation with joy stick. I have a small amount of space and prefer to control rotate in faster paced games as I don't get motion sickness. I never got use to using teleportation in a pinch and always ended up with my back to the enemies.I was frustrated by the issues with the secondary triggers, it doesn't seem intuitive for the Rift, and when I wanted to play the game, I've been looking forward to purchasing it when it was released to EA, I got disappointed that it was really the only thing that stopped me from playing and broke the game for me. That being said, if it was fixed I would play the game in a heartbeat, so I guess I shouldn't give it a bad review. Just sucks I can't enjoy it."

We all know that an EA title is expected to be buggy or missing features as it develops, and Gunheart is no different.Gunheart takes a solid premise of coop based mini campaigns in which you fight off hordes of aliens, all while leveling, looting, and getting that sweet sweet money for upgrades.There is a lot of promise to this game and the dev's are extremely active in Discord and Reddit. It may not be polished at the moment, but this has a lot of potential to be a solid VR shoot em up with RPG elements."

Most noticeable with the Bow.you tilt your controls/guns towards each other to combine them thus giving you your chaingun, bow, rocket launcher what ever you have as your combined weapon.. but in doing so its a pain to get out of it consistantly enough... nice idea but what happend to just pulling out pistols from your hip? or your heavy weapon from your back... over complicated a simple thing such as weapon switching.. ruins the pace of close fast firefights.Teleporting also has its issues with controls not always being detected, having to press multiple times or aim else where to get it to show up to be able to teleport.The Aiming of pistols also felt off center, not sure if that is just me being spoilt or just to used to Raw Data or other games like it, aiming at something always felt like i had to aim slightly higher.Level Design is very simple but thats fine plenty of verticality to combat areas.Graphics are not bad (on ultra)Text is very legiblePerformance is great (on i7 6700k + GTX 1080)Weapon Sounds feel Lacking any real punchOver abundance of Russians...

,Recommended,551700,35028903,Posted: 17 September,all,AltitudeVR,"Buy this game.We've been getting to know Gunheart for a couple of weeks now, and have really been enjoying the ride.  First-things-first, as we write this review, this title is in early access.  It's not perfect.  There are bugs (and not just the extra-terrestrial insects that seek to blow your head off in-game).  Sometimes it freezes, sometimes it crashes.  Sometimes the enemy AI makes them just stand there and stare at you as you shower death from every corner of the periodic table of elements into their buggy little face(s).Having said all that, it's still awesome.  When it works (and most of the time, it does) it works really well.  Gun handling, while not entirely realistic - and why would it be - is super fun and satisfying (try a pair of upgraded pistols; imagine the reanimated head of John Woo directing a reboot of ""Starship Troopers"" set 600 years in the future).So far, the community of Gunheart players is a good one.  Everyone we've met playing in early access really seems to want to help the game succeed.  Haven't come across too many Negative Nellies to date.  There is a lot of emphasis on teammates helping teammates; it's downright tough to clear some of these levels on your own.Just a couple things we'd like to see:- More levels!!! (duh)- More physics-based, damage-specific enemy deaths. When I shoot a bug in the face with the sniper rifle, I'd like to see it die a noticeably different death than when I shred its wicked little carapace with the chaingun.  Ditto the shotgun, bow, mines, rockets, etc.  Some good-natured dismemberment would be nice... just sayin'. Currently, the animations can seem a bit... canned... at times.- This may border on greed, but... I'll just say it: more weaponry!  There is a nice little arsenal to start with, but we want more!  MORE!!!- Various bug fixes, which the devs are already all over, no doubt.Fingers-crossed that these things are on the way.Really impressed so far with most aspects of the enemy AI, when it is working (which, again, is the vast majority of the time).  They seek cover fairly realistically, try to flank you, snipe you, frag you, etc.  It generally feels like you are in a realistic firefight (to the extent that 6 foot tall insectoids carrying laser rifles can impart realism).Bottom line:  This game is fun to play, and makes you want to keep playing it.  It's already nicely polished, and has gotten even better with the handful of updates so far.  We come back to Gunheart several times  a week and are really looking forward to seeing what comes next."

There is almost an identity crisis going on where the game feels alot like Overkill VR with its static nature (you can teleport to moving platforms only to have them stop in mid air once you are on them), the set piece battles are not that satisfying compared to Overkill however.The more horde like sections where you need to move about feel more like Raw Data, but are more immersion shattering since being able to instantly blink hundreds of meters above the action feels like a cheat code rather then a game mechanic.The guns have aiming crosshairs that for some reason feel more like you are dragging the crosshairs around rather then aiming and firing on the go and the gun sounds are very underwhelming.I loved the concept and art direction as well as the mission based structure, but the gameplay failed to excite me.The game is in early access so hopefully this will change down the road, but currently paying 35$ to play intergalctic wack a mole is a bit much in my opinion."

It provides some simple character progression, and being able to play with friends is a nice feature.  I could see this game being an enjoyable ARPG down the road, but it feels a little more like Hellgate: London than Diablo II/III right now.  There's a concept and reasonable execution at the moment, but there's a good bit of refinement lacking in a lot of areas.My biggest gripes at the moment are as follows.  The animations for just about everything could use a ton of work.  The developers have made some minor improvements in this area, but I still feel like Im shooting Doom II sprites most of the time.  Also, the level design doesn't get interesting up until the 4th act, and the game generally feels a little empty.  On the other hand, some of the more frantic fights can be somewhat fun due to the volume of enemies attacking you.  It's just a shame that the enemies aren't smarter; the AI feels pretty shallow.  Finally, the game just doesn't really give me any reason to care about its universe.  I find this to be a strange problem to have in a VR game.  I don't know if it's a theme issue, the fact that there's literally no characters to interact with, or that there's no loot system, but there's something definitely missing here.  There's a lot of potential here that falls short of a compelling experience.This game, as it sits at the time of this review, seems like a decent game to support in the current EA VR space, but it really does have a long way to go before I'd encourage people to buy it."

This was really horrible and not intuitive, especially when you're in battle, cause it's hard to both move and shoot while fighting with one hand. So please, make it like the game ""serious Sam vr the first encounter"" where if you just TOUCH (not press) the touchpad on the edge you run. The closer you put your thumb to the edge of the touchpad, the faster you run. So that would also elimiate the need for pressing the touchpad twice.2-there was a 1 second delay in shooting guns/slingshots, hope this'll get fixed.3-you can't jump between platforms, you HAVE to teleport. Is it possible to add a jump button by pressing the ""grip"" button on the vive or something? That would be amazing.4- is there a way to know your own health? Cause I died without knowing how much health I even had. If there isn't, could you add like a watch on the wrist so we can check?That's it really, most important thing are these. Especially removing the need to press the touchpad to move, only touching it would be enough to move. And touching it at the edge makes you run fast.5-changing the supersampling wasn't doing anything. I had the in game resolution on the highest settings, but it was still not crisp.

My review loose positive for over emphasising coop (see below and comments).Pros:* Locomotion is spot on.* Weapons, upgrades, and progression feels natural.* Models and enviroment are nice.* Player customization is fairly complete.Cons:* Some minor framerate slowdowns when there is a lot of activity/destruction.* Over emphasis on coop match. This is my major gripe with the game so far. When you try to start a level outside a group the game tries to join an existing match by default. If there are no open slots it then kicks you back to a usually empty social lobby. I thought this was a bug at first until I realized what was happening and when I did, there was noone to group with.* PvP is not balancedl. Player upgrades appear to carry over into PvP matches.* Tutorial went away after relaunching the game several times due to previous bugs and/or server issues. There is no way for me to finish the tutorial if I wanted to.What's Needed:* A LFG button/menu - massing invites is not very effective.* PvP balance - give players selectable loadouts. Either that or an ELO system ,but that is really dependant on the overall populationI do have mild concerns on the overall amount of content in the game, but that is too early to tell."
