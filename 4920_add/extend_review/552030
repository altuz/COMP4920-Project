,Not Recommended,552030,29051373,Posted: 5 January,all,DeadPoolX,"NOTE: Artillerists was originally a free mobile game with in-app purchases. The version on Steam costs money to buy, but is the full product.PROS:+ It's basically the classic game, Battleship, but on land using artillery pieces instead of naval warships+ Easy to pick up and play+ No time commitment+ The developer is willing to listen to feedback and adjust the game+ There's an upgrade system where you can acquire new units, more units, and extra weaponry+ It's cheap at $3.99 USDCONS:- It's basically Battleship... which means there's very little to see here that's even remotely new- Poor graphics that look slightly better than the original Tropico (which came out in 2001)- Skirmish Mode is locked by default until the player has completed the entire campaign- Money is hard to get so you'll always be at a disadvantage (in terms of unit numbers and power) against the AI- The campaign is full of unnecessarily long still-frame cutscenes that must be watched every time you play- Dialogue is badly written (likely the result of poor Russian-to-English translation) and the attempts at humor are cringe-inducing, especially the female reporter who appears out of nowhere to make comments about her hair- Single player only- No Steam CloudRECOMMENDATION: Unless there are some major changes to the game, I can't recommend Artillerists. It's not a terrible game (I've certainly played worse), but that's not exactly a ringing endorsement. I'd suggest skipping Artillerists unless you're so desperate for a Battleship-like game that you're willing to overlook this game's faults.The only reason I even bought it was because I like Battleship and this game is on sale for 25% off its already very low price tag. Losing $2.99 USD (or in my case, $3.36 CAD) is hardly a major ordeal and not enough for me to request a refund."

Yes, it's a bit tedious for most people and yes... it's essentially a clone of Battleship.  With slightly more turn-based strategy as you progress.  I think the AI is just right for this game (not incredibly smart / cheating), so that makes it a bit easier to win.Mutliple reviewers are saying the enemy's location is up to a complete guess.  When I first started playing I also believed this to be true.  However, this is not true once you learn more of the gameplay and proceed further into the missions.  Here are some tips for those struggling (because I didn't realize these are first either):1. The enemy's long artillery are only oriented in one direction (facing you).  So don't be trying to find pieces oriented in the other direction.2. Pay attention to indicators on the ground if you miss a shot.  If there was a red radar-like indicator, it means the enemy has a unit on a nearby square.  This can be likened to Minesweeper.3. You earn money faster as you progress through the missions (the bonus missions help too), so it's not as bleak as when you first start out.4. Use your weapon upgrades wisely.  IMO better to have more weapon abilities & shots per turn than pieces on your board.To conclude, I think this is a fine turn-based war game for the $4 price tag.  But I completely understand how it would be boring for most people."

There's radar and there's airstrikes and there's a little bit of a Freecell aspect, but it has all the random guessing excitement of Battleship. It's certainly not some sort of military strategy game."
,Recommended,552030,28952913,Posted: 2 January,all,jsh1138,"This game is basically exactly like Battleship, but with artillery instead of navy ships. You set up your artillery and then take turns bombarding an area looking for the enemy artillery while they look for yours.You can use radar or airstrikes or whatever to help out, but basically that's the game. Its pretty fun and at this price worth getting."

Actually had a game where I had more clicks shutting off dialog than firing projectiles.Also way unbalanced 6 units vs 2 early on with the enemy having multiple hit artillery. Very irritating.Just looking for a solitare replacement.I usually revisit before I comment but this game really sucks.

And while there's no microtransactions or anything, the AI is clearly a cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that always knows where your units are. Winning soon becomes an exercise not just in luck (which is fine) but in futility. Even as a cheapo title, this isn't worth your time."

,Recommended,552030,29438434,Posted: 22 January,all,twitch.tv/sign88,"WHAT IS Artillerists:Artillerists is like playing Battleships, just without the ships. It's a single player game but the story/campaign isn't really a thing. You will be able to play Skirmish after you completely finishes the campaign mode.You get money for every finished mission to buy upgrades and consumeables.PROs:- Battleship like gameplay- Easy to learn- small game / not time consumingCONs:- Campaign- Single player only- Cant replay missions (if you have a 3star rating)To summon it up:You get what you expect. A battleship like game with small graphics. It's ok  when you have some time to kill and dont have anything else to do. But you wont find yourself playing hours and hours. Grab it when it is on sale!"

If you shoot first you end your round.Recommended."

Its got a great price and probably is worth more so in my opinion is if you want your battleship fix then its a no brainer.Its not just pick your locations and attack enemy locations you have the ability to buy extra troops, better troups and even have things like radar and air strikes which can be upgraded. its pritty good.I only have two gripes so far and that is I cant replay missions once i win them(who knows might unlock later) and the animation of back and forth and firing gets boring when you keep missing for 15+ hits. but when u get a hit its exciting.Its a good game for a great price and lots of fun. can you ask for anything else?"

76561198116527414,Recommended,552030,29095554,Posted: 7 January,all,Sigmar,"Artillerists is an army-themed version of the classic Battleships. It belongs to the type of casual game I like to play in a small window while watching TV series online. The campaign is not difficult, and I did not experience the balancing issues other reviewers reported. However, it is challenging enough to keep you interested, you cannot just rush through without updating your arsenal, or you will face defeat. Also, the feature that your shots are attack and recon at the same time (you get a short red signal when enemy artillery pieces stand in a square adjacent to the one you hit) makes you pay attention and even use your memory and logical thinking when you decide where to strike next into the ""fog of war"", in a way that feels a little bit familiar from Minesweeper.I am satisfied with the graphics and the explosions. Just the dialogues between NPCs during the battles should be cut out: They are generic, repetitive, inconsequential for the gameplay and not as funny as the developer probably thinks they are.This is just a minor disturbance though, and considering the low price, I can give this little game a ""thumbs up""recommendation in good conscience."

Extremly satisfying despite repetitious gameplay. (My favorites are ""narrative missions"" with preselected forces and conditions.) Also, game symbolically represents the russian military philosophy, because ""artillery is the god of war"". And (spoiler), it has a pacifistic message at the end of the campaign.  Do recommend."

There are several problems with this game.-The AI is completely BS! I've been stuck on the final ""misssion"" for at least a combined total of 5 hours. Considering that's half the time I've had the game (at the time of this review), it's absolute garbage how the AI can pinpoint your units.-The dialogue is terrible. I'm not sure if something got lost in the Russian-to-English translations, or if it's just poor writing. The worst part is that there is no way to skip the dialogue entirely; one can only click rapidly to dismiss it.-The ""campaign"" makes no sense. Why there's any story involved is a mystery to me.-In order to play ""Skirmish"" mode (for just a quick match) you have to suffer through the campaign.At least it's only $3.99. I would place this game in the same realm as Solitaire or Freecell. It's an OK way of killing a few minutes before moving on to something important."
