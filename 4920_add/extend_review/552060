It's longer than any other escape game I've played here (it's actually 3 interconnected rooms), and the general visual quality is a pretty nice change from previous escape games; it's the first VR escape game I've played that felt like a finished product, and not a hobby project made by one guy. The title seems to imply that it's the first entry in a potential series, so hopefully they keep going with it."

Loved doing it with my friends and any time I see an Escape Room VR game I have to get it.This is probably the best one out of the group I've tried in VR!GET IT!

It's not long, but I was entertained throughout the experience and the quality is quite good. The puzzles were not too difficult or annoying (it's one thing to have the player wondering while sitting comfortably, but it's different if he's standing with added weight to the head).All in all a fun game absolutely worth 10$/€."

,Recommended,552060,29078138,Posted: 6 January,all,Geos,I think this is the best VR room escape game i have tried! It does a great job of capturing the spirit of the classic internet browser genre. I look forward to seeing what the dev creates next.

Like most in the genre, the physics are a bit rough, but the manipulation of objects is much smoother than most, and the highlighting really helps encourage the exploration that makes these games fun."

,Recommended,552060,29176707,Posted: 10 January,all,Baysyde,I absolutely loved this game.  A lot of objects to play with and that surprise ending caught me off guard.  I really need to get back into this game one day to try to find everything.  I'm not sure it's worth $12 but if you see it on sale then please jump on it!This video contains spoilers but if you're interested in seeing my experience with this game then feel free to check out the vid below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGeUwRB_IWc

The thing now is that it's short.The fuse was the hardest part to find for me and that extended my time with about 15 minutes.Great job on the game never the less, but extending it would be great!"

,Recommended,552060,27931822,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,gamefreak113,"The game is short but fun. The general solution is fairly obvious but I cannot figure out the notepad in the first room for the life of me. I guess that would be the 'second' exit, but no matter which item I investigate, I cannot find a suitable solution.The first 2 rooms are nice and the third 'room' feels a bit rushed. During this 'room' I did not have the feeling of 'Hmm, what should I do here?'. I figured it out the moment I set foot in the 'room' but it just took some time.Nevertheless a nice Escape Room game for VR, a bit better than the rest of 'em."

76561198384657766,Recommended,552060,33128830,Posted: 2 July,all,Rufus,I loved this game.  So far this is my favorite escape the room game.  Easily forgot I was in my living room and found myself avoiding tables and items in the game as if they were real.  Its short but sweet.  For that reason do not look up any walkthroughs!   Save the satisfaction for yourself!!  Also this was a good intro to VR game.  My aunt said she would just take a look for a minute.  She ended up playing this for over a half hour.  As a non-gamer everything in this came naturally to her.

The puzzles aren't overly difficult, but like somebody else mentioned, there are a lot of useless objects that act as distraction.  There are hints available in case you get stuck, but if you really looked through everything around you, the solution should be obvious.   Worth the purchase price."
