76561198043352384,Recommended,552080,30494911,Posted: 13 March,all,Verdauga,"Disclaimer - Beta tester.Main things that I like.- There's a rare incentive to NOT die in games. In IronWolf VR, drowning is quite a visceral experience, especially when the water slowly creeps up from your knees, waist, chest, and then you're on your tip toes trying to keep your head above water. This makes me actively try very hard to avoid dying.- Multi-player makes the experience truly better than playing solo. Shouting bearings of targets, depths while trying to avoid depth charges actually makes it a viable 2-3 player game. This is really giving me a good idea of what I'm expecting from StarTrek Bridge Crew (assuming that each role has active roles).- I'm bored of wave based shooters, and it's a huge relief to flip switches and turn dials and plan my tactics, rather than trying to aim a pistol/rifle/bow+arrow at monsters."

,Recommended,552080,30500910,Posted: 13 March,all,Scooter,"I never really liked submarine games that much, but this game definitivly changed my mind. At singleplayer it's an ok game, but it really shines when you're 3-4 players. It's a team game with several stations that one can man and communication is the key. Some of the stations are periscope with target lock, sonar, torpedos, depth, speed and bearing etc. It may sound complicated, but it only takes one game to learn, but becoming good at it can take more.This game is not only fun, it's also terror. When that destroyer detects you and you can see it coming closer and closer on the radar, eventually getting on top of you and dropping explosives, I like to think I felt some of the terror people on a submarine must have felt. The silence when you're trying to hide from it, the fear when you hear it dropping explosive barrels on you and the terror when they explode and water is flooding into your submarine.Game consists of 6 missions and 3 difficulties in early access. I have yet to encounter any bugs, and for a early access title it seems very polished.I've bought my fair share of VR games and to be honest there's only a few VR games I really liked and felt was worth the money. There's no doubt that this is one of them. It can only get better from here: Great job devs!My specs: i7 6700k, 980ti, 16gb ram, ran smoothly at 1.4 SS"

Congratulations !One aspect I think needs to be improved/added is a ballast pump. Diesel boats dont just use air and flooding.A great improvement would be to add thermoclines. Subs try to find the best depth where the differenec in salinity and temperature is locacted to hide under it when they are being searched by active sonar.Finally, you could add ESM (electromagnetic search to get an early warning when airplanes or helicopters are searching for you or to located enemy ships emitting. Please make it noticeable when teh periscope is up or downI really like the game, congrats and keep making it as close to reality as possible"
,Recommended,552080,30628357,Posted: 19 March,all,@Dicky Spanish,"Many years ago as a young lad I used to sit on a Saturday afternoon and watch the war movie they showed on TV. It was the highlight of my week and my favourite ones were the naval battles and especially the sub movies. This led to playing games like silent hunter be my favourite when I got my first real computer in the 90s.Anyway enough of my reminiscing and back to the game at hand. While limited missions, early access like most other VR games. This is a fantastic game and what VR is about. Great use of roomscale, great looking graphics and a lot of fun.I have not played the co-op part yet but actually enjoying single player enough not to worry about it. The missions are simple atm but shows what could be. You actually feel fear when you see a destroyer start to hunt you and as you dive deep anxiety grips waiting for the sound of depth chargers being released.As they explode and your sub starts to flood you see the water rising and feel the hopelessness as there is nothing you can do.Anyway waiting for more content and if it comes could be the best game on the vive. It's just so suited to VR.There is much needed like binoculars in the tower and a deck gun not just anti aircraft would be good. Sneaking into ports and access to other areas of the sub.Just Don't fart while playing the smell just seems to hang around for ages."

I never felt overwhelmed by controlling the submarine playing by myself. Though having another player with you would probably make a world of difference.The feeling of being inside the sub and then heading to periscope depth to look around on the surface is wonderful.When I was surfaced for a time I took a few hits from a plane, the sub very quickly begun to take on water. I panicked a little bit as the water went up and over my waist!Unfortunately at the time of playing there were no other players on any other server. I'll wait for the weekend to see if there are others online. Hopefully oculus support will be added in the future, that would bump up the player numbers.I think the game would benefit from having a few more submarine classesthough , and perhaps even being able to man a destroyer and hunt submarines. Maybe a 2 vs 2 online match or something like that, to add some more depth.All being said, I'm excited for the future of this game.Get it if you love Sub sims."

,Recommended,552080,30994048,Posted: 7 April,all,spacegazelle,"I think this is my first Steam review but I may have done one drunk. Felt compelled to tell anyone who's thinking of buying what a great game this is, especially with a friend. Designed around minimum roomscale requirements and not requiring point and click teleporting makes a huge difference to the immersion. There's no faff, once the headset is on you never need to recentre yourself within the play area or look for chaperone because the walls of the room do it for you. It's quite liberating and one is left to concentrate on how uncomfy the headset is getting because you've been playing it with a friend for two hours solidly.And it really is great in two player co-op. It's initially disconcerting to have a friend up that close in a confined environment and I briefly worried I stank of booze, having had a glass or two before playing, but it soon becomes second nature and besides you're too busy working as a team. And that's when it becomes the most immersive game I've tried in VR, and I've tried a few.One man on periscope duties and the other steering, or maybe one is on deck shooting the planes and the other is firing off torpedoes. Maybe you're both just staring at the radar and having a chat about what to do next. It's very easy to forget you're not there.The big question is will this have legs? The levels lack variety at the moment and the end of the day there's only so much you can do with torpedeos and a gun up top. I know they're adding another room so we'll see how that pans out but I would recommend this without hesitation if you have someone to play it with. The best experience I've had in VR to date.And special mention goes to those water effects."

It looks pretty good, though a bit cramped even for a sub, and lacking in AI crew.However, it still needs work to match the current standards in sub sims:1. Periscope should show relative bearing, not just magnetic bearing.2. We need binoculars.  Modt night attacks were conducted from the conning tower using binoculars.3.  The sub needs a proper plotting table, to be able to mark the course of any moving objects.4.  We need a deck gun.  Many merchantmen were sunk by gunnery from submarines.5.  Torpedoes weren't instant kill weapons unless a warship's magazine blew up.  It took time to sink a ship, sometimes hours.  The way these ships sink is too arcadey.6. We need decoys and to be able to launch oil and debris to throw off persistent escorts.7. Pattern running torpedoes and sound-seeking torpedos, as well as sstraight-running steam and electric torpedoes.8. Torpedo depth settings and magnetic influence detonators so we have the choice of direct impact or a detonation beneath the keel"

76561197977727912,Recommended,552080,30520555,Posted: 14 March,all,Finnos,"Although it is a bit rough around the edges, as should be expected of an early access game, IronWolf VR captures the feeling of being in a submarine very well. It's tight and claustrophobic. The gameplay is also quite good and really shines in multiplayer.You interact with the vessel by turning weels, twisting knobs and flipping switches. It feels like you are operating the equipment of a real submarine. All the controls are available to all the players, you are not fixed in a specific role. Its up to the players (max 4) to divide up the work between yourselves. In a game I played yesterday, one manned the rudder, hydroplane (makes the boat go up or down), and ballast tanks. One was on the hydrophone (passive sonar) and one person manned the periscope.We were fighting a destroyer, and during the fight we switched roles freely simply by walking up to a different set of controls. It is also possible to collaborate. For example, the person on the periscope aimed the torpedoes and then I fired them by flipping the torpedo fire switches. Its not pusing a button four times on a keyboard, you are actually flipping the switches on the torpedo fire computer.I played several games and really had a blast. Although it is very early days and the game is not without faults, it is great fun to play already now. I experienced a couple of crashes, but overall it was stable."

76561198039944870,Recommended,552080,30562832,Posted: 16 March,all,Wheatley,"As soon as I saw roomscale submarine, I bought it as did my friend on my rec. We were surprised with the competent and relatively complete game we were presented with, considering the travesty of most early access titles, not to mention VR titles. The current sub is small, two rooms, but their aweesome room traversal method means the number rooms could be basically unlimited. As you leave one room, it flips you so you're facing the door, with your whole play area behind you, meaning you can now walk through that room. The graphics are nice, the skybox is actually really great imo and it's really easy to pick up.As we played, we reminisced about Silent Hunter and hoped the devs would take this all the way. After reading their early access plan, we are not disappointed! Basically everything we noticed was missing is planned for the game, and from my point of view, isn't too far fetched. It doesn't feel like the dev is reaching, trying to make unrealistic goals to sell the game early. If you like Silent Hunter and have a vive and a friend or two, grab this to support the development. But be aware, it's not quite historically accurate yet, you're not in a full uboat and the devs are going for intuitive gameplay over pure simulation like SH5. I don't mind this. I'd love to see them tackle historically accurate subs eventually, but if not, it's fun enough to let it slide. This is a shining example of one of the few games that is close to, and appears to be growing into a full VR title. (Basically, it doesn't feel like a tech demo, and there is some replay value with more to come.)"

It's a fantastic multiplayer game, as everyone  has to work together and it really does a great job immersing you in the environment.  Big thumbs up, highly recommended, totally worth every penny!"
76561197970649657,Recommended,552080,33951009,Posted: 1 August,all,Cownan,"9.5/10 with room for improvement and updates.A fantastic co-op simulator game with very nice atmosphere and graphics.Really get the feel of being a crew member.Up to 4 players can join different rooms/positions in the u-boat.Works OK with minimum roomscale of 1.5x2.0mTook some time to get the hang of all the controls and equipment.But with ""learning by doing"" we finally figured everything out.Skipped most of the tutorial/manual and the experience was really really fun.Personally recommend to shut off AI help (alarm, reloading and position) when playing with friends.Some examples of the stations:* Torpedoe roomLoading torpedoes by hand. Can get intense in the heat of battle and is most fun, butexhausting.Tip: Don´t forget to reset levers and empty water in tubes before reloading :)Torpedoes can also be fired from this room but you can´t target enemy ships from here.Best solution is to ""Lock target with periscope"" let the computer calculate and then fire.* Control/Engine roomThe heart of the u-boat.Check map, speed, heading, depth gauges, activate alarms and much much more.Diving to different depths to mask your engine sound, avoid detection and sneak up on the enemy.Get up to periscope level and fire away.Tip: When running deep/silent  watch depth instrument to avoid hitting the sea bottom,When below surface, try stay clear of underwater mines marked with X on radar on some missions.Solid ring on the 360 degree map indicates how much noice your sub gives away, Adjust depth and engine speed to getas close you can to the enemy. Especially during the Battleship mission.Engine sound is lower the deeper you go. You can only do 6 knots at full speed below sea level,* Deck (Obviously only usable when on the water surface)Shoot down incoming planes with the deck cannon.Check the horizon for enemies.Hopefully they´ll update the game so you can also  use binoculars.Tip: If you miss and the plane get to close to you, stop firing and let it pass, fire again when itpasses.When shooting planes in close range the parts will often crash into your sub and sink it,* Periscope roomUse of hydrophone to locate enemy engine sounds and get positions.Use of periscope with the help of target computer and fire control.Remember that torpedoes can be fired both from the torpedoe room and periscope room.So if you want the torpedo guy work even more, lock target and tell him/her fire from there.Will probably go faster to fire but with reduced reload time.Levers on the side of perscope is used for raising/lowering and  also zooming.Tip: Remeber to ""Lock target"" after each torpedoe is fired."

I like sub games, they're lots of fun, and I've always enjoyed the Silent Hunter games (I played a lot of SH3 without Steam), but I guess it wasn't the first thing I thought of when I bought my Vive.This however, is absolutely fantastic. Not only does it recreate the thrill of being in a submarine, it really captures the main bits that you might expect (periscope, basic navigation controls + depth controls, torpedo firing), bearing in mind it's early access. It's also worth pointing out with regards to that - the devs have put up a clear roadmap on Trello that people can vote for. It's not something that happens that often, and it's worth pointing out that they have clear ideas on how to improve the game, and are prioritizing them based on users.So...Pros----Looks gorgeous, captures the aesthetic perfectlyCovers the essentialsDev has a clear roadmap going forwardYou can drown, and it's pretty horribleIt already has enough content to keep you occupied for a fair while (couple hours on single player missions I guess, and some time doing co-op)Cons-----It desperately needs more variety of combatIt could do with a similar campaign to SH with a persistent worldComing from Silent Hunter games, you can see the areas that it could really do with in terms of navigation, firing solutions and sub control (although obviously this has to be done carefully to allow a single player to manage it)Summary---------Definitely get this if you have any interest whatsoever in piloting a sub, it's under active development, and the devs seem to know what they're doing. This is so far in the top 3 of VR games as far as immersion goes for me (because the environment is so perfect I think)."

This is a great start for Early Access and I get the feeling this sim will have a long and succesful life. The immersion is fantastic. I encourgae the developers, as they progress, not to be too easy on us. The act of fighting and surviving in a submarine was not easy so please keep realism in mind as you continue to add features and depth. I think many of us would get more satisfaction from skillfully and purposefully sinking one ship than easily and quickly sinking a convoy. Keep up the good work.

I've played missions alone, but the game really comes alive with more crew members; each taking on a specific role with communication and coordination the key to success!Being early release there are a few very excusable bugs...the game drops out occasionally, but a whole-game restart seems to do the trick and make it run smooth as a Type XXI gliding across a calm and benevolant sea.

Talking through your actions, describing where your heading next, confirming instrument read outs, truly excellent.I wish some more info was available during training - if the devs could add a tool-tip style overlay in the training for each of the many levers it would be much appreciated.They've put in just enough arcade (sonar display, guided torpedos) to keep the play from being bogged in simulation, but there's also enough opportunity for ""happy"" accidents (like opening a torpedo tube while flooding them and being waste deep in water) to keep it from feeling cheesy.I would be very interested in throwing down $$ for new head models as a DLC.

It is in EA at the moment, but it's already a VERY polished game and I haven't experienced any bugs or issues. It is lacking in content at the moment, but it is EA after all. It has 6 missions. Each getting a bit more difficult than the previous mission. Getting depth charged by a destroyer is nerve wracking. The game has great use of roomscale. A submarine naturally has limited space so it's perfect for VR and room scale. Also, the method they use to go from one room to another makes it possible to have an infinite amount of rooms.It now needs: (Some of this is already planned by the devs)-Periscope bearing FIXED! When I have it on 0 degrees, it should be lined up with the subs bow.-Stern/Aft torpedoes.-A deck gun.-Sights on the AA gun and deck gun.-More rooms on the sub.-Binoculars.-Hopefully the sub in the end will be a U-Boat VII haha-A crew for singleplayer. (Would be nice to assign men to their battle stations like the guns on deck/maintenance/etc. like on SIlent Hunter. Even if the player can't ""physically see"" the crew.-Night missions/gameplay.-Weather system.-Lights fixed. The red light is for when operating at night time.-Most of all, an open world Campaign where I can take my sub and head out to sea with day/night cycles and random weather/storms.

The sensation of being able to freely move around about your submarine is unreal. Because of this immersion you feel 'there' and things like sirens and explosions easily throw you into a panic.So what do you do? Basically you are in a submarine and you hunt down ships, and prevent yourself from being hunted. This game has a lot of stealth elements and the feeling lifting the periscope, locking your target, flipping the switches to launch the torpedos, and then feeling the rumble of the submarine as the missiles rocket out into the water is unlike any other.

It really gives you the feeling of controlling the ship.  Designed specifically for room scale VR there is no teleporting around.  Going through hatches leads you into other parts of the sub or above deck.Also a great game for co-op in VR.

Great tutorial for a quick start and within minutes you'll be pretending you're in The Hunt for Red October. There is simple controls or you can turn off assists and make the game more difficult. Runs perfectly on my set up even with super sampling on (GTX 1080, Intel I7 3770k). Only a handful of missions available right now but that is what early access is for. Looking forward to the future of this game.Would love to see nuclear missles in the future but maybe that's overkill. Also I feel that a little window on the inside of the sub would help with immersion, being able to actually see your sub diving and such while piloting would be great."

Two complaints and a suggestion.1) Game should remember which assists I normally set, so I don't have to remember to uncheck every single time.2) Don't flip my orientation when I switch rooms. It is very disorienting. At least give an option to maintain orientation. ::EDIT:: I didn't really think that through without flipping orrienation I would walk into a wall in real life.3) Add binoculars that you can bring up to the surface. I'm thinking they would hang around the neck."

This is a real VR work of art.imho, there are very few top-quality VR games ( and I own over 100 VR titles) but this is definitely one of them.In terms of quality and immersion (no pun intended), I'd place it up there with Vanishing Realms, although the gameplay and topic are totally different.The graphics are great, especially inside the submarine and the gameplay is challenging on the higher levels but still draws you back for one more go. Looking through a VR periscope while lining up your torpedoes is an experience that just shows the power of VR, and is so much better than playing in a non-VR simulator. I'm using a HTC Vive so can't comment on an Occulus Rift but this game really uses the VR hardware in a new way.Although the game has cooperative multiplayer - I'm currently only playing in Single-Player and I am already addicted. For the £16.99 I paid for it, I think I got a real bargain!If you're a fan of submarine games (such as Silent Hunter 3) just buy it. You'll have no regrets."

,Recommended,552080,30492491,Posted: 13 March,all,RustNeverSleeps,"One  of those experiences that remind you why VR is worth all the cost and fussing.  Some simulation here but the game strives foremost for playability in a VR setting. All the subs controls are handled with grabbing actual wheels, levers, switches.  The potential is here to add a deeper simulation but this really hits the fine line between arcade and full sim (aka hours required to learn to turn the sub).  In fact you can man the sub alone, although it is tougher than hell with a destroyer bearing down on you.  Looking forward to trying multiplayer.10/10 would be glad I will never set foot on a real sub during a naval battle again."

,Not Recommended,552080,34380200,Posted: 20 August,all,epicvillain,"i DO NOT RECOMMEND RIGHT NOW. SO unfinished. It has one single tutorial that covers a single type of mission. Suddeny the ship starts to fill up with water and because i'm not psychic, I had no idea what to do without a tutorial actually telling me how to do it (which there is none) -- so youre just scrambling around trying to push buttons and turn wheels and there is no actuual feedback in the game telling you whats happening. You just die, over and over. The game is a good concept. It has a ton of work to do before charging more than $5 for it. You cant charge full price on a game thats a quarter of the way done -- or anything when its in such early beta. I dont even understand why devs release crap like this. You misunderstand the concept of MVP. You dont release fully featured functionality that cant actually be used because no one knows how to use it. You release small bits with training attached to those bits, then slowly release more and more. MVP is about releasing a small amount of functionality, getting feedback on it, iterating on that, then releasing more. etc. The UI is really bad too. Just feels like a Desktop port (add some sounds or more intuitive interactions that actually feel like it was built for VR). Its not a design or control or concept issue, it appears to be a company decision making issue. And clearly youve missed the point, sorry."

The graphics are good, the gameplay is solid and the idea is awesome. It has six missions and a multiplayer. It could do with a little more depth (ha ha) but it's early access and shows great promise.The feeling of roaming the seas whilst sitting atop the sub is a wonderful thing. what would be great would be a pair of binocluars so you could scout the horizon. Also some scenary would be a nice touch, so the map becomes an actual place - maybe it could be expanded to have a navigation section with varying water deapth etc? or integration into google maps - now that woud be the one!So many areas this could go in and I'm excited to see where the dev takes it.

All the controls are butter smooth and performance even on 1.6ss is great on a 6700k@4.5ghz with an Evga 1080!The torpedo room is scarily lonely, but really accurate! If this is the way VR is going, it's bang on in the right direction!I'm normally into Milsims FPS VR and Flight Sims!  This is the best subsim ever created!For the DEVS.Everything is amazing but I feel the following can be done:1.Better interface for joint MP games.  Very hard to find and join a session.2. More movement of the sub on the surface as its not in sync with waves.3.Maybe a sight on AA gun.4.Ocean chart / map to show position.  Would be good if there was a sea region to explore in MP and to navigate in.5. Definitely a detailed guide / manual.Excellent for early access though!!Buy this game! It's worth the investment!"
76561198022009440,Recommended,552080,34860110,Posted: 10 September,all,Firebird,"One of the best room-scale VR games, because of the overall gameplay concept.Current problem with most VR games is the movement: You either move a few cm for real, or you have to use teleportation/trackpad movement otherwise. It is confusing, it breaks immersion and there's no optimal solution to this.This submarine works completely different: it consists of multiple rooms between which you transfer by opening hatches or doors. Each room has all levers in reachable position even if you can only use a small room for your VR. But it isn't too small either, it is just right. And every room will always be positioned and aligned the same way, so you do not have to fear your real obstacles at all.No worries about movement, no worries about obstacles. This game is ideal for limited room-scale VR. Vehicles!About the game itself? Very immersive, especially when you run away from a destroyer amd prey hat his sonar won't spot you. It is early access, but I'm already happy with the current state and the devs have a nice roadmap of planned features."

And it doesn't really deserve a thumbs down but rather a natural score which is not possible.Being a huge Silent Service fan I'm was stoked to see a submarine sim in VR. I couldn't click buy quick enough on this one. But from that point on it has been a slow spiral down of mixed emotions.Let me start, this game has a lot of atmosphere, giving you a sense of being in a confined space. Sure its not a realistic conning tower, control room or torpedo room. How can it be with VR being first GEN. Putting aside VR short comings, I just can't recommend this as is. I feel like I'm in the yellow submarine rather than ww2 killing machine. No Nav room with out a map to plot your destination. No hunt, this miss the biggest thing I'm feeling is missing. Time scaling until merchant ships spotted or receiving a wire on where a convoy has been spotted. This is what made Silent Service, and it's missing! Picking a mission and your target is on a big round Nav device is not fun for me.Hopefully this game goes in the right direction and EA is heavily supported. In its current form I would only purchase for the future. Still unsure if I'm refunding as I would like to see this go places and I know the developers need to eat ;)"

Couple of points to raise: Would like to see main deck gun added, in addition to current AA gun to engage merchants, slower firing with having to use optics and have the challenge of ranging targets. Also would be good to have a mode where you have to do more work with TDC to ensure torpedo hits rather than just click a switch that goes green and you nearly always hit your mark. Hopefully later the damage modelling will be improved when attacking enemies. Very atmospheric at moment when submerged. Love the torpedo room, great idea."
