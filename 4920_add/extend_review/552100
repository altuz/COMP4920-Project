They just added guns and roles to the beta.They made a game for kids to make cars. We made tanks. They saw what community picked up this game, and they catered to it. Best freakin' buisness strategy I've seen: give the players what they want.Outstanding job guys, really. Thanks for a great game.Sincerely,Mammal Fur"

Whenever I got an opportunity, I ran to the store to buy a Lego set (or I asked my parents kindly.) My fingers were always itchy, I had to build Lego vehicles. When I first discovered this game, I was really happy. Now I can build vehicles that resemble the vehicles I always used to build as a kid, or just go wild and build something else. I love it, I really love this game.The only things I would love to see added in a future version of this game are: an AI system with vehicles driving around the city, some more types/shapes of bricks so you can build even more crazy vehicles and maybe some indicators for your vehicle.For the rest this game is really good, I reccomend it to everyone who likes building Lego vehicles and drive them around."

,Not Recommended,552100,34486243,Posted: 25 August,all,THE MIGHTY SHAVED ANUS,"While I really enjoy playing this game overall and will probably continue to do so I cannot recomend this game.I must point out three huge issues that Need to be adressed before I feel that can happen.1.the structural integrity base level needs to be increased, While watching your creation crumble to bit in a huge pile up is entertaining seeing the same thing happen when trying to do a slow U turn is less then welcomed, I cant stress enough how flimsy and weak everything feels, the slightest touch causing even to most rubust looking things to seemingly turn to custard in front of your eyes, this is NOT fun and holds makes taking advantage of race the race track entierly impossible unless you want to race at a top speed of 20mph.2. the lack of game modes in the games current state is just enough for you to want to try it, but lackluster enough that you will become bored of them very quickly, the racetrack is impossible to use unless you exclusively use the drag strip.zombie survival is a waste of rescorces IMO and could of been time put into improving the actual game, and battle mode contains the same issues as sandbox, that brings be to my final issue.3. The fps guns and military builds kill any chance of doing anything but getting killed regardless of what server you join.currently the only thing that you can expect from playing on a server for any ammount of time is that evenetually it's going to devolve into a war torn wastland of trolls spawnkilling you with the RPG, you can have the biggerst baddest war machine of them all and have to give up and leave because it's nothing compared to an RPG weilding joykiller content to teleport arround the map following you. This sucks all the fun out of the game and thretens to turn away newcommers.I think this game has a lot of potential but untill I see progress on theese issues a cannot recomend spending the monney on it."

Well, now you can!This game is way to nice to look at than it should be, the Unreal engine gives it a lot of depth and the lighting effects are fantastic.Much liking having a bucket of LEGOs, you have an unlimited access to blocks of almost any variety to build what ever you want, as long as you have the patience.When I finally sat down and started in the builder instead of drivinbg one of the many Workshop cars, I found it relativly easy to use. All the nessesary control and colour changes are there as well as an easy menu. It may be a bit tedious, but it's easy, so you can easliy get used to it.I started doing builds and uploading them to the workshop. I now have had several vehicles top the Workshop boards, proving that even I can build great things!Now, there are a few issues.For one, the physics are kinda odd. Things don't like to stop or turn. Or go in a perfect straight line for that matter, either.You will lag out later on if you start using large vehicles, so watch your brick count or stay in single player!Bottom line?RECCOMENDEDLOVE IT"

There are so many cool cars in the workshop and it never gets old watching them crash. I just recently signed up for the Beta and the work that has been put into this game is great.

76561198230080824,Recommended,552100,33775492,Posted: 24 July,all,Flibble Wally,"REVIEW UPDATE: Don't build any vehicles in the beta version of the game! If you then transfer those vehicles back to the normal version of the game, they glitch out, spawning in pieces! Unless you want to lose your sanity, I would highly recommend building vehicles ONLY in the standard version of Brick Rigs, at least until this bug is ironed out. End of review update.Brick Rigs is getting very interesting with recent updates. It's turning into a lot more than just a Lego vehicle builder.Recent additions like infantry combat, a PVP war mode and zombie survival mode makes me hyped to see what the devs have in store next (these features are only in the beta mode, but you can access them by going to Brick Rigs properties via the Steam Library).Great graphics and physics. It has a couple of bugs which need ironing out, such as blocks sending my flying across the map to certain death, but nothing to distract you from what is otherwise a very technologically impressive game. This game runs smoothly, very rarely drops below 60fps for me. Just goes to show how good the Unreal engine is.This game is ideal for feeding my love of cars. I'm currently working on a Lancia Delta Integrale replica. The tools to build vehicles are simple enough that you can construct a functional vehicle in a few minutes, but advanced enough that you can spend hours fettling and tweaking your vehicles to perfection, adjusting things like gearing, suspension, tyre pressure, weight distribution, aerodynamics etc....If you're into vehicle construction or Lego in general, this game is a must. If you don't buy this game now, at least keep an eye on it. Like I said, things are getting interesting...."

Unfortunately, they drove like crap. There doesnt seem to be any way around that because the game has pretty extreme simulation style physics where you slide off the road and can't drive straight at high speeds, and high speeds don't even feel all that fast. No matter the weight or wheel spacing, going fast at all means sliding all over the place. That's simply not fun. I downloaded a few helicopters and planes too. Had to google how to get them flying then it was such a pain to pilot them that I quit messing with fliers altogether. There are some parts in the editor I didnt even care to mess with until there is a tutorial too.I'm really hoping for at least the option for more arcade style fun controls for all vehicle types.Once you make something, there is very little to do with it right now, which means the longevity of the game for most people will likely be a hand full of hours then waiting for several updates before coming back to it.The graphics are really great for this kind of game though and with it having such fun lego-style building, destruction, and weapons for vehicles, I can see this being a lot of fun eventually both against AI and online multiplayer.Lets just hope it isnt one of those that doesnt get far from where it is even 2 or 3 years later."

,Recommended,552100,30027199,Posted: 18 February,all,puff-dwagon,"Definitely an early access game, though with lotsa potential. The controls are somewhat akward, but with a bit of intuition and previous sandbox experience they're easy enough to figure out. Plus, most, if not all controls are displayed as needed dependant on your current situation. The game is obviously filled with bugs, but they will be worked out in time. Anyone even remotely interested in physics sandboxes should purchase this game while it's cheap. Currently it's $15. Once it hits beta/stable the price will understandably double like a few other early access games I've bought. Think of it as an investment."
,Recommended,552100,35031019,Posted: 17 September,all,A Cat in A Box,"Disclaimer:  Clearly the game is in Early Access, keep in mind that this isn't the final product and it's going to have bugs and unfinished features.  Game design also has lots of unforseen consequences and tough choices that will upset someone somewhere always.Review:  For an unfinished game you can already have some fun with it.  I've avoided the vehicle editor because of some funky mouse detection, but just with workshop vehicles and the handful of maps I've already dumped hours into this game.   A get vague spintires vibes off the big trucks, so definitely part of the draw for me are the big vehicles and physics gameplay...My recommendation isn't because I think the game is going to blow people away or that it's a must buy...  My recommendation is coming because I saw the official lego game that was pitched as digital legos... like everyone has been waiting for... and it was crap.Probably around 30 minutes into playing around in the sandbox in this game I said to myself ""Wow, this is everything the lego game wasn't....""  If you like legos not because of the IPs they work with or the colorful shallow cartoony kids game versions, but because they are fun to build with and then drive your creations around while saying ""VROOOOM! VROOM!""  and then crashing them together in a big shower of bricks, this game is for you.  If you like holding down the throttle on a high speed train until the forces are too strong and the wheels blast off and it derails, this game is for you.If you drive your first car into a rock and total the front end and you don't just respawn it but instead hop in a tow truck and have an undeniable urge to tow it all the way back to the garage before you despawn it, this game is for you."

The multiplayer is stable and there are regularly update for bug fixes and more.That`s called a fair and good ""early acces"". I mean it´s just under 20€.I would give the game 10/10 points.

Whether your one for the blocky destruction in the game, or you more suited  for the building category, the game matches your desription. I'm just going to put this out there, If you enjoyed or enjoy legos and driving sim games, this matches both. The controls may be a bit confusing, but they're not bad. I had to turn down my settings for the game, as my computer card is not the best, nor is my laptop. The game may generate lag at times, but overall is fun to enjoy. I do believe 15 dollars is a bit much, rather 10 dollars would be more appropriate. Besides, this game is in Early Access, many of the issues will be fixed. I've played this game for a few hours or so, and I'm not disappointed. The game even has workshop enabled, so if your that person who sometimes doesn't want building to take forever (like me) you can use Thousands of the player creations. I believe this game has it all for me. I highly reccomend this game for anyone who enjoyed legos (or other brick toys) as a child, and for anyone who is interested in driving-sim games. This Doge approves of this product, Frankly it's one of my favourites. I highly reccomend this game."

76561198274976134,Not Recommended,552100,34985464,Posted: 15 September,all,[sneaky],"Even though this game is a great concept,I'm glad I got this while on sale because this would be a complete waste of $15.I know the game is still an early access, but some of the design choices make me wonder what made the developer think that this is passable. So, whats exactly wrong with this game?1. The controls. The controls for cars and trains are fine, nothing spectacular but its your generic wasd. But it tanks, planes, and helicopters that have horrible controls. With tanks you can only control the hull, or the turret. Not both at once. And if you switch to the turret contols while moving, instead of the tank slowly coming to a stop it keeps going and going. Also if you control the turret in 3rd person the camera doesnt follow it, but more on that later. Planes: The center of gravity on planes and helicopters seems to be where the drivers seat is, making flying these things really wonky. When you enter 3rd person the camera doesnt follow the plane, so you constantly have to switch tetween flying and moving the camera if you want to see where your going. I would recommend that the game controls somewhat like War Thunder, because thats tanks and planes done right.2. Strength of vehicles. Everything is so fragile in the game. Lets say your driving through a city in a tank, and your gun barrel accadentally taps the side of a building, well it just falls straight off your tank. Wheels constantly come off while going over rough terrain, and landing planes and choppers is hopeless, you lightly TAP the ground and the whole thing falls apart. There needs to be a way to strengthen vehicles.3. The vehicle creator. I havent messed much with this but from what i've seen, it f*cking sucks. Its way too dificult and poorly optimized, I get a constant 60 fps while playing, but in the editor i get 20 fps MAX. The controls are strange and feel uncomfortable, like all the controls in this game.4. Optimization. This point can be forgived because its an early access, but this game's optimization is pretty much non-existant.Thats all I have to say for now, I know this game is an early access and this is alot to ask, but this feels like the BARE MINIMUM of what can even be considered a ""game"". I'll keep it for now to see where it goes, but for now dont buy this game, save your hard earned cash."

76561198148565540,Recommended,552100,34489947,Posted: 25 August,all,Rattled Chucklenuts,"Do you have fond memories of playing with Legos growing up?Looking for a more advanced, mature alternative to Roblox or Blockland?Did you recently step on a Lego, and wish to take your anger out on it in virtual vehicle form?Then Brick Rigs is right for you!I've played just over 2 full days-worth of this game, and it's already became one of my all-time favorites. Brick Rigs can be described as a free-form block/brick-based vehicle building game, where the player can use the materials given to them to build whatever they wish. It runs off the same premise asSimplePlanes, where the name might imply only cars can be built (BrickRigs), but in reality, a multitude of different kinds of vehicles can be built, including planes, rockets, and helicopters.ProsThe game has enough parts (and now colors!) to allow you to build a multitude of different vehicles, ranging from trucks, to tanks, to trains, to even aircraft.The destruction physics work as you'd expect them to. Individual bricks can break off, explosions send them flying, and entire constructions can burn and crumble into a heap.Special parts like Actuators and Camera Controllers allow you to build complex and intricate creations.ConsOccasionally, physics on certain parts like detached wheels is strange.While this game's parts are based off real Lego parts, it does not contain the full spectrum of different parts Lego has to offer. (Technic parts, certain windshield pieces, certain wheel types, etc.) As such, players who are hoping to use official Lego manuals to build vehicles may have to cut some corners here and there due to lack of certain parts in-game.The grinders in the City and Sandbox maps often get parts stuck in them after a car is driven into them. I'm not sure if this is supposed to happen or not.As of writing this review, there's only 6 different maps to play with, but they're large enough and interesting enough to let this pass.Fuel Tanks feel less like they're actually adding to your total fuel capacity, and more just like parts to make your vehicle more explode-y. Like, seriously, who fuelsanythingwith Nitro and C4?!Detached wheels still make squealing noises, as though they're still being driven.Blown tires have no change in apperance, other than having the tire part lose its collisions with the ground.The texture for burning/burnt parts is ugly. It honestly looks more like white petrified dog turd than it does burning metal/plastic.The proportions of certain parts isn't accurate to their real-life Lego counterparts (mudguards, the 1x1x2 slope piece)Dying from rolling over in a car feels weird, as if it shouldn't be happening.In the hopes of making changes to this game for the better, I also have a few suggestions for the developer/developers themselves.Suggestions/Comments to the Developer(s)Weapons, player teams, Team Deathmatch and Zombie Mode...Why?Is this game a vehicle-building game, or a fast-paced FPS? Guns just seem like an unnecessary addition to a game like this, it's like adding a tower defense mechanic to a farming simulator. ""Professions"" try to make this game something like a DarkRP server in Garry's Mod, wherein, you can be a bunch of different things, but at the end of the day, you're just a player who's name and apperance is different, and you just have a different weapon or something.Player tools.Weapons like a generic pistol and a drab assault rifle try to add a level of realism and seriousness to this game that, quite frankly, doesn't need to be there. If there really needs to be something to put in the player's hands, why not something interesting and unique? For example, a Wrench that can repair broken blocks. Or a mini Jaws-Of-Life for ripping through vehicles by hand!Player customization.If the vehicles can have such such uniqueness in their appearance, why can't the players have it, too? There should be a system where you can customize your player's colors to how you want them. Not only would it remove the need for ""Professions"", it would make it easier to differentiate between different players!Smaller engines.Not all players are going to build huge vehicles that require large engines. Some players (like myself) like to build smaller vehicles capable of holding only one player. Perhaps a small 1x1x2 electric motor could be added, or a handheld R/C controller for players to use?Main menu background.The background in the main menu where you can blast apart vehicles with your mouse is nifty. Perhaps a Reset and Randomize button could be added to the main menu for the background, and possibly the ability to see your own creations in the background?Third-person while outside of a vehicle.When on foot, I feel like the player's hands are too close for comfort. Perhaps there could be a third-person button when outside of a vehicle, bound to left Ctrl?"

Figuring out how to make everything work in this game takes quite awhile.  Thats my first complaint.  My next is the controls.  They are pretty awful.  Only a few set ups(like for cars=wasd) are anywhere near intuitive.  In fact, so little in this game is intuitive that there is no way that you can just jump in and play(see complaint number one).  In the 30 min that I played, I FINALLY figured out how to accelerate a ground vehicle and get a chopper off the ground.  A third complaint is that the vehicles are much too fragile and tip very, very easily.  Which means that you will be driving down the road at a benign speed, begin to take a gentle curve and your vehicle will not only flip but shatter to pieces.  Also, the aircraft are very unbalanced and view angles so wonky that it promises a crash with aircraft as well.  I get that the devs might be trying to please the 6 year old crowd who love to see things flip and blow up but jeesh!  Of course Im being a little harsh since this is an EA game.  All of the things that I mentioned should be very easy to fix and adjust by the devs as they develop the game more.  I also expect that the finished version of the game will have a tutorial and a working help button(has a help button now-f1-but its not functional).  For me though, this game is simply FAR too much work to actually enjoy or recomend as it is.  Im gonna return it and advise folk to wait until its fleshed out and fine tuned much better than it is now.Oh yeah, and the vehicle editor is very bland with terrible cam views as well.  Having said all that Ive said, if this game eventually gets to a play level of or even close to that of ""Simple Planes"" then Ill come back to take another look at it."

Movement options are extremely limited, as you can only walk, jump, and sprint. It seems like the devs are aiming for tactical gunplay similar to ARMA, which actually works pretty well alongside the realism of the vehicular simulation, even with leaning, crouching, and prone being completely absent as of right now.But the worst part about the game is the lack of first person FOV slider as of this review. Because of this, navigating around vehicles and other obstacles is a bit of a chore, especially if you're used to playing games with an FOV of 120+."

I like that the game is physics based, and the ability to have a three-sixty degree rotatable camera in a LEGO® game. I think that the editor needs the ability to move your camera on the X, Y, and Z axis via W, A, S, D, [SPACE], and [CTRL].Parking Brake Advice:Make the parking brake stronger, so that it actually works to prevent a car from rolling down a hill), and make the parking brake not disable as soon as you re-enter the car.Gamepad/Controller Advice:Also, why isn't [Y] the key used to enter vehicles using a gamepad? [A] just doesn't make sense to me. [A] is usually the jump key, especially in LEGO® games. Also, can you add an option to increase the sensitivity for the view?

It's EA so that may be addressed later.Tried to play with my son (since playing solo doesn't appear to keep your interest). Connecting was easy and simple. I had the better machine so I hosted. He and his friend seemed to crash after every map ended though and a few times during the match, so that was problematic.The controls are absolutely horrible, especially for flying and more ""advanced"" vehicles such as tanks. Perhaps the single worst game with vehicle controls I've ever experienced. I hope those get ironed out.The concept is very cool, but the delivery wasn't. The controls were garbage, crashes were routine, total lack of optimization (even though it ran fine on my beast), and there just didn't seem to be a whole lot to it.Now it IS Early Access. The game isn't supposed to be fleshed out yet. I have a lot of EA games, been a huge supporter of EA games for a long time now. I know how it works. I've had some turn out to be gems, and some complete duds. Right now, this game feels like it needs a lot more work...like perhaps it is closer to alpha development than beta.I know others are really enjoying the game, and that's great...but for me, the controls and lack of stuff to actually do turned me off to the game. I'll check this out further along in development and perhaps change my review then."

Review might change with future updates.Interesting game with a lot of potential. Building mechanics are good, and the possibilities are close to endless.But the game is let down by terrible driving physics. Every surface feels like pure ice. Take a turn in more then 30 km/h and you will either go straight ahead or spin slowly out of control. Unless you have a car taller than 1 meter, because then you flip no matter what. Terrible. This makes this game very close to unplayable in current state. And its the same with both controller and keyboard.Other cons:- A lot of bugs that will explode your car or send you flying to the moon. This can be funny though.- Small maps.- Bad performance during multiplayer.Pros:- Good building mechanics with a lot of options. Best building mechanics i have tried in any lego game by far.- Good graphics. Looks stunning from time to time.- Great crash physics. Such a joy to watch pieces fly everywhere during a roll over crash.- Steam workshop to share content easy.- Huge potential.If they fix the terrible driving physics this will be one amazing game. Since it just recently got released in early access i have big hopes, but for now i cannot recommend. I will however try every patch, and will update review if/when things changes."

After reading some of the negative reviews, I had to add my own version of a review, considering a negative review talking about C++ or the Unreal engine hardly qualifies as a ""review"" considering this developer created neither of those.Did you grow up with Legos? I did. You don't buy a Lego set thinking you're getting a full gaming experience, pre-made for you in a single box. They are about creating things that you can then use on your own, as you like, within the limits of the building system.Welcome to Brick Rigs, nearly that exact same concept taken to the computer. No, there aren't stats. No, you don't level anything. No, there isn't a theme or story. If you want those things, you can use this thing called your ""imagin-ation"" and create them on your own; that was the whole charm of Legos and also of this game.Of those 89 current hours, about 80 were spent creating multiple ""objects"". Although the game is called ""Brick Rigs"" you can create nearly anything out of those bricks, so don't let the ""Rigs"" part limit your creativity. I've pushed this game well beyond it's car-inspired name, by creating game boards, houses, construction equipment and horrific city-leveling, atomic sized bombs.The other 9 hours, of course, were sepnt destroying said creations :)Lets talk about that destruction, shall we? Huge fireballs, roaring flames, charred blocks and pieces flying sky-high (including the destructable buildings)... do you really have to ask for more? Add a .01x slow-motion (that's a one-hundredth of real time) and you can experience a Matrix-like fireworks show. The perfect way to initiate your new creation to the world of Brick Rigs!Now, the usual complaints: It's early access so some features aren't fleshed out entirely. There are a fair number of non-game breaking bugs. Optimization is still a bit off so don't expect to run anything massive on a potato, or certain combinations of hardware.Counter to all of those though, the developer is active, replies to issues, fulfills requested features and isn't asking a small fortune for a game in this state. There have been plenty of other games in earlier states that go for more money than this - it's all relative.Out of 10, this game easily hits a solid 8."

For an early release game,  it has so much. You can build just about anything that is drivable known to man. You can make military vehicles, racing vehicles, aircrafts, and casual civilian vehicles. However, it's not easy when you first start. You won't have a clue how to put things in right positions at the beginning. But with practise, you can achieve some very visually and functionally appealing creations (like mine). And after you create your creation, you can crash it, wreck it, crush it, or whatever your heart desires to do with it. It's absolutley fun. And even if you have no clue how to build vehicles, you can download player made creations on the Workshop, and play with them in the game. Not only that, but you could dissect them, learn what makes them tick, how they run, and how to build.Pros:+Create any machine, building, or gun that your heart desires+Workshop supported+You can set your settings up fairly high without consequence (for low end PCs)+Multiplayer+Different modes (zombie mode and sandbox mode)+Different Maps+Easy ControlsCons:-Wheels can be fairly unstable-Builds can glitch in many ways if too many blocks interfere with each other-Play can act wonky (glitch through ground, etc)So if you love/loved building lego things, get this game. It's fantastic!"

The Early Access Feature exist to let the community get the game earlier and test it, and the developers can get money already to have money to improve the game. But before someone put a game in early access it atleast has to work a bit.. Like ARK and subnautica.1. PerformanceThe Performance of the FPS factor is completely fine. The game runs on unreal engine, good graphics and smooth fps. All fine with that A+2. BugsThe point where i hate the game. The bugs....For example: When im in multiplayer and i use a vehicle and get out of it, or get out of the editor, i mostly get stuck in the air of the map, and cant recover at garage or anything. I can disconnect and connect again then im back at the ground. But the bug comes again soon. And i can reconnect every few seconds...Also it happens from time to time that in the editor i cant spawn anything, no full vehicle save, nor single props.One thing that happens every few days too is that the mouse dissapears, and i cant see anymore where im clicking. Then i can restart the game....real fun to ""play""3. Workshop to use vehicle in multiplayer?!Seriously, what the hell. If your vehicle is too big for spawning in multiplayer (and that size is really not big...) you have to upload it in the workshop, subscribe your OWN upload, and then you can spawn the workshop vehicle and use it in multiplayer..thatsjust...no?Why? Even the message is ""cute"" ""There is a way to bypass that! just upload your vehicle to the workshop and download it, then yo ucan use it"" ....no. Thats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Instead of finding another way of ""bypassing"" it, how about just making the game able to spawn the vehicle in multiplayer no matter how big it is? To build a vehicle you either have to be in lonely singleplayer, or upload and download the vehicle very often because you for sure wanna test it if it even works...4. Price. 15 Euro or 15 Dollar, Fine. For a early access WOULD be ok, but not for this bad quality...ENDDo yourself a favour and buy the game later. When it became better.

Sounds great on paper but in its current state, doesn't play well in practice... yet.Definitely gonna remain hopeful for this one but some major issues need to be addressed first that I was able to assess in just a few minutes, such as...-Physics: Tires just don't have nearly enough contact on surfaces and therefore create a nearly uncontrollable ""ice like"" driving situation at just about any speed with any vehicle. Helicopter control is almost non-existent due to current control scheme the game is stuck with and honestly couldn't tell what aerodynamic physics were like because the heli was flipping instantly at take off with zero input.-Options: Crucial showstopping issues not yet implemented like key mapping (at least none that I could find), reasonable controller support, etc-Stability: What can I say? It's got to stay running without crashing for at least a few minutes in order for me to test reasonably and provide legitimate feedback.It's funny and quite a lot of fun to watch how bricks behave when bashing around, no doubt it.

The 5x size wheel is horrendously unstable and bouncy, it'll literally skip over the road than roll on it. All joints motion values are backwards, (so you will always set -90° for instance for a tipper hinge else it'll crush itself). Containers are in the game which sounds like fun except they're far bigger than vehicles in this game, and far too heavy, so only extremely basic mechanisms have any hope of not breaking trying to lift them. Winches fall appart on vehicle spawn 90% of the time, and break very often when attempting to use them, so are useless. These are all things that should be easy to catch with a single test of each.Basically, it's a game that could be fun, as the builder is fantastic - marred by the gameplay feeling completely, and almost certainly for the most part, untested.

I was super excited for this as it looked absolutely amazingly fun.Now please hear me out here. Yes I know it is early access but this is PRETTY bad.What could possibly be wrong with it you ask? Well lets get started.The LagThe game itself seems to be pretty laggy unless you set all your settings to low. On low settings the game runs pretty well......But at soon as you join multiplayer you realize. Any bit of explosions, any vehicle destruction, players spawning and respawning vehicles, and more just cause massive lag.It's just a big mess. While it's not the only reason it's a pretty good one. Creators of vehicles seem to use a massive amount of blocks to create these vehicles and make them detailed. So it's quite easy to imagine how this lags.I do also meet system requirements.Processor: 2.4 GHz Dual-Core 64-bit CPU ( I have a dual core as well)Memory: 4 GB RAM ( I have 6 GB )The PlayersDuring my gameplay I saw a few nice players who seemed to legitimately care about a friendly gameplay environment. Unfortunately I still met way more really really annoying players.My gameplay involved me getting shot at as soon as I spawned by a player waiting to camp a newly spawned player. Then later on another server a guy takes a vehicle with guns strapped all over the front of it and kills theENTIREspawn.MechanicsOther than my editor being laggy it became increasingly clear that making a vehicle is probably pretty dang hard. You build it exactly like you would regular legos so it takes some skill I think to get it right.Not only is it difficult the vehicles you make can look pretty amazing but still preform terrible. These vehicles are shakey, hard to control, and can literally just explode at spawn. Don't be fooled as the controlling of a vehicle is just plain awful.On sandbox people just randomly grab their weapons and start shooting everything/everyone. Rocket launchers are pretty OP unless the vehicle creator was really smart with the armor choicing. There is NO spawn protection at all that I know of. So yeah good luck surviving(Not like it matters considering you can hit ctrl+r to respawn where you died or backspace to respawn instantly at garage. It even fixes your vehicle.)ConclusionIn it's current state it is impossible for me to recommend it. From the various problems I faced I decided to request a refund before it was too late for me to do so.I understand if you don't agree with me but these problems can't be denied."

,Recommended,552100,30201138,Posted: 26 February,all,Blond Panda,"Brick Rigs can be best described as ""Rigs of Rods"" with Lego cars.The game allows you to build your own vehicles, use those that already come with the game or download custom vehicles from the workshop and then puts you in a sandbox environment where you can do as you please.There are a few sandbox missions scattered throughout, like drag races, checkpoint races or destruction missions but the meat of the game lies within doing whatever you want.You can build a race car and just drive around and enjoy the landscape, you can use a tank to wreck other vehicles and buildings, you can build some weird contraption that runs only on thrusters or you can run a truck down a deep hole.You start off the game as a simple figure in first person. Throughout the map you will find several garages. These allow you to build whatever vehicle you want and then let's you spawn it.You can also select any vehicles that already came with the game, ones that you've previously build yourself and ones that you downloaded from the steam workshop.The building is probably the best thing about this game.If you remember the old lego-racers games, it's a bit like this only more fleshed out.You can build everything yourself. It is completely up to you where you put the individual parts.Cars, planes, tanks, helicopters, jets, trucks or weird mixtures of all of these things, it is completely up to you what you want to build and what it's suppoed to look like.If you want your vehicle to be drivable, you'll need something to make it function. In most cases, this will be something like an electro motor, a V8 or a V12 but you can also use something like thrusters instead of an engine.If you put thrusters on your car, it usually makes them super fast, but you sacrifice the ability to reverse and often the physics just go insane when your car is this fast.Planes and helicopters are a different breed. I have no idea how to use them. Most maps don't appear to be built for them and the controls are somewhat obscure. If you want to have fun with this game, you should probably stick to things on wheels.Unfortunately even in cars, the handling leaves a lot to be desired. On higher speeds the handling often becomes super sensitive, leading to crashes and roll-overs. Cars also react very heavily to bumps on the road, often making your it fly all over the place, seemingly at random.This seems to be mostly independant of suspension and steering sensitivity settings.If I would recommend an aspect of the game that needs to be worked while the game is still in early access, it would be this. Make the driving more bearable.Seeing your car flip over and burst into pieces is fun, but sometimes you just want to drive and then it really gets in the way.There's also a few phyics bugs here and there.sometimes, parts get pushed below the surface, making them fall under the map and I've managed to fall out of the map several times, mostly due to a ridiculus crash catapulting me to such hights, that I surpassed the walls that are supposed to keep you from leaving the sandbox.There is also a multiplayer mode which I haven't tried too much, mostly because playing the game with random people isn't too much fun. Most of them just pick tanks and shoot everyone else.I can imagine this game being lots of fun with friends, though.I have noticed a glitch in multiplayer where my character would get stuck after leaving a vehicle, disabling me from moving at all. It gets quite anoying and is one of the reasons I mostly played the single player.The performance is usually stable.Sure, having the wrecks of dozens of cars lying around is bound to lower your framerate at times, but it tends to be reasonable. In multiplayer, however things can get a bit overwhelming, depending on the ammount of players and how many of those players are currently tearing down buildings with tanks.The game is visually appealing, all though the post processing adds a bit too much visual fluff at times. I'd love to be able to enable or disable individual graphical elements so I could only turn of things like motion blur (the blur effect on moving vehicles looks a bit odd) and depth of field without disabling all other processing effects aswell.I've also noticed that the menues are a bit off in scale. I use a 1280*1024 monitor, so all the buttons are a bit weird in size and positioning and the GUI can sometimes get in the way. Especially in the building menu where I only have a small window to work with, because of the menu elements.All in all Brick Rigs is a fun game with a great building system and some impressive destruction. But the rather weak handling and the lack of control over flying vehicles limit the fun that could be had with it.I would recommend it to those who enjoy games like Beam NG, Rigs of Rods or even the old Lego Racers games, assuming you can look past its early access state. If you are unsure, however, I'd recommend you wait and see if aspects like the handling are fixed in the future."

,Recommended,552100,31083429,Posted: 11 April,all,HTH_Gaming,"Brick Rigs is essentially a mash-up of Lego Digital Designer and Lego Creator (from 1998). I don't say that as a negative thing, however! The ability to not only build whatever vehicle you want and then drive and destroy it in an open world was and still is extremely appealing to me, and that was what the old Lego Creator game was all about. However, the '98 game had its limits. Due to the technology of the time, the graphics and lighting sucked, and playing it in the early 2k, more and more Lego bricks were not available in the game due to it being distributed on a CD with no updates.Jumping to today with Brick Rigs, it has that same build-em' and break-em' mentality that I loved as a kid, and it has a spectacular graphics and lighting engine. I even dare to say that it's Creator on steroids. BUT, the one thing that I am not too happy about is the lack of variety of bricks. It makes recreating some Lego models extremely difficult, either trying to find a substitute or ditching a part of it completely. But, since BR is still Early Access, I hope to see that this problem is eliminated. (Or maybe some genius will find a way to import their own bricks into the game... Much like Blockland.) I'm also not too big of a fan of how some vehicles handle. I know from reading past reviews and developer updates that sliding has been an issue, but at least it doesn't make the game unplayable. There's also no AI in the single-player sandbox. No other vehicles driving around (except for the train in the city map), no AI minifigs, it's just you. Hopefully that'll change.Overall, this is a great time waster that I've enjoyed thus far, and I'm excited to see what kind of updates the developers will release in the future.TL;DR:Pros:Great graphics and lighting engineBuild-em' and break-em' mentality that feels slightly childish yet oddly refreshingOpen world maps, quite a bit to exploreCons:Lack of variety of bricks to build withVehicles occasionally 'slide'No AI in single-player sandbox mode"

DONT BUY IT!!!So will tell you why the comunity is so horrible.Alot of people who just ruin the fun cuz they know only PVP so in my opinion in the next update should come a function for sandbox that allows you be in god mode but without weapons and your car should be invisible for rockets too.If you join a server with 2 people you will be constantly killed cuz in the most situations those 2 poeple are 2 friends who want to trigger you.And there is a kind of people which i mostly hate who are just camping with rocket launchers at the garage and constantly destroy your building.

You would think such a mix would be unatractive, but it will most likely waste the lives of some us.  If you like lego games or like taking special screenshots (espacialy propaganda for the Soviet motherland) then brickrigs will be enjoyable.BuildingWhat is a lego game without building, a bad one.  The building system at first may seem difficult or hard, but later on you will realize is there so you can build more percisely.  You can pick the material and color of the brick and there are lots of bricks.  You can make helicopters, planes, trucks, and trains using the great selection of parts.MapsThere are I believe six maps currently a three game modes.  There is Sandbox, Battle, and Zombie.  Sandbox is normal while battle is an orginized FPS with your vehicles.  Zombie is just where you survive hordes of zombies.GameplayThere are some handheld weapons (but no blood for those who are younger).  The vehicles drive quite nicely nothing really to complain about.  If a vehicle is bad it is the person who made it's fault not the game.WorkshopThis game has great workshop support.  For those new comers that means that there is lots of content to download.  Almost any vehicle you can think of is there.  They just may have a specific name.IssuesI wish for one thing and that is mod support on the workshop.  I feel that any mods at all would make a great improvement for brick rigs.  The last thing I ask for is mabye a map editor.  But that could be intoduced with a certain level of modding capeabilities.If you want any more information please just ask me in the comment section."

76561198063610665,Recommended,552100,35086241,Posted: 20 September,all,Max,"This is one of those games I would like to have had a neutral feedback option for.I love the concept and the overall presentation as well, designing once you get a hand of it is quite powerful etc and I think this game will end up being quite good.The physics is modeled quite well with weight, torsion, spring, bounce, collisions etc all being a factor.You can build just about anything you want with actuators of all shapes and sizes and angles, motors, propellers, wheels etc so your imagination is really the limit here.The workshop has tens of thousands of examples, some very well done, planes, trains, helicopters, cranes, trucks, dragsters, rock crawlers, atv's, jeeps, trailers and more!My current gripes are how easily everything falls apart, this topic we are bringing up again and again, I hope it gets fixed soon but in a dynamic manner with say a slider that lets players choose how well ""stuck together"" the blocks are.Another thing is multiplayer, currently it ""works"" but needs a decent amount of additional work and options to become stable and really usable long-term.There is no dedicated server option (just P2P atm), no password or whitelist feature, no way to promote another player to admin to manage the gaming session and unfortunately crashes especially while changing maps.Auto-cleanup of debris and abandoned vehicles is also essential for keeping up performance and clearing up the ""junk"".Performance is overall quite good with plenty of options to tweak for your system.It uses the Unreal Game Engine.Overall I like where this is going, it just needs some attention to specific important details and polishing of multiplayer to take it from its current ok/good status to great.Keep up the work Dev. you have done a decent job so far and I would love to see this title grow."

,Recommended,552100,35356829,Posted: 30 September,all,JustARegularNerd,"Short ReviewIt's hard to make a decision because the game is really fun, but needs more time invested into bug fixing and multiplayer improvement. I will recommend it, but only if you're willing to deal with trolls who use their RPGs to spawn kill you (not entirely the game's fault) and the multiplayer technical issues.Detailed ReviewIt's a great game, but like everyone else is saying, it needs major improvements.Multiplayer needs major improvements. The server browser needs the ping column fixed, multiplayer gameplay is alright until you get disconnected 5 minutes later because of an unreliable outgoing buffer and respawning when another player is already at the spawn point results in a war of Backspace mashing.On the Canyon map, there's water. How beautiful, I'll go for a skinny dippi-- Oh.. it's not water. I can walk right through it like it's air.Needs more realistic manual driving (not a major issue). You should be able to use the engine as a brake and you shouldn't be able to lower your revs while going 300km/h in 1st gear, the engine should normally explode by that point.On the plus side, it is tremendously fun and that's the thing that's keeping everyone at it. Do whatever you want, go for a drive across the Canyon map, get on a rail with a train, or just plain shoot everything.In conclusion, I will recommend this because I will still play it for a long time, but only if you're willing to withstand online trolls that spawnkill with RPGs (just join a new server) and multiplayer issues.EditFixed formatting issues"

But it has major issues as it is in early access, servers cannot handle much and constantly crash; in some of the instances the game will completely crash to desktop and has increased lately even with not much activity occcuring both in on and offline play; aircraft and helicopters hopefully have placeholder controls cause if not they are very rough to work with most of the time. Honestly it has tonnes of potienal and is plenty of good dicking about fun, just needs some work."

The developer seems quite active and often adds new features and content which is nice for an EA game.  If you enjoy building things out of blocks and/or want to hit back up your childhood (in a sense) and build with ""legos"" to destroy things I would suggest this game.  It has a Multi-Player aspect which might strike your fancy but I've not tested it to really delve into that aspect.I simply enjoy the sandbox environment, perhaps in time the dev will add an AI element to the game but right now it is very much sandbox about building and destroying things on your own or with your friends.  If you're looking for a ""living"" environment this game probably won't do it for you.  If you (and your friends) enjoy building whatever comes to mind and destroying it or racing one another's creations I would consider this game."
