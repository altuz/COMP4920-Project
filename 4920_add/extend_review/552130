76561198025372405,Recommended,552130,28240041,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,Galacticfish,"Just installed and played the game for a short bit.  It appears to be based on the Unreal engine, so the physics are pretty good.  The graphics aren't the best, but everything is colorful and nothing detracts from the game.  You play as a test dummy ragdoll and are given quick missions in real time via a console on the bottom left of the screen.  For example ""jump off the tower"" then ""drive over a guy"".  Your points total in that console as well.   The world is full of objects and people you can run into, kick, run over, jump on, fly into, explode, etc.  There are literally endless ways to cause mayhem and destruction.  The control and movements can be a little wonky at times, but for the price this is a great way to have mindless fun."

It's the perfect game to play after a stressful day, and just ragdoll/stunt around the map for a while. Very versatile game with probably hours of fun! Well worth the 10 Bucks. :)"
,Not Recommended,552130,31856951,Posted: 20 May,all,WindySilver,"I finally bought this on sale, since this seemed very fun. Being a test dummy, creating havoc, doing stuff, a big world... It sounded better than Goat Simulator. The graphics looked very great too!Unfortunately, no matter how much I tried to like this and think I did not like it because I first played it when I was tired and that my tiredness caused me to dislike it, I'd rather just return playing as a goat even though currently I have little to do aside from causing random destruction in Goat Simulator. Why? I have many reasons:First of all, movement: Running is just too slow, and vehicles tend to be hard to control. It became boring.Controls: Especially Ragdoll and Interact commands are very unresponsive, and I doubt it's because my keys would be broken; as I am writing this, I have no problem with the keys R and E, the letters appear to this interface just as all the other ones.Collectible items and missions: The game does not remember which items I picked up last time and what missions I did. If you close the game (or it crashes), you have to start all over again. You get the achievements, but the game does not remember a thing.Houses: As far as I saw, all the houses can be entered, but it turned out that they are literally empty. Some have small toilets in the corner, but some are simply 100% empty small rooms.Gamebreaking bugs: While bugs are a part of the game, there are some that make you relaunch the game (which feels like a quite a slow process): The menu icons not disappearing, physics bugging so that you can't walk and thus are forced to be on ragdoll all the time, dummy getting stuck into buildings, ground, etc. so bad you can't move... Those bugs are not funny.I really, really wanted to like this, and this has lots of potential to be great. However, I did not find this enjoyable. It's a shame that this became my first refund. :("

Still think it is a lot of fun though. Nothing like drop kicking people as a crash test dummy!!"
