Serious Sam is pure fun. It's in early access, which means the cutscenes and dialogue and the like are missing, but the game experience  itself, at least as far as I've gotten, is complete.Imagine the action of wave shooter like Space Pirate Trainer that you can play with teleport locomotion like Arizona Sunshine or trackpad locomotion like Onward, played on gigantic, free-roaming multi-level maps in grand temples and outdoor vistas like you find in Solus Project. Find secret doors and compartments. Look for hidden loot and power-ips. Mix it all together with enemies that range in size from giant toads to skyscrapers all trying to kill you from every direction. Throw in duel-weilded rocket launchers, tommy guns, double barred shotties, pulse rifles, chainsaws and giant black powder cannon, mix it all up and start shooting. Throw in multiplayer co-op, just for the hell of it. That's Serious Sam. And the whole thing is now in VR.Doom 3 showed how a classic FPS could be converted into VR. Serious Sam FE VR shows what can be done with a little professional TLC thrown on top. Even in Early Access it's got all the features built in, mainly because it's the same great game Croteam perfected so long ago, brought up to modern standards.Except now it's in VR, and you can freely aim your rocket launcher at the gargantuan scorpion monster in front of you while sweeping your tommy gun behind your back to take care of those pesky suicide bombers trying to flank you. Sam, it's great to have you back."

It's not for everyone.Pro tip: If you aren't at risk for VR sickness, turn on the touchpad motion controls, and find the control to change strafing to be head position based, not ""hand position based""... you will be circle strafing like an old pro, with the VR fun of aiming much improved, original weapons, dealing with enemies that have been adapted to VR (that is, they are in smaller numbers and have new mechanics like shooting down certain incoming projectiles, and much more), and, well, etc.It's completely excellent. If you are Serious enough, get the settings right, and revel in the amazing hardcore experience. If this kind of game is your kind of game, it's 11/10, because it's the best at being exactly what it is."

Offer people choice of movement, and dont compromise.  Loads of old games will make GREAT vr experiences, and this one is among the best I've played on the Vive so far (Quake was also fantastic btw). It reminds me of playing Half-Life 2 on the original Oculus DK1 in fact.  One of the best VR experiences I've had.  Wish I could do it again, with motion controls just like this."

,Recommended,552450,33714936,Posted: 22 July,all,Wildt,"This game is essentially the HD version of ""First Encounter"" but with VR - and this review will only focus on the things that seperates those two versions.I played it on an Oculus Rift CV1 with Touch controllers.The VR implementation is really well done. The devs understood that there is no silver bullet locomotion method that'll satisfy everybody, and implemented a bunch of options. There's both blink teleportation and traditional stick locomotion. There's also smooth or snap turning. I went full oldschool with smooth rotation and analouge stick movement. There are even 3 options for ""forward"": Head direction, hand direction and room orientation.Emulating my old mouse/keyboard playstyle with these controls was a bit iffy at first, but once I got the hang of it, it was second nature again.One of the biggest differences in gameplay vs the flat version is that you can dual wield ANY weapon. This means the devs had to re-balance the damage model somewhat, making the weapons feel a bit weaker. Still feels awesome having a minigun in each hand mowing down hordes of enemies :)I don't know if the scaling has changed from the flat version or if it's just VR making you perceive it differently, but one thing is for sure: Everything is so impressively gigantic. From the building structures to the big enemies. It really adds an epic element to it all.Of course I would've loved improved assets for the VR version, as the 3d models and textures don't hold up very well compared to other 2017 VR titles, but it's tolerable.Having some new custom animations for chainsaw kills would've been awesome. Instead you get the same old animation regardless of which angle you slice 'em. This made the chainsaws feel so unsatisfying to use that I abandoned them completely within 10 minutes.The only bugs I experienced was during the last boss fight which still hasn't been fixed with the latest patch. Since the devs felt that jump pads would be too intense in VR, they changed the mechanics of activating the big laser gun, and they messed something up, so that the rings are sometimes unreachable, or simply not working. I finally managed to cirumvent the bugs and kill the boss, but the achievement didn't unlock.Despite the mess they made with the last fight, imo Croteam succeded in bringing FE to VR. Even though there are some discounts when you own certain other SS titles, I find the price a bit steep.Still, there aren't many VR fps shooters out there that can scratch the same old school itch like this title.70%"

It's not designed from the ground up for VR. It's frenetic. Perhaps overy so for VR, certainly for me.There isnt another title that has had me breathing heavily, hoping for a break in the action to catch my breath. Perhaps Doom BFG with the VR mod to an extent at times, Arizona Sunshine in horde mode..I'd recommend it certainly, supporting projects like this are what will get us titles built from the ground up for VR.It definately has it's flaws, the teleportation mechanic is.. clunky, and fairly poor. The trackpad locomotion option is certain to have some people reaching for their toilet to hug, but for all that, it has it's charm."

I liked The Last Hope but it was just OK. I finally got First and Second encounter when it went on sale. I have to say, this is awesome! I wish more developers would add VR support to old games.  The game runs smooth... no bugs... no issues.... no glitches... easy to understand controls. I set mine up with head tracking for straff, classic movement (no teleport), rotation controller to NONE and confort mode OFF. I got zero motion sickness but I am quite used to VR now. The only problem I had was with the defective VIVE controllers. This was the first game I had played a game that relied heavily on the trackpad and both of my controllers were having trouble clicking right so I would stop moving constantly and get whacked hard. Very frustrating!! But once I learned what was going on and that this was a very common problem with the Vive controller I simply turned click to move off and had no problem after that."

To say I was excited for this release is an understatement - after a particularly grating Sunday, I saw that it was announced for release on the 20th (today) and couldn't wait.I even ran home for lunch today to check it out! It blew me away. If you aren't familiar with the Serious Sam series, I suggest looking into it before picking this game up, but it's a bunch of guns, a bunch of enemies, and a lot of secrets and open spaces to fight through. This is the exact game that I fell in love with in 2001, but in VR, with dual wielding. That means a full singleplayer campaign, co-op, online versus mode, and survival all here for you in sweet virtual reality.Locomotion can be something to get used to - it defaults to a teleportation mode, and you can also strafe with the control sticks/touchpad. I looked on the discussion forums and found a cvar for actual movement with the control sticks, and it was my favorite way to play. Motion sickness varies, but I get it bad with some games, and this game barely made my stomach feel anything.It runs solid with my GTX 1080, and I imagine it will run on the lower end VR capable cards as well, as Croteam has always been very good at optimization.I had been talking with my brother about co-oping all the Serious Sam games together, and he was lazy about it - now we can co-op it in VR!!!I truly hope Croteam goes all in for VR - it's obvious they have a passion for it, and their IP's also fit well. If we could get the rest of the Serious Sam franchise, as well as Talos Principle, some of the best ""flat"" content would be in VR.... let alone what else they've been working on.A huge, huge thanks to Croteam, for expanding my view of gaming a second time. I hope a lot of VR enthusiasts are able to enjoy the world of Serious Sam for the first (or perhaps the hundredth) time!P.S. Check out the hippie blood mode - it can be quite refreshing.(Using an Oculus Rift with 2 sensors in 360 mode. Works great, still planning on getting a third eventually though.)"

And what's more it works very well.The shooting mechanics are spot on; getting a bead on an enemy takes split seconds.There is teleportation, but I went for classic movement with the comfort option off.  An excellent movement mechanic allows one touchpad to be forward and strafing, while the other touchpad allows turning.  Press both pads in the forward position and you run.  At the same time you cn point the weapons in the direction of travel you desire.  For large outide areas you can effectively move like you are on a skateboard.  You can combine elements of the movement options to suit the game; fast turning movements in the larger arenas, and slow and carefull in some temples.In larger environments I found the movement allows for some creative maneuvers.For some reason I held of buying this game, as i thought it was to true to be true, but its not.

You can also dual weild, which wasn't a thing in the original game. You get so much firepower and so many enemies run at you. It can be hectic and frustrating, but it's the gamest game I've played on my vive so far. You shoot guys and blow them into bloody piles. There are monsters and aliens running around, and giant enemy bosses. The environment is also fun to look at. Monuments look monumental, and you really get a sense of scale when you see everything actually in front of you. The controls are mostly intuative with the only issue I had being swimming. Shooting feels accurate without any auto-aim, and the laser sight they give you on the more accurate guns really helps for sniping farther targets. Overall, I think it's a great purchase."

VR makes those downsides far less of a problem, as it is so much fun just pointing and blasting away at endless enemies no matter what they look like.Which brings me to the best point about this game: The controls!Serious Sam VR: The First Encounter has THE best implementation of controls in any VR FPS game so far.They have gone the extra mile to implement every possible option in favor of letting the user customize the experience as they see fit for either the best immersion setting or best comfort setting, whatever suits you.It has:- Teleportation- Free locomotion with Strafing- Oriented from the controller- Oriented from the head set- Smooth Turning- Snap TurningAnd much much more.I am personally playing it with full free locomotion, strafing, with orientation to the head set and it is perfect! The gameplay is as fast paced as the classic DooM/Duke3D style games except its in VR and you can point and shoot in all directions with your motion controllers.

This is a genre that no one has even really figured out how to do in VR, going all-in with an old school run 'n' gun like Serious Sam was a bold move, but Croteam managed to pull it off!But more than that, ""Serious Sam VR: The First Encounter"" shows off possibilities that are only possible with VR. Unsurprisingly, for a fast-paced shooter like Serious Sam, the ability to run in one direction, while looking in a different direction AND aiming two guns in two different directions is very useful. Essentially, it turns you into Reaper from Overwatch. And your ultimate is charged 100% the time.Pros and cons:+ It's Serious Sam fully working in VR!+ It controls wonderfully if you're using trackpad locomotion (I hope you have good VR legs!).+ Dual-wielding guns and shooting them in different directions is a blast.+ Lays the groundwork for how FPS games, locomotion and porting older games can be done in VR.- It's still the same old Serious Sam: The First Encounter.- Enemies seem to glitch around occasionally.- Trackpad locomotion can be a bit finicky, sometimes Sam comes to a stop if you click the pad instead of just touching, which is hard to avoid doing.- Weapon models don't match up to where they feel like they should (i.e your finger isn't positioned on the trigger of the shotgun.- Duel-wielding feels a bit un-sporting."

The classical artificial locomotion with thumbpad is just perfect for Serious Sam and very well done, but it's also extremely sickening. On the other hand, teleportation is horrible here, not because Croteam did it wrong (they could be the stronger team developing for VR just now) but because Serious Sam had to be played in constant movement/strafing, so teleport here means clicking with your thumb all the time. It's not an elegant and playable teleportation like many other games, because this kind of teleportation need a gameplay focused on fighting in static positions, here you're forced to do the opposite.This, like many other situations, demonstrate than options on VR locomotion are rarely the right solution to the problem. Let's think how horrible Onward would be with teleportation. This one is not much better, in my opinion, teleport here ruin the game than is instead excellent but just if you're able to play as it's meant to be played.My downvote, as i respect Croteam so much, is for visibility as this game has yet an overwhelming amount of positive reviews and my won't change that, and negative are much on ""it's not fun"" mood. Well, it's extremely fun and super polished, you need this! But just if you're capable to resist to sickness, after a couple of years in VR I've ended all my will to be dizzy all the day just for playing. Teleportation here is simply not fun to play and dangerous for your thumbs and your controllers (the ""click"" switch in the thumbpad is easy to broke in Vive wands, here you're going to fast click non stop for hours).If Croteam in future would implement a viable solution to make the game comfortable without ruin the gameplay I would be more than happy to buy the game again and change my vote."

Constantly having to do 180° turns (like in an air dogfight)  is not the same in VR than with WASD + mouse, so what worked well on a flatscreen does not work so well for me in VR.And above all, the game kept crashing constantly. I had to start a game over because the save was corrupted and kept on crashing on load. Later on, it also crashed systematically on a cutscene, and I couldn't go further this cutscene despite many attempts. I had to refund it for that reason.I like the Last Hope much better despite its lack of locomotion.Nevertheless, I might buy it again one day if progressive (analogical) locomotion is added, if you can reduce walking speed more (I know it would make the game harder but I don't care), and when crashes are fixed. But at the moment the price tag is too high to keep a game I cannot play.On the pro, the game runs smoothly, even with my gtx970 and the insane speeds, and it's cool to have a fully featured game in VR. Yet it's cool, but not enough..."

The VR aspect brings with it an awesome dual-wielding weapon mechanism and it brings to life the beautiful scenery, putting you right in the action.  To move, you teleport a few feet at a time, though there is an option for smooth movement if you can stomach it.  Teleporting was too jarring and cumbersome for me, and the smooth movement was too motion-sickness inducing.  To turn, you must physically turn; this is fine for the first minute or two, but it gets clunky and your wires will get twisted easily.

This looks like they took one of those early-days-of-gaming titles and just ported it to VR without improving anything. The inside of the temple, for instance - it looks like someone spent about an hour or two writing the layout, then built up the rooms on such a simplistic level that there's absolutely no joy in exploring them or looking around. It looks like they're using exactly the same tiles, over and over, without variation. Everything is the same shape, repeated again and again. The ammo and charge-ups look like something out of the 90s - which could be charming but the jumping-mechanism combined with the crappy graphics and the fact that moving around within the play space doesn't really change anything just makes it feel like a total rip-off.I think it's great that they decided to port this game to VR. More big name games should take advantage of this niche while it's still content- thirsty (preferably newer, prettier games...but you've gotta start somewhere). But this kind of repurposed content should either be released at a price point that fits that (see prices for Doom BFG or The Solus Project) or some serious resources should be put into it to update it to something that could at least have been an excuseable discount-rack game from the last 5 years or so!For comparison to other converted-to-VR titles:1. This game is graphically on par with Doom BFG with respect to actual model complexity - but the models and textures in Doom are just more varied and customized and therefore that game is just much much better to walk around in, for instance...and in terms of the presentation and plot and polish this game is way, way way below Doom BFG.2. I hate to insult The Solus Project by comparing either the graphics or presentation/plot to this garbage. Solus had far, far better models, textures, a lot more variety of both, every single scene in Solus was clearly created by a team of actual artists and is breathtaking to walk around in. And the presentation and story in Solus is actually groundbreaking for modern gaming, while this one is virtually plot free, and presentation is extremely clumsy and basic.I think Solus was priced at $25 and Doom BFG at $15 when I bought them. Try $10 for this one. Not $40. As in, are you freaking serious?Overpricing a remake of an old AAA title implies that the old game has been re-made to fit the standards of the time. I see $40 and I assume that you are attempting to recoup that recent investment. This game has not been remade to even attempt meeting modern gaming standards. Not by a long shot."

It basically brings all the old game glory to VR with grande environments, beautiful graphics and all the familiar enemies and pick ups. There isn't much of a learning curve with this game. You can jump in and start fragging. It does have a help menu so you know what the buttons do. It has teleport which in my opinion works just fine with this game and the faster your finger the faster you can teleport around. Don't believe the other reviews that it takes away immersion. It is just as fun to play. The only trick with teleporting is that you have to dodge some of the enemies by doing a quick teleport and turn to take your shot. Like when the bulls come at you. I find that challenging and fun. With practice it gets easy. Trackpad movement is fast and smooth but can make those who are sensitive queezy or VR sick. Here the trick to lessen sickness is turn your body with each turn you make. Like when turning sharp corners: you want to go left then as you start to make your turn turn your body in that direction. You are less likely to feel the virtigo feeling. I like both forms of locomotion as it adds a little different approach to the game with each play. This is a free roam linear experience like the regular game. Kill or be killed. This is a definate buy.

After setting that up I can look around and pretty well with just some tolerable tracking issues. Check out the game options and see what works best for you.I would like to see the devs get some support for mouse/keyboard setup on 180 on some titles, even if it is a mod. I like having tracked controllers and all but miss the mouse/keyboard so I can sit down and have a drink while I get my game on."

Even if you were like me and you didnt like the other recent serious sam because it was just another wave shooter, you are going to love this. It's not a wave shooter! Yay! Even the wife, who hates fps, played this game for 30 minutes straight. That definitely says something. Possibly the best vr game so far."

I was afraid games like this wouldn't accomodate someone sensitive to VR but they've got me and you covered. There's a lot of options for tweaking your prefered teleport or dash. Now I can wiz across maps as fast as anyone else without feeling awful.This feels like back in the day when games were simple, exciting, and new. The game isn't the prettiest since it's 15 years old but in VR it makes it feel new again. That's what's so great about VR now. We can take it back to simpler times when highscores, and creativity mattered more than microtransations and the same carrot on a stick game mechanics for ADD♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"

Really a must-have for any shooter fan and it provides lots of locomotion options, so all non-trained VR-players can enjoy it too!"
