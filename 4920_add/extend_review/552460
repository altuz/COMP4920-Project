,Recommended,552460,30954753,Posted: 4 April,all,The Amorphous Orifice,"Perfect VR implementation.For anyone who isn't sure, I'll put this at the top of my review: This is the FULL game. This is not a rail shooter or a standing still, wave-based, or tower-defense game. You fully explore, strafe, platform, and blast your way through this whole game.I think this is an excellant example of how we don't need VR games. We just need games that are in VR.The Price point is worth it, expecially if you've never played a Serious Sam game before. Great action. Great gunplay. The dual wielding is not only fun as hell, but strategic. You can keep your pistol in one hand to handle weak enemies, and your rocket launcher in the other to handle the big ones.The menu is wonderful, fast, and intuitive. Selecting weapons feels good, and maybe more importantly, the quick save is very fast and fluid. Might even be easier than pressing a function key.Same old Serious Sam action, which really proves that the fast paced gameplay of games like this, or hypothetically, for example, Quake, can work delightfully in VR.Appropriately includes multiple options for locomotion. Looks to only have several types of teleporting, and ""Classic"" slide movement, though. No Climbey-style arm swinging. (But who would want that anyway? Wouldn't be able to aim your guns while running.) The classic sliding puts you into tunnel-vision while moving to prevent motion sickness by default. The tunnel-vision effect is called ""Comfort Mode"" in the options and that can also be turned off if you don't need it.Beyond the VR features (Which are ideal) this is still just good ol' Serious Sam. Same weapons, levels, and enemies. Tons of fun and timeless gameplay.If you're looking for the VR game that's going to give you something meatier than 15 dollars Wii Sports remakes and room escape games, here's the one."

They have both onward style movement and teleportation. Both with different methods of comfort options to make each work the best for you."
,Recommended,552460,30951313,Posted: 4 April,all,Adreus Bjorn,"Great bang for your buck if your serious about full length vr games. Played first encounter vr and this and never touched the series prior, and croteam has made a fan through supporting the vr community.You get a solid full length campaign including all dlcs, multiplayer vs, coop, and a survival wave shooter mode, but this is by no means a wave shooter.It also features a slew of movement options, including your basic teleport and onward style. You can adjust you speed, if you want rotation or not, lock movement to the hmd, and even a comforte mode that dims the sides when you move.Everything looks and feels great and id highly recommend this as a must have in any serious vr gamers library."

For me the trackpad locomotion works perfectly! Now I know that sooner or later all the big AAA games will work in VR. If you can run around like in SS why not in a game like WoW or Tomb Raider (climbing or jumping is no problem too!)? Sooner or later I think all the people will have no problem with trackpad locomotion. Why? A friend of mine is, sorry I don`t know the English word, something with brain/psycology Doctor and he just told me that he, even without trying he simply knows that getting used to a ""new kind of movement"" is a basic function of our brain. And he is right. The more often you play the more you get used to VR and will feel comfortable.The point is: SS is serious fun! -->  Buy it!"

76561198030466109,Recommended,552460,34597330,Posted: 29 August,all,T4H_Dingle,"I once saw YouTubers play slow paced VR horror demos on the Oculus Rift DK1 back in 2012. While watching them, THIS was the fantasy VR game that glimmered in the back of my head. I knew this new technology would one day let me fall into a world with rich, varied environments to explore (and be rewarded for exploring), quick movement, tonnes of bad guys and a sh*tload of weaponry at my disposal. I'll be honest, I've never played anything from the Serious Sam series before owning VR, but this was one hell of an introduction to say the least.I just want to say thank you to the guys at CROTEAM for taking the time out to do this for VR. In a market full of wave shooters, teleportation and slower paced full locomotion, this was exactly the itch I needed to scratch. Now for my list.PROS:- FULL LOCOMOTION... need I say more?- Great, old school arena styled fast paced shooting.- A crap-load of weapons. Pistols, shotguns, sub-machine guns, chainsaws and even giant cannons are all dual wieldable and make you feel totally bad*ss.- Rich and varied environments that you feel inclined to explore for hidden gems.- Online multiplayer and co-op support.CONS:- You may feel uneasy during and after first few sessions. THIS DOES GO AWAY!- Cutscenes are buggy and crash the game if I try to pull up the weapon menu.- 1 second long loading screens sometime come up when moving between environments. Can be annoying when in the middle of a shootout.UPDATE SUGGESTIONS:- Perhaps a player movement speed slider option to compensate for both first time players and elites.- Option to turn off thumb stick rotation (I know there is one but it resets to right thumb every time I restart game)- Maybe the jungle environment on the main menu screen could change up as you progress through the game?Not much else for me to say. I f*cking love this game and can't wait to finish this review to jump back into it."

So first up Serious Sam games in VR are amazing and I want more old school devs to do this. Playing games you played when you were younger makes you feel good, VR makes you feel excited, the combination is like being a kid again.This game is perfectly ported into VR, it plays great. It's really a blast.It's better value for money than The First Encounter, as it's a bit longer. It's also a bit more varied and in general they tried to mix up the combat, the environments etc enough that it does feel like an improvement.It does come with a few more sections that feel like a slog, and the bosses aren't nearly as cool as the end boss from The First Encounter, but the gameplay is great and the big fights are on average better than in The First Encounter.Croteam demonstrating that they are gods of chaos once again, I will insta-buy anything they put out in VR because the quality is always very high."

76561198059552109,Recommended,552460,31088330,Posted: 11 April,all,dumstah,"A plea to other developers; DO WHAT CROTEAM HAS DONE !!!FINALLY a reason for me to have bought the Vive. Enough of the poorly optimized and silly stuff that has dominated VR. This game ROCKS !!! No plot who cares. You are immersed and fighting for your life. What a riot !!!Before this game I was ready to sell my VIVE. now I am already planning my next VR machine build when the newer games and/or hardware comes out.A full game with fantastic action and a real sense of immersion. I have played it for many hours now and its a no brainer, it seriously works. I play with comfort mode turned off  and no teleportation. By sitting on an old piano stool (finally a use for that too) that rotates my motion sickeness is pretty much gone. You simply spin on the stool to turn and navigate with the left thumpad and pointing your left weapon. I can really rock with this setup the action and mobility is beyond expectation. turning with the right trackpad in analog mode will make you sick, so I just use discrete turning with that (45/90 degree sort of thing). !For someone who has refused to play a game that is not Nvidia 3d vision (thank you Helix Mod) for many years now, I can assure you that this is a totally compelling experience. It performs amazingly well and the graphics are very satisfying. Considering the low res of the VIVE this game is still eye candy,I am running 2 980ti cards overclocked in sli, and this game runs on ultra+ with no stutter. It is running both cards at about 50percent each. Sli seems to be working fine. So happy to finally be able to use my hardware properly.After my experience with this game, I went right out and paid full price for the remainder of the package to support Croteam. I was hesitant at first to buy any of these as most VR games I have bought or tried were a total dissapointment. I have returned a good number of turkeys.These games are totally worth full price to me. No questions asked.Cannot say enough about Croteam, they really know how to develop software.BUY THIS GAME. SUPPORT CROTEAM.G."

It's full game with full controls, not a teleporting wave shooter.  The Devs have basically let the player's decide what control system works for them.Most movement thumbpad games make me sick pretty quickly.  This game, once setup correctly for me doesn't.  For me... full speed running using the touchpads, which I discovered works great as long I remove rotation from my thumbs.   I setup left/right on the thumbpads for strafing.   Once I got my control system figured out... I now have a full fun crazy duel wielding shooter with interesting environments to work through.I'm writing this review after only playing 20 minutes, but I have put some hours into the VR First Encounter, which I also liked.  This game is similar (obviously) to that, but the environments, graphics, and enemies are better in this one.Oddly some of the chaos of the SS is reduced based on being able to use both hands to shoot in two directions (at two enemies) at once.I bought the first game with full intentions of getting a refund if I wasn't enjoying it (re: getting sick, or simply not fun)... I almost did, until I played with the control settings.  I'm glad I did.   Now, the 2nd is out and it was a must buy for me.THANK YOU devs for giving players control of their VR experience/controls.I hope more developers realize that full motion VR shooters CAN WORK!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, if you can find a control scheme that works for you.  I hope that you can.  It's great!!Happy gaming all."

So bascialy the game play has not changed from the original at all in that regard. It is a direct port from the original but, now in VR.  You are playing in the game and not just playing it.  It's pretty dang cool despite the old graphics and lame gun sounds.     I prefer running around with the D-pad instead of teleporting but the teleport option is there.   I guess the teleport feature is to make you run around in your real life room space but that just won't work in this game.  You need to be running...all the time... when the waves start hitting. It is hectic fun!    The d-pad control seems much more natural to FPS type games to me.    The game runs smooth and stable on my HTC Vive on in game ultra settings with Win10 on GTX1070 (8mb RAM)  intel i7-2600K @3.4Ghz w/ 12GB RAM.      I was being chased around the map looking all over while running forwards and shooting behind and to the sides at everthing that was chasing.  The dual weilding akimbo works great.  I was side stepping to circle strafe like the old days and ran circles around the bad guys blasting away!!   (I turned off rotation because it messed with the side step for me.)   I only played a little before I got wrapped up in my cables and pulled the usb cable out.    You will be spinning around shooting in all directions so figure out your cables or get wrapped up in them!    If you enjoyed playing this game on the flat monitor then I think you will love this in VR. Despite how old this game is, in VR it is superior to most of the modern VR early access, zombie wave shooter""demos""  available right now.    I don't get VR sickness or motion sickness but it take a minute or so for my mind to settle and comfortable in the game world.   You move quickly so some may want to stick to the teleport option.   I think the VR port makes the price point worth it. The game by itself is only worth a couple of dollars but the VR makes it feel like a new experience.    I just bought it on special for $29 but, it is a rehashed full title game for VR.   I am happy to pay the price to keep the VR devs going.   More ports please!!     This game has restored my faith in VR!!"

I frist time played Serious Sam the 2nd encounter in 2003 when I was still in college, the amazing graphic and weirdest stories deeply shocked me. I played  over and over again (online mutiplay has more fun!)By that time I had an ideal that wish someday the technology can be good enough make people go into the game. And this game would be the frist game I'd like to try!  After 14 years waiting , And now I GOT THE CHANCE!Also I've been play many many other steam games, But this is the frist review I ever writen on steam. Even other classic games like portal 2 or half life 2 never made me so excited want to write a review. But after tried this Serious Sam 2nd encounter VR game, I decide to write this review.1st of all: The game story no change, exactly like the orginal game, Croteam showing enough respect to the orginal one, That's the cool thing.2nd: In VR, I feel something new and different from the old version and HD, because I'm in the game, further understanding of the game has been sublimated .3rd: I'd say Serious Sam the 2nd encounter is the best VR game I ever played.So my suggestion: If you are an old Sam fan, don't ever never miss this VR game, if you don't have VR, you should start saving money now. Because one your get this VR game and tried, You will understand how I feel!"

It’s more fun than a bottle of hot sauce at an ulcer suffers convention and the developers made all the right choices with the VR implementation. If you have a VR setup up, give them your money.First off: Being able to pick between teleport and regular locomotion styles is fantastic for a VR game and it’s even more fantastic that you can actually move somewhere. I prefer classic locomotion over teleport simply to reinforce the realism whilst you blow up space demons with a hand-held rocket launcher and what not.  That said, while locomoting in the classic style on my system, the game engine does narrow the field of view a bit; presumably to keep the frame rate acceptable and thereby minimizing the need to redeposit your lunch in a bucket.  At first, I wasn’t sure about this choice. I was wondering why the design team just didn’t limit movement speed instead of FOV but then I remembered that I know exactly f&%* all about virtual reality game design and maybe I should give a try to what the competent folks who made this this had put together. After a few minutes, I grew accustomed to the tunnel vision effect during movement.  In fact, I grew to like it because it feels like you are concentrating on where you are going when you move. Kind of like you would if space demons were actually chasing you.  I found the FOV limit while moving adds a bit of reality to the game. Anyway. For me, the locomotion system worked. I’ve spent a few hours in the game so far in full locomotion mode with no disorientation at all and I came out with was a want to spend more time.Pros:Recaptures that ‘wow’ feeling you had playing your first FPSNot much plot to get in the way of the monster killing (Nod to Joe Bob )Rocket launcher on one arm, shotgun on the other because... why not.Puzzles look awesome in VR (crush rooms, run past poundy hallway blocks, etc.)Teleport / Classic locomotion options available.Cons:I need to stop playing. Work Tomorrow. Sleep. Need Sleep."

The game is rather intense, as it just keep pouring lots of enemies for you to kill with big weapons like chainsaw, rocket launcher, flame thrower, pistol and much more. As this was originally a traditional 2D title, it has a rather long, console-length gameplay time. If you are tired of short and experimental-ish VR title, buy this game NOW. Needless to say this is not a wave shooter, as you will be traveling from places to places. Croteam has offered a range of locomotion, allowing me to switch between teleportation or incremental movement at the same time.Jumping is done via the sidegrip, but that is rather clunky, as the original game was designed to move and jump at the same time. If there are jumping segments (eg platform), it is better to use the teleportation. Speaking of that, teleportation allows some form of cheating too, as it let you access a far distance teleportation. In areas like a long corridor with traps where you have to make a mad dash in the 2D version, you can bypass them by just teleporting to the other end.Play Serious Sam in VR is highly satisfying and fun, especially when the game let you dual wield different combination of weapons. You can have a flamethrower on one hand , and a rocket launcher in another. This allows me to perform various actions that is impossible in traditional version. I can have a weapon firing at the aerial enemies, and another weapon on the ground enemies, just for example. In another example, I can attack 2 entirely different direction, such as front and back. Again, impossible to be done in 2D version.I have played many VR titles, and Serious Sam VR is seriously (no pun intended) one of the best VR game, simply because of the satisfying feeling of killing them with those gigantic weapons."

I think every Vive owner owes it to him or herself to have one of these games.Full game, more locomotion options than you can poke a stick at, great performance and insane action/gunplay."
