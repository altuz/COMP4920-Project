This one has a different feel to it, a more professional feel to it. The voice acting is good, graphics are nice, the devs seem to be at work on an already nice game (coming along much better than most early access). Will keep updating review in the future."

Everything fits perfectly and i am eager to follow up on the story. For an EA this runs amazing and only found some minor bugs but nothing gamebreaking. Developers keep it up, really impressed me so far!!I will update this review on a later date as the game develops"
,Recommended,552880,32390689,Posted: 13 June,all,[KU]Dr.Dräscher,"Review as of June, 13thThe game looks, feels and sounds amazing, which creates an intense atmosphere without the usage of cheap jumpscares and the like. While you are out there exploring an abandoned space vessel you actuallyfeellike doing so. The voice acting is really good in my opinion and the voice actors sound like they were actually having fun doing it. There isn't much to say about the actual overarching plot of the game itself as it is still very early in development, but I can at least say it shows a lot of potential.I am sure it will turn out great."
76561198181900957,Recommended,552880,32358792,Posted: 11 June,all,Billy Hyde,"I like the premise - a salvage and rescue crew, unconcerned with the politics and intrigue of Space-Opera empires. Here, you're doing small, personal things against the backdrop of the galaxy - and that vastness serves to make them feel all the more important, and all the more yours. There's not much to go on just yet, but I got an optimistic feel from the game - although it might just be me. The thing the characters found the creepiest, I found noble and inspiring, so take that with a grain of salt. The developer of STARDROP has stated that in the form it is in right now, it's about 35% done - suggesting a game with a total length somewhere between 6 and 8 hours - maybe more, depending on the depth and challenge put into the subsequent chapters.  Personally, I'm happy to give the developer a few meals' worth of groceries or a few days' worth of utilities with my payment to see through the rest of it.PROS:- A reasonably-priced, mechanically-consistent independent adventure game.- A unique perspective from which to view a sci-fi story and setting.- A developer showing true care for both his creation and his audience.CONS:- Text-based entries could use some proofing, due to inconsistent form and some spelling/grammar errors.- Lighting has a bit too much glare, surfaces can be quite reflective.- I experienced some difficulty changing video settings, both in selection of choices and framerate after doing so."

I have never posted before but just had to, I like the game, it needs work but I knew that going in. I seem to be stuck unable to open a gate at a relay station even after all security protocols have been disabled, I even set off the alarm hoping to reset things but it did not help. Also It would be nice to be able to control the volume of the androids or at least have the Dev lower it, the woman's voice is quite nice but soft so I had to turn up the volume to hear but an android came up behind me while I was listening to dialog and started speaking, I just about jumped out of my chair. I read a post where it was said by the dev's and others that this was not a scary game, that is one of the reasons I purchased it.The game has GREAT potential and the Dev seems to be active with it so it seemed so far a safe bet. I look forward to more game updates and the improvements that hopefully will come."
,Recommended,552880,33410249,Posted: 9 July,all,SirRabbit,"I've only played a couple hours of this game, and from what I played I really enjoyed it. There are a few things that bugged me, but it being Early Access, I expect it will improve in future updates.Pros:- Enjoyable story line, with great voice acting- Exploration mechanics involve some thinking, you have to figure some things out on your own- Visually appealing (during gameplay)Cons:- Cut scenes / ship exteriors could do with some polishing. The ships look a bit too much like lego from the exterior.- You need to hit 'Q' to bring up your PDA as well as close it. Hitting 'Esc' to close it would be a much more natural option.- Currently, if you click ""New Game"" it doesn't prompt you with an ""Are you sure?"" option, and will wipe your save game data immediately.- The character runs out of breath waaaaaayyyy too quickly. This might be necessary for the pace of the story progression however.- During a spacewalk, the character moves SO SLOW. It gets a bit frustrating.I recommend this game, because of the enjoyable story line and the heavy involvement of the developers in the discussion forums. It seems like they're making great efforts to continually improve based on feedback they have received. I look forward to re-visiting this game after future updates."
,Recommended,552880,34275153,Posted: 16 August,all,Xautos,"STARDROPFor a casual experience within an exploration setting, Team V has created something different than most games. Based off a more modern Unreal engine, you are playing a character: Aryn Vance, she is sent out along with John Kindley who acts as pilot to the MCCV-2, a vehicle used to transport Aryn to missions and contact point during away missions to ship wrecks, abandoned vessels and more to come.As Aryn you are required to find out what happened to some ships or unravel a mystery to others.SettingBased in a space setting, the MCCV-2 is more than just a transport vehicle, it's also a home for two people while also acting as a rescue and retrieval ship. Most of the time you are onboard space vehicles and sometimes in a spacesuit. Sometimes you will encounter other lifeforms however these are not aggressive. Because it is set on space vehicles in trouble, it means passing by planets and stars along the way.What i like most about the setting is the dark hallways, the lifeforms and the general state of some ship systems, it gives that Alien like atmosphere to it without the horror aspect.GraphicsFor a small team of people with the unreal engine, i have say the Graphics are top notch, despite some lighting issues and a few areas that could be tidied up a little, for anyone coming to this game, it can be a pleasant surprise.AudioAt this point there isn't much in the way of music and the like, but there are enough noises from background objects like computers, cameras rotating and other things making noises. however it sets up the atmosphere perfectly.DevelopmentJoure And his team, Team V are working hard to produce this game in very good condition. Being that it is an early access game, getting as many people to help Team V work out the bugs and glitches that comes with such a game would be most welcome as well. Final note: Team V has just won an Intel Award, that by itself shows how good this game is."
76561198055690373,Recommended,552880,32162071,Posted: 3 June,all,issarevs,"This came out from nowhere...  Really fresh and intriguing take on this rather stale genre.  Loving it so far.  Stability is good for an early access, only crashed once (when examining an object)  Great unusually, calm atmosphere, but with intrigue. Really feels like in a real space universe.  Some dialog is really corny, but still works within the settings.  You can just walk around and enjoy the enorumous amount of work put into making this feel like you are out there in various space vessels.  (not to say there is nothing to do..., but no spoilers)  Wish the objectives were more vaired so far, though, with more twists.The sound and music are great.  From space music to Missisipi blues... in space :)  Just what I would put on if I was in space salvage :)Definitely work in progress, but everything seems to coming together well.  Wish many more objects were interactive.  Also the map should be able to zoom in and/or pan.  It only seems to be stuck on the small immediate area.  Makes it hard to navigate and explore little nooks and cranies.Love the 2 'scan modes'  Especially, the vision one.  Makes it nice and creepy!  A great mechanic to exploit, devs.Also, there seems to be a lot of lore and backstory (logs, terminals, etc...) which is great.The SRO (side quests you can take on) are a great idea geared for DLC and add-ons later on.Keep it up!  There is so much that can be done with this mechanic!"
76561197975735833,Recommended,552880,33558925,Posted: 15 July,all,captainradish,"This is one of the rare EA games that actually uses EA as it should. The devs did not dump a early Alpha monstrosity onto Steam in order to get more funding for it, no. Rather, this is somewhere around a late Alpha, early Beta stage where the game is playable and pretty well fleshed out already but needs tweaks.Visually, it is for the most part excellent. There are some issues with glare and over reflectiveness (which the devs have promised to work on) but everything is vibrant where it should be and dull where it should be. It does very much look like a space ship. It also is very well optimized. I experienced no jitters or lag whatsoever with everything maxed. It's not a particularly cutting edge engine, but it does the job well.I had a good time exploring the initial mission. You got juuust enough extra information to piece together what was going on, although I do wish there was an internal ""wiki"" of sorts. The characters knew what this semi-mystical Stardrop was, but the player is never told.All in all, this game shows much potential and for an EA game, it is very far along on its development path. It's clear the devs know what they are doing when putting together an exploration/adventure game. I look forward to seeing where it will go in the future."

Same goes for the graphics and the voice-acting.The developer is very active in the forum and listens to the players; for me, that's a great plus.I can recommend the game to everyone who likes SciFi with Story, but minus shooting or horror."
,Recommended,552880,34463308,Posted: 24 August,all,Hallelujah,"Writing this as of 24/08/17 - Game isn't finished but what i've played i've enjoyed, There are some bugs and QoL changes that areneeded to be resolved but overall it's quite an intrestesting story, i was expecting abit more on the side of Actually salvaging things in space etc before i started. It's got quite a creepy atmosphere atleast for the first few missions etc but it's not a horror game by any means,essentially you take on the roll of a women and her 'Friend'  who search for ships in space (or just take jobs from a notice board telling you where to go look for a ship etc), you are the one that goes exploring the ships and your partner talks to you via comms from the original ship.  Pretty standard puzzles at the moment, find data pads or bits of paper with codes to rooms  / computers.   Turn on power,  some minor elements of avoiding cameras (or just running past them quickly enough) and avoiding Androids. All in all i'm looking forward to seeing where this goes as the game continutes on.3.5/5 for now if it continutes the way it's going and intergrates some more puzzles and matybe some enviromental puzzles where you can interact with the enviroment abit more?   i could see myself givingin it 4-4.5/5"

It's mysterious and creepy but it doesn't scare the hell out of you. Yet, it's a one-playthrouth thing with the plot typical to this kind of games. If you've ever watched a sci-fi movie, you're quite experienced astronaut in the Stardrop universe. Yet again, don't expect lots of interaction or simulation, it's a visual novel in 3D after all."

The devs where right on it. Very polite and concerned with the glitches.So when early access was announced, i bought it. Then i talked some friends into trying it. Now we are hooked.it is early access so there are still small issues, But the devs are on it instantly. The story is not complete, but it is very good.Constantly releasing updates, They also listen to the players suggestions for game tweeks.Overall in my opinion, this is the best team of devs i have ever dealt with on a game.I love the game so i'm a little biased on writing a review.Good job Team V"

The initial copy I bought I refunded because of an issue (that turned out to be my laptop's issue, not the game). Playing it on my desktop it runs like a dream. Good framerates, smooth graphics, and well images. I hope the developers keep up with it and there are many more chapters :)."

Devs came through and knew you would and got to say im glad because im enjoying the game and havent run into any issues at all. Good job! One thing tho, when accessing the map on the pad she carries, are going to implement being able to move the map around to see where your going when its not in view from where your standing? This is helpful in other game so you can get an idea how far you have to go. Keep up the good work and looking forward to upcoming add ons to the game."

,Not Recommended,552880,34452583,Posted: 23 August,all,DarkMyth,At first I really like the idea of a repair and exploration game.  But after purchasing the game it's just very bland I feel like the puzzles should be a little more complex like when repairing it could have a little mini game that's something I've always liked from other games.  It's very slow pace and voice tirggers can be cut off by simply moving too quickly or going to another area.  Most of the other positive reviews made me try the game but it's just not for me not enough depth.
