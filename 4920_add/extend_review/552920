76561198021865536,Recommended,552920,33249644,Posted: 4 July,all,corsaire31,AS an old irl sailor and long time virtual sailing games player (Virtual Skipper) I highly recommend this simulation. Community starts to get things organized and we're having a ball during the races. To relax afterwards you can cruise anywhere around the world with the appropriate drink on your desk ! Already interesting in early access and no game breaking bugs. We have organized a four days race with 15 skippers and no technical problem.

(sleep, eat, log, charter, radio)- An equipment store (the ability to purchase rations, supplies, spare ropes) for Transat crossings, to maintain a system of energy and morale.- Some Major ports, with the ability to dock.As I have seen by the road map some of these suggestions are already planned by the dev, this title has so much to offer, in both potential and scope.It’s  a clear 7.5/10"

It has relegated every other game I own to the depths of Davy Jones' locker. I've never had any knowledge of sailing and therefore really a lack of interest I never knew could be there. Always been deep into aviation and flight simming. Now I'm consumed by sailing; reading sailing books and watching youtube-related videos both informative and entertaining in nature. Practically the whole ocean world is represented here which could provide a lifetime of cruising and exploring - and it's only in early access, giving this game so much room to grow. The boats will sail your set courses even while you're offline, simulating onboard crews - and you can operate the four so far offered independently of each other. This game is worth the money alone for the amount of educational content of sailing it teaches and allows you to interact with from the get-go, before even mentioning the opportunity to relax on trans-oceanic journeys through stunning sunsets and sunrises in calm and stormy sea alike. The engrossing beauty captured with the star-studded open-ocean night sky. Another added bonus to the game are the races, which are immersive and frequent. Each week a plethora of races are arranged by the devs and soon to be the community at large - they range from 24-30 hours in length, to 3 hour medium ones, to 30 minute short ones. The community here is second to none; the people you will meet, the joint adventures you'll have from day-to-day sailing, with the ability to multi-crew a boat anywhere in the world are all incredibly engaging and satisfying. I can't lavish enough praise on this game, I'm so glad I stumbled across it, and felt a strong enough desire to spend the money to experience it!"

76561197963545721,Recommended,552920,33361262,Posted: 7 July,all,Ceorl,"I've had Sailaway for just a week now, and I notice that I have racked up over 40 hours of in-world time already. That is a testament to the fact that I find this simulator totally captivating. If you are a sailor, or want to learn to be one, I have not found a better tool for learning or just enjoying seamanship.My personal interests are to improve my navigation and boat handling skills, plus exploring. Sailaway scores 10 out of 10 on those points. I am awed by the prospect of having all the oceans of the world to explore, including places I will probably never get to sail in RL, such as the passage at Tierra del Fuego or doing a circuit of Antarctica. I also enjoy practicing my RL voyages before I take them. The world model is good enough to imprint the geography of coastlines in your memory, and where there are modeled navigational aids, such as buoys or lights, that is even better.Actually the very first thing I checked when I loaded the game was a submerged rock I know, that I had slammed into with my keel in RL. When I found it existed in Sailaway too, I knew I was on to something good.I hope future development focuses on improving the simulation, rather than gamification. I would like to see more navigational aids, perhaps some coastal detail, and tides and currents.Perhaps a possibility would be to invite the community to assist by providing models at least of things like lighthouses, distinctive daymarkers or buoys. I myself have contributed several such to Google Earth, and I think many might be motivated to make similar contributions here.Massive kudos and thanks to the developers for producing the best piece of software I have used in a long time."
,Recommended,552920,31991966,Posted: 27 May,all,Ted,"I've been sailing 22-53 foot sail boats since I was a kid. I've looked at different boat/ship simulators for years, but never particularly bothered with any of them. I've sort of given up on simulating boats, let alone sailing. Then this indie release comes along! I've just finished my first hour of sailing, and I'm mighty impressed!You get that wonderful gratification when the sound (instantly recognizable) of the water and sails let you know that you've filled the sails properly. Constant fine tuning of the sheets, getting that cozy feeling when the tell tales point straight back - it feels authentic!The tutorials are great, and even though I've sailed short handed for 15 years, this simulator instantly convinced me I can practise my skills at home and actually have it improve my sailing in real life.Can't wait to see the progress of this title! Looking forward to having more people out on the water so that I can go amateur racing, or simply pair up for some recreational sailing. :)Easily worth the money, even though I can understand why non-sailors may think there's lacking detail when you get close to the shore. I'm sure that will improve. But if you respect the difficulties involved in making sailing simulation feel authentic, you will agree that the developer has focused on the most important core aspects of sailing, and you will certainly enjoy the game even at this early stage."
76561198016882199,Recommended,552920,32133491,Posted: 2 June,all,Hello Clitty,"I don't know what else to say about this game aside from the fact that I'm just grateful for it. For many years I've been scouring the web looking for a decent sailing simulator, and nothing really spoke to me. I'm a complete sailing beginner and wanted to use a sim as a means of learning the basics, and this game delivers. In a relatively short time I've learned quite a bit about the mechanics, and expect to continue learning. The tutorials are excellent, the community is friendly and helpful, and the potential is limitless. If you have any interest in sailing or the mariner life, don't miss out on this. This title is still in early access and it shows in certain spots, but I can't wait to see where it goes from here."
76561198028960295,Recommended,552920,32233293,Posted: 6 June,all,Kiwi Mace,One of the best examples of how an Early Access game should work.Whether you are a seasoned sailor or a novice this caters nicely to each.  You have the opportunity to either sail casually ANYWHERE in the world or do what I have done and take part in one of the many races on offer.A very friendly and helpful community along with developers that listen and implement suggestions mean an easy recommend from me.
76561197975609925,Recommended,552920,34722221,Posted: 3 September,all,jdmm72,"I love this simulator.  I personally sail smaller inland boats, but have learned a lot by desk sailing.  It's more than a game, it will help teach you sailing.  The higher difficulty settings allow the controls of a real boat (minus the mechanical failures and the pucker factor from them.)  I highly recommend it."
76561198035598014,Recommended,552920,33493238,Posted: 12 July,all,MJL34,"It is apparent that this game was created by a passionate sailor; someone who focused initially on the technical and experiential parts of real-life sailing that have rarely been replicated successfully in a virtual world. Yes, there are details such as land features and ports that would be nice touches down the line, but take a look at who are providing the most positive reviews ---- other sailors. I’ve never written a Steam review before, but I wanted to show support to this developer (my understanding is that this was a one-man operation for a while – Richard Knol?) and add to the other reviews to let him know that his work is not going unnoticed. Compared with other sim categories such as flying or driving, the sailing category has been long underserved. I remember an Americas Cup racing sim that lived for a while, but it had none of the complexity of this game. Beware – this is NOT a game for first-person shooter chaos or large-world fantasy – this is a real-time simulation that hopefully will continue to grow and be supported by a dedicated community. If you’ve been looking for a sailing sim – don’t hesitate. Highly recommend."
,Recommended,552920,31368550,Posted: 25 April,all,wolfbuzz,"In its current state, the game is solid and absolutely playable. If you like sailing, want to learn to sail, or lie somewhere inbetween, this game will satiate that desire. Having said that, the limited resolution options and some poor quality of life mecahnics will have you quickly realizing this is an early access game. I look forward to the development of this game."
76561198056760664,Recommended,552920,34140090,Posted: 9 August,all,SpeedyRetreat,"If you are on the fence about this game, jump over the fence! Its early access for sure, but let me tell you my story. I knew boats went on water. Port and starboard made sense to me (port and left are the same amount of letters). But beyond that, I had no sailing experience. I came into this thinking, neat! An open world sailing simulator. So I hopped in, floated my boat and sailed to places. I sailed online, but when I had to sleep, my phone updated me every time (you can edit the email timings) the wind changed or when I ran aground (frequently, plan your trips man!). It was fun, but I realized where early access is. There aren't any ports or docks yet, so getting to your location doesn't have any fanfare, you just sit next to a placeholder island. But I can see the potential. The wind is realtime, the time is... well, realtime. I teleported to ride out a hurricane, and a bunch of other players I dont know decided to join in too! It was crazy watching a bunch of nuts on sailboats tackling hurricane waves. And that right there is why you should buy it. The player base. I didnt want to get into racing. At all. And then I did and I cant stop. The people are amazingly helpful, the dev is working hard on it, and I have learned a lot. Where it lacks in real in depth tutorial, it makes up for in the community coming together. I know the difference between a genoa and a jib, I can tack, and if it's too windy out there, Ill reef my sail. A week ago, that would be gibberish to me. Now, it's my new online passion. Come on in, the waters fine! That was tacky... The game is amazing and is going nowhere but up."

I talk about it some more below, but I really urge anyone reading this review, or thinking of purchasing Sailway, or have Sailaway and just reading the reviews, if you are at all interested in racing, its such a great feature in this Sim. There are several short races that take an hour or less to complete, though I'm not finding many sailors participating. Still, the game is so new in its development, I expect that will change as time goes by. If anyone wants to race, just look for me (rich100211) I'm always willing when I'm in the Sim.Wow, really loving this simulator/game. I grew up doing a lot of sailing, and some racing. The sounds, graphics, physics really make me feel at times I'm on a real boat.I'm hoping Sailaway can gain a strong online community, as that will be a key to its success, I think.What I'm really excited about, and I hope the developers will really emphasize, is the racing features. The game (early access as I write this review) has several different race scenerios, and you can teleport to the starting line.What's really cool about this is they start hourly, and run 24/7. Some are for beginners, where sail position is adjusted automatically, so you can just focus on strategy, and other races feature more advanced mode where you will have to adjust your sails in addition to thinking strategy in the position of your boat. Oh, and by the way, these hourly races typically take around 45 minutes or so to complete, which makes it ideal for those who might have jobs?In summary, the sights, sounds, physics, the feel of the boats, really make me feel (almost) that its the real thing.And again and lastly, its the racing features that for me will be key to the longetivity value of this simulator."

76561198067441297,Recommended,552920,34768052,Posted: 5 September,all,jimcodlin,"I have been an FSX flight simulator enthusiast for more than 10 years and Train Simulator for 5 years.  I have always been interested in sailing and in past years tried 3 sailing simulators, all of which were bad to awful.  I decided to give this sim a try.  I was immediately impressed with the graphics in calm water. The realism of simulating the standing and running rigging, management of the sheets and sails is extraordinary.  I am amazed at how well it reproduces the experience of sailing. However, I was disappointed in the graphics  in ""bad"" weather. In mid Atlantic heavy seas, the graphics seemed really primative, not at all realistic.  Today I had my boat on a track I set  a week ago with no idea Hurricane Irma would be in my path.  I was shocked as the graphics came on screen, showing detailed enormous waves, wind-driven spray, foam on the waves--exactly as I believe it would look if I were at sea. I'm still struggling a bit with setting new sailing tracks and teleporting, but I hope the updated tutorials that I saw were part of today's update will help me.  I highl recommend this sim for sailing enthusiasts."

If sailing is in your blood, or if you want to find out if it is, then get in on the ground floor of this game.  The structure is brilliant.  The experience is real.  I live on water and this sim shows me the same sky I see outside my window, every day.  I dock my cyber boat at my rl home.  Did I mention the night sky and built in constellation map?"
76561198064483429,Recommended,552920,31641757,Posted: 9 May,all,Jayd,"Firstly, this is an early access game, and it's still in very early alpha. The development team is one (very clever) programmer. I mention this so people know the risks and that development will be slow, and the game sometimes buggy. Kerbal took a decade to get where it is now, after all.Secondly, this is a realtime and realistic simulation. There is no altering the time of day, there is no sailing at 500 knots (although you can telepot your boat), there are no AI ships to race against, there is no downloading the content. An active internet connect is needed. FPS players might be bored, until they realise how good sailing is.Thirdly it is first person, and there are no avatars. You can have crew on your ship, and friends who buy the game can join you, and you can talk but you won't see them.This is not a game for sightseeing, you don't really sail to admire the generic landscape. This is a game for sailing, as close to possible to as real life as can be simulated. Thousands of miles of rolling ocean waves, storms, gusting winds, the spray of water in your face, bad weather, sea sickness and all the other joys of sailing.Perfect for anyone who already sails, or people who are very keen on sailing. Your ship sails the seven seas and oceans of the world *in realtime*, it could take a year or more to sail around the world if  you are game to try.The game is linked to the NOAA data feeds so you experience the actual real wave period and depth, windspeed and direction, plus the time of day of your ships position - as if you were really there.Easy enough for a beginner, the game also offers a good challenge for the advanced sailor. I've also found on most fine days this is also a great game to have next to you all day long as you do other things - just watch it every now and again to make sure your ship is on course and your sails trimmed.The online community is nice, friendly people with a lot of combined sailing knowledge. They are not the normal grumpy and complaining people seen in other games.I recommend it, but please be very sure of those points I made before."
,Not Recommended,552920,35437946,Posted: 3 October,all,Xiaphias,"Great to learn sailing, probably, but not very exciting.  Doesn't seem like it's possible to capsize or damage the boat (the tutorial mentions that ""gybing"" can snap off the mast in fast enough wind but I tried it in the strongest winds on earth right now and nothing happened).  Not very exciting visually, couldn't find any crazy storms or anything, even the worst storm still had sunlight and was pretty meh-worthy, especially given the aforementioned inability to capsize.  Running aground is not exciting either, you just get a popup saying ""help me"" and your boat resets off the coast.  No human constructions (cities, NPC traffic) or other landmarks (like the Golden Gate Bridge).That said, the sailing AI is pretty cool, it's neat to put it in auto-trim and watch it move the ropes around.  It explains why it's doing this, to a degree (""raising jib line to 40% to open top sail"" or whatever).  However I wanted to watch this from an angle where I could actually see the sail moving, and that didn't seem to be possible: I couldn't find a good vantage point on the boat, and if you position the camera in an off-the-boat ""3rd person"" angle that shows the sails then the auto-trim button no longer works.  So all I really got to see most of the time was the rope (""line"") moving in or out as the AI made their adjustments.In conclusion, this is the best and onlyest sailing simulator I've played, and if you enjoy playing flight simulators for long-haul flights over the ocean in realtime then you may enjoy this game also.  If you have the patience it will doubtless teach you a lot about sailing, and the tutorials are somewhat helpful in that sense as well.  But it's not so much a game as it is a simulator, and I suspect it's not something the average consumer will enjoy.  The addition of real hazards or goals (e.g. transporting passengers to raise money to purchase better boats) could possibly change this in the future, but as it stands I would not recommend this to anyone who is not specifically seeking a sailing simulation program for educational purposes."

Although it is in early development, It still exceeds all sims ive ever played. However,  I think there are a few things that could make it better.1. Being able to look around while pulling lines (maybe middle mouse button?)2. having more hotkeys (trimming the jib, pulling halyards, such like that)3. even better, being able to have your own hotkeys and plan them out4.(i know everybody else says this, but) MORE BOATS( I would really like a sailboard, look it up)5. I know it may not be possible, but if you could have like a singleplayer editor where you could make your own weather and things like that. it would be fantastic.6. Know youre focusing on the actual ocean part, but if in the future you could put in more lakes, that would be great.That's all I have to say. I'm not sure if the devs will see this, but if they implement this, it will be my game of the year."
,Recommended,552920,31390317,Posted: 27 April,all,Dablin,"It's needs to be known that I am in no way a sailor, atleast not in real life. The closest I've ever gotten is windsurfing and admittingly that was quite few years ago now.I am though extremely impressed by this game, and overwhelmed to be honest. Much like most simulators there is a reasonably steep learning curve for those brand new to it, but I for one enjoy a challenge. There is a great sense of peace when playing this game. Listening to music whilst sailing the open ocean, trying to find out an ounce of a clue as what I am supposed to do to manage the sails and before I know it 5+ hours have gone by.It isn't perfect, it is a bit glitchy at times, and there are obvious issues and quality of life features missing, but this is to be expected for an early access game. There is a great deal of potential in Sailaway, I am glad I stumbled across it when I did.As of now, the first update has just rolled out, the resolution bug affecting quite a few people including myself appears to now be fixed. The devs seem to be paying close attention to all the feedback and I can't wait for what they provide in the near future with further updates."

Until we can afford our own sailboat to go cruising with.... this will keep you plenty busy and keep the dream alive. It is very educational in learning basic and advanced sailing with the lines/sails. It's open world and people are looking for others to sail with constantly. I also like how there are many events for racing, etc in different areas. Sails while you're offline as well so you don't need to stare at a screen for a week.Fair Winds and Following Seas!"

,Recommended,552920,33037415,Posted: 30 June,all,jayinatlanta,"I recommend this game and I'm glad I bought it. You should prioritize getting it as one of your next purchases, if you have the money to spend. It's far cheaper than real sailing and very realistic.The game impressively implements real-time sailing in any part of any ocean, plus the great lakes and some other large bodies of water. You can easily and instantly teleport to anywhere in those locations. You can sail with near-zero effort (a couple keys/mouse), or maximum realism by manipulating all the lines and sails, or the boat can sail itself and you can relax. However, here are some facts:- planning an actual journey between two places, with waypoints, is much more difficult; the community and developers know the interface needs to be more user-friendly- the game uses real-world time zones in real time. So if you pick a place where it's night-time, it will be pitch black except for the night sky; adding running lights or an on-board lantern/flashlight would be preferable.Here are some things that are only slightly negative and may change:- coastlines have no detail and no lights (for the most part). some random buildings would be nice, along with random coast lights at night- sea-life needs to be added to increase the sounds you hear and sights you see in the vast, open oceanAnd here is my personal request: implement more large lakes in the US and elsewhere. Almost every state/province/small country has a body of water big enough that real-time sailing would provide hours of fun, with fewer enormous choppy waves. I can't repeat enough that the game is real-time with all the pros & cons that brings. Therefore, using your sailing skills on a lake would be more realistic and fun when you only have an hour or so to spare, than going on an ocean voyage where your auto-pilot does most of the work."

I hope the devs add more yachts, but loving it so far...especially the Minitransat as I'm about to buy one in real life.Good graphics and definitely helpful to learn sailing.

If you're into sailing and are unable to afford a boat, or are physically unable to manage a boat, then this is definitely the next best thing. I also love the fact that the weather and sea conditions change according to real-world data, and also the fact that you can dip into the game as little or as much as you like and your boat will keep sailing, although I'm not sure what happens when you run into a storm and you're not at the helm. All in all the best sailing game I've played.This is an update to the very basic early review I made. There have been many improvements since I wrote this review, namely with how my intel chip handles some graphical issues (namely that the boat was sinking beneath the waves, now it doesn't, which is excellent), and with problems I, and others, were having sailing the mini transat. These changes have already changed a great game into an exceptional one, and I, for one, cannot wait to see what additions will be made to this fantastic, unbelievably good game, in the future."

But if you like sailing and want to sail all over the world and test yourself then try this. Real Time waether is implimented and together with tools likewww.windy.comthe game really comes to life! Sail the storms or chill out on a lake, it's all your own choice and freedom of movement. do you want to sail the journeys of our great historic sailors like Columbus, Magellhaan or Cook? Just recreate them and sail the routes solo, or with a crew!Or race together with other players, the community is growing and very friendly, there is allways someone to help you out, or just ask him to teach you how to sail, it's possible!

I have many a bad sailing games before and at long last this game has actual potental.Sailaway is definitely a bit rough around the edges, a little buggy, a slightly awkward UI, fairly primitive racing, and land masses that look straight out of the early 90s, BUT as an early access game its enduring to see that the things that really matter are already rock solid. The boats are gorgeous, wind and water mechanics are realistic, and sail shape is everything.Oh, and did I mention the real world weather?! Do you know how cool it is to check real world wind reports to find your ideal spot in the game??? You don't now, but you could....If you had ever been interested in a serious sailing simulator, I wouldn't hesitate to pick this one up."

,Recommended,552920,32529791,Posted: 18 June,all,Napoleon Bonaparte,"I have an interest in sailing and bought this game as a way to familiarize myself with sailing and its basic concepts. I am 5 hours in and while I understand that is not a lot of time, I have scratched the surface and would like to give a perspective of a beginner. The tutorials aren't the best that I've experienced as they tend to throw a lot of information at you all at once, however they do give you the most basic concepts of sailing and allow you to start sailing on your own, once you start sailing you will receive tips on how to adjust the sails all the way up to advanced mode. There is an ""auto-sail"" option that gives you only the power to steer the ship. The game is online 100% of the time, once you start the game you are launched straight to your sailboat which keeps sailing whether you are online or offline (unless you anchor). There are auto-navigation options which keep your boat on the proper path to continue your voyage. You will receive e-mails with information on your ships heading, speed, etc.Overall I have enjoyed this game so far, keep in mind that it is EA and there are minor bugs and glitches.My only major complaint is the fact that the speech filter is EXTREMELY restrictive. It is like the gestapo on steroids, words like ""hell"" and ""stupid"" will get you banned. The developers say that they want the chat to remain ""safe"" and ""friendly"" but I see the speech restriction as over the top and unnecessary."

,Not Recommended,552920,35484939,Posted: 4 October,all,zylime,"I live in Boston and sailing is a hobby of mine (in real life). This simulator is pretty much unplayable to me. While you are in the boat, your point of view is rididly attached to the boat, meaning that when the boat heels, the horizon gets tilted. This is extremely unnatural, and after a while it actually made me kinda nauseous. In real life, you have the feeling of gravity to keep your head upright - it is instinctual in real life that the horizon will be level to your eyes no matter how much the boat heels.Someone in the forums said that the creators intend you to tilt your head in real life to keep the simulated horizon level as the boat heels, but I really hope they aren't serious. It is very uncomfortable to keep level a simulated horizon when it disagrees with the gravity that you feel in real life. Furthermore, by tilting the horizon on screen, you lose a lot of space that could otherwise hold more visual information.The view angles overall feel very wonky. I find it slightly frustrating that the tell tales are completely out of view when I am adjusting the sail trim.I am considering trying to get a refund for this game, but I am conflicted. The effect of sail trim seems really accurate and the waves are really well done. I desperately want them to succeed in making this a great sailing simulator, and I see great potential here. But right now the horizon problem undermines the whole experience."

,Recommended,552920,31805686,Posted: 17 May,all,Limmin,"What A Feeling!This sim captures so much of the special essence of sailing.  There are visceral elements involved, whether racing or cruising:  a tilted deck, pitching and rolling, interaction between wind and waves.Here's one that sailors will instictively remember:  You're on a broad reach, heeling a bit, creating the usual hull wave, moving at say 7 kts in your 38 foot ocean cruiser.  Then you quickly turn downwind.  The boat...and horizon...level out with a WHOOSH of waterline spray, the wind noise drops down, and the wave you had been pushing along moves off...then the following wave picks you up; after pitching backwards for a couple of moments you gently pitch forward...then back.  A very visceral feeling.  I'm describing the game right now.If you're a sailor, you'll definitely want to give this one a try.  For non-sailors, there's enough detailed tutorials and hints to start you sailing immediately.  You can't go wrong; the in-game boats are keelboats and cannot capsize.  If the winds get too big, you just heel over until everything is in balance.  (You can also reef the sails of course.)Before I ""took the plunge"" and purchased this great (soon to be legendary) sim, I was concerned about the few things it maybe could not do.  Now, I'm more amazed by the things it does well already:1.  Smooth, largely issue-free gameplay2.  Persistent world.  Exit game, your boat keeps going on the course you set, or even follows the waypoints you set down3.  Wind and wave dynamics4.  Realistic weather, based (I think) on current conditions worldwide.5. And social interactions!  You can for instance teleport your boat alongside anyone else and have a casual chat, meet fellow sailors from around the world.  You can even chat with sailors on the other side of the world and compare notes on current conditions.Even though this game is in early access, it does everything I've described seamlessly.  Much kudos to the dev(s)!"

If youare wanting to learn how boats work It's the only sim you should be buying. It will explain mostly whateverything is.The boats feel too stable for my liking but I hear it's been worked on, broad reached and getting zero rollas I'm sure a lot of other sailors have noticed is a bit off putting. Modelling of the boat and graphics are acceptable, landwas messed up in this last patch but again will be sorted out.Reefing... It's just not realisitic, but take in mind the game is very early. So in so many cases I would reef in real life force 4 I want to be second reefed, I don't want to lose 3 knots reefing when I should be doing 6-8 still and full main and genoa out shouldn't be faster with that heel but it is. Other cases running in a force 5-6 3rd reefed doing 0.5 over ground doesn't make me feel like I am there.Seas are a little too fast, never spend so much time on the crest of a wave in a force 3 also they are a little big in my view...I would like to see tides, maybe the nav map changed to real admiralty charts and been able to see buoys more easy with out having to zoom so much in the map. How it's fully online is great, people are friendly and a lot wanting to learn and willing to help people also learn.All that said it's early access and it's already a fantastic game and anyone wanting to learn to ropes (intended xD) this is the sim for you."

Add to which, RL winds and currents and the full globe to explore, with accurate day and night patterns (which can suck at times if you get off late and cruising near your own timezone)With that being said, would be great to see more things, continued community improvements - (social and schooling) , AI craft when hitting shipping lanes or ports), cruising motors for when there is no wind, and the periodic (f*ck, something just went wrong on the sailboat). Maybe some other boats like Hobies, or basic sailboats, to much larger scaled ships that would require a larger crew. And maybe some basic models for players (and the position they are in).And lets not forget port fees, passports, Visa's and all the other stuff that happens when sailing from port to port.

It's always fun seeing another boat sail with/by you. The ambient sound is really immersive and is a very big game changer. The maxiumum and even minimum graphics are really nice.

76561198029903975,Not Recommended,552920,35480562,Posted: 4 October,all,SugarySnax,"Simulators are designed by adults who don't remember what fun was. Its been hammered into them that learning is fun so they think they're giving people a great time when they make a game that requires study and the learning of arcane terminology as in sailing.  I am not against learning, but I like fun too. Sometimes I'll find it in a simulator even though the designers have done their best to keep that childish thing out of their simulation. Unfortunately, Sailaway is not one of those sims.Okay, I watched the tutorials a couple of times and I struggled through the stuff about lines and sails. It was somewhat informative. I got my boat moving along and my telltails sometimes have their tails horizantal on both sides of the sail and at the top and the bottom. I can see where it might be something to know which sail to use and which rope, I mean line to tighten or loosen, but I can just leave things where they are for many hours. There isn't much of anything to do.The waves are different everywhere, but they're not that amazing. Surprisingly, I can't crank up a huge storm and test my boat out. I have to find real weather. If there are no Irma's or Jose's in the world at the time, I'm stuck with whatever there is. Isn't it obvious that I might want to crank things up and smash up my boat in a horrible storm? Isn't that what games and computers are for, to do things we can't do in real life? Sure, have the real weather, but also offer the option of creating the weather. Its not like bigger waves and high winds cost more money. Its not like I can't just restart with a brand new, even more expensive boat.When I play a game like GTA Vice City, I enjoy the waves and I always think, it'd be great to sail these boats the way real sailboats work.  I'd like the weather to change, but there needs to be more. Shouldn't there be tons of quick races available through those magic hoops that all kinds of games use. That'd be nice, expected even. (maybe I just haven't found them). It would be nice if we had to find something, maybe some sailors with a broken mast or find a missing airliner by it's transponder. There's nothing like that.In Sailaway, for the most part you can't see your sails going up and down and having this or that tightened while looking at the thing your working on. Your view is mostly restricted to the line you're pulling on and that's annoying. It also ramps up the frustration level. You think if I weree on the boat, I'd grab the rope and look at the sail as it went up and down or the tail pulled in closer or whatever. I wouldn't look at the damn rope. You just know you're in the early years of gaming when you see something like that. The tip boxes blink on and off as the boat rocks. The bars on the various info screens are exceedingly thin and hard to grab hold of when you want to scroll a screen and the middle mouse scroll is so slow even when its cranked all the way up. The tutorial doesn't draw your attention to things expertly and there isn't a way to go over something again without watching a bunch of long, boring videos.You'll be impressed though with the lines. The controls on the boats are, as far as I know, all there. Its more sophisticated than anything else I've seen. There are all kinds of settings for putting your boat under auto pilot but I'm never sure if they're working and neither is the game from what I've seen.I was going to get a refund, but I used up my two hours on the tutorial vids which I should have watched on youtube. I had to play a few more minutes to find some weather and so now I own the game. Bottom line is the game is amazing, but tedious to learn and boring after a couple of hours. There's nothing to do but race or go in a straight line.  As far as chatting goes, people are nice but there aren't that many people in there right now. There will probably be even fewer as time goes on and people go looking for something that's fun and engaging.Make your sims fun and engaging, gamemakers. People should be thinking, wow, I love the way I can steer with one hand and grab the halyard and pull while looking at the sail and then the sunset. Its like I'm there. (Sometimes it can be satisfying to reach a level of skill in a clunky game where it feels like you are doing that)"

As far as the boats go, they are realistic (to a landlubber like me they are!) and I managed to get to advanced level of sailing within a few hours of play. I liked the map/gps/trim facility and the offline aspect of the sim and email notifications are a nice touch. But I`m afraid that I just cannot get enthused about this at this present time.I know that this is still EA but I have to agree with other reviews that maybe there should be a bit more for £26.99 than a boat , sea, sky and some `lumpy green stuff`. I will, nevertheless, follow Sailaway and see what the future brings."

The water graphics look about 15 years old, games like Naval Action and Silent Hunter 5 are light-years ahead.  Its pretty early in development so maybe in a few years it will amount to something.  Needs more boats, more activities.  You sail around until you get bored.  Its not terrible but wait for a sale.  Not worth what they charge for such an early dev product."

I'd say you'd probably need to have at least some interest in sailing to enjoy this game, otherwise you might find it kind of boring. I sailed a few years ago and the tutorials really helped me refresh my memory. They are well designed. I find this game so entrancing and calming. Looking forward to giving racing a try but still learning the ropes..."

Night is rolling in and out my window I see a front coming in in the real world. Cant see that from my boat yet but I dont know what the cuurent temperature is, I have no running lights and no nav lights to turn and Im planning to nav through the shipping lanes into Cape Town harbour yacht basin. Im loving this I see the awesomeness in potential, lets hope it gets there. Yes I'm going to give it a thumbs up but I'm doing it in good faith that great things lie ahead. The bare bones are here, its true you can sail the world but if flight sim can be a 'real SIM' this better become one otherwise weve all been robbed. At this stage though, its not much of a sim. I say that in total respect of early access and in honor of the size of the potential I see. meanwhile I've far from exhausted what I still wanna do right now, - hoping for modelled harbours, true to life shorelines and all the other goodies I'm sure Im not alone in hoping for."

,Recommended,552920,34078769,Posted: 7 August,all,Alymon,"This is a game I wanted to like, but it's just not for me. Maybe when it is complete I'll change my mind, but for now I am done with it.  However, there's a lot of good here. The level of detail is awesome. The tutorials, while not very reinforcing of the material, at least explain everything to you. And the difficulty level is fully customizable to allow a novice sailor or an experienced pro to find a happy place. There's something beautiful about sailing at night under the stars or watching the sun go down over the horizon.Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any city/port modeling currently (at least where I looked: New York City, Italy). This makes it hard for me to enjoy. It's hard for me to get excited about sailing along a coastline when there's nothing there to see. Given it is early access, that may be coming in a future update.The game is multiplayer. You can see other ships on the map and presumably run into them. You can also join other sailors on their boats and sail together.The foundation is here. And if you are a big sim fan, you'll probably enjoy this one. If you are a little less enthusiastic about hours of sailing a boat, you may want to wait until the game has a bit more content and detail in the world."

You should defenetly choose the tutorial, otherwise you may hit shallow waters all the time. ...as some of us may have...Details of this full online world are amazing, from real-world time and weather data up to adjustable ships and else. At least the EA needs some more stuff to get into the game, like landscapes, ports or even ship lights, but I have no doubt the devs are working hard to get all ideas in, we like to see. It is your personal choice, wheather to leave sailormanship to the AI or take all aspects in your very own hands. It's a learning process. In my case I left it to the AI and concentrated on steering and routing for now. Next I try to learn reafing sails by hand...The online community is very active and friendly. You allways find somone to chat or to ask some questions. You are also able to sail together in regattas, just for fun and even together on one boat.So, if you don't mind, my boat is waiting for next journey."
76561197986610134,Recommended,552920,34122554,Posted: 9 August,all,Vomov,"It holds a lot of potential, but is still quite unfinished. The effects of water and wind are partially modeled, boat movement is fluid and mostly realistic, but the sails behave 'choppy' from time to time, and certain details aren't smooth.The boats look awesome, and the depth of field adds quite a bit, but somehow selecting the proper ropes and such is unintuitive and a bit hit-and-miss. Also, you cannot look around while working on a rope, meaning you cannot see the effects of manipulating tension of the sails, for example."

This simulator has the potential to be on par with x-plane 11 which I also own.  Would also be great if you can also do the interior models as well.  I know this is still in its early stages, but if you keep this up it will be an amazing sailing simulator..hell it might be the sailing sim for educational/training purposes as well.  All in all, amazing sim!!"

76561198170956395,Recommended,552920,35506627,Posted: 5 October,all,Faze_Ceilingfan,"At, first, I was pretty on edge about buying this game since it is fairly expensive for an early access indie game, but it looked nice so I decided to just go for it. I'm glad I did. I've loved the peaceful and calming atmosphere of a beautiful calm day on the water and the intese situation of a windy thunderstorm. There are true physics at play here when it comes to the way the wind blows and how the boats and sails react to the wind. What I find most interesting about this game is the fact that the developer has taken the time to model out the entire world's oceans, which shows serious dedication. There are no real land details or landmarks (Cities, bridges, etc) yet, but I hope they will add that soon, and the land seems a bit rough and low quality. So far there are 5 very well-modeled boats implemented, and most likely more are planned. I wasn't even into sailing until I tried out this game, so I reccomend it whether you are into sailing or not.Rating: 8/10"
