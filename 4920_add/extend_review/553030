Everything is well designed, smooth and functional. The soundtrack is very repetitive (kind of understatement): it looks like this is a key design choice for free games (remember Candy Crush Saga's ""soundtrack""?).And this is where the ""free"" keyword rings a bell: free, in some cases, means ""pay to win"". You can probably win this game by grinding a lot. Or the game could be offered for a moderate price ($4-7). No, it is >designed< to may you purchase gems or potions (and of course, price of items would make the price to win a lot more than the game is worth).As a pay2win, I would rate it positively. However, I am a consumer here and as such, I can't recommend a game whose intent is to turn you in an addict.SuNo"

It has nice art and song. The design and the animation of the characters, enemies, and the other things are really good.But unfortunately it has some lacks:The way how the blocks pop up is kinda frustrating and weird, they can suddenly block the way which you have createdand it will bring disasater as you can't combine the other blocks and easily to be killed.The amount of money you get depends on how lucky and how many Gold tiles you get in a dungeon. The upgrade is expensive, so you need to play same stage repetitively.The multiplier which you get (especially the 200% one) also kinda weird and don't understand about the calculation.Gives a constant 80 - 100 damage, not all of them give that multiplier. Is it has a chance or formulation? Don't know because it is not said in the tutorial.As it says on the title and the tag, but there's no single element of RPG and tales on the game.Time killer game? Yes, but not really good for a serious player.Sorry to say, not recommended."
,Recommended,553030,29538926,Posted: 28 January,all,Apostol Apostolov,"We entitled PC gamers are fast to circle jerk any F2P mobile port that graces our Master Race platform Steam, but it is rare when a really good, really well done mobile puzzle RPG dares to and it totally deserves a positive review.Tiles & Tales is a puzzle RPG based around the board-sliding mechanics of cult hit among bored developers, 2048. It swaps the exponential difficulty for multiple color tiles, regular board-cleanup through attacks, opening treasure, healing and whatnot. You need to collect enough Mana to open a portal to win the level, and better you are at stacking numbers, the faster you can beat the level before you're exhausted by taken damage. It's much easier than 2048 but that opens it up to a broader audience.Tiles & Tales has relatively engaging game loop - there're multiple upgrades, daily and weekly quests, and very generous free hard currency (a.k.a. gems) gifts every 4 hours. Given that first respawn in a failed level costs only 1 gem, and a 4-hour free chest contains 3-7 gems, this is a very generous, soft-paywall game. There are premium characters, but even the most expensive takes 15-20 days play for free (only running game to get your free gems). I hope authors have enough revenue to cover for the Steam port, but the game as it is too generous, maybe unsustainingly so.Some people complain that it costs LOTS of coins to upgrade, forcing you to pay, but the game actually rewards skill (or luck?) by stacking coin tiles up to 9,999. I was able to achieve such a luck run around Level 14. It shot me 5-6 upgrades further in the game, making it very easy. It definitely is not ""PAY or GTFO"" game.PROS* Great visuals for mobile title, at par with Zynga and King.* Engaging, addictive puzzle RPG mechanic.* Okay upgrade system.* Daily, weekly quests, timed gifts reward retention well.CONS* Very few uses for hard currency (a.k.a. gems)* Very few permanent purchases for hard currency"
,Not Recommended,553030,29496475,Posted: 25 January,all,<™[-=> Cookiez <=-]™>,"Tiles and Tales is a mix between 2048 and Match 3. The objective of the game is to go through each level collecting a specified number of Blue Crystals. You use the arrow keys or WASD keys to move the blocks in a similar pattern in 2048. Blocks of the same colour combine with one another and go up in value. At the end of the round, the required coloured block with the highest value is broken and used.Red blocks deal attack damage to enemies at the end of round, green blocks heal you at shrines, purple blocks unlock chests, coin blocks give you coins and so on. You can use coins to buy passive skills that can aid you in game. You can also buy potions that give you temporary buffs.Conclusion, I think this game should not be on Steam. It's better suited for Facebook or a mobile platform and I don't think it's a good idea to encourage more of these games to port over to Steam. The Pay To Win system is also a major no-no. The cash currency in this game is called Diamonds. Best price was 7000 Diamonds for $140.PROS1. Decent GameIt's playable.2. HeroesSome variety at least.CONS1. Another Click-and-Slide GameWhile I like these games, I don't think they belong on Steam.2. Pay To WinYou can use cash to buy more coins, which turn into upgrades, which turn into a gameplay advantage, which is Pay To Win.3. Scripted/Random Blocks AppearingNo way to predict what colour block will appear where on the grid. Either it's scripted or totally random. The game can spawn different coloured blocks just to block you for no reason other than to frustrate you and force you to pony up cash.4. RPG?Where is the tale in Tiles & Tales?"

I just don't have the desire to find out."

,Not Recommended,553030,29574806,Posted: 29 January,all,DCxDemo,Boring 2048 wrapped in generic fantasy design. They were so lazy they didn't even adopt it to landscape orientation. You don't need this one.

,Recommended,553030,29503569,Posted: 26 January,all,Kodyd194,"In Tiles & Tales you have to slide the different block types into each other to grow the number inside the block. This can be used to accomplish the tasks in combat from healing to attacking, and even unlocking loot crates. Its simple gameplay but I havent seen anything like this on Steam yet, and I enjoy it enough so I am recommending it. Tiles & Tales  plays similar to some other games you can find on Mobile."

I also noticed it's being compared to a game that I personally haven't played, so I'm not judging it according to how similar it is. For me, I like it and it's pretty addictive. Great job!
