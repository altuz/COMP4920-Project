,Recommended,553210,29994263,Posted: 17 February,all,Polite People,"This is a Steam adaptation of a brilliant mobile game developed by Herocraft. The game natively supports a wide variaty of languages such as all major European ones, Russian and even three Asian languages, which is a huge plus.For now 'Space Wolf' is in the Early Access stage, but you can already experience the addictive mechanics of tactical card combat, where you can equip some cards cards and use others to attack, activate a special ability or even just move, etc.I've only played a couple of early campaign mission so far, and they are nothing like the ones in the mobile verison of the game. PC can handle much bigger and more complex maps with a bigger amount of enemies, so the game feels fresh even for the mobile version veterans.There are three classes of characters available - spacemarines, terminators and scouts, each with a unique weapons and special abilities.The graphics are nothing to write home about but look pretty solid and is able to depict a fierce battles of Space Wolves against Chaos space marines. Attention - when you first start the game graphics settings are set on low, make sure you turn it all the way up in the Settings menu.I for one decided to back this interesting project and see where it is going, especially since the price is so low.Это Steam-версия мобильной игры от русских разработчиков Herocraft из Калининграда, поэтому игра сразу поддерживает русский язык, а также все европейские и азиатские языки.Пока ""Space Wolf"" в раннем доступе, но уже сейчас можно опробовать цепляющую механику тактических карточных боёв, где карты экипируются, используются для атаки, активации способности или просто передвижения и т.д.Пока попробовал только первые миссии кампании и уже заметил, что они совершенно не такие, как в мобильной версии. Компьютер позволяет использовать большие и сложные арены с множеством врагов на экране одновременно.Доступны три класса воинов - космодесантники, терминаторы и скауты, у всех разное вооружение и способности.Графика звёзд с неба не хватает, но выглядит вполне неплохо и отлично передаёт картину жестоких сражений Космических Волков против космодесанта Хаоса. Внимание, при первом запуске игры стоит самая низкая графика, надо включить высокую графику в настройках.Лично я принял решение поддержать многообещающий проект от наших разработчиков, тем более что цена вполне антикризисная."

You feel power of every weapon due it's effects on enemies and particle effects even on environments hits, very satisfying. walking, ruining and melee attacks are great animated and you always feel how heavy and powerful space wolf is. I tough it would be easier, like you are unstoppable force going trough waves of enemies like hot knife trough butter but it actually quite challenging, sometimes frustrating but also satisfying. Overall quite good game, almost no side activities like collecting useless things and looking for secrets in every corners, there are servo skulls/ audio logs but other than that you just push forward and mark you way with blood of heretics :)For the Imperator! :)"
,Recommended,553210,33797048,Posted: 25 July,all,Sir Papercut,"A reasonably solid 40k game. Using tactical cards to throw weapons at Chaos forces, you slowly progress through a variety of missions.Card rates here are MUCH better than on mobile. You can't even buy anything with MTXs unless I am mistaken and some clear care has gone into beefing up the visuals over the mobile version.It can seem a bit grindy from time to time, but generally it's easy enough to get cards and missions tend to be failed because of an error on my part (Even a few turns ago) rather than because I didn't have strong enough cards."

Yes it has much common like missions, storyline and cards mechanic. But also got new cool graphics and visual effects, new balance without crappy f2p component and new gui. This makes sense and overall feelings have nothing to compare with mobile game.Very hardcore CCG+TBS. You have to think at each of your step. 1 mistake and your character suffers lot of damage. Plan your tactics and count efforts - this is the key to victory. The combination of efforts and turns looks like a complication at first glance, but if you understand game mechanic, you'll love it. To simplify, the cheaper the card the sooner your character will get new turn. Use this knowledge.I've managed to pass first two missions and this game looks very similar with new x-coms so far. But not to worry to lose all your spacewolves - you can restart the mission so many time as you need to beat it.This game definately fullfils every cent and propably one of the best not AAA games in WarHammer 40k universe past last few years.I strongly recommend this game to every tbs players.For the Emeprror!P.S. Rage headshots with x-ray are awesome.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPD. 23.04.17I've got played new version with new weapon balance. It chaged everything. Now each weapon is useful and can find place in your deck. Range weapons are no ultimate decision anymore. You have to fill your deck with melee cards, which can now hit multiple targets or, ATLAST, strike diagonally. Also almost every weapon got new handy chain effects. Shotguns now can hit close range targets. Most of equiped weapon are now more efficient (cheaper or have better params) - that realy makes sense. I'm just learning to play with new balance, but as far as I've seen, it feels great.Looking forward next update.================================================================Игра обалденная!Прежде всего, должен сказать, что это - порт мобильной игры. Но не тупо перенос, а полноценное переосмысление. Да, тут много общего: миссии, сюжет, карточная механика. Но здесь просто чумовая графика для такаой маленькой игры, новый баланс и никаких проклятых микротранзакций, ура! Это действительно круто, и благоадря этому стим-версия очень сильно отличается от мобилки в лучшую сторону.SpaceWolf - это очень смесь коллекционной карточной игры с пошаговой стратегией, запралвенная таким хардкором, что х-ком забился в угол и нервно смолит самокруткой. По ощущениям очень похоже на режим ""железный человек"" из х-ком же. одна ошибка и неправильно выставленный персонаж получает тонну урона от противника. Комбинация системы усилий и пошаговости выглядит сперва очень сложно, но как только разберёшься в механике, то влюбляешься в неё. Предстаьте, как если бы ваш разведчик в х-ком делал не 1 действие, а несколько? И здесь это не только возможно, но и является обязательным для победы. Если упростить, то чем дешевле по усилиям стоит карточка, то тем раньше персонаж получит новый ход. Пример. у ближайших к нам противников по 10 усилий. Бьём их из огнемёта один раз и завершаем ход. Снова получаем ход, но у противников уже по 2 усилия. Расстреливаем их из болтеров - и вся наука.И да, здесь действительно много и часто делают больно. Но мы не рискуем своими любимыми персонажами, которые умирают навсегда из-за одного промаха (ага, опять х-ком) - максимум, придётся перезапустить миссию, чтобы взять этот чёртов сундук и параллельно убить 15 врагов.Игра определённо отрабатывает каждый вложенный рубль. А это только ЕА. Но уже сейчас игра выглядит и играется круче, чем большинство не AAA-игр по вселенной WarHammer 40000 за последние годы.Я совершенно точно могу рекомендовать игру всем любителям тбс.За Императора!П.С. А, ещё тут крутые х-реи с хедшотами.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ОБНОВЛЕНО 23.04.17Я добпался до игры с новым балансом оружия.Ну что сказать, ""война поменялась"". Самое заметное нововведение - рукопашное оружие может атаковать несколько целей за раз, например, молотки или когти, а ещё им теперь можно атаковать цели по диагонали. Дистанционное оружие теперь зачастую не может бить по целям в упор (я считаю, что это правильно, ближе к Бэку - никто не стреляет из болтера влоб), поэтому нужно собирать колоду с учётом ситуаций, когда враг подбежал вплотную к нам. Ещё у большинства карт появились классные цепные эффкты. Дробовик теперь с большей точностью лупит по целям вблизи; огнемёты наносят больше урона по раненым целям; тяжёлые болтеры частично пробивают броню. И таких нововведений просто тьма.Кстати, экипируемые карты, наконец-то, стали вменяемыми. Они или дешевле в использовании, или обладают интересными свойствами, или эффективнее по показателям. И это круто. Играть от этого, кстати, стало немного проще.Да, потребуется время, чтобы привыкнуть к новым правилам, но пока мне всё нравится.Жду новый апдейт. Обещали режим выживания, посмотрим, что там будет выпадать."
76561198025130838,Recommended,553210,30003874,Posted: 18 February,all,severedsolo,"I bought this on a whim yesterday, as I had a few pounds left in my steam wallet, so figured ""hey why not"". I've only played the first 3 missions, so bear that in mind while you read this review.If you've ever played 40k, think ""Kill team"". You get dropped in a zone with one soldier, your charachter (by the way, don't let him die - if you do it's game over). After beating a few Word Bearers you get a couple of reinforcements, and can move on to completing your mission.The first mission is unnecessarily difficult and long. You have to think very tactically to beat it, and there is an element of luck, it took me 4-5 tries. Mostly it involves figuring out how to bait the AI into splitting their fire, if they gang up on one of your troops, he's probably done for.One tip I'd give is: don't be too quick to press forward. Try and clear the area of enemies first, because more will appear, and you can quickly find yourself overwhelmed. This isn't always possible though, so again, tactics.May be a little slow paced for PC players, but I'm having a blast with it, and would recommend you give it a go. It's well worth the £8 I paid for it."

In order to go for the objectives you have to farm the low missions/ challenge mode to craft enough movement cards, to have a tiny chance to get away form these melee monsters of kultists. One upsetting feature is that you have to waste one movement card or else in order to turn on the spot, if an enemy moved behind you. With endless waves of chaos raptors there is no tactical movement possible.Sadly another 40k game with good intentions but bad implementation."

,Recommended,553210,30013170,Posted: 18 February,all,Jackrabbit_V6,"First of all let me say, as of today i´m glad to have payed 10 bucks for this, just because the devs are that awesome. I found a game breaking issue where i produced a situation in which the game was not playable anymore (flaw in the crafting system), and it took LESS than 2 minutes from posting my issue over response from the devs to solving the issue for me.Read todays patchnotes and you see, they seemlingly also put it into the fixes at the same day... That alone is worth 10 bucks in my eyes.Now the game... I give it a yes, because it is a cool game... But be warned: if you are - just like me - a complete noob to this game, it is GODDAM hard... you NEED to be a guy who is willing to try a mission several times, has a natural resistance to frustration and doesn´t mind it if some situations go bad just by bad luck.It is a card driven ""table top"" style strategy game and thus there is a huge random factor coming with the system. i´m personally hoping that there will happen alot of balance in that regard, or at least some kind of difficulty options over time. Nontheless, if you are in luck and get the right cards from your deck to your hand right away, it is great fun to smash the heretic´s skulls. This issue might also get better with owning more and more cards and being able to have less ""useless"" cards in the deck later, i will see and probably edit this review at some point.It has the potential to belong to the better WH40k games out there, and i would say it already does.Hardcore tactical guys will certainly ask me what i´m talking about with view on the difficulty, average to casual players will probably know what i mean... brain-lazy people should stay away from it though :)All in all, i can see the devs love their game and it is done in a way that shows it. I recommend it, as well as an appointment at your anti-stress-therapist :)"

But it's in love with overwhelming spawns and it hates you if you try to play conservatively. The way the game vomits out waves of enemies means that careful ""sweep and clear"" tactics don't work. You are ALWAYS overwhelmed. I just played a mission where the object is to get to a temple doorway. Getting near that door spawns 3 enemies. 2 truns later, another three enemies spawn. All of them use an ability that boosts each others defense attribute. And then, when you move up to start engaging them, a pair of enemies spawn beside you.And they get to move first.It's ridiculous. I'm all for games being challenging, but being battered over the head for playing carefully, to the point where the odds against you are ludicrous and your hopes of survival are about as high as a heretic at a Grey Knights Reunion, stops the game from being much fun. It becomes frustrating to the point of being unplayable. The only way to complete each mission, it seems, is to play it over and over and over again until you've learned all the spawn points and specifically play to deal with each one as it arrives. So tactics are out the window and you're playing to beat the meta system rather than anything else.Maybe they'll ease off on the spawns and let the player's tactics mean something, but until they do I really can't recommend this."

This game feels very much like the mobile port that it is. And, for a mobile game, it would be very good. But for a PC title it leaves very little by way of meaningful content. Of course, coming from a mobile development team, I suppose we could expect nothing less or more.5/10 - Painfully average."

Melee and ranged combat integrate fairly seamlessly, everything feels weighty and powerful, and there's less twitch-headshotting so much as twitch-combat. When you engage in fights, your suvival under fire lasts longer than many other strategy games, but indecision will still wipe you out."

The only thing I would like to see in a future update is for the health bar numbers for enemies to be easier to see.  It's hard to see what enemy health is on bigger screens (I connect my computer to my TV) because the red health bar tends to blur the health number.  If y'all could put an option to make enemy health bars different colors, or bold the health bar number for enemies, that would solve this issue easily.   Beyond that, I love the game, and have it on my tablet also!   Glory to Russ! Glory to the Emperor!"

Since every creature in the game goes through action points and displays, sometimes you can be waiting up to a min before a playable character can use actions/ out of all the missions where its a cross the finish line scenerio i have to cheat and use a summon spell to have him sprint to the finish line cause there is no way any of my guys can get through.-glitches/ the devs do patch frequently but some crashing amd weird loading screens will apear in the middle of battle- no outline of what to do with character building or forging of cards in between battles-enemies cheat to win, and way too many spawn in certain levels to make it fun. No learning curve either. after 1st level its gets really hard since you have no equipent to handle tougher enemies,,,expect to restart a mission a few times-no diffculty setting, would be more fun if had settings to allow people to take it at a slower pace. as it stands i can only play a songle mission at a time because it takes for ever and since the enemies cheat, i get frustrated and dont want to play another mission lolIn conclussion, wait for the game to be out of early acess when the devfs have time to address the bugs, difficulty settings and too many enemy spawns"
,Not Recommended,553210,31705496,Posted: 12 May,all,..,"Note on playtime: I played thru most of the campaign on the mobile  version, all points below apply to the PC versionTLDR: All in all I don't think it's a bad mobile game, but it comes out as a mediocre PC game with the 40k theme being more of an afterthought than a central design choice.Pros:+The card mechanic is simple and interesting. Customising your playstyle by building your own deck is pretty fun+ Unapologetically hard; If you don't like a challenge then this would be a con, however the game does make you think carefully about positioning which cards to use and when. Unfortunately most of the difficulty in single player comes from waves of enemies suddenly spawning (see below)+No micro transactions, unlike the mobile versionCons:-Ugly; Graphics look decidedly average on Mobile, on PC they look generic and awful, especially if you compare the character models the modern day models GW currently make (or even the ones 10 years ago for that matter)-Shallow; Tactics take a backseat to RNG and deckbuilding; No cover system, Ludicrously short weapon ranges (5 squares for a sniper rifle?) and the option to overwatch is (of course) based purely on the cards you draw-Bad level design; The campaign missions get very repetitive very quickly. Tiny weapon ranges and lack of a cover system means much of the map is unused.  For the majority of missions Enemies are not persistent from the beginning (like in x-com) but will spawn as you move through the map,  meaning trying to use part of the terrain/layout to your advantage, will probably just cause a bunch of chaos marines to spawn next to you, forcing you to stop, deal with the enemies on screen, and then move on to trigger the next wave (streets of rage style).  This was considered acceptable level design back in the 90's, not so much now.-Clunky Uninformative UI - Typical of most mobile ports-Bland story; the 40k universe is pretty rich in lore; but the story is pretty uninspiring and the character dialogue is very badly written-Not lore friendly: The Card mechanic, while fun, makes no sense.  Since the cards (mostly) represent weapons, your main character is walking into his first mission with 2 different types  of bolter, A flamer, a plasma pistol, a bolt pistol, a Plama Gun, a storm bolter, a Combi-Melta-Bolter, 3 types of chainsword, and a heavy boltgun, freely switching between them like a grimdark Duke Nukem."

Perhaps in a few months it'll improve, but I don't like it and question a lot of the design decisions.First issue - your ""arsenal of weapons"" are a bunch of cards that each character has.  Each character can have different cards.  This means they're somehow carrying piles weapons and other items, not what they would actually be able to carry.  They can be used to attack, or for some reason, move.  Yes, you can play a ""bolter +8 of shooting"", or whatever, and move a few spaces.  Make sense?  Nope.  Yes, there are also movement cards but you can't also use those to attack... seems like they should have just given you two actions to move and/or shoot. . . like most current turn-based strategy tactical combat type games.You can't use cover at all.  Nope, not at all.Movement is a mess, it's clunky.  Turning enough to shoot in much more than a 90 degree cone means playing a movement card.  Yep, that means that if you're directly beside someone but looking the wrong way then you need to spend one of your two actions to TURN toward them.  Yep, even if you could reach out and place your hand on their shoulder from where you stand, or aim your gin at them by only moving your head and your arm, you still must spend a full action to ""turn"" before attacking.Area effect weapons that an animation show hitting someone in an area, like a flame thrower, can still ""miss"" even though the enemy is in the area of effect and is clearly shown being hosed with flames.This game is a card-based, deck building mess.  It would have been better served with proper gear, reasonable tactical options during combat and real combat system that doesn't rely on ""item cards.""For me the combat is just plain bad.  It's just not fun to play.  Maybe it will be someday, but for now I recommend you avoid this one unless you're the ultimate Warhammer 40k fan who just has to have every 40k game out there."

It is a game that needs some work but has nice potential. You use a Card-based system to control the main characters’ combat actions and movements. You use cards to equipment, powers and skill your units to give you either move or neat attack skills.  Cards vary in rarity and maximum level (how many times players can upgrade the card). Cards can be leveled by combining two cards of the same type. Which I did not know. Players can create their own decks, picking the cards that fit their gameplay style and needs. There is a nice campaign mode to start, you can craft more cards. I have to say some good pros and consPROSA: Graphics and Effects are pretty solid and nice character movement. Hero craft deserves some kudos for effort.B: Like most TCGs, Hearthstone, Duelist, Warbands Bushido, another game  that mixes several games in one, card game, turn based tactical, and strategy, isometric and classic Warhammer 40k characters in one. If you like RTS or used to the fast paced 40k mmos, this is not for you.C: What pulls you in here is not the storyline but the battle system. Trying to figure combinations, placement, and despite a tabletop warhammer classic, Does not count on dice AI or those mechanics to play. This has a great modern polished look to the classic early turn based Warhammer 40k games.D: Game mechanics maybe be too simple for some, but a fun game to try of all ages. My kids enjoyed playing it.E: Great potential to go outside its grounded game mechanic template.CONSA: This is Early Access with a release date Q4 2017. Many may just wait for the full version, but I caught it at a huge sale so not a bad game to add until it is released for 5-10 bucks. Always caution on Early Access why its a con. Things can change on a dime with developers.B: A learning curve here with no real help so careful in crafting and using things before you know what your doing. Takes a while to learn combinations and the game mechanics which may make a novice player waste what he does not wish to.C: This game gets very hard very quick. AI will target your weakest and good players will crush novice ones in pvp. Caution. Campaign may drive you a little bats and for young players too much.D: I thnk there are some game mechanic issues I think can be improved on and I am sure they will before launch.E; What hurts is the lack of 360 camera movement, lack of character customizations, even creating your own card crafting using their template. For example, creating your own cards not crafting them, more rpg between your characters that your choices influence, multiple player pvp battles like 3v2 or 2v2, extending the party to be more than the min so you can have large scale matches, mounts. Hopefully they expand to keep the player invested, even the most experience gamers who have short attention spans.OVERALL: I give this a positive review. It is Warhammer and If you enjoy Game workshops line and history. You will enjoy the game. I am not sure were they wind up after completion, so my review is pending.I would do three things first, go to discussion, video and see a preview of the game. Get it on sale if you want to try the early access (another huge sale in June) and check the system requirements.Space Wolf has to build on the game mechanics that trap many other games that don't go beyond it. The f2p may hurt the experience in that as they add more content you may feel you don't wish to invest more in the game. A nice effort, but Space Wolf may not be able to hold gamers attentions long if it does not expand in other game mechanics and content. The game seems limited in its foundation.However, overall 3.2 stars out of 5. Not a bad addition to try."

This actually leads to more of luck instead of actual strategy excluding miss chances during attack.I am currently into the 4th mission with my leader and squadmates running at 800++ HP. Almost at the end of the mission, the AI brought in 6 enemies (with 300++ HP each) which have abilities to increase armour (AOE) and life regen (AOE) which none of my team has.Above that 6, there was another 2 enemies with jump packs (with 300HP each). This is crazy.How do you expect 3 guys with so basic stuff to win this fight even with 800++ HP not to mention the randomness of the cards.Also I believe the devs put in the randomness to increase game play time. As in there is no time limit for each mission. So after each wave, you can just sit there discarding cards until you have those that you need. Like I mentioned above, the cards are random so be prepared to be discarding cards for 15 minutes or more. (I have tried that and min time you need for your team of 3 to have all the cards you need for the next wave for each person is 15 mins that if if you are lucky).So come on Devs, it is fair that you would like to increase game play time but seriously, there are one thousand and one ways to do so instead of this method.Too bad I played more than 2 hours which means i can't get a refund.I would not recommend this game at all until the devs really look into making the game challenging with fun instead of boring and no fun.One more thing, not sure if the devs have actually played DoW II but they could make use some of the abilities and equipment from there afterall both games are from Warhammer 40K world so logically it should have some same abilities and equipment."

I wish for more X-com Enemy unknown(enemey within) or X-com 2 and less of the card game aspect. If they plan to milk money for microtransactions this will not be more than a sad flop.They should abandon the whole idea and make something trully great like the X-com reboot, a Warhammer 40k game with that setup would be amazing. Also there is a similar 40k ""card"" dependant game on IOS and Android, which is amazing compeared to this mess. The use of cards for every action in the shape of a deck is annoying to say the least, the fact you also must use a whole turn to simply turn around is silly to say the least. Melee weapons can only hit straightly infront of the character and not on the sides which also makes melee weapon powerful but very limited. The Effort system is however quite good, i liked it. The whole thing about various actions have an effort value affects the reaction time of your character. Meaning using something immensly powerful might also make your character not act quickly, while fast/weak moves can make good use of acting multiple times. If they removed the whole deck system and replaced it with a skill based and equipment based system only with effort it would be much better. Getting a skill unlocked from forging or booster packs, followed by equipping said skill to your main commander and perhaps even your squad members would be far better than the mess this game is now, and i honestly do not see the game getting better unless a major overhaul of how it works. It seems the plan is to make a microtransaction game similar to magic the gathering, heartstone and so on, but like i said. it isnt fun enough to work with their setup. The combat is slow and clunky as heck. The only good thing about the game in general is the difficulty it holds in the tactical aspect using effort, abilities and planning actually works, but this game is not worth spending money on at all."

For example, the missile launcher shoots 4 squares? Really? And the sniper rifle has a range of five? You're kidding, right? Nope. So, that's the first thing that started getting on nerves. Plus, firing at such short range, how is it I'm missing almost half my shots? The technology in the 41st Millenium really seems to have gone downhill with aim like that.Plus, having enemies spawn right on top of you is just stupid. I'm ok with enemies spawning in during a battle, but don't put them right on top of me after I've cleared an area. Jeez.Lastly, it seems the AI is beefed up (i.e., cheats) by having more accurate and damaging weapons than my own troops. I understand it's easier to do that than develop a good AI, but people have been doing AI in games for decades, this kind of trick is just disappointing.I've only played the campaign and challenges so far, so maybe multiplayer is a lot more fun (wouldn't be hard!). However, don't know if I'm willing to put in further time to find out, I'm sure that brings its own set of problems."

After my 3rd attempt to beat the first mission (average of 3-4 freezes and crashes per attempt), I've decided to let this one simmer in early access for a while before trying again.The fact is, there is what seems to be a fun and well implimented card driven tactics game beneith the veneer of♥♥♥♥♥♥that's covering it up, which is the only reason why I am not simply refunding this. However it is worthy of note, there is Early Access and there is barely playable pre-alpha garbage, and right now this is the latter. DO NOT BUY unless you are willing to take a risk that the game will be good at some point, because it isn't now. Which is a shame.I will update this review as development continues, as there is a lot of promise here, but there was a lot of promise in eternal crusade as well."

If you aren't already initiated into Warhammer games or you are willing to deal with a lot of learning curve frustration, don't buy this until it's further along in development. IMO early access releases should not skimp this much on tutorials or even tooltips.I requested a refund because it is too unfinished for the uninitiated like myself.That said, the game looks like it could be fun. I might pick it up once it's further along. I simply feel it was pushed out too soon."

Am also quite excited about the matches that I'll be able to experience with multiplayer. It's a rather simple tactical game for the PC space, and you definately get that mobile feeling while playing it. However, I don't feel it detracts from the overall experience as long as you enjoy card collecting and tactical style games."

Took me 7 goes to get passed the 2nd level (yes the 2nd level ... no easing into the game like most) and even then I only got through by sacrificing the other 2 marines, just so it wouldn't trigger level fail. Maybe if they get the balance right in this game, fix the camera and the weapons, it might be okay."

I wish I could say that I thought there might be some potential for this game to be good one day. I can't say either of those things honestly. This will never be a good game. Don't buy it to support future updates, don't keep it in mind for down-the-road, just leave this store page, and never look back.I'm a huge fan of 40K, particularly the Space Wolves. In my opinion, a Space Wolves video game has been a long time coming, and I was overjoyed when I saw that one had finally been released, albiet in Early Access. That excitement lasted about twenty minutes.This is one of the worst turn-based ""strategy"" games I've ever played. I put ""strategy"" in quotes, because this game spits in the face of strategy at every turn. For starters, the battle system is card based. What this means is that in addition to limited movement and action points, your options are restricted by what cards you have in your hand. You can discard cards from your hand and draw new ones, but this costs you your turn, so why even bother? Certain enemy attacks will also force you to discard cards at random, so you're even less likely to have anything useful in your hand when your turn starts. Three times now, I've failed missions through no fault of my own, but because I kept drawing hands that contained nothing but movement cards, and the enemy, who seem to have access to whatever cards they want, tore me apart.Speaking of the enemy, enjoy having waves constantly spawning in every time you move, every time you kill an enemy unit, and every time the game arbitrarily decides to. There is no way to methodically proceed through a map, because new enemies are always spawning in all over the map, including behind you. Basically, the game just lets the enemy overwhelm and flank you, regardless of how cautiously and tactically you approach a mission. No matter what, there will always be more Word Bearers coming in fresh to take a bite out of your exhausted Wolves.If that wasn't enough, the game's movement system is square-based. Like the original Civilization. From 1991. The design of this game is literally over two decades out-of-date. If you don't understand why square-based movement is a problem, keep in mind that this game's aiming system is directionally based, meaning that after you move, you select one of the four cardinal directions for your units to face, and this determines where they can attack. Is there any enemy at a diagonal angle to you? Too bad, because there's no way to target them. You'll just have to wait until they move, and deal damage to you, naturally, before you can attack them. Just another way the game tries to pass off bad design as challenge.The ridiculous number of enemy units that spawn in also means a long wait between each of your turns. While there is an option to speed up enemy turns, turning that option on does nothing. At the time of this review, that option is just a button that changes color when you click it. I personally prefer it when it's yellow, but I could understand someone liking the black option.Overall, this game is one of the worst bearing the Warhammer 40,000 license, and that's saying a lot when you look at how many poorly-made cash-ins Games Workshop has allowed to be released. I would not only recommend staying far away from this game, but also from any game by developer Herocraft. This is the most high-profile game they've put out, and if this is their best foot forward, they have nothing to offer that's worth even a dollar of your money."

The way it is deployed in this game is silly.  Having the weapon available to fire based on the cards in your hand, and it is possible to have 5 different weapons in that hand, is in my opinion entirely silly.  With this spread accross each marine in your squad and each with a different deck, this is too much sillyness.  Unfortunately, I can't get past it.  Only hope for me to put any hours in this game is for them to unsilly the card play.  I don't see that happening.Buy this game if 40k silly card play is for you."
