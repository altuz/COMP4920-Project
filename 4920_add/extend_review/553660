,Recommended,553660,33685873,Posted: 20 July,all,Nalicor,Pretty fun so far. My only worry is that if it doesn't get off the ground it might be dead within a year.
,Recommended,553660,33709351,Posted: 21 July,all,HKM,"UPDATE 3:I kind of gave up on the game as there was no one to play with, but I kept in touch with the moderators and the devs, and now the price has been reduced from 30 USD to 13 USD, this will surely encourage more people to buy the game, and I don't have any regrets now for paying 23 dollars because I got alot of loot which I'm happy with ;P. Anyways you should give the game a shot now since 13 dollars is a very affordable price for a game which has the most flexible developers and staff who are open to any criticism. The swarm after the youtubers make the update video on PWND is something I'm looking up to.UPDATE 2:Thanks to everyone who upvoted my review, I'm making this update to let you know how much it was worth it to buy this game, the new challenges mode makes it so much better itself that I would have paid almost three quarters of the price of this game for the challenges part, so excited for other game modes to be released, until then I'd spend me time trying to beat these nerve wrecking records in challenges and PWN some suckas!UPDATE:This team is really pushing the game out, there are many more matches I can find now and even though I already gave it a positive review, I can now fully recommend it to anyone who is looking for an active community and not just a hard enjoyable journey, thanks everyone for voting up my review.PWND, it's a fast paced shooter and is definitely a competition for the gaming market, ofcourse since this is in early access, some gaps still have to be filled but about after 2 ""Quick"" matches, I decided to write this;My first few attempts followed with game crashes, and as soon as I joined in it teleported me to the same loading screen and crashed again, then I managed to get in the game with a FPS of 40-60 at all times on low settings (ik I got a potato) but for an early access game on my machine, that's quite good, I enjoyed the gameplay and this game has alot of potential, I hope the developers don't just ditch it and actually continue updating it, for now I'd recommend waiting for a while before buying this game if you really want a guranteed experience but who knows, you may miss out on a epic incoming journey, I've got alot of expectations out of this game, wishing the developers best of luck :)[NOTE ABOUT THE PRICE] In my eyes the price is just about fine, it costs fiarly little to what type of experience it can give you and hopefully is some sort of a promise that the developers are really serious about the game, once out of early access with it's full potential, this game can be a great game."
,Recommended,553660,33744823,Posted: 23 July,all,Da_Bomb,This game is so awesome and fun. Really hope the player base expands. I look forward to seeing what the devs do to improve the game.
,Recommended,553660,33759936,Posted: 23 July,all,Peace yo11,"This game is a great game for everyone who enjoys BMing their enemies. It's still early on so I'm not surprised that there's only 4 characters, and 3 maps, but it's been out for under a week. That's understandable. It's a very promising game that looks like it will be very good in the near future. I can't wait to see what it has in store for future updates. It really gets the adreniline pumping as you're hoping that you're able to get that fat pwn stack to win the game for your team. 10/10 would reccomend for all who are into FPS games."
,Recommended,553660,33735983,Posted: 22 July,all,Thirty2BitGamer,"WHOOOOOOOOOOOOO BABYThis is a fun one.Fast paced FPS Rocket Arena style game with a twist. There is a lot more strategy built in then you would think, and each game is nonstop mayhem. Games are intense, quick, and oh so satisfying.PROS: Amazingly built for a beta,Devs are extremely nice,Rediculously addictingFantastic competitive potential.CONS: Not much content with 4 maps and 4 characters (Still a beta, keep in mind)Not that big of a fanbase,Needs some touching up on bugs and such.CONCLUSION: Yes this game has its flaws, but so do a lot of popular ""hero shooters"", and this is still in beta (trust me, the devs are listening to the fanbase for any bugs or suggestions). This game is taking a step in the right direction with its unique and amazing fast paced style gameplay.9/10, a new favorite FPS of mine. Perfect for a group of friends to hang out and fight together, especially when the custom games setting will come out.NOTE: Many people are hating on this game for being ""unoriginal"" and ""very boring"", but trust me, once you play this one, you will not regret it. People said the same thing about a certain FPS made by Blizzard, and even about CS GO, and those are some of the most popular games out right now. The only thing this game needs is a good fanbase. This game has an amazing potential if it is supported by a good community. Don't leave this one in the dust like others.AND GET READY TO GET PWND, SUCKAS!!!!"

,Recommended,553660,33766409,Posted: 24 July,all,gst800,"Fastpaced projectile only arena shooter, its fun when played on low ping, sadly currently has low online so will spend most of the time playing on usa servers with big ping."
76561198084285034,Recommended,553660,33771646,Posted: 24 July,all,PENGUIN,"This game is loads of fun, but for the amount in the game is not enough to warrant the price tag.... Maybe after they have added some more to the game. I have read some of the reviews for this game saying it chrashes this is true, but I have had it crash on me twice in the 10 hours I have played and most of the time it's after I have alt tabbed. For people to say they can't reccomend this game because it took them a very long time to find a game what did you expect playing a game that was just released and they didn't do much in the way of advertising for the game. hopefully this game grows in popularity as time goes on.With all that said this game is still in beta and buying a game at full price in beta you should expect to have some missing content and bugs.All in all I would recommend this to anyone who likes fast paced FPS. There is always steam refunds if you end up not liking it."
,Recommended,553660,33707381,Posted: 21 July,all,Sofa | Designated Bottom Fragger,"After about 3 hours of game time, I've really had a great time with it. My only complaint so far is that I've had it crash when Alt-Tabbing in Windowed mode.Gameplay is great, fast-paced, and easy to learn. Only real complaint for it is that there is no offline/practice mode to practice the different characters.My final verdict is that this game is definitely worth picking up as long as it stays updated. Lots of potential in PWND, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what they do with it."

,Recommended,553660,33700437,Posted: 21 July,all,Dtagz,"I think this is a good game so far. They're doesnt seem to be a lot of content in it as of its release yesterday. The only thing you can play is quick play. The waiting times are reletively long. I hope that's just because the games new and it will be fixed overtime. I do believe that this is a good game but, the price of it seems a bit absurd since their isn't a lot of content in the game. I'd like for PWND to do well but just the main issue is the lack of content that this game is delivering the $32.99 cad price tag. I do reccomend this game but, just be aware of the content issues. I'd suggest waiting until the price tag is around between 10-25 before purchasing it. Also the game only is 1.9 gb so it currently doesn't take up much space. Best of luck to the creators. Hope the game becomes a success."
,Recommended,553660,34625903,Posted: 30 August,all,Soul-Vertigo,This is simply one of the most fun Arena shooters I have ever played. The characters and game style are truly unique and I it is both ridiculous and challenging with a well coordinated team. The servers have been starting to fill up a lot more with recent events and the price cut which is awesome because this game is a blast with friends.Now that they have done a recent price cut I cannot recommend this game enough! There is a new character dropping in September and more right around the corner and the game is still only in early access! If you get the game be sure to join the discord. Really great community and Devs have created a real gem. Can't wait to see what to come!
,Not Recommended,553660,34063401,Posted: 6 August,all,spk.infrared_,"So, I bought it.I don't write reviews nor do i have an interest in doing reviews. I don't truly find them to have value because alot of what makes a game great for someone is subjective. This game was up my ally, i love fast paced shooters. I love Quake, Unreal Tournament style games and have my entire life. I saw this new arena style shooter with a twist and figured it would be enjoyable. I was wrong, but let me explain why.Pwnd has the makings to be a large title, the art style is attractive and well done, Voice work is funny and entertaining and the concept is silly but rewarding.This all end up not mattering when you join an online game and no one is playing it but they queue you with bots and everything becomes very delayed. the latency issue of this game makes it almost unplayable, rockets do not go where they should because you feel like playing a HPB (high ping ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) from old school 56k days and end up having to lead a insane amount inorder to hit someone.Jumping and just moving are also delayed, i understand this is an early access game..... but it's early access at $30! No thats not alot of money and frankly if this were a full release it would be a steal, it's upsetting they spent so much of their efforts with Vanos, Nogla, Ohm  and h20 just for them to actually not give viewers a true expectation of the game just showing game footage.to wrap this up.Graphics 9/10Music  9/10comedy 10/10gameplay 6/10netcode 1/10The best thing this game offers is a challenge mode where you can learn the movement style and still have quite a bit of fun in trying to get S rank and 3 coins. multiplayer has to many issues and not enouigh people playing."

,Recommended,553660,35429186,Posted: 2 October,all,DrDreadMarley,"Gonna give a thumbs up in hope that these developers get a chance, can see they worked hard on this game and the art style is very good, cant see myself playing but when they figure out how to create traction to pull people into this game the better it can get."
,Recommended,553660,35432662,Posted: 2 October,all,MY LITTLE PWNY,"This game is amazing. only thing is, i with the community was more active. it would probably help if it was F2P"
,Not Recommended,553660,35399268,Posted: 1 October,all,d2k.dropp,"Amazing game, really fun to play.But in my opinion, this game should be F2P.The matchmaking is the worst, can't find players, and after a match ends it disconnects and you have to start another search, wich takes a very long time, even when it says ""short"" waiting.This game is great, but will die very soon, although i don't see it very much alive, since it has almost no players at all.FIX THE MATCHMAKING OR GO F2P. I want to play the game, but i can't find any match.I have 2 hours on this game: 1 hour searching, 1 hour actually playing the damn game!"

The Devs seem willing to actually listen to the community and make changes based on popular decisions/demands. It has a fast paced, action packed shooter quality with tons of laughs and intense gameplay. As of right now the game is a little on the empty side, but I have high hopes that this game will pick up a bigger playerbase sometime soon in the future."

It's fun even to watch just to try and keep your eye on the action and carnage. The only downside I can see right now is the slow queues and match making. Other than that, its on par with other shooters I play"

76561198002574214,Not Recommended,553660,33684781,Posted: 20 July,all,SmOkEy,So after playing one round of this game i requested a refund. Game play was fun until i realised the entire games points are revolved around jumping on some ones dead body. This mechanic to me breaks the game entirely since you can get across the map in 1-2s. Not enough characters in the game and not very well thought out abilities to balance the game. Great art style and the movement was nice.
