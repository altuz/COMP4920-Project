,Not Recommended,553880,34033211,Posted: 5 August,all,Rafport,"Archangel is a marvellous idea over a weak gameplay. Your mech is just outstanding, great design and details, massive scale proportion. In the intro/tutorial you feel so powerful and the indirect hand control of your giant robot works as it should.Sadly, this is the peak of the game. Many complained about being on rails: great arcade games are usually on rails, I'm perfectly fine with this as soon as the gameplay is fun and compelling.In Archangel you have to do four actions:1) shot with crosshair (60% of your time)2) to use your shield to block enemy shots (38% of your time)3) to punch something (1% of your time)4) to grab something (1% of your time)It if wasn't for the story and the huge mech, Archangel would be an extremely boring seated shooter. And the story is not that good.Is it a disaster? No, I don't think so. It very depends on how much you loves robots, I like them a lot but love also good games. Here you get just the robot, at this price doesn't worth for me."

Think 'Gunjack on earth' with a story.If you like your games dark, twisted and smart with an intriguing and original story, or you're looking for VR games that are more physically challenging, this might not be for you.Bottomline :  excellent mindless (seated) shooting entertainment on rails for dads and sons  :)"

,Recommended,553880,33988308,Posted: 3 August,all,wonderbreadvr,"YES. ABSOLUTELY YES. THANK YOU SKYDANCE.The moment my mech arms powered up, I knew I was in for an epic ride. The sense of scale and immersion are second to none. I've played quite a few Vive games, and this one is among the top five. AAA quality, top notch graphics, epic gameplay, crunchy sound design (wish the mech sounds were slightly louder), ""Inception bwah"" music, decent acting, plus everything else. Nevermind that it's on rails. You're too busy trying to kill everything in sight to worry about moving. Focusing on the separate functions of both arms requires enough of your concentration. I know other reviewers are saying this game is only 2.5-3 hours long, but I'm cool with that. I'd gladly play a game that is a rock solid 3 hour experience, then an 80 hour grindfest.For the price - Imagine it like you are going to watch a 3D movie, and you buy your popcorn and drink... it's probably about 30 bucks. But instead, it's a fully interative 3D movie with badass mech combat, and you can replay it whenever you want! Besides, you probably paid around two thousand bucks for your Vive/computer rig. 30 bucks for this experience is a drop in the bucket compared to that. In fact, this is exactly the kind of thing you bought your Vive for!I was honestly starting to get a little weary of waiting for the next VR experience. This is it. This is the beginning of second generation VR content right here. Get it while it's hot!10/10 - Freakin' amazing!! Thank you Skydance!! I will showcase this game to EVERYONE."

Like many said, you cant physically control the mech, this wasn't huge for me but it would have been nice. My biggest problem is the time it took to complete. It's a 2 hour game, and for $30.00 it's not worth it. It looks visually well, but there is not nearly enough game play for it being on rails."
,Not Recommended,553880,34399399,Posted: 21 August,all,Star Trucker,The in-game controls are rotated 90° towards the player's chin from the vive controllers. This bug makes the game unplayable. Seems really cool other than the fact I can't control the mech.
,Recommended,553880,34724780,Posted: 3 September,all,udel007,"TDLR: Worth the buy especially if you have more than one person who would like to play through. Acceptable graphics, good interface, decent immersion, though its an ""on rails"" game meaning you DO NOT PILOT the Mech. Under par voice acting, writing. But -- you are blowing stuff up while in a huge Mech - life ain't so bad!Descrpition:- Man the weapons of a 6 floor high Mech in VR. Battle your way through waves of enemies with your AI allies (think allies like in StarFox). Expect about 4 hours of gameplay and there are a few times you will feel satsified by the destruction. Best comparision for this game is T2 arcade version but in a mech and in VR. I generally prefer more complicated simulator type titles, but this was worth the playthrough.Its only natural to have a mech game in VR. This is really the first one. And its not bad. If you shelled out at least $500 on a VR system, $29.99 is a reasonable price point. Given that VR software is still in its infancy - this title does a pretty good job.Pros:- You are in a 6 story Mech!- Immerision - Thats what VR is all about. From the intro, they do a pretty good job at making you feel as if you are inside the game. The introduction was well done up until the story starts but its not good enough to where you care about any of the characters.- Interface - you don't control the mech, only the guns, but its a simple interface that divides your attention enough to make it challenging a times (I played though on hard and died a handful of times).- Simple, fun arcade style destruction.Con:- Story: Short, predictable. does not make you care about any characters, BUT it gets the job done enough to keep you playing through the entire game.- Graphics: They aren't that great, but they do the job and don't burn up your GPU.  Keep in mind that the headsets are not very high resolution at this point so devs have to pick an artistic style and go with it  Compare to an arcade game in a movie theature back in the day.- Voice acting: meh at best- Cannot skip cut scenes if you die and have to replay, but the game is not very hard even on hard so its not that big a deal.- Bugs: There are a couple of bugs that kick in where you cannot shoot incoming missiles and where you cannot use the game selection menu which is a problem when you die forcing you to restart steam and the game (you will lose progress but they levels or not that long nor difficult).During my plathough I ran into these bugs 4 times toatl. Annoying but was not a deal breaker and I'm sure they will get fixed."
76561198000790392,Recommended,553880,34282481,Posted: 16 August,all,AgentM83,"This is the futuristic game I imagined and longed for while playing things like Virtual On in arcades in my youth. While I'm still looking for a fully locomotive mech action game, I'd initially, unfairly dismissed Archangel on discovery of its being 'on rails', where your path in the game is both predetermined and automated. Once I gave it a chance, though, I was immediately struck by a few things I didn't expect to experience:1)The story. That opening sequence has an impressive amount of immersive world building and expressive npcs. In such a short period of time I was emotionally invested in the character you play as, not just because of his personal loss, but because I expected his response would be more heroic/morally driven. That voice acting is quaking with rage, with a thirst for revenge that took me as much by surprise as it appears it did his squad mates.2) A diagetic reason for the 'comfort cage'. This isn't the first game to use a cockpit for those purposes, but it makes a lot of sense here and is well implemented. Others that I've seen still felt like I was just wearing a cage on my face rather than inside of a space.3) Graphic fidelity. This game looks great in VR.If you're in the mood for a high octane arcade experience with immersive atmosphere and some action-movie-level drama, give this a shot."

76561198199779867,Recommended,553880,34196673,Posted: 12 August,all,Al And Paris,"Briefly: great game in VR, you really feel like you're in the cockpit. However, the action going on outside does not seem to be full 3D - I suspect it is the same view sent to both eyes. If you've experienced the rabbit-themed ""Invasion"" demo video, you'll know what I mean. This doesn't take away from the gameplay very much though, it's a lot of fun and a great shooter. Also, the 'on rails' element is not a negative at all - as another reviewer said, you won't have time to bother with that, you'll be too busy trying to shoot everything. Good game, not sorry I bought it."

Yes its on rails and yes ultimatelly its just a shooter, but the immersion and satisfaction of feeling like you are controlling a mech is incredible.  For those that are saying its to expensive, well I feel sorry for you as I am not quite sure what you expect from game makers these days, maybe you should drop your expectations or better still, try creating a game yourself and see what its like have everybody criticise your hard work. Seeing as im in  my late 30's and was around when gaming began and a huge mech fan to boot, this game has fulfilled my fantasies,  not since Steel Battalion on the Xbox have I felt more in control of a mech.Production value is epic in scale and you really feel for the main character and share his anger rage.Graphically its very good and clearly more than a tech demoFor me the replay value is highSo much is going on when under attack that you loose focus on all the little discrepenciesI play with the Rift and Touch and I can see this type of game progressing in many ways if the right production budget was given to the development team.  in future updates or a potential sequel i would like to see the following:Show the rest of Gabe/Gabby's body sat in the chairProvide more functionality of the cockpitProvide actual control of the mech via the sticks and give the freedom neededImproved detail of the battlefield, buildings, weather effects, enemiesAbility to pick up objects to use offensively and defensivelyMore noise from the legs/louder stomping when walking to improve the sensationparticle effects from walking when looking down ie; clouds of dust, waves and ripples in water, large splashes, cars/containers exploding when walked overDefensive abilities; flares, chaffs, EMP pulse, communications jammer,use of buildings to provide coverUp close 1 to 1 battle with enemie mechs!SWORD!!! every mech has to have a sword!!!ELBOW ROCKET!!!  ok i can only dream about that one lol!!Personally I would like to thank Skydance Studios for fulfilling one of my fantasies.  As I said above the potential to what this game can lead on to is extrememly exciting and exactly what the VR world needs.Just get it!!!"

Don't get me wrong Its a fun game to play.When you stand below the mech and look upward,  you will be overwhelmed by its size.The loading sequence is realistic and believable...I am fully immersed...the only thing I felt negative about this game is there is absolutely no freedom...you are an actor in a movie on rails from beginning to end...like riding in a universal studios ride, you just look around and just pull the trigger.....There is a free game called the War Robots VR: The Skirmish ...heck you play with a keyboard and a mouse...but I gave it a high recommended rating because it felt real and more interactive with freedom of movement.

Graphics are great, minus the fact that the environments and city scapes feel a bit under whelming because they seem to be lacking detail.  the motion capture for the players son and voice acting is pretty great.  They do a good job of giving you  a narrative that you actually can get into and give you a reason to play.  I'm not the greatest at this kind of game so even on easy I have plenty of challenge.  At first I was bumbed because I couldn't really control anything but my arms, guns and sheilds,. but for me at least it gets intense enough that I am glad I don't have to worry about anything else.  The way they do the AI for the mech it makes sense that you aren't in control of manuvering.  I would like to have more Haptics,.. something,. like maybe to make you feel the rumble of the ground since you are walking around in a 6 story mech,. and maybe more with the guns and and being hit by enemy fire.  it feels a bit empty in that reguard.   I also feel like the 30 price tag is pretty steep for what this game is.   but I'm guessing that is due to the production values which are pretty great compaired to many VR games.  So I give this a 3 out of 5 stars and reccomend it for folks looking for some casual shooting in a game where you can sit if you like, even though I still prefer standing.  If you want a deep, involved mech sim then DO NOT buy this game because you will be pretty dissapointed,.. probably even♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off."
