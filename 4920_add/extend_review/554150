,Recommended,554150,32830450,Posted: 26 June,all,tenshi_a,"Perhaps if I play this game long enough, I will stop wishing it was Time Pilot.I wish it were Time Pilot.It's a top-down shooter - endless planes to shoot, challenge set by a deliberately limited screen size. Missions to complete. Stars to earn, feeling of progression. Lots of power ups (some of which are not good). Lots of planes to unlock (some of which are not good).I feel like the developer didn't spend enough time playing the game to realise - unlocking a faster plane is not such a good thing when you have a limited screen and bullets that are too weak to shoot down an enemy quickly. And that some of the power-ups act as a hindrance.The ""move a mouse pointer with a joystick to navigate menus"" system is really not great. It breaks flow at the end of every game.I know it is not generally helpful to describe a work in terms of the things it is not, but I so dearly wish this game were Time Pilot. But retaining this game's mission and unlockables structure, which I like because it keeps the game fresh.All in all, it's a very reasonable game for its price. For that, I give it an overall thumbs-up. But it's not brilliant."

Overall about 3 hours of gameplay before you unlock everything. An excellent bargain for $.99. I got way more fun out of it than that!"

Complete all the tasks!In all seriousness, I voted for this on Greenlight and glad it made it to steam and worth the wait too!It's a cute bullet hell game that you can't help but keep playing and shooting. It's addicting to play, challenging too for personal goals, while not frustrating or overwhelming. Something to play on the side when waiting for someone or something.I do have to give a word of caution: beware of going full-screen. It crashed my game, and when I try to boot it up, it would crash instantly because it would go to full-screen. I don't know what's causing that problem, but best to avoid that. If you do find yourself in that situtation,here's a thread I made for a solution thanks to the dev.At times the plane may not be visible, this is more or less a graphic bug in the game. Simply hit the dodge button and it'll appear as normal.Feels like a crime getting this game for a $1 when it feels like a $2 or $3 game.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish."

It also has a progression system which allows you to unlock real 40s-50s planes. The planes play differently so there is good replay value. I wholeheartedly recommend this game!"

I found this game to be very, very fun. Here are some of the pros:Cheap.The game's levels increase in difficulty, but not to hard.Multiple planes.Multiple gamemodes.Great music.Great design.Very simplistic.Each plane is diffrent.Multiple guns.Multiple enemies.Unlockables.""Tasks""And probabaly some other stuff I don't remember.Overall, buy this game, it's amazing. I couldn't find anything bad about it."

This a big plus. So I thoroughly recommend this under priced game to anyone who wants a bit of nostalgia, some reasonably easy achievements and some great shoot em out of the sky fun. I recommend continuous mode, or is it never endingmode ? oh well  you'll know when you see it ! Great fun."
,Recommended,554150,29681059,Posted: 3 February,all,RandomGuyZero,"For the $1 price, this game has a nice amount of content. Different game modes, multiple planes to unlock, and leveling up to obtain new weapon bonuses are just a few of the things this game offers. Depending on the game mode you can have full freedom of movement or fly arena style where the edges are to be avoided. Whether for true casual play, score chasing, or passing the time I highly recommend this title. Earn your ""Frequent Flyer"" miles now :P"
,Recommended,554150,34572875,Posted: 29 August,all,HailHydra,"I think I got this game for $.49 on sale and even at a Buck, this is a lot of game for the money you're paying out. It reminds me kinda of old-school SHMUP games like Raptor on Windows 95 and the music was plenty entertaining. I really do recommend people buy this title, support the devs and just zone out for like 30 minute chunks of time whilst playing, it's a decent way to spend your time I'd say and is fun. Cheers!"
,Recommended,554150,29525884,Posted: 27 January,all,elnormous,"The game is a shoot-em-up game, but allows you a full 2D freedom of movement. The missions get more and more challenging, but they are really repetitive (kill X enemies, get X score or survive for X seconds). I liked the game. Totally worth the 1$."

,Recommended,554150,29378661,Posted: 20 January,all,MastaCody of 99 Cent Gaming,"I personally purchased this game. I reviewed it for my 99 Cent Gaming series.My expectations for low-budget SHMUPs took a nose dive (ha...plane humor) as I started review games for my series due to the tendency to put in the minimal amount of content. Thankfully, Coldwild Games avoids this with some pretty fun progression systems, multiple unlocks, and different modes.Coming into this game with low expectations allowed me to breath a sigh of relief just from the character select screen and mode select screen alone. Frequent Flyer has 10 different ships with their own stats that can be unlocked throughout the course of the game, and 4 different modes which include Mission, Infinite, Organized (waves of a single ship attack you, one type at a time), and Time Attack. All these modes feature the roster of 10 enemies who themselves have different stats, tons of pick ups ranging from ammo refills, health, upgrades and MISSILES! As I said, it avoids having a lack of content.Ships are locked behind a STAR collection wall which you earn from beating missions and picking them up during game play. There's also tasks you can complete that lets you earn them, which for me was the icing on the cake for Frequent Flyer. They stuff a lot of different activities for players to do that it's hard not to keep playing trying to unlock everything, earn all of the achievements, and start brushing up your skills for the leader board.There were a few issues I had however. First was the inclusion of tweeting out your score to earn more stars. I felt that this was not necessary for a game that already had a lot of ways to do so. It gave me a mobile free2play feeling that just didn't sit well with me. That said it's not forced upon the player and you can choose to ignore it. I get wanted to tweet out something both for bragging rights and to show support, but this way is just not for me.Secondly was using tank controls. Now this is less of a game issue and more of my personal preference, but having controller support left me wanting more of a dual-stick control scheme. I don't know if this can be added by the devs but I personally would love it.Outside of those two things, and some aesthetic overlaps, I didn't find anything wrong with what I played and was overjoyed to see a developer attempt to stack their game with some fun options at such a low price. I have more to say in my video below, but was Frequent Flyer worth the 99 cents I paid for it: ABSOLUTELY.   They even mentioned that even though the game is complete, they are open to feedback and suggestions. Give this game a go to support this type of game, and let the developer know what you'd like to see in this fun little SHMUP.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkiJ7LsFbrY"

,Recommended,554150,32894824,Posted: 27 June,all,Meow,"Reminds me of classics like 1942 or Raptor (Call of Shadows), or even the more modern Luftrausers.  Fun little game that you don't have to let it take a huge block of time to play and just come back to here and there over and over or you can play for a good stretch at one time.  I've been playing for about an hour so far and haven't noticed anything yet that, oh, I wish this was different, or I wish they did that better.  Solid, fun game.  :)  It took the Steam sale for me to notice this game, but if you're into this style of game, it's very easily worth the $1 full asking price, or even a couple bucks more."
