,Not Recommended,554310,26987363,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,PheonixGRX,"This game is just as bad as it looks. For those curious about it, imagine you are in a cloud level of Mario that scrolls the screen, but you have no way of falling off the edge. The enemies will spawn on either side of you, but the money (or potatoes) that they drop will still roll off, making it hard to collect them all. The story feels nonexistant and feels as though it was inspired by 2010 9gag comics based on how it was written. At no point should anyone consider buying this game, unless it is as a horrible gift for someone that you hate."
,Not Recommended,554310,30894224,Posted: 1 April,all,䷃䷋䷃䷏䷀ ䷴䷼䷝,"i have only played this game for about fifteen minutes, but a quarter of an hour is all it will take for you to have seen everything this game has to offer.As you might have guessed from the screenshots, this is pretty much a Flash game. It may not be coded in Flash, but it is very much of the low-quality that one might expect from any of the thousands of free-to-play, web-based, simple mouse + keyboard games found on sites like NewGrounds.Which brings us to the first problem with this game. It really should be controllable with a standard twin-stick controller, which it is not. Using the steam controller is relatively painless, once you have managed to get the damned thing set-up properly which brings us to issues number two and three.This game really does not like you reconfiguring the Steam Controller while it is running. I managed to set up a working configuration, but I had to reset my machine a couple of times in the process as changing the config. caused my Steam Machine to get stuck on the configuration editor screen.And the game is just really poorly coded in general, really amateurish in almost every aspect, even for a gag-game. How a game of this quality makes it to the Steam Store is a mystery. Except when one considers the marketing value of using a well known meme as your premise. So if this is some kind of cynical marketing excercise by valve then ""Boo Valve!""Which brings us to my more subjective criticisms of this game. Being meme-based is not necessarily a bad thing in itself, but this game gives me the distinct impression that the author spent about as much time working on this game as one might typically spend on producing one of the simple comic strip images which this game is based on. I would be surprised and a little disappointed if the author spent any longer than 15 minutes to half an hour working on this.That kind of production quality might be fine for what basically amounts to free content on a social media platform, and might be a laugh if played for free on the afore mentioned website NewGrounds. But this is Steam, and even for two US quarters this games is overpriced by at least 100% .Even if you have several gigabytes of rage meme images on your hard-disk I might still advise against purchasing this game, the only enjoyment I see myself getting out of this game is the small amount of joy I get from identifying bugs and then laying the boot into a poor game.2.5 out of 10"

,Recommended,554310,29815417,Posted: 9 February,all,dog hello,"I bought this game because I teach an online computer class and my students always had a lot of free time because they finish their work early. My students requested that I allow them to play games when they are finished with their work. A lot of them asked for games like Battlefield and Grand Theft Auto, but those games cost way too much. I needed a cheaper option. So I decided to look up what is popular on the internet nowadays. After deep research on a site known as ""Know Your Meme"", I discovered Rage Comics. These comics have been entertaining young adults for almost a decade. So, I looked to see if there were any games dedicated to these funny faces. Boy, I was sure in luck! I found this game. Funny, cheap, and trendy! I then bought a copy for all of my students and now they play it every single day. I even caught a few kids trying to play before they finished their work! Wow they are hooked! If you have a child who wants to play the latest games but don't want to sacrifice their college fund, this is the choice for you!"

,Recommended,554310,32797049,Posted: 25 June,all,Mena,"Please do stop using ""LEGO"" as the plural form for LEGO pieces. Instead of saying ""I need a tub to sort all of my LEGO"", instead use proper grammar and say ""I need a tub to sort all of my LEGO pieces"" (or bricks, toys, components, etc.) You are destroying the LEGO trademark by referring to the pieces themselves as ""LEGO"". If everyone does this, the term ""LEGO"" will become generic, and other inferior companies will legally be able to produce and sell ""LEGO"". LEGO themselves have made this point numerous times. I tracked down a bit of text off of a LEGO box from 1980: ""Dear Parents and Children The word LEGO® is a brand name and is very special to all of us in the LEGO Group Companies. We would sincerely like your help in keeping it special. Please always refer to our bricks as 'LEGO Bricks or Toys' and not 'LEGOS.' By doing so, you will be helping to protect and preserve a brand of which we are very proud and that stands for quality the world over. Thank you!"

,Recommended,554310,30935610,Posted: 3 April,all,Time Regime,"This is easily the highest quality product available on Steam, with amazing graphics, gameplay, story and soundtrack, highly surpasing the overrated trash known as Undertale. Don't believe me? Allow me to explain this gem known as ""Rage wars"".1. Graphics: Simply amazing, if you thought games like Overwatch, Witcher III, or GTAV were nice, you haven't seen ANYTHING yet. Rage Wars includes all of your favorite Rage Faces™, and creative enemy designs, all in stunning HD, with the most detailed backgrounds in gaming. Even the arena, with only one background, presents it in a minimalistic but subtle beauty that it's enough to stand out, but isn't distracting from the gameplay.2. Speaking of gameplay, there is only one was to describe it: Pure. Epic. At the start, you have Dual Pistols, and can either use weapon drops to temporarily gain a weapon during the level, or use the potatoes (an amazing form of currency) to unlock the weapon drops permanently. While they normally would be used for the epic Rage Face™ reskins, they actually give them to you for FREE! Also word of advice for achievement hunters, try to collect 5000 potatoes BEFORE buying weapons.3. The story is simply phenominal. Derp, in school, finds out his crush, Herpina, has been kidnapped by Dr. No, and must attack a zombie onslaught to save her. Along the way, you will be decieved, and learn to push yourself, a great message to teach the modern gaming community. And the ending, while I'd rather not spoil it, has funny twists that will keep you LMAO'ing™ for days!4. Oh man, the soundtrack. Simply GORGEOUS! What's that? You thought Undertale had a good soundtrack? You thought some other inferior game had a soundtrack that you thought could even SLIGHTLY compare to the OST of RAGE WARS?! Well, I think you'll learn that Rage Wars soundtrack, while short, has beautifully composed tracks, perfectly fitting the mood of each location they are used in. Each instrument is recorded using the highest quality recording software known to man.Well, there you have it, the PERFECT video game. As of this review, it's availble for a MERE $0.49! Quite valuable to partake now for this epitome of greatness, although it's almost worth it to buy it a $0.99 just to support the amazing people who worked on this masterpiece."

I can honestly say that it broke me. I wanted to get the video done and edited in one day but I had to take a few days off just to comprehend what I jumped into.It didn't exceed my expectations, It didn't crash my expectations, In fact it met my expectations, and they were pretty low.You could call this the worst game ever but really think about it. It's an indie game based off rage comics for a dollar... a dollar. The game is the equivalent of a programming class final project that probably got an A, but didn't really impress many in the class. It's bad... It's really bad... It's mind numbing......  Try it out.I'm serious it's one of those games that are so bad you just need to see to be true..."

Dude, the jerky enemy and player movements, it adds so much life to the game, letting everyone teleport instead of walking, that's awesome because they do it because they can, and that makes it cool.
