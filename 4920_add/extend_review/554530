Can be a bit of a headache to some people because of the level layouts, but overall I didn't have many problems. There's also a 2-player mode, so if someone wants to play a little quick game with his friend, Crackhead is a good solution."

With different music (or music that stays muted) and without the awful flashing lights I might find it playable. Used to love pong as a kid, and this is more or less just a slight spin on pong."
