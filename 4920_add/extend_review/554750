You are not going to see a sweat covered Gronk making a nice cinamatic one handed grab for a TD, followed by a signature spike.~The graphics are decent at best and gameplay physics can be annoying and silly.The Exciting Facts:~This is a Football game on Steam people. I'm not a big console guy and don't want to buy a new console just for Madden games. If you feel the same way, this game will be a great pick up for you.~NFL Mods and NCAA Mods are available for download and can be easily installed. You can play games with your NFL or college team of choice.~This has everything a football game NEEDS. You pick your play, read the opposing side and control your player to make the best plays possible for team. All basic player movements are available. Sprint, spin, dive, jump and juke are all weapons at your disposal.~You get to manage your favorite NFL or College team in a really cool Franchise mode.Overall:Isn't going to be beating Madden anytime soon, but if you are a PC gamer who loves Football and wants to be able to play a game as their favorite team every once in a while or maybe play a mock Super Bowl game or something silly this is a must purchase for you. Plus by taking the $20 chance on this game you are opening the door for Axis to be able to stand up against EA in upcoming years. With Football season around the corner and fantasy draft dates getting set I couldn't resist and expect myself to be playing a lot of this game in coming months."

For some reason they expect Madden on the PC. EA may have the budget, but Axis has the heart! This game rocks! Just finished a game wherein the PC and myself had a scoring frenzie, and it was a BLAST!!!If you are purchasing this game expecting a polished product with millions of dollars poured into it's development, then go get a console and get Madden. However, if you like football on the PC, and love the creative hearts of small software companys on a limited budget; still publishing quality games, look no further than Axis 2017. I have 2015, 2016, and now 2017; I love them all!!! Each season keeps getting just a little better. Keep up the good work!!! You guys rock!"
,Not Recommended,554750,35007179,Posted: 16 September,all,Richard Nixon,"10/3/2017 UPDATE: Just get Mutant Football League. Stay away from this. You're welcome.---This is a tough one for me, because I legitimately want to recommend this game. Every time I start it up I get a little excited, the game just looks so promising. You know it's not going to be Madden but it looks like one of those neat little PC gems with so much potential. However, pretty quickly things go off the rails.The customization options are nice, every player's skills can be modified from 1 – 99, but unless you want to make a team of absolute beasts with 99 skills all over the place what's the point? Kicking 80 yard field goals is fun at first but it obviously gets old quickly. You can also customize your team's jerseys, again pretty cool on its face, but this isn't enough to get me into the game.The actual football of this game is borderline atrocious. Players fly into the air after being tackled or, alternatively, magically dodge every tackle even when players slam directly into them. Passing with the mouse, for me at least, is rough; lotta interceptions and incompletes. There's no penalties, no trading in franchise mode, no free agents, no injuries, and I didn't play it long enough to find out but it doesn't look like there's any  kind of draft; so essentially you just play the same season over and over again, there's no progression. Also, if you ask your coach to just suggest a play on offense it doesn't even tell you if it's a pass or run play. The whole presentation of the actual game is fairly lacking as well, just bland.Overall, if this is your only choice for football I guess ... I mean... maybe? It depends on how desperate you are, and that's the key word here: desperate.  If you have Madden, stick with Madden. I know it's unfair to compare this game to Madden but what else is there to compare it to? Maybe get Blood Bowl instead, that game is fun as hell. This would've been a really fun game in the PS2 era, but even with the lowered expectations that go along with indie PC titles this just isn't worth it. Maybe next year."

The graphics are good, and the game plays really well. The franchise mode has drafts and player progressions so you can really get a sense of building your team the way you want to. The annoucing system is also really intuitive. I played NFL 2K a lot back in the day, so it was great to hear his voice again. I'm definitely happy with my purchase!"

,Recommended,554750,34299464,Posted: 16 August,all,Roberto Aguayo,This game has come so far so fast. Is it the madden killer yet? Of course not. But it does have the best customization options in a sports video game ive ever seen. I was able to create a team with full custom uniforms and logos in just an hour after learning the basics. Roster customization is also very easy. This series can very easily be the future madden killer with the right funding. The developers are constantly updating based off player feedback and the series looks promising as a whole. Don't expect a madden level depth of content but rather a fun and infinitly customizable football experience. And for $20 this game is a massive steal.

I'm playing in franchise mode right now; the gameplay is fun and graphics are a step forward as well.I'm able to play using an older Logitech Dual Action controller with no problems.I just played my 2nd game in franchise mode as Seattle. I just won a close one 17-10. The aim passing is a challenge and it's rewarding. I definitely recommend this to sports fans. I'd say don't go in thinking of Madden; it's an ejoyable football game without some of the bells and whistles of Madden type games and it's definitely nice to see this on PC.

Be warned, the game is CPU intensive.The biggest let down, however, is the player management\depth chart in franchise mode.  Having to scroll through the players one by one is incredibly frustrating, and you cannot see all of the players stats.  GIve me a madden style player management screen and dont make me have to set the depth chart for every formation, at least let me copy the base positions to each formation."

I can overlook some of the issues it has, and noticing the mod support has blown my mind. Once mods become better I would 100% say that this is a great arcade style game if you are just looking for something that is more of the old classic football games from the early 2000s.It has its problems, it has its bugs. but I truly think this company is on the front of making something truly great in just a couple more years."

But the truth is that the Dreamcast, GC, Ps2, and Original XBOX will all provide you with better football gaming experience.

76561198051756972,Recommended,554750,34326559,Posted: 18 August,all,GreyGoose987,"Allow me to describe the first game of Axis Football 2017 that I played.I beat the CPU 65-0 grant it the difficulty was on pro.I recorded 16 sacks, four turnovers and a safety.Three of the turnovers were interceptions all by one guy.14 of the 16 sacks were by one player.The defense never picked up the blitz, the offense never bothered the spy the QB.QB rushes were counted as passing yards.There are multiple instances where a defensive player would come in contact with the ball carrier and nothing would happen.Tipped passes would result in all the players flailing their arms in the air.I'd scored a touchdown resulting in a 49-0 lead and the announcer stated that I was up by two scores, this also happened when I was up 56-0.Should you buy this game…yes, a thousand times,YES!Why?  Two Reasons: The game is fun! And the game has promise.Axis Football 2015 was not worth your money but Axis Football 2017 is. I must give credit where credit is due this game has come a long way from its roots and in a few years I believe that this game has the potential to legitimately compete with Madden. Although this game is deeply flawed I see the fundamentals of football that are not present in Madden also the developer has brought their product further along in 3 years then Madden has in 10 with a pittance of the budget. I bought the game to support the developer and I would urge that you do the same."

However, when playing the game, is is far from even being close to simulating what happens in a football game. Some of the inconsistancies were laughable. I dragged a player with my feet for 20 yards, I played on hall of fame level and there were 23 interceptions in the game, and finally, the announcer kept saying that one team had a ""two-score"" lead when the game score was 49-0 !! Tecmo bowl on nintendo showed more realistic statistics. I just cannot endorse this game until they fix the gameplay and the horrible mistakes of the annouincers. The online videos by the devs said that they poured a lot of time in the franchise mode. That is a good thing...but why have a super franchise mode, when the statistics are all crazy? Why carry a team through season after season averaging 20 plus interceptions in a 20-minute game? This game has more potential in customizing and mods than Madden ever dreamed of having...but unless they make game statistics believable... they will never replace that franchise."

The growth and features of the game have grown exponentially in the three years this game has been on the market.  The developer is EXTREMELY helpful and actually listens to his customer base to make the game better.  I purchased this game every year, without playing a demo just to support the developers and to assist them in finding the holy grail of graphic football simulators, namely, a replacement for Football Pro 98.

On the the other hand, you can play football on your PC and have a fun experience with this game - something I can't do with NCAA 2012 (console only).   This game is missing a lot of features that would be standard in the big console releases (audibles, separate divisions/conferences/season player stats) but the developers are ambitious and plan on adding these and many other features to the series eventually.Personally I will get my $20 out of this title - this is the first year that a ""franchise mode"" is included and that feature ensures that I'll play a season or two.  In general I would recommend this game while acknowledging its' limitations.  It is possible that this series will become a deep, entertaining, highly customizable PC football game in the next few years and that goal is worth throwing twenty bucks towards right now.  Plus I will play a few dozen games, so that isn't too bad for a budget title when I don't feel like messing with my Xbox!"

Finally one has arrived.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game.  It's a nice try but falls way short of expectations.  And I wasn't expecting a Madden experience just some decent fun gameplay.What ruined it for me....---Computer player does not do what you expect from a real game experience.  For example, my computer opponent was on their 1 yard line on 4th down in a tied game with all 3 timeouts remaining with 2 minutes to go.  In real life that team would punt the ball, try and stop the other team to get the ball back and try to win or get to overtime.  Therefore I did what anyone would do...select a play for a punt return.  But the computer faked a punt and gained 50 yards (by running up the middle!) and ultimately won the game.  This is so unrealistic and laughable that it ruined all the fun I had up to that point.  The gameplay should be reality based.---The graphics are substandard.  Too many players run around in circles or all over the field like they don't know what they are doing...chasing ghosts.---The announcers are repetitive and make comments not relevant to what is happening on the field.---Not enough customization available for creating your own league.  You can't limit the number of teams, create your own divisions, etc.  You can't change names of cities or teams or players.  Editing uniforms is very limited unless you open up files and hex editors and try to edit funky looking graphics on the screen instead of pointing and clicking on a part of the uniform and just selecting a color...very cumbersome!  I want total control of how I want to play...as advertised but not fulfilled.Anyway, I'm requesting a refund but am open to buying a future version if things improve."

Customization (for most developers) means in game capabilities. The uniform editor in game is exceedingly limited, you can't even change uniform colors in game ! The player editor is a joke---you cannot change the players name, when you do and save to file it reverts to what it was previously.  Don't oversell your game---as a first time purchaser with high but reasonable hopes you have lost me for all future releases----I can't believe what you claim is in your game !!"

After recieving the kick, my returner teleported away from the ball, allowing the ball to exit the end zone. This gave the other team a touchdown for some reason.
