Masky brings it in with being a balance dancing game as you collect more and mor people to bring up your score.GameplayAlthough Masky describes it as a dancing game, I'd take it as more of a balancing game. With the simple balancing mechanics that anyone can easily pick up without a tutorial. However, with it being advertised as a dancing game, it can easily be misinterpreted to a dancing game rather than what the gameplay actually is.Each round starts with your character in the middle with two other figures on each side of you. All you have to do is walk towards them to join hands, comtinuing till you lose your balance. As you play more, and try to take a shortcut, you see the balance is connected to the pople you have. Go grab people from the same side and it'll become difficult to stay upright as it drifts to that side. So adjusting to have somewhat the same amount of people on each side is advisable to stay on your feet. Of course as the line gets bigger and bigger it will also becoe difficult to stay upright.To balance this out the game will spawn doors, both to bring you to another theme and to lighten your load. The kicker is the special masks that activates certain effects that can either be helpful or not. Ranging from it cutting off some people to putting your screen upside down. This is characterized early by a red arrow and later by what mask the don once you add them to your line.Single vs Multi-PlayerWith the basic gameplay out of the way let's see how playing by yourself and playing with others is the same or differs. A leveling system is integrated to give you more mask designs, coming with it's own music (guarenteed starter music if you're in single player) that shows up in the game. It also shows feet, which increases the more levels you go up, which I believe gives you more workaround with your balancing. And while you can try to achieve this in single player by just trying to get as many dancers to join you, multiplayer is much more enjoyable.Leveling up with playing online is actually pretty fun. Especially if you happen along someone that is leveling up just like you. Instead of getting the most dancers, multiplayer focuses on a race between three others (bots will fill in for the missing spots) to get a chain of 25. Winning 3 rounds declares you the winner. Dependsing if you win or lose, skill points and your rank will either go down or up.The split-screen nature doesn't really help you but others to tempt you into looking, but you can guess where they are by the sounds each thing makes that you can hear. The bots is really difficult to beat, seeming to mostly do better than what you do.SoundThe music that goes along with each theme is catchy and great. It doesn't call you attention but lightly pats you as you try to balance. The tempo goes along with how you are doing rather than it being set. The sound effects for the special masks or going through doors stands out from the music easily. So if you are in multiplayer, you can sneakily track the others.VisualsYou can't just look at the screenshots but look at the gameplay. As it keeps moving rather than standing still most of the time. Everything, except the masks, are outlined in a specific color based on the theme giving a basic representation of the body type. The background also uses this, but it has moving parts. It is very eye catching which is great but can distract you from the task in hand.PerformanceDo not worry about performance with Masky! It doesn't lag or have any major problems with connecting to others. Everything is really easy to manage and go through. If you want to quickly launch it and go in, it is very easy.ReplayabilityIt only lasts as long as you want to play. You can easily stop at the max level. If there was more of an online presence it would hold more replayabiltity. But after you max out you can try to beat your high score chain.Overall+ Art+ Music+ Integrating mask abilities and how many people with the balancing aspect+ Cheap price+/- Multiplayer only achievements- Bots adding up the difficultyMasky is simple that anyone will be able to pick up and get after a few minutes. Balancing may seem too easy at first but gets harder and harder as you progress. The only thing that may not be great, other than the bots, is the multiplayer only acheievements. Not many people play online, so they can easily be hard to get (not to mention having bots replace some spots). Which is a shame due to how fun it is to level up with someone else and the cheap price it's set at. But otherwise I recommend this. ANd if you happen to know a friend looking for a cheap multiplayer game, level up with them!"

My boyfriend said that, on paper, this game probably looked so basic and silly, it's a wonder it got created.It's a game of balance, with random occurrences thrown in every now and then to screw with you, depending on what mask-wearing peeps you tag with. The graphics and music are terrific, and the mechanics are smooth. What's really great about Masky is the 4-player, split-screen mode. Plug in 4 controllers and get ready for some fun with family or friends, local or online. It's just as much fun and frustrating to watch others play, as well.8/ 10You won't bemoan your 0.99 spent, guaranteed!"

As a sucker for cute, quirky art and tunes, I thought I should give Masky a try. Besides, I need more super duper casual game on my list.Simple Concept & Gameplay with emphasis on Coordination & BalanceWhile Masky is being branded as a dance game, I agree with other reviewers it's different: Unlike most dance games that are associated with rhythm & beat, Masky relies on balance, momentum/resistance, directional controls, and visual responses to changing environment instead:You will find that if you collect too many dancers on one side (eg. Left side), your group will gravitate towards the left.Environment will change eg. backdrop, as well as by collecting ""active"" masks: eg. Speed up movement, or inverse dirctionsSome of my overall positve experienceIncredibly easy to learn and navigateResponsiveFun, quirky art style, Changing environment can look trippyFun little tunes to dance to (edit:I caught myself humming the strange tunes at work).Good for if you want to play a super casual game without commitmentLove how the game pre-scream for you when you fail, so you don't have to scream.Other PotentialsPossibly enjoyable for casual game players who are prone to acquiring highest score/perfect level game play/must-get-better-this-time mentalityCan be a part of a fun party game curation especially with a few drinks inConsSimilar to the downfall of multiple games, the online playerbase is small or non existent. Although it's built to have online multiplayer option, I don't anticipate that people would use this function.Conclusion:Unlike a 99 cents peepshow, this game actually delivers entertainment instead of a tease. No, I don't mind you taking my monies: I have been thoroughly entertained by this."

There's no sort of progression in the game play, just the same thing over and over.You balance by moving left or right picking up more people. Having more people on one side will make you lean towards the other side and so on. That's pretty much it."

Masky is perfect if you ask me. It's crazy, has awesome music and the visuals really stick out to me.I've always loved bright colours on stark black background, in fact a lot of my artwork is like that. So yeah, this game seems like it was made for me because of the colour design and its simple but addicted gameplay too!It's only a dollar so why not give it a try? I found it to be very fun at least!"

,Recommended,554800,35392248,Posted: 1 October,all,fizzy flask,"An extremely simplistic balancing game with no tutrotial. That being said, it is oddly addiciting. By playing, you can unlock more masks which give you a different song to listen while you balance your way into forming the largest dance group. Some masks up the difficulty and make it harder to balance as well. Overall it is a $1 game and it is well worth the pricetag. I wouldn't pay more that $5 for it due to how simplistic the game play is. But it is addicting and I keep feeling like I can get a higher score next time and immediately want to try again after I fail. This game is worth it if you enjoy high score chasing and need something to play that you dont need to think about too heavily. Though with no tutorial it may take you a bit to figure out how to play, but you should have it figured out within the first half hour. The game also has cute character designs and frequent changing backgrounds. So art wise the game is still simplistic but interesting. :-)"
