76561197970371516,Recommended,555010,29321610,Posted: 17 January,all,Mavor,"Several missions in and I can say Im really happy so far. MERCs metagame plays essentially like Xcom - missions come and go as time goes by, mercs need to be healed of injuries, equipment must be bought and divvied up, new mercs hired and such.The tactical gameplay revolves around your two man Alpha and Beta teams that make up your overall squad. You can give orders seperately to both teams, or control them together as a whole - currently, unless I completely missed it, there is no way to control a single merc. Tactical play is real time with a slow time mechanic for when things get hectic - it boils down to proper cover usage, squad abilities and not letting missiles hit you in the face...My only real gripe right now is the use of left mouse for some things and right for other. Some cover requires RMB, some LMB. All targetting is LMB - but I instinctively want to use RMB for that and often end up sending my squad running at the enemy instead of gunning them down.Overall, for my hours worth of play and 3-4 missions Ive been thru - Im really looking forward to more. Its got a great cyberpunk setting (Im a huge cyberpunk fan so this is a big deal for me) and the gameplay and logistics are already enough to be fun and engaging. The addition of co-op play is icing on the cake for me. Also - for a game in its alpha stage, it seems way further along than most betas.Imagine Xcom and Syndicate Wars had a kid and you get the idea =)"

Not too shabby, quite fun really.It's early access, I believe it was just released today. It's in need of intro missions and tutorials as well as some voice acting, but they really nailed the gameplay. Some fleshing out of the story would be good, too. As it stands, I wasn't too certain what to do or where to look on the mission/map screen or what the signifigance of what everything is. But, as mentioned, it's early access. Likely that's to get the studio a bit of cash to reinvest into the game.Nice graphics and sound with some tight writing and level design.Glad I purchased and I look forward to seeing what this becomes."

It can zoom in and out harshly depending on the angle your at and what is behind/above you.Healing/Medical care is hard to gauge/understandNo in-mission healing mechanic availabe from start, left up to RNJesus from drops until a random soldier with the right class and talent appears in hiring screenYour line of sight when tucked in cover is abysmal while enemies can shoot through damn near anythingSoldiers don't open fire on the enemy automatically unless they are shot which makes no sense unless you're cloakedOverall:I like it and I want it to work/be fun.  I'm hoping the Devs continue working through to really polish the UI/controls.  With further updates I would fersure review and change my rating."

,Not Recommended,555010,31129555,Posted: 13 April,all,Atomic Gandhi,"Your soldiers do not shoot unless they are shot at, or unless your order them to. This means a significant part of the micro is you just left clicking trash enemies, something which your troopers should really do automatically: Focus fire should be a strategy used against particular enmies, not a hassle that you have to continually manage.This is the same critical error in gameplay design that similar game Satellite reign makes, which reduced much of the combat to left clicking people, which gives you less time to focus on actual strategy."
,Recommended,555010,29885544,Posted: 12 February,all,German for Monkey,"I see a lot of reviews comparing this game to XCOM, which isn't really accurate at all (I blame the cover shield icons). There are definitely some similarities on the macro scale re: squad management and mission selection, but the minute-to-minute gameplay is much closer to a squad-scale loot-based RTS like Dawn of War 2. I liked the focus on small, discrete engagements rather than constant run-and-gun action - it definitely feels like the game rewards smart play. Catching some fools out of cover and mowing them down is very satisfying, but if you get cocky and try to rush a fortified position, you are probably just as screwed.Being an early access game, there are definitely some rough edges, especially around the character loadout and skill tree UIs, but so far I think this game has a lot of promise."

People are comparing it to XCom, but that is not very accurate comparison. The game is real time, which in my opinion makes you connect less with your soldiers as you don't have the crucial ""Please hit this shot Billy!"" moments.I played with a friend for all my missions, which means splitting loot and therefore having to compete twice as many missions to keep progressing in the game.The stability of this game is not good. In the 3.4 hours played the game crashed 4 times, which made us fail missions and lose reputation with certain factions.If you want to see some co-op gameplay click here, we recorded a bit before getting angry at crashes"
76561198078232031,Recommended,555010,29391936,Posted: 20 January,all,Freezing,"This is a good game but there are things that it really needs to improve on, before being sold.-Your squad members die fast, even in cover.-I have not seen a variety in map style-The maps are styled like diablo 3, but without the minimap. You can probably guess how this would become a hassle after a few missions.-The way cover works in this game is frusturating-Your units look the same, walk the same, START walking at EXACTLY the same time, etc. This greatly takes away from the immersion for me.-Pathfinding, my units choose to spend 5 seconds taking turns jumping over a crate, rather than take 1 second to run around it.-You can flank an enemy, but unless you're almost directly behind them, your damage towards them will be as if they were in cover, unflanked.-A few other small problems.I know this is an early access game, but if its for sale, then it will be treated like a finished product.I have only reviewed this as ""Positive"" because the devs need a chance to improve things."
,Recommended,555010,29321406,Posted: 17 January,all,Velvety,This is a cool blend of tactical and real-time squad battle. Lots of choice and variety for play styles. The dark and futuristic mood and theme are great too!

,Not Recommended,555010,29449927,Posted: 23 January,all,Linxwire,"This game is decent, however I do not reccomend it in it's current state.Pros-Well crafted universe.Interesting concept.Looks okayNo performance issues to noteCons-No options for dificulty whatsoever, only a choice of poisions so to speak.Randomized missions can make the lack of diffculty choices worse, especially early on.Multiplayer can actually put you at a disadvantage in your own campaign.Randomization of missions leads the game to also feel needlessly maze-like, as there is no minimap.Explaining a bit about the cons, mulitplayer in game only permits you to take half of your normal forces into a mission with another player, but due to this, you soldiers still are affected as normal and only they gain xp/get injured. At the start of the game you have the bare minimum soldiers possible, so when you go into multiplayer and half of your forces become underleveled as a result, or can't return to battle to do injuries, that puts a big halt on your early game progress. I have no idea how much that affects the late game, but I'm willing to bet it's not great.I would say if you really want to pick this game up, give it some time. It's still under development, and until some things change it's not very enjoyable. I have faith it'll become much better with time."

If you like tactical strategy games, then this is the game for you. Haven't came across and glitches or bugs that are gamebreaking so far. Full character customization all the way down to the boot. Each class also has a skill tree in which you can pick different abilities for your character as well."
,Recommended,555010,29336739,Posted: 18 January,all,Croutonkid,"It is fun! M.E.R.C. satisfies the base need of games by being fun and satisfying. For an early access game, this is incredibly fleshed out and pretty. There is good tactical gameplay that feels punishing but fair that had me coming back even after gettinga game over after just a week of in-game time. What is missing are quality of life features, such as being able to quickly cycle through mercenaries and change their gear or abilities, but these will come with time. Finally, I hope that voide acting will be added to supplement to clever writing for some characters."
76561198155387266,Not Recommended,555010,32784246,Posted: 25 June,all,mvlaplante,"Best part of the game is the graphics, although it's simply window-dressing as you cannot enter buildings, open doors unless they are specific to the story.  That's it, that's all that I've found good about this.  Mercs are ugly and you have no customization ability.Squad control is where this game falls horribly flat.  Very clunky camera controls and, even worse, switching between squads in order to try and flank enemy units is a nightmare and potentially game ending when your unit becomes blocked by the un-interactive scenery and you can no longer see the enemy units to fire at them.  Your mercs will not fire at enemy units unless you tell them to engage.You go from a very simplistic tutorial into a hard-core, very unforgiving story-mode/side missions.  And the scenarios are all-or-nothing.  If you do not successfully complete the mission you get zip, zero, nothing.  There's three hours of your life you won't get back.Not sorry that I paid money for a game that I've already deleted off my computer.  I don't mind helping game developers put new products on  the market.  But this game is very frustrating and the fun-factor is about equal to a bent-brick.  The form is there, but you just can't use it."

Decided to buy this on a whim and it's great! I love the real-time aspect of the game, it never gets boring that way or well, it feels more fluent that way. No lag, no glitches - awesome for a early access game.There are abilities, weapons, armors, etcs so there's definitely a feeling of progression every time you complete a level.As opposed to X-COM, it does have a lower level of strategy not being turn based but it's still exciting.Just when I thought it was getting easy....I could see it becoming difficult as well past the first level of course.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_ED0TfLUuk"
76561198086248608,Recommended,555010,30024936,Posted: 18 February,all,Rdshrk,"M.E.R.C. is a game where you manage a mercenary company. Every missions, you can deploy 4 differents characters (2 in alpha squad, 2 in bravo squad). You can't control each unit individualy but rather you give command to each squad. You have 4 different classes: heavy, assault, sniper and engineer, with 4 possibles sub classes, such as medic and hacker (the only ones i've seen as of yet). There is coop where you can do a mission with a friend or random person and everybody control theirs alpha squad, which looks like it could be fun to play with a friend (havent found a coop mission yet, the lobby was always empty).If you have read other reviews, you might have seen many comments comparing M.E.R.C. to XCom. While I do find a ressemblance in certain aspects (main map where you review missions, the barrack where you can see your units, etc.), I really wouldn't compare to that myself, meaning don't buy this game because you liked XCom but don't pass on it because you disliked it either.The game has many strong points and many flaws aswell, but given that it is in early access, I have strong hope that the flaws will be corrected and worked upon. Here is a list of the points that I like and what I feel the game should improve.The good:-4 differents classes and 4 subclasses give many different options but I feel they could have more than 2 active skills per classes (example: The assault class has grenade and a firing supression skill, and that's it. There are a few passives that modify skills, like the poison grenades, but I feel in the end, every assault is just the same).-Seems to have many different pieces of chest armor, leg, helmet and weapons that you can find and buy. Weapons are restricted to classes but they have various stats.-Armor you equip does show on your character (there are no customization like you had in XCom to choose a character's appearance yet, not sure if they want to add that).-Combat is fast and animation are fluid. It always feel satisfying to watch a squad of ennemies explode when you shoot barrels or throw grenade at them.-Graphics looked good enough for me (I started playing video game with the first doom on MS-DOS so I dont care too much about that. But they look nice enough).-I think the story for the game is interesting. Not sure how much it gets developped as I've only finished the first few 'storyline' mission but I felt it was worth reading instead of skipping all the time.The 'will require more work in the future': As I said, I'm sure it will be worked on at some point, but if you find those would ruin your experience, then you can decide to delay your purchase until they've had a few more updates in the game.-I feel the music is very repetitive. I felt like turning it off after my game session.-AI is extremely dump. They will take cover on the side of barricades that are facing you (meaning you shoot them in the back), they will start running at you and get insta killed all the time. Once I threw a grenade at a patrol over a wall, almost killing them all. They fell to the ground, stood back up and continued their patrol like nothing happened. Sometimes ennemies will shoot at the wall with rockets, not even damaging you, instead of moving to another cover.-Talking of cover: If your guys have no line of sight to the ennemies, they'll just stand there and do nothing when you ask them to fire. Moving to the nearest place with a LOS would have been nice.-Your guys will often stay idle while you have ennemies running around them at almost melee distance. They do fire back when fired upon though.-Opening a container makes your character stuck there until you close the container manualy (if there is an item you cant take in it). if you dont see it right away, you get into fights with only 3 guys realizing that the other one is still at the box, 100m away.-When you recruit a new unit, you cant know what his subclass is. In fact, if you try to see its skill tree, it cause other bugs that you need to reload the game or go do a mission to fix.-There is no difficulty setting. I found myself instantly killing any ennemies as far as the edge of my screen after the first few missions where I bought assault rifles that deals more damage than the best sniper I can buy.-Sniper class feel very underpowered. Even their headshot ability wont kill enemies in 1 or 2 hits (you have only 2-3 uses of it per mission unless you find more as loot).-Ennemies can detect you from outside of your screen or sometimes from the other side of a wall with no LOS.-Many many more (even though I listed quite a bunch of things, those werent harsh enough to make me want to refund this game).I have found no game breaking bugs at all so far.Conclusion: I would still recommand to buy this game, as I am sure it will only get better, with more features and bug cleaning. Game might be more fun if you have someone else to play with."

Sometimes there is not enough room, sometimes there is but still sometimes one stands behind the other. That needs fixing when there is enough room, the other should stand next in cover.When there is not enough room even if I press cover at that spot, they should find there own cover. Even if I press cover at that spot, so they know that spot wont cover both, and the last one should find a new cover.The enemies also need to do this, the Ai needs improvement. this will make it harder, right now its easy :)Overall the game is good with these changes I said wow, wow it will be fenominal."

Pulling back to cover to regroup, and then rush the enemy so that they can reload their gun once under fire. Trying to take cover so that the sniper misses and instead your unit shoots at the sniper, misses every shot, and then dies. Have a unit with 85% accuracy shoot at the wall about 5 feet away from your target. Its fun, its got potential, maybe theres a control im missing, but I don't enjoy watching my units get shot by snipers through walls. Its hard to retreat because the camera is locked to your units."

I will keep my old review below, which pretty much sums up the current state of the game, however, don't expect new features. Quite frankly, I don't expect the game to ever release and I can see that it'll disappear off Steam again in the near future. Also, the game constantly crashes.**Old review**So far, the game is great. I've definitely been enjoying it.At the moment, though, I can't play for extended periods of time due to the game crashing, BUT, speaking with Chris, one of the developers (who by the way, responded to my support email within a few minutes of me sending it!), the game has good things coming, and they are addressing the crashing issues.Other than the crashes, there isn't much that is gamebreaking, and so far I seem to be one of the lucky few who crash as often.For an E/A title, there's a surprising amount of content, with randomly generated timed side missions that you can play co-op and main story missions, you have tons of content to get your teeth stuck into.So it all boils down to this listPROS -Loads of contentCo-op gameplay for side missionsSkill customisationEquipment progressionReal strategic gameplayCONS -Somewhat repetitive go here and kill that, EVACI wanted to stick in that there isn't much of a choice when it comes to weapons and armors, but that's likely to the game being an E/A title."
