It's a lot of running (request: autorun) and and it can get boring quick, but it's also relaxing and at times breathtaking.Another downside is that the game is only saved at the start of each level instead of where you exit and that you can only save one playthrough, so you can't have multiple people play the game.Despite these few shortcomings (and let's face it, this is 45 minutes after initial release) this is all in all a tremendous game for exploration game enthusiasts."

,Recommended,555150,34953802,Posted: 14 September,all,errade,"So I've just finished this lovely game. It took me just under an hour and a half non-stop. It left me with that lingering feeling of awe, something similar to how Abzu and Journey left me feeling.What a beautiful game to look at though. The use of colour and light is gorgeous and there were 3 or 4 particular moments in the game that really popped - I won't spoil it for you here.The voice acting and narration was very well done, the voices were soft and the recording was crystal clear. More importantly the acting sounded genuine and not forced.It's not all great, the jump mechanics and animations are a little wonky and there were two or three occasions where I lost my way and didn't know where to go. But this entire game was made by one guy on his own, it doesn't have a team of developers or deep resources behind it.Let's not pretend it's a triple A title like Journey, but For £5 it's a very worthy use of 1.5 hours. Don't expect action and explosions. Clear your mind, sit down, let the story unfold slowly at its own pace.Once you find the rhythm of the game and the visuals and audio start to wash over you the experience is really a lovely thing."

This game was directed by one individual; produced by one individual and written by one individual. The first Tree didn't set out to be the next hit Telltale game or AAA title. It set out to tell a beautiful story and did so perfectly. Taking the player on a heart-warming and relaxing adventure in which you'll be lost in the breath-taking scenery, tear-jerking story and the atmospheric soundtrack. We should be commending David Wehle for dedicating years of his life to constructing a game that was very short but its impact permanent. Having waited months for the release, thank you David for making it worth every second."

It is short, but having lost my dad recently, this made me very emotional. It is a very slow-paced game but after you get through the first bit of it, you start to follow the story and want to find out more. It made me cry and the story is sad, but it touched my heart."

Sure there are a few hitches, for example the movement not being as a fluid, and I found a small bug interacting with some platforms where I couldn't jump afterwards (classic unity bug), but personally I didn't find this impacted my experience at all. Another suggestion would be more ambient music playing in the background whilst running along as the fox. But overall, I'm very pleased I found this gem, I love story games like this and David did an excellent job, can't wait for your next piece of work."

There are prettier games out there and also technically better executed ones, but none that I know that deliver so much heart in such a short time.The artstye is pretty simple and stylized, what makes it look very nice and colorfull. The soundtrack is simple and great!Also the voice acting is really good and manages to deliver the feelings of the protagonists.There are a few little things, that could be done better, but those aren't in the way of enjoying the journey.All I have left to say is... well done.

76561198071521144,Recommended,555150,34977649,Posted: 15 September,all,XXXTentacion,"""The First Tree"" is one of the most unique games I've played. I originally bought this game to remove an awkward $8 from my wallet. What I received was a thoroughly interesting story told through unique methods which further entice the player.Pros:-The story is well written, and (without spoiling), David Wehle does an amazing job at telling an emotional story, and speaking personally, did a brilliant job with the pacing. This can be described by the popularly coined ""walking simulator"", but the pacing was well done to the point where the walking didn't seem boring, and the distance wasn't long enough to disengage the player from the story.-The visuals are absolutely mesmerising. The game does an exceptional job at using light and shadows to create a vibrant and beautiful landscapes. Whether it's a starlit night sky, or an Autumn grassland, this game is an artistic masterpiece, and fully immerses the player in the game.-The soundtrack for this game really impressed. The music was composed by Josh Kramer (with other musicians contributing in part, but primarily by Kramer), who seems to have a brilliant understanding of how to use music to evoke strong feelings of sadness and nostalgia with a powerful score. Music can be an area which is subjective to a lot of people, so it can be hard to unanimously impress, but the overwhelming result in the review section agrees that this soundtrack is astonishing, and I am yet to hear a negative complaint.You can tell a lot of energy and care went into this game, and it really reflects.I genuinely can't think of any cons of this game. However, there are factors to be considered before purchase.-This is a game with a particular niche. This is a storytelling game which excels at what it aims to do. However, if you are more of an action based player, this might not be a game you will enjoy. It mainly consists of walking from point A-B. You may find it boring if you expect it to be an action game or one with multiple functions, but the devs dont lie about what it is. If you purchase expecting it to be a massive game with gruelling action, it's your fault.-The playtime for this game is short. I completed it in 1.3 hours. I would replay it in the same sense as I would re-read a book: knowing how it ends, but to relive the experience I had reading it prior, to a slightly dulled extent. If you don't want to spend the money on what is essentially a 1 hour game, that is understandable. However, I don't regret buying it in the slightest, and would encourage others to buy it.Overall, this is one of the best storytelling games I've ever played. The entire team obviously cared about it a lot. Everythng, from the voice acting to the design is very well done, and thinking of real, unambiguous cons felt really forced. HOWEVER, the $8 pricetag is a bit excessive for a 1.3 hour game, and I would encourage to wait until a sale to buy it if money is an issue. I would absolutely recommend this game to someone looking for a short game with a big reward. However, I would encourage one to think before purchase to make sure it fits their desired criteria.8/10"
,Recommended,555150,35011563,Posted: 16 September,all,Shredder,"I have mixed feelings about this game, but ultimately recommend it if you enjoy walking simulators. The atmosphere and feel of this game was amazing, and I really liked the art style. The story was good, if not a bit short, but I really liked the message, and I enjoyed the ending.The most polarizing thing about this game, however, is that it rewards exploration inconsistently. On the one hand, there are 150 little pieces of light in the game, many of which involve going very out of your way to find, so the game is imploring the player to explore. But on the other hand, I would sometimes get genuinely lost and have to start the level over to find out where I was.I'm going to be a bit vague here to avoid spoilers, but this is especially a problem in a couple of the later levels where you are expected to follow something to get to your destination. I lost track of the thing I was following and got completely lost in giant patches of forest that had no apparent reason for being there. After twenty minutes, I restarted the level and followed more closely.Other than that, I enjoyed the game quite a bit, and would recommend it for players who like this style of game. Recognize that it's short, though. Many players report beating it in about an hour. I went out of my way to do things like find the edge of the world, or find glitches to climb mountains I was not supposed to be able to climb and get to areas I was not supposed to be in, and I still only played for about 3 hours. If that's okay with you, pick the game up; otherwise, wait for a sale or pick it up in a bundle later."

If you like narrative games, walking simulators, or just cute foxes and gorgeous visuals, this is the game for you. There's even a nice hidden bonus if you played his first game! Amazing work, I'm a fan for life."
,Recommended,555150,34955836,Posted: 14 September,all,2k1p,"I haven't finished The First Tree yet, simply because I don't want it to end too soon. So, first of all: Yes, I can highly recommend that game, but not to anyone. Why? Because it's not exactly an action-adventure, it's not really a puzzle, it's not a fox simulator (to say it in the words of the developer)... If you're expecting that kind of game, you might be disappointed. Though if you're a fan of Firewatch or Shelter, like exploring and can appreciate love for detail and a beautifully created little world with stunning atmosphere, great soundtrack and (so far) deep story, you're going to love that game! When you encounter bugs (which I haven't yet) keep in mind that The First Tree was created by just one developer, who obviously put a LOT of effort and love into his project and I've played games that weren't even half that good but created by a horde of developers.I've been waiting half a year for The First Tree to be released and all the waiting paid off."

It really is a beautiful game, with perhaps an even more beautiful message.I wouldn't really call The First Tree fun to play. It was very challenging to collect some of the stars and I ended up giving up on some of the ones you had to jump for simply because it was such a pain. I suppose that's the whole point, though, that parents go out of their way to do things for their children. There were times when I got bored running across the map looking for things, and despite all this running around I did things out of order and I missed a major part of the fox's story which I was super bummed about. It messed up the experience for me quite a bit but I still got the message and it still grabbed my heart to the point of tears. The point is not to have fun, though, but to listen to a story while experiencing it within another. In other words, you experience the main story through the fox's journey. It does this very well.The music is what makes this game as successful as it is. It's slightly forced but very powerful nonetheless. Not to discredit other aspects of the game, because the landscapes are simply gorgeous. The most exciting thing was to come up over the top of a hill and look out on a beautiful horizon with new lands to continue my journey on.I would not recommend this game to someone who is looking for action-packed adventure. This game is not for the shallow or the impatient. Wait for a sale.I would, however,  recommend this game to someone who can see beauty in nature and enjoys taking their time, or anyone who is going through a rough point in their life. This game is very hopeful and positive, it may help you if you are stuck and can't move forward.~~~"

The downside however is that I felt punished for exploring, because the music does not loop and the running around gets tedious really fast since you only hear footsteps and a litte bit of ambience for a great amount of time until you hit the next level/area.I can forgive the bugs and that I fell through the map once. This is a one-man-project after all.The story was pretty mediocre for me, yet a lot of people seem to like it. I finished the game and was underwhelmed.I played Journey and Abzu and this game doesn't even get close to them in my opinion. So I can't recommend it if you are searching an experience like that."
,Recommended,555150,35089916,Posted: 20 September,all,McSteebler,"The First Tree is a one-man-band production done created by David Wehle. It’s a simple story about a dream that the narrator has of a fox searching for it’s missing family. Small clues link to the narrator's life and the relationship he has with his dad. The story is subtle and is told in small chunks as you explore the worlds that are presented you. I have to complement the art style and atmosphere of the game, overall things looks very pretty. Considering that a one-man team created all of this, I have to tip my virtual hat to David for his artistic efforts. The controls play smooth and are easy for anyone to use - experienced and new gamers alike. The mechanics are simple and require you to dig up certain objects and scale certain cliffs across your short journey. Speaking of Journey, those love games like Journey or Firewatch will enjoy this game. The First Tree has heart, it has story, and it has a moving musical score. The game took me under 2 hours to complete but at $7.99, cheaper than a movie ticket, I felt like I got my moneys worth. If you’re in the mood for a short n sweet adventure with heart, The First Tree is for you."

Screw those children you're supposed to be looking for, wooden trains are cooler.All in all I think it's worth ten bucks, but only if you specifically want a good story, not exciting gameplay. I'd only really play this if I wanted to relax, but given I have other games for that, I don't really have a need for it. I think I'd be interested if the game got more things and activities wheren't limited to prop-hunting, but until then I'll keep watching and my money. I wish there was an ""Ehhh"" rating."

Great voice actors, music and sounds in total. Perfect for chilling and playing for heart. Feels same as reading a book.Bad sides are not really good controls (sometimes the fox gets stuck in mountains while jumping) and the lack of information. There are moments when it's pretty hard to understand what to do and the game gives you no clues.8/10, recommendedFor those who came here for more information I can say this:This story is very deep. Some may not like it, for some ""other's sorrow is boring and pointless"" but... The First Tree may teach us something important, open our eyes and help us to find out what is really happening. Our past life can be terrible... make us cry and want to leave this world but... It's a past. We can't change it. But we can change the present. We can make our own future. And there will always be somebody on the path who will follow us, whose voice will fill us with strenght. For who we will be ready to move further.

I loaded into it excited but that was soon quelled by the difficulty in several areas that shouldn't be difficult. The camera is difficult to control and swings wildly at the slightest touch. When jumping onto an object if you don't get it exactly right you'll end up on the side of a rock or some such object, no longer able to move your fox and having to wait until it has slid down the side of the rock. The jump is also difficult to control in general and it seems that you can't really time it properly - I felt like I was lining myself up correctly and should reach the snowflake I was trying to collect but then the fox would plummet to the ground just short. The voice acting was the kicker for me though with some of the sentences sounding forced and the acting not praticularly convincing. It felt kind of like drama class back when I was at school when two people were super trying hard, but just not pulling it off.With all that said, it is a very beautiful game and the music is pretty, but it just wasn't enough for me to like this."
,Recommended,555150,34978081,Posted: 15 September,all,Swevenfox,"After the patches I would give a new review of the game.First of all the game is beautiful and very atmospheric where the player can equally relax and just enjoy. I would say it is partially a walking simulator with minimal objectives - just enough to make the game more interesting but not too heavy to distract you from the actual message and what depth it carries.I still not that much fan of the jumping physics but you can get around with a bit of practice and even if you missed some stars there is no spot you can't climb back up with patience to try it again until you get it :^)Honestly bless the climbing options I missed a lot of jumps but the concept of giving opportunity to still get them with climbing up even if it was narrowy helped a lot.I love the zone's colour choice, the mood they build and the way the dream merging with the story giving hints and more concept to the player.It is short sadly I could enjoy it a lot longer as the graphic is amazing for it. My biggest complain is the lack of music. The soundtrack it has is amazing but not getting looped while the player dicovering the zone and its secrets. It goes very silent which in my opinion is really bad for a game building in atmosphere mainly. It easily makes the player discoonect of the actual feelings especially if they get frustrated by star collecting or so.Music is powerful and for mood based games is essential as it helpd the player come across the frustration or stuck parts without loosing the essence of the game.Additionally I was a bit sad that mechanic introduced in a zone never returned in later zones (especially the second zone) nor made variety mechanics shown in each zone to counter that if the author not planned that to come back in later zones."

It's well written, works with the voice acting, and has a message. This is one of those few games that does that right. Very little of it though, is told through visual cues it seems, which --- while a weak point, is not a turn-off.As for the gameplay, most of it is walking around collecting stars. There's no death, no enemies, no Real challenges. The only part I was challenged at was the 3rd zone, but that was only because I couldnt find the rock. The platforming isnt utterly boring though, and the stars do make a story difference in the end.Overall I'm not sure how I feel about this game. I think this developer could definitely go somewhere, but I dont think this game did. Maybe just find the Dev's patreon or something and donate $5(I dont know if the dev has one, you can ask someone), if you want to support them."

,Not Recommended,555150,34987426,Posted: 15 September,all,greenlotad,"Since everyone is comparing this game to Journey and Abzu, I guess I will too. It's similar enough. In graphics, the game is perhaps a bit less impressive and less detailed, but pretty similar. It's less optimized though, with some framerate tanks during heavy foliage. The music is pretty good, but doesn't loop. After a while the music ends and you just have environmental sounds. Unlike those games, there's voiceover in this one. It's not the best I've heard but it doesn't hurt the experience. Unfortunately, there isn't much flow between the animation, movement, and controls. It just feels and looks kinda off. And sometimes the fox will just kinda freeze when you try to jump on a boulder or something. There's a lot of invisible wall syndrome. Also the game does not handle transitions between stages as gracefully; there are blank loading screens. All of these things though can be contributed to a smaller team and budget (I assume) than those games, and I would say it is forgivable. What I find harder to forgive though is that the game doesn't do a good job of showing you where to go and/or how to get there. I just found myself meandering around jumping on things until I could continue instead of immersing myself in experience. The music cutting out and janky animations didn't help with that. One of the most important parts of Journey and Abzu was the fluidity of movement and how it they just subconsciously told you where to go through visuals and auditory design, and this game just lacks that in it's design. And that is why I can't reccommend this game, why I'm not going to finish it, and why I'll be returning it."

The story is insufficient, boring, and pointless, and in this game, where gameplay is ""jumping poorly on to platforms"", the story is ALL it has. This walking simulator is neither interesting or fun to play, and I love walking simulators. I have a huge tattoo of a fox. I love foxes. Playing as a fox should make me rate this a 10/10, but the game was so bad and so self indulgent, and so boring that I didn't even enjoy that aspect.On top of that, there were MAJOR game breaking bugs that I experienced that were repeatable and completely crashed the game. Was this even play tested?I've played indie games that are 10 hours that cost 3 dollars. The cost, plus the unplayability, make this a truly awful game.Edit: I keep seeing people talk about how this game was made by one person so we should be nice, but the person who made it also bought the assets and the music. People MADE these assets, and MADE the music. He didn't do this alone."

And I'm glad I did. It's sort of encompassed things I'm going through at the moment, and how we shouldn't take things for granted because everything is finite. I can't say too much without spoiling the story and the philosophy it portrays, but without a doubt it's worth playing through. It's short, but gets the point across. The graphics are beautiful and it's deeper than most games I've played. I wouldn't necessarily call this a game, more of a philosophical and emotional journey expressed in the form of a game. All in all I'd like to thank the developer for making something this unique and human. I reccomend this game to anyone, it may come across as niche but if this game doesn't pull some heart strings I'd be very surprised. 10/10. Stunning experience."

There were many moments where my jaw was completely on the floor. Definitely a very good purchase.That being said, the ""gameplay"" is not what you might expect. It follows a mostly a linear path, and it is not really any sort of challenge. If gameplay is your focus, The First Tree is not for you. The focus here is art and story, where it absolutely shines."

I just finished the game, and although I recommend this game, it does have some flaws that would stop me from playing this game again. The world is really empty, and aside from finding those stars which are scattered across these empty maps, there isn't much to do to occupy your time. The fox travels extremely slowly, and I found myself going on my phone while holding W to pass the time, as getting anywhere took forever. There is also a level where you have to find these 3 rocks, and I found all 3, but the ""interact"" button didn't do anything on the first rock, except for show me this diagram of a fox with 0/3 underneath, which made me think I had to find 3 objects. I spent the next half hour scouring the map for...something, only to find that I had to spam the ""interact"" button to get the rocks to register that I had found them. This level was incredibly frustrating, as the rocks were scattered across the map, and the travel time was just incredibly long and boring. If the levels were filled with wildlife, maybe it would've been more interesting, but I'm sure even that would have gotten boring after a while. I would rather have had smaller levels with more content than large open levels with nothing to do. I wish the music would play more often, because spending so much time walking around doing nothing got pretty dull, and the music, which was fantastic, might've made it more interesting."

There is a lot of incredible stuff here, particularly for a one man team.  (As an aside, if it's a one man team, is it really a team, at that point?)I haven't beaten the game yet, as it's kind of late right now and I just don't have enough time, but what I've played so far is very good.  I enjoy the voice-over work, and the story seems compelling.  I know it's setting me up for something sad, but that's just more reason to keep at it.  The game is beautiful, as is the music.  Some of the sound design could use a little work, not because it's bad, but because there's too little variation.  For example, there's quite a lot of running in this game, but very few distinct sounds to denote running, which means that for the majority of the game you'll be hearing the exact same sound over and over.  To an extent, some of the textures and designs used are similar.  In the first area, there's quite a lot of...grass?  Weeds?  I'm not sure, but some sort of smaller plant.  The only issue is that for as many of them as I saw, they only came in two varieties, brown and darker brown, or perhaps that's a very dark green.In terms of gameplay, it's incredibly simplistic, but that's not a shortcoming in this case, as it adds to the game's charm.  The only complaint I have on that front is that certain things aren't very intuitive, or are flat-out strange.  For example, it seems as though if you run straight and then strafe to run at a diagonal angle, it seems to adopt the old Goldeneye approach, which increases your speed somewhat dramatically, because instead of running at normal speed at an angle, it seems to multiply your speed while two directions are being pressed.  And while that's just fine, it leads to some odd situations.These things are fairly minor, however.  Especially when  considering the fact that a single person made this entire thing, and did an incredible job on it.  I'm looking forward to playing it more, but I hear it's sort of short, and I don't want to blow through it all in one go.One last thing, though.  I spent an inordinate amount of time chasing rabbits.  I don't know what that says about me, but I never did manage to catch one."

Sadly, I couldn't bring myself to like it.First things first. In The First Tree, you play as a fox, exploring various landscapes and slowly unraveling the game's backstory. The key word is ""slowly"".The maps are very large, and scaterred throughout them are collectible stars and interactive spots which trigger the narration. Sadly, that's pretty much it. You spend 90% of the time in game running in a straight line, only to hear one or two lines of dialogue.Dear Esther is one of my favorite games. In it, you walk through an island - you can't even run, IIRC - triggering narration, like in The First Tree. The difference is, in Dear Esther the story, the island, the music - all of them are mysterious, captivating, highly atmospheric and make you want to discover it all. In The First Tree, you just wish you had a speedhack. After half an hour, I couldn't stand holding ""W"" any longer.As for the good things: the art style is pleasant. The narration is pretty good. The price is low.If you're interested in the game, you should watch a YouTube playthrough of it. It just isn't interesting enough to justify buying it IMO, even for the low price."

It looked and felt like some of my dreams too. Much more elaborate of course. The narration tells a story in itself that surrounds you in every way possible. The music snaps you out of it at the perfect time as a sullen reminder of what you as a fox is trying to accomplish. If you are in a highly-emotional state, I would recommend holding off for the time being, unless that's your thing.Only suggestions for improvement is adding a sprint toggle key, and adding a little better depth perception somehow. Jumping to grab stars can be a tad awkward.9.5/10 Did not get a permission slip for this huge feel tripTL;DR for the story:Call your father, not text, call him and tell him you love him!"

,Not Recommended,555150,34959159,Posted: 14 September,all,She Who Has Stars In Her Eyes,"My reccomendation for this game is completely unrelated to my own personal opinions. It is a very niche title which is difficult to outright recommend to anybody. This is a WALKING SIMULATOR, so please do not purchase it it expecting any form of gameplay as there is virtually none.I completed the game. Wasn't really what I thought. Came into it expecting Fox Simulator 2017. Instead what I played was more akin to Dear Ester (which I have also completed). Using Dear Ester as my only comparison as I have not played any other walking simulators, this is my critique:I can't but feel a little disappointed personally with the ''story'' behind it. This game follows the narrative between a man and a woman. The fox is only used as a means of advancing the story as opposed to being a focus of it. This could have had literally any other theme such as a player controlled toaster traversing a junkyard and still be inconsequential. There was no immersion factor or relationship between the human narrator and the fox outside of the narrator mentioning that the fox is simply a dream he is having (and another moment that I won't spoil). What is constantly talked about as you hit certain invisible checkpoints throughout the level is the narrator's real life problems. Personally, this does not interest me in any form.The level design was obviously made to stretch out the length of the game. Expect to be walking for a long time across minimally textured surfaces for minutes at a time with nothing going on. You cannot interact with any of the environment outside of collecting glowing point orbs which do nothing other than award steam achievements for collecting them, and one particular level's extremely basic mechanics to unlock a door. The few rabbits that I actually found run away from you as you draw close and cannot be interacted with. The entire time you will be moving between glowing white point markers in the distance which, for the most part, naturally lead you towards the end of each level.The music was extremely loud. Not my personal taste but I can't exactly rate it since it is entirely subjective, but the lack of basic options settings in the menu meant that I had to lower my headset volume since in game sounds cannot be adjusted. That includes the voice of the narrator. The music also does not loop, so as you are slowing making your way across expanses of nothingness expect to hear nothing but the crunching of leaves and rain. The options menu also lacked the ability to adjust the mouse sensitivity. By default it is extremely low. Apart from AA you cannot alter any of the graphics options outside of ''low, medium, ultra high, etc'' presets which I have no idea what the technical differences are between them. I played on ''very high'' but I don't imagine that, in a game as graphically simple as this, will have much of a performance impact. ''ultra high'' did tank my framemrate below 60 though, but without being able to see what each preset altered, I could not determine why that was.In conclusion I feel as though this game is almost strictly worse than Dear Ester. Good first attempt for the small development team behind it though. But if you were going to have to choose between either it would have to be Dear Ester. This game is graphically inferior with a rather questionble story and artifical pacing. Unfortunate since the ''Walking Simulator'' market is very niche and there are other popular, more established titles that have been out for years already. If you came here because you like foxes like me then you might not find this game to be as fulfilling in the fox aspect as you wish.As I said at the beginning, my choice to not recommend this game is independent of my own personal opinion of it. Unfortunately though, if I were recommend this game BASED ON my opinion then it would also have to be a ''no''. Dear Ester just does it better I'm afraid."

The graphics from the trailer are quite enticing, but the reality is much less impressive. The game is a walking sim with some very basic platforming with long dialogues overlayed on top of it. I'm sure the dual story aspect of the game converges at some point, but neither the gameplay or visuals hold up for long enough to make me want to see it.The trailer is VERY cherrypicked in terms of visual fidelity. The rest of the game is reminiscent of a 2005 era MMO world full of invisible walls and very barren landscapes. The platforming ""puzzles"" are simply not worth the time considering how much distance is placed between some of the elements. There is also some lack of polish in the form of no animation for picking up the ""coins"" in this game or typos in the subtitles.While the game is inexpensive at ~$7, I returned it as the presentation of the trailer was too out of line with what you actually get in the game."

Whatever you find on your way is a synchronicity for the story you hear in the background, and the voice acting is more than good. The art style and landscapes are mesmerizingly beautiful, esp. the use of colours and light, and the soundtrack is so touching, I could throw myself out of the window with a heartwarming smile on my face. Seriously, it´s an amazing soundtrack and I needed a tissue now and then. The story grabs you emotionally, showing what´s really important in life - family (that is my personal view). The sensitive and bitter sweet way the story is told goes deeply under your skin and takes you on a journey full of nostalgia to the source of the circle of life and death.Pros:- beautiful art style- immersive atmosphere- deep story- excellent voice acting- epic soundtrackCons:- short- a little buggy now and then- sometimes inaccurate controls- leaves you without any advice what to doI highly recommend this pearl of a game!It´s not perfect, but a beautiful parable about life."

I did find the fox a little difficult to control at times, especially with the camera moving slowly. Some additional settings such as adding a slider to make the camera move as fast as you want would certainly help, but once you get used to it it's not a game-breaking problem.The music was amazing as well.

IF there were 2 power-ups at the the base of the cliff, not only would that save time but at least hint towards using both.2) The last level requires you to enter a tent in a backyard, which: is big. I spent about half an hour wandering figuring out what I'm supposed to do, there was a subtle light beam hinting towards it: but not of enough interest to discover that's the goal, and instead cover every inch of that map. Going to youtube: another dude also wandering lost for 15 minutes, personally i'd recommend a light beam get gradually brighter over time, until 10 hours later there are a few dozen spotlights and arrows pointing at it.Of course, those 2 things now seem obvious now, and most people will probably pick it up much faster than I did, but for *some* noobs like me it kind of turned a ""sweet walking sim"" into a ""what on earth am I supposed to do"" puzzle game.I give it a 7.825 / 10"

,Recommended,555150,35012600,Posted: 16 September,all,204863 - gildedlink,"This short walksim is worth it during a sale or something else cutting its price.  It has a lot of nagging issues that I wish would have gotten more polish because they pull down an otherwise solid story with muddy controls and little to no animation.I can see the reason that other reviews are bringing up the empty feeling of the levels, but that doesn't bother me as much as the slow running speed of your character, and the messy way that they turn without any lean in or lean out animations, or sense of general direction through visual queues.  The animation is the biggest issue for me because there are times when the game can't decide whether it's a platformer or a walk sim, and a few of the collectible bits you can pick up involve frustrating jumps that are difficult or (in one case) impossible to reposition yourself to repeat.  The mechanic for jumping just feels inaccurate- rocks you can jump off don't easily signal where you've gone too far for a jump while running on them, and the lack of any significant animation queues with respect to direction or jump just makes the timing more frustrating than authentically challenging.  At least one jump that I failed (in a necessary part of the level) left me in a crevasse without any way of getting out, forcing me to restart a level.  Given the game is so short I can't escape the nagging feeling that some of those difficult jumps may be there just to push players out of the 2 hour refund period..In spite of these issues, if you do the bare minimum for story, I don't think it's that bad at all.  The color choice and environments are rather pleasant, the story itself is pretty good (though delivered through some awkward voice acting that might've benefitted from just one more dialogue pass- I have never heard the phrase 'my love' used seriously in a real life conversation, could just be me, and maybe some more attention to intonation making it sound more like a real conversation).  The ending is very satisfying as well.  The issues that plague this game are rather serious, but on balance with the amount of time you'll actually spend dealing with them, I think in general it's a game worth picking up and playing opportunistically the next time you see it on sale- the launch price may be a little high for the time you'll expend and the small annoyances you'll deal with otherwise."

It's Pretentious Walking Simulator Review time!This ticks most of the boxes to qualify as a Pretentious Walking Simulator: lots of walking, lots of voiceovers, plinky-slow piano music accompanied by strings, musings on the nature of life and death with a side-excursion into therapy for those doing the voiceovers, allegories involving nature! We have a full set! If this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, probably best to turn around now. For the rest...Visually, the game is well-presented and striking. Each level has a unique style that is lush in its own way. Similarly, the sounds and music are well done and seem to mesh well with the overall tone.I'm less enamored with the gameplay. There are some light platforming aspects that feel a bit clumsy. In particular, there's a part by a waterfall early on where it's clear you need to use butterflies to do a boost-jump over a wall. Even knowing that, I found this extremely difficult to pull off - it took me a good 20-30 minutes of trying. Perhaps there's a better way but if so, it was not obvious to me. I *nearly* stopped playing at this point. However, once this portion was done, the rest of the game offered very little in the way of platforming challenges, so it felt like an anomaly to me.Some of the levels are quite large, and somewhat aimless. You can be exploring them for quite some time and never find anything so it feels like a lot of exploration is just wasted time. On one level, I found 3 obsidian blocks, which I apparently unlocked. As far as I could tell, nothing happened when I got the 3rd one so not sure what that's about. A *little* more of a clue would have been helpful here. I don't need a game to hold my hand, but given the vastness of some of these levels, I wasn't really inspired to re-explore all of them on the off chance that something somewhere had changed.The story is a sort of therapy for a husband/wife team, with the fox tale as a sort of dreamscape background. The two tales seem very loosely connected, and I'm not really sure what the fox has to do with the voiceover story other than a general theme of loss.That leads me to another comment: the theme of loss is quite present in this, and as such the game has a heaviness that doesn't really let up. Without wanting to spoil things too much, suffice to say that it's hard to say this game has a ""happy"" ending (and I did get to the very-very-last fox bit by the lake and the house). It may help to mentally prepare yourself for the heaviness of the themes. It's no ""That Dragon, Cancer"" but neither is it sunshine and rainbows. On the plus side, unlike ""That Dragon, Cancer"", I didn't get walloped over the head with Bible themes, so that was nice.All told, worth a play if you're into this sort of thing. I was in the mood, so it worked for me. A solid 3 out of 5: recommended."

I still am; I think it's stunning, visually.That being said, I found the controls VERY difficult. Again, I'm not a serious gamer so some of it can be chalked up to inexperience, but I found the fluid camera very difficult to deal with; an option for a fixed camera, or being able to lock and unlock the camera with an in-game control would go along way. It's tough to judge distances and directions when the slightest touch sends you in circles. I've spent most of my time making 20+ runs at jumps with little success, and that's pretty frustrating. The game is (or should be) very zen and I think I would like it more if I could actually relax while playing it, rather than cursing a blue streak because I can only use the butterflies once to buff my jump before they fly back to where I picked them up.I really want to like this game, and I'll come back to it, but hopefully the controls will get an update and beome a bit more intuitive. A little more content would be nice too, in terms of things to explore in the environment (maybe a la WoW achievements). I still recommend it for what it is, though: a beautiful walking simulator. Maybe you'll have more luck than me, if you're an experienced gamer."

I totally recommend it!Though...I have encountered a few glitches and goofs throughout the game. For instance. I have gotten out of bounds in places that are probably not meant to be reached. Before I entered the location of The First Tree (The large house on the mountain with the logs.) I found I could jump up the mountain to get to it. Along with impossible heights. I also got to jump up the highest mountain, and see exactly where The First Tree was...It is an amazing game though. I spent my money at the right place ! 😄"

U playmostlyas a cute little fox that discovers its home and is searching for a special tree. It's really relaxing and gives u many oppertunitys to think about the story and your actions. It has a few ""bugs"" but thats the charm of an Indie one-man game :DIn the end its an awesome walking-simulator and really good to play if u have time to play it through in one go."
,Recommended,555150,35230607,Posted: 26 September,all,Mara,"I waited for over a year to play this game and it did not disappoint. A stunningly beautiful game with excellent voice acting (done by the developer and his wife, if I'm not mistaken!) and amazing soundtrack. The story is very touching and emotional, I'd say that a box of tissues would come in handy while playing it. A short game but it was worth the asking price if you ask me - even with some minor glitches what comes to the controls (mostly jumping related), the story and the powerful message of the game will be well worth it. I feel it has replay value too."
76561198122918583,Recommended,555150,35264949,Posted: 28 September,all,Wiggly Google,Highly reconmend this game. Short game with some narration spaced out enough to keep it interesting. Especially if you go looking for it. The player is a fox (3rd person view point).Pros:-Simple graphic yet still nice looking-nice story (metaphroical aspects)-puzzles take strenuos brain power-nice music (doesn't play all that often)-largeish level designCons:-platforming a little finiky (not too much of a hinderous)-music doesn't play that often so you're often left with the sound of you walking/running (I was usually distacted by how the scenary looked or the music)-the shadows could be improved-puzzles not hard to figure out. Just requires you to explore the area and a little brain power (not ment to be a hard puzzle game)Can be completed in about 1hr 30min depending on how much you want to go exploring

If you don't want it spoiled, all you need to know is that I 100% recommend this game.I've been following this game for over a year - snippits of Imgur posts about the game progress. It instantly captivated me, and I have been looking forward to its release ever since. While I was a couple weeks off, once I saw it was out, I pounced on it.And this game was 100% worth it.The game itself felt a little slow, but goodness, did it make up the minutes wandering around in the beauty and story. I absolutely loved playing through it.The game follows a mother fox who finds one of her dear children dead, and slowly introduces concepts (That are incredibly, beautifully made) that makes the game feel like it isn't just a story, but an adventure you go through as well. Not to mention the sentimental value and meaning it carries to everyone who was once a teenager with a little angst. An incredibly sad, yet valuable story, that I would recommend everyone to take a look at.It made me grateful for what I have, and realize how much I've taken for granted."

I enjoyed this game, if you take a wrong turn it can lead to quite a lot of plodding around to try get back on track, the running speed of the fox is a little menotonous and could be improved as could the clues as to where to go for the ""discoveries"" but the story is worth it in the end, very emotional though, not for the sensitive!Imagery: 10/10Music: 10/10Story: 8/10Voice acting: 8/10"
,Recommended,555150,35357634,Posted: 30 September,all,Neo's_Neo,"Gameplay Aestheic wise is awesome. It looks beautiful and sounds good.The level design is very bad, however, and there is much back tracking and this really ruins the game. It is also very bad at directing the player to the next objective, you just kind of wander most of the time. The puzzle for the stars is mostly pointless and even the end game messages are pointless. Id recommend this game only if you want to find a good art example of a game."
,Recommended,555150,35318724,Posted: 29 September,all,Jakkz,"This is totally worth the time and money.This game has the kind of adventure that I am always looking for. One that has a very strong background and lots of little details. Besides the beautiful scenic atmosphere, this game is an amazing emotional train that will bring you to the one place we all visit in our lifetimes. The First Tree.Pros: Good story, Fancy graphics, Great detail, Massive world to explore, Heartwarming storyline.Cons: Can get lost easily, The lighting in the game can tend to get really dark, Very feelsy, Story can jump depending on the player's effort to explore, Graphics quality can be a little overwhelming for an older system which (in my opinion) can take away from the experience of the beautiful ultra settings.9/10 Would play again, and again, and again, you get it. (10/10 being my all time favorite, don't take this seriously David >.>)"

,Recommended,555150,35323237,Posted: 29 September,all,Nieodemus Erenbor,"I like this implementation of story telling.It is engrossing and wonderful, and with the beautiul graphic this is what modern novels look like.If you're expecting a cute story of a mother fox and her 3 cubs and not other thing, you might as well kill that expectation before starting though, becausethis is actually a sad story of a man, who struggled to cope with his lost. The fox that we play is in his dream, and the story on the fox side is not any happier.The game itself is not too long (I took 4 hrs to complete the story with a lot of getting lost and exploration.) There's a good depth and relatibility to the story for the legth, as well as something you could think about as the game end.There's only few things that are a bit frustrating for me:Frustrating jumps. I don't know if it's just me but jumps in this game are really hard. There's lots of time that the game seems to not recognize me pressing the spacebar when I was also pressing the directional keys. But even without those I still find jumping frustrating in general.I know this is exploration game, but comparing to the size of map and how far apart each significant spot are placed, character speed is a bit too slow. Could feel like the game is snail-pacing at times.The graphic is nice in general, but I feel like the dev get lazy with some part of the map. There's trees and cliffs and grasses and shrubs placing together nicely in one part and another part is just solid dirt with obsolutely no details or other decoration.I didn't fully get a grasp of how I should interpret the story. So I'd be happy if anyone is willing to share their interpretation!"

I like when a game has this kind of drama to it.The only negatives I could think of is that it would've been better if the game had more music in the background due to it's a game where you walk basically all the time and music is needed for the feeling.Also I would've liked for it to be longer than just a few hours.But I do recommend this game, I very much enjoyed it."
