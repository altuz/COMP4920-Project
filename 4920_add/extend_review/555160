,Recommended,555160,34700324,Posted: 2 September,all,byteframe,"THIS. Finally, this. We have this. I doesn't seem like Valve is working on CS:GO:VR but this is very close to the real thing. This is high quality VR deathmatchwith players! Also bomb defusal mode like Counter-Strike. Rendering is crisp and performant, and everything sounds nice and realistic. The weapons are great, and the gun-play is outrageously fun with perfect VR integration. You will get good at this game, and feel so blood thirsty in the best VR murder simulator there is! Also, you can teamkill in this game! Thank you very much! Team killing is very important to me.I love climbing to the top of the Rust map and shooting down from above. In Datacenter, I try to akimbo with a shotgun and a pistol. I can't reload the shotgun unless I holster the pistol so it's kind of hard, but it's really fun and gangster to start with a single blast of buckshot and then spam some scrow with a glock -- if I can surprise him and he's not with a friend. When not screwing around, I guess I prefer the AK to the M4, just because it you have to manually load a chamber into the round which is more fun than just the touchpad action on the M4. You get infiniite magazines so you don't have to worry about this if you can remember to keep a round chambered from last time. I think they should only give you finite magazines, and let you scavenge, or more likely, die before expending them all -- but with less spam made by all.You might be out of luck if you don't handle touchpad movement well.Take Dramamine(r), I guess.It has teleportation option, but you will get housed in deathmatch, and/or will have to be a bit more of a prone camper rather than running around. The hit detection might screw you if you are too close to your enemy, I hope they improve it. The lobby room is still weird, and you don't see (you only) hear the other players when you queuing up. The stock maps are few but now fully furnished. Luckily everybody is rushing to make their best Dust2 or CoD badly-scaled map facsimile because this game has workshop support - woooo! This is the best way to spend $9.99 if you have a VR headset.Back when there was a demo, it had full hand/arm models. It looked fairly decent, but they wisely removed them. Also, there was a kid trying to get oriented, on my team, and he was squawking up a storm. I executed the child by teamkill. I'm sorry, I know that's really bad etiquette what with the personal nature of VR and all that, so I will never do that again.

,Recommended,555160,30228889,Posted: 27 February,all,christianled59,"9.5/10Now I bet you're asking: ""How does this compare to Onward?""That's the wrong question. That would be like comparing Arma to Battlefield. Both are great games, but for different reasons.Pavlov is tactical first person shooter game for VR. Much like Onward, the gunplay is very realistic (aside from damage). In fact, I'd say the guns handle BETTER than they do in Onward. However, gameplay is much more like CS:GO.Pros:-The guns handle so well. The recoil feels legitimate and accurate. (take my word for it, I shoot a lot in real life, they compare pretty well aside from the weight and 'actual' recoil from the real deal).-The graphics are clear and sharp. The game runs incredibly well (aside from a small glitch that'll desribe more in detail later on). The menus are clean and intuitive and everything feels rather polished.-Communication is excellent. The radio works very nicely (again, I honestly prefer this radio than the one in Onward). There is also vacinity communication.-Fun gamemodes. Team deathmatch is fast paced, fun and still tactical, while Search in Destroy is just as tactical as CS:GO, but with the realism and immersion of Onward. It's fast, rewarding, and you never get bored.-Price. I was not expecting that price. This game couldeasilysell for $15USD and I'd still enjoy every penny. This is definitely the best valued shooter on the market.Cons:-There isn't enough time at the start of a match to really plan things out. I'd like it if there was a 10-15 second timer at the start of Search and Destroy rounds.-The buy menu should be a little bit more obvious. I've heard the same question, ""how do we buy"" about 100 times.-There's a bug that causes me to see my Vive home. It seems completely random and I can only fix it by bringing up the menu again. When it happens, I'm completely blind for a few moments. It really draws me out of the experience.Suggestions:-A map of some sort. Perhaps something we can bring up, or even a hud on our wrists.-More maps. Some that area  bit more open and some that are close quarters. I'd like to really take advantage of that sniper. ;)-More guns.I'm sure alot of these suggestions are already in the works. I'll add to this review if I come up with anything else.Conclusion:This is one of my favorite Vive games. No, it's not a replacement for Onward, nor is it really a major competetor. It's a different game all together. If you want slow, tactical gameplay, then play Onward. However, if you need your quick fix, then jump on here and play TDM. Better yet, if you want fast paced, tactical, and always in the action gameplay, try out the Search and Destroy mode.The devs are active and great, and this game has some true potential. For that price, there's no reason you should hesitate to pick up this amazing game."

We turn around the next corner and BAM !We run right into the enemy and everyone goes frantic with shooting until my friend and 1 of the enemies gets shot by the insane amount of bullets spraying everywhere. The shooting stops and i find myself in a good ol' mexican standoff with the last remaining enemy. We both have our AR's aiming right at eachother's heads. I can hear his breathing slowly increase as the tensions rise, i aim down my sights to get the perfect shot. He does the same, the bomb in the background which had been planted earlier is beeping faster and faster. My heart is beating quicker then ever and in a split of a second we both scream and fire. CLICK. Both of our guns are out of ammunition and we stare at eachother for a second realizing what had just happened. Then immedently pull out our knives and lunge at eachother, i fall and trip on the floor unhurt and he misses and turns around. Knife in hand, my attacker lunges onto me. I close my eyes knowing that this is the end.I hear a bloodcurdling scream and a brutal stab sound, Suddenly i realize that i didn't die ! I open my eyes to find that i had killed him as he lunged down on me to finish the job. I lie back down and sigh with absolute relief and joy just in time to be burnt to a crisp by the planted bomb."

Like in CSGO you can buy weapons before the match starts that might give you an advantage. But it is not unfair since you can ""easily"" kill someone with the regular pistol or a knife.I was playing some 1 vs 1 which was very intense and got me heavily immersed.Fantatstic game!++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++What a surpise! Such a great VR FPS.This game has everything I am still waiting for Onward, which makes it now top of the list of the VR FPS out there and why I think every VR gamer should have this one in his library.Briefly what I like:- Onward locomotion and works perfect- team deathmatch with quick respawn 4 vs 4- there is a also a capture flag - but did not play it yet- small map- Single player with bots (!)- chaning weapons on respawn: at the moment pistol, SMGs, ARs and a Sniper Rifle- Grenades- easy load system with both hands though- friendly fire on, but team mates have name icon over their head, enemies do not have this icon- performance perfect, no stutter, nothing- great netcode- already a lot people play it- respawn - points to achieve - just like in Cod - no waiting- shooting windows breaks them and it looks cool in VR- intelligent map design- fair price tag- good blood effect that you actually see you hit an enemy- gun n run- no waiting between the rounds like in Onward - I hated the waited, especially if you have a headset on and you are standing this is annoyingWhere I see room for improvements:- more levels- more details in the levels- not to have to click the grip button to get my second / left hand from holding the barrel of the gun- more guns- more game modes- more tactical gameplay- some sort of team channel for voice- more stability - had a crash after a matchAbsolutely recommended!!!"

76561198127814394,Recommended,555160,34513736,Posted: 26 August,all,Zach Monty,"This is coming from someone who has played both Pavlov and Onward.Pavlov is A FPS that is modelled heavily off of counterstrike. Now if you arent a fan of counterstrike dont let this dicourage you, as you can actually ADS and not everyone is one tapping your head with an AK. The real charm of the game is the slight arcade style of the deathmatch gamemode is a new and refreshing experience for sure. Granted there arent a lot of guns, but they all are unique in their own play style. Each gun has its own recoil modifier and firerate which can actually make one gun preferable over another. An addition upside is how easy it is to reload. the grabbing mechanics for the cocking lever and magazines are very easy and arent glitchy. In addition to the, just messing around in offline mode is an excellent way to practice with all the guns.Onward is more of a military sim. It takes 1-2 shots to kill at the chest, and all the guns can be customized. in addition, there are more weapons to use and a more detailed loadout screen. Onward also has more realistic environments. When playing Pavlov I felt like I was still playing a video game because of the map design and texture quality, whereas Onward has realistic enviroments and more realistic sounds.Overall, due to the weapon handling, damage system, and just basic game design, pavlov is my recommended choice."

,Recommended,555160,32739398,Posted: 24 June,all,Falandorn,"This is a copy of the review posted on reddit a week or so ago:I wanted to give a brief account of how I found this game as I am really in to shooting games and Onward raised the bar pretty high. I was lucky enough to be invited on the pre-alpha of Onward by Dante at the start and then spent quite a lot of time with his assembled testers. During this period a few shooting games popped up but I ignored them for the most due to Onward ticking all the right boxes for me.I posted a few days ago how I hoped to see 32/64 player large scale skirmishes in VR one day and speculated when that might be. I looked at Vorpx for BF1 and decided at present due to the 3D not being present it was just not worth the hassle, iv been down that road many times with hacked in VR support.I heard about Pavlov pretty much from the start but was instantly turned off by it, I didn't like the negative spin it placed on Onward it seemed more a game for disgruntled ex-Onward players who just couldn't handle getting shot and sitting out for several minutes each round. It sounded softer and more floaty than Onward and that just didn't appeal to me.Now I sound like I might be more in to Rainbow 6 than CoD or BF4 but that's just not true, I loved the stealthy elements of games like Goldeneye where you could sneak around taking out guards but also really loved just pelting about at full speed getting killing sprees. I really want to be a snob and choose the classy Flashpoint games but really I'm just a chav who loves guns =DNow Onward filled that VR shooter role perfectly, and still does to an extent I guess now I am just keen for that softer CoD/BF role to get filled. Onward does require a certain amount of head-game to play well or you just get wasted fast and spend a lot of time sitting about waiting. That can be frustrating so I finally picked up Pavlov to see if it held up to some of the hype.Oh boy what a fantastic game experience this was! I picked it up yesterday - I'm just gonna pop down and check hours-played...7 hours played! haha that was more than I thought, 7 hours pretty much in two sittings. I just could not stop it was a lot of fun.The community seems quite small as you would expect in the day but activity picked up in the evening. It did not seem to matter which zone you selected, US, EU or Asia there were around 40 people online at one time at around 8pm GMT.The gameplay felt very solid, the controls were like Onward and thankfully not teleport (sorry guys I just loath teleport in anything other than The Gallery type games). The interface was well thought out and although it took an embarrassingly long time to get out of the first room (including forum searches) I was soon in a battle.Gun mechanics are pretty similar to Onward, the rifles and pistols have a drift which makes them feel floaty and disconnected at times, I really do not like this feature. It spoils immersion, I know why they did it but I don't like it. For recoil just make the gun animation jump faster each single bullet and kick instantly up and back to position rather than wonder off on its own detaching itself from its real-life controller position.Recoil happens so fast it would be hard to notice, I know it is not ideal and in real life muzzle climb is present but for the sake of the game I just think displaying an instant kicking gun animation and re-centering would be adequate for when the trigger is held down, the random shot pattern will just reflect how erratic the gun is kicking. This point will probably need going over in comments.The bullets felt slower too, this might have been down to the tracer animation or the wall hit decals, when I fired a shot it seemed to take time for the bullet to arrive. Whilst that is true in real life over large distances at ranges less than 100m or so the hit should be almost instantaneous, I might just be confused here though it could be lag I would like a dev to confirm it I will take it up with them later. If there is travel time though I don't like that idea at all.The health of the player is quite high on body shots, I haven't had chance to check yet damage scales but it seems at times you can take several shots to kill someone 4-5 to the body at least. It depends on if the target is wearing armor that you can buy in-game. Headshots are instant kills but I think with head armor it is one shot to take the hat off and a second to kill. I don't know if some weapons still one-shot kill to the head though regardless of helmet. I know the bolt action pretty much one-shot kills anything no matter what body part you hit.Holding down the trigger quickly makes automatic gunfire go all over the place, which is bad news for me who never got comfortable tap-firing. I am getting better but generally the first 2-3 shots are the best so it is taking some getting used to.Despite the CS feel to this game I felt once you get your bearings it translates perfectly to VR, I was able to become competitive very quickly as regardless of your location so long as you follow the basics eg, find hard cover, move quietly unless needed, minimise time in exposed areas, maintain situational awareness head on a pivot, aim for the chest and head etc then it doesn't matter where you are you are dangerous to the enemy.It was comforting to see I was not terrible at this CS clone, unlike the original CS where I seem to get insta-killed every corner. I can't translate real life skills in to a mouse and keyboard but stick a gun in my hand and I feel very happy and at home :O)So overall impressions are outstanding, this is 5 v 5 with the option of BOTs to play against to fill the numbers. The BOTs have different difficulty settings but this will probably just frustrate me with their wallhacking lol It is good for stress against the easy ones I guess.I would highly recommend anyone to pick this up, it was £7 or something like that, a ridiculously small fee for what is an insanely good game. I still love Onward but I will definitely be playing a lot more Pavlov and hope they can push out more and more players in to the maps! Go and buy this game straight away what are you waiting for!!!TLDR - Incredible VR FPS shooter, this is a fantastic CS clone made for VR, epic charging about TDM madness with some objective based play too!"

Depending on the time there between 10-50 players online which is fine as the lobbys are limited to 8 players.I hope there will be a lot more content in the future. Custom map support would be the best that could happen to this game if you'd ask me because the amount of maps is the only big negative point I have and the game is only developed by one guy (respect for that!) and it will probaly take a long time to get new maps if he's working on it alone.There are a lot of things planned for the future like a COOP zombie mode and more.

,Recommended,555160,30477551,Posted: 12 March,all,stone cold killa,"So I'm new to the game, and was enjoying my first game of search and destroy. The tutorial didn't offer much information except for how to equip and unequip weapons. I was mostly dying, but enjoying it nonetheless. One round we managed to kill off all the enemies, and when the loud banging noises of the rifles stopped, a beeping sound reached our ears. We knew what had to be done. We looked around, searching for the bomb and found it in the server room. Now, this is where the tutorial could've helped, if it would offer information ofhow to defuse a bomb.The bomb started beeping faster, obviously indicating that we need to hurry the ♥♥♥♥ up. However, none of us knew how to defuse a bomb. This is where I found myself in a pinch. ""How hard can it be? It's VR, but you probably just have to touch the bomb or something."", I thought. Oh how naive. I started screaming: ""IT DOESN'T WORK! HOW DO YOU DEFUSE THE FREAKING BOMB!?"". None of my teammates knew how to defuse it either, leaving us in a clutch situation. I started shooting the bomb. Didn't work. I tried to knife the bomb. Didn't work. I barely stopped myself from throwing a grenade at the bomb, which would've killed us all.The beeping was now very fast, as in it-will-explode-any-second fast. I started losing my cool again, screaming. Actually, I never regained my cool, and kind of screamed throughout the whole thing. I said: ""IT'S TOO LATE NOW! ABORT MISSION, ABORT! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES, SAVE YOURSELVES! RUUUUUN!!!"" And ran like a cheetah across the map. The bomb exploded, we lost yet another round,but we made it out of the server room, alive.That's what I think makes these VR multiplayer games so enjoyable. The gameplay is obviously a big part, but it's the interaction between players and level of immersion that makes me come back to them."

,Recommended,555160,33550284,Posted: 14 July,all,Baphomet,"If you’ve ever wanted to see what it would be like to play counter-strike in a VR environment, Pavlov is the game for you. Aiming weapons is fairly realistic (hold them with two hands or you’ll have a bad time) and you have to drop and reload magazines and pull back the slide or bolt like you would with a real life gun. Throwing grenades also feels very intuitive and planting a bomb in search and destroy requires you to physically (virtually?) key in a sequence as illustrated on the explosive’s digital interface.Of course, for a game aspiring to be counterstrike: VR addition, Pavlov can be surprisingly lacking. The current weapon selection is a bit limited, tutorials sparse, and feedback ambiguous (did I do 0 damage? 20? 100?). The game feels like it’s almost what it should be but still needs a bit more spit and polish to get there.All in all though, this game is a great pickup despite its flaws. You’re bound to get a good 10 hours before you start to get tired of things, which is an absolutely unheard-of level of replayability compared to other popular VR titles. In fact, just thinking about Pavlov while writing this review is giving me a Pavlovian response to pick it back up again."
,Not Recommended,555160,32013922,Posted: 28 May,all,dogtato,"Every comment I get on this review makes me dislike it more. Pavlov tribe members think the only reason someone could dislike this game is lack of skill, or euphemestically ""lack of practice"". I appreciate the initial offers to help me learn the game, that's good community. But if you keep insisting I would like it if I just learned to play, while ignoring my actual complaints, then you're just being obnoxious.I tried Onward and it was NOT my pace of game, so when I tried this I really liked the pace of the deathmatch mode and the feel of the weapons. After a while, I got frustrated with the loading screen bug and tried BAM, which is another notch up in terms of deathmatch intensity. Now Pavlov's deathmatch feels too slow and there are too few weapons and game modes. It has the bomb mode, but I'm not really a fan of game modes where you can't jump right back in after you die.The loading screen bug was fixed eventually, but by then I had moved on. One of the main things I still dislike is how hits are shown visually, with a decal that appears on walls behind people when you shoot them. It makes sense in a way, but I'm not a fan because it doesn't work if they aren't standing next to a wall. If I trusted the networking code to register hits directly, I would like it a little more. But ultimately I just want to reliably see when I hit someone, like PUBG blood spray effect.If you are really in to the bomb defusal game mode, then get this, or maybe that new game Breach It, which I haven't tried but looks cool. If you can handle trackpad locomotion, but only if it's not too fast, this might also be a good choice. There are caveats that might make this a good choice, but if you want a variety of gunfights and can handle moving at jogging speeed vs walking, spend an extra $5 and get Bullets and More. More guns, maps, player per game, everything really. Except bomb defusal, but like I said that's not really my cup of tea.list of some things I dislike: slow movement speed, how blurry it is (maybe AA on be default? didn't check settings), how bad the new maps are (still early workshop stuff, to be fair) , the lack of feedback that makes the hit detection even more suspect, the lack of guns, AND every time I exit it sort of crashes and won't let me open a better game until I jump through some hoops of killing/restarting stuff."

,Not Recommended,555160,33664715,Posted: 19 July,all,NicLovin,"Having played Pavlov, BAM, and Onward, I can honestly say each is worth getting in time, each focus on different tempos and have different feels, which ill list below. Instead of a full review of the game (plenty of others have given better ones anyway) I will focus on giving a comparison instead. I'm sure this review will marked as not helpful, but I'd be more interested in hearing from those that own and played all 3 instead of just Pavlov alone. While I wouldnt recommend this game, Pavlov is by no means a bad game, it just pales in comparison to the other two. Onward does the one-life search and destroy thing better, although in a more tactical setting, while BAM has it beat on the action side. Pavlov just sits awkwardly in the middle. Pavlov does things well enough, and in its own way, but much like overwatch and battleborn (two completely different games in their own rights) one pales compared to the other. I will say this though beforehand, Pavlov is an odd case, Id either get it first, before you've played the other games and enjoy it as it is, or get it last and play it with a grain of salt, its not as good as the other two, but maybe you just needed something slightly different.Onward: Feels like ARMA or Rainbow SixBy far the most polished, both in audio, visual, controls, gameplay and fluidity. This is a game you would ""graduate"" to once you are familiar with VR shooters and maybe even built a gunstock out of PVC pipe or bought one for your controllers. The community and player base is strongest in this game, customization options are fair and in an easy to use interface. Modes and Maps are good, but not expansive like BAM.BAM: Feels like Call of Duty (but the good ones!)Gameplay is great and feels fluid, with a pleathera of single player and multiplayer game modes. It has the most features with being able to climb, load akimbo pistols off the belt, pull grenade pins with your teeth, customize sights, the most amount of guns, maps and an impressive amount of game modes. It lacks in the audio and visual department, and the conrols could use a a very tiny bit of polish (particularly, it could be slightly more forgiving when trying to pick things up) to get it to Onward levels but these are forgivable given the actual quality of gameplay. BAM is the best value for the Price with the sheer amount of content it gives you.Pavlov: Plays like Counter Strike, when you can actually get a SnD game.The easiest to learn and pick up out of the three. It is fast paced, and straight forward. On the visual and audio front everything is good, but not great. Out of the three Pavlov needs the most work at a technical, content and feature level.  However its simplicity and rough edges also works for it in an odd sort of ugly duckling way. This is counter stike VR, as straight forward as it can get. The online player base rests between BAM and Onward, and the price tag being the lowest helps its case overall. There are 2 game modes, TDM which has you with a new weapon each time you die and SnD, most people online just play TDM however. The game has potential but its sparse on game modes, weapons and at the time of this review, has no weapon customication. The recoil seems to be random and the hitscan or netcode (whichever it is) seams off. The controls/ interactions were odd and lacks some of the VR movement finese, additionally, people mesing with their height settings so they can see and shoot over cover while their body is safe behind cover is currently a huge issue in games at the moment and full speed sprinting while prone is also a thing you can do this game, so yeah.Again I would say all three games are worth getting in time, much in the same way people would recommend battlefield, Call of duty, and Rainbow six. All of them are shooters with different things they bring to the game.As far as a recommended order goes I would say:-BAM first, just alone for its huge amount of content, and at only 5 bucks more than pavlov its a no brainer.-Onward second, its more expensive, but boy is it worth it. With the more hardcore nature its best to get used to VR shooters in one of the other games first.-Pavlov last, because (kind of) counterstrike VR!"

Move with the left touch pad.  Sprint if nothing is in your hands.  Pick up objects with the trigger, and place them on your belt or vest with the grip buttons.Getting the controler positioning right takes some practice and isn't perfect, but in the last few days there have been a ton of improvements and additions to the map.

That's a good thing because it allows this game to play very fast in VR.

Some of the things I'm still getting used to, like how to reload on each different type of gun.  I find the shotgun and bolt weapons especially troublesome with having to move and enemies nearby or behind cover.  It seems like maybe the touch controller is not optimized for this game as I don't get consistent performance.Lots of maps, it seems each round I was downloading a new map.

I would hate to see a AAA title to release down the road and see this game fall off due to having a small dev team that simply can't keep up.

It is easily the best online FPS for VR that I have played so far and could be the best VR game I've played. Easily worth the $6 (as of writing - 40% off regular price of $10).As of writing this, only one map is available. The game is similar to Counterstrike. The lone map is similar in setting to CS Office but not at all similar in terms of layout.The movement mechanics are very smooth. The game uses full analog movement via the non-dominant hand trackpad. It works quite well. In addition, you use roomscale to walk around and peek and poke about.The gun and equipment mechanics are fine; among the best I've used. And this is because they are lenient. I've found in other games that reloading can be finicky and rather stubborn in that you need to slide the magazine right into the slot rather accurately or it didn't work. Or you have difficulty cocking the firearm because it's too hard to grab the little handle to pull it back. Pavlov instead takes a far more lenient approach in that your fresh magazine only needs to be close to the slot and it snaps in, your hand only needs to be close to the pouch to grab a fresh magazine, and only close to the handle to slide the receiver back. While this is not realistic, it makes the game more fun because you're not getting frustrating while you drop magazines or only slide the bolt partially back in the heat of a firefight. As such, you're focusing less on reloading and more on trying to shoot your enemies and be aware of your surroundings.All in all, a very smooth launch. No lag that I noticed, easy to join games, most people were generally nice and helpful, the map is quite good, and the graphics are nice and smooth so it's somewhat easy to spot enemies; just like in the older CS games.This all said, there are A LOT of features missing that are basic to other online games:-No ability to kick/ban or really control too much about the servers-No indication you are being hit. No HUD display or bloody-screen or anything.-No indication you are hitting your enemy. Sometimes there are basic blood decals on the walls but not always.-Only a single map-There may be some hit detection issues but this could be a combination of latency, body armor being very effective, and no visual indication you are hitting your target. I'm not too sure. Sometimes I am unloading my gun on a target and am close enough to be confident I am hitting them and they don't die. I could be missing but it doesn't feel like it. Not enough to really detract from the game but hopefully indication of hitting and what not is added to the game at some point."

I'm not even a huge fan of first person shooters since 18 call of duty's came out but his game is simple, well-designed and hugely addictive.My only small gripes are it feels like the controls need some slight refinement. When trying to quickly holster a weapon and draw my knife, it feels very clumsy. Also, when I'm kneeling it is very difficult to reload, as the ammo pack disappears through the floor.It could also do with much more levels and modes but as this is early access, I can forgive all these minor issues.Great game. Keep the updates coming!"
,Recommended,555160,35238233,Posted: 27 September,all,Kako^,"(Playing on Rift) A really fantastic game. It gets called VR Counter-Stike a lot and that's probably a fair comparison. Search and Destroy mode has an economy where you buy weapons for money etc.Playing online is great fun, the community is amazing. I solo queue and most people are really friendly and communicate.Gameplay on the Rift is fine, despite not being listed as supported. All reloading is manual (you have to eject the mag and manually insert a new one) and it's so satisfying - no issues with tracking or funny button presses using the Rift.Workshop support is just incredible, maps from Counter-Srtike, Goldeneye, Legend of Zelda(!) etc are all played online fairly regularly.For the price, you absolutely cannot go wrong."
,Recommended,555160,32972278,Posted: 28 June,all,Exyborg,"This is a spectacular shooter for VR! It's got the option of online play, of course, but if there are no online rooms available or you need some practice offline play with bots is possible. The bots are a bit slow, so you feel a definite advantage against the enemy. However, don't expect your bot teammates to have your back. They'll likely shoot the enemy walking behind you after the enemy has killed you. The best aspect about this title is Steam Workshop compatibility. Developers are welcome to design maps and share them with the Steam community for online or offline play. I've played several other shooter-type games and only one other military-type game, but Pavlov is better than I ever could've even asked for. A definite recommendation to anyone who owns a VR rig."

Very high replayability, nice fan made maps...I would only add a good tutorial as the controls are a bit clumsy and take time to figure it out.Also, when using that 'teleport-esque' type of movement it's not possible to go through some of the half open doors- players moving backwards and jumps back.But these are minor bugs to be resolved.

,Recommended,555160,34373882,Posted: 20 August,all,Songbearer,"Currently, this is the closest thing you'll get to a VR Counterstrike or Call of Duty. Less deliberate in pace compared to its rival Onwards, Pavlov is a great shooter with a fairly minimal learning curve. The multiplayer scene is generally active, oftentimes providing you with several servers to choose from no matter what time of day it is, and the shooting controls are very intuitive and feel great.There's no arcade style automatic reloading, you have to track your shots fired and physically reload your weapons whenever the opportunity arises. Death doesn't come immediately - you can generally take a beating before you go down, but the time to kill never feels too slow. Once you get a hang of the way the guns handle, you'll start to feel like a badass in no time. The community is friendly and fun for the most part, I've not come across anybody who'd I'd describe as toxic.Workshop support means that there are tons of user-made maps which have so far all felt a lot of fun to play on, and if you don't have the map the game will automatically download it for you when you join a server running one. In terms of single player, the bots are passable but seem a little too passive for their own good. Regardless, the shooting feels slick enough that the sheer act of running around blasting bots is a good way to pass the time while waiting for a server to open up.All in all, if you're looking for something a little more casual but with enough mechanical depth to practise and master, you can't go wrong with Pavlov. It's currently one of the leading examples in how to do PVP multiplayer shooters correctly in VR."

But once you get to know the entire weapon arsenal it's just simply amasing to see how you progress in aiming, shooting, killing.It reminds me of playing counterstrike, however, instead of having the feeling of sucking like in onward, I really get the feeling of improving every time I go in to play. Last night I was playing with a couple of navy seals and I got destroyed because of their reaction and aiming times, however I didnt get frustrated at all, I was simply amased with how good you can get playing this game.It goes without saying, €10 is a steal for this game, it is the best shooter (and actually the best game I every played on the vive) ever. This will also be my go-to game for testcasing the vive for people that play it for the first time.The offline mode with bots is a great way to learn, the multiplayer mode is simply challenging, fun, great.And the best thing of it all is, it's super polished and smooth. Playing on my 970m goes without a single hickup in the best settings, so dont hesitate to buy this game even if you are playing on a subpar graphics card.The only thing this game needs now is a sort of dust2 map, one that would really place this game on the top shelf and make the vive become a real e-sport attribute. This is actually the first game that, in my opinion, would easily fit the e-sport league, without a doubt. If Virtus.pro, Fnatic or any other esport team makes the jump to go VR, it would be this game. If -I keep underlining this- this game gets some great, great maps.

,Recommended,555160,34756056,Posted: 5 September,all,MrMaffen,"I really like this game and recommend buying it, although there's still room for improvement, as is expected for an Early Access game. It's basically CS:GO in VR and after a few hours of playing I can say that I had a ton of fun and give this game an 8/10.Pros:- The game runs very well on my PC (GTX 970, i5 4670k, 16gb RAM)- Gameplay overall feels very good. Gun handling and reloading takes some practice, but after a while you can get really good at it. I feel like I improved my aim and reload speed by a whole lot since my first round.- Maps and game modes are fun. Currently there's Search&Destroy (think defuse in CS:GO) and Team Deathmatch. New maps can be easily downloaded ingame from the workshop, which makes the play sessions feel fresh and exciting. In addition there's remakes of popular CS maps like de_dust2, de_aztec and cs_office etc. Playing these maps in VR and actually feeling like you are there is a real mind-blow.Cons:- Spawn mechanics in Team Deathmatch are awful. It feels like the game doesn't do any checks for nearby players. This means that you'll sometimes spawn 2m next to an enemy and either get lucky and get a free kill or get killed before you can pull your gun. This aspect had me frustrated a couple of times. Maybe spawn protection would also be a good idea? This even happened when playing 1v1 with a friend, so there were more than enough available safe spawn points on the map. davevillz please fix ...- Body shots only do minor damage while headshots kill instantly (without helmet). This needs some balancing in my opinion. Maybe some sort of optional hardcore mode could be nice. I feel like this game could be a direct competitor for Onward, if a hardcore mode would be added. More realistic damage models would certainly get my adrenaline pumping in this game.- Map loading bug: Once every other hour the game refuses to load the selected map and instead loads the default one, which is Datacenter. This can be quite annoying since a lot of people will leave the server, because they don't want to play Datacenter yet again ...- Occasional menu bugs: Sometimes the menu gets stuck or doesn't let me switch to European servers. Only a restart fixes this. Not a biggie but still annoying.- The game lobby feels very bare bones. I guess this is work-in-progress, but should be mentioned imo. An atmospheric game lobby, maybe a proper shooting range with animated NPCs would be really cool. Or let the player base create their own through the workshop? Currently it's only plain grey walls with a rudimentary tutorial.If this game receives frequent updates and the dev listens to the community, then I'm certain that this game will get huge in the long-run.Well done davevillz!"

Although there are only two game modes: ""Team Deathmatch"" and ""Search and Destroy"" both of them play well. There's three well ballanced maps. A good variety of weapons and the shooting mechanics feel good. The only problem I've had is some motion sickness my first hour of playing. I got over it by stuffing a sock in the headset to block one of the screens. I played that way until I got used to the movement (around 4hrs) and now I'm golden. Just played an hour and a half straight without feeling dizzy."

The main strengths of this game are the community maps and its inclusion of bots, which allow for less work (and therefore higher quality) from the small team that's making the game. But, the AI can always be better as it seems to do that wait for x seconds then have perfect aim thing that so many FPS games have.

Worried about waiting around in a lobby after you die? Don't. Pacing is much quicker than other VR round-based FPS available and the headshots are probably the most satifying thing I've come across in VR multiplayer. With a new update coming before the end of July (as I date this review once again) and league teams forming on the Discord, now is the time to join! Also, I know this is a review of the game, but one thing I've learned with VR is that a multiplayer game is only as good as it's community. The numbers are growing each day on the chat channel and in the game servers. With friendly people instead of a bunch of Tryhard McTacticools, learning the simple mechanics is a snap. With a price that is more than fair on top of all of the above - you're running out of reasons NOT to buy this great game.(this is the old review)I have played both before and after Update 9, (Lag comp, Weapon tweaks)  and this update took an already solid foundation and knocked it out of the park.-Armor hits to kill has been cut down, weapons fire more accurately and don't feel like BB guns anymore. headshots are extremely satisfying.- My favorite addition is the bullet hits slowing down a target - no more absorbing bullets in a dead sprint at someone for a knife kill.In short, this is THE TDM VR experience at the moment - hands down. There are other game modes (search and destroy etc.) but the lobbies seem to be filled with TDM games, S&D sprinkled in here and there. A solid foundation with a responsive developer at a fair price. Buy it."

,Recommended,555160,30242066,Posted: 28 February,all,Tuuvas,"Pavlov VR has pretty striking resemblances to Counterstrike, but it by no means feels like a cheap rip off or anything.  Whether intentional or not, this game needed to build a solid foundation, and what better place to look to for inspiration than a legend in the traditional FPS genre. Pavlov VR already feels like it is going to be setting a standard for the FPSVR genre - right up there with SuperHOT and Arizona Sunshine.With that said, there are still some issues (as of Feb 28, 2017) with Oculus/Touch controls.  There is Touch support; however, the locomotion with forward facing cameras in mind is quite lacking.  Turning is not exactly intuitive at the moment as this can only be done by holding left/right with the left thumbstick and simultaneously pressing B or A (forgot which) on the right Touch controller.  This can be quite troublesome as the left thumbstick ALSO controls forward/back/left/right movements, causing you to strafe while attempting to turn.All-in-all Pavlov VR is already quite impressive despite being early in development.  Even with Oculus/Touch support being a bit lacking, I am still able to thoroughly enjoy this game for hours already.  You eventually learn to cope with the strange turning options, but it would be nice to see something similar to Arizona Sunishine where the right thumbstick controls left/right/180 turns and movement is based on head direction instead of controller.If you want to experience one of the better First-Person Shooters in Virtual Reality, Pavlov VR is a MUST have. Great work with the game so far!P.S. to Dev - Let me know if you'd like someone to test Oculus-related issues.  I really feel like you've got a gem of a game in the works, and I would love to help out.  I've got experience in QA testing and writing testcases, so if there's a place to contact you with bugs, please let me know."

I can say this is one of the best vr games I ve played so far and one of the only games that makes me go back to it daily. It is deffinitely worth the money and one of the best experiences you can have in vr so far. I cant really compare it to onward as I didnt play it much before refunding but from the gameplay I ve seen, pavlov is more casual and fast paced  and also runs much better. There are tons of great custom maps, for example de dust 2 from counter strike and some maps from call of duty. Also its very satisfying to grab your empty mags, throw them away and reload your guns. The gunplay is great allthough time to kill might seem too long at first if you dont try to aim for the head. I had to play a few games however to get used to the controls and the locomotion system but after a while I got used to it completely. I kept dropping my gun by letting go of the grip button and could not reach the floor to pick it up. That was very frustrating but I fixed the issue. The only cons for this game is limited player base and games you can join, most of the time you ll be playing in US servers so you might lag if you dont live there, but you can also play offline with bots. Also it would not hurt to add more guns. Another annoying bug is that your hands might appear reversed if you dont select your main hand in steam vr before launching the game. Definitely recommend"

Just been playing against bots and hitting a headshot and watching their helmets fly off is very satisfying, no framerate stuttering or anything (i5 & 1080), no need to supersample as crystal clear with the ingame settings. Even if online wasnt that great (which I havent tried yet) the game is worth the small price tag for just the bot experience."

A good balance between realistic and arcade• Bot support (also in the cons)Cons:• Some of the guns feel terrible to handle (bullpup ironically)• Some of the guns don't seem to shoot where the sights are (like totally unreasonable variance)• The bullet spread is WAY too high on a couple of guns (UMP shouldn't have a spray pattern like an M60)• Bots are AWFUL. Often they will just stand in place and provide zero resistance to the enemy team.• Players are bullet sponges.• The community.• • No anti-grief measures to stop team killing trolls• • No muting individual playerWorst of all is the community. 90% of my games I'm being team killed in spawn. After a couple of rounds of one person wiping out our whole team in spawn everyone leaves and I'm stuck with a team of really poorly programmed bots against a team of real players. And this is not some edge case. This kind of crap is extremely regular. In about 15 games I haven't had one where I wasn't getting teamkilled by some troll.The developers *have* to put in some kind of autokick for team killers. Everything else is pretty secondary."

Although the bots are not very intelligent, it atleast gives you something to shoot at when your learning the map and game controls, and over time I'm sure they too will get an upgrade, but it is made for humans to play against other humans so other issues will be delt with sooner like other maps, game modes, or weapons.

,Recommended,555160,30310170,Posted: 4 March,all,SKΛTΞºʳÐ¡Ξ☠  [222],"I recommend it.It's definitely more on the arcade side.You can shoot them in the chest armor 10 times but Headshots are what really count.The only gun I seem to aim with is the sniper rifle.  80-90% of the time with every other weapon I shoot from the hip and see where my bullets are going.  (without ADS)I get that SCARFACE feeling when I'm just spraying and aiming with the gun at my hip.PROS-  Throw knives at people and they riccochet off the wall.-  Grenades roll.-  Make heads splatter with a Desert Eagle at point blank.-  Puting all weapons away and sprinting like it's Quake 3 Arena.-  The one map they do have is pretty good.-  When you die there's a beam of light that shows exactly where you got shot from and a red dot that shows where it hit you.-  Joins games really fast.  There's barely even a lobby.-  You can see bullets.  Might not be realistic but it's a f*cking VIDEOGAME and it helps.CONS-  Right away, GUN SOUND EFFECTS.-  When you're playing TDM online and you hear people say, ""Got him!""  ""I got him!""  ""Got one!""EVERY F*KING TIME?  We're getting 60+ Kills per round and you're calling EVERY KILL!?!?  GO F*CK YOURSELF!!!!  There is NO STRATEGY to TDM.  You spawn , you either kill or you die.  STFU!!-  In TDM when you die;  you respawn about 0.3 seconds later.  (No time to sip a beer?)  F*CK YOU TOO!Look, when people die.  PUNISH THESE P*SSIES FFS!!!!  (Make them wait at least) 5 seconds to respawn.Revenge is way too quick and where's the satisfaction in that?-  I'm getting really angry.-  There's only one really good map.QUESTIONABLE-  I felt when I sidestep it was moving really silent.  So I found myself strafing so people couldn't hear me.-  I accidentally clipped a wall a few times and saw the entire map for a split second.  Makes me wonder if people are clipping.VerdictI wish Onward and Pavlov would adopt a few things from each other.  It's like YIN and YANG!!!It's quick fun.  Respawn with different weapons.  Or plant bombs and purchase weapons.  It's whatever.You decide if you want Arcade or MilSim.  Or be like me.   BOTH!!"
76561198059796536,Recommended,555160,30253441,Posted: 28 February,all,Minia the Nine Tailed Fox,"Right, down to the big question. How does this compare to Onward?Pavlor's VR Shooter. Is it any good? Well, the short answer is yes. It's quite good. I've found plenty of fun in this game so far despite it being quite basic (yet still realistic) and not as complex as Onward. First thing I did when I got in the game was go to the training room to learn all the controls, equipment areas etc. The guns feel very solid and simple to use, a BIG problem for me with Onward was that my controllers would collide when I wanted to release the bolt on a weapon. This is not a problem I have found on ANY weapon in this game, it's extremely easy to swap magazines out, charge and then release the bolt handle.At the moment there is only 1 map in the game and it is a lot smaller than the maps you will find on Onward. However there is still plenty of room to move around and the map is of good quality. My eyes were not strained and I didn't have too much trouble killing enemies at long distances, apart from my disappointing accuracy. If the current map design is anything to go by then we should look forward to small, fast maps with plenty corners to check! However it would also be nice to dump the long corridors :)I also gave OOB locomotion a go to see if it was any good and it worked surprisingly well, however I'm already used to ""sliding around"" so i don't get particularly motion sick however this feature should help those of you not quite used to ""walking via sliding"" in VR. This is something that Onward lacked when I gave it a go. The only problem I had with it is that in the start area OOB would not work, this is a known issue that is to be fixed very soon.Offline mode works very well, the BOTs are tough but you can still get kills and stay on top the leaderboard if you are any good. It is a good time killer and I quite enjoy it, but there are some issues which I will now get into.For a start, there appears to be some bad lag in multiplayer. I know this may not be directly the game's fault however the amount of times I've been shot instantly before seeing an enemy player, or having shot at an enemy first in the back to then suddenly be killed before he even turns around and then hear him say ""haha noob"". Honestly, it gets frustrating after a certain amount of time. Just for fairness, I'm on a 5Ghz 76mb down and 24mb up connection.There is also the problem of team killers, at the moment there does not appear to be any sort of punishment for such people who teamkill on purpose, this is a problem that does require attention.Another problem is there is no HUD, you can't see your health or the time left in the game or a map with your teammates or anything as such. This isn't a big problem but I definetly see it as something that should be added to the game.Conclusion.Yes, this game is currently very good and very stable and generally better than Onward. I like to think that Onward is the Arma III of VR and Pavlor's the CSGO of VR. I fully support and recommend this game over Onward in both the games' current states.Pros:-Simple yet realistic-Good graphics-Well balanced guns-Good map design-Good bot design-Multiple gamemodes-Acceptable priceCons:-Multiplayer experience can be affected by lag-Only one map currently available-No OOB in training room-No HUD for health, timer, map etc"

Out of all the much more expensive VR games I've bought this has been by far the best investment.  Workshop already has a bunch of custom maps and there's always a match playing them.  Also, you can switch between the different movement methods.  Worth mentioning since most games seem to force you into what they deem best, and it's nice to have the option."
,Recommended,555160,30234191,Posted: 27 February,all,Daedalus311,"This game is a must buy for any CS:GO lovers.  The deathmatch mode lets you respawn in a few seconds, and you get to see who killed you, where they killed you from, and where the bullet hit you.  The search and destroy mode has 1.5 min rounds where one team places a bomb and the other team has to prevent the bomb from either being planting or from detonating (both planter and defuse have to input a numeric code on the bomb itself).Movement is fairly slow. I only notice how slow it is when I'm away from the action.  That';s when I'll holster my weapons so I can run and move about double the speed.The meat and potatoes of this game are the guns: each gun has its own damage output, recoil, reload, recharge to place a new mag's bullet into the chamber, and aiming sights.  The Deagle is incredibly powerful in the right hands and feels amazing to kill someone from across the map. Quite a few people complain about the body armor/helmet taking too many bullets to be killed.  While it does take a while and could be lowered, the game HEAVILY rewards shooting people in the face.The game currently only has one map, but it's quite large for what it is with many areas, routes to move through, etc.The dev said he was putting more out in the next month.  For $6 this game is one of the best deals out.Respawns can spawn you in front of an enemy, or behind an enemy.   Most of the time you're away from others, though.Grenades can be used to flush out or straight up kill enemies  from a good distance.Use your dominant hand's trackpad to bring up the buy menu each time you spawn . That's where you buy armor, weapons, and grenades. It also shows you how much money you have. You get more money by killing people.Always aim for the body or head. The rifles and Deagle will penetrate armor.When you're dead you can still move around the map to see the action.  It's teleportation movement for that.random things worth mentioning:-  the game runs on dedicated servers at 90 tick rate with servers in North America and Europe. You will experience very little lag in those regions.  Outside those regions I can not say what your experience will be.  Hopefully, it'd be just as great!- you can use the radio chat by clickin near the top left shoulder. Proximity chat is always on. You can hear your teammates and enemies talking.- you can run by holstering all weapons and double clicking the trackpad."

The biggest issue with this game (as well as that of many other VR games that try too hard to be realistic) is how it FORCES you to use only your body to turn instead of just allowing you to just your right stick for turning while using the touch controllers to aim and the headset to look around. That is what Doom 3 BFG VR allows you to do and it works perfectly. Having to actually move your entire body is very uncomfortable and makes for poor gameplay.Another example of how trying to make things too realistic makes for worse gameplay is how they force you to actually reach out for objects on your body instead of just allowing you to switch weapons via buttons. It sounds fun on paper but in practice it works poorly since there are often issues like wanting to pick something from your body but not being able to because you did not touch the intended area or item 100% correctly. In a MP shooter game where you can get killed at a moments notice this is not acceptable. The game would have played better if it had merged conventional fps controls with VR controls, similar to how Doom 3 BFG VR does.All in all great idea but poor execution."

Well this might be it.Vive is the land where a pretty good one man project is hailed as the second coming every other week. Could this deliver the goods?It's pretty ok to good shooter in it's early access state. It borrows alot of mechanics from Onward coupled with a more arcadey FPS feel, an instant respawn and one basic map. The insane people will live in this map for a few weeks, so that will become a problem for regular non adult diaper humans.Right now its pretty basic, but it works well(ish) even at this early stage. That is all it needs for short term success. Where it goes after that, who knows? Balancing an FPS is a very tricky bussiness for a team of people never mind one guy.

Some of the content is ""lifted"" from other games (Not saying that's good or bad, check out the Workshop content). Overall, the game is good for what it is, but there's definitely room for improvement.Pros:Gun models and sounds are well done.Oculus Rift with Touch is supported, even if the game was obviously designed around the Vive.Locomotion is good, no motion sickness.Cons:Player models are based on your height in real life, so prepare to bullet sponge with a s'quatch-sized hit box if you're taller than 6 feet, you freak. (Silver lining pro: you can immediately tell who is a little kid)Gun sights/usage/recoil are okay at best. RNG spread adds an element outside of your control. I suppose this fits the genre, as the game definitely leans more toward arcade style than realsim.Building on the comment above, hit damage is not really balanced. Empty a clip into someone with an SMG and as long as you don't hit 'em in the melon, they'll be A-okay. Firefights usually end with whoever gets the first headshot.Player base is still small, limited servers.There are some minor bugs to be expected for an EA game. In the few hours I've played, I've been unable to join multiplayer because of a <null> playername, gotten stuck on meshes in the middle of levels, been unable to pick certain things up off the floor, and had guns freeze halfway through reloading animations.The biggest annoyance for me is the sound environment. I can hear clomping boots, beeping bombs, or muffled voices from almost halfway across the map, but it's impossible to tell the distance. The enemy could be around the corner, across the road, or on the roof above me. There's no scale/direction, it's either ""on"" or ""off"" if someone is inside your sound bubble. Very confusing on levels with multiple floors, etc. It's quite an immersion ruiner for me, as sound can add a lot to the VR experience.I bought Pavlov because everyone said the player base for ""Bullets and More"" was dead and that this was a faster-paced game than Onward. I still do plenty of waiting around inbetween matches as a Pavlov ghost, however (where player observation, free locomotion, and snap-turning don't work), so I'll probably try Onward instead anyway. I'd pick this up if you are a huge fan of Counterstrike, but pass if that's not your cup of tea."

I know i only played 3hrs of this but it was enough to say it needs fixing, in the 3hrs i played my teammate got stuck on the ground like his feet were in a bear trap that he had to make some noise to have the other team kill him. But all these are minor , biggest issue for me and please listen to me , it was my body that doesnt sync with where head+controllers are facing so when i look down i the back instead of gun and nade infront me. This one more thing, every time i crouch trying to pickup my gun or knife or whatever , my holster and lower body is in the way , unlike onward when you bend over or crouch then you are facing the ground not through your body.

The teamwork, the classic Dust map from CS (I haven't played since CS 1.6, but it's the same map), and the fact that lobby chat everyone talks to each other.It really reminded me of when I first played Xbox Live in Call of Duty Modern Warfare, before Xbox parties existed so everyone was forced to talk to one another in the game lobby in between matches. You can talk crap about others on the opposite team... You can hear their MICs as well to figure out where they are. You actually work together.I really enjoyed playing and I really hope I can continue to jump on for 1 hour or 2 hour sessions playing some SnD since it's super fun!!!

The controls are easy to get used to and I love the whole kick back system where the weapon is totally uncontrolable if you're not stabilizing it with your off hand.The price is about right as you're not getting a whole lot of content at the moment. It would be great to able to find a game with a friend in your party. I also got a liiiittle bit motion sickness after 15-20 minutes but have yet to try the special motion sickness setting.

Sometimes you will come up behind a person, unload your entire clip on them, not kill the person, the person turns around and shoots you three times and you're dead. Some people (apparently) love this. I don't. I prefer the targets to not feel like human bullet sponges and I prefer more consistency: so long as you can aim well you can have fun. For that reason I prefer BAM over Pavlov VR.People are constantly comparing Pavlov VR to Counter-Strike. It's only like CS in one meaningful respect: you can purchase weapons when you spawn. Other than that, the claim that it is CS for VR is really just marketting that has been successfully parrotted. Back when this game was just a demo that couldn't even be purchased there were a handful of people on Reddit that were pushing this game hard on as the CS for VR. (i.e., the Developer and his friends decided this would be great marketing... guess they were right)."

In Onward you do frequently get shot right out of the gate, and then have to wait 3 or 4 minutes before playing again, so I think the automatic respawn is a great idea; however having to shoot your opponent in the face several times before they die reduces this game to too much randomness in my opinion. As someone that also has to work a full time job, I concede that it is frustrating to be consistently beat out by people who can play a game a 100 hours a week, but on the other hand I think that playing well should have some reward; otherwise for me at least, it feels like a waste of time. I think a middle ground needs to be found; how about keeping the respawn, but bullets being as lethal as they should be? This way a inexperienced player gets to stay in the action, but a skilled player can still rack up points and enjoy the satisfaction from playing well."

Quality of graphics is phenomenal, and the menu system is very intuitive and user-friendly. I have a i7-5820k and 980ti and was able to play the game at high/ultra setting with anti-aliasing enabled. I've also heard that the game uses forward renderer in Unreal Engine and you can use up to 4x MSAA if your GPU handles it, which is fantastic! Add to that the ultra-cheap low price of £7 (although I paid a discounted price of £4.19) and there's literally no reason not to pick this up. Gameplay wise it feels very fast-paced like CSGO although it might change in future as more maps and gamemods are added.

Unfortunately I can't recommend it yet because it has a long way to go before it's worth buying.First of all, there is only one map, it gets old pretty quickly and this is a really big con even for an early access game.Second, the time to kill is pretty ridiculous for this type of game. I shot an entire pistol magazine(I had the ""deagle"") into an enemy that was standing still not even facing me. While I was fumbling to reload he turned around and killed me. I'm not new to shooters by any means(check my play time if you like), this was clearly just a poor design choice imo.Third, there is a very minimal tutorial. You will absolutely run into players online who don't have a clue how to actually play the game, specifically planting, finding, or defusing the bomb. The tutorial simply doesn't explain those mechanics.With that said, sure, this game has potential like everyone keeps saying. But that doesn't mean you should buy it just because it could become something really fun. As it stands right now you will likely get bored very quickly and just go back to playing Onward.

The reason this has so many positive reviews is because it has team deathmatch so you're actually playing a lot more and so it's faster paced than Onward. I feel like nobody would even look at this game if Onward had deathmatch which is a simple addition and is probably coming soon. The gun recoil mechanic is absolutely atrocious in this game and enough reason to not pick this up.

I cannot tell you the ping of the competition.  It's fun, but like all VR - not able to handle competitive play.Edit 4/12/17Having read other negative reviews, the ""bullet sponginess"" sounds like latency issues.After further play I can better articulate the games issues.1) Dedicated servers are West Coast USA which makes for bad dedicated servers for other US players.  The lower latency gives you a high advantage even with the lag compensation the players commenting below claim the game has.  To be able to shoot someone, you have to lead your target, and you are at medium or point blank range.  That feels grossly unnatural.2) Unnatural body mechanics.  Part of the latency issue allows player to dodge bullets by strafing quickly left and right, so that you cannot lead them properly (to compensate for latency).  Also those unnatural body mechanics end up having player models break their elbows to fire a weapon.  And they manage to fire the weapon perfectly too.  I understand not having an actual weight to hold and buttstock to push into your shoulder affects gameplay; that comes with the territory of VR.  But if your character model has to dislocate limbs to fire a weapon, maybe have the weapon drop out of their hands, like the AWP if fired one-handed.3) Lack of asymetric maps.  Bridge should not exist.4) Seeing through walls needs to be fixed.5) The game fails to fully use room scale VR.  The locomotion is fantastic.  But if you try to sneak up to a corner using your own two feet, you will glitch/clip out of cover and be exposed to enemy fire.  Hugging any wall or corner will do this.I think it's time for me to move on to Onward."

Bomb, 2 places to plant it, you can run to get ahead with no guns in your hand.  Manual reloading, desert eagle, AWP..  Literally all the need are the dust maps and I'd play happily for a long time.  RIght now it's got the one map which is pretty good, but after many hours it gets a little stale.. but for $6 it's the first game (I have over 115 VR games) that I've been thinking about in off times and excited to play it.  Vive has been collecting a bit of dust lately, nothing has kept me interested for long, and who knows maybe it will wane eventually but right now I'm into it.  I also have onward and BAM, played them both a bit but in a few days I've already outplayed them both.  The lag compensation patch made a big difference for me.Future things I'd like to see:-More maps, especially DUST maps and maybe a bank map would be cool-Maybe even a map editor???-Some small tweaks, like auto 2 handed pistol mode when close (like onward)-Player customization-More guns-Some more details to enhance the firefight like car windows can shatter, more things can be destroyedGET IT!"

It just shows some guys clipping through some plants and pots in the beginning of the video and I was not very impressed with the video at first. I took a chance with my friend on this and it paid off though, the game looks much better than the video shows.I would also recommend fixing the server browser because sometimes it doesn't show servers. I would change the whole ""pull trigger and menu button at the same time"" It's very ackward and I was confused if you were talking the menu button for Oculus Home/SteamVR, then realized later it was the same button as the scoreboard.Last thing, the game did not work at first with the touch, my hands were reversed and I almost refunded.

For now, know that single player offline content is lacking, but the game is very fun.  Calibration is done well already.  I also love the menu but it could use a ""back to lobby"" option.  The weapons are all very realistic and require some hand eye coordination to use properly.  The dual-handed feature is done well from what I can tell.  This game could use a climbing feature and maybe some moving scenery, like birds.   I'd like to see more environment interactivity than breakable glass.  For example, I'd like to see elevators, breakable floors, breakable doors, and killable birds.  I'd also like to see more in the lobby, but I'm assuming that's already on the roadmap.I have not tried online mode yet, because my controllers somehow died after just 20 minutes.

It's a different style of shooter than Onward - faster paced with deathmatch and you don't die as easily.  The guns are less accurate in Pavlov than in Onward (I don't know which is more realistic), making it more difficult to hit people.The controls need work, especially on Oculus.  Snap-turning is a MUST ADD for us players on a front facing setup.  There is kind of a snap turning method, where you press the B button while pushing the thumb stick of the opposite hand in the direction you want to turn (confusing, I know), but it quickly gives me motion sickness.Sound design, at least for individual weapon noises like reloading, is much better in Pavlov than in Onward.Overall, I'm looking forward to future updates and hope that they make the game more accessible for front facing players."

I have never played Onward, but the controls in this are very nice.  I love the locomotion style.  The guns seem super realistic.  Love the voice chat, and how you can ""use your radio"" by holding your left hand up by your ear, very goofy and funny.Things I wish it had:- More maps- More game modes- Better indication of score (like in death match I can't tell how many kills/deaths I had)"
,Recommended,555160,30274696,Posted: 2 March,all,G-Dub,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzy4aVto0CMHere are a few things I liked about this game:- Two modes of team fast-paced FPS action with fast respawns!- Intuitive locomotion: Trackpad movement lets you strafe, backup, or locomote in the direction your weapon is pointing, which means you can look behind you while running forward, very immersive. Plus you can use room-scale to shoot around corners or take cover.- Several weapon types, all of which look and feel great, realistic kickback, and reloading feels realistic enough to make you feel like an action movie star but not so realistic that it feels like a chore. Forcing you to hold two handed weapons with two hands else deal with unmanageable kickback adds to the immersion. (Grenades and knifes are fun too!)- Healthy playerbase for now!- Includes single player vs bots mode with various difficulties for those that may not want to dive into online combat right away.- Great value (Marked down to $6 from $10 right now!)"

There is a couple of things that I would like to see changed/ fixed. I notice the weopons are not perma buy, It really sucks when the Deagle shows up in your hand cause it F-en sucks! I have much more chance of eliminating someone with the regular pistol than the eagle. Also something I noticed, well two things. I spawned with a sniper rifle so when i got to my position I laid down on the floor and sat my handgun next to my face area that way if i needed it, I could just grab it and shoot, the thing is when it was time to shake the spot and no longer needed my rifle I dropped it so i can get my handgun and looked around and it was gone, so i stood up and said oh well I'll just grab my rifle and then  I noticed that was gone too. So there I am with no guns... just a knife and a grenade. So I would like to see player weapons not disappear untill the player gets eliminated. Also later on i wanted to see how i looked when i was laying down so i used the little out of body teleporting system, and it ends up that my character was just squating with his gun on the floor. So you cant lay down.Before I finish this. The way you get around in this game is two ways. One is the default way, where you use your pad (vive) so you move yourself around like a player on a console, now the problem for me, with this one is, since its a touch pad, if you accidentaly touch it you go running in an unexpected direction at an unexpected time. everytime i try to shoot someone i touch it in accident and there I go. The other thing about this mode for me personally is it makes me freakin sick to my stomach, I tried to evade gun fire by dropping to one knee and moving behind a barrier, WOW what a mistake, It made me feel weird and i lost my balance and fell back on my @ss at like 3a.m. and im sure my downstairs neighbor didnt appreciate that. The second way to get around is kind of like the teleporting system. But its done in a way where you pick a spot to go and your character goes running to that position. Its like watching your soul leave your body while your camera moves in increments behind him. This way works best for me, but as far as I know, you cant sprint in this mode, and when someone catched you during your out of body experience youre pretty much at the biggest disadvantage possible in this game.Oh i forgot to mention, the bullet damage needs to be increased for all guns.But besides all of that. If youre on the fence and thinking about this game, I would just buy this game. For the price you cant go wrong. and the bonus part is if you never loaded a gun in real life you'll now officially know how. Do you know you dont have to charge your weapon if there's still one bullet in the chamber? I did'nt, but now I doRecommend."

Did find myself getting a tad motion sick with normal movement, changed to teleport and it was very difficult to experience. Not a fan of this constant snapping to positions whilst the character is moving. I'd much prefer to just wait whilst the character moves, THEN teleport as atm it's not a good alternative to motion sickness."

I love the quick play style and random weapons.Only criticism so far is that guns should do a bit more damage. You often have to unload half a magazine to bring down an opponite, while someone can rush you with a knife and still kill you quicker. Ever after you have shot someone 4-5 times, they can still manage to knife you in a rush (if you can't manage a headshot that is). Its completely unrealistic, but meh, what can you do.Servers are still having issues with lag, so hitting a moving target can be challenging. But does not detract from the experience."

I've played maybe one round with people, because satellite doesn't do so well with multiplayer games, and the rest of my time has been against bots.The controls feel solid, with the exception of reloading occasionally. I'll go through the full animation, but have to chamber a round twice in order to get the gun to fire. Sometimes I have to get my controllers at the right angle to pick stuff up off the floor, and I also unintentionally clack my controllers together when I reload, those are my only issues I've had.I tend to be a terrible shot when I play, but I'm learning where to point the gun and how to use the iron sights.

The flashbang also looks weird when you get flashed, its grey instead of a traditional bright white and you can still hear everything from footsteps to gunshots."

One issue I'm seeing is many players have very short characters put holding the guns way above their heads. This is frustrating and I hope gets fixed by the developer (he seems extremely involved)."

The game you play all day and then shut it off, then turn it back on the next day. I may have found it, atleast for the next few days.It takes a while to get used to, and the rift touch support isn't the best, and my 180 tracking solution is a pain sometimes, but man is this game fun.There's only 3 maps at the moment, but with workshop intergration everyone is playing Dust2 and other wacky maps remade or even imported from other games. I can't wait to see how this progresses."

Especially with the workshop released and reliving classic FPS maps from Unreal, Battlefield and COD.  Nice.  Also great for the thighs, abs and quads, stay low...stay slow.  Want to burn calories?  Add some weight bands around the wrists to simulate rifle wieght."

I have spent the vast majority of my VR time with Onward. After seing the video and reading comments I decided not to buy this Pavlov game. It was a huge mistake. Now after testing the game I know that it is a trully great Counter-Strike / Onward like game. A must have if you like Onward and Counter-Strike."

The movment system at first is very disorienting but you can overcome that by walking around a little

,Recommended,555160,35055697,Posted: 18 September,all,grantgamesgames,"Huge variety of levels and some great workshop levels that bring back CS nostalgia with modern gameplay. Great weapon interactions, using your iron sights and sniper rifle are fun and easy. The game feels fair and well balanced for the most part, and can be very challenging if you're playing with a good group. Best VR FPS out there.PS This game is far better than Onward. If you enjoy sitting around for 10 minutes while the other team finds you in the level, buy Onward. If you enjoy waiting for all your other teammates to die, get onward. If you enjoy simplistic visuals, get Onward. If you enjoy playing the same boring levels over and over again, play Onward."

,Recommended,555160,35214672,Posted: 25 September,all,Aurel Tristen,"Simply put, it's Counter Strike in VR, and I mean that in the best way possible.  But beyond CS, it includes some cool features like:-Positional VOIP which is occluded (muffled) when coming from another room-Radio coms (grab your right or left shoulder, as if there is a mic there)-A growing collection of community made mapsRight now it suffers from the same problems as any other VR game.  It's hard to see things in the distance, so it's hard to do mid to long range shooting.  Sniping is much harder in this game, as it should be.  But the scope is so reflective you can't see through it some times.Bugs I've run into (as of 9/25/2017)-Somtimes it is difficult to reload pistols because you can't grab the slide-Grenades are very hard to throw properly-It's hard to pull grenade pins with your right hand when holding in the left-Players TK with the knife a lot, often by accident-There is NO LEANING, so if you think you're being sneaky leaning around a corner, your whole body is below your head.  This makes it impossible to properly lean out windows or over edges, which is a bit of a shame-Some players seem to be able to see through smokeOverall, a great game.  Probably one of the best VR games I've played."

One of my favorite VR games, good community, high fun factor, easier to play than other FPS VR games.  The workshop means there are new levels almost weekly.  The Counter Strike levels are awesome to play."
,Recommended,555160,34533918,Posted: 27 August,all,A Slothful Bong,"One of the most absurd, fun, and pulse-pounding games available in VR right now. There's nothing like attempting to reload a gun while an enemy approaches with a knife, only to drop the clip, drop the gun, pick up the gun, manage to get the clip in, only to forget to pull the bolt back and die a terrible death. Or to throw a grenade and after a few seconds, realize you forgot to pull the pin.The default movement controls do introduce some motion sickness in certain people, but there's an OOB mode which should help counteract that."
