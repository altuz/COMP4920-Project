I didn’t liked much the “true ending”, but the essence of the story was really interesting. I’d play another game by those devs, I hope there’s more to come!6/10."
,Recommended,555210,29711787,Posted: 4 February,all,¡SpaceCowboy¡,"It is a really story. I recommend it if you like stories with very relaxed play styleYou can play this while you are falling trying to sleep or just wanting to relax a little bitAnd i have to add:The game has 8 ending,tThe fastest ending(ouf of all 8) can be achived in 10 minutes. However this is not really an ending. It is a fail ending, lets say. Or in gamer terms, it is being ""defeated""The game has one ultimate the most positive ending. All other ending are actually building stones for the story for this big bang ending. However you can only have that ending if you go through all other endings first.While you are playing the game, you should save the game at all decision points so later you load and see the other options."
76561198176783878,Not Recommended,555210,29741763,Posted: 6 February,all,Oceanic~Lullaby,"Review for the English version:Needs a proper editor. I made it ten minutes in before I quit the game. The translation is pretty bad, full of run-on sentences, misused words, and constantly jumping between past and present tenses. I understand that English is probably not a native language for the development team (judging by the writing in their developer updates), and that's perfectly fine; but if you release a visual novel (i.e. a written work) that's badly written, you're going to get a bad review.Objectively speaking (i.e. not judging by the plot or characters or any of the creative aspects, but purely from a factual stance on the writing and grammar), this game is bad.DISCLAIMER: WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY NEXT IS PURELY MY OWN OPINION. I HAVE NO EVIDENCE FOR ANY OF IT.I find it highly suspicious that the first game from an unknown development team (at least, unknown in the English VN circle) has almost 1500 reviews, and 3 curator reviews, after one month. What's more, 100% of the helpful/recommended reviews are positive, and almost all of them have been voted on 20+ times. The play times of these reviewers vary from 2-3 hours to as much as 13+ hours (which contradicts with the play times of the most recent reviews, some of which are less than 1 hour). Two of the helpful/recommended reviews are almost identical; to paraphrase, they both praise the true ending, and are both one sentence long in total. These are all my unbiased observations, and I have done no further research into these observations to turn them into anything more. Take them for what you will.END DISCLAIMER."

,Not Recommended,555210,30044510,Posted: 19 February,all,mashumaro,"Personally didn't care for it. The English translation needs a lot of proofreading as it's full of errors and clumsy, awkward phrasing. The story is good enough to keep me interested but the mood often abruptly changes unexpectedly. For example, a scene where you're in a dark forest and fearing for your life and then the main character is suddenly regretting that he's not popular. The story moves way too quickly for me, it doesn't give you time to understand the motivations of the characters on any more than a basic level and then they have sudden unexplained mood swings; changes of heart, etc that make me feel like there's a lot more going on that was just skimmed over.It has potential, but in it's current state feels like a beta or trial version."

You are awesome and I can't wait for your next project! Anywho, Trick and Treat is an interesting VN. It surprised me to put it bluntly with it's story and characters. It had, in my opinion, a very interesting story that hooked me to find out more and characters that I had formed close bonds with!In a quick summary of the game's basic plot: You are Axel, a 17 year old highschool student who goes out on Halloween night with his two friends Alfred, and Steven to investigate a strange forest where people have mysteriously disappeared. It's from there that the game is a roller coaster ride of effective atmosphere, tension, and emotions. The music is great and add's to the scenes, the characters are memorable and are easy to get attached to, the story is interesting and emotional, and the overall vibe of the game is dark and lonely. Those last two of which perfectly sync with the themes of the game (Halloween and etc...).Those are the good things but this game does have it's share of flaws. For one, the text is sometimes poorly written and grammatically incorrect at times. And sometimes there are plot points that aren't (or are poorly) explained and story moments in the game that make you go: ""Wha? ....Huh what? I don't-I don't understand-"". Other than those flaws, I absolutely loved this game and would definitely recommend to everyone. Please, show your support to the makers of this so they can continue to make amazing games!Overall I'd give this game a final verdict of8/10"

The guy who made this game uses the words ""arrogant"" and ""annoyance"" almost every other dialogue, it's like it's the only words he knows. Besides that, how he uses 'arrogant' makes it seem like a sheltered boy who can't break out of his friend group (if he has one irl) because of a social isolation bubble caused by a traumatically lonely (and probably religeous) upbringing, with a quiet and similarly sheltered single mother presiding over anything other than non-stop confinement to his bedrooom in front of a computer with no internet wrote this.Also, the grammer is terrible, the characterization is lame [read: ""non-existent""], and the squeemishness of its author seeping through its every pore speaks of the 'stench of death' mentioned in the game as that of its own soul, that of a child terrified to make a stand.

While the graphics are not exactly the most visual stunning you will see, they are competently done and do their job well enough.  Beyond a few spelling and gramatical errors, the writing is quite good and the story is worth a couple of hours of your time. It's good to see something on the main page that isn't an asset flip or never to be completed early access title. I hope to see more titles from Eternal Night Studios."

For a free VisNov.After playing through the entirety of the game and unlocking all endings, I have to say I was actually quite disappointed. With all of the extremely positive reviews floating around, I can't hep but wonder if any of the reviewers have actually read a decent story before, in a Visual Novel medium or otherwise. I understand that English was not the original language that the game was written in, so I am giving it a pass for all grammar and instances of awkward wording, but for the story to be so incredibly bland and contrite it can't be given a pass merely because of translation issues. I hate to go against the grain here, but the whole experience was kind of meh and lackluster. Both girls are one dimensional, the main character is inconsistent at best and a very poorly handled player-insert character at worst, the scenarios are extremely contrived, the romances are completely out of the blue and intensely underdeveloped, and the story itself was a typical cliche ""dumb kids do dumb things on Halloween because of the village legend and find out it's true"" fare.If you're bored and have some time to spare, it isn't bad for the price of free, but if you actually want a good story, you're better off looking elsewhere."

The Visual Novel has multiple endings with one of them piecing the story together whilst others having different outcomes to the story.

After picking out random words I was able to determine that it was October 31 and I was in some spooky woods (the backgrounds and dates appearing on the screen really helped with that). I think there was a flashback at one point, during which I think there was a Wikipedia search. After making my first choice, and not knowing what it was, I died 5 minutes later (at least I think I did, there was the word FIN in red with some drippy stuff off it). The whole process took 19 minutes.Second TryPlayed in English. Turns out the game actually has an interesting, plot twisty story, and that also I was pretty much wrong about what I thought I knew about the first playthrough.Turns out it wasn't a Wikipedia search.After that, I got through it pretty quickly, and it was fun. I'd recommend saving often so that you don't have to back track too much to reach choices so you can explore all the paths. There are some minor translation problems, and a few passages which simply don't flow too well, but I don't pay enough attention in English class to care about that. It was good. And free."

Logical connection between choices and outcome2. Something more than a superficial concept on which to build a story3. Plot, characterization, emotion, conflict, good writing...visual doesn't make it a novel. If I want a pictue book, I'll read Goodnight, Moon.4. At least make the reader care about the characters -- much can be forgiven if the characters aren't cardboard5. Avoid silly dialogue and response - in this one, the most common words were idiot and angry.You get what you pay for ... except when you don't. The ratings on visual novels are much less reliable than the ratings on games."

If you came for a good story, you're in the wrong place. The story is dumb and full of witches and cats people and all sorts of other♥♥♥♥♥♥that doesn't make sense. The story is uninvolving and the characters are unrelatable. If you came for the artwork... well, you'll be disappointed in that too.

Not just with this book but with Lilian and Ashly. The way you were able to turn little words and pictures into feelings is unfathumable for me to even comprehend. I love you lastly. You created something that I was able to enjoy with my little time on this planet. You gave me a smile (and tears) on this planet and makes my life that much better. That you if you read this and are still with me. I reccumend this visual novel with all my heart and if you decide not to download it and read it then you are missing out. And make sure you find all the endings it will be worth your time. Author of this novel thank you once again and keep enjoyings your time on this time. Also if you make any other visual novel please message me on steam and I will gladly read it.

There are quite a few endings and each one gives you more information about the situation you're in, finalizing it with the last ""hidden"" ending.Without spoiling anything; a few tips:- After playing through every ending other than the last, replay it. There will be a new option somewhere- Go in without reading anything about the story or endings- Attempt to find all the achievements without using a wiki or guide. It's well worth it."

76561198036127796,Recommended,555210,30003130,Posted: 18 February,all,eric4eric,"I have mixed feelings about this game/kids story.  It was definitely worth it for free, but I would have been disappointed if it was more than $1.  I gave it a thumbs up because it is free.What I liked about it was the cute story and innocent childlike graphics.  However, I wish they would improve the speed of play.  The speed is almost unbearably slow.  By way of background, it is not really a game or a movie.  It is a kid's “choose your own” story with very few story choices.  The frustrating part is that the single lines become visible in a slow fade with only one sentence at a time.  I spent half an hour “playing”, or more aptly reading, what I would have preferred to read in just over five minutes - and I am not a fast reader.  The game becomes a game of clicking as fast as you can to get the damn text to display quick enough to read before your conscious drifts off to sleep.I think the game/story would be drastically improved with a  mechanism that allowed the reader to view and read whole paragraphs or pages.  One complete storyline takes just under 30 minutes (clicking at inhuman speeds) and allows for about 3 choices.  There is an option to play the other story lines (and you can fast forward through what you already read).  However, I did not have the patience to do so.All in all, it is slow and a bit boring, but the cute, innocent childlike graphics and story are nostalgic enough to remind one of childhood daydreams.  I think the reading/story level might be good for a ten year old, but I don’t think most ten year olds would have the patience for it.I wanted to like this book, but I can only give it only about 3.5 out of 10 stars - worthwhile for a free book, but not for much money.  If they can fix the speed issue, then I would raise my opinion dramatically.  I hope the author will accept my apologies for being so critical."

,Recommended,555210,29847861,Posted: 11 February,all,XnJester,"Let's start with a quick Pros and Cons list and then I'll add some depth to the review.Pros+ Engaging Story+ Emergent Story+ Unexpected Variant Endings+ Quality ambient music throughout+ Best ending saved 'til last (MUST complete other endings to unlock)+ No Nudity, No Sex scenes (except passionate kissing), No language, No Dating+ None of the other immature 'mature' content that some authors resort to in order to increase interest in their story.Cons- Translation to English is not always strong- Fairly basic images- Images don't always show the story as written- First few endings seem arbitrary- Long periods of reading with very few choices- Dialogue lacks depth at timesMore DetailStarting off I was quite disappointed in this game. It calls itself a visual novel, but very little variety in the very basic visuals left me feeling that I'd wasted my money on this game (and the game is FREE).The early story feels very contrived and very predictable, in pretty much the same way as the back story of almost any cheap RPG does. I mean, seriously, three teenage boys going to spend their Halloween night in the woods where others have disappeared on past Halloweens. You have to admit that sounds as contrived as you would ever find in any game.After my first very abritrary seeming death, the only thing that kept me hanging in there was pure stubborn-ness. The game had good reviews, so surely the other choice had to be better.Each alternate path adds to the storyline, while cleverly introducing questions about the real story that kept me unsure until the very end of the final (unlocked) ending.What appeared to be a B-grade Halloween horror story turned into a well-constructed A-grade 'not horror' story (no spoilers here).It took me three hours to read through all the possible endings. So, this game is quite playable in one evening.If you have read this far in my review, let me suggest something to you. I think the story unfolds quite well if you experience the endings in an order. Without micro-analysing the endings to come up with a specific order that you would have to write down or come back and read, here's an easy way to do it that will still work well for the story:When you a given a choice to make in the game, hit ESC and save your game on the decision screen. Always take the first option whenever given a choice. After you've seen the ending, LOAD the last choice made and take the other path (all choices are binary). This will get some of the poorer endings out of the way early, and the story will unfold interestingly later (remembering that you will need to see all the endings and if you don't read your way to each ending you will miss important plot points, even on the 'bad' endings).Graphics: 3/10Music: 7/10Story: 9/10Replayability: 2/10Overall: 8/10This game gives a good payoff for persevering.Incidentally, this is one of very few games that I have got all the Steam Achievements for."

The music and design is nice and the story is very expansive in terms of how the user can experience it. However the game draws on a bit too much at the start and offers a more set story rather than choices to influence the story which only become prevalant at the end.Give it a try. My recommendation is to really soak up the story during the 'setup' to get the most out of this game. good for a freebie.

On the other hand I think the story is worth exploring as it has certain meaning and depth to it. Once unlocking the different endings and comparing them i got even philosophical about how we perceive and decide in our life, and how we may be getting unknowingly farther from completeness and wholeness by judgement and sticking to a ""friend or foe"" mindset. So while I'd have enyojed a more sophisticated graphical design with a bit more to absorb, the girls look beautifull anyway and I'm happy that I've played this.After all it gave me all I was looking for, a bit of an escape to a fantasy world - while at the same time to my biggest surprise it presented me with an experience of higher meaning and food for thought which will probably stay with me as an abiding memory for long time."

Big suprise there.it licked my arm after I had recieved an open wound, and then led me from the forest.on my seccond play through I became familliar with the other five victims of the curse, God they loved hanging around that cabin....all in all, Ive played this game a few times now, seen some of the endings and will definitely be playing again to see the others.7/10Reccomendations to creator:Get a couple more graphical artists working on your characters. I would have loved to see some of the fight that went down ilustrated!Get a slightly less repetative sound track, even just overlay some tracks at different times."

I'm not particularly impressed with the story because it's rather usual and some things doesn’t make very much sense and in my opinion less endings would have been enough. The soundtrack is fitting to that rather dark atmosphere. You can give it a try, but don't expect to much."
