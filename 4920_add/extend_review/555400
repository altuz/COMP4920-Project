,Recommended,555400,34269484,Posted: 15 August,all,Archaeos,"A True Dinosaur Survival GameI purchased Collision Course because I have been searching (for years) for a dinosaur survival game that would accurately simulate being trapped in the prehistoric. This is by far the closest any game has come to meeting that personal wish. The reason this game is different from the likes of Ark, Saurian, The Isle, and any other dino game currently on the market, is because it pits you, as a human, up against beasts that you stand no real chance of defeating. There is no playing as the dinosaur, there is no riding or taming the dinosaurs. This is where the game shines. These beasts remain vicious and terrifying predators and on the off chance you happen to encounter one, you'll find yourself actuallyafraidof them. As far as I'm aware, this is the only game to do this, and even though it is in its infancy it is already doing right what so many others have done wrong.Pros:Amazing AI. The dinosaurs don't immediately attack you. They will ""investigate"" you before deciding whether or not it is a good idea to attack. If they take damage and don't see you they will run away, as if startled. They are able to smell dead carcasses, hear gunshots, and see flashlights.Exceptional Dinosaur Models. The dinosaurs in the game look as good if not better than the environment. You can tell that the devs took their time in creating them. When they're walking around, sniffing the air, and investigating sounds it looks as if they are actually alive.Perfect number of dinosaurs per area. You likely won't see a dinosaur for a while and this is how it should be. You'll be spending most of your time exploring the environment looking for rocks and sticks to craft with. When you do see a dinosaur it will often take you by surprise. Making the dinosaurs a rare sight adds to the suspense when you finally do encounter one.Beautiful Environment. The game looks amazing not only because it is in Cryengine 3 but mostly because of the time you can tell the devs put into crafting the environment. The forests are so lush and covered in undergrowth that I've actually walked straight into a raptor while wandering through the forest.Good Ambiance. Another thing that can make or break a game like this and this game does it fairly well. There are the usual crickets chirping/frogs calling, distant dinosaur calls, and the dinosaurs actually roar occasionally (which sounds amazing/terrifying). They each have different calls so it is easy to determine if what you just heard is harmless or something to worry about.Combat feels good. Whether it is with a dinosaur or a competing survivor, throwing your spear through the head of your attacker feels solid and weighty, just like combat should. Although the guns feel a little useless sometimes I'm alright with this since I would prefer it if they weren't even in the game and the player used only primal weapons.Great Story/Endgame Ideas. The fact that there is futuristic technology on this planet turned me off of the game at first. I wanted a purely prehistoric game, and I still do. But, this game has a good explanation for the technology and it isn't so abundant that it makes the game easy. The cyborg is an awesome final fight and I can't wait to see how they expand on the story.Cons:Buggy and Unoptimized. I have a decent setup (Nvidia Geforce GTX 770/Intel i7) and I have to play this game on low in order to have a good experience. I would not currently recommend this game to anyone with a low end computer. Although I did not experience any crashes, I have seen others that have experienced several crashes.Save system. I personally don't like being able to save whenever I want. I would rather the game have a permadeath system or an autosave feature at important points. This would make the game even more challenging and make the dinosaurs even scarier since you will likely be starting over if you attract their attention.Very minimal content. As of writing this review the game is in version 0.05 and there is hardly anything to do in the game. I made and acquired every item in the game as well as completed the storyline and I'm barely at 8 hours of playtime. There also aren't that many different types of dinosaurs. Despite this I feel that the time was worth it, I just wish there was more to do.Resources are very limited. This is the biggest issue that I have with the game. Currently you have to search for potentially hours to find 4 rocks and 4 sticks to build a campfire. Finding some of the flowers to cure your illnesses can also be near impossible. I would rather it be easy to obtain and craft items with many more items to make.ConclusionI really feel for these devs, from the splitting of their team to work on Saurian, to their failed Indiegogo campaign. I really hope they are able to add more content to the game and will continue to support their efforts. Overall, I feel that this is the closest a game has come to satisfying my desire for a true dinosaur survival experience. It is definitely worth the $10 in my opinion even though it is substantially lacking in content. In it's current state and for what it is I would give this game an,8.5/10mostly because it is daring to be different from what the majority of people seem to want in dinosaur games. And that is a good thing in my eyes."

Water looks amazing. The dinosaurs I've come across have looked pretty decent, the models are very well done but the animations can be a bit janky.Its difficult to talk about the game further than the surface because there isn't a whole lot here just yet. The crafting system is very bare bones. You can pick up ihighlighted items from the ground. Sometimes. The game will just not let you pick up items sometimes. The game also doesn't really point you in a direction other than, ""Explore, find items and don't get eaten.""There is a large area to explore with some very impressive visuals, but it does feel pretty empty in the animal/creature department. It doesn't feel very ""alive"". Could just be my bad luck but encounters with dinosaurs have been a bit rare. But, there are some very interesting things to find in this game. Things that aren't even mentioned in the description. Like getting high on mushroom spores and then being chased by the skeleton of a T-Rex. I think this game might have some really cool secrets that I'm excited to see people find.I feel like I wouldn't recommend the game normally. The fact that the price is so affordable is a big factor though. So if you're looking for a game to explore in that has some dinosaurs and interesting secrets. I would give this game a try. Here is some gameplay with no commentary if you would like to see some.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qhspLtHgroTLDRPros:Game is beautifulLarge area to explore and dinosaurs to run away fromSome extremely interesting secrets that honestly surprised mePrice is very reasonableCons:Performance isn't great. Averaging around 30 - 40 FPSThere really isn't a goal/direction to aim for other than surviveThe UI/HUD is not very good. Buttons aren't explained(accidentally ate a mushroom and died)"

Please don't make the mistakes other developers did such as becoming greedy or abandoning the game like the devs of TheHunter: Primal did. I'll say it again Collision Course has the most potential I've ever seen, it would be a shame to see it all go to waste. The concept is original and exciting so take your time with this one because you have a diamond in the rough."

I'm really impressed with the graphics it makes the open-world bigger and very immersive. The dinosaurs are amazing but I think the game could use more dinosaurs, not just dinosaurs but other prehistoric creatures. And there should be more different types of games like hunting a specific dinosaur or finding an item you know those objective type games. And add music which would give this video game a feeling of adventure and danger and mystery. Collison Course has my full support I'm really loving it. Exploring the open terrain while avoiding the carnivores and watching the herbivores. The more updates this game gets the more better and more fun it will be. So give Collison Course a go. And it's a heck of a lot easier than Ark: Survival Evolved."

This is due to some lower than expected sales of the game, which is understandable due to the nature of the indie game industry. We’re trying to create this game the right way, as gamers and supporters would expect. We aren’t selling out or abandoning a full price game with our pockets bulging, or making any grand promises that aren’t achievable. We're doing what we can with what we have, to the full extent. We were expecting to increase development as time went on but unfortunately it now seems we’ll have to slow things down a bit.""Basically this means they didnt get a bunch of easy money so for the next few months they may add some bug fixing until they abandoned the game. Ive seen it time and time again from early access games. I wanted to believe that this one had potential and it does. As of right now though, theres barely any acutal content. AVOID THIS GAME"
76561198162025783,Recommended,555400,29406647,Posted: 21 January,all,Blackshuck1988,This game is awsome. Granted is very bare bones but what is in is stunning In ultra settings yes there are bugs and the ai is clunky more so with the dinos. If your looking for a finshed product then this is not for you however if like me you can see the potential in the detail here then the price is more than reasonble. I really hope the devs see this game through. Honestly i could right a essay on why i like this game but the biggest thing for me is how it makes you feel the whole world is hostile from the earthquakes and volcanos to comets hitting the place and throwing up huge dust storms. Hope this review helps in making peoples minds up on this title.
,Not Recommended,555400,29115790,Posted: 8 January,all,Levia Draconia,"The only positive aspects of this game are currently the environment and the performance.It looks good and runs well, but that's about it. The animations are rather bad and the AI is just horrible and easy to kill and unfortunately there is nothing else to do in this game besides running around, killing AI and looting wrecks.Can't recommend the game atm, but I will keep an eye on the development."
,Recommended,555400,29248339,Posted: 14 January,all,Scabard,"Gameplay video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJQ6G-N4JskIt's very early access, at the time of writing there really isn't all that much to do but wander the woods and mountains looking for items to pick up. Much of which don't do alot. The Dinosaur AI is pretty dodgy too, you can kill many of them by simply walking up and beating it to death and it may not even react. It has some sort of climbing/vaulting mechanic that's really hit'n'miss too. Altogether it just feels really unfinished and really early, but it's early access and this game shows masses of potential.With that said, I can still recommend this game, for the price it's about what you would expect. You can't save, so it's like a single survival experience rather than a game. But it's got a good amount of atmosphere and the graphics are really good thanks to the Cryengine. The forest, in places, looks about as realistic as you could possibly expect in today's games and the sounds are very well done. It's actually quite scary at times with the occassional dinosaur related jump scare in the dead of night.If you fancy a walk in the woods with the odd bit of combat and heaps of atmosphere, you can get it here. Just don't expect a polished or bug free experience, this is one of those games that has a long way to go."

,Recommended,555400,29232879,Posted: 13 January,all,Zilla,"A dinosaur survival game, set in prehistoric enviroment, with overwhelming graphics... will this work out?Being absolutely honest I do hope it will, cuz it's been a while since I saw such beautiful game as this one, especially when it's still in Early Access. I played this game for like half an hour and I gotta say, I felt like in Cretacious peroid, where I spent some time in dense jungle, wet swamps, vulcanic rocks and other, interesting enviroments. The felling is so deep also, thanks to amazing enviroment sound which attacks our ears since the start. Also, we get to see random events such as earthquakes and asteroids hittig the ground, stiring up the dust, dense enough to cover the sunlight. It's actually plot related, so be looking for similar activities durning ur gameplay session . While my 'walk in the park' I've encountered few species of dinosaurs, unfortunatelly without the ferocious T-Rex, and I gotta say, they all look fantastic. Best dinosaurs I've ever seen. It's not only dinosaurs which we will encounter but also other surprises, which u must check out by urself. I won't spoil♥♥♥♥♥♥..This game is beautiful, it has one of the best sounds I've ever heard, the plot related stuff such as spaceships, lying on the forest bed look stunning and give some mystery to the place where we found out to be. So thos are the pros of this... what about the cons then?As the devs say, this game now is bare bones. Nothing else. U don't have nothing to do there, besides from your average fight for survival and believe me, it's quite easy to survive, since the dinosaurs tend to glitch in textures, as well as don't seem to follow you when they are on the open field, at least not for long. The animations are great, but for some Actions like for Stegosaurus tail swing, there's no animation at all. U just see it turning around, without any visible movement from the animal itself.U don't have any missions at all. Just walking around, find some random junk such as the knife or the pistol. We don't get any map, no gps, no nothing. Just walking and getting excited by the view. Another problem is that our unnamed character doesn't really like to react to our demands in terms of hitting the keyboard, especially when it comes to fight or jump. I pressed SPACE like 10 times and my dude jumped once and no more.As I said, this game is beautiful but sometimes the objects are showing in front of our noses. It's possibly because the graphic menu is really poor. U only get to enhance ur quality or the resolution. Nothing else.I do realise it's an early access game and I do have faith in it. I highly recommend u buy it. Sure, u get a cat in a bag, since it's now popular for devs to ditch the game, however I try to be optimistic and by buying this game, encouraging others to buy it and giving my feedback, I will encourage them to work harder over Collision Course, since the game has a big potential to be best dino-game ever released. I'm really looking foward for this project and I do hope that in the next year, at this time, we will get the full, prehistoric experience, thanks to this title. I wish you all and myself that.Take care and devs, please, do not screw this up I don't keep us waiting for next 65 milion years, to play this."

In some games it's ruined by the fact that once you wear steel armour and weapons, you can as well solo a t-rex. Here the approach is more realistic, and the sounds and sense of danger is awesome. On nvidia 960 the game runs more or less smoothly on medium/high settings."
,Recommended,555400,33310747,Posted: 6 July,all,Jimmy NoShoes,"Looks fantastic and decently optimised for modern systems in terms of FPS. There is huge potential for this game and I look forward to what these developers produce in the coming weeks/months.The AI is also pretty decent as well. I've had dinosaurs stalk me for a while and then attack when the time was right. I've also had dinos try and hide behind trees, its pretty cool to see.HOWEVER.The game is too bare bones at this stage to be of any fun for more than an hour or 2. I've spent a large majority of the time literally running around looking for items to actually do anything. There are frequent areas where you can get stuck and then cannot move, forcing a restart. Although the game has huge potential, there is too little to do at this stage. I have submitted a refund request which, if it does go through, would probably repurchase in half a years time provided there have been substancial updates to the survival part of the game and the crafting system.As it stands, there are only 2 items to craft and it has literally taken me the entire 2 hours of my playtime running around looking for 5 sticks to actually craft them. Not enjoyable in that regard.For the above reason, I kinda can't recommend it, but at the same time I do... I wish steam would put a neutral option. I really hope the devs produce something amazing with this, as I truely think they can... I just feel at this stage there isn't enough content to allow me to recommend it for more than an hour or 2."

,Not Recommended,555400,30687021,Posted: 23 March,all,Wardred,"I realize this game only released on Jan 7th 2017. Maybe I am doing something wrong. I have watched videos that are older than the relase date and it appears there was more content before release. It gives vauge missions... Explore a cave that has a dead end and nothing inside, then the objective doesn't go away. God forbid you run into a dinosaur, that is certian death it you don't have a place to escape to or get out of reach. I've seen guns in videos, but have yet to see any in game. What's the deal with not being able to find any gear, or equipment? When you start the game, you are given a task to explore the area and find out what happened. Is that the nearby area or the whole world? I have searched nearby and there is nothing to be found. Game discription says it has an intuitive crafting system. I have yet to discover any crafting in the game at all. I can't decide if this game is broken or the devs just making claims they can't support. I will have to wait and see what happens in the future. At this time, I can not recommend this game. It has a great look and concept. But you can't play a concept. If I don't see anything soon I may even ask for a refund. An update is needed and soon or this will just be another worthless early release Steam game. I am looking forward to Steam getting rid of the greenlight program to weed out unfinished broken games or lazy developers looking for a fast buck and drop the project.Final thoughts: Fingers crossed and hoping for the best. Don't let us down devs. This game could be one of the greats.EDIT: I want to continue my review of this as it looks likt it could be promising. I also didn't want to remove the previous just to allow others to see how the game progresses. A new update has been released as of 3/25/17. Crafting was added. Campfire that provides a  light source at night and the ability to cook, but makes it easier for human AI to find you and fends off the smaller dinos. There is also a shelter that you can craft that you can sleep to pass time. (Hope it can make the night go by faster.) You can store Items and any addition shelters built share the same storage. So putting an item in one will make it accesable in any additional shelters you build with plans to add fast travel to these shelters in the future. Sounds like the Devs are heading in the right direction. I will do a test of these new features and post my thoughts of the gameplay experience.Thoughts of the 3/25/2017 update: An hour of gameplay and couldn't build anything. resources impossible to find. Still certian death with a dino, unless you have a gun by killing a Human AI (which is only good for one use before it's got no charge). Then the crashing. Running from a T-Rex, crash. Walking, crash. Load into game, crash. Hiding behind a tree, crash. That's been my experience. Nothings changed. Still a dead end game. 100% Don't buy."
,Recommended,555400,34597249,Posted: 29 August,all,Dr. Modalot,"I haven't played much of this game so far, but I'm definitely interested in it! The landscape is beautiful, CryEngine definitely does this world justice. I like that the world isn't overpopulated with Dinosaurs. The first time I actually encountered a Rex was terrifying, and it pushed me to hide immediately even though I had the proper weapons to fight it. It's not a perfect world, though. I do have some small issues so far, but knowing that this game is still in early access, I imagine these will be smoothed out.- Make items stackable. As of the time I'm playing it right now, there aren't many things I can do with the resources I have, but I find stuff all over the ground that I want to keep. I don't have the capacity to carry every little thing I find, though. It would be nice if at least smaller items could be stacked up to a certain capacity, such as the energy cells and stimpaks.- Add more recipes. This will be expanded on, I imagine.- Vsync. As I was playing, I noticed in some areas that my game would start having screen tearing issues. If Vsync could be added, that would definitely help.- Waypoints. We have a map in game, so having waypoints or markers that we can add to help find new areas, or relocate previous ones would be useful.I'm sure I could say a lot more, but these are just some examples. Do I recommend the game though? Absolutely. Even if there isn't much to the game currently, it's the base of something that could be phenomenal. I just ask that the developers keep the survival ideas. Don't hold the players hand. Let them find things for themselves, let them be in a state of uncertainty. That's what I really liked about this game. I knew there were Dinosaurs, I knew there were droids. But stepping out of that pod into a quiet, open world was a very haunting experience."

76561198207673317,Recommended,555400,29128537,Posted: 8 January,all,snarkfactory,"Because this game is so early in development, this review is bound to change as the developers continue to work on it.Collision Course does not have much to offer at this stage. It is set in an expansive prehistoric world populated with hostile people and a variety of dinosaurs. The dinosaurs themselves are very well done. The models are outstanding, and the animations and AI work well as threats to the player. The environment is also done well, as it feels realistic and huge. Some areas feel like they are pulled right from an episode of Walking with Dinosaurs. The world is made more alive by the game's dynamic natural events. Meteor strikes and earthquakes happen at random. There are also human enemies in the world, which are alright. Unfortunately, there is not much to do in the game (yet). The only objectives are to survive and collect supplies. Although this has not happened to me, I can see how some people might get bored after a while. (There are, however, certain hidden secrets that you can search for. I won't spoil them here.)One of the game's best aspects is its potential. The developers have made it clear that this release is very bare-bones. The final product will have much more to do, including a developing storyline revolving around an impending asteroid impact. This is why I recommend Collision Course-the existing product is a great starting point for a fully fleshed-out game."

The atmosphere is great for building up tension and making you look over your shoulder, and I've jumped more than once from a raptor attacking me from a blind spot. The environment is really immersive and gorgeous as any game made in Cryengine ought to be. There's still a lot to be done to make it more than a walking simulator, but even in its current state its fun for a few rounds, preferably after a couple drinks."

,Recommended,555400,29122329,Posted: 8 January,all,Krush,"I really like this game. The world looks great and the dinosaurs as well.There is a lot to explore and some strange surprises I don't fully understand yet.So far I have found a gun, a crashed pod with some loot such as stim packs, energy cells and a steel bar as melee weapon. The encounters with AI have been scary and intense, especially when I ran into someRobot guy that was guarding the crashsite (Wasn't able to kill him so I ran away). In the jungle there where humans running around and one of them started shooting at me the second he saw me. But I was able to sneak up on some of them as well and punch them in the face to then take the loot they where carrying. When it comes to the dinosaurs I have to say that they are a highlight for me in this game. In my first few minutes of playing I had a Tyrannosaurus come at me and chase me through the jungle. It was so scary and since then I'm sneaking through the woods trying to avoid the dinosaurs as best as I can.There are view things that I want to point out as well though: I don't think that Collision Course is for everybody. It has a bunch of bugs and there is a lot of walking around and sneaking involved. People who are a bit inpatient or are looking for a game with non stop action could get bored after a while I guess. Another thing is that there is no real description of how to do things. After two hours of playing I found out how to use consumables and that you can punch crates you'll find in the world to loot them. Personally I like that the game doesn't tell you all the stuff you can or have to do but I have seen some videos of people who got annoyed by that (Items have descriptions when you hover over them with your mouse guys!).Overall I have to say that I'm having a really good time with Collision Course so far and that I'm going to play a lot more of it. It would be nice to have more items, weapons and stuff like that but looking at the roadmap the developers have posted I am convinced that they will work on that and eventually will make this a really awesome survival/adventure game."

There are games that are cheaper than this one that are terrible, yet this one is in CryEngine. Best $9.99 purchase for an early access game that I have ever found. Worth it, give it a shot.I've been following this game since I downloaded the ""Crynosaur Tech Demo 2.1"", and I was very intruged and hyped for this game. Even with my mid-grade PC and running the game on medium settings, the game is GORGEOUS! Sure, it is built with CryEngine, but holy cow this game is beautiful.When I booted the game up, I wandered for maybe 5 minutes enjoying the view, until I ran across an unexpected dinosaur that was not in the Tech Demo or in the update videos on their youtube channel, so it was an very plesant surprise to see a dinosaur I was not expecting. Then, after that, a few more minutes later, I ran into a Stegosaurus from the release date screenshot from their website, which was an awesome encounter, especially when I followed it too long and it got agitated with me, which was surprising. Already more dinosaur encounters than in The Hunter Primal. XDThen, something caught me completely off guard when I ran into what was either spores or toxic pollen, that I will not spoil, however, it was not only strange, but amazing.I am very excited to see where this game goes, and good job dev team!"

Hope the developer puts spinosaurus into the game and would like to see dinosaurs in groups and different sizes/skin colors and make the map a bit bigger.-PROS- beauitful forests/scenery-amazing dinosaur models, t rex looks pretty much like Rexy from JP-Scary. Unlike Ark where you run into a dino every sec, Once I finally ran into a T-rex, it made my heart race like hell lol(hide at night) it gets pretty dark and freaky-Love the weapons scattered all over the mapCONS-needs more dinosaur variety: Personally would add Spino, Brachiosaurs and would love to see a Titanoboa if possible, would add to some scary lake scenarios to it.-Map Needs to be bigger, and some places are bland in that they need to be filled with grass a bit more and vegetation.-More weaponsNeeds more caves for hiding at night or some bases to be hidden in to be safe.Overall game is AMAZING! Personally prefer it over Ark, that game ruins the suprise element because you run into a damn dinosaur every damn sec! Anyways The developer should definattly countinue this game, I can just picture what they final result will be if they keep at it! Dont abadoned this game like all the other amazing projects left behind! This will stand out if you keep at it! Love it!"

,Recommended,555400,30764312,Posted: 26 March,all,The Writing Rex,"This game, as early in development as is, is one of the better survival games out there. The immersion and challenges you're put through to survive is amazing. The Graphics are top notch, and the future ahead of this game is strong.Many have said this game is very bare-bones and boring, but I think otherwise. Try traveling all alone at night with a handgun and a flashlight and tell me how fearful you are, praying that something won't jumpscare you and end your life.I recommend this game to those who enjoy a small challenge of realism and immersion of survival.Please support these developers!"

At night a red flash keeps flashing across the screem, some lighting glitch I'm assuming. I'm walking around and randomly get teleported to a skeletol T-rex? No idea what that is but can't get out and die.  Was excited about this game and watched development, and dissapointed with everything so far."

This is not even close to complete, yet, and it is also said by the devs in the game info.If buggy, unfinished game doesn't bother you and you want to try a survival game with dinosaurs with huge potential to become to great dino-survival game, then I recommend to buy this.I have been following this project a year before steam release and I am quite sure that the devs will continuously develope this game.There isn't much content at the moment, but it is fun to play and explore already."

So many choices and at $8.50 I definately take more chances. But with this one I felt I had my moneys worth just bathing in the swamp and soaking in the atmosphere. For whatever reason I didn't expect an automatic weapon to cut me down first. looking forward to being eaten by a prehistoric beast now. lol... Good job and cool darn game already guys at Crynosaurs.
