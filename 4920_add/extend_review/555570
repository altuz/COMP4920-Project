76561198059679523,Not Recommended,555570,29864437,Posted: 11 February,all,Kael,"After playing the horrible, disgusting mess that was Romero's Aftermath, I knew I had to try this junk out. I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.This ""game"" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.You spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like ♥♥♥♥ing literally ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare ♥♥♥♥ing hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.I also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.It's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and ♥♥♥♥ed. That's what this game is."
,Not Recommended,555570,29412907,Posted: 21 January,all,cActUsjUiCe,Game is absolute garbage.  It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to ♥♥♥♥ you out of your stuff.*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle*Zombie AI is horrible.  They are ridiculously predictible and do not keep you on your toes at all.*Bullet drop needs to be reworked.  It isn't accurate at all.

I'm assumed this is why I was banned from Infestation Survivor stories too - I wouldn't know because the devs never answered me after I bought their turd and was randomly banned from it. Running forward is apparently cheating. In the 20 seconds of running forward I had in this game, it looked like just as big of a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥as Survivor Stories.

76561198071237562,Recommended,555570,30222028,Posted: 27 February,all,21 Salvaje,"Don't listen to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reviews, there are 3 categories to those people.1) They expect too much from a F2P 5 year old game2) They greatly exaggerate negative aspects of this game and mostly have no clue what they are talking about3) They suck at open world shooters, because boohoo I just started playing this game, don't know the map so I get shot running around in the open like a retard so the game must suck.You can have 5 characters and the respawn timer is only 3 minutes PER character, some retard wrote ""you have to wait forever to revive."" Forever = 3 minutes with 4 other characters on standby to play on, lol ok buddy. You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.Severs are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low.Performance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map.Player and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.In almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.The loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies.That being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.PvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.All in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends."

Can no longer use cars in regular servers for some reason.... ""dumb as ♥♥♥♥ by the way"" go to regular servers. Spawn in...... die to an incredibly suspicious sniper shot. Spawn back in with more gear to get your old gear, die by another guy sniping. spawn in on a different server to avoid the 5 man team spawn sniping.......die to a random guy spawn sniping. spawn back in try to get to the airforce base to kill super zombie. Make it there.  die to sniper camping the super zombie waiting for somebody to go kill it. try to join assult rifle only server, only 2 guys on it no pvp.  finally play long enough to get an abundance of snipers then turn into the guy spawn sniping. Process repeat until uninstall.The game went from super fun pvp and looting to literally not being able to move because all anyone does is camp with snipers, not run around or loot, but just sit with there 5 man team on top of a bridge with 5 snipers to get a couple kills every 20 minutes. Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it. I quit when they decided to make snipers even more abundant than they alredy were. which if you are reading this my story of the spawn snipers was before they added more so good luck now.10 out of 10 will die to kids spawn sniping."

Press play and long loading, press any tab and loading, create character and loading, search for servers and loading, enter in the server and long loadinnnnng. When I finally enter in the server I just live for 5 minutes and someone just shoot me for no reason and I died, and the game kick me out from the server to the main menu with a loading again and when revive the character guess what? Loading again. And after that if you try to play again starts all the loading fest again and after 5 10 minutos some random guy just kill you for no reason at all again. Every single thing you do, you have ""loading"". I can say at 90% of time I was looking to loading screens. When you finally enter, you get killed after 5 minutes or so. In ""beginner"" servers! I saw so many loadings even when I go to WC loading! If you like a ""loading simulator"" this is the right game for you. I play at max like 10 or 15 minutes. I try to play the game 3 times and I always died after 5 10 minutes. This game is frustration, not fun. The game is horrible in all ways.

This is a warning to all players:  Do not spend ANY MONEY on this game as they didn't take into consideration those that paid what happens when you lag out when you have a vehicle.  I am on Alienware 15 with a cabled connection and this game has disconnected me at least 3 dozen times.  (2) times I lost vehicles on the 100 player PVE server because of this including countless hours of play with the armor and weapons to find out another player loots it.I have also purposely LOWERED the resolution of this game to medium thinking it may help but to no avail.  The $5 is pretty much a burn donation meaning better to just spend it in a fireplace.Also, note that the PVE servers they provide is pretty much (1) for 100 players.  The rest are for those nice individuals that spend their money to provide the other users with at least a hope enjoyable experience.  Without that support, how could a game like this really support the paying users what they actually want?  Also, this game in some 'areas' does not allow you to purchase a server.  Ironically, when I 1st started, I was thinking of creating a server for others and my friends to enjoy as the other servers were either 10/10 or the (1) server 100/100.For those that have not experienced what I have been through, ask yourself why is it that you do not see OTHERS driving on the 100 player server...... very simply, you lag out, you lose your vehicle to another.  If you are lucky to get on a 10 player server, at least you have a chance to get it back IF YOU CAN GE BACK ONTO IT!To the programmers of this game.  Excellent graphics and artistic work.  Beyond that, without these exception issues (game crashing) and even recently the post about the new emergency update, its like selling a car without a steering wheel and tires.  What is the point?  Perhaps you should address the audience of people that have paid and ensure this doesn't happen.  A game like this with social media can make or break what this game could possibly be.Thank you for all your time.  The $5 is gone and so be it.  I do not want a refund but I do expect any company would have the compassion for those less fortunate to get them the customer service and expectations what any paying customer would ask for."

,Recommended,555570,30249849,Posted: 28 February,all,Trow,"Compared to the majority of previous...attemps at making this game what it could of been, I believe it has hit closest to home. Having beginner servers where it feels like the PvP is equally matched, as well as a place where new players can experience the overly done amount of loot is great, as when you hop on an official server that has high population, there's no doubt that you'll be popped in moments by a sniper depending on where you are (That's a downfall, but the majority of the time this can be avoided by just carefully selecting a server).The game mode 'Battle Royale' is great fun, but it feels like a heavy waste of time if you reach the top 10 and don't come in the top 3. I find that I reach the top 10 in a good amount of games, only to die before getting to the top 3 as people with heavy amounts of meds can sit in the radiation zone longer when the safezone circle is tiny, so they can easily pick you off.The PvP servers are good, if you have already gathered a mighty stash worth of guns that you really don't care about losing (A lot of game time till these servers become viable I believe).The warmup servers helpful as you don't lose your gear, but you do lose your consumables, so you need to bring a whole lot of meds & ammo for a gamemode where you achieve nothing but warming up.Overall, this type of game is still toxic, but a lot better than the previous ones and it does seem like it's heading in the right direction, there's bad parts, but good counter parts."

I have played this game since its alpha, and when it was called WarZ, so i downloaded it just to write this review.  Also, this is more of a warning as I have not played this ""New"" version yet.  so for the first year or 2 this was called WarZ.  No anticheat, glitches up the♥♥♥♥♥ lack of care from the development team.  After that there was a problem with strongholds.  A Castle like area you could build and collect some resources.  Many were Promised a month of access to it (its a pay to have kinda thing) depending what kind of alpha bundle you bought.  Now I havnt researched if other got this, but I didnt.  Never did in fact.  When I spent some of the free special money I had stored to buy this for a week, I was disapointed.   You were limited to what resources you could collect (which jsut helped you build walls and ladders and general stuff like that.) but also the farming you could do was limited (food and water wise, understandable on this one tho).  Than the name was changed because of the WarZ movie they made.  Thus it became Infestation Survival Stories.  Devs promised content and a working Anti Cheat system (before there wasnt even one).  Content was eh... and no Anti Cheat system ever stopped the hordes of hackers.  Their website was DDosd and was down for 2-4 days, and the reason is the people (who DDosd) thought the Head Developer was pocketing money and not caring for the game.  <- Interesting but I never researched on it.  Than I heard a group made this in a different name, but failed for the same reasons.  Now it is this, by a new team who bought the name.  Normally I beleive in second chances and playing the game to see if they bothered to fix it, but by now Id rather just spread the word of this games background.  Beware playing this game (or buying its special currency which im sure is still there).  If the new team does manage to bring back and fix it then well, god does indeed work in mysterious ways."

Sometimes these bugs very badly blur the screen and your ingame turns into rainbow colors or a ton of different all black shadows etc.. (I could list a few gfx bugs)Sounds: 8/10The gun sounds are really spot on infact its actually fun to play this game just to fire all the different guns,also when you land a nasty headshot from what feels like miles away the sound makes you want to shoot in your pants =)  but some sounds sucked :\ (see below)Soundtrack: 0/10 No effort into any sort of soundtrack what so ever these guys are only interested in a free to play with pay to play aspects of a  ZOMBIE SURIVIVAL MMO.(so they can get your money)Gameplay: 3/10 I would recommend giving the game a try if you're new to zombie mmo's and want to try your first one or a new one if youre exp'd in the zmmo scene,1.join a very low populated server2.loot and kill zombies3????4profit?My point is guys in this game there absolutely nothing exciting to do beside kill zombies hope to god you can stumbleupon a few nice weapons / bandges/redbandges/riot shield *seebelow* just to die to a hacker and lose this fine weapon.All the while you stupidly try to just loot and pve because im going to be very frank and a lot of hardcore fans of the game are going to hate me for it but thats just too bad because the facts are the facts and heres the list of things wrong with gameplay that as a constant player of the game you just cannot deny these things make this game not played on a major scale:1.Cheaters ....cheaters..cheaters.. and more YOU GUESSED IT ! CHEATINGYou cannot join a single server whatever it may be PVP or PVE/P  without 50% of the servers population cheating.(which is really sad because the game has some great potential for its realistic nature). The Recoil/Spread Factor/Damage Reduction/Shot Distance All make this game Really F$$$$$$$ bad@$$. Especially since if you're an admin looking for cheaters its practically a cake walk because no one is going to land 5 headshots in a row from 200+ meters so basically you eliminate a lot of ""legit"" cheating and no so legit cheaters.(all this falls under ADMINS/AC-TEAM Needing to do a better job.2. Group Cheaters/Single-Group CheatersGroup Cheaters are well exactly what it sounds like a group of 2-5*cheaters all playing together in a group this usually really only happens within the cheat community and the community members get together to cheat for fun against unsuspecting noobs. Single-Group Cheaters wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the gamebase wasn't filled with them.Almost every single 2 man group has 1 cheater leading the *legit* player to the enemies with his *walls/radar* and them using this advantage to the fullest by making those call outs the legit player can rambo his way through you and its GG.3. In Game Bugs/ Items/♥♥♥♥♥♥THAT HAS TO GO....Hackers  I know they are rampant So why does the AC/ADMIN team not get ♥♥♥♥in rid of them? SEE ABOVEThe anticheat does work but only to a certain extent i mean a handful of bans every couple of weeks isn't improving you guys.. in fact its making things worse  some of these cheaters/cheats are so simple that *I have downloaded cheats and tested them with only a few updates/tweaks.. to public source bots the cheats bypass the games AC* Now I won't go into detail but if you want to catch these cheaters stop looking for visuals give aways and start actually looking for memory hacks/etc... any cheat that has no visuals like silent aimbot/ triggerbot/ sound hacks etc.. are completely undetected by this AC and won't ever be detected because the AC team apparently doesn't care about the game im sorry if this seems like a rant but i love this game and wish the STAFF/CREATOR cared as much as i do....."

Starting out equipped with a flashlight and the cloths on your back it can be a hard road to survival with players lurking in every town ready to relieve you of them hard earned supplies. The new Z is a brutal world where spawn killing and ganking occur more surely than the sun rises on the morrow. Nothing says shoot me i'm the new guy like the fluorescent beacon you become when spawning in truth the game could do without this feature none the less it is not all doom and gloom.Being a primarily PVP orientated game Spawn times can get frustrating it pays to have a couple of characters making good use of their global inventory's which also helps with negating ganking a friend or two can't go astray. Unlike many reviews I find playing solo to be easier in some aspects as its not always the largest group who wins but the one who gets the jump first and its allot harder to spot one head bobbing through the scrub than six. The New Z is a challenging game which can be slow at times with action fuelled violence around the corner.If you lose patience quickly, don't like a challenge or get frustrated quickly this may not be the game for you. Its worth a try especially for free when your looking for something new in-between games I give Infestation: The New Z a 3 out of 5"

Although it's essentially just another WarZ (same engine, basically the same game coming from ""new developers"" supposedly. However, this one is much more optimized and seems to run smoother. There are quite a few issues with the game though, many you will notice shortly after you start playing.-Loot is too abundant, it's everywhere and spawns every minute or so... it's really insane and nothing seems to be worth picking up.-Appears to be pay-to-win (very likely that it is, but I'll need to play more)-Balance, mechanics, or hit detection are not good. It's one of those. It could also be the possible pay-to-win aspect. I found a guy, shot him around 10-15 times, bodyshots and headshots both (hitmarkers were showing), and he did not die. He threw down a shield, took out a golden sniper rifle and shot me once and I died. This is a major problem as he clearly should have died. This was also on a beginner server. I know one problem with previous games was instant healing and healing spam, but it's been patched multiple times in other games. I'm just not sure if this gamebreaking issue has been dealt with yet on this game.There are other issues as well. The game is free though, so I suggest trying it out, but I don't recommend it. It needs a lot of work. You must consider that the zombies are basically harmless and there's not much to do other than kill people. However, killing people does not work properly so there's essentially no point to this game. It's just an open world PVP game with zombies floating around.Wish they'd go back to Romero's Aftermath and fix that."

76561198009615803,Recommended,555570,29532286,Posted: 27 January,all,Jake Vegas,"I see this game has gotten many negative reviews,  and after 5 hours of gameplay, I'm not sure why.  So I've never played War Z or Infestation: Survival Stories, you have me there.  But I have played a very comparable game to Infestation: The New Z, called Day Z.  Both games feature a huge open world environment, looting, survival,  PvP, and Zombies.  I spent $30 on Day Z over 3 years ago when it was in it was still in the beginning  alpha stages of development.  I did not spend a dime on Infestation: The New Z and was able to try it at no risk.   3 years later Day Z is still in alpha development,  is still poorly optimized, and is still not enjoyable to me.  Infestation: The New Z runs smoothly on my PC, I find the graphics to be decent, so far my PvP experience has been enjoyable, and the zombies look and act much better than those in Day Z.  To me these 2 games are so much alike that the only substantial difference (besides the price) is that one takes place in Russia and the other in the United States.  That is fine; I'd prefer to play an American map anyway.For those who are interested in the zombie/survival/PvP genre, then I would suggest at least giving Infestation: The New Z a chance.  Why not?  Its free to play, unlike that other ridiculous excuse  of a game called Day Z, which sucked money out of our pockets has deliverd a overly lack lustre and unfinished product for close to 4 years now."

Although its a little buggy at times and crashes I still believe its one of the best free to play games out there. It has a good amount of customization and has a marketplace to buy supplies that you may need. It also offers some modes such as a pvp type mode. Infestation New Z also has a skill tree that you upgrade your survivor with. Overall this game is very fun and offers alot for a free game.

LOVE the little changes that they decided to implement to improve the feel of it. Only problem is I wish it was a little more like the old school WarZ when it comes to the amount of snipers. Also wish that they would have done a FULL wipe of every account when releasing the game to steam because there are players with a huge headstart (games been out for years.)

Then i started the game and realized that i got 16 FPS. I usually get 40-60 fps with CSGO, 60-80 with TF2, and 30 with Unturned(which i highly recommend over this piece of junk.) So optimization is really poor with this one.Also, there are a lot of microtransactions that make it very ""Pay to Win"". For example, i died while fighting zombies with 16 FPS, and had to wait 3 minutes for revival. But i can ofcourse PAY to be revived. Also, there are premium accounts."

76561198056047175,Not Recommended,555570,29532742,Posted: 27 January,all,oneloner,"In one word, this game is.... worthless.It took a mere 96 minutes to recognize (in the beginner 'safe' servers area mind you) that it has little to nothing to do with Zombies.  It is a PvP of camping players who wait for new players to arrive.  These new players (this will be you) 'think' the game is about gathering items for survival, avoiding or killing any zombies from which you cannot escape, and hoping you have enough bandages and food to stay alive. You are wrong in thinking you have the option of playing PVE or PVP.There's no need to worry about those bandages, food, weapons, or anything else.  The other players will simply wait to shoot you while you're trying to start and then take all of your gear, leaving you to start again.I started the game after character creation in a spawn spot in which I was shot upon entering the game (after an approx 5 sec safety wait).  That was experience one.Experience two got me a bit further as I came across an area where you could store additional gear (I hadn't found any yet) or buy other items with 'in-game' dollars which I hadn't found any way to make any yet (this is where the normal pay to play comes in... no complaints about that).It took another 35 minutes of walking/running towards a structure before I came across my first zombies.  Since I had found nothing thus far to use as a weapon it was hand to hand during which I eliminated 2 of the 3 zombies narrowly escaping the 3rd and being severely injured.  Came across some pain pills and that helped a little.Another 20 minutes in and I came across the first good spot for scavanging. Decent back packs but still no weapons armour, food, drink, or anything else. At least there were more zombies, which if I read everything correctly, is what the game is supposed to be about.Another 15 minutes and I get to a small town, Finally, a good amount of things to help. Three police cars with weapons, ammo laying about and not too many zombies.  I get geared up and then move to check out the the rest of the town.  With 2 zombies ahead I use a rifle to head shot the first... just to make sure I know the in game physics of the gun.  I switch to the baseball bat for zombie #2, move in swiftly, swing the first time knocking it back, and then I fall dead to the ground from the player who shot me in the back.Back to the starting screen you go, with a 3 minute delay before you can 'start' to respawn.  Once your character is fully alive you have another wait while the game loads again, you choose the server again, and it loads again! Finally you respawn and, of course, all of your gear is gone and you are starting all over.Worthless.... utterly worthless.  Do not be fooled or mislead by this title.  It is a PvP game through and through.  There are no options to PvE (when you search for PvE servers only you get an empty list).This game WILL suit you, however, if you want to invest in 'pay to play' up front (risking losing gear you buy), or if you want to grind against the game inhabitants (zombies when you can find them) or other players intent on simply taking advantage so they can increase the in-game ""kill streak"" messages.For me, the most enjoyable thing about this game... was unloading it!"

Here is my honest review of the game so far.ProsIt's Free to Play & Also enjoyable at the same time.The combat is nice and the PVE is many many months of fun & I'm still doing it.It has TRADING SERVERS!!! like common how dank is that.The devs are up to date on all the latest exploits & glitches.The anti cheat is one of the best I have ever seen, They come on the server with hacks and usually get banned instantly if not when the game gets launched.ConsIt crashes a lot, But honestly what's there to expect for a game that is Free to Play and is not getting much funding.Game is a tad laggy in city areas but can be worked around with ease.Most of the items in the game are fairly expensive & people who don't own private servers I can see that being a issue."

READ FULL REVIEW OR SKIP TO PROS AND CONS AT THE BOTTOMLet's cut to the chase, most people who say it's a bad game either A) Suck at anything survival related. B) Got spawn camped, which isn't very common C) Want more content out of a FREE GAMESo into the review:This is a free game. You do not have to do anything except download and sign up, that's already a good deal considering all of the content this game has. Sure, there are better PAYED game (none that I know of however) but that doesn't make it a bad game. It is a massive (but not too big) map with a few towns and massive main towns with tons of pvp. The global inventory system makes it easy to log out and store your good gear. I recommend storing many inventories full of gear that way when you die it really isn't a big deal because you can just load in with another full equiped player. Most of the reward from this games comes from the pvp. Once you and a friend or a few friends can own an entire town and be the only ones to collect the loot in it, you pretty much feel like complete badasses. I myself have a group of 5 and we all understand the bad reviews, however you guys are acting like you payed money to play and given that it is FREE I would easily rate this game 8/10 in every aspect. I have played a few of the payed games such as DayZ, WarZ, etc. and none of them are nearly as fun. The party system has to be my favorite aspect. Not only is it made very clear where your teamates are, but you can't hurt them with guns (however explosives can). Another very rewarding and fun aspect of this game is hunting down the skin crates. There are normal skin crates that you can find and premium skin crates. I have so far collected 4 or 5 skins and every time I find a new crate I get excited. Sadly, if you pick up a crate and do not open it and then activate the skin, YOU CAN LOSE THE CRATE TO A PLAYER WHO KILLS YOU. Also, you MUST open the crate in-game. Luckily it doesn't take long to open it and activate the skin. (However I did have a friend lose a premium crate because he was going to trade it to me and some a**hole killed him and I haha, but that's half the fun). Overall I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants an awesome FTP Zombie Survival game. Oh, and did I mention theres a skill tree from gaining XP and a global shop to buy ammo? Yeah, that's cool too.Pros:-FREE-Global Inventory-Great Party System-Massive but not too massive map-Marketplace-Skins-Skill Tree-RUNS EXTREMELY WELL (Other than crashing sometimes)Cons:-Nobody Is Friendly, but that makes it more fun for me-Will Crash Every Now And Then"

Различные режимы,BattleRoyale,PVP?PVE,режимКрепость. Вообщем можно выбрать режим под себя.7-Античит.Каждый час на серверах банится от 2-10 человек. MLG ANTICHEATS-в данный момент лучше чем античит VAC от VALVE.Это весьма радует.8-Инвенты.Это очень радует.Инвенты происходят чаще, чем VALVE выпускает кейсы (а кейсы они штопают частенько).Чего стоят супер зомби.9-Комюнити.Это когда русских на серверах так мало ,что приходится радоваться каждому русскому игроку на сервере.Минусы:1-Однообразие.Который раз разработчики перезапускают эту серию игры?Они просто мусолят эту игру не делая ее лучше.(Но это не точно).2-Оптимизация.Постоянные вылеты,нестабильное соединие с серверами,плохая оптимизация всей игры,так же иногда происходят странные вещи(Если можете то посмотрите несколько скриншотов у меня).3-Графика.Ну можно было приподнять графон.А понимаю что в данной игре это не особо нужно,но всё таки где картинка лучше?Максималки или минималки?Ответ очивиден.4-Бег.ПОЧЕМУ ТАК МЕДЛЕННО ПЕРСОНАЖ БЕГАЕТ,ГОСПОДИ ЗА ЧТО!!В общем плюсов больше,но и остонавливаться на достигнутом разработчикам не стоит.Есть многое что нужно доработать,добавить,пофиксить.Единственное  пока что мне нравится это античит.Он банит постоянно!И причём очень часто!В общем несмотря на плохие отзывы,я могу порекамендовать данную игру,да есть минусы,да они может и очень усугубляют её.Но запомните!ПОДЪЕХАЛ В ЛОКАЦИИ И ЗАБИРАЙ МАШИНУ,ИНАЧЕ ПРОЕБЁТЕ ЛИБО 150К,250К ИЛИ 500К!EnglishYou know what is optimization? Yes ? And I'm not. This game being in the category of ""Free"" has its pros and cons.Perhaps I'll start with the pros:1 - donut does not solve anything.2-Top loot you can collect in a couple of hours of the game.3-the Huge amount of loot,variety of weapons4-Skins.This weenie the game does not spoil,but I think it would be better to cons.And the skins just pleasing to the eye.But also to buy their junk.Can be run at locations and salutati cases with skins.5-Machine.In this game there is transport.Though few (1-3)PCs. can you help them save time,nerves and so on.6-Raznoobrazie . Different modes BattleRoyale,PVP?PVEmode Fortress. Generally, you can choose the mode for yourself.7-anti-Cheat.Every hour the servers will be banned from 2-10 people. MLG ANTICHEATS-at the moment better than VALVE's VAC anti-cheat.It is very happy.8-Leave.It is very pleasing.The leave happen more often than VALVE releases the case (and the cases they darn often).What are the super zombies.9-Komyuniti.This is when the Russian servers are so few ,that we have to enjoy every Russian player on the server.Cons:1-Monotony.Once again the developers restart this series of games?They just procrastinate, this game is not making it better.(But not sure).2-Optimization.Constant crashes,unstable coedine servers,poor optimization of the game,so sometimes strange things happen(If you can view a few screenshots I have).3-Graphics.Well, you can lift the graphics.But understand that this game is not really need,but still where is the picture better?Maximum speed or minimum payout?Response ochividen.4-Run.WHY SO SLOW THE CHARACTER RUNS,LORD FOR THAT!!In General there are more pluses but also to ostanavlivatsya on our laurels developers is not necessary.There are many things that you need to modify,add,fix.The only thing I like is cheat.He bans all the time!And very often!In General, despite the bad reviews,I can porekomendovat this game,Yes there are downsides,but they can really aggravate it.But remember!DROVE TO LOCATIONS AND TAKE THE CAR,OTHERWISE YOU'LL ♥♥♥♥ UP OR 150K,250K OR 500K!Comments: 1"

If you are a begginer at this game you CAN NOT get good items. In every good zone(like Clearwater) there are freaking Snipers. I understand the weapon and that people use it, but c'mon. Not every city.WHY ARE THERE SO FEW SERVERS? ~ 20 servers for begginers? There are kinda lots of player on this game, most of them starters, not veterans. Also most players play on begginer servers. Without lots of servers, the ones there would be almost full... I mean it's a lot. You can't really find a server with < 30 players. And that is a lot. Even for a big map. Most would just camp in cities so RIP cities.Last but not least, please tell me, WHY IN THE ACTUAL MOTHER OF CHRIST IS THERE A RULE WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN BEGGINER IF YOU DON'T HAVE x+ HOURS?TL:DR; It's a good game with lots of potential, even good right now, but not the best. I give it a 7/10, but will gladly up that if more servers were added/the hour rule was removed/connection bugs were solved.Edit 1: The game was updated a while ago. The disconnecting bug was finally solved. 8/10 for now; if they solved the servers problem and host more servers it'll be a definite 10/10. Above Average Game."

Let me start by saying this game isnt perfect, nonetheless it is worth downloading, who doesnt want a free game that anyone can download and play with their friends.  now for the bad part of this game, this game does tend to either kick you out every once in a while, and crash randomly, also this game has devs that dont really solve the problem.  this game had great potential but after downloading it and playing at least an hour it is a very fun game if you know how to play.  I think most people who write negative reviews honestly suck at the game, just like in real life they tend to blame any blemishes of this game but fail to realize that this game is not a simulation.  People try to compare this to day z and h1z1, the game is far from it.  So if your interested in downloading this game i suggest you download it with an open mind and not try to compare and contrast to other games.A few pointers to people who just started and who are currently having trouble having a good time, i suggest you start in a server with less people.  The fewer people the better, only because you can get loot and only have to worry about zombies, also i suggest you do scavenge citys and log out, this game is bogus and lets you exit the game with all of your loot and be able to store it so when you get back on you can loot the same city and repeat the process soon you will have so much loot in your inventory that it wont matter if your character dies."

Crawling and crouch walking can sound just as loud as running.Jumping over things can be tricky. Rocks and fences can become pretty serious obstacles at times.It can become a walking simulator between towns.Guns can be unwieldy when it comes to accuracy at a distance with snipers seeming to be the only true skill shot.The game can bug out and lock you out from playing. I had to wait a while to restart after a death because the game thought an attempt to join a server worked. It did not though and I was locked out until I assume my account timed out and logged off.Neutral:Spawns don't hold your hand for long. After a short time of ""spawn protection"" any player who sees you can hurt you.The spawns seem to be a random place near to where you last died. If you were in a hot zone then you might not get far, but I had no trouble leaving the area if I choose to.This game is definitely leaning towards the PVP aspects. If you want a ""day z like"" game, but with plenty of loot to fuel the battle, then this game is a very good deal at the price of free. Yes they lock content such as cars behind private servers, or premium servers. That doesn't make the rest of whats on offer unplayable in any way.I liked this better than the ARMA 2 mod day z in my time with them. You can stick close to hot zones and quickly get geared up after a death thanks to the surplus of loot. Slinking around a town at night with NVG on while hunting other players is a blast.Infestation: The New Z does its job without many glaring bugs that will make you feel like you wasted time. The most glaring for me was being locked out from joining servers for a while. The rest of the looting and combat was pretty well polished."

,Recommended,555570,29467103,Posted: 24 January,all,BionisGuy,"I actually downloaded this game earlier today because some friends were playing it. I was a bit skeptical at first because i played it when it was ISS.Honestly the game back then kinda sucked, you had to farm for 2 weeks for one pistol, the respawn rate on items was really bad and the overall combat just sucked, your normal fists did no damage to Zombies so it was a pain to survive.But now actually, it feels a bit better. It sure is the same old kind of mechanics that ISS used, but the spawn rate on items is doubled it feels.Your character isn't dead for like 1 hour before you can respawn with him (iirc it was like 1 hour downtime in ISS so if you got spawncamped on all 5 of your chars the game just sucked)As stated earlier item spawn is changed, so it's easier to find weapons to use and the PVP is actually quite fun in it.The only downside with the game is that the map is a bit too big and traveling take a long time, so if either the travel time on foot gets increased or the map becomes a bit smaller it would be even better.The shop is better now aswell, iirc you could actually buy weapons in the ingame shop for real cash which was just weird for a survival game, now it's only basic stuff like ammo, Melee weapons (that you can buy for ingame money that can be gained from killing Zombies).Honestly, the game is pretty good for being a F2P title, i definitely recommend atleast trying it out for a bit, it's a fun time killer actually.There is also a Battle Royale mode like H1Z1 got, i haven't played it enough to be able to give you an input on that yet, i have mostly been playing the normal survival mode.OverallGraphics: Let's be honest, they're quite bad, the game looks ""ok"" but that's it so a 5/10Combat: the game is responsive, it's not clunky like any other games feel, so every mouseinput is instant instead of the feeling of clunkiness with the mouse, so it's good 8/10Audio: really good actually, you can hear from which direction someone is shooting or from where someone is running if running on some kind of metal, 9/10Try the game, it's quite good for what it is."

Never played the previous iterations, and some zombie survival did sound like fun. Well, I was wrong... But its only my opinion, and since its F2P, testing it wont cost you a lot.Lets see what I disliked.Graphics. You have two options usually. Either you go for top notch (Crysis style) or you have a solid artistic direction that balances the lackluster engine (like Borderlands). ""But its F2P and meant to run on a vast array of machines"". Yeah. Its still looking awful, even on ultra settings. I mean 1999 awful. Environments (especially trees) look awful, zombies look awful.Sound. Its weird. They tried to make use of sound to enhance the gameplay. And it just feels totally artificial. And the zombie's groans... OMG... Sounds like they used windows recorder with a poor mic and recorded the hangover sounds of an after party...Music. Dull, bland.Gameplay. Well... It's crap. I mean... Only silent walk you have is while standing up? Yup. No lean. No sensation when firing or using melee. And its basically spawn, try to get to ressources, get shot by some camper. Yay. Add to that a very crappy UI (you get a party request, you'd expect some way to accept it easily, no? Well, no, you have to open the list of present player, find the one who invited you thanks to a little symbol, and then you can accept...wth...).Well...

It's♥♥♥♥♥♥  You'll get into it just enough to get hooked and then it becomes garbage after 3 days , here's why.  TL;DR is at the bottom.PVP:--------Played it with 3 other friends , one of them passed the 72 hour mark which means you can't access beginner servers anymore. Why is this such a problem you wonder? First of all , game devs didn't think this idea through at all,it's ridiculous . It's very stupid to assume that a player with 0 hours played and say 70 hours played should fall into the same category. You can access the official servers after 1 hour played I think. The official servers are absolute garbage. Not only are they WAY less populated than beginner servers , they game also loses its meaning. It is no longer an open world pvp. Instead , it's just a server with a chat filled with people spamming ""where's pvp?"" when it should be everywhere ,right? But half the server population camps in the pvp hotzones ( major cities ) so they would reply with ""Campos"" or any other city,  and the other half are in the remaining good farming spots , and only a handfull of people doing actual open world pvp. This made us wander around the map for HOURS before we could find even a single player!  In contrast , today I was 10 minutes in a beginner server and encountered a car , a player in one town , two players in another town , and heard gunshots in a larger town.  On official? Not a single soul.  The problem is that people get items on beginner servers so they don't even need to roam around on official , they can just go into major cities and shoot each other.PVE:------Practically  non-existing.  The zombies are absolutely no challenge whatsoever. Pvp aside , they are actually just a minor nuisance in the way of your looting. The only thing even remotely challenging is the super zombie , but even he can be easily countered by just jumping on a few boxed and he can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥.. And devs have the nerve to call the game the best Zombie MMO..Game modes:----------This is one of the few redeeming qualities this game has , if offers a lot of modes to suit your gameplay and much more to come.Game in general:----------------Crashes every now and then , also kicks you out of servers a lot , it's frustrating.>>>>>>>>>TL;DR<<<<<<<<<<Major problems:-------------------> What's the point of cars if I can only use it on beginner servers? I barely collect enough money to buy it.> Snipers are way too easy to find and are superior to any weapon> Riot shields are abused> Third person view gives too much advantage> Pvp consists of constantly jumping around , placing riot shields and quickscoping. It's awful.> Pve is absurdly easy , not a challenge.> Too many hackers> Game too unstableCONCLUSION:  It's fun at the start , it has its good aspects but the bad parts dwarf all the good in it. It gets boring very fast + all of the above made me dislike the game a lotFOR DEVS:If the game devs really care about the game , they would have read this far and hear me out on what could improve the health of the game greatly.> Limit riot shields ( ex. 1 per person at a given time )> Remove some servers so people are forced to fill up the remaining ones ( Game will be richer with players )> Make it an open world pvp again. Make a map with no major cities , no hotspots , just evenly distributed towns across the map.> Make beginner servers ONLY for beginners , ex. 0 - 5 hours played , after that you have official servers , this will force people to roam the map> Make zombies more challenging , unpredictable , and a bigger threat."

This game brings a gameplay feeling like no other game, I've been around since alhpa version of it's first release from the former developers. I must say this is absolutly a addticing game. Yes, like many other game it has problems, bugs, crashes, cheaters, etc. Cheaters was the wrost problem during the first versions which has been improved since new anticheat systems but the crashes and bugs are still many. If these problems are eliminated I think this is the most intense and high value gametime game there is on the f2p market of the firstpersonshooter survivalgames. I am hooked since day one and I still get adrenaline rushes from a intense pvp fight where you come out the winner because you out smart your enemies.Some balance and tweaks are needed to fulfill everyones needs but overall playing this game with a couple of friends has the moste awesome game experience there is.As a community and a close conversation with the developers this game can only grow and become better."

,Not Recommended,555570,29604389,Posted: 31 January,all,[ACME]Johnny2Guns,"This is great fun if you're looking for a PvP focused open world with zombies sprinkled in.The food/water aspect of the game is only to deter campers as it is easy to forget about it when food spawns everywhere.Speaking of spawns, loot in general is everywhere, Guns/Armor/Food/Skins are everywhere you'll never want as long as you make it into the Town/Airport/Fort you spawn outside of.Here is when it starts getting negative, chances are you'll spawn outside the same Town over, and over, And Over, AND OVER. I've played this game for 6hrs and have only ever spawned outside the airport and ski lodge.Map Size: when you open up the map it really looks big, with points of intrest scattered all over. But, you'll soon find out that everywhere in between is Literally just plain hills and rocks which wouldnt be so bad if they didnt make you run as fast as a snail to make the map 'feel' bigger. you can tell as soon as you hop on that your character was ment to run faster as his feet are just a tad bit to fast for the speed you're moving. Maybe its because they introduced cars that i have no idea how to obtain other than buying them.Close quarters gunplay is decent if not generic for a TPS/FPS and can be slightly improved if your gun switched sides when you switch cameras in third person view.Medium to long range gunplay however is a poopshow, i swear bullets come out of your gun sideways, one of the 3 characters you'll be able to choose is an ex-military type. are you telling me he can't zero his gunsight to actually be able to hit what his scope is aiming at?! the cone of fire is insane even after you upgrade your skilltree. ugh its so annoying to have your crosshair over someones head and watch your tracer fly by a couple of feet to his right and then adjust only for it to fly miles to the left. your best bet is to spam with your sight on center of mass as they bunnyhop behind a tree/firestation. long story medium, gunplay at range is Poopy.P.S all bullets are tracers so anyone that is even slighty aware will know where you are as soon as you fire, maybe give us an option to change the tracer order in the menu. like if - = tracer and ' =  bullet. we can have options that go -'''- or ''''-Ping/fps feels decent enough it only dips when you join a battle royale server on warm-up and 80 people are on screen shooting your♥♥♥♥♥off. and if we can have a 10 to 15 second delay after battle royale actually starts so we can get our bearings and let the game catch up with its self that would be cool. (that might actually already be a thing but it takes forever for me to load in so i never notice)Lastly the only problem that is truly a game breaker is that the game breaks, alot . . . you have 15-20 minutes on a 'really' lucky session until it crashes. i have two thoughts on this.One) is that the devs are incompentent and cannot prevent/fix it from crashing even after YEARS of game development and the crashes will probably never get fixed. "" WarZ, Infestation: Survivor stories, George Romero's AfterMath""Two) the Devs are actually russian spys sent to terrorize the american populus by making a halfway decent yet addicting game/s so we will keep playing through crashes after crashes until we finally agree to send them our bug report that is filled with our american secrets and nudie pictures caught on our webcams and permission is hiddin deep within the terms and conditions.With the Devs' track record it could be Either Or.TL;DR  I would give this game a Mixed, leaning on No until they fix the crashes."

When not crashing you just get disconnected from the server very often and every time i have gone to the trading servers ive crashed within a minute, also had my ZK spawner stolen from me on a PVE server IN a safe zone, it does not tell you its possible to be taken by other people when spawned in any way but even if it is supposed to be possible it shouldnt be on a PVE server or in a safe zone let alone BOTH.This game has HORRIBLE customer service and has absolutly no interest in helping people with a complaint, i have no respect for a company that does not care about the people keeping them in business and will never play a game by them ever again"
