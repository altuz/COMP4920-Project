,Not Recommended,555620,28646936,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Noedel-Man,"Fun game for a while. But there are only two maps and one game mode. You will be played out very fast. The game feels like a early acces game, because of the lag of content and the odd camera- movement system. The gameplay you see in the trailer is all there is to it. Nothing more and nothing less."
,Not Recommended,555620,32672318,Posted: 23 June,all,Da Atte,"Gore and excitement! ...For youngsters.Crazy Oafish Ultra Blocks: Big Saleis... something else. When I saw the screenshots I thought the game was going to be an over the top version of POSTAL or Paint the Town Red. Unfortunately Crazy Oafish Ultra Blocks: Big Sale was nothing like that. It tried to be offensive, edgy and politically incorrect and naughty but fails in all of those aspects.Crazy Oafish Ultra Blocks: Big Sale is a game where your objective is to buy certain items on your shopping list. The problem is that you will need money for the purchases and the only way to obtain them is to collect money wither from the ground or by killing other shoppers. The idea of the game is fun but the execution is bad. When you have completed a couple of round you will notice you've ran out of content already. There are two maps and only a handful of weapons. A game like this begs for more content and right now Crazy Oafish Ultra Blocks: Big Sale feels more like an Early Access title than a completed game.But the gameplay isn't really the only issue I have with the game. Like I mentioned earlier there game tries to be offensive. There are a couple of genuinely funny advertisements scattered around the mall but after that the humor falls flat. The humor feels like that special kind of humor that works on 12-year olds. I'm not mocking younger people right now but for an older person the game doesn't really offer anything. More than anything the humor is non-existent and confusing... Somebody making the game thought some of the things inside the game were mandatory for the experience? The humor is mostly awkward cube sex and strange advertisements. And trust me. There's a lot of cube sex.I can't really recommend this game because it's not even good ironically. It is something I can't explain. It's a game that has some thought put into it but was half-heartedly ""finished"" and put on to Steam Store. It's fun for a couple of minutes but the gameplay and shock factor wear off in just a few minutes."
,Not Recommended,555620,33445232,Posted: 10 July,all,Captain Rusty,"Meme game by Russian RedditorsPROS-I was actually pleased with the graphics and animation. Simple, but fine. It's an aesthetic that really works for a dev team that can't afford a real artist. I like it here and in Paint The Town Red. This game also has a good variety of characters populating the world.-Though humor is a con below, I thought the collectible Playboys with blocky♥♥♥♥♥♥was sort of funny. Sort of.CONS-The default top-down camera option sucks and doesn't even let you see half the store names. You can change it to third person, but it never sticks and you'll have to do it every time you start the game.-The controls are terrible. The game is about attacking and shooting, but you can only attack right in front of you. So instead of using the mouse to aim, you have to point yourself at your target. This might be fine if not for my next point.-In a game pretty much all about wreaking havoc, they sure make that a difficult, unpleasant experience. It's sort of fun to blow one person to bits with a shotgun, but when the whole room starts to chase you, it's not fun anymore. You'll empty your gun missing every shot, then get mobbed to death and start over (or refund the game if you know what's good for you).-The sound is just bad. The developers did take pity on you and mute all sound by default, but if you go against their will and turn it on, it's just annoying music and a stock ""bustling crowd"" sound. That could work for the mall setting, but the thing is the only sound effects in the game are the guns and there's only one music track. It gets grating fast.-The coding is really, really bad. I'm not sure what engine this is made in, but I'm assuming it was made by the devs because it's godawful. If you turn on infinite ammo to make the game SOMEWHAT fun and start killing everyone, the game will very quickly slow to a crawl with a lot of bodies on-screen. For some reason, your walking is broken when this happens, and you start to slide to the side while running. It's very strange.-The humor is low-effort and completely unfunny. Gabe Newell and other EPIC Valve PC Master Race references, Gangnam Style button (seriously), generic sex humor. It's just dull and makes me roll my eyes.-Very little content. Two small maps with pointless goals and no fun mechanics to play with.I gathered all of that from playing for only twenty minutes. Twenty minutes and you've seen everything there is to see, and it's nothing good. If this was released five years ago by a one-man dev team for free I might have considered it endearing. But it's none of those things. This thing came out last year, it's got a sizable dev team, and it cost me a dollar. I could believe this was some kind of laundering scheme.This game did not deserve the effort spent reviewing it, and I'm not sure what compelled me. I guess because the price, the screenshots, and the positive reviews (seriously guys what the ♥♥♥♥) made me curious enough to sink a dollar in and I want to warn you that it's just not worth it. You might get one laugh out of the bugs. That's it."

Not even the gameplay is interesting or works in any way, if I can't figure out how to pick up a key item in your game while mashing every button then it's garbage.Unless a random funni xd sex joke is your idea of fun, then skip this trash."
