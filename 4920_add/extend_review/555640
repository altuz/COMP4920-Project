,Recommended,555640,31266703,Posted: 20 April,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"I liked this visual novel quite a lot, but I wish it was longer. Basically, it’s about Brian, an American student living in Japan and we follow him as he learns more about the culture and makes new friends.The glossary during the dialogues was useful, and both main heroines are cute and interesting. I understand that the game was made for a certain audience, but I get this feeling that they lost a chance to make it more “educational”. It goes from an interesting subject to fan service pretty fast in a few scenes, and that bothered me a bit. Also, there’s the endings;It’s basically the same for both girls, and they just changed a few lines.7/10. I liked the concept, the art style is really pretty, the songs are catchy. But as I already said, I think they could’ve done a bit more here. Also, the story gets fast at some point, one day you’re celebrating Halloween, and then suddenly it’s Christmas and it goes on. I recommend getting this title on a sale if you want a light story to read."

One moment it will be talking about anime and then the next it will be talking about the culture of Japan.I would not recommend this game at all, it honestly felt like a waste of time and did not cover much aspect of Japanese school life instead it feels like a Wikipedia that has been glossed over with a story."
,Recommended,555640,30639496,Posted: 20 March,all,DragYn,"Japanese School Life (JSL) is a slice-of-life about a US exchange student named Brian studying in Japan for a year.  While there, he meets 2 similar-yet-different girls in his class.  Hilarity ensues.  Okay, not so much hilarity, but rather . . . . education.  Information.  Learning.  Man, I'm making this sound boring.  Hang on a sec here . . . let me try this again.Are you interested in Japanese culture?  Do you want to know minute details about Japanese foods, festivals, holidays and such?  Then JSL is for YOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!This VN is definitely slice-of-life. I guess. Mostly.  Well, maybe it's more educational.  But life happens in it.  A whole school year, actually.  You arrive in Japan and are immediately befriended by 2 adorable girls (Chiyoko and Arisa) who take you under their wings.  Throughout the course of the year, you'll learn minor details about each and be treated to glimpses of their personalities.  Unfortunately, that's about as deep as they get.  You see, that's pretty much the ""story"" here in JSL.  You meet these 2 girls, pick one to romance (sort of) and stay stuck in the friend-zone for an entire year anyways.  A very large chunk of the game is actually informational miniature ""lectures"" from the girls about various aspects of Japanese (and specifically otaku) culture.  I'll be honest, I learned a LOT in this VN.  But was it entertaining? Eh . . .Graphically, the sprites and CGs are beautiful.  The game utilizes the Emote system (which anyone who's read my other reviews knows I enjoy) to make the characters more lively through animation.  The voice overs (in Japanese) are much more professional than in many games, and the characters themselves have many and varied reactions, inflections and tones in their words.  The music is decent and catchy, and had me humming a couple of the ""happier"" tunes after I'd close the game.In the negative, the story is bland and forgettable.  The game feels mostly like a delivery tool for a culture lesson.  This is all well and good, but I would have rather had more actual story content (The entire game took me less than 6 horus for 2 routes) to better balance out the exposition you recieve about things like ""mochi"".Also, Brian.  Ugh.  Why so many exclamation points, Brian?! How are you possibly this excited about almost everything that happens to you on a daily basis?! He uses them in every. Single. Screen. Let's be honest, Brian is a dork. He may be a lovable dork, but he's a dork none-the-less.  I mean, it took him an entire year of having these cute girls covertly throwing themselves at him to even realize he LIKES one of them, andSTILL HE DOESN'T DO A DAMN THING ABOUT IT.  HE GOES HOME SINGLE! AARRRRGGGHHHHH!Despite the negatives, I believe the positives outweight them and I definitely lean more to recommending the game than not.  It's silly, it's funny (sometimes), it's long-winded (like me) and cute simultaneously.  As with many of these more modestly-priced VNs, I'd say wait and get it on a sale.  50% feels like you're getting your money's worth for sure.  I bought it at 25% off, and that seems almost a bit high to me."

76561198346650633,Recommended,555640,30324691,Posted: 4 March,all,JupiterInc,"Honestly, this was one of the first visual novels I played and it still has a place in my heart. There is no bad endings, and it somehow keeps it to a level where you are satisified witht the outcome. Now, is there a lot of choices, no It's more reading and is mainly just standing back and letting the story unfold. It has Japanese audio and the english subtitles are overall nice with little to no mistakes. At times they will talk about certain items, events, places, or time periods, and simply by clicking on the word you learn what is and how it may be used.Pros:-Good voice actors-Good development of story (although no real set goal per say)-Defines alien words-Gives explanation for things in Japan-Main Girl Characters  are well designed, animated, and are just so lovable-You can really feel as though the team who created the game put their heart and soul into thisCons-No real goal in mind of story-Mainly just reading if your not that intersted in reading that much-Little choices for a route (I think there is like times you have to make a choice)-You just get so damn jealous of Brian the MCI would totally recommend this game to my friends or anyone who enjoys lovable characters and a good story! In fact I've already recommended this story to about 5 or 6 different people. I give it a rating of 10/10. If this helped you then great, if it didn't im sorry I couldn't give you a good enough review! (;_;)."

It was really that hard a choose name command it somehow breaks the experience makes you watch as a outsider rather than a person who lives the storylittle, almost none chose options, only a few choices save the game from being a kinetic novel making the player being carried by Brian´s...unique personality.as conclusion this game is good with a good story,good characters, and good visuals, is maybe...a little expensive for a demi-kinetic novel however if you like otaku culture or Japan you will enjoy this game, if you wanna play a visual novel...well"
,Recommended,555640,32792524,Posted: 25 June,all,CB007,"So did 2 girls teaching you about Japan become a sub-genre at some point? I feel like I've been here a few times before.Anyway, this game is cute and teaches you a little bit of trivia about foods, places and customs but not much about the school life in the title. The story is about 75% cute fluff and 25% educational. It also paints a view so positive that it feels somewhat ingenuine.The art and animations are quite good, but the two main characters are the only ones we get to see and interact with.There are 2 routes and endings, but there are only a handful of lines that are different between them, and the ending is the same either way- no feeling confessed and it all feels kind of unresolved for this type of game.Not a terrible way to spend a few hours and I got this at a good sale price so I'm going with the thumbs up."

76561198069159152,Recommended,555640,30406182,Posted: 9 March,all,wrb41977,"A rather interesting and funny little visual novel, this one centers around an American exchange student studying in Japan for a year. The first students he meets are Chiyoko and Arisa, two girls who befriend him and proceed to show and tell him about many facets of Japan and Japanese culture. In the end, you can choose to start down the path of becoming a bit more than just a friend with one of the two (there is no love confession, just... an awareness that the protagonist feels something for them).All in all, a good buy. Though it also can be a bit time-consuming considering how the scene partissons work."
,Recommended,555640,28992329,Posted: 3 January,all,sndPhoenix,"Short review:Japanese School Life is a cute, fun distraction and surprisingly informative. Buy it if you're interested in learning about detailed aspects of Japanese culture and daily life that you won't find in many other games.Long review:Japanese School Life is — shockingly! — a visual novel focusing on the Japanese school life of an exchange student arriving from a foreign country. Using this central conceipt, the game explains various aspects of daily life as seen from the perspective of a student in Japan, in a style that is half entertainment, half cultural guidebook.As a concept, the game is executed well. It includes detailed descriptions about Japanese culture and lifestyle that are not necessarily apparent even to people who have played many Japanese VNs or experienced other forms of Japanese media like anime and manga. The art is good, the characters are fun and well-voiced, and the music is non-intrusive. The quality of the English writing is exceptionally high for a VN voiced in Japanese.Japanese School Life is very similar to Tokyo School Life and Go! Go! Nippon! and as such it's hard not to compare the three. All are high quality and enjoyable. Japanese School Life lacks a bit in length and depth when compared to Tokyo School Life, and is a bit less organized as a guidebook than Go! Go! Nippon! However, Japanese School Life combines some of both worlds and is clearly intended to be a simple, relaxing experience, something at which it succeeds. If you're searching for maximum value, pick it up on sale, but I didn't feel cheated at full price.In all, Japanese School Life is an enjoyable distraction that will inform about Japanese student life even as it entertains. If you're looking for deep story and characterizations, however, it's best to look elsewhere."
,Recommended,555640,29559154,Posted: 29 January,all,The Crimson Fox,"Very much the same game as ""Go! Go! Nippon!"" You're living in Japan for a while, and you make friends with two female high school students - one more impulsive and outgoing, the other more reserved and studious - who teach you a lot about the country. The biggest difference from that game is that Go Go Nippon focuses on the different areas of Japan, whereas Japanese School Life focuses on the culture and customs, with in-depth explanations of various festivals, traditions, and etiquette. As such, it's a good complement to that game if you're interested in a light but informative introduction to the culture.One of the characters publishes dōjinshi and sells them at a booth at Comiket, so a large part of the story involves that.Unlike Go Go Nippon (in which you accidentally walk in on one of the girls when she's half-naked), there is absolutely nothing suggestive in this game. Romance is limited to the main character accidentally saying the word ""cute' and lots of blushing happening.Both girls are fully voiced and well-acted. And one feature I didn't notice until late in the game is that mousing up to the top makes a menu appear with some items that aren't in the ""Options"" screen, such as the ability to scroll back to see previous lines of dialogue, and also the ability to display text in both English and Japanese at the same time.There are a few decision points in the story, but I don't suspect they change the events or outcome very much. Also, the main character is named ""Brian"" and the girls call him by name. There is no way to change the main character's name. If your name is Brian, like mine is, then this is wonderful and I encourage more games to name their protagonists ""Brian""."
