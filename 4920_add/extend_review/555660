The map is huge and takes you a good long while to find the Rake before he runs off at light speed.Truly hoping they update or fix this in some way shape or form."
,Recommended,555660,26639069,"Posted: 16 November, 2016",all,Skolent,"After leaving a negative review and seeing the developers listened to the call of the people, saying that the price should be lowered, proves that this game is indeed a work in progress. For $5 it isn't that bad, but I felt as though the price should've been lowered even further, and later increased over time as the content of the game increased.The gameplay: As of right now it is very dry, with no clear tutorial, thus leaving the gamer clueless and therefore disinterested. An inprovement as well would be a day/night cycle, when the rake would leave marks on your house overnight, like in the other game, where overnight the rake smeared pig blood over your trailer, begging you to leave its territory. Also the shop dude and the other guy just outside the shack are frozen, they offer no dialogue or motion. As well, the gun animations no doubt are going to be added, hell, the only way you even know if you shot your gun is the SD sound that occurs when you left click, not via smoke or recoil. Hunting the Rake; it is nice having the detector, definitely adds to suspense, but when you actually find the Rake, one of two things happen, you shoot it and it runs away at light speed, or it kills you in one swing. This is really anti climactic, but it is not unfixable. Having more interaction with the Rake post confrontation, would really make finally seeing it a thing to be valued, therefore fixing the boringness of the Rake's current state.My ""Unbiased as possible opinion"":It is a good game, has good potential, so I will reccomend it, BUT ONLY because of the future ahead of it, seeing that the devs will interact with the community and keep updating the game. Hopefully in due time, this game truly will become a great indie game, but like any other indie game, the beginning stages will always be rough around the edges. Also, any review that is negative because of the price, see that as positive, as the devs have already fixed that.THIS GAME WILL BE GREAT. GIVE IT TIME."

Dev if you read this this game has so muchpotential for the future and i believe that if you keep working hard on updating this game it will become something extroadinary. The rake is scary when or if you find him and the graphics or really good too. But maybe add a way too make it easier to find the rake.also try too add some type of story element too the game or at least an intro of what too do. I am only making suggestions too help you out you dont need to listen to me as I wouuldnt even be able to create anything you already have in this game. I would recommend this game to anybody looking for a good scare and who can see the potential in this game. thank you , p.s dev i wouldnt raise the prize anymore if i were you as people were mad about that."

,Not Recommended,555660,33055778,Posted: 30 June,all,wackwii,A very poor attempt at a horror game. This game plays like an unfinished game and i've seen early access games more complete than this. At first it looks like the older rake game but this one has myriad flaws.Pros-Better graphics than the original-not much elseCons-No tutorial-No controls menu-No indication of what you are supposed to be doing-shop is broken-car takes one minute to start-where is the rake?-This game promised multiplayer but it doesn't even workIn this stage this game is probably not even worth fifty cent unless you are buying to fill space in your library. If it was polished more it would be worth the money but I think the original rake is a better investment

Obviously not some big budget work, but good ideas and feel. Still seems lean and could use some fleshing out, but it's easily worth it as a cheap game and has potential with more polish to be excellent."

,Not Recommended,555660,29422735,Posted: 22 January,all,tlj24,"This game is just terrible. I had such high expectations because of the screenshots, but there were some MAJOR ♥♥♥♥ing flaws throughout the game. There are no totouials, so  in order to find out what key I had to push to interact with objects in the game, I found out that it was the ♥♥♥♥ing F key! Why not E or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Anyway, there is no story, it's almost impossible to find the rake, (I only say that because someone ELSE may have spent hours, and hours trying to find it.) There are npcs that make no sense at all, and have no actual purpose of being in the gane, there is no button mapping in the controls options, so that I can at least see what button I have to push for certain things, and you can't pick up items like the characters are at least seemingly trying to give you.  There is one good thing about the game though. There are good graphics, but overall this game is a complete waste of money, and it's a good thing that I bought it when it was on sale."

I payed $1.49 for this game, so I will review it as a $1.49 gameIm not exactly hours into this game, not at all. But so far I really can't complain. After reading the comments and seeing that this game was infact $15 at some point kinda confuses me, it's not a $15 game, yet. Even at $5 I think this game would be worth it (IF) the devs kept adding onto it.This game has potential, it really does.The good:It has the right atmosphereHas a pretty solid map sizeSmall weapon loadout that seems pretty typical, sniper, pistol, AK and a shotgun, cant really go wrong with theseA small amount of tools/gadgets that help you out through the game.The bad:Needs work, lots of it. The area is just a straight up forrest with like, 3 buildings and a couple cars, and the buildings are in your ""site"" if you want to call it that, really nothing to explore.The walking is kinda obnoxious in this game and your footsteps are really loud even after turning the volume downAs of April 6th, 2017, the multiplayer option does not work for me, hoping that gets figured out quickly.I do have faith that this game could be something, but thats up to the dev team. As stated in the reviews below, if the devs released Multiplayer and had some decent youtubers play it, it could be something.All in all, for $1.49, I can't complain with it. If it had multi, it would be worth the $5 they are asking."

,Not Recommended,555660,34993757,Posted: 16 September,all,LEGEND,"""Red Forest"" is a first-person horror-hunting game.Chernobyl. The Ukrainian territory of the red forest lies in the most contaminated zone after the devastating SuperGAU of 26.04.1986. Even today large areas are restricted area and belong to the most irradiated areas of the world. In the forests biodiversity increased measurably after the nuclear disaster. No wonder that rumors about frightening mutations arose.In ""Red Forest"", we have the task of cutting the rake in a limited forest area, a humanoid mutation that can attack and kill humans. For this, we should equip ourselves with the right tools at the beginning of the game in the starting building, which unfortunately does not explain the game. Of particular importance, of course, is a firearm and ammunition. However, we should also buy a tablet to have a card and a thermal imaging tracker. Otherwise, the search could be very tiring. We can hike through the forest areas without getting anything in front of the shotgun. The rake is also quite shy. Before the car with which we can travel, he fled, for example.The atmosphere is very successful. The dark, foggy area often lets one imagine things in the distance, which are then only the shadow of a bush. If the tracker fails, it can only be a wandering fox. The soundscapes bear the feeling of loneliness.However, the gameplay itself is problematic. Apart from technical weaknesses apart from that the grass grows through the Autoboden or the same does not have a hand brake, so gladly times, when you get off. This could be overlooked. However, when things do not work, sensors are not placed. Or even if there is no shortcut to the items. We have our tracker in function, the rake is in front of us and we have to go first with the mouse wheel through flashlight, map, sensors ... until we finally hold a gun in hands. Meanwhile, the monster has long since killed us and the three-hour search was free.Too many weaknesses, too many technical problems prevent the good concept to be really recommended.rating:7/10 atmosphere6/10 Story6/10 graphic7/10 sound4/10 Playing mechanics3/10 Balancing4/10 game playConclusion:Atmosphere alone is not enough.5/10 Overall rating"
