I've heard better / worseonly $0.99 though."

Yes, I know, not neccesarilly a valid reason. But if I thought if i ended up really liking it, it would be cool to be the first reviewer, and for 59 cents, why not? As a matter of fact this game WAS pretty good. Gameplay, while a little simplistic, is ok, the soundtrack is decent, and overall, this game's not half bad. While this certaintly won't be my absolute favorite game, I'll probably play it once in a while.+ Price~ Graphics~ Gameplay~ Soundtrack-  Not much!Overall:6/10"

YES YES YES and YESbuy this game"

In particular, as other reviewers noted, getting through the battery of moving lasers is usually a question of luck and button-mashing. Now suppose you have two or three such fields, and that's 5 screens away from the save... Challenging? Nah, boring."
,Recommended,555710,32138701,Posted: 2 June,all,infraredux,"Does what it says on the box; it's a minimalist twin-stick style shooter, although there's not much ""mowing down enemies"", it's more stick-and-move.  Bonus points if you like dark techno sounds, minus points if you don't -- the tracks loop often.  Expect an hour or two of playtime out of it, possibly more if you enjoy achievement hunting."

I did my typical ""First Play on Launch Day"" the same day this game launched on Steam and I gave it a ""Solid 8 out of 10"" score based on high value and fun scores, plus solid and bug-free controls.Here's the link to that livestream where I even made a suggestion to the developer on how to improve the game just a little with a very easy implemention:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3u9VnuvADcHighly recommended, you can't do much better for the price tag.. especially if you enjoy old school arcade kinda games!"

76561198326023938,Recommended,555710,29459378,Posted: 24 January,all,gullyDJ(FFiZ),what an amazing game. very very old school style top down shoot-em up with a cool minimalistic style that kind of reminds me of Tron. Very simple gameplay - nothing new - but done very very very well. It is hard though however when you die you always get that little itch that says damn you CAN get past that with one more try. got it with a 90% coupon for a whopping 0.08 pence. BIG fun - little PRICE.

,Recommended,555710,31123516,Posted: 13 April,all,Lyric,"This game is actually decently challenging and provides good quality music and atmosphere. The music, though it does tend to loop constantly except upon area change, is actually enjoyable and catchy. I quite enjoyed myself playing through this and I recommend it to anyone who likes twin-stick shooter, puzzle, and reflex games. Honestly, I believe that this game should be at least a dollar more in price, due to the fact that it is of a much higher quality than most .99 cent games!"

I will NOT give this game a good rating JUST because it was  99 cents and I got a coupon for it even. I simply do not like it and likely will not play it anymore. This is an oldschool arcade clone in the ....stretching this description really...style of vector graphics games like Asteroids. You are a ""ship"". You float around. You shoot things. But you also move through a maze. There are different types of things...monsters...ships...whatever the heck they are...to shoot. It is colorful and I do like the striped walls. But it also kinda feels a little unfinished and unprofessional. Like someone's child picked out the colors and design. The controls...are clunky. there is moving with the left hand and shooting with the right. And the movement of the mouse aims the gun. Well okay...This reminds me a BIT of Robotron where you had two joysticks, a movements one and a a shooting one. Moving with the left hand however...is not fun when you have infinite 2 D space yet for directions to move. Because when you are moving through a diagonal maze wear you die if you touch the walls it is not fun. The aiming with the mouse is okay though. Kinda okay with that. Probably would like it even more to have another set of keys to use. This game ramps up the hard vs the controls really fast when things shoot at you. The animation is almost nonexistent. There is NO satisfying effect when you actually hit something. No real sound effect. Not a lot of indiciation. You finally hit something enough times that it shrinks and disappears. That just isn't as satisfying. Now the reverse. When you get hit you never know it. You have 3 hits...or lives...or whatever. Once you get hit 3 times you die. I looked up and suddenly I had 2 hits on me. When did THOSE happen? Guess I came too close to a spiked wall and even though it never looked like I hit it (with those 4 way orthoganal controls) I guess it decided I did. Now let's talk about music. Okay cool kinda beat going on. I thought that the first few times I had to start over. Then I hated its guts. It IS kinda scifi like the name. Put z's and g's in a name and it IS sci-fi. That's a rule somewhere. Save points. There are quite a few of them....but still not really enough since you never really realize you get hit. HEre's a recommendation. Save your 99 cents. Burn the coupon. Go buy VVVVVV and you'll have so much better of a scifi floating around a maze experience."

,Recommended,555710,28230229,"Posted: 6 December, 2016",all,Freds Undead,"Update- After the most recent patch, Achievements are working on the OSX version now!Zolg is a minimalist shooter with vector retro style. It is quite enjoyable and relatively short, at the listed price of $0.99 you easily get your money's worth. It also is similiar to metroidvania style games and your first playthrough will take you the longest. The achievements are designed about replayability with time and shots fired challanges which extend the life of the game. I did notice that the OSX version has bugged achievements, of which the developer has been quick to respond (developer communication FTW!) I must warn you make sure you play with a mouse, on a laptop's trackpad you will get hand cramps quick after the first few bosses."

76561198189728457,Recommended,555710,28818746,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Dyrude Tiltstorm,"Zolg is a classic 2D side scroll shooter in the tradition of Galaga or other well-known space shooters, with the addition of obstacles that act to challenge the player like a platformer would. Despite the simplicity in the levels and enemies, Zolg demonstrates an increase in difficulty as the game progresses and as the player gets more comfortable with the control--and too add on the control, the addition of mouse-control as well as the WASD keys really makes for some interesting and fun gameplay. Don't let the simplistic design fool you though! Even the third boss is challenging! Would recomment to everyone!"

The level lets you explore where ever you wish, kill whatever bosses you want to in whatever order you like. The game is beautifully simple, the controls, graphics and mechanics. Power-ups are easily understandable and give the game an interesting and unique feature.AKA. I'd recommend it!Side note: I bought the game when it was -48% but feel I would pay the full price."

Plenty of games do it bigger, better and flashier. The game is fun though, the aesthetic is consistent, and the music is good. Nothing I heard became grating, like some jingles can. Overall, Zolg is a bang for your buck if you feel like a retro atari style game. I enjoyed it. It also seems like the enemies move in time with a section of the music, which I found visually pleasing."

76561198035383340,Recommended,555710,34427967,Posted: 22 August,all,Polichaos,"Zolg is kinda an adventure version of the old retro arcade games of astroid and such. Top down shooter.The controls are w,a,s,d, and using your mouse to click/shoot. Its that simple.  The term they are going for is ''minimalist''.  They got it, in a good way.  Navigate through a labyrinth map of baddies and intense puzzles to defeat bosses with special abilities to gain health and special upgrades yourself. Things like double shooting, stronger shooting, moving stones and getting sheilds. Through all this you get to save at certain points. Usually before a boss fight kinda thing. The game is rather straight forward and at your pace. No loading is neat, just run amiss to areas you havnt been to.  The game is all neon and colorful, not '' Yellow submarine'' color, but its flashy with some beats. The music is techno, but it kinda repeats. and repeats. A bigger background music selection would be nice. The game is challangeing and can be frustrating, but try try again. Lots of acheivments though !"
