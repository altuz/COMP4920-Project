76561197991097142,Not Recommended,555750,26765867,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,jHn,"Another piece of crap for the virtual junkyard.Clunky animations, hitboxes of doom and weaponhandling direct from hell.The so called ""campaign"": Win a Deathmatch, eliminate three enemies and survive 50 seconds. Are you serious?I can't say ""AVOID"" often enough, you have been warned.PS: The ""Devs"" should reconsider the name of this game and eventually call it ""Avoid these Forces""."
,Not Recommended,555750,28102612,"Posted: 30 November, 2016",all,Proxykon,"""Masked Forces"" is an underwhelming First-Person-Shooter experience with tedious grind, as well as missing distinguishing features from other titles in its genre.Design & ArtI can give some praise to an existing main menu, many developers coming from Steam Greenlight neglect this really easy step.Apart from that, Masked Forces does not try to impress with its visuals.Small to average-sized maps with grey-in-grey visuals and some visual clutter common for FPS-genre games (e.g. the all-time favorite shipping containers) try to make your stay more welcoming but end up making the appearance even more ridiculous with their not to scale props.Playermodels and weapons are actually somewhat diverse, yet are mostly just black or grey.No color customization and/or variety - a missed opportunity.Overall, average graphics that stay above a consistent 30 fps. On the other hand, Masked Forces is visually unappealing for me.On top of that, I have reason to believe that this game used unedited templates and assets from an asset store, yet I cannot confirm.Music & SoundOne ever-repeating orchestral track in the main menu that is already used in the trailer.Weapons sound weak and shallow, bullet impact is reduced to a simple ""squish"".An announcer has been added, but is very inconsistent regarding his announcements.Very limited soundlibrary; sound effects repeat themselves fairly often an start to become ennervating easily.GameplayHere is the rundown:The game is a grindfest.You are expected to run the""singleplayer campaign"" (as advertised in the description)togrind EXP and CASH.Getting enough EXP earns you player levels, some CASH reward for leveling up and lets you unlock new weapons which, next to that, also cost money to buy and upgrade. You can also invest into some armor which lets you take more shots before biting the dust. This includes different facial masks, which seem to exist for customization purposes only.""Singleplayer"" Mission objectives are easily summarized: Kill X amount of enemies without dying, Win a Free-for-all/Deathmatch, Win a Team-Deathmatch, Survive for X amount of seconds. That is it.I believe the multiplayer only features Deathmatch and Team-Deathmatch. So much for ""multiple online modes"" (as advertised).By now you should have realised, that Masked Forces does clearlynot have a ""singleplayer campaign"", but a simple matchmaker against bots.You grind these bot matches for a tedious amount of time until you have everything there is in this game (I achieved level 10 in about an hour, highest level 30 could be achieved in about four to seven hours). After that, you could only enjoy some multiplayer matches.WeakpointsFirst of all,this game tries absolutely nothing new.Even in light of the omission of this to enjoy a game,there isn't even solidity in already trodden paths!The game just blatantly copies what so many other FPS-genre games already did, ridiculously failed with and still decided to run with it:Stale multiplayer gamemodes, a leveling system combined with the necessity to grind out gear, missing customization options and a multitude of glitches and/or bugs.Starting with my biggest pet peeve;the gunplay.Full-auto fire? Impossible, even with the Minigun. Walking further than five steps with ironsights or red dot sight drawn? Impossible. Expecting strafing and walking forward to have the same movement speed? Unthinkable. Player movement and gun behaviour overall is just off-putting, sluggish and very strange. Even after over one hour of playing, it still felt wrong for me....wait, what... a MINIGUN? Yes, you read right,there is a Minigun as well as an RPG-Launcher in this infantry-only game! And if that isn't ridiculous enough, the RPG kills EVERYTHING in ONE HIT - absolutely gamebreaking.Also, you get to keep the weapons you selected in the main menu after death, but it seems like bots just receive a random weapon after each death. So enjoy them insta-gibbing you with their Boomstick.This game needs health bars for enemy players. Why, you ask?It takes a ridiculous amount of time and bullets to kill an enemy with the starter SMG. Yes, even if you aim for the head, you need AT LEAST two headshots.The pistol (your starter secondary) has a super slow firing rate, while it resembles a Desert Eagle, which is a semi-automatic pistol whose rate of fire is practically as fast as you can pull the trigger.You receive a starter armor that gives you +20 health.But only after you gathered 15.000 in CASH (about an hour of grind) you can finally buy a vest that gives you +50 health. You know what I call that?Player imbalance.People jumping into multiplayer right away are not on par with players that already played for a decent amount of time. You have effectively one fifth less health and worse weapons.Enjoying your ""immersive multiplayer"" (as advertised) already?Concluding ThoughtsMasked Forces may conceal itself as a standard multiplayer FPS game but make no mistake, this game is90% grind. You do missions to get resources, you invest resources, you level up, you hope to find noobs online and bash them. This is clearly not fun, at least not for me.Establish player balance, construct additionalPylonsand more diverse map layouts, reduce the grind, fix the gunplay and the bugs/glitches, give players more customization and offer more gamemode variety. If you can do and offer all of the named things, you are worth my recommendation and even a raise in price.But as is, this game is just tediously bad, even for less than a dollar. And let me tell you, I have played games in this price range that had more effort put into them. Let me give you one example as a closing statement...http://store.steampowered.com/app/259530/?l=english"

Don't get me wrong, you can still have fun with this game, especially with friends, however, there are tons of issues with it that make this hard to recommend. First of all: ""Campaign"". There is a reason I put quotations there. Really, all that the campaign has is just multiplayer maps with bots and a few objectives. The bots have a way faster reaction time and also can have faster fire rates in some guns. Not only that, but they use guns that you can't even use. It might not seem annoying at the beginning, but later on, it gets pretty unfair. There is also multiplayer. This is the most fun you will probably have with this game. It is totally unbalanced, full of glitches, but it can still be fun at times. Really, you decide if this game is worth your money. I can't really recommend it or not recommend it. I really wish there was a ""Meh"" button."

It feels smooth enough for a stripped bare-bottom shooter. A decent look, nothing innovative or game-changing here. You have 1 class, multiple weapons to unlock and everything sits behind that ""digital"" play for wins, earn cash and spend. The servers are up, but controlled by bots and the very curious player, who like myself, only hop onto servers for the multiplayer win.All in all, 8 simple achievements that can be beat in an hour. No real end-game or growth to be had. Im sure a leaderboard exists for something like this, maybe kill counts or levels earned, but being the top man in this bracket is....Meta. Badges as well for that potential 600 steam XP. It is what it promotes, a simplistic shooter."

Of course it's not Battlefied or COD, but let's not be getting ahead of ourselves - those games have 10 years of development in them.  This is a neat little shoot'n scoot game if you just want to run around and have a FFA shoot up."

You will experience severe lonleyness. Bad graphics and only like 4 guns. I would rather actually play a FREE flash game then play this. Bad game, shouldn't be on steam"
