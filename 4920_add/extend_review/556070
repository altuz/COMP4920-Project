76561198169700297,Not Recommended,556070,29736423,Posted: 5 February,all,DatFancy,"Game is AMAZING, really neat take on the incremental genre of clicking and idoling, you get to assemble your own world and run your farm the way you see fit.Review here is negative because devs have not updated or commented about the game since December 3rd 2016. Seeing how the game is supposed to take 3-6 months to develop fully, and then get released, 2 whole months of the devs going missing? seems fishy. Ill change to positive after the game gets worked on again.The game is worth 3 dollars now i would say, just dont get your hopes up on new features in early access cause this project might have been abandoned."

But with the horrible optimization I refuse to recommend."

,Not Recommended,556070,28081442,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,diealein (unseen strings),"(This review has been edited)edit march 13th: I have reason to believe the dev has just up and vanished, AVOID SCAM.While neat in concept, this game is too feature barren to really suggest.After a point it just becomes a chore to upgrade your turrets,keep your spawners powered up,and build your space up to match how large the terrain gets. And at that point, if you have enough of a specific upgrade tier, the one above it becomes cheaper.It needs work, i see a great game if it is developed right, but right now you can get far better for free.edit 1st of december: They have added a feature that adresses keeping spawners powered, and also to allow life plants to auto collect.Theres still bugs with this according to someone else, if you upgrade it after applying the coin it loses the coin. But the devs are paying attention.As i have refunded the game, i only know the changes that are announced in the updates. If you own the game, please comment whens something specific happens to improve the game so i may update this review."

Been playing it for the last couple hours and thought I had finished until I accidentally clicked one of my turrets, turning it into a new currency. Now that there is a whole new level to advance to I'm going to come back once I've gotten some sleep.EDIT:Alright. I've been playing this game for over 24 hours now so even if I try I couldn't deny that its a bit addicting. It's got a lot of neat concepts in there and a fair amount of lategame stuff they I haven't reached yet but I'm having fun. At times it can get a bit grinding but you can say that with most incremental games that have been released.I still recommend this game to anyone that wants to have a bit of fun designing a bullet-firing, monster-killing, gold-looting contraption of a mighty scale."

,Recommended,556070,28302631,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,iBeat,"Turret Architect is Hand Down one of the best ""Cookie Clicker"" Games I Have ever Played. At first glance it may not seem ""Amazing"" but take my word for it, This game is dope if your into A Cookie Clickers, And also, YOu dont even have to click that much, You set up a spawner and a turret once and your set, Expand From ther. Now if you Are thinking about buying this game Then do so, If your the type of person to download games from other websites, Then even still, Buy this game if you think it would fit your style of gameplay. Trust me Its worth $2.99 and I Think in all honesty, Buy it now before the gmae devs realize its worth about $2 more then what there selling it for, It should be a $5 Game but they are selling it $2 Cheaper and if you ask me $2 can add up.Just to recap, Turret Architect is a Cookie Clicker style of game, Click and kill Mobs (In this case they are colored blocks) and buy turrets and spawners, Upgrade those turrets and spawners to get Maxed out on upgrades then Reset when you feel a little bored and do it all over again. Good Game, Nice Concept, Cheap, Simple, Family Friendly, And much More98/100 -Lack of Instructions (Tutorial would be nice on what every ""Object"" Does. I for one was Confused on what some of then did.)"

,Recommended,556070,28129711,"Posted: 1 December, 2016",all,Ixath,Fun game. Not a ton to do right now but I feel there is more than $3 worth of content in it so far.Worth picking up if you're a fan of incremental games.
,Recommended,556070,29305943,Posted: 16 January,all,kreezxil,"Aside from all of the bugs reported inhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/556070/discussions/0/152390014800403778/?ctp=2#c142261352653692443, I would still recommend this game. It doesn't take very long to come back to the game after you encounter a bug and if you if use the in-game ""exit"" button you shouldn't too much of  a loss of anything. It does clear the board of mobs and gold when you do come back and it doesn't run in the ""background"" so-to-speak as there is now jumps in resources when you return to it.It is fun tho in seeing how fast you can generate the resources.Please keep in mind that it is classified as an Early Access Game and that it only was released this past December 2016, so it's doing really well for a month old playable Alpha.I would recommend to the author that the skills be randomly dispersed per world, you can keep their occurrence sequence the same but make them be further apart, to give us a reason for the land expansion. Also with the first world they should be a minimum of 500 blocks apart, that way there is an incentive to at least 4 life exchanges to get to the farthest one. Also add more and then make is decide which ones to keep when we find them.Oh, and despite the bugs I did go ahead buy the game after playing the demo, I was hoping the bugs would be fixed in the regular but they weren't, however, still very fun and if steam had a 5 star system this would easily be a 3.5 star game."

,Not Recommended,556070,29316372,Posted: 17 January,all,DatrixTHLK,Dev isn't trustworthy no transparency. Game is dead. Dev vanished. Hasn't been updated in 7 months. I don't recommend this game at all if you even want this game think long and hard about who you are willing to support on steam. Devs who abandon games are not worthy of support. 3 dollars is more than enough in fact too much since this is an unfinished game. Don't waste your money on this.0/10 will never buy again
76561198061471234,Not Recommended,556070,29111064,Posted: 8 January,all,DingusLord,Worst game I have ever played. Literally worse than cookie clicker. No strategy. Poor graphics. Poor game mechanics. NO CONTENT. Could literally make a better game in a weekend.
