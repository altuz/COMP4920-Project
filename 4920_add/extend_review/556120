,Not Recommended,556120,29742456,Posted: 6 February,all,etsi™,Misspelled English text. Non-sense. Childish attempt at being funny. There's no game here.
,Not Recommended,556120,31279644,Posted: 21 April,all,Grindcore Jim,The grammar is painful and the gameplay is excruciating. The entire game is just one big JPEG.There's a small chuckle with the references to political figures here and there but the game is not worth the money. Not even worth the money after using the discount of 90%.I highly recommend the creator of this game to abandon this and look for something they can actually be proud of.
,Not Recommended,556120,31409956,Posted: 27 April,all,AlohaSnackBar,"By far the worst ""game"" I have ever played. Translation, graphics, gameplay... everything is truly terrible. Humor is supposed to be its strong suit, but even that fails to deliver.(The reason I have 4+ hours is that I left the game running for trading cards before actually playing it.)"

,Recommended,556120,34800926,Posted: 7 September,all,Darius,"To be fairly honest I started this game and expected some funny David Icke references and some poopy UFO cult references. However, I was astounded to be greeted with some of the best gameplay I've seen in a while alongside a storyline that draws you in like expensive perfume on a very expensive Slavic escort.This project is a genre unto itself and for a measly 2$ I would advise you to do nothing short of buying this game and playing it."
,Not Recommended,556120,30300285,Posted: 3 March,all,Chemical Taint,"I received a 90% discunt on this game but I still probably overpaid. Looks like it may be a mobile port since the only functionality is to click on objects, whether to attack them or simply interact with them. I'm not sure if this game is supposed to be funny but it was non-sensical for sure. At the time of writing it is still in early access but I'm not sure it needs to complete version. I finished the game in about 30 minutes but most of that was watching the story and not actually playing anything. There is a LOT of the strange story and none of it can be skipped. It is also very buggy - the mute button only works until the next ""sound"" kicks in and then all music and effects come back on. I had to use Windows functions to mute this game completely. There was also a part where I was stuck in a loop where I would click something to proceed but the clickable objects were overlaid on the next screen and if I clicked at all it took me back to the previous page, causing an infinite loop. I resolved this by simply not clicking anything and letting the story play out."

,Recommended,556120,30386416,Posted: 7 March,all,VoiaGamer,"Great game, it was hilarious and always kept me laughing no matter what section I was at. The twists and turns around each corner were great. Even if not on purpose, the poor English made it feel more authentic to the game's setting. The art as well is very nice and makes it feel more enjoyable. I defnitely suggest it."

,Recommended,556120,32425490,Posted: 14 June,all,☭Junior the MadPony☢,"It is a simple yet amazing game, its basic, fun, and funny, and the grammer is odd because you do have Russian's writing english, besides, I have a number of Russian friend's who talk like this as well, I think it adds a better experience. It's a cool game for a cheap price, you can't go wrong."

,Recommended,556120,29696482,Posted: 4 February,all,juliuszhorst,"Reading all those conspiracy theories about Anunaki, Lemurians, Pleiadians and gray aliens is one of my guilty pleasures (and pretending to believe them is a great way to avoid social interactions with people you don't want to interact with :)). This game doesn't dwell into the lore of those theories too deep but it made me chuckle a couple of times and for the price - that's all I can really ask for. Hope it gets finished."
