76561198025580495,Recommended,556180,32300491,Posted: 9 June,all,The Quaker,"Some improvements needed, but overall this is a really great game.Gameplay: 10/10If you enjoy either Dixit or Clue/Cluedo, there is little reason for you to hesitate purchasing this game.  At a 1/5th the price of the physical copy, with Pass & Play capabilities, I found this purchase to be a no-brainer.If you're interested in seeing how this game is played, watch ""TableTop: Wil Wheaton plays MYSTERIUM,"" on Youtube, to find out more!UI Aesthetic: 10/10The UI successfully captures the mood and keeps players engaged in the game's narrative.  There appears to be just as much artistic design included in the UI as there was in the original game pieces.Additionally, the soundtrack is on point!UI Design: 7/10Functionally, the UI could be optimized in a way that is more user-friendly.The magnifying glass capability seems useful on a tablet or mobile device, but it feels unnecessary on a computer.  With larger monitors, it would be more effective to have a ""closer look"" option, that scales each card up to the constraints of the monitor.When the ghost reveals who was correct in interpreting their visions, players lack two basic functions:1. Players cannot pause play and take an extra second to evaluate who was correct2. Players cannot review the incorrect guesses made by fellow Mediums.The latter can be seen prior to submitting predictions, but it would be nice to toggle that information during the reveal.As a fellow designer, I also believe there is a better way to represent player guesses (in full table overlay), than to place small colored tokens atop images to which they often share similar values or hues.  It took me a number of play throughs to not only notice, but recognize their significance on the board.  Black is a frequently used color character, and his token looks like a paperweight that adds to the aesthetic, rather than serving a functional purpose.Paperclip-style markers might prove more effective or, at the very least, more legible.Online Multiplayer: 7/10The multiplayer lobby definitely needs improvements (though this shouldn't discourage anyone from purchasing the game).If you are looking to solo queue online, you should have little qualms about multiplayer effecting your decision to pick up this game.  So long as there is an online presence, there is an opportunity for you to play.For people looking to join games with a buddy or two, however...  the multiplayer lobby lacks incredibly important features for creating games--a ""start game"" and ""kick"" button.When a lobby reaches its maximum number of players, the game begins immediately; oftentimes without players being able to see who was last to join.  So, in theory, you may join a game and, just before your friend hops in the lobby with you, a stranger takes the last seat.  The game begins right away, and you won't discover that your friend was left high and dry until they tell you via 3rd party communication programs, or you deduct their absence when they fail to respond to in-game chat.This leads me to another necessity in multiplayer...When playing online, the only way to identify who is which character is to associate the color of their name in chat with the background color of their character's icon.  One would think it more userfriendly to provide the username of each player when a character token is clicked on, or hovered over.Though i've yet to encounter anyone who wishes to troll games online, I find it naive for programmers to assume that a host might not want particular players joining their games, if they have a reputation of crashing the party."

So based on this I can tell that this digital game is great. There are some small bugs around (letter 'P' in chat, for example), but the theme is great in both the multiplayer and solo mode. I can recommend it to any board game owner who thinks about to buy this.Negative part: very few people are online on multiplayer. If you ever manage to play, that is better than playing in solo. However if no one is online, then it is a bit hard to enjoy it."
,Recommended,556180,29212139,Posted: 12 January,all,RandomMaster,"The game is absolutely great. The few games I played make your heart race as you try to find out whodunnit.If anything I do feel like some of the ways the game displays info is hard to pick up on immediately. Such as being able to scroll to the side. If you played the board game before you'll be wondering why there are so few cards for a moment.The system for showing you everyone else's visions and the specific cards the Psychics are looking for definitely are fine. The chat menu being up at the top can be a bit annoying as bringing it down hides the view and you have to rehide the chat before you can look at something else. Makes switching between other psychic's visions quickly a bit of a challenge as you first have to say what you think a person's card is, hide view, click new psychic, look at their visions and the options they have left and then bring down the chat to tell everyone your idea.I haven't tried the story mode yet but to be honest I believe the multi-player is where it is at in the end. The interaction with other people makes it very exciting to play."

But it's good for what it does. It definitely needs a bigger online presence - through Steam - and a way to make password protected games for your friends. A little tweaking of mechanices, but otherwise, it's a very faithful adaptation of one of my favorite board games of all time."

I went to get myself a cup of coffee (from my kitchen, not downtown coffee shop) and I was already kicket out! And as the game doesn't have much players online (worldwide or what??) waiting 15 minutes for a game only to be kicked out from it in less than a minute is horse shait."

Easy to get a hang of, hard to master... which leads me to one suggestion.It would be great when playing against the AI, if at the end, the game let you know the connections between the visions/cards and the guilty culprit.We've played it several times and would have loved to have known what detail in certains visions were relevant to the correct suspect/location/weapon.Just to learn what we missed.Other than that little suggestion, great stuff!"

There are several areas that need improvement, but it is a well presented digital incarnation. The Devs do seem to be responsive to our input, so it is very promising.If you enjoy abstract deduction games, definitely check out Mysterium!"
,Recommended,556180,32606246,Posted: 20 June,all,Radagahst,Amazing game. Just a shame that it is dying. People should play this more and devs should market it better I guess!
,Recommended,556180,32872013,Posted: 27 June,all,Grief,Play as Ghost is very creative. and exhaustive. fun to play. Don't forget to grab some friend and argue with other though lol.
,Not Recommended,556180,31505614,Posted: 2 May,all,-ҒŁOΡ25-,"I review only the video game not the game itself which is very creative and more interesting than the classic CluedoThe game is made for tablet, with an interface tactile friendly and big icons. Unfortunately for PC, that's not user friendly : drag and drop mechanism, no tool-tips (!), scrolling is sometime very very slow, the color code for identifying the characters is too subtile, many space wasted due to a layout not optimized for our big screen, some small icons could help identify who does what, who received what, who did what etcThere are some bugs. if you exit while having an introduction (at the beginning of a mission), the typewriter noise will keep playing. If you drag and drop near the edge, the card flickerThe solo against the IA is full of flaws: It's ALWAYS the same final murder. So once you get to the final step, you can cheat by keeping the best card at the end or, if you're not the ghost, you can answer whatever the ghost says. When you are playing as a medium with the IA, since the IA can't make you lose, at the guess of the weapon, you just have to choose of the few weapon not selected by the IA. And when you have the voting system, the IA tells you if you are right or not !Hopefully the solo is optional, but it is sad to be glad to have a solo totally pointless.The multiplayer suffers from a match making not user friendly (again) ; the game option can't be changed after creation while waiting for players, the game starts instantly without a few seconds to decide if the last who joined is someone you want or not in your game, when you want to join with your friend an existing game you can't create a 'clan'. Of course the multiplayer game has the same stupid interface not exactly made for PC.When a user is badly behaving you can only Ignore him but not block him for entering your game, report him etcOne last thing a dump technique has been found by players quite controversial, due the game letting the mediums to be able to pick a answer before receiving a clue: when doing so and if the medium has right the ghost send its useless cards  therefor saving a crow. Useful but quite far for the original game spiritI have mixed feeling about this game since the game mechanics are good and addictive when played with friends or at least in vocal, but the game as a Pc sofwtare is only fair or poor"
76561198104076481,Recommended,556180,34388092,Posted: 20 August,all,Flames99Fuse,"Fun game with a clue-esque gameplay. Although it isn't without it's bugs and glitches, a large majority are visual only. Gameplay is both simple but extremely complex and in depth.Both the psychics and the ghost are extremely fun to play as.I love communicating with other psychics to figure out what the more obscure hints mean.I love playing ghost and praying that the psychics make the connections, then get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when they connect the wrong part of the card.The cards have enough variety to easily apply them to multiple situationsI just love it, great party game, and still awesome alone. The community (though small) is super friendly and really cool.The few bugs/glitches I found:Using in-game button to close window crashes it.If you're holding a clairvoyance vote when the timer expires or all psychics ready up for next stage, vote stays on screen.If two players join a lobby at the exact same time, they take control of the same person. (Impossible to win)For ten bucks, you cant really go wrong! If you catch it on sale, definitely grab it up. I just wish it had a 4-pack option to save a couple bucks and send the extra copies to my friends."

,Recommended,556180,29492095,Posted: 25 January,all,Miz Hyde,Great concept. It's a nice multiplayer game that demands some reflexion. The real downside is the lack of players and the few bugs here and there.
,Recommended,556180,29262154,Posted: 14 January,all,ronstadt,"The game is about theory of mind: you need to guess what one player is thinking although you cant talk to him/her. You comunicate by trading cards. You can play two different roles in the game: either as team member (mediums), or as MC (the Ghost). the game is about associations between images a ghost combined in order to help mediums resolve a murder case. the images are mysterious and very symbolic. You need to dig deep in your mind sometime. mediums and Ghost need to find the right associations so they use cognitive processes like generalization, analogy, shape comparison, semantic similarities and so on, so bring your brain with you.very cool game. we need more and more players. nice and fair community. very addictive."

76561197968494146,Not Recommended,556180,29220772,Posted: 13 January,all,Cadwalader,"I love board games, saw this pop up last night. First thing this morning, I bought the game.Nice graphics, nice music, alot of atmosphere, fairly good reviews by the people who know the actual board game.Problem is, it's not fun. Unless of course, I'm missing something.You try to guess the murder, location and weapon based on cards you're receiving from the dead.Then you gain additional points based on you betting on the other players guesses. But their guesses don't seem have anything to do with your actual case. Then finally in the end you see what everyone else guessed and what you guessed and then finally you all have to guess based on a new set of vision cards from the dead who actually did it.What I'm missing is the multiplayer component. I completely fail to see how this game becomes more fun with more human players. There seemed to be 0% difference between computer and human players.Which brings me to the multiplayer mode. When I logged in, there were literally 4 other people available to play with.I'm going to let that sink in... 4. Worldwide.I'm really trying to give this game a fair shot. Maybe, I'm missing something. But that would be the tutorials fault.Because I played it, and that's just all there is to the game, according to the tutorial. If there's more and I'm just not playing it, it's the tutorials fault, because it didn't tell me about it.And the severe lack of other players isn't a bonus either. So unfortunately, I'm opting for a refund after almost 2 hours played."
,Recommended,556180,29236092,Posted: 13 January,all,Skinker,"I am a big fan of the cardboard version and have played Mysterium many, many times before getting this digital version.  This is a wonderful Clue/Dixit mashup.  Most of the fun for me comes from the interaction with other players.  Figuring out clues from abstract art is challenging and oftentimes quite funny.  Love the cross-platform multiplayer which allows us to play local co-op using different devices at the same time."
,Not Recommended,556180,29247378,Posted: 14 January,all,Gopo™,It's a fun Cluedo/Dixit hybrid but I can't upvote it due to the lack of local multiplayer. I will change my vote if this changes in the future.
,Not Recommended,556180,34879711,Posted: 11 September,all,lannpaige,"I picked up Mysterium in the hopes that it would be entertaining enough to play with my brother. I didn't realize when I purchased the game that Mysterium was based on a board game. I still haven't had a chance to play a physical copy yet. But if the physical copy is better than the Steam version, I'd like to try it one day.In the Steam version of Mysterium, there are two different roles a player can take: a ghost or a psychic. There is only one ghost at a time. There can be any number of psychics up to seven in online multiplayer. Each psychic is given three cards that they have to guess - a person, a location, and a weapon. The cards they're guessing are unique to them. However, anyone can guess any card that's still available on the table. The ghost helps the players guess their specific cards. They do this by handing over vision cards that match up with the target cards in some way. Using the images on the vision cards, the psychics can work together in order to determine who has what cards. At the end of six rounds, the players then determine what murder the ghost was killed in.Pros:- Comes with a story mode that doubles as a tutorial.- The story in said story mode is actually pretty interesting.- Graphics are smooth and polished.- Cards can be expanded and magnified so viewing is easier.- Has local and online multiplayer.- Online multiplayer has a chat so psychics can easily speak to each other.- Audio enhances the game nicely, but is easy to turn off.- Many promos and expansions can be unlocked - only one requires DLC.Cons:- Visuals seem clucky because there's so much on screen.- Sometimes it's hard to understand why the AI guessed certain cards.- The parts of story mode where you play as the ghost can be frustrating.- The story mode killers are always the same, so story mode can't be played twice.- Navigating the multiplayer window is a little confusing at first because the screen is so busy.- It's not clear how the promo/expansions unlock, aside from the ones offered to you when you complete story mode.In truth, I really would like to play this game with my brother still. In fact, I plan to. But if it wasn't for that, I likely wouldn't pick up the Steam version of Mysterium again. It has a lot of potential, which is why I'd love to play the physical version of the game, but something's lost in translation. Unless you're aiming to play this with friends in person without AI, I wouldn't really recommend buying this. Even then, you might be better off buying a physical copy."

Would recomend if you are a fan of the original game or just like card/board games on PC.

The game itself is interesting however the multiplayer mode doesn't seem lively. Even though the game released yesterday there were barely any players online, I waited 15+ minutes with another guy in a lobby before deciding to screw this and quit. Refunded."
,Recommended,556180,29236642,Posted: 13 January,all,BlackHandGang,"If you have played the physical version of Mysterium and enjoyed it, this is everything in a digital version that is great. There is one press and hold mechanic (for magnifying on person/place/weapon and clue cards) that feels like a mobile port remnant, but as the cards as large, if no larger that physical games' cards, I fon't think it that much of a bother.There were a few things that were frustrating, one of which I talked to the Asmodee Digital Twitter about, and the others I noticed through playing more of it. The first thing was Crow mechanic. I was stuck on the third case of the story mode for a while simply because I didn't have a crow woth any cards that would hint to the suspect in the end. The crow helps you (the ghost) discard clues and draw new ones. I feel like either that should be introduced at the same time as being a ghost, or slightly rig the possiblities of getting at least one helpful clue by the end of that case.The next thing, kindof related, is that I think repeat tries of Story missions don't need to have the tutorial pop up and screen locks. It makes it a bit tedious, if, like me, you get stuck on one mission for a while.The last thing is one unfortunately we, the players have to fix. The multiplayer is very sparse. when I was playing there was a total of 7 players. And that's not going to change until word gets out and people pick up the game.But these things are small compared to what the game has to offer and easy for the devs to work on. I think this is a great buy and tell your friends!"
