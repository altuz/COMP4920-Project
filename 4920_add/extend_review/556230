I played with the Vive and everything works great even steering with the contollers, which I thought was going to be hard. Made it through all 40 levels and can't wait to go back in with the new rig I just got.Things that make this fun;offroading, crawling, jumping, bouncing around, finding different lines, crashing, damage, upgrades, seaguls flying into you and dying, spinning tires,  different camera angles with drag cam and 3rd and 1st person view, quick loading times, great graphics, easy to pick up and play, I could go on  and on.Now I just need to figure out how I can use my vive and steering wheel!"

,Not Recommended,556230,28315076,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,Punkers,"In it's current state the game is playable and fairly entertaining.  However, there is still a lot of work to do before calling this rock crawling ""simulator' a finished product.My video on it - caution - lots of swearingThe first true annoyance is the vehicle audio.  It's awful, simply awful.  It's super loud, sounds like the recording mic was directly in the engine bay of a semi-truck.  It sounds nothing like what you'd expect from whatever vehicle you're using in game.The very next, second, annoyance you'll find is with the camera.  I swear the camera in ""orbit"" mode is literally trying to get you killed.  It's actually worse than the obit cam from BeamNG, which is saying a lot.Physics model seems ok.  However, the suspension set up, amount of grip, and power are completely out of wack.  The suspension is way too stiff.  Vehicles bounce all over the place because of this.  Tire grip is greatly exaggerated, so much so that you can actually flip the vehicle back on it's wheels in some roll-over situations.  Lastly, now I don't think I've ever said this before, but the power these vehicles put to the wheels is just way too much.  290hp, sure, but the vehicles all feel like they're pushing well over 1000 ft lbs of tourqe,  Wheelies are cool on a strip of pavement, but not when you're precariously positioned on a rock.Game crashes occasionally.The game has tons of potential, though, don't get me wrong.  It's fun, too.  But I just can't recommend the game in it's current state for $11 cdn."

76561198155754531,Recommended,556230,30515932,Posted: 14 March,all,Rangborg,"I liked this game. I love my Jeep and  I love driving it on trails so naturally this game drew me in. I have played spintires and once this game works out a few physics issues I would say it is as good at capturing the offroad experiece as spintires. Spintires never really gave you the opportunity to do any real crawling and this game does.Here's my main issue. The vehicles are far too bouncy. I wish there was a way to air down the tires or fine tune the suspension set up because you drive over a wooden bridge with any form of speed and your vehicle is bouncing off the trail. It's almost like the vehicle has no weight. When you go over a crack you bounce out instead of the tire going down in and requiring a bit of work to get out. When you approach a rock instead of hitting it nice and slow and crawling over it you bounce and bounce and hope you dont bounce off the trail.The tires are another issue. I want to be able to lower my tire pressure to increase my grip on the rocks. These over inflated tires are like riding on balloons. They're jsut too bouncy! They also do not grip like real tires do. It's too easy to slide on obstacles that wouldn't slide on in real life.Overall I really enjoy the game and will continue to play it despite my issues because it is fun and you can just group the bounce issues into part of the challenge. But at the end of the day, I would like it to feel a lot more real so I can experience the challenge of crawling when I can't take my own Jeep out on the trails."
,Recommended,556230,28289343,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,SKΛTΞºʳÐ¡Ξ☠  [222],"I love it.  It's like having a big R/C car right in front of you that is slightly heavier and floatier.  (really depends on the vehicle, they're all different.)  I went from the first Jeep to a Range Rover and the difference in weight was night and day.It also has 2-player Local Multiplayer.  One gets VR, other gets the screen.  You both race at the same time.There's some ""Arena mode"" that says, ""Coming Soon"".  I imagine it being some kind of destruction derby because the damage models are amazing!  It's almost like BEAM NG or something.  I mean, you can pancake these things and have the doors and wheels fly off.I can hold the left grip (VIVE) and move the whole map to whatever perspective I need it to be.  I like to drag the water right up to my nose.If you've ever played Tilt Brush.  You hold grips in both hands and expand them.  And everything becomes MASSIVE.  I WISH I could make the truck lifesize.  It would be g*ddamn amazing.  (UPDATE:  Vehicles are massive now!)Tons of unlocks, tire sizes, steering wheels, suspension, engines.  I'm pretty sure they're going to add tuning.  150 tracks.  Create your own tracks.I definitely recommend this for anyone who likes TRIALS, R/C and/or anything Offroad.OR if you like Bigmouth Bass swimming around your feet!"

This game has NONE of those things.  The throttle is binary, meaning you're either sitting still or rocketing forward at a speed that won't allow you to do anything except hang on for dear life.  Even with the Steam Controller, barely applying throttle, the vehicle wants to shoot forward like you're flooring it in a McLaren F1 car.  Don't buy this.  Just don't.  Spintires is a MUCH better off-roader if that's what you're looking for.  And if you want VR toys, I'm sure there are much better examples of those out there too."

I hope there will be open terrain driving and courses: I really enjoyed that aspect of Screamer 4x4. Right now the game is like minigolf on wheels.It's beautiful, but on keyboard controls the accelerator is touchy and there are no gears; so the vehicle bounces around. It's a matter of haphazard bouncing to the goals.For now I'm stuck on level 15. I'll come back later, maybe I'll have acquired some twitchy skills in my sleep.

I enjoyed it enough to restart dozens and dozens and dozens of times after rolling my 4X4 into the ocean.Is this the Dark Souls of jeeping simulators? Where are the mudd pits, sand dunes, dirt paths lined with evergreen trees? Nope, just rocks and wooden structures in the middle of the ocean.I'm a sucker for physics puzzlers and I love off-road games so this really hooked me anyways. Controls seemed pretty good, lots different camera perspectives, really takes advantage of room-scale virtual reality if you play on the HTV Vive.I must admit though, the isolation and impossibility of the situations made me feel a bit like I was role playing a 4X4 enthusiast's version of purgatory.Nice work!"

76561198134740638,Recommended,556230,29304116,Posted: 16 January,all,riko00,"I would like to add an edit, as of update 11 the in game damping and the weighting of vehicles has been much improved!  there still feels to be a degree of moon gravity going on at times with some of the reactions that the vehicles give but both driving precision and the consistency of the handling have both increased, a real step in the right direction! some of the newer levels are also a fantastic improvement, really rewarding careful and precise control in general while adding extra challenge if you pursue the totems!   Big thanks to the dev team for taking the communities suggestions on board.I have played for just over an hour so far, using a controller and monitor, the graphics are good and on my system with a little over the minimum requirements will run smoothly on max settings.  The recommended settings may be more of a guide for VR use.The core idea of the game is solid, and seems to play its best when aiming for the motor trials ideal.  The levels that task you with difficult turns or routes over complicated terrain I have found the most enjoyable, allowing the player to have a chance to get to grips with the vehicles and the games use of physics.  Unfortunately often the game faces you with levels that amount to no more than target shooting, firing the trucks at a part of the level geometry in the hope of landing somewhere near the finish.  In these cases the game can be frustrating and tedious, the bouncy, poorly damped nature of most vehicles handling combines poorly with the feel of low gravity that the game gives off in most levels, let alone the actual low gravity space based ones.The music in the levels quickly grates and the vehicle sound effects are poor, there also appears to be issues with sound volume and camera position, meaning that quite often on the jumping levels you launch the truck into a distant rock to hear no sound from its collision with the ground, only for the camera and noise to catch up as the wreckage rolls into the sea.I can see the core of a good, maybe even great, game here, but I feel the developers should look at spliting up the more technical levels from the zany and crazy ones and perhaps open the levels out in physical width, allowing for a more natural playstyle that gives the player a chance to devise routes and learn how to make the most of the game engine.  weighting the trucks in a more realistic way, modifying in game grip to give more actual usable power to the ground to better represent traction but at the same time reducing the trucks tendency to back or front flip would also improve the feel of the game.The new 3rd person camera is a fantastic improvement, but I feel adding pitch adjustment would also help greatly, in a game focussing on careful movement through difficult terrain having a very adjustable and mobile camera will help the player in the long run.I am happy with my purchase of the game, I understand its position as early access and am happy to see frequent updates from the developers and I am also interested to see what the community can produce with the in game editor, it is the next element of the game I am interested in trying.Do I recommend this game?  at this time I think yes, I hope for good things in the future and am encouraged by the updates being produced.  Others may find more value when it is picked up on a sale but I have enjoyed my playtime overall."

I played the demo, that was rather cool, but once you progress past the first 10 or so levels the game gets ridiculous. The ""physics"" engine ist just a random piece of garbage. Apparently trying to slowly drive down a gentle slope breaks your wheels, accellerating slightly makes your car go wild and steering in general is just hinted at. Pair that with moronic level design (""physics"" based logs that need to be overcome, pyramid shaped ""bridges"" with no way to maneuver, daring ""loophole"" jumps that are purely luck based and even levels IN SPACE, where ""gravity"" is different, i.e. unpredictable and you have yourselves a wonderful pile of nothing. I can't recommend the game as it is. But still:Your goal is to complete each level with one of the trucks available to you (I've unlocked 3 so far: a safari type car, a small range rover and a huge pickup that was literally useless for the first 28 or so levels I've played.) Your side objective is to gather a ""totem"" (why it's a totem I have no idea), which gives you upgrades for your car...or at least I think they are upgrades, since there are no descriptions in the game whatsoever. And the camera, my god, the camera just keeps on rotating and is generally a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ It was even worse in early access, but oh my.Maybe they realized how bad their game was when they applied a 60% discount only 1 month after release already. I've requested a refund. Sorry, you've tried, but this is unplayble. And I'm not even gonna talk about the random frame drops. What your game needs:- a better, more consistent physics engine- a better steering model and more precise controls- tool tips- actual car differences other than size- better level design (heck, at one point you're literally forcing the player to drive off a cliff and hope they somehow land not in the water and intact enough that they can somehow reach the end. That's not good level design. Obstacles need to be fun, but also matter. Better luck next time."
