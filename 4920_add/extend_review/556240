,Not Recommended,556240,30890090,Posted: 1 April,all,Various Words,"TL;DR: Good idea, plagued with problems that come together to bring it down.I wanted to like this game, and I did enjoy some of it. The idea and Antichamber-esque aesthetic is pretty cool, and some of the puzzles are decent.The puzzles in the first half, that is.After that, the game became horribly tedious.The main, huge problem that I have with the game seems pretty small at first. Basically, the level resets if you fall off. This seems reasonable and small, and it would be if the game was only inspired by Antichamber and not Antichamber and Portal. The problem stems from this because the levels are huge, and the later levels want you to take leaps of faith. The problem is that you don't know when you're supposed to take these leaps of faith, and if you forget to rotate a section of level, or just take a wrong leap entirely, you have to fall off and reset the level. The game seems to want you to take risks, while punishing you for taking risks at the same time.Another problem I have is the lack of gratification, which is HUGE in a puzzle game. At no point did I feel like I had accomplished something. The levels were either so easy that I breezed through them, or were excessively hard simply because the levels are so large. The game expects you to memorize the entire level and what each switch does, because forgetting this means walking all the way back  to the switch/portal/button to remind yourself. This makes the game slower, meaning it's even worse when you fall off and the level resets.I could go a bit more in-depth about these issues, and some minor problems that stem from these few, but the review's big enough already. The only other thing I want to mention about this game is the price. Definitely don't buy the game at full price, even if you think you can overlook these problems. I got all the achievements in 2 hours, and the game costs $4. Definitely wait for a sale. Or buy Antichamber if you haven't already. It's a lot like this game (but better and it has a better idea of what it wants to be), and it goes on sale for about $5 frequently."

The puzzle concept was interesting - I've played The Bridge and Mindcubes before and found this a similar kind of gravity/perspective twisting puzzle and was looking forward to getting into it. It's bare-bones graphics, but that works (you wouldn't want too much clutter on the screen as it's a challenge enough to figure out which way will be up when you turn a corner). I didn't have any of the issues others have had with achievement-spam and clunky controls (playing on PC with keyboard and mouse only - seemed alright).What wigged me out was that the game gave me pretty hardcore motion sickness after only a few minutes. I'm not prone to this normally (get it occassionally in cars if I'm trying to read a lot), haven't had it from a game before, but with this one I had to go lie down and close my eyes for a bit before I could do anything else. I tried coming back to the game after a little while and it happened again. The controls are WASD to move, the mouse directs the camera so you can look around. I've played games before that had similar control setups and haven't felt sick so it might be something about the perspective shift and constant looking 'up' that triggered the motion sickness for me. This is the sole reason why I'm giving a negative review - so far as I could tell from the brief time I could play it was otherwise exactly my kind of game (love puzzlers). I just didn't get to play it much. Not really the devs fault, but it's a shame and perhaps a useful warning to others.So I can't tell you what the later levels are like at all! First few levels didn't throw me in the deep end too much, took a little bit to get the hang of it but not more than two levels. There's very little instruction, but you don't need much. Each level took just a minute or two at the start, though I can see how it would get pleasently harder."
,Not Recommended,556240,31334648,Posted: 23 April,all,[TG]Venaul,"decent concept, poor execution.  a good puzzle game will give you all of the pieces you need to complete it, but not tell you how they go together. and when you figure out the answer, (at the very least) you feel like you accomplished something.  i dont get that at all from this game.  I found myself wandering around and trying to make sense of the environment, turning knobs and pushing buttons until i eventually found my way to the exit.  there was no understanding of the level that led me to its completion, so upon completing the level, i didn't feel like i had earned it.  think of it like a maze on a piece of paper, but all you can see of the maze is a small circle around your pen.  you wind up taking every wrong turn in your hunt for the exit, and when you finally get there the only thought that crosses your mind is ""well i had to get here eventually""i though disoriented was just a clever title, but that's exactly how this game makes you feel.  every button and knob looks the same, so it's difficult to keep track of all the puzzle elements, let alone which sections of the map are modified when something is changed.  Theres nothing to associate sections of the map that move with their corresponding knob.  this game would benefit greatly from some color coding (blue knob moves the blue section, green knob moves the green section, etc).  another tool that would assist the players is a map of the level, like a scale version of the map that you can rotate and zoom in and out and whatnot, allowing the player to start the level with with at least some sense of direction, rather than happen across the puzzle elements one by one.also, the free achievements for just loading the game is stupid."

It's nice that you can progress step-by-step by exploring every option until you've exhausted them all. I assure you that you will experience a sudden spike in difficulty. If you are a mathematics major or diehard Portal fan, then I recommend this game. Is it worth $5.49..? No. The art and music are lacking but there's relaxing ambience and I'd certainly recommend buying it on sale to practice your reasoning skills. I got three hours of gameplay! There is a sense of satisfaction from beating the harder levels but there are not enough large levels! You can try to beat your friends' times but I have no friends so I think the game is worth $4. If you find the geometry too confusing, don't worry because you can usually beat a level by trial and error and there are no red herrings. I would like to see more levels."

Okay, I got the game on a sale at 0.99€ so it was a good deal but still, I think it would remain good at 3.99€ without a doubt.Some people say that the controls are bad. What? These are very basic and standard first person shooter controls. Nothing special here, and it works quite well.Some people complain about the 666 achievements. Dunno why it's here, seems like a bug, but I don't care. Why would I?The visual style is nice, minimalist and stylish.The game in itself has a good learning curve. In the end, puzzles are hard, but always feasible if you familiarize yourself enough with the environment. Tab key and then unzoom may help (I discovered it on the middle of the game).There is no story, but I like watering the plants :)In addition, I played the game on two computers on two different places, and thanks to the Steam Cloud support my saves were kept, and the game ran smooth enough on the ""not powerful"" machine I though would not be able to run this (I just had to disable stuff like anti-aliasing in the game options). Very appreciable."

The name suits it because it can certainly be disorienting at times as you try to adapt to teh ever changing, MC Escher-like dimensions of the world.The artstyle is clean, flat-shaded and cel-style.  After a while, you hope for a little more interest in the visuals but overall it's a pretty relaxing experience as you meander through each level.At the price point they've set, I think it's probably worth a look if you're into 3D puzzle style games."
,Recommended,556240,29289529,Posted: 15 January,all,A Can of Orange Soda,"I don't write reviews often but this game deserves some recognition.There's not much to it, but for its $4 price tag it's worth it if you like puzzle games. Disoriented is a game where you simply (and by simply, I mean not simply at all) reach the exit. You'll have to keep track of your orientation and manipulate the objects around you in order to reach it.There's a solid 24 levels as of right now, and the game gets progressively harder as you continue on, unless the game enters a level where you learn to use a new mechanic. The game starts off pretty basic, but the later levels will surely have you turned around, thinking of any and all possibilites you can take in order to reach the goal. The game is also accompanied by a very peaceful soundtrack. Overall, even if the game is a little short (I beat it in 2 sittings), this is a fun, relaxing, and very solid puzzle game."
,Recommended,556240,28858230,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,wydawg,"This is an excellent 3D puzzle game that takes simple mechanics and makes use of them in mind bending ways. In some aspects it strongly reminds me of The Bridge. In particular, the atmosphere is very similar making use minimalistic graphics that combine exceptionally with the puzzles. As in The Bridge which direction is up changes. However, rather than making use of a 2D world filled with illusions, it uses a first person perspective in a 3D environment. This leads to simple mechanics quickly turning into difficult problems to solve as your perspective changes and you fight to visualize the 3D solution. In addition, one particular mechanic introduced in the later puzzles (#17) makes for some very interesting problems.The two wishes I have for the game:Linux support - As a predominately Linux gamer I would love to see this on the Linux platform, however it is well worth booting up windows to play this.More levels - At the time of writing there appears to be new levels in the future, but I wanted to include this because the ground work has been laid for a large number of possible puzzles. The puzzles were great and I would love to see more of them making use of these exceptional mechanics.Overall, if you like puzzle games this is definitely one to pick up and spend time with some mind twisting puzzles (at a very reasonable price)."

,Recommended,556240,28052031,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,edderiofer,"Before you get the wrong idea from this review, I should note that while I enjoyed the game, I felt I paid too much for it.Disoriented is a first-person puzzle game that takes inspiration from Manifold Garden, Monument Valley, and possibly Hocus. The goal in each level is to reach the exit, which is simple enough. However, because in puzzles, things aren't always so simple, each level is a weird 3D stick model, where you are able to walk up walls by using the curved ramps.Naturally, because this alone would still make it just a maze, the game later introduces some mechanics, like switches that change the layout of the level, and portals that drop you through them. The very much unique implementation of the latter is what really brings out the puzzle design in the last levels of the game.True to its name, you do very much get disoriented when playing the game because of the core gameplay, given that you're constantly turning and that there is no objective ""down"" direction. (This is less of a problem in Manifold Garden, which uses a similar mechanic, but also uses the level's architecture to keep the player knowing what's what.) In any case, this is perhaps part of the charm of the game, but it does get in the way of the puzzle sometimes; especially when the platform you're trying to get your bearings with is blocked by some other platform, and you can't just move around it without falling into the endless void (which resets the level).The game runsverysmoothly, (which is indeed more than I can say for some Unity games I've played). I'm assuming this game was made in Unity, which I've heard is horrendous when it comes to performance, so props to the developer on that!The game has 23 levels, which are all fairly short. As you can tell from the gameplay time listed here, I completed the game in 79 minutes, so you should expect this to be a 2- or maybe 3-hour experience; this game definitely does not overstay its welcome, and some of the levels are definitely memorable (which is much, MUCH more than I can say for games like Flow Match, Rotieer and Duplexer). Still, for the price I bought it at (3.39 GBP), it definitely feels too expensive; I personally feel a fairer price would have been 0.99 GBP. (I should probably re-evaluate my pricing criteria at some point, but not today.)However, there's a reason for this; the developer is raising money for his other game project, for which this is basically a teaser. Considering that this game is at least in the upper half of games I've played, AND the developer is still updating the game with more music and leaderboards, I have faith in his next project and you should too. Hence, while I could refund this game, I won't. Because between overpaying for this good game and not-paying-at-all for it, I feel like I'd feel guiltier doing the latter.In short, very good and short relaxing game, but still much pricier than other good games. Definitely buy this if it's on sale for 75% off or more, but above that, you make your own decisions."

For the sale price, I figured it would be tough to be disappointed, and pleasantly I am not at all. Gameplay is straight forward with a gradual learning curve. Puzzles are not exceptionally difficult, but are sufficiently rewarding. As some other reviewers have noted, it may benefit from deeper elements, something approaching a story, purpose, or meaning. Additional puzzles beyond those included would also be a strong selling point if included. As is though, I found the game's soundtrack to be peaceful and calming, especially in those moments when I truly was disoriented and in need of unperturbed thought. For the price, it was a nice distraction and I would recommend it for anyone who is a fan of the genre."

Puzzles often have a lot of walking between actual actions, which is fine, but mildly obnoxious. Walk speed is a little on the slow side, even with the sprint.With the amount of camera rotation, it gets disorienting very quickly.

Despite the fact that there are only a few simple game elements and you can usually see most of the board, it can be a significant challenge to figure out how to get from one place to another.You'll probably enjoy this more as a game to play every now and then rather than trying to mow through it all at once. The music is airy and relaxing, and the graphics are very simple but effective. If you like challenging visiospatial puzzles and zoning out as you play, I can all but guarantee that you'll enjoy this game for many hours of play.NOTE: Installing this game used to give you more than 600 blank acheivements, which would ruin the achievement account on your user provile and throw up blank empty boxes on the screen—and no way to get rid of them. Initially the dev did not want to remove them because some people apparently purchased the game solely to 'earn' 600 free achievements. After a lot of complaining (including mine), the dev finally removed the spam achievements, so I'm changing my review from negative to positive because the game itself is relaxing and fun. Props to the dev for fixing a mistake (assuming Steam didn't simply force the change)."

The mechanics are easy to understand, with only a few twists and turns - thankfully... Treat it with a casual mindset and the game will become easy. Overthinking leads to restarts. Really, there is only one way through each level and once you get the hang of it, you'll find it is perfectly laid out in front of you."

The objective of the game is to water all plants on a level to get to a doorway to the next level.The farther you go the more difficult it gets adding new features to disorient you. Overall its a very difficult puzzle game with ""free"" achievements. Worth buying especially with a coupon code or on sale."

,Recommended,556240,34396086,Posted: 21 August,all,Microsoft PowerPoint,"The game is fine. It's a good puzzle game with some interesting mechanics. There isn't a whole lot of content, though (only about 30 levels), though they can get pretty long and intricate - especially the later levels. I think the amount of content reflects the price pretty fairly.So why don't I recommend the game? It has 666 achievements. 6 of those achievements are earned by playing the game and ""finding"" this game's version of collectibles; little plants that you click on to water them. They are not hidden in any way, and you are practically (if not literally) required to pass by them in order to beat the levels. The other 660 achievements from this game are pure spam. I earned all 660 of them when I first started the game in an annoying spam in the lower righthand corner. It's ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and it's clearly meant to get extra purchases from people who actually care about their achievements. It's a shame because it's a pretty good game otherwise.UPDATE: The developers have removed the spammy achievements from the game. As a result, I now recommend it. Good job, BrickCream!"

76561198025018402,Recommended,556240,35170415,Posted: 23 September,all,gigawatts,"Fun, fairly short puzzle game. Does a decent job of helping you get used to gameplay mechanics - the first time you see them, they aren't too difficult to use correctly. The gameplay video actually shows you all the mechanics in the game: 1) walking up a curve changes which direction is down, 2) there a switches that piece a part of the level, 3) there are toggle switches to change between night and day and there are platforms that disappear/appear because of that, and 4) there are teleporters. The levels do a good job of putting these mechanics together in interesting ways.Biggest dislike is that the run button doesn't increase your speed by very much."

Puzzles can be linear and take like not much time at all or take more time to find the correct path to exit. Mechanics in the game are good, though really cannot play for too long without getting disorientated. Value for money for those who want a simple puzzle game that is sufficiently mind-bending (in finding out which way you can go)."
