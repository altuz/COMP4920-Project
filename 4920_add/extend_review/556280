Doing this you only have to press the UP key and the rest of the movement is dependent of the mouse.MY OPINIONWith the Mouse option enabled this is an enjoyable game. I liked specially the Soundtrack. The visuals are OK for this kind of game. In my opinion the gold medals are so easy to obtain in the 90% of the levels (sometimes I finished the levels like 30 seconds before gold medal requirements). Another good option to spend a couple of minutes while enjoying and completing an indie game from the team Just1337.

I found that the music did not match the game, but that is just my personal opinion. Yours might differ, and that's ok. :)Still a fun little game, but would only buy it on special for under a dollar, as I did.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fqVGCPF1Ro&list=PLGCO4EfbVB6XXoAnQMUJjoEh3c2BLfHx8&index=75"

,Recommended,556280,29105954,Posted: 7 January,all,Zildjian52886,"This game is beautiful. Although the concept may seem simple, this game poses a challenge. You are a spaceship and you have to collect all the objects to finish the level. You are also provided with certain abilities to help you. Just starting to play  the game I was pulled in and  this game got me hooked. I think that this is the perfect game for those who like action, or casual games. It is also a great game for when you are bored and do not know what to do, or play."

Luckily there's no real guessing, so you can eventually learn patterns to get through levels and beat the target times.  More playable with a controller so that you can make those fine movements."

Even if i got it for 0,2€ it's still not worth it.It's  just a fast made garbage with no special desing. Levels are made so bad and annoying, soundtrack feels like it's just some electronic mix dropped into, also much small but frustrating bugs.I ended this game in 1h20m with 100% achievements. It's even possible to end this game in 30 minutes if someone needs a games for 100%, take it on sale. But in other way- don't. I woulnd flame developer, because i thought it's something made by guy who just started learning how to make games, but he actually made much more bad games and put it on Steam. He even made second Neon Prism in 2 months..."

I got to about level 11 or so before I ended up raging out of the game.I came back and turned on the ""Follow Mouse Control"" button and suddenly everything became clear. There was still challenge in many of the levels but simple enough to be completely entertaining as I ran through on my lunch break for a few days in a row. I will be playing the rest of the neon games soon."

The sequel is better though."

I smashed my keyboard with a baseball bat..Seriously though, for a quick puzzle game, this one is pretty good.  It drove me crazy at times, because the puzzles are actually pretty challenging.  The gold, silver and bronze award system keep level completion rewarding and competitive.  This is the best arcade style, racing puzzle game that I've ever played.  Another Bonus: it has a surprisingly impressive soundtrack that goes with the gameplay.The replayability is high, especially if you compete for scores against friends.Overall it's a challenging and refreshing arcade experience.  It's worth a try or at least an hour of your time, especially at this price.I give it an 8/10 and would buy it again."

Good choice of trap and dubstep songs. They work briliantly with the game- Levels are well made with inovative ideas.- Developers: try and adjust the rotation when using the controller, by implementing a different gradient deppending on how far the Left Stick is being pushed.Other than that, great game! I paid 16 pence as I had a 90% coupon but it's definitely worth the whole price!Have fun!"
,Not Recommended,556280,33057751,Posted: 30 June,all,Edboy,It's an easy game but it sucks the life out of you. Probably not worth the 4 hours I put into this game.PROS:Easy for the most part. You can be ~10 seconds faster than the Gold time a good majority of the time.One of the easier games to play if you want to 100% it.CONS:Some levels are hard and hurts a lot.Not worth if you paid for it (I got a code for this game when I leveled up my Steam account).Your fingers now have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

Some of the game mechanics weren't always clearly defined or even totally necessary (I achieved 100% gold without using the Slow ability).
