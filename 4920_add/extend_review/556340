,Not Recommended,556340,29652242,Posted: 2 February,all,WeirdWizardDave,"I'd love to recommend this, and I've thought hard about if I should review it at all. But at the end of the day it just isn't a game and the fact this is the 1.0 version out of early access seems to imply the dev is happy with it as it is which really isn't right. There is potential but its woefully light on content and gameplay right now.The premise is fantastic, play a huge godzilla like monster (well the head and hands of one anyway) and rampage around a city area smashing up buildings. But sadly that's where the gameplay stops, you just smash buildings for essentially no reason. There is a target level of destruction at which point you unlock the next of the available 5 levels. But beyond that nothing happens, nothing challenges you, you simply cannot fail. Even the planes that show up form level 2 onward to strafe you with machine gun fire don't actually do anything as you can't die, or even be hurt.As it stands its okay fun the first time through which will take 10-15 mins. After that there's almost nothing to bring you back. Early hopes of the game opening up and more depth and challenge being introduced give way to a realisation that it really isn't a game at all. Instead it's basically a toy lego town to play in. Maybe good for very young kids but for most this is going to be too shallow of an experience to hold your attention.Sadly its another seriously underdeveloped and shallow VR experience, something which is really letting down the incredible potential of VR at the moment and possibly one of the reasons why I'm being more harsh than I might otherwise be. But VR devs need to step up to the plate and make more compelling and engaging content or this amazing tech won't last.Anyway with a lot of work it could become amazing but it seems the dev is happy with it so that is unlikely. I hope I'm wrong about that. In the end I would of refunded, only it crashed on exit apparently and steam kept running the clock. So I'm stuck with it. No biggie as at least its quite cheap and I can hope that the dev might return to the project and add some game to this interesting idea.  ﻿"

,Recommended,556340,32796506,Posted: 25 June,all,samguyjones,"It's not entirely a game.  You play an unbeatable monster.  However, it's fun and really immersive.  There's something about attacking a city while tiny airplanes dive in at you that makes you forget about everything else.  This game ends up being more threatening to my walls and furniture than any other because you kind of get lost in the rampant destruction.I wish the game had been more forward about how to use the breath weapon.  You grab both triggers on the Vive to breathe fire (or shoot lasers if you picked the giant cat).  Also, I don't know that this game will pull me in forever, but for what I've paid for it, I got tons of enjoyment."

This game is a fun little stress reliever where you can just go around and destroy whatever you like.  The only con about this game is that it gets repetitive after a few minutes.  It would've been nice if there was some sort of armed force fighting back against you.  Maybe that would've made the game more fun.  Would like to see that in future patches.

Nice destructible environment and funky green monster hands.Good fun for kids too and 3 year old enjoyed it but couldn't use the teleport function so would wander away in search of more things to destroy. A mode that used the boundaries (he knew enough not to wander into the sea) to define the environment would be great and save my furniture and walls.

This game is very simple right now with a pretty basic theme which is walk around and smash stuff. It's inexpensive and has a ton of potential! I've always loved games where you're a giant monster and the goal is to smash as much stuff as possible!As far as performance issues I noticed a bit of frame lag and also lost the ability to grab object 2 or 3 times in the 20 minutes of gameplay I did. When that happens I noticed the menu buttons will not allow you to restart and you have to force the game to close.THIS GAME WOULD BE INCREDIBLE WITH A LOCOMOTION MOVEMENT SYSTEM!! That would kind of give you the ability to destroy and crush stuff using your feet as you walk over stuff. There needs to be little civilians and maybe police/military peoples running around the city as you destroy it that you can pick up and eat. Maybe little news and military copters scooting around in the air that you can swat at. Maybe take it even as far as having 3on1 co op where 3 players are the military dudes in a similar view as the Out of Ammo first person view and one is the monster fighting eachother. Or just co op where everyone is a monster running around breaking stuff. It would be neat to be able to roar and blow fire with the grip buttons on the controller.I recommend this game because it's cheap and fun and has a lot of potential; I cannot wait to see what stuff the devs add in the future for this!  Great Job!!

It's VERY easy to get carried away and forget where you are in relation to your boundries. Highly recommened if you're looking for a game to help others experience your VR set. I played it on the Vive and even though I bought during the Summer Sale, I would have still paid the full 5.99."
,Not Recommended,556340,33802004,Posted: 25 July,all,tapalisa,"This is a cool concept that's been hampered by some poor design decisions. It ought to have been awesome to stomp through and destroy a town, but instead you end up painfully bent over waving your hands frantically at nothing. The look of the game is nice and the feel of smashing things is satisfying but it's hard to enjoy.-You ought to be able to play this game standing, but instead the structures are at knee-height. It calls attention to the fact you wish you had feet rather than gracefully designing around it. I ended up sitting on the floor.-You get punished for teleporting with an annoying fade to black, so you don't want to do it, but you constantly have to.-You can kind of pick things up and throw them, but they don't do any damage to other structures. You want to be able to smash a house with an ice cream truck, but you can't.-The objectives of the level float oddly out of your line of sight, so you aren't really aware that you're supposed to be doing something besides smashing as much as possible (why would you want to do anything else anyway?)-The screaming humans become disturbing after a while.The game is cheap and has some interesting things about it but I'm still waiting for a good godzilla experience."

It's really cheap, it is adequately fun, and it does what it sets out to do. It provides you with a few different cities to wreak havoc on, and a pair of monster hands to punch, pound, grab, and pummel the city with.There are nice touches to the game, for example if you teleport on a person, you'll squish them. There are other elements that left me wanting more. I would like to be able to shoot lazers or fire breath or something, unfortunately, no beans.About the worst thing about the game is the ice cream trucks. They're EVERYWHERE and play a tune that ALMOST mixes with the game music, but not quite.A slight tweak and they'd be able to make the music match up, which would make it sound almost cool, as opposed to right now where it's quite annoying.That being said, I did enjoy exactly 27 minutes of virtually causing mayhem. It reminds me a bit of Maxiumum Overdrive VR, only that one had a more enjoyable city-scape mixed with a 2 minute time limit.Thankfully, this game lets you spend all the time you want, demolishing every last building and stomping ever last citizen.All in all, it's worth it for the price paid."

The scale is supposed to make you seem really big, but it just makes the city look like a toy. It would have a greater sense of scale if you were a little smaller so you could smash buildings around you. I'm pretty tall and had to just bend over swatting at them.  Throwing should also cause more damage. There are objectives but there might as well not be. Why not make it so you can take damage and have waves of enemies attack you?

There are buildings, aerial vehicles, trees, vehicles, people that you can smash around with your monster hand, you can execute a fire breath to destroy them. There are about 4-5 levels, and the last is a sandbox mode where you can smash stuffs with no objectives. You can even play as a giant cat with paws and lasers eyes too.This game has got a large potential, but unfortunately it seems there won't be any future update (such as more characters, climbing buildings, more vehicle varieties, more environments and buildings like bridge etc or leg stomping with the Vive trackers).This title is not just entertainment for kids but adults too, and is a great title that is play in short burst in between longer games. But beware you really need sufficient spaces to play this game. Destroying buildings as a kaiju in VR is rather satisfying."

Was impressed with how the buildings reacted to being punched or picked up, felt really cool to pick something up in one hand and punch it with the other. And that fire breath attack from holding the sidebuttons? Amazing. Made sure to wreck the whole city before posting this review.

Check.Want to pick up an icecream truck, chuck it at a helicopter, grab the helicopter while it is falling and use it as a club to smash people and buildings to bits? Check.There are 4 levels with objectives, but tbh, once you get to the last level, its just a sandbox. Very much reminded me of the old arcade or NES game rampage.

But overall, I still had quite a bit of fun and this is saying a lot since there are really not a lot of fun games for vr right now.Finished the game in 30 minutesWhat's good?:-Bright and Fun graphics-Simple to play-Makes you want to act like a giant monsterWhat's bad?-Not long enough-Some controls you have to figure out yourself-Gets boring quick"
