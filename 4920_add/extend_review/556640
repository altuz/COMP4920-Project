,Recommended,556640,28519133,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,Untold,"Have you ever watchedGladiatorand wished that you had been born in 100 AD? Do you wish that you could spend your time fighting for your life before a Roman emperor instead of working for Nationwide Insurance?If so, I'd recommend that you play this game.Gladius is not perfect, but it's the best gladiator experience on the market right now. As I booted up the game, I was immediately impressed by the graphics-- detailed textures and beautiful lighting and fire effects-- and thereby realized that this is a high quality game. I utilized the teleportation system to move around the training area, but walking with the trackpad is an option for people who want a more realistic experience. I discovered upon exploring the training area a collection of weapons and helmets that can be unlocked by beating different challenges in the arena, which does give the game some replay value.Once I picked up the sword and shield and put on the helmet, I was ready to fight. I started round 1... and was literally dumbfounded by the scale of the arena. Granted, the environment is not perfect-- the audience looks like a bunch of cardboard cutouts who raise their hands at the same time in enthusiasm, breaking immersion-- but the arena itself is so huge that ittruly feels as if you are there. The proportions of everything feel correct, and the arena is gorgeous, with godrays coming down from the sky and different structural details that make the world come alive. The enemies come quickly and are relentless, swinging fast with different attacks that challenge your reflexes. To help you, though, the developers have created a feature allowing you to slow time and set up the perfect parry or slash, and they have also made the enemies pause between each attack so you have a chance to launch into a counterattack. The combat feels good, and I am glad it does as it's the focus of the game. There are some problems with hit detection, and there are a few glitches (when my sword hit the tigers, the game made a clink sound as if I were striking at a shield), but the combat is excellent overall and becomes a workout.As the blood splatters on the arena's floor, the audience screams in a wild frenzy, and sweat runs down my face, I remember why I invested in virtual reality in the first place. It's to visit exciting worlds both old and new, interact with the environments, and have fun, and this game checks those boxes. Gladius is a blast!"

I'm generally dubious about melee in VR just because of the ""waggle the controller"" method of winning, but this game does a pretty good job of requiring you to fight like you mean it.It's probably still cheese-able, but if you want a solid melee fighting experience and you treat it like one, it will reward you for it."

VR Roman arena combat bliss. 1 smashed knuckle, 2 smashed controllers, 1 pulled trapezius muscle, and a bath of my own sweat. Fighting waves of 2 tigers at a time with a sword and board or 3 gladiators from in 3 directions as a crowd of thousands cheer you on is unparalleled entertainment. Provided, of course, you can withstand the real physical pain. Release your inner Kirk Douglas! Brilliant work, Devs! You just need to add the ability to smack your sword into your shield complete with sound and haptic feedback. We NEED this for complete immersion. Alright. I need this!"
,Recommended,556640,28534365,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,WarMachine,"The game is good for what it is. An early access gladiator sword play game. The price isn't bad for what you get, and the game play while not yet solid, is really good. I don't like to review an EA game until late they are finished unless I believe the value is already there or they broke it, I will change my review if the game goes down a bad path.I don't think the Dev team is that large, but they are listening to the community. There will be incidents, the game has bugs. Hit boxes for the player seem off, and weapon damage radius seems off. The Devs knows about it, along with the physics (they say more realistic weighted physics are coming.)Overall, I would suggest the game for the price. It's priced right for its place in EA. The Devs has some good goals, more content and multiplayer that I'll be looking forward to.Pro,It's a gladiator game.... the crowds throw stuff at you, cheer, and make the background feel real. It feels proper as a wave 'shooter'.Large selection of enemies, weapons, and armor.It's a workout on harder difficulties.Cons,The crowds feel real until late you look at them, they look like cutouts, small issue.Weapon Balance is still being worked on, and I don't think armor has any effect yet.Bugs can make harder difficulties harder then they should be.Overall a good game I would rate 3.5 out of 5. Definitely get it if you a fan of the subject matter. It's off to a good start, and I'm am really looking forward to where the Devs take this."

That being said, it's a fast paced and accurate VR fighting game. I particularly like the realistic graphics and the lack of clipping. You smash your weapons against enemies, armor breaks and limbs fly off. The pace keeps you fighting until you are physically too tired, even if there is no higher gameplay goal. The fights are fun, fast and satisfying, and the game updates every couple weeks at the time of this review. Cool game nice job"

Look at some gameplay so you know what to expect. The combat is satisfying, but there is still some room for improvement. It can get quite intens on the hardest difficulty and can definitely get you sweating.

,Recommended,556640,32078250,Posted: 30 May,all,JonJonJP,"Short version:*For $10, this is a no-brainer. Still an easy choice at $15.*Join the Discord -https://discord.gg/KSK2CqD- and help with testing and development.*Core combat physics are RAPIDLY improving and are easily enjoyable by this point*Dev is highly committed and passionateLong version:Damn, have I not reviewed this yet?Okay, so - I am a big Sword Master VR fan. It's one of the most enjoyable games out there, highly immersive, and fun for pure swordplay enthusiasts. It makes me incredibly sad that the dev is done with that game. Swords and shiz are why I bought VR - that and guns and other stuff, but really mostly sword-y stuff after playing Circle of Saviors at an arcade here in Tokyo.Gladius, when I initially came across this game, didn't really engage me as much - the combat felt clumsy and not as immersive. BUT, since I've bought the game and helped actively test betas and provide feedback (the Day 3 bow/arrow crash involved a lot of testing on my end before we got a fix), it's become clear that the dev is really committed to making this a premiere sword combat game, along with a lot of really fun period/fantasy content. Communication lines are clear and open, and the dev is actively listening.Of course, I'm talking about the future. Right now, the game is still fun. For your pure swordplay enthusiasts, you have a Training mode in a small arena with a highly-customizable set of enemies, and adjustable animation speed (being tweaked in a future release) depending on how smooth/easy you want your combat. I like to cheat and turn on debug mode, have unlimited health, and go into Training mode with a couple of Barbarians (two-handed wielders = easier to read and parry attacks) for awhile. For those wanting more of a campaign mode, you have the Games (as in of the Colosseum), which are a bit limited now but have more content coming in later on - including Co-op play!As to weapons and shields, there appears to be a strong variety on first blush, but you'll find that certain weapons are a lot harder than others (the shorter your weapon, the harder you're going to find your life, since enemies only come in close briefly - and shorter weapons don't seem to have any greater damage than longer ones). It would be fun to see a viable option like the jagged short-sword/dagger/whatever in Sword Master VR (a personal favorite in the off-hand). However, there are interesting weapons like the khopesh, and you have your token katanas as well - plus two-handed weapons, although I believe that's being fully implemented in the near future. Shields are ... I suppose fine? I don't use them much, although I should. The dev has said he'll be putting a bit more variety in shields to create more varied gameplay.Physics: Good, and improving. The dev has spent a lot of time lately on making collision physics more accurate and satisfying - which has shown in how well swords and shields interact now. There are a few areas where parrying isn't quite as reliable, but those gaps are being closed.Enemy AI: Decent, but has some areas that need work in terms of aggressiveness, spacing, and attack timing/strategy in order to make a really compelling swordfighting title. But, that's on the roadmap, so that's good.Visual/interactivity polish: Not bad. Voiceover needs a rework and there's not much in terms of introducing new players to the game (you start the game, and there you are with a menu and some basic info), but I personally don't care all that much about anything beyond core gameplay.For reference, this is my current ranking of satisfying sword combat experiences (asterisks mark games I haven't played but listing is based on my impressions from video reviews / other games) and my impression of what direction these games are going in the ranking (+ for 'rising', - for 'falling', = for 'no change'):1) Sword Master VR (-)2) Vanishing Realms (-)3) Tie: Gladius (+) / GORN (+)4) Spell Fighter (-)5) True Blades* (= / +, unsure)6) Deus Vult (+)7) Titan Slayer (=)8) Sairento (=)9) Raw Data (=)10) Are there other swordfighting games worth mentioning as of May 31 2017? (I'm seriously asking)For $10, buy it, for sure."

Yes, it's still got a few kinks that need ironing out but the developer is very active in addressing these issues with updates and great support.  This game is good now, however, it won't be long until this game is great if the improvements keep coming - it could eventually turn out to be the number 1 sword fighting game for the Vive/Rift!"

Very physically active and you really get the 'thrill of the fight' in this game.The arena is great - even just the training - I haven't actually progressed to the campaign yet! There is a great amount of content and replay-ability here.The recent addition of chariot racing is really nice and completely unexpected - I recommend using the 'advanced' dual mode for immersion. Control each of your horses individually and winning takes actual skill. New in depth features are being added fairly regularly in addition to balance and useability tweaks - clearly a very active and passionate dev.The game is not polished to a very high level particularly in the menus but a large variety of control schemes are supported and the graphical, audio and gameplay are finished off to a high standard. Make sure to set up your control scheme in the menus at the beginning to avoid utter confusion as to how to drop or pick up objects etc - once you know how you've set it up it works great.At this price it would seriously be a crime not to own this game."

You could say the combat is a combonation of Vanishing Realms & Gorn. Its early access but coming along nicely.  I highly recommend opting into the beta and enabling the experimetnal physics grip.This game also has many different weapons and shields to choose from so it is more than just a sword fighting game.  I prefer to fight in the arena rather than the games. I hope the developers add more mythical monsters like the minotaur which is pretty awesome since its so oversized.

Over a couple of months I've seen a lot of small changes, with the addition of a few big ones.I'm not saying this game doesn't need some tweaking, as it most certainly does, but I am saying the dev is listening and actively working on the game, taking player suggestions heavily in to consideration...But for the game itself, the combat has become MUCH more fluid since I first started playing, and nothing makes me feel more bad♥♥♥♥♥than a block in to a pirouette landing the final strike on to a giant FREAKING MINOTAUR!!  The first time fighting this thing I was so immersed I stepped back, and tried to dig my heels in to my carpet... Not to mention the brief sense of fear when they release the lions...

I want a realistic gladiator feeling not clash of the titans so a simple ""Dissable fantasy enemies"" would be a nice option.--Now there are quite ""few"" weapons but it's a work in progress so i wont mention that or the other things that is in the roadmap made by the devs.--Pros:Chop off limbs.Thats about it.It's truly a magical feeling killing people in vr upclose and personal.Send help.This game is a freaking workout at times."

76561198142819669,Recommended,556640,28533342,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,plano,"Updated Review with Patch 1.10Gladius has seen a very significant gameplay update recently with patch 1.10 and now I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a decent sword fighting game (+ has a bow & arrow part as well!).The main changes to the gameplay that has elevated this game from crappy swordplay to one of the better melee fighting games are:- Better AI: the enemy is now more aggressive, circles you and keeps a more sensible distance- Better hitboxes: while there are sometimes still some issues, it has improved tremendously. Now it feels at least on par with Vanishing Realms, if not even better. Compared to Swordmaster VR, in this game you are actually able to slash enemies reliably without feeling your hits don't register.- Better animations: the enemy behaves more dynamically; the blending between the different animation states still needs some improvement, however, in its current iteration it is already sufficient for fun gameplayThe game is a lot of fun, challenging and has climbed for me to the top of swordfighting games out there. While it lacks the physicality of GORN, it surpasses Swordmaster VR by a mile gameplay and content wise.Thumbs up from me and if you look at the updates that have been pushed out, this is a good early access game where the developer is regularly improving the game and listens to feedback.This is one of the best VR swordfighting games out there.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Below my old negative review for posterity's sake, most of the things I've complained about below have been fixed/improved.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I really can't understand how this game got so many positive reviews. This game tries to put you in the shoes of a gladiator with several unlockable weapons, missions with various enemies and 3 difficulty settings per mission.HOWEVER, the biggest problem with this game is, that it is simply not fun due to a really bad implementation of sword play. Your sword can phase through all the enemies, there is no physical collision that happens, and this leads to extremely bad hit boxes for the enemies. You are able to hit them all through their shield with no repercussions.The collision system in general is very wonky. Just being close to the enemy will trigger a flurry of clangs even without moving an inch. It looks like the game thinks when your shield or your sword is close to the enemy, that there is some contact done. If your shield clips through the enemy's shield (which happens very often due to the iffy animations), it will results into a ear-deafing cascade of several collisions occuring in like 1 second.While there are different enemies, any armor they are wearing makes no difference in hitting them. A almost naked gladiator dies as quickly as a fully armored legionnaire.The animations are pre-canned and both look and feel bad. The enemy often tries to clip through you, ignoring any kind of geometry. Even your shield! They don't try to actively or reactively move where you try to strike them down, instead they stay in their idle position, only to attack or wait to get slaughtered by your shield-piercing sword.You can waggle your sword and most enemies will simply lose one of their limbs or even their head. Hit detection is incredibly bad, sometimes hitting their legs won't lead to any damage, sometimes you just craze their shoulder and their whole arm flies off a few yards.If you have played a few other melee VR games, here some direct comparison:Did you like the combat in Vanishing Realms but felt it was a little bit too floaty? Then this game is much worse, everything is extremely floaty and you don't feel like hitting the enemies nor getting hit at your shield. The sound FX are very weak and the collision and hitbox system doesn't allow for any precision strikes, just clipping through each other instead of fighting.Did you like Swordmaster VR but felt the hitboxes are sometimes off and only thrusting works? Then this game won't be for you. You hit the enemies here very inconsistently, and sometimes just kill them by grazing your sword lightly at any extremity.Did you like Gorn and how the combat felt impactful? You won't get any of that here. The gameplay videos are very misleading, as the gore factors here don't seem to depend that much where you cut the enemy. If you hit their head somehow, the whole head will go flying off the neck. It doesn't fit with where you strike. Additionally, you won't feel like you are even hitting anything than thin air.This game commits most mistakes that other sword fighting games already did and doesn't deliver its promise for an immersive sword fighting game. It doesn't even come close to ""realistic"" sword fighting as it tries to advertise in one of its key points in the description in the game (e.g. ""seek openings in their armor and defenses and strike back"" does it say, but armor doesn't change the hitboxes at all!). Don't buy this game if you expect good gameplay. Not worth any cents as of right now."

Trackpad control is my preference and is a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this game. With speed maxed you still move at a crawl. Decided to give it another try with sprint movement and found it a bit less tedious. Also, there is bullet time, not that you'd know from the game. There needs to be some sort of graphical telegraphing of the bullet time effect. I'd go with desaturation of the colors. Or hypersaturation. Either could denote a state of hightened attention.Food often falls through the fall when dropped into the arena and requires a free hand to pick up when it doesn't. With how fiddly the weapon bindings are I reckon just walking over it to consume would be better.Archers are tedious as ♥♥♥♥, constantly back-peddling on you. Also, do we really have to have women? I ♥♥♥♥ing hate killing women. Feels gross.Also, it crashes on exit, but that's kind of par for the course for early access.Complaints aside, once you start spamming the bullet time power it's a pretty fun game. Dumped my shield in favor of a second weapon an enemy had dropped, and with well timed time-slows I got through the first day.Weapons have some physicallity, but your own weapons will clip through each other. It seems the safer choice, but after playing the Parry and Riposte tech demo with fully physicallized weapons and shields I think it's the way of the future for VR melee games.Between the days and the survival mode, and with the unlockable gear there's already a good amount of content there, especially at the price."

,Not Recommended,556640,31068186,Posted: 10 April,all,Foxx ♠,"As of current state, I do not recommend this game. Unless you have a craving for melee games and do not care to have a glitchy game, pass this one. I might be expecting a tad more being a passionnate about martial arts and sword related arts, but still an honest review nonetheless.Now, it's an early stage product, but also most early release games just end up never fixing half of their bugs and just run away with the money. So I'd hold off on buying until we can be sure that the bugs will be fixed. Because some of the stuff I describe right there is stuff that feels like it should already fixed by early release, like poor alignement with the shields, some weird hitboxes or gliding ennemies.The rest of the message is adressed mostly to the devsIssues:-Blocking attacks is random:---Blocking low attacks with shield is stubborn and not working often---Blocking without a shield feels random. Often, attacks I was sure I blocked seemed to pass right through and hit me anyway. It feels sometimes like the hitbox of my character is bigger than the length of my arms.-Inventory is glitchy. Sometimes, the weapons you store on your hips become invisible. The helmet system is mysterious at best.-No animation blending? Jumping straight from one attack animation to another is like fighting against naruto. Feints or correct HEMA/medieval hard to blocks attack would be fine, but having irrealistic attacks just played fast and with no animation blending doesn't feel like a good way to achieve challenge.-You cannot get close to your opponents. If you do, he just gets pushed away and slides on the ground. By itself, it's kinda lame. But it's even worse when you realize you can punch your opponents. Why if you never can have the reach?EDIT: If you play with the trackpad, you're going to be ♥♥♥♥ed when you have to fight without a weapon, due to the issue mentioned above... Wich happened on the 3rd level of the easy mode, day one. Stripped of your weapons. Good luck. If you don't play with the trackpad, you can cheat spamming the teleport to kill them with your fists.-Picking weapons from your hips in the eh, sticky mode was it? it often just falls off from your hand as soon as you release the grip. Hilarious the first 2 times when your sword flies off mid fight. Still an issue.EDIT: Actually not ""often"", but 100% of the time. In sticky mode, the weapon will not stay in your hand. You have to remove it from your hips, let it fall, THEN pick it up if you want to use itMinor annoyances:-moving... with... the.... track... pad... is... slow... the armory is like 10km long, but I got to move like a snail?EDIT: So you can make the trackpad speed a bit faster! Just noticed.-No warning of when the slow motion ends... And when it goes back to real speed it comes REALLY fast at you.I must state that I really want to like this game and I hope the devs will keep working on it and those will get solved!"

The game just isn't that fun.I'll try it again, and maybe my review will change.The current Overall ""Mixed"" review is very appropriate for this game."

I have a 980Ti and have purchased many VR titles; this is the first one I have had refunded due to performance.I will say that of the 11 minutes I played, I collision detection is pretty good and the visuals are better than a lot of titles I've experienced.If the performance issues are improved I may reconsider, but until then I cannot recommend this game."
76561197971169688,Not Recommended,556640,28632349,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Sp00derman,"Played for about 20 minutes. It was enough to see that this isnt quite ready to compete with other sword combat games available (specifically SwordMaster VR, Vanishing Realms and Gorn). The graphics are very good, but the feel of combat and lack of fluidity to enemy animations lets it down at the moment. For example, in Gorn, even though the controls are less complex, I still have more options in combat by way of grabbing and throwing my weapons intuitively. (and I can bang my sword against my shield! How was this overlooked in a Rome-themed setting?) Enemies in Gladius lack weight at the moment, something that only be experienced, not seen in the trailers. In SwordMaster, the enemies though limited in variety, attack, block, parry in a way that is realistic, and the extremely limited space forces you to take advantage of roomscale movement in a satisfying way. The large arena of gladius, while spectacular, lacks the intimacy of combat by way of being able to move around in ways the AI cant quite keep up with. I refunded, but will follow this game to see how it develops. TL;DR: This game is a less polished, more ambitious sword combat game that doesnt quite match its counterparts in the main way that matters: immersive melee combat. Try swordmaster or GORN first."

This game suffers from huge bugs like a tiger I was fighting flying into 2d crowd and getting stuck from a swing to just having an awful combat engine. This game is just an arena game, but can't even get that right. It makes the combat engine in Vanishing Realms seem like a tripple A game. It would make an ok free title, but as it is I can't recommend this to anyone."
76561198036002101,Not Recommended,556640,28606435,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,The Red Hood,"I'm hoping to god that this game gets better, because I absolutely love the idea of arena combat in VR like this. Gorn is a very good example of what I mean.The problems with this game, like much of the sword play games in VR: hit detection is very bad. I put it on the easiest difficulty, walked up to a guy and just went mad with slashing - not a single hit when I was a few inches away from him.Besides this, it is just not very fun - this is the problem with wave-types like this and Sword Master VR, there is no fun in sword play which just isn't right. There is no dynamic, I can't find myself interested when I slash repeatedly at a guys face and he just slashes once, misses me by a mile but one hits me and I die instantly.I know, it's early access but for the current price tag this game is not worth it. I would pay five dollars at most for what this game is, essentially a wave based sword play game (too many examples of this already in the VR world.)So please dev, the work this game needs most at the moment is hit collision - it's pretty ridiculous. Perhaps some more added concepts that make it more special than just any wave slasher.I won't refund for now, in hopes for the better game."
