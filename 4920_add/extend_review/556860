,Recommended,556860,30284418,Posted: 2 March,all,Cyborg,"Game is surprisingly fun for how basic it is, although 10 bucks seems a bit expenive for the same simplistic reason. This last update is bulls**t however. Before, you could pick what moves your gladiator did in the arena. Now it's ""advanced AI"" just does it's ultimate until your stamina is completely drained. Matches that should only take 3 moves to win now take 20 and I get to the point of wanting to throw my computer at a wall.I still recommend this game, but get your sh*t together Raptor Claw."

There have been games that almost scratch the itch to run a gladiator school but, they all fell short in certain aspects. This game, while it may have its flaws, is an early access game with a lot to show for already! There is pretty fun controlling of the gladiator's lives, combat, and things that they do outside of your school. I personally enjoy this game very much and would recommend it to anyone looking to have some fun with gladiators. Since this game is actually and early access game, it gives me hope that there can be even more great things to do in this game. I hope that they come up with great additions to the game and listen to their customers about other things that should be implemented as well. While this game is quite good, I believe that it could be a lot better if they fix a few bugs like not being able to send your guard to do anything in the school and the workout schedule not working right. We all know that these things will certainly be fixed soon and when those things are fixed the game will be even better!I really enjoy this game but I believe that there are some things that could make it better. While these things aren't needed to make the game good in anyway, seeing them introduced would definitely be a welcomed sight!Skip things like waking into arena and seeing rewards from battles.Kick people out of their rooms so another person can live there.Send people to bed to get them well rested.A real market that you can visit at any time to buy or sell weapons and armor, food, wood, and slaves.Allow us to destroy built things like rooms and equipment.There should be public punishments like whipping the slaves to boost the morale of everyone.Allow the AI to surrender in combat when they have low health instead of just getting killed.A worshipping system would be amazing but only if you feel up to it. We really don't need it in the game. With this system, the player will be able to make offerings of blood or gold in order to make the gods happy and get better results in the arena."

If they fix the constant crashes every 10 or so minutes, and the minor bugs(They are more annoying than gamebreaking, you just have to reload the game.) Then this game would be my favorite game ever.Best gladiator managment game ever.Overall 8/10 in my book.This game could go places. ;)Correction: I just managed two hours without the game crashing."

,Recommended,556860,34314717,Posted: 17 August,all,DevilMire HellsBane,"I have played this game for a few hours, getting used to how it works and I like the idea of how you can do all this, However, the automated training could be better by adding what you want them to train in, or add how high you want them to train in it. This would allow it to be a sort of smooth transition and let all those in the school to get the training they need over all. If they reach you, you can reset it and put it higher to allow them to keep going, or leave them low levels and work with it from there. Another thing that would work to be added if having them automatically go into the hot bath when they are completely out of stamina. That way, you could focus more on the training instead of always needing to click all over to get them where you need them to. Even Idle, the jobs tend to drain the stamina quite a lot so it would keep them on tract with going forward and working while you train your fighters up. I definitely recomend it, but there is a lot to improve. I do understand it's early access, so I am giving some ideas that might be useful over all."

Give them some time and I'm sure these devs will bring you a great game. Yes there are some issues but It's early access and I'm excited for this game to grow.
,Recommended,556860,28276271,"Posted: 9 December, 2016",all,BinaryEX4,"Edit:- Changing review to a positive. Had to reBuy the game, maybe i just didnt give it a chance....... Please please do a full tutorial or at least put out a video tutorial for this game.The game has a lot of potential and i look forward to future developments. Without a tutorial this game will confuse alot of customers.I recommend this game now as i can see it could become very addictive and in depth! Once you get to know how to start off and make some money and win a few fights it becomes fun looking after your gladiators and progressing them up the ranks to harder and harder fights... Worth a look if your into this type of game.OLD REVIEW BELOWHad to unfortunately refund this game. The game in its current state is broken and unplayable. After a few minutes of play the buttons on screen become un-clickable. Has this game undergone any testing????? this should of been fixed before alpha release.Because of above i gave a neg review - However.........The concept is good, was looking forward to the release of this game and as such was a major disappointment due to its being broken.Please fix and keep working on it, and this review becomes an easy positive. I can see how this game could become very addicting."

I would definitely recommend this game for anyone looking for a tycoon biased strategy game, or anyone  who enjoys gladiator combat. Although the game is a lot of fun, it still needs some more content. Basically, there is not a large amount of things to do, and you can dominate the game very quickly. Other than that, the game is really fun and really beautifully designed. I give a lot of props to the creators who have tried to bring black gladiators in a fun ""farm-tycoon"" sort of way. You should really give this game a try!"

,Not Recommended,556860,30572407,Posted: 17 March,all,MostBlunted,"It´s not really much fun and very repetitive. Fights can last for like 4-5min and you can´t do anything in a fight but watch them, the AI is stupid in the fights. If your opponent has 0 stamina, he can´t block or attack. But still your own fighter decides to block (an attack which will never happen because the opponent can´t attack with 0 stamina) instead of getting the free hit. This is just very stupid game design. I´ve only played like 70min and I was already bored doing the same stuff over and over again.1) Train X2) Go to Bath3) Train X4) Go to Bath5) Train X6) Sleep7) Cook some meals8) Train X9) Go to Bath10) Fight a battle11) Train X12) Go to Bath13) Sleep14) Cook some mealsrepeat foreverSound like fun doesnt it?"

Most of the time, clicking doesn't do anything. Your units do not do anything when you tell them too, and it isn't because they are low on mood or whatever. Sometimes the game just gives up, and all orders stop working, except putting the gladiators in jail. Won't let me build,  train or work on the craft workshop area.This game needs A LOT of work, to make the game stable enough to  even be tested properly by players. Once the devs have managed to do that, maybe it   will be something interestting .The game needs A LOT of new features in addition to functionality of the barebones features currently in the game.I would say this game is not work the risk right now, as I do not have the greatest of confidence the game will ever be finished to a satisfactory state. Be very wary, check out Gladiator Trainer if you want a gladiator type game, although it is quite a bit different, it will quench your gladiator itch, should you have one, a lot better than this one will, and it will do so for many, MANY months before this one ever will."

We will see if they redeem themselves from the mess in Raptor's prior title that really screwed and scammed the community. Normally no one will get second chances once they offend many as they did in their last, but they did learn from their mistakes as they shared with us when we gave them an untrusting review.We since have watched their progress and now deserve the thunbs up.This game certainly has come along nicely, redeeming the group of its last diabolical mess with their last title from Raptor Claw, and it seems they will finish this title.As long as they continue the great work, we now will recommend this game as it seems they have learned from their prior mistakes. So far they have added a steady update stream as well provide good community response.If they keep this up, this will be a well apprecaited title and get their name out of the poo box.Keep up the good work guys.
