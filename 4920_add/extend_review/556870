,Not Recommended,556870,30092145,Posted: 21 February,all,Aramax,"When I open the game it is called SpaceeZombies and not Charlie's Adventure. The game probably changed name during production but someone who had to change this detail didn't do his job... I guess this explains a lot of thing about this game.First thing first, if you are a game developer and feel the need to create some platformer style game like this one, make sure  to center properly the action on the character that the player is going to play with and refrain from making some ""half-baked"" setup that makes the screen jerk right, left, up and down every time you jump a little bit too far making the game practically impossible to enjoy... It's annoying.Second thing, do not overload the screen with visual content that hide the character when you go forward or other foreground elements that we can live without... It is not needed.Third thing, do not add cannons and turrets just for the sake of adding some weird difficulty layer to your game if it does not make any shred of sense... It is illogical.Finally, do not attempt to burn the retina of the players by overusing bloom and light effects... It burns.I will conclude this review by saying that I understand that this game was a labor of love for whoever made it but I wonder if you had more fun creating or contemplating the end result."

,Not Recommended,556870,30630520,Posted: 19 March,all,nujumkey,"When you start the game its default state is the highest resolution and there is no way to change this once you enter a level. This caused my cutscenes to glitch out super hard and lag the entire first two levels before i realized the problem. If you want to play this game, change the settings to something appropriate to your system. SETTINGS ARE NOT SAVED BETWEEN PLAY SESSIONS.I'm just going to list off all my problems i ran into with the game. Its not the worse game i've ever played, theres a good bit of variety and content in here, but these issues kept me from sticking with the game.The game is a pretty linear platformer that has no real branching paths. It gives you attacks like dashes, a ground pound, and a gun. The gun is so much stronger than the rest of your weapons theres no reason to use anything else, especially because the movement feels weird and makes landing dashes and groundpounds akward. The camera moves around wildly, partially i think because of the jump height. They made your character rather small on screen, and to help the player move around that screen your player has a massive jump height. This makes some sequences a bit hard to track and i ended up pausing the game a bunch to try and get a better sense of where i was going. The jumping itself moves a bit more than i would like and the speed combined with the rough camera means that it's hard to judge exactly where you will land. Also a minor annoyance was that i ran into a glitch where a zombie was standing on a fire that was supposed to kill it, and you can't progress in the game until every zombie is killed. The art in the backgrounds is similar to art in the foreground and sometimes, especially with tree branches, it's hard to tell which part you're supposed to jump on.That's all my complaint. Honestly the game is alright, and these devs have made a lot of stuff that i like so i'll try to stick with it a little longer, but personally i wouldn't recommend this game to anyone given the plethora of good platformers/brawlers on steam."

,Recommended,556870,30867250,Posted: 31 March,all,Gone2Lake,"For $.51 you can't really go wrong with this fun little platformer.  It's challenging on the highest difficulty but not as challenging as something like Spelunky, for example.  Graphics are nice, I've had no performance issues, no glitches or bugs while playing.  It's stable, it's FUN, and it's very inexpensive.  Give it a shot if you like platformer type games.  I've had a blast with it, more fun than some titles that are $59.99"

76561198041769504,Recommended,556870,30693885,Posted: 23 March,all,XCaffeinated,"Casual platformer.Full disclaimer: I'm not really a platformer person. I tend more towards FPSs (DOOM) and ARPGs (Dark Souls) so maybe not the best person to review.That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this.Gameplay is fairly well balanced, with a good range of weapons, and difficulty. Fun achievements; nothing impossible. Decent stage variety (e.g, stages with only a few enemies but harder terrain/traps, lots of enemies spread out, lots of platforms (teeter totters, moving islands) where the point is to go find the enemies). Checkpoint distance varies, but is never too far apart (ok, maybe3rd stage of level 10, which was an utter gangbang, but apart from that...).There are no really impossible-to-make timing moves or jumps, and the level design is never unfair/mean-spirited, meaning that if you miss a jump (even on the teeter-totters) you generally wind up not dying (apart from some obvious traps). Though some of the star placements are a bit sadistic.The animations cracked me up, and are the reason I bought it (coupon from badge crafting, but honestly it's worth the full 4 bucks). And ok, there are some spelling errors in the UI, but somehow that just adds to the silliness. You do this insane cackle every time you get health too, which just never gets old. Soundtrack fits in well.Couple of weird glitches: flying axes(?); floating platform on level 10 seems to hover for about 10 seconds before moving; you very occasionally get stuck somewhere and have to reload the level.Two warnings: 1) If you start a game on one difficulty and then start a new game on another difficulty, you lose the current game, so complete that playthrough first. 2) If you are in the middle of a level and you exit, you have to replay the whole level, there are no save slots. The levels aren't that long though.Recommended."

,Recommended,556870,29996804,Posted: 17 February,all,TheColdAge,"A good platform game with basic controls. As far is I haver gotten I've seen 4 enemies the basher, the thrower, the mad bomber and the healer. There also are different kind of traps layout through each lvl like a cannon ball shooter, a bow and arrow that aim where you are moving to and an axe that swing from left to right. So far, the only real issue I have with this game is the bugs that sometimes happen in those lvl like an axe that move out of it's place, The platform that suddenly go diagonal instead of horizontal.The checkpoint system is OK and you frequently get same hitpoints back by defeating zombies.All in all I would recommend this game for the fair price it offers since it give you a fair ammount of gameplay. I think this game would give you around 3-7 hours of gameplay which is more than enough to justify it's value."
