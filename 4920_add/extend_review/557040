I love Streets of Rage and Double Dragon and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Those games were great. And if you're a fan of those games, you won't be disappointed by this one. The fighting is frantic. The animation is great. The level art is fantastic. There's an amazing variety of characters (which i love) and plenty of moves to keep your thumbs busy. In fact, I'll even go so far as to say this is right now the best 2d side scrolling beat-em-up on Steam right now. I really like it!A few other things I like. The levels are long and littered with weapons and health. There is also a good variety of enemies, some of which require a little different strategy to take on. The game also has a decent sense of humor, similar to Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Also, it has local co-op which is great when you want to play with a friend. And you'll probably need to, because the game is challenging.There's no tutorial, so you'll have to figure out the moves on your own. For a veteran like me, that wasn't a problem, but I can't help but think there might be more here that I'm missing.I'm totally happy I picked this up and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the genre or action games in general."

The only saving grace this game had was the soundtrack, but Streets of Rage it is not! A limited and uninspired set of moves make it all very repetitive and bland when it could have been so much more, it just becomes a chore very quickly. I put my first Steam refund to good use!"
,Not Recommended,557040,33489065,Posted: 12 July,all,kikind3840,"I really wanted to like this game, but in the end of the day, I cant recommend this game to anyone. The developers had agreat idea with a great art style and a good soundtrack. This game looks good. Characters have interesting powers, there's a combo system that is simple yet rewarding a decent upgrade system.So why can't I recommend this game?Simple, the developers knew how to nail the look of a great brawler, but it appears they never figured out how one worked. Its like they never bothered play testing it with anyone other than themselves, and even then only after they had some cheat codes in. The gameplay on normal mode is beyond frustrating, and even on easy I find myself wanting to throw my controller. So we'll list out the major issues that cause this game to go from elevated greatness to dumpster fire after the opening sequence.1. Enemy grabbing: Players can grab enemies in this game. Thats a usual thing in these types of games, in some games SPECIAL enemies can grab the player. In this game, every enemy can and will grab you and take a good 1/4 of your life on normal and just under a quarter on easy. Most enemies in this game have a go to move of just continually grabbing the player. It s one of the most frustrating things in this game. Not every enemy in a game should be able to grab you continually.2. Enemy combos: You get caught in one, your done. A group of enemies get on you, your dead. Every enemy in the game is super aggressive regardless of difficulty. Enemies on normal will swar and stomp your face in like you were on the hardest difficulty on a regular game.3. Speed: Your character is always slower than every enemy so an enemy will almost always punch you before you punch them. The only way to never get hit is to jump into every enemy because if you even try to walk up to them, you will usually immediately get grabbed or combo'd.4. Enemy aggressiveness: On normal, every enemy runs at you full throttle swinging. they will constantly hit you with dash attacks and frustrate you to no end with how little chance they give you to do anything other than die.5. Suicide Attacks: Basically this is what I call an attack that hurts your character when you do it. This was a stupid and bad game mechanic in the 90's, its not gotten any less stupid with age. This is generally how you know if your going into a bad brawler these days. If your character has an attack that hurts them, usually the game sucks (not always (TMNT)). It means the developer didnt know what they were doing with the attacks.Overall I can only suggest you play something better and see what Beat'em Ups done correctly look like, because this isnt it. If the developer cared, they could easily fix this game, and move it into greatness, but I doubt they do. Go play something better: Scott Pilgrim Vs the World, Double Dragon Neon, TMNT 3: Turtles in Time, Foul Play, or Castle Crashers.To the Developers: How to fix your game:1. Lower enemy aggressiveness. Play the games I mentioned above and notice how often and what types of attacs are generally used by enemies.2. Raise character attack speed or make it so their striking has a slightly further reach, this can balance enemies striking players problem.3. Remove the rebound from the suicide attacks. Having these attacks as free use until the super hard difficulty will make it easier for more casual players to get into and enjoy this game. Look at TMNT 3 for an example of why these attacks are stupid in the first place. If you want to keep players from spamming the attack, create an energy bar that refills slowly for that specific attack. Seriously, play TMNT 3 and tell me how often you used the suicide attack in there."

Side-scroller that starts simple with just enemies to punch/kick to knock them out. However, there is progression with your character and there are combos to learn to get through the more difficult levels."

Playing this just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, to be honest, so I'm just going to list why it pisses me off without any order; I can't even make a well written passage about it. (I suppose I can't really blame the game on that though, I'm just lazy...)You can play similar games of better quality for free on flash game portals. The upgrades are just damage increases, so no real depth there, as ""Fries"" you can just spam the dash strong move most of the time and win, enemies will attack you from the edge of the screen, the weird isometric sidescrolling perspective makes it so being sure you will grab or even just hit an enemy impossible, not to mention the fact that it uses the antiquated mechanic of walking towards an enemy to grab. It means if you want to jump and attack while enemies are near you, there's a good chance you'll just grab one and do a special/desperation attack, using health. Most of the challenge can be avoided by spamming jump attacks, the aforementioned dash move, and buying tons of lives in between levels. There isn't any interesting decision to be made about using your special attack; you are forced to use it anytime you are hit, because otherwise, you'll lose a ridiculous amount of health because of the hitstun you're put in by enemies (so they combo the crap out of you). I would also appreciate if an option to mute just the character sound bytes was available, because each character only seems to have about 4-5 and they all make my ears bleed with how annoying they are. Enemy grabs are un-counterable, as far as I can tell. Boss fights boil down to this: run away, get hit, use special attack for invincibility, boss becomes vulnerable, mash attack until they snap out of it and immediately hit you without any visual/aural que, hit with super (doesn't even require any aim, you just press the super button), repeat until dead.Basically, the game feels like a chore to play, due to antiquated mechanics/controls, easy first order optimal strategies that destroy any feeling of challenge or mastery, and a style that seems like it's trying too hard to be self-aware, or something (oh, and it has characters that yell in the same fashion everytime you do certain attacks, complete with bad sound quality). If you want a beat 'em up with fun combos that don't amount to button mashing, avoidable hazards and attacks, an interesting atmosphere/aesthetic/story, or anything else of value, don't buy this.Ok, I realize I'm being dramatic, but I seriously thought this was going to be more than a shallow button-mash fest. So most of the anger is dissapointment. I also realize that the isometric weirdness couldn't have been a surprise (it's in the trailer after all), and that my gripes about the aesthetics are subjective, but this just doesn't have interesting systems or satisfying gameplay to back it up. I can live with an imperfect game. This just fails in all the wrong places for me, I suppose. Proceed with caution."

76561198272980979,Not Recommended,557040,33757599,Posted: 23 July,all,exsnuggly,"I hate to give this a thumbs down but its not worth 12 bucks i heasitated and bought it on sell and i'm glade i did. These type of games was all i use to play thats why its so sad. The thinking to this game is what bought it down. Here we go,  enemies run behind the scene was an old complaint and they dare do it here that was the first strike, characters are ugly and very unapealing 2. the costumes not even worth a laugh 3. upgrades are not worth it and expensive 4, animation was too little and/or just ok 5 no reason to go on they should have thought it through. Main stream gamers are the largest community of gaming industry so with all the unfunny lame goofy stuff they did they missed the biggest money community in gaming. Goofyness rarely do well in gameing 99 vides should have made it a lot more 18 then anything. Well guess i should mention the combat I guess. The punch to kick combos are ok but you have to buy them. The enemies get stronger but your character stays the same. You'll find yourself spaming the same move in later stages just to get through the stage o well 5 out of 10. action fighter fans (beat em up fans) will be ok with it every one else will hate it"
,Not Recommended,557040,33899832,Posted: 30 July,all,chewfeather,"It's a very mixed bag. The English isn't perfect, but some of the writing is surprisingly witty. Obvious effort was taken in some parts of the visual presentation, but other animations look really sub-par. There's some good creativity in its boss-design, but most of the combat is repetitive and devolves quickly into a one-size-fits-all cheesing strategy. Having another local-multiplayer game to try with friends is great, but that feeling's lessened when it's a game you'll easily beat within your first few hours of trying it.Between the positives and negatives, it comes down to price. At a lower cost its faults might be more forgivable but this doesn't have the level of finish I would expect for a $13 game."
76561198300884596,Not Recommended,557040,35218454,Posted: 26 September,all,mongoosedave2,"Shows promise at first but then spirals into disaster the more you play it. All 4 characters feel too similar thus making them lack a unique style from one another. You unlock characters by beating the game but the first 4 you unlock are just clones of the starting 4, so you really get nothing. I haven't unlocked the other 3 because I just don't have the patience and I don't have fun when playing.When first starting out you're pathetically unequipped to be able to beat the game. So you may be forced to keep playing the first 2 levels, including the bonus level in order to farm points for upgrades. Do this until you have all of them and then spend points on extra lives (you'll need them thanks to the game's severe lack of balance).The player characters are all slower than the enemies when it comes to attacking so you'll see yourself constantly getting beat out. Little to no crowd control so swarms of enemies will easily overwhelm you. Long stunlock when attacked so unless you use the crowd clear attack (which costs HP to use) you'll just get stunlocked to death.Worst bosses I've seen in a while. None of them are enjoyable to fight. They all have some kind of set pattern that you have to play along with before they can be opened up for a few combos before they go right back to the pattern. The only exception is the first phase of the final boss which has no opening for combos. He just spams projectiles at you and never gets stunlocked. So you're forced to either play hit-and-run or throw your extra lives at him and take the hits until you win.I had high hopes when first playing the game because it was giving off vibes of Streets of Rage. But it looks like the developers don't understand what makes beat'em ups fun like Bomber Games do. It's fun to learn how enemies behave and use the tools you're given to have total control over fights. It's fun to learn the combat system to your advantage. It's fun to use different characters and be forced to play differently. It's not fun to feel totally helpless during fights because enemies are faster, have no recovery time from attacks, block most attacks, and gang up on you.  Nor is it fun to try a different character only to realize he plays almost exactly the same with only slight differences in special attacks.The only positives I have is that the game looks pretty and the music is pretty good. AVoid this game; there are better beat'em ups available on steam or download Streets of Rage Remake for free."

In the first level you're attacked from enemies off screen several times. And the fact that enemies can block attacks but from what I could tell you can not just makes the game feel broken.
