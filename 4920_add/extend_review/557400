Idle game at its finest.10/10 would make gold again.Edit after 270+ hours: Not like the others, this one kept me around this far and seems like I am going way beyond that.There is always something you want to achiev and lot things to do , even tho there is a lot of grind walls, it gives you some ways around it if you plan yourself to.You can assume it rewards some tactics to advance faster (sometimes WAY faster) than the normal, like combo raid loots with some well thought diamond/knowledge researches that you did at the right time, and also with the right reset to get the right ammount of diamonds..Wont spoil it so go on and think about the tactics for yourself, its fun and rewarding when you find it. And I didnt even unlocked the Midaeum yet, nor the war outpost.It also has a mix of click, idle and combo points that change with the champion you unlock after earn some x of gold.So much content and progression done the right way without everwhelming you. Plus the devs are constant updating some little things to improve the game that I can call the most strategical game of all clickers/idles haha.. love it."

Midas Gold Plus is so deep with restart systems, leveling up of skills and characters, raids, bonuses, boosts, etc, that it just pleases the player, left right and center.A new reason to sit at the computer and lose yourself in a gameI've been at the computer for a pretty lengthy time, already today, just leveling up stats, buying upgrades, and watching the gold come flying in. Even better, when I'm out and about, I am actually excited to come back and see what my idle time has unlocked and opened in the game. The fact is, the feedback loop of this game is extremely intelligent in that it rewards the player in very positive ways.Rewarding experiences for different play stylesAs you play the game, you begin to unlock advisors which have bonuses that you can use during your play. In the beginning, there are two, one rewards you with bonuses for clicking, one rewards you with idle bonuses. Later in the game (I've yet to unlock more) there are advisors with even stranger skill sets. You can change your advisor on the fly, so if you're at the computer, select the guy with skills that reqard clicking, if you go out, select the one who rewards idle time.It's painless and easy to switch advisors, and each time you switch, you have a bunch of new bonuses and boosts to use your money on to upgrade.A must download for clicker fansThis game is free. Simply put, even without paying a single penny, you'll enjoy this game if you enjoy clicker games. It's simply just perfectly thought out, very rewarding, and progresses at a wonderful pace, whether you pay real money or not.Additionally, if you DO decide to pay real money, the packages are very fairly priced, and the ""Hot Deals"" packages are fantastic bonuses that supercharge the gameplay from the get-go.If you are a fan of clicker games, and you are on the fence about this game, take it from me. It's well designed, rewarding, deep as the sea, and fantastic fun.Quit reading this review and download the damn game, for goodness sakes. Geesh, some people take so much convincing..."

In the beginning things go slow and after a few hours you will be repeating everything you did before.The more you play the more things you can upgrade and the faser you make money. When you finally reach a 100Qa Diamonds it really feels like you are playing a different game which is even more awesome :DDont give up after a few hours of playing, hang in there and eventually you will get rewarded!!Check out the Steam discussions for tips, hints or if you encounter problems."
,Recommended,557400,30180549,Posted: 25 February,all,Löwe,"Pros- If you liked adventure capitalist you will love this, it is much deeper and there is more to do- The developer is very generous with in game currency, you get around 5 dollars worth a week just for daily log ins- Even the automation is more strategically involved and there can be a huge income gap between two players at the same level- The active abilities system feels great in an idle game- There is a consumable system that feels like a rush when you activate a few boosts- Music is greatCons- Art style and ""graphics"" may turn some people off, but I imagine they will improve with time.- Progress can feel sluggish around the 1 Trillion diamond mark- There is a large benefit to leaving the game running at all times, which uses cpu and impacts performence of other games.Overall I would recommend this game to anyone, give it a try and you might get hooked like I did."

The stone clicks are worth a pittance compared to the idle collection from buildings, even after only a few levels of research into the idle collection. I still have a long way to go to see a lot more of the game, but it seems good so far."

76561198035383340,Recommended,557400,29787845,Posted: 8 February,all,Polichaos,"GOLD. It's the first thing you think of when you here MIDAS. Well Midas Gold Plus is just that, making gold by touching ''whatever'' with your blessed hands from the gods. Everything you touch turns to gold, so start making an awesome civilization and get rich and powerful? eh? I think that was the plan in the orginal myth, but he dies or worse like any greek tragedy... Anywho here you do click rocks to make gold and start leveling up a little village set up, to become a major powerful kingdom. A clicker/idle game- its just profiting and reaching high gold production rates with your villages sawmill, ranger guild, barracks and such. More gold unlocks more stuff. Rinse by restarting to get more powerful and repeat.Now, this isnt just an AdVenture cap where its just making money...this is where the Plus comes in. Raids, Knowledge books, Diamonds, Blue rocks, Red gems, Relics and Champions are all things you use this gold to upgrade and buy and unlock to further more earn gold and make you kingdom awesome. Whew, Thats alot of stuff huh? well yes, but it makes the game have more microorganizing and micromanageing ,thus more fun. Raids and Relics and Diamonds and ALL THOSE things basically without nit picking what each does and its rewards is just to buff or increase production to make you gold. In some way. Clicking still works on the rocks...lol. Names of champions and places to raid and such seem to all come from some form of mythology. Major, I havent seen anything form like celtic or Mayan, but yes Greek and Norse mythology names are thrown around alot here. It is King Midas... SO for the inner dragon/dwarf gambler that loves gold and loves using multiple managing ways to make more gold and gold , then yes , this is your idle/clicker game. GOLD! not pyrite."

76561197993517058,Not Recommended,557400,30208152,Posted: 26 February,all,{misanthrope} Muggs,The game is fun and has some interesting mechanics that set it apart from other idle games but there is a catch.  Unlike other idle games eventually you reach a point where you make zero gold offline compared to online.  Once you unlock the energy champ kenny you could be offline for a week and not even dent the amount of gold you need to reset.   This is a major issue with this game since I don't want to leave it running 24/7 just to play it which is pretty much required.   If they allowed offline to at least be somewhat equal to online the issue would be resolved but until then I can't in good faith reccomend this just yet.

Also, it is one of the only Clicker games where, with time, all of the different ""investment options"" have their use... its not like with so many other games, where 1 or 2 are always the best, and the others never keep up producing the most income... here, it has switched several times already!

I have 1500 mana and 2 auto skills and it waits until I have 1500 mana to use the skills. I generally use Lightning speed (800 mana) and Profit Monument (600) mana.

76561198137990909,Recommended,557400,30052425,Posted: 19 February,all,Painless,"A simple accumulations and scalings game. Find all of the little ways you can increase your income until you're rolling in the sheckles. Effectively free-to-play despite the in-game purchases, courtesy of daily bonus rewards.Favorite Pro: Diamonds, your main progress-tracking currency, can only be acquired by trading all of your current progress (except for important things like research and achievements).- The amount you ultimately hold after the trade (regardless of how many you had before) is based on how much progress you traded in.- The amount you hold amplifies your other incomes.- You can drop some of the ones you hold (which you essentially gain back next time you trade your progress) to get cool stuff.Pretty neat mechanic.Cons:- The art style is generic and fairly minimalist, and the game is certainly nice enough to suit a more stylish appearance.- A slightly-too-interesting usage of grammar and commas. I'm that kind of guy.Overall:Me likey. I want to see even more features to look forward to spending my Qas, Sps, and Sxds on."

Also, while there are microtransactions, everything you can get by paying you can also get via regular gameplay, so there is currently no content that is behind a paywall.

,Not Recommended,557400,29974903,Posted: 16 February,all,「§NG」| Crismo - [Nick],"I wouldn't recommend this game. They're pretty much going the same route as CS:GO, putting in tons of options for you to spend money, but nothing that improves free to play gameplay. At least in CS:GO you have skins that look pretty, in this game you have gems that go by quickly. I've played a bit since it released on STEAM, but it's only gone pay to win every update so far (pay to win? pay to go broke? not sure?).Now today with the addition of the special offers thing counting down on your main page, it's like trying to entice you to spend more money on special packs that are ""limited edition"" or something. The whole game is just a mad dash for developer money. It's fun to think of this game from a strategy perspective, but seriously there's nothing unique about this game at all, and there's no reason for you to waste money on it. Go waste your money on CS:GO buying sick skins or something cool.Bottom line: Grindy pay to win idle clicker?Not sure why anyone would spend more than $20 on a free to play idle clicker game in the first place.Just don't do it. Save your money. Save your time. Play something else."
