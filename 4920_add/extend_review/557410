,Recommended,557410,30725941,Posted: 25 March,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"DominionmeetsDesktop Dungeons.It can't be described in any simpler terms, as far as I can see. There are two components to this title, the world 'board', and the fighting card game. The card game is a deck builder nearly identical in both playstyle and strategy to the IRL card gameDominion. If you haven't played that card game, I guess in effort of keeping it simple, all I can say is that it is fantastic - and it works just as well here. The world map allows you to choose how you go about fighting enemies (mainly based on their level). The 'popcorn' strategy fromDesktop Dungeonstranslates quite well. There are shops and various places to visit that add to the strategy. There are meta-game upgrades, and that is cool. You can have multiple accounts, so no need for your significant other to buy it too. Nice addition.It isdefinitelyaddicting in the sense that you want to constantly do another run because 1) you learned how to build a better deck, and 2) you now have earned more starting power via meta-game upgrades.Sounds great? Yeah, it does and it is.There is a major 'con', though - the overall polish and artwork.And don't get it twisted - I don't care two-cents about graphics (I just came from playingNetHack 3.6.0an hour ago). This is about thequalityand care that was put into the artwork. Even if you are not a career artist, you can make things nice. This game does not do that. There is no style, and it shows in spades. The music is utterly forgettable. The controls are 'meh'. You can't use the keypad or keyboard to move as far as I have tried. The mouse is what you are stuck with (but you need the keyboard to enter an account name).To add insult to injury, this was ported from mobile and it was done poorly. There are black bars on my screen. C'mon.But at the end of the day, I think the mechanic works really well andjust barelyjustifies a positive review.Pros:+The mix of the two mechanics works really well (although neither is unique, and both have been done exactly the same before in other games)+Definitely has that 'one-more-run' appeal, specifically driven by meta-game upgradesCons:-The artwork investment standard couldn't be lower; this is the lowest point and actually puts me on the fence for a negative review-Generic music-Decidedly few options for controls, but what do you expect from a mobile port-Black bars on my screen-Apparently the mobile version is like four bucks; once again the PC market is taxedIt is fun, there is no denying that - and that's why it gets my vote BUT I do find it difficult to reward the lacklustre attempt at art and a poor mobile port."
76561198045650841,Recommended,557410,28274217,"Posted: 9 December, 2016",all,awheywood,"DISCLAIMER: I haven't played this game on Steam, but as of this writing I have apparently played it more than 1200 times on iOS.  I can't speak to the technical quality of this release, but I am very familiar with the gameplay.  I bought this game here to support the developer and to preach the virtues of Dream Quest to the benighted Steam masses.Dream Quest is the best rogue-like* I've ever played, and my favorite single-player game of all time.  I know this might be hard to believe, given the screenshots, but lurking behind those stilted stick figures is a game of exceptional ingenuity.To boil Dream Quest down to its most basic, you select a character class and start with a deck of ~10 cards, most of which are attack cards that simply deal damage, like Attack 1.  You wander around a level fighting monsters in a series of card battles, gaining experience and gold with which you improve your deck.  At the end of each level, there's a boss, and if you manage to defeat the third-floor boss, you face a final boss that's much, much harder than anything that came before.  Individual runs take perhaps 45 minutes at the very most, though most will end much sooner than that.The cards fall into a few basic categories.  Attack cards mostly just deal damage (sometimes of different kinds), but occasionally have other effects, like increasing the damage of future attacks or giving you a defensive buff for a turn.  Action cards do various things, and at the start of the game you're restricted to playing one per turn (this feels like it was pulled straight out of Dominion--Swiftness, for instance, is a straight-up Village clone).  Spells are like actions, broadly speaking, but they require MP to use instead of actions.  Mana cards provide the mana to cast your spells(sometimes with other neat effects).  Equipment cards stay out and have passive effects once played, and later in the game you can get equipment slots so that you start with them in play.  Reaction cards trigger from your hand and have some effect--for instance, if the enemy plays an attack card and you have Riposte in your hand, it cancels the attack, deals 2 damage to the attacker, and replaces itself.  It's also possible to get curses (usually just temporarily), which, in another apparent Dominion nod, are just blank cards.Each turn, you play/discard as many cards as you can/wish to, then draw up to your max hand size.  In the early game, you will almost always just play all your cards, but later in the game there are more in-combat choices.What's amazing about Dream Quest is the way seemingly simple mechanics unspool into one of the most varied games I've ever played.  Enemies, which are just piles of cards and HP with perhaps a passive ability, all present different and interesting obstacles.  Zombies bite you and doom you to die five turns later--better be able to kill them fast enough.  Water elementals slowly reduce your hand size.  Sphinxes forbid you from playing the most common card type in your hand, forcing you to build awkward hands in order to do anything.  This enemy variety is even more pronounced among the bosses, who all have interesting gimmicks and require different deck-building and play priorities.  The Phoenix, for example, turns into an egg for a turn when it dies, and is only truly defeated when you smash the egg; you therefore want to set up the turn where you kill the Phoenix to deal as much damage to the egg as possible.  The Gelatinous Cube slowly eats the cards of your deck, so reliance on just one card to deal damage could doom you.  Different fights feel remarkably different, especially once you get to know the contents of enemy decks and can play around them a bit.Player characters are even more varied.  Character classes have different starting decks, cards presented for purchase/level up, and activated abilities, so it's no surprise that they play very differently from one another.  What's almost shocking is how much variety exists within each class, and how seemingly weak cards can become essential to decks.  There are numerous cards I've written off as unplayable that have turned into deck MVPs, and even after a year and a half of play I'm finding new clever interactions.  To me, this is the chief draw of Dream Quest: decks end up playing wildly differently, and can all still succeed.Dream Quest is a hard game, but the limited length of the runs means that death is no great loss, and the difficulty makes victory satisfying.  But Dream Quest also has a very clever system for cheating death: each run earns you points (with the effective maximum being a very rare ~2k), and when you die you can spend 500 points to restart from your last level-up.  This price doubles each time you resurrect a character, so you can mitigate BS bad luck or undo a mistake a couple times, but it rapidly becomes too expensive to respawn.These points can also be spent to unlock things you otherwise gain via in-game achievements, which is another quietly ingenious system.  There's a lot to unlock, including 10 classes and 50 cards.  I generally have mixed feelings about unlocks--they often feel like pointless content gating--but in this case, the game is satisfying without unlocks, and it offers you a means to bypass them through general play.I have literally never played this game with sound.  The graphics are obviously poor.  The writing in the game is without exception powerfully goofy.  If these things are important, Dream Quest is probably not for you.So who is Dream Quest for?  I would unreservedly recommend Dream Quest to anyone who's interested in rogue-likes and/or deckbuilders and can get past the graphics; if you like Dominion or Magic drafts, there's a good chance you'll love Dream Quest.*less rogue-like than Rogue, more rogue-like than Rogue Legacy."

There is so much depth and discovery that it's kept me coming back for thousands of runs across multiple platforms. I own this game on my PC at home, on my Ipad, and on my phone. Was worth it every time! There are so many games these days that I usually end up spending the majority of time on Triple A's, but this is one of the few indie games I've run into that have soaked up hundreds of hours of my time. Introduced it to my friends and they loved it, then I introduced it to my girlfriend and we routinely do a run together before bed.

Basically a mix of Desktop Dungeons (2013) and the board game Dominion (2008). Though you can't get murdered by a level 10 goat here.You fight your way through three floors. On each, you encouter monsters (exp/gold) and shops and try to optimize the punching power of your deck. Each class has prefered card types, which causes them to encounter them more often: A priest or monk will find 'prayers', a mage 'spells' and a thief 'actions'.There is 5 card types:-the bread and butter 'attack' and deal x damage-the actions (that require action points) that often are something like 'do something, then draw a card""-prayers that you play and that get triggered after 1-5 turns-equipment that give you a permanent ability for the fight (e.g. deal 1 damage for every two attack cards you play; ignore the first 3 damage every turn; ..)-spells.. from fireball to hasteAnd thats the elements this surprisingly deep deck builder gets build from."

Do I fight that monster for exp, save it for a cooldown reset or ignore it? Which card should I buy? What kind of deck am I building and what is my win condition? If you look past the developer art on the cards (which does its job, cards are easy to recognize and distinguish), you have a true gem on your hands, that will keep you coming back and back to try and make a deck better than ever before. Plus, you can play the way you like. Want to replay a seed over and over to optimize it? You can. Want what an achievement unlocks, but don't feel like doing it?

This results in a somewhat original card game- one varied enough to stand out in my bloated collection, although the fantasy theme is basic.It goes without saying that the graphics are indeed horrible and the GUI feels like 1987- especially not having auto-turn end and clicking on the treasture box to end the match. I mean, we are talking about some very bad artwork here, my friends, and very rudimentary backgrounds, text windows, and sprites. Why not use royalty free graphics or invest in some passable images? Why release a game that doesn't even have cute pixels to fool everyone into thinking it is retro? Such a target for critics. That said, I read a comment that the developer now a job with Blizzard, so they must have been impressed with his gameplay, mechanics, and programming, so in many ways the bad graphics got their attention. Kinda like how Stevie Wonder stood out as a singer because he was blind.Most people will pass because of the lack of graphics, and that is a shame.

Deciding whether to spend your limited gold on good new cards, removing cruddy cards from your deck, or to upgrade various stats is tough, and a lot more interesting than most of the decisions you have to make in such games. Then, seeing how the deck you've built up functions against enemies (many of which have gimmicks that can utterly cripple an unprepared deck) is as satisfying as can be. Different pools of cards being available in addition to the passive and active abilities makes each class vastly different, and gives a suprising amount of variety to the experience.My only complaint is that I'd rather be playing this on my Android tablet (there's an iOS version), but this is more than good enough to warrant playing on PC."

Also, death feels like a slap in the face sometimes. Roguelikes are supposed to be notorious for being unfair, but there are some runs where it felt there was literally nothing I could do to stop from being killed.
