,Recommended,557630,30800275,Posted: 28 March,all,Subliminal Smile,"I just love it when I am able to stumble on a game like this by accident. I decided to try the demo initially, and was pleasantly surprised to find an entire first episode (I would definitely recommend you play this first before purchasing the game, which is the second episode in the series.) After finishing the first episode, I  was deeply hooked and immediately had to play more. This is sort of series that showcases what sort of twisted, amazing things can be created from RPGMaker. Hello Charlotte would be considered a horror game if forced into catergorization, just not ""scary"" in the way you might expect. The game frequently toys with the notion of horror being expressed in the most unexpected of ways; twisting the seemingly familiar, innocuous or mundane into something uncanny.It features beautiful art, unique design, interesting characters and refreshing dialogue, enjoyable puzzle elements with just the right amount of difficulty (get that pen and paper ready, you will want to take notes!) and a story that is impossible to describe in simple terms or a short synopsis: it's the sort of thing you have to experience for yourself. And you just don't want it to end.It's a surreal and dreamlike journey for sure, but not enough that you won't find yourself relating to it in some way. It becomes a surprisingly personal gaming experience. I felt myself genuinely caring about what was happening and those involved, and how my decisions have an effect. It explores themes of individuality, society, religion, adolescence, death, reality and more without becoming preachy or heavy-handed.  I am eagerly awaiting the third episode to see what comes next!"

The world, the characters, the story, the art, everything is of an amazing qualityOne thing I would recommend is to make it simpler to get to load files in game, I always like to have easy access to my save and load files so it is just a personal preference (ALSO BUNDLE THE FIRST GAME WITH THIS ONE SO PEOPLE WILL BE LESS CONFUSED)(I wanted to playthrough again so I had it clearer when I wrote this part so without further ado)Hello Charlotte is a game in which you play as Seth, you controls Charlotte. A puppeteer puppeting a puppeteer puppeting a puppet kind of situation is what you're introduced to from the very beginning of the story. It flows quickly from where it the first ended, but with a far deeper depth and darkness to itNo matter what you anticipate from this game, it will somehow do something you couldn't expect"

If you liked the universe, you need the second episode ; wich is even better but a little bit confusing because of the multiples yet contradictory endings--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Oh dear...Of course I liked it.At the beginning of episode 1, Hello Charlotte sounded like a bad joke. Instant deaths for touching a cube, silly monsters, riddles that only rely on luck...Hello Charlotte did look like one of the numerous surrealistic RPGM horror games. By exagerating all of their defaults, it became clear that it was actually more of a parody of these.But there was something more. The 4th wall breaking was somehow well done (can't we ignore Undertale was out at the same time?) and created consistency behind the parody. The characters, the universe were solid and very charming, not only built for parody.So what would the creator of such a game do in a second episode?Developp this universe of course! And I'd say that was what I liked the most in this episode 2. The secondary characters got a past, the world looked well constructed.Episode 2 is more like a Visual Novel parody, and, well, this was even more enjoyable than the first episode.The art is impressive, the music is awesome, the ambience is perfect.The world of Hello Charlotte is hopeless and scary.  There is an order, a routine, but it will break apart as soon as you approach the end.That's maybe why this game is not a 10/10 to me : the endings are satisfying when taken on their own, but in the end a little bit confusing, as they contredict each others in terms of universe's consistency. That wouldn't be a problem if the game was really belonging to the surrealistic RPGM gendra, but the end of ep 1 and most of ep 2 progressivly gave more and more consistency to this awfull yet fascinating universe of eyeballs and false gods.Or are they true? Eh, I don't even know now... This has been a long emotional journey (yet 10 hours for the 2 episodes), I need some rest......but pls episode 3 !"

,Recommended,557630,28268751,"Posted: 9 December, 2016",all,DeaD MaN,"A solid game, every RPG and VN fan should experienceReview is based on the English version.tl;dr spectacular game! Go buy it now.ProsMagcats.Consistent and good art. All of the characters are drawn in the same style with the same care, love and level of detail. Same for the backgrounds, yes, they are in different aesthetic, but that makes them even better. Don't get me started on how in many VNs the style and quality of assets are all over the place (same for RPGs like Undertale - sh*t's not even funny.)Fitting soundtrack.Not over the top forth wall breaking. This is not mr. Kojima's style, it's on the other side of the spectrum. Those times when it does happens - it fits perfectly into dialogue or the story progression.Ton of references. Some of them are little nods to other works and works in progress by the developer.Interesting plot and setting. It is somewhat complicated and convoluted on the outside, but the main themes are very grounded and relatable.Characters. In this episode they had more or less equal screen time.Magcats. <3ConsNot much a con, just an observation. This version does not contain art and music as a separate pack. The original release on itch.io does. Iassumethat the art there should be in its original quality, same as the music.Minor bugs. Most are harmless and maybe like 2 or 3 are game braking, requiring you to quit to title screen and retry.More of inconvenience. As with the fist episode - you can save almost anytime, but to load you need to quit to the title screen. A load menu button right under the save one would have been great.Main endings feel a bit rushed. The buildup needs to be more paced, and some the reasonings are creating more questions than they should**.NotesAlthough I expect that the Russian translation is superb and doesn't lose most the original quirks, I advise to play the game in English as Etherane originally intended.I strongly suggest to play episode 1 prior to this since it will answer some of the questions and will give a foundation for the game setting and themes (and hey, it's free!)Game is a parody and it knows it. But the second episode is far more serious than the first one and that's why it's more cautious of being self-aware. This is a pro and a con at the same time. So be warned.**I'm planing to replay the game in one go and this will maybe clear up some of the misunderstandings and conflicted feeling."

I did not know this when I purchased this copy. I'm not upset, but I'd prefer if they bundled this game with the first half, since I was very lost when I frist started the game."
76561198166047022,Recommended,557630,33477748,Posted: 12 July,all,noelcia.m,"An amazing surreal experience! There are some really clever (or trolling) puzzles and so much of this game operates on a ""dream-like"" logic. The characters are well fleshed out and lovable so you'll surely find yourself rooting for them a lot, and getting upset when bad things happen. It's dark but also very funny at times. Plus the unique mystical yet minimalistic aesthetic is worth playing it by itself! Definitely a game I will remember fondly forever. And it's real cheap so what are you even doing reading this chaotic ""review"", just go play it and see for yourself!!"

It's exactly what you expect out of a cutesy-creepy RPG Maker game of this type. Well executed as far as style & writing goes but not much ""gameplay"" to speak of.I guess my main complaint is that i wish it had been a full blown VN or point&click game as i tire of these pseudo-RPGs...otherwise, yeah it's worth your time. And the first chapter is freely available over at itch.io. Go play that one first or you will be very confused."

It was a beautiful work of art and it goes great with the first chapters. If there would ever be anymore games I would be sure to play them. The storyline was cute but also sad and I wish to see more from the creator. If I had to rate it I would give it a 9 out of 10 because no game is perfect and there are flaws but it if worth the money."

76561198055310996,Recommended,557630,29454382,Posted: 23 January,all,Dreadeox,"Hello Charlotte 2 tells a weird story, a good one though. About three hours of content. The first hour is confusing as it threw a bunch of odd characters and a weird story at you. It seemed to lack direction (perhaps b/c I didn't play the first ep). The second hour introduced some puzzles. There aren't many, maybe about three in all. The story began to gain some direction at this time; who Charlotte is, what her struggles were, and how she viewed the wrapped world she lived in... But it was this 2nd hour that I began to really enjoy the saddening story. And, as for the third hour, well, lets just say our characters hit their limit. There is no happy ending for Charlotte, but maybe you can find one for her... in this wrapped world, we call our minds."

Tbh i can't decide which episode was better, but all of them made me so amazed by it. It has amazing art and story, i also leve characters and the weird, a little confusing atmosphere and world that was created by the author. I would definitely check out more games like this!
