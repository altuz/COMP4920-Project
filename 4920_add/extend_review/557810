,Not Recommended,557810,29479620,Posted: 25 January,all,Kissker,"Too many problems to enjoy.Balance issue is terrible.Away bug not giving/displaying proper gold (forcing to keep playing if you want to advance at all)Giant Brick wall that can only be avoided if you go to zone 3, ascend, repeatedly and use the ""free stars"" to boost your world STR/Crit so you can do more DPS. (very boring process too)  By repeatedly I mean over 100x as each time only seems to give 5 stars.DPS doesn't increase past level 150.  Known bug- no fix.Skills not working at all - or shutting off early - or not working properly in general.  Skill use is also extremely clunky - as you go to another tab/menu, scroll down to use it, and if you return to the buy heroes it's at the top again too - very cumbersome to always start at top of scroll lists instead of ""where you left off""This game should NOT have been released as/is - it is a ALPHA game as it is, and should be addressed properly. (Alpha means there are core problems being worked out or added to it that will shape the entire game, like adding Jumping to a platform game)Fox Dawn needs to re-think how to balance things for the Gold required to level up the heroes VS the damage they dish out - relying too heavily on RNG Equipment drops is poor game mechanics."

P2W for 2x perma dps.Made it to lvl 7.x, where I would pray for crits mostly, and only from one hero, wtf?"

,Not Recommended,557810,29910951,Posted: 13 February,all,Black Viper,"Check the Steam forums first.Game breaking bugs and ignoring the community for, as of this review, two months after release.Absolutely awesome game with great features (loot drop) that I really like for a clicker/idle, but due to the nasty issues with gold, skill calculation and useless leveling up heroes past level 150, please just pass.Feel free to fire it up due to it being ""free"" and check out how much this game CAN be great, but do as I did and spend zero real money as you will rapidly realize your cash was wasted by sending to a development team that vanished after Steam release.Edit: March 28, 20171.5 months AFTER posting the above review, the top unpinned discussion is still asking if the devs are ignoring the game..."

There are quite a bit of bugs. The game is horribly unbalanced. Ascending gives you almost no perks. The gameplay is slow and frustrating.  I only made it to zone 7 after three weeks of playing, and there's an achievement for zone 3200?? Please. If I kept going at that rate, I'd reach zone 3200 in 1,371 weeks... or 26 years. Which is the reason I finally decided to uninstall and write a review.The devs only needed to change a few things to fix the frustrating parts of the game, but the last time we heard from them was the day after the game was released. They asked for suggestions and then disappeared.Do not download this game. Please. It isn't worth it."

I hopefully WONT become one of those people so im just basically reviewing what i played. And that is that the game works, it has a great soundtrack so far and i like the animations in it.I dont understand all these people leaving bad reviews on a clicker game i mean if the thing installs and works what could be bad about it? Its a freaking CLICKER game not the mona lisa of video games geeze lol."

,Not Recommended,557810,29731154,Posted: 5 February,all,Illisia,"Hm... I love this game... BUT it is quite ""buggy"" (lots of faults in the way the game works, or rather does not work)... For instance, the more heroes you have or the bigger the boss you are fighting, the slower the game will be and the less responsive your clicks are, but the worst bug is the one where the user interface is completely lost and your clicks are not registered and the game does not progress at all etc and you have to close and re-open the game. I would recommend this, were it not for the bugs, but sadly, as-is, I cannot recommend it."

Would come back to this game to check if anything improved in the future :o"
,Not Recommended,557810,29505121,Posted: 26 January,all,MrsLilyPoo,"I'm kind of an idle/clicker game addict, so when I saw this I was so excited! However, the game starts out EXTREMELY LOUD and there's no way to turn the sounds down, only off. So that was kind of a turn off to start out with.Then, there's no tutorial or explanation to the game. I didn't need one, but still it's helpful for those who haven't played many idle games. The item system is cool, but could be better. Instead of automatically replacing the items (with no notification except for epic/legendary items) it would be nice to collect them in a chest to sell or replace other items later.All in all, not a bad game but I only played it for like 10 minutes max. and I just didn't like it."
