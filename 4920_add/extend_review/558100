,Recommended,558100,29750309,Posted: 6 February,all,Théopold Dugré,"Excellent game taking a concept that was not seen before except in flash based browser games like Age of War, but taking to a whole other level!Some players might argue that since you only control what amount of what type of creatures you summon, makes the game too simple, and does not give the player enough strategizing options, but i have to disagree, the fact that your options are limited makes strategy even more important in my opinion.Hear me out on that one, if played in ranked, one player of each team bans a commander skill, and another bans a troop. What you think your ennemy might play factors a lot into that choice, let's say you faced an oponent before, and you know he prefers terrans, banning terran skills and troops might force him out of his comfort zone.then once in-game, MANY choices are in front of you, do you produce mass low tier troops? do you produce minimal amount needed to hold back the ennemies to save for early tier 2 or 3?? then you need to make decisions to counter the ennemy tactics, for example, they have no anti-air early on, instead of your usual tactics you then produce flying troops to force them to adapt, etc.Also after playing a while and gathering a lot of currencies you start unlocking advanced troops, then again adding another level of strategy to the game, as some troops are ""weaker"" but have amazing active abilites you then must decide when to use.All in all, GREAT game!! can't wait for the actual release!"

,Not Recommended,558100,29407126,Posted: 21 January,all,FTW^Vanilla Mack,"So this game has its moments.  Relatively fun Beta.  It is based on SC2 Arcade Desert Strike.  I <3 Des   Here is my list of things that unfortunately make in inferior during the Beta.-It doesn't allow you to move the screen when you are selecting a card.  It isn't a very big map.-When you first start off people have an advantage because of cards, upgrades or specials.  I think this really bothers me because Des is about countering units.  It is much harder to counter when you simply cannot have that upgrade.-You cannot just click a unit and see what it is.  You have to hold tab to see their layout.-At the starting when you can earn extra $$$ the units have terrible AI"

It gets a negative review.  Plus the game is shutting down in 2 days for a few months...OK easiest way to explain is by example.Just played a match where we dominated them.  Their base was almost dead but then final battle came.  They actually WON! because of the map having a bottle neck (entrance going smaller into base).  Their bad units beat us.  we had 174+ units vs their 50.  They won because our units got stuck behind the bottleneck.Just like the movie 300....  except their units were trash.   Entire map needs to be same size/width, or people will become very angry about this."

76561198004995062,Recommended,558100,29496823,Posted: 25 January,all,Michael,"I think the word ""relaxing"" best fits this game, ironic I know since it's about war.Coming from DesertStrike (Starcraft 2 arcade map), its game mechanics in the BETA came pretty intuitively. Have a bunch of dps and put tanks in front to soak damage, stick in some stealth units to fk with your opponents, and most importantly counter your opponents' army composition with your own. Simple enough.NO LAG, and best part is I can play this game in bed on my laptop mostly with just the keyboard, with the rare one or two clicks from the trackpad for upgrading units and using commander powers. Like, imagine coming home after gym at night and you just want to play something with low-as-fk APM and fun. This is your game.For the RUNES, I personally didn't care too much about them. It's pretty much League-of-Legend-like and too much hassle for such little difference (like.. you need to level them to pretty high levels to actually feel any impact in matches, which needs many many hours invested into grinding, ain't nobody got time for that, well... maybe kids. iuno.) I can sort of see this mechanic as a potential pay-to-win source. uhoh.The UNITS though, very cool designs mostly, especially the variations of the standard units. Actually, the standards all seem to look worse than the variations, probably because they want you to invest to unlock them. ATLAC race looks really cool. YAOGUAI is kinda weird, since they're pretty much just furries, trying to fight against the other races which got rockets and plasma weapons or wteva lol like srs? There's some little things, like TERRAN race using arrows, spears, and horses, but also guns, motorcycles, and mechs?! Some weird age-difference in terms of technology right there. Doesn't look quite right when you see them together.COMMANDER POWERS - Could really use some detailed descriptions of these things when you hover your mouse over. Like, if it's summon a unit or something, have it show the HP/DEF/DMG/RANGE/DURATION/etc. If it's an AoE thing, show the maximum number of units it can affect, just GIVE US MORE INFORMATION cause right now it's just going on feel for me at least.CANNOT play against FRIENDS - I really wish I could invite my friends to a custom game and square off against them, but that didn't exist in the BETA. Hopefully it'll be in the full game release.NO TEAMCHAT - Everything you type is talk-to-all. So how da heck do you plan strategies without letting the enemy team know?! There's only so much the emote lines can say. Most the time people just don't talk period. I've had to spam chat to get any response.SOUL ESSENCE MINE UPGRADE - For new players, I think just having the cost and down-time-duration as a hover-text over the icon is good enough, cause right now, if you don't already know how much it costs to upgrade at the 2 periods, you won't know until you click it and get denied.UNIT PATHING - For the majority of the time, it's pretty alright, but occasionally, especially early game around the lootboxes at the middle, they do some weird merry-go-round stuff, which mostly gets the melee units killed since they're just kinda spazzing out and not hitting anything. Also, units will just chase surviving enemy observers into the cannons and get melted instead of shooting at the crates, kinda weird.Overall IMO, a very fun game requiring little effort to play. Runs super smooth for the amount of units it's showing even at high graphics. Designs are cool, matches are quick to queue for AND play, GOOD STUFF YE. Get it."

,Recommended,558100,29584575,Posted: 30 January,all,Pootischu,"Seeing some of the positive review and have some hours into the game, I managed to get to level 30 and decided to write a review.Art of War: Red Tides is a Massieve Multiplayer Online game where players (or commanders) were faced with an opponent in a simple map consist of 2 base facing each other. Commander would ""create"" troops with soul essence, and each wave the ""created"" troops produced the same amount of ""created"" troops without cost (For example, you created 5 snipers for 1000 soul essence, and then you got 5 snipers each wave without cost). This ""created"" troops is independent and you cannot control their movements. This may seems too easy, but with 3 different armies each with over 15 units to choose, you can custumize your playstyle ranging from stealth to full-blown air attack facing great numbers of anti-air unit. Commanders could also use commander's skill like missile, airborne, siege engine, etc..Personally, this is a great game if you like to experiment on doing various things to achieve victory.  It may be frustating and unbalanced sometimes, but if you got the hang of it, it'll be load of fun. 9/10"

What i love about this game is the way it is. You dont have to be really good, you will always win at some point. It also takes srategy, you have to think of how many units and what units to use at the right time in order to defaet your enemy. So if I were you i would get this game and wait for the new beta to come out."

This is still much better than games such as star wars force arena.PS. anyone who plays StarCraft 2 desert strike in the arcade will be very familiar with this game and most likely hooked instantly :P

Gameplay was solid graphics were nice concept was on point. However their were alot of units that were basically pointless some did way to much damage others barely did any. Lots of typographical errors. However playing globally across the servers worked extremely well. Keep up the good work guys. Try to improve the AI a tad if possible
,Recommended,558100,29504601,Posted: 26 January,all,Sweetcorn,"This game is very good, It had lots of different units in the beta and lots of different things that were cool (little features)And that was a beta if they add like 8 or 9 more species more into the main game and some new abilitys and units with unique abilities i think this game could become really good.However The games engine that it runs on isnt the greatest, If there are say 200 units fighting each side at the same time it can cause FPS drops/lag and id like to see that fixed as well as some abilities that shouldnt be in the game or should be nerfed.Overall I think if the devs play there cards right with this game id totally buy it for £49.99+."
76561198138553268,Recommended,558100,29504926,Posted: 26 January,all,Zombie,"Not sure about PvP since I could never find enough people, but I played several games against AI, and thoroughly enjoyed it.None of the troops felt overpowering, high tier troops were expensive and powerful, low tier troops were weaker and cheaper to build.  The games progressed at a good rate and weren't to long, but long enough for the tables to turn if you didn't keep up the pressure. The upgrade system was extremely easy to follow, since there wasn't really much there at the moment. Each match completed would award xp which was used to level up, and leveling would unlock new troops and abilities to use. Leveling up seemed to move fairly quickly, though im not sure if it slows down later on since I only got to 5 or 6.Overall,  would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes stratagy games or anyone looking for a relaxing fun gamee to play."

I highly reccomend you check this game out. The main aim of the game is to deploy your units (Anti-Air, Anti-Ground, Detector Units, Cloaked etc.) and with those units you need to fight against the odds of the enemy team to destroy their turrets and finally, their... let's just call it a Mothership. You can also get these power ups, cards... or whatever you may call them which are special attacks, e.g: Nuke, Siege Cannon and Mind Control (some of my favorites) These can gain you the upper hand in the game allowing you to absolutely Annhialate your enemies. (The only downfall of this game is that you can spam ANY unit of your choice... I personally think they should add a Unit cap to each unit.) Anyway, long story short, This is a great game, anyone would be stupid NOT to check it out!"

I would very much like it if the rank match alowed the players to truely stratigies, because from my experience i cant chat to my team during the banning mode, and i would like that all the players had something to ban. The next problem is that the battle field is to short and the support skills are somehow useless, also I would like it if you added turrent upgrades and maybe make them more durable and have unique skills.

No bugs or any problems of the sort.The sound quality is good as are the graphicsOverall the game is worth trying.

It's a great game to play casually and an even better game to dive into.  I really enjoyed trying to make my strategy for the day as efficient as possible while reacting to what the enemy was presenting on the battlefield.  The timing between troop deployments really sets up the foundation for the entire game and i think you guys nailed it!

Easy to pick up almost impossible to master :D  Lots of variety in the way you can play from the 3 factions.  Can't wait to see all that's changed since the beta!"
