I am a 9th grade conceptual physics teacher in the Bay Area and am already thinking of ways to share this game with my students in class. I learned so much from playing this and loved seeing how it helps players to develop scientific knowledge through modeling and argumentation. I feel like I finally understand the evidence that supports our modern understanding of astronomy in a way that could help me explain and teach it to others. This game even gave me ideas for demos I could use in class to teach pendulum motion next year. I loved reading Bryan Brown's and Jonathan Osborne's testimonials as both of them taught me at STEP. I am so excited to tell everyone about Odyssey. Great job, and I can't wait for the sequel!"

There have been slim pickings on Steam recently for this type of game, or so it seemed. I was once again browsing, trying to find something when I fell across Odyssey. I hadn't seen it before,knew nothing about it,  but in desperation I bought it. One the best purchases I have made on Steam. It is set on several small Islands full of mechanical type puzzles which seem to all be cosmology based. It is an educational game that comes with a journal which fills as you progress. The journal is quite a bit of reading, full of information that educates and points the direction.  I realised quite quickly that you don't need to read it all, the relevant 'clues' are highlighted. When I play it with my Grandson though, and I will, we shall read it all and I'm sure he will learn plenty. Lovely graphics, great puzzles, loads of interesting facts, absolutely nothing to improve on (well maybe the footsteps on the ladder sounds). Honestly, if you enjoyed Quern this is a must have game, hope there's hours and hours left."
,Recommended,558110,31268119,Posted: 20 April,all,Andi,"Odyssey is a first person exploration game with numerous, scientific puzzles to solve.  However, If your looking for a challenging puzzle game that will bake your brain, you may want to pass this one by.  Odyssey seems to be more geared for kids and adults who are looking for a relaxing time playing a science based game with straight forward puzzles.Solving puzzles is in my nature, and so is science.  So when I heard about this game I kept an eye on it and waited for a sale.  “Why not buy now, it's only $14.99?”  Simple, I never buy games at full price, I'm frugal that way.  Nonetheless, the main reason is that after reading some of the comments I learned that this game is somewhat short.  It took me about 6 hours to finish and that's me checking every nook and cranny that I could find.Pros:- The graphics are decent- The voice acting (what little there is) is good- Various parts of the island to explore- All of the puzzles are based on real life facts and science- Like Quern, you must have certain items to progress- The items in your inventory can be used again... and againCons:- No character development- You can't save progress until pick up pages from the journal- Way too much reading- Fairly LinearI did state that this game seems to be geared towards kids because some of the puzzles are very simple, however, there are a few puzzles that did make me scratch my head for a few minutes before I saw the solution pop into my pea sized head.  I also liked the fact that there are items in your inventory that you could use multiple times and not simply disappear after you used it.As of now, there is no one on the island except yourself, so there is no character development yet.  Unless, there's a surprise in future updates, I don't think there will be any but I've been wrong before.  I only mentioned this because for some players, getting to know the characters and what drives them, is important.  For me, it's not that big of a deal.  One thing I didn't care for is the save system.  The game will save when you pickup pages to the journal for solve a puzzle, not when you last quit the game.This biggest problem I had with this game is the enormous amount of reading.  The saving grace is that the important information is highlighted but there is a little problem with this.  The highlighted information almost gives you the answer.  I would have preferred that the developers cut the useless information and stick to the story and the puzzles at hand.  That would made it a little more challenging and enjoyable... at least for me it would have.At the time of this review, Odyssey was selling for $14.99.  I did enjoy this game and I'm looking forward to the next installment but If you want to try this game, I would wait for a sale, because as I said before, this game is short."

However, I'm amazed at any serious attempts of people creating educational games. I wish I had access to more games that looked as promising as Odyssey when I was a kid.Then I read the negative reviews and decided to buy the game anyways - to see for myself and report on it.I am not at all sorry I did. In fact, now that I played the game, I'm even more enthusiastic about it! The game manages to convey the scientific process in a compelling, easy to digest and mostly non-condescending way. The solutions to the various puzzles are highlighted in the journal entries you get to read throughout the game. I wonder if it could have done without them (except for a few puzzles).The world is beautiful and lends itself to exploration. The graphics certainly aren't as polished as in a tripple-A game, but that would be weird to expect. I actually got a Myst vibe from them. Which is not to say that Odyssey is like Myst. Don't buy the game if all you want is a new Myst successor.The controlls are a bit clunky - putting the inventory on the space-button is treacherous in a time when the space bar is more often connected to jumping. I'm amazed at the maximum walking speed (which you can set in the options menu to your prefered speed). I relished how the game let me breeze through the world at ease without bothering to limit me to a more reasonable speed. Going up ladders felt even more awesome! Yet, I certainly took my time looking at the world around me. (The time I played is a bit skewed, since I was afk a few times as well.)All in all, I'm glad I paid for this game, and I'm hopeful the devs will continue making interesting educational games (which includes a second part to Odyssey). Simply because I want to see more children fascinated by the world around them and fascinated by science.Edit: What I would like to add, but didn't think of before, since I'm not a parent: Don't discard this game because it doesn't appeal to your seasoned gamer standards. One day this game might be just what your kid needs to grasp astrology and gravity better."

However, about 40% to 50% of the time playing Odyssey the player spends reading the journal, so you have to have somewhat of a different mindset than a normal puzzel game (some people may enjoy this, other may not).  The islands are beautiful, and the few time the game turned somewhat adventury it was really cool to explore the nature of the game. I do wish either it was a bit longer orthe story was complete at the end of the game. It took me about two days of casual playing to complete this game, so I felt justified only spending around 10 bucks to play (since the puzzels are also very good and the scenery is enjoyable).  The controls are a little bit wonky however, and at times the interface is not the best. Overall this game is well worth the money and is a really great experience to play."

I wanted to congratulate the creative team on the extraordinary achievement of making a fun as welll as great looking game that also imparts an enormous amount of information and tells a beautiful coherent history of the building of knowledge (of physics and astronomy). It retraces the thought processes of some of the greatest thinkers and philosophers in human history and lets the players walk in their footsteps to arrive at objective truths about the cosmos we are part of.We loved it so much that we are eager to know if there is any news (near of far) of a sequel to the game.It was an absolute pleasure to go through the logical steps to see how we, as human race, acquired some of the knowledge that we take for granted today and kids learn about in school. In a recent trip to the famous Griffiths Observatory in Los Angeles, we were watching a show in the planetatirum and the narrator essentially walked us throught the same steps of logic. My daughter kept poking me the whole time as she recognized the philosophers and their logical arguments and later we talked about how much fun it was to play the game.Would wait to get from from the creators of this game in future."

I saw a headline comparing it to Myst and immediately went and bought it without reading anything else about it.Amazing first impressions, the graphics ran a little slow on my higher end graphics card, but not slow enough to be annoying. The story is well laid out, and I like the way the puzzles connect to the story, it gives it a lot of the Myst feeling.Pros:Awesome story that integrates seamlessly with the puzzlesI liked the level of difficulty some of the puzzles involvedFelt a lot like Myst (in a good way), but it also has the feeling that it's something else, it's own gameGraphics are very well done considering it's made with Unity (I'm a gamedev who uses Unity a lot)Cons:Needs a help button, a few of the mathematical puzzles got me and I had to poke around on the steam discussions to find the answersGraphics where a bit slow on my GTX970M, so some things might be able to be improved thereThe mouse movement needs to be changed, it felt slow and sluggish, almost as if there was accelerationOverall I'd give it 5 stars!

Basically I had to read through 200+ pages of a troubled teen girl's diary to solve puzzles, and some puzzles weren't even necessary to go ahead. Just a find the box with the next hunch of pages to read and BAM follow the colored cable (feel sorry for colorblind players) to the next location. Where a 13 years old girl would have used time and resources to scheme math, physics and astronomy riddles (some easy, some unable to solve unless you studied the diary to get into the girl's mind) to halt your advancement, following a storytelling plot that could even be agreeable to live IF it wasn't cut abruptly by a nonsense ending. Meh.TL:DR - Easy to you-need-to-read-the-manual(walkthrough?) riddles. Story cut abruptly. Not worth full price."

As long as you go into the game knowing this and you have a basic interest in astronomy or physics you should enjoy it. The negative reviews seem to be present because this was not what they where expecting.If you dont read very often or find reading large amounts of text difficult then view this game as something to motivate you.I bought this game for a slightly reduced price, but i would happily pay the whole £10.99 for it. I will be buying the sequal when its out."

The gameplay is reminscent of Myst, though is aimed at conceptualising scientific ideas in an interactive way, rather than a being a series of puzzles to be solved in a fictitious world.It seems aimed towards early teenagers & would recommend for anyone interested in a gamified learning experience"
,Not Recommended,558110,31270079,Posted: 21 April,all,tsgray,"I was hopeful for this game when I saw reviews likening it to Quern and other puzzle games, but was sorely disappointed. Let me explain, This game is geared towards to maybe a 6 or 7th grade knowledge level. Most of the ""puzzles"" are things that most any adult will probably remember from grade/high school thus making the game rather mundane for an adult to play. The journal pretty much gives you the answers and as per a previous reviewer, the journal usually highlights the answers so you don't even really have to hunt for the few puzzles that need a code or what not. The inventory system is generally a waste of time, all of what is there could be done via a button on a console after a puzzle unlocks it. While the general gameplay and atmosphere is pretty nice, mostly on par with Quern and some of the Myst series, the lack of difficulty and content (took me less than 2 hours to finish) makes this game not worth the $10 I paid. If you want to use this as a tool for part of an elementary physics/astro class, then sure, it does an ok job of outlining how some basic classical mechanics works, other than that, don't bother.To sum up:Pros:good graphicsno annoying ""where the heck is the lever/button/whatever I have to use""movement is pretty much unhinderedcould be a teaching toolCons:length (finished in less than 2 hours)unfinished game (cliffhanger ending... lame)more or less trivial puzzlescompletely linear, each puzzle has to be finished in orderno suspense/mysteryInventory items generally a waste of timeachievements are silly, you have to get them to finish the gameIf you are looking for a game for a child, this may be something to help them learn some elementary physics and astro principles, but if you are looking for a good puzzle game, don't bother with this even at reduced price."

,Not Recommended,558110,34855397,Posted: 10 September,all,Insanitys Muse,"I feel like this game kind of misses the mark for what it was going for, or at least claiming to be. It is largely just reading, with a pretty limited interactive puzzle based on what you read. I think this is not really taking advantage of the medium at all, an education game should FOCUS on the interactive experience allowed by the fact of being a game. As it was presented here, it just felt like I was reading an ""Astronomy for Dummies"" book, like chapter 1 or 2, with some clicking periodically and extra story thrown in to give some kind of excuse.The puzzles themselves are pretty simple because they rely so heavily on one or two sentences of what you read, a couple basic principles each. While that's not particularly bad, the fact you have to read so much for such short simple puzzles which boil down to simple concepts is definitely off putting and never really gives a feeling of accomplishment, or learning, really.It really reminds me of being in the astronomy section of a science museum but with more reading and fewer interactive exhibits, actually. It might be worth picking up on sale for some specific purpose, but even then, I might wait until something better comes along."

The puzzles aren't too easy or too complicated and you never feel 'lost' as what to do next. An added benefit is that you are either taught or reminded of some interesting science.The only gripe, other than the price, is the ending. It was like the ending of 'The Guest'. You feel like you are involved in something and it just abruptly ends in the middle of it. And, like in any good ride, the end seems to come all too soon."

Concept of this game is nice, but poorly executed. Instead of putting all the answers in the journal, it would've been nice to be able to interpret standalone clues for ourselves. The answers are literally highlighted in the journal to make it even more obvious.Also the movement in this game is extremely jarring, and for whatever reason you can't look around with the inventory open. The game looks very pretty, but the first-person zoomed-in viewpoint gave me a headache. I tried smoothing out the ""look"" feature as much as possible in settings, but it didn't help enough. Point and click would probably have been better, although not as immersive.I played for a half hour and was so bored that I promptly asked for a refund. According to other reviews, it's an unfinished game anyway, so I probably won't be missing much.

After the zip line for example, i realize I have to get the sun low on the tropic of capricorn, but where does the sun have to point? There's no clue to that, you just spin the earth around until something clicks. And in the top of the tower before the zip line, the constellations are backwards from what they are in the room. The game is definitely educational but it misses the mark in the entertainment part. I'm an hour in and I'm over 100 pages of journal reading. I'm playing with my 8 year old and she punched out a long time ago. Maybe for a teen but not really any younger than that. I'll uninstall for a while and come back another year.That said, I have saying that I don't recommend this either! I need a ""Meh"" setting. Its not recommended for me in my current situation but as a myst type game its probably pretty good. No bugs for me by the way except in the constellation tower I wasnt able to sit in the chair after I turned the crank a few times."

I like the idea that you can walk away from this game having learned something or at least freshen things up a bit upstairs. The downside is that most of the puzzles are explained away in the journal, which leaves them as just a short illustration of what you just learned. What it tries to do teach you using the reward system of gaming. This results in  the story and gaming element suffering a bit because of it.I'm looking forward to a successor where I'm sure they will adress this, if not at least I'll have learned something again."

Don't get me wrong, I don't mind reading, but there are lots of people who do. And I felt like I spent more time reading than actually doing anything, which brings me to the next point-Puzzles: The puzzles are set up nicely, but when you actually do all the reading, you'll most of the time not have to think for yourself because the solutions are in the journal already.-Ending: There is none...the game stops rather than it ends ;DSo, to be a bit more precise:I loved playing the game with it's atmosphere and beautiful scenery. No bugs, no crashes, no glitches I observed, everything running smoothly. But as I already mentioned, it's a lot of reading. You find journal pages, you read them, you stumble into a puzzle relating to what you just read, but because you read them, it's not a puzzle any more, the solution was in them already. You solve the puzzle only to find the next journal pages and start reading again.It's not like other educational games I played (like ""Physikus"" for example which I really enjoyed), where you get to a puzzle you have an idea what it wants you to do but you need to know the physics to solve it, so you have a journal where you can read them up. In this game, at least that's the way I felt, you often run into puzzles you don't have the slightest idea what they are about (at least when you haven't read the journal) and reading the journal doesn't only tell you what they are but what the solution is. That, in my opinion, is a little too easy. I'd have loved doing some thinking myself, or some trying out stuff before (not after) I know the solution.Still, there's much to try out and play around with, which is really fascinating. So, if you want to know how mankind came from ""our flat earth is the centre of the universe"" to what we know now, buy this game."

Some cool puzzles, I'd love to see how someone who hasn't had a mechanics background would react to it.While I think (hope) a lot of Steam users are familiar with the basic story of Copernicus and later Galileo, I learned a lot about the reasons geocentrism persisted for so long. The practical illustration of celestial movements was also eye opening.This seems like a natural progression, so it's probably already planned, but I'd love to see what creative puzzles you can come up with to illustrate the history of our understanding of the tides!Loved the soundtrack too!"
