,Not Recommended,558870,29947184,Posted: 15 February,all,-V-,"I really wanted to like this game.  Long review ahead.Did I get my $10 worth?  Sure.My PC is right in between the minimum specs and recommended specs, and so while the game itself ran okay, the achievements lagged, all the cinematics failed, and any chance to freeze was a chance taken.  So I rented a high end rig to play instead.This is not a management game, and could hardly be called a game at all.  This is merely an idle game with a bit of interactivity requiring top of the line hardware to support useless, game interrupting, cheesy-as-hell cinematics.  The tutorial is 'hand-holdy' to the point of not showing the mechanics properly until full game, and even then the narrator comes off as condescending and infantalizing rather than seductive.You do 3 things in this game: You walk around ""fixing problems"" by selecting from 2 choices on a very finite number of scenarios, which are good for a laugh the first time, but quickly become dull since there are only about 5 for each category (supposedly you get more as you unlock more, but I got most of the way unlocked and didn't see anything new).  You also purchase club upgrades which have no gameplay differences, only an annoying cinematic with each and every upgrade.  Each and every, that's right.The last thing you do is complete ""Events"" which are tricky little mini-games where you click on the falling objects before they hit the bottom of the screen.  This is one of the redeeming factors in the game and the only bit of gameplay involved.  The mini-games are tough, but fair, and more than doable without cheating with a bit of practice and some top of the line hardware.I hate to find myself disappointed in this 'game', but one of the things 'good' about it are the annoying-as-crap achievements for each and every little thing you do (which also lag the game if you aren't top-spec).  Instead of 1 achievement for ""Hire 25 dancers"" there are 25 achievements:  'hire 1 dancer', 'hire 2 dancers', 'hire 3 dancers'... all the way up to 25.  You did this, community.  You asked for more achievements, and you got them. *tuts*Perhaps if this was an actual game with actual gameplay, instead of a shiny idler with boobs that's marketed as a game, it'd be really good.  I'd kill for a good strip club management/tycoon game.  Well, maybe not kill, but seriously maim."

76561198041571110,Recommended,558870,32420042,Posted: 14 June,all,Turjav,"I bought this game on sale for a dollar expecting it to be a buggy mess and found that what is there is fine... there just isn't hardly anything in it.1) There is absolutley no sex in this game (not even the kind of strongly hinted at offscreen sex you would expect to find in a bioware game.) On a related note, I think it's very bad that Steam is home to murder-simulators like Hatred and Postal but I can't name a game on Steam with any significant depiction of sex between consenting adults (mods don't count and the cheescake pics in heavily censored visual novels are hardly significant.)2) There is no real gameplay to this game. You just walk around the club and respond to people who have an unhappy face choosing from a very limited set of options which boost either your repuation or your cash... don't let that fact lead you to assume that there is any management gameplay btw becaus there isn't.Money flows in regularly and you spend it on upgrades. That's it. No regular expenses to manage. No ability to feel like you are actually running a club. This game should be called ""customer service rep"" because that is all that you do.3) There is a mini game whch is basically a very poorly implemented version of Fast Food for Atari 2600 which has the food replaced by drinks or panties or whatever. Not fun and not really a game.Conclusion: What there is is fine but there is almost nothing here. I think the developer could use this as the basis for a good game but he or she would need to add a LOT more to it.I bought it for $1 and I guess that's OK but it is disappointing to see so little content..."

It's basically you just running around a club with terrible animations, and when you approach a person with a problem marker, you click either an option for +cash or +reputation (experience).  There is a mini-game where you click things that drop down, but it lags and sometimes doesn't register the click."

76561198169378044,Recommended,558870,28994610,Posted: 3 January,all,Buddy Dee's Ghost,"This game reminds me a little bit of an old Sierra product called Casino Empire.  In both games you build a den of inequity, make money, upgrade the surroundings, etc.  Yet thats where the similarity ends.  As one might expect, the Sierra product was an all-around game.  In Casino Empire, you could get raided by the police or competitors.  You were sometimes timed for rewards and stuff.  NPCs had unique personalities.Club Naughty plays much more like a sandbox than a game.  You're not being timed and eventually, you will uncover all the upgrades with little or no challenge.  If theres an AI hidden away in there, I certainly don't see it.  Anyway, why do I give it a thumbs up?  Because it's fun to play in a sandbox filled with crappy animated T and A sometimes!   Look for it like 50% off."

I want to support developers who take the risks and put out a game like this.This game is two faced in an interesting way. It is fun to play; who doesn't want to become a strip club owner and walk around thier own 3D animated club. Lots of women, lots of different stages, you can even check out the dancer treading water in the hot tub. It is also a  little annoying to play because you have to attend to customer complaints and employee requests, which isn't bad except they repeat pretty quickly. I have heard complaints that the mini game is too hard. Yes, it is hard (I assume some people like it that way), that's why I went to Source Forge and got an auto clicker for free. In a game like this it's not cheating, it's just another opportunity  :)This game has nudity and detailed 3D characters, but they are not cute or beautiful. It has a style of art that I am going to call atmospheric. It is to me a little on the dark side. I will probably go on to get all the in-game achievements because, with a little help from a clicker it is easy to progress."
