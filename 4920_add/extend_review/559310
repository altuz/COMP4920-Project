I encourage you to check it out.https://elgea.illyriad.co.ukSecondly, what you are paying for here is what in game is called ""Prestige"" it's a premium currancy that allows you to speed certain things up like building, or boosting resource production. Understandably some people may find this feature to be a ""pay to win"" style of play, however, there's a massive time sink involved with research that has to be done with each and every single one of your cities. Research can not be sped up.Production can also not be sped up in the terms of spending prestige to do so. Plus you can get 1 free prestige per day, and most of the speed up options only cost 3.Pros:1. The community on the game is absolutely amazing. I have met more friendly and helpful players in this game than in the last 16 years of online gaming.2. The game is fairly easy to pick up, follow the tutorial, and check out a couple guides for more in depth knowledge.3. The premium currancy is given out for free just for logging in once every day.4. The map is insanely huge, with tons of territory to claim for yourself, or your alliance.5. The political system is intriguing and fun.6. Trading within your region is easy.7. Even the large alliances are willing to help out new players.8. Great depth within the game and plenty of avenues with which to play by.9. The steam sound track is enjoyable.10. Four races to choose from with different play styles.Cons1. No animations or sound effects for things within the game.2. It takes a long time to get established within the game. (i love this fact, but some more casual folks will not.)3. The game can be daunting for anyone not familiar with grand strategy games like Hearts of Iron, Crusader kings 2, or the like.4. The learning curve can be steep. Although the information is readily available, a lot of the generation of need it now will find it less enjoyable with out a little bit of research.5. Sometimes in the game you will end up in a time sink where you are unable to do anything but wait. I use these times to play other games, or attend to that weird thing called life.6. It is rooted in a browser game style. I tend to avoid these games like the plague as they are usually just money sinks, but after looking around in game, and researching, I find that this is not like that. However, due to the browser origins, there's not much to look at in terms of animations, and things you might find in games like Hearts of Iron.All in all I have been playing the game for a little under a week now, and love it. I feel that the game will keep my attention for quite some time into the future. Given that you can check out the game completely free you really have nothing to lose. Though for the cheep price here on steam you get the music sound track and plenty of the premium currancy for half price of the normal.If you enjoy grand far reaching slow burning strategy games this is one for you."

Many who stick with the game make plans for themselves that stretch out this kind of length of time.  The reason I do not recommend it is because the community politics have already cemented themselves in place, and there is nothing that will ever make them budge.  If you play this game, you can make your own magnificent collection of cities, but the status quo have already determined the rules you must play by.  These rules mostly concern aggression.  If you like PVP builder types games, the community has determined that you may only attack someone who agrees to join in a war against you.  If you disobey this rule, they have the capability to crush you.  This is not something that has happened to me, but it is painfully obvious how long it has taken the strongest players and strongest alliances to grow.  Whether you do agree or not to what I have stated, all would agree to the next few statements.If you want to be a peaceful player in a game that will take years of your life, this game is definitely for you.  If you are not sure what you might want to do in this game, you may not stay for long.  If you like consensual PVP, you may like this.  If you like the contest of war in its purest form (no rules) you will not last.I, unfortunately, am of the last school, so I cannot recommend this game."

76561198041045128,Not Recommended,559310,30360483,Posted: 6 March,all,4L0N3,"I have been playing this game almost since it's beginning. The community shapes this game, and it has been at different stages throughout it's life...sadly though, I am writing this review as a eulogy. I truly believe that the move to Steam before being ready was the last nail in the coffin for what could have been the greatest strategy game of all time. Now, the game is met with sup-par development and dedication from the staff, false promises, and a growing veteran pool that makes growth for this game look more like mold on a cadaver than a fruit bearing tree. Despite the communities growing interest to support the game, for free even, the devs seem to have no interest of expanding their staff or following through on the multiple promises for advancement that have been waved in front of the players faces like a carrot for years.  As a new player, the game itself is already overwhelming for most, so the move to Steam fell embarrassingly short simply because the game is stagnant and the devs released a dead game to hoping it would be resurrected.I have seen this games potential, and it's no longer there. Not that this game couldn't be taken from the incompetent devs to  skyrocket it's success to new extremes, but it's not going to happen. The devs are distracted or non existent, and they have other projects they value much more, so this game is dead by their choice specifically. The only people playing now are attached. Addicted perhaps, but no new players will stay longer than a year. The moment they see that the game is dead, they'll be mad they ever started playing.At best, this game has 700 players on at a time, and their one server is a global one. Just to put that into perspective, about 25% just leave the game running, so they are afk, another 25% of that number is alt accounts logged on simultaneously, also mostly afk, and the rest are new from Steam, destined to leave within the year. Just do yourself a favor and skip this one. The community used to be generous and mature, now it's just a bunch of sour old people that are too technologically inept to play anything apart from browser games.It is painful to leave this review. I have many friends within the community, but after several times butting heads with GMs and having left and come back twice, (starting fresh to understand both the veteran and new side of this game...) I have seen that this game belongs in the ground so we can all move to the new age version."

Not like any 4X game I've ever enjoyed.Honestly, had it not used the phrase 4X in the title and had I been more aware that this was one of the resource building games that have taken off on handheld devices I would have given this one a thumbs up. There appears to be an awful lot of depth here.Buy it by all means, but be aware that after a short amount of play time you will have to log off in order to let your resources accumulate, and that the exploration aspect of the 4X that you expect to be doing early on is pretty much non-existant."
,Not Recommended,559310,31920931,Posted: 23 May,all,Boxsack667,"this is basiclly a Browsergame. It is originally free to play, in the Steam Version you pay for a premium Account and additional Premium Currency as well as the function of ""Steam Achievments""."
,Recommended,559310,29833683,Posted: 10 February,all,M E X A D D O N,"First of all, the title of this game is very misleading. This isn't a 4X game at all. It's a browser-building game that, despite it's depth, still doesn't break itself free from it's grindy core.You do not eXplore or eXterminate. There is no exploration whatsoever, the full map is revealed already. There's no extermination at all, since the community has taken a pretty ""pacifist"" attitude as to not scare new players away. You are seriously berated if you attack someone who is active in this game, veterans might gank on you if you decide to go that way repeatedly. For one, this is great if you're starting. Everyone gives you resources and everyone treats you nicely. However, if you are looking for a brawl later on, you'll find yourself terribly disappointed.There's also, as you might have expected, not an ending. This is a game of YEARS. Not days, not months, YEARS. Just to get your first city going in this game takes weeks if you don't buy/use prestige.I recommend this game for those who take and enjoy it as it is: a free, browser-based, spare-time, chat-room time-killer game. It's supposed to be played while you do other things, to distract you from time to time, not to be taken as a primary source of entertainment. I do not recommend it for people who don't like sitting for hours watching the paint dry while chatting with strangers.Side note: If you expect something special about the Steam launcher, don't. Besides achievements, full screen, 5 tracks of music and improved chat room, there's nothing different from the browser version. You're indeed just paying for 200 in-game premium currency."
76561198128163488,Recommended,559310,29263177,Posted: 14 January,all,Rook,"Alright, let's see.This is a game that runs in the same strain as games like Evony, Travian, Etc.... If you aren't interested in this style of game, This one won't get you into this genre either. You either like it or you don't.Before you scream ""PAY TO WIN!!"", no. This game is not. And that's probably one of the things that sets it above other games in this genre, that and it's outstanding and mature community. This is not a game you have to throw money at in order to play at a high level. You don't have to spend any money at all, or even use prestige. Should you so wish to use prestige, you can purchase it with in-game currency (And it is not impossibly expensive in-game to buy!), and any options using it are very cheap, so it will last you a while any way you get it. You also get the option to gain 1 prestige daily, and considering that 95% of options that use prestige cost 5 at the most, you will still be able to use prestige perks fairly regularly, even if you are a free player who decides not to buy prestige with in-game gold.With this said, I can safely qualify my statement that this game is NOT pay to win. You don't have to spend a dime, and you can still be the best. But I will still recommend you to buy this on steam. The amount of prestige you get is very generous (225!), and this game is worth supporting just on principle. $4-5 is very cheap.That aside,THE GOOD:-First and foremost, excellent community. People in this community have a high level of maturity and are very friendly and helpful. They will send you gifts. They will shower you with advice and acceptance.-FAIR RL money (Prestige) system. You cannot gain an insurmountable advantage using it, nor do you need to use it often at all. At most, you can gain a temporary 10% boost to attack or defence on 1 specific unit type made in 1 specific city. Given the game mechanics involved in war, it is entirely possible to outplay/nullify such a minor advantage. Skill and timing beat brute strength. Prestige does not change this.-HUGE map. 4 million squares total. Really impressive size, gives plenty of space for players to set up their own kingdoms.-Actual lore-Warfare is not 100% mandatory. You can engage in it at your leisure. People here are polite enough that you are unlikely to be assaulted for no reason, especially as a newbie. People will actually come to your defense if a troll tries to siege you and harrass you just because you're a newbie and can't defend yourself. Once again fantastic community.- THE BAD-The map has a dated aesthetic. This is not necessarily a bad thing, some will find it quaint.-They still have some kinks and oversights to work out with their steam client. I would imagine that this will be fixed soon.-The game can be slow as molasses at times, once again not necessarily a bad thing.Overall I think this game is really worth a try if you're willing to give this genre a chance."
76561198133251638,Not Recommended,559310,33341897,Posted: 7 July,all,Larry_Nesko,"Before going into why I cannot recommend this game, let me point out that there are a couple of positive aspects to Illyriad.  First, for a MMO, the game's community is exceedingly welcoming to newcomers.  Many of the established players are willing to answer basic questions in the chat, and even provide early game resource donations.  The game world is suitably large and there is a strategic depth to the game that requires classic ""guns vs. butter"" decision making.Those things said, there are two components of the game that prevent a recommendation.There is absolutely a P2W aspect to the game.  It's not overbearing, but it is there.  There are time gates to facets of the game; things such as building construction, resource gathering, trade and others all occur in real time.  If you want to avoid the wait, you can ""rush"" the completion of these tasks by spending Prestige (the in game currency that is available for purchase).Of course, one can play the game in such a way that rushing construction and so forth doesn't make too big of a difference.  If you are of the mind that you simply wanrt to develop a network of varied cities, conduct research, gather resources and so forth without engaging in the PvP, you can certainly do so (so long as one of your more established neighbors doesn't get itchy and decide you are a prime target).  However, that brings up the second critical flaw.As you constuct your initial city, you will be able to research certain technologies that allow for varied buildings and units.  This is all worthwhile as it forms the foundations of what your city can produce.  However, once you have progressed enough to settle a second city (and start thinking about the new tenor this city will possess) you are met with the fact that you have to start all research over again.  In other words, even though you researched the Militia technology in the first city (a necessity), you have to research it again in your new city.  Seeing as the object of the game is to create and foster an integrated kingdom, this mechanic makes absolutely no sense and is unnecessarily frustrating.In the end, if you are looking to engage in the social aspect of a MMO, Illyriad is probably as good a choice as any other.  However, if you are looking for a game that provides a sense of progression and proportionate reward for effort, this game will likely disappoint."
76561198359509409,Recommended,559310,29365312,Posted: 19 January,all,Inannah,"I've been playing browser war/strategy/building type games (Evony, Lords of Ultima, Ikariam, Tribal Wars, and quite a few others for years). One of those literally for 6 years every day. I can honestly say Illyriad is the most mind-blowing browser game I've found so far. Infact it's got more content than many installed MMO games I've paid for.There's so many features in this game that I'm not sure I'll ever find them all. Unlike pretty much all of hte other games, you don't just build up the same stuff as everyone else and whoever has the most (or can use them the best) wins. You actually can't build everything in a city on this game. There's so many different buildings you can't fit them all in a single city, and so many weeks/months of different research that you most likely wouldn't ever finish it all - I could be wrong on that point.I've only been here a few days now, but the community is a throw-back from the internet's much kinder and more mature years. Global chat is welcoming, helpful, and respectful. It's also ridiculously active. Even at 3-4AM there's people out there chatting away. I've seen a couple spats break out between the vets, but they were still handled without the name calling and flaming you'd see on every other game these days. Just saying ""hey"" will often get a new player drowned in incoming free resources. I've not ran out of anything yet, and I've not asked for anything. You also won't be pounced on and killed when you get out of newbie protection. It's just really so refreshing to see respect and people that genuinely care about the long-term viability of a multiplayer game these days.For those new to these kinds of games, or unsure of whether they could handle learning the potentially overwhelming amount of content, don't be afraid. The community has also made a TON of guides on the forums, everything from where to start, to advanced topics. There are also training alliances to join that exist solely to teach new players the game and graduate them onto their future ""real"" alliance. Even the folks in global chat will answer your questions happily.For those vets of browser war games.. this one has more than just war available. There are weapons, armor, and critters craftable to use with your army or other crafting. There's a magic system. There's quests. There's tons of different troops. There's a building and research for everything you could imagine and a lot of stuff you couldn't. I'm not sure if there's a total number of cities limit, but if there is it's pretty high.This game is not greedy. It's not pay to win. You get 25 prestige (in game currency) just for starting. You get another 200 for playing on Steam. Prestige is used to speed up buildings, cavarans that are marching to/from you, and provide minor boosts to production for a length of time. You can't buy troops or research or anything game changing with prestige. You won't be obliterated by someone outspending you. And if you do decide to spend, it's cheap!You can play this game free on the browser, or you can buy it on Steam. I started on the browser to see if I liked it first, then bought it on Steam the next day. It's absolutely worth buying it on steam, the 200 prestige is a big help in getting you going faster. If you started on the browser and then buy on Steam, you CAN keep your account. Just link them when Steam gives you the option.---------------------Some CONs:I'm not gonna lie, this is not a quick game. This is a game for people looking to casually play long term and build up their stuff. If you need instant gratification or immediate wars, this is probably not the game for you.You will start as a newbie amongst monster sized players that have been here for years. Don't let that intimidate you. They're not gonna bother you, they will help you build up. They will shower you with love because they WANT you to play.The interface is a bit clunky in some places, it's not that they suck at GUI making, it's more that there's just so much stuff they have to have menus under menus to fit it all, lol. I figured out where to click for what I wanted by the 2nd day, so don't let that scare you off. I gotta admit I spent my 1st day clicking everywhere trying to remember where I saw whatever I was looking for. It does have a newbie tutorial that guides you through building a few things and such, you'll likely forget half of what it said by the time it's done. At least.. I did :)The world map is crowded with graphics. It makes it hard to find resources or goodies on the map to loot. Unchecking the ""terrain"" box makes it a thousand times easier. Once you remove the images of mountains, forests, etc. then it's all clear and good.---------------------Overall, I'd highly recommend this game if you're into these kinds of games. I'd also recommend checking it out if you're unfamiliar with these kinds of games."

It may be a better game than I give it credit for if you put in the time, but I also get the impression you will never catch up to those who started before you unless you pay money (since you will either have to wait the same amount of real world time they did to unlock things, or pay money to complete things instantly).  And since the community already exists from the ('free') browser version, you are at a massive disadvantage.I would suggest trying the browser version before buying it (which only gives you 'prestige,' the ingame pay to win currency) if you are interested."

It also starts you out with a 7 day newbie shield (No one can attack you) and starts you in the ""newbie ring"" a ring of other newbie villages. It's also worth noting that people don't tend to attack unless provoked.I was also surprised by the depth of the game. There's 4 races, each with their individual unique units and traits.

While the build times do line up with many clicker/builders on the cell phone market, to me, it fits within the overll arc of the gigantic maps slow evolution. I usually get bothered by that stuff, I don't by this.The other comments about cool community can be affirmed. Since I don't want this to just be a love letter, I'd say there could be more to do in your first week or so and it could use more variation of tiles/sights to really see. Still, overall A plus.

It is NOT a scam, nor is it a PTW- and if you think it is, then just don't play it- simple as that. Yes, I'll buy Prestige- but only to help speed up some buildings, and/or building times.I suspect most who give this game a negative review, are the ""lock and loaders""- the ones who prefer to play a ""war"" game where they can build up to the killing part in a few weeks, or maybe a month.Illy is LONG term. It is the most complex RTS I have ever played. It also has the most freindly community of any other game I've played- idiots will be hammered very quickly, veteran players will happily send you resources if you ask (politely) in GC.I've never been able to dedicate as much time to Illy as I needed to- but this time, I'm here for the long haul.Illyirad is definitely NOT a FB game *laughs*"

The chat rules essentially amount to ""If we don't like you or what you say, we'll ban you from chat"". Arbitrary subjective standards of what you can and cannot post in chat amount to a chilling effect which I cannot abide by in games, especially where chat seems necessary to move forward in the game.That being said, it seemed like an interesting game. If you don't mind having to kiss behind in chat to avoid getting banned from it, and you like these kind of web games, by all means check this game out."

76561198097794936,Not Recommended,559310,31692408,Posted: 11 May,all,LilDagnamet,"The game is fun but the community that is in the game can or should I say has ruined the playability of this game. However, this game is not all bad. I'll do some pros and cons to keep it simple.Pros:- Community both in a guild and outside a guild are very helpful to one another and help new players get off to a great start- Graphics are perfect for the game, this is not a game where they try to push the graphics past what is right for the game- Content! There are multiple playable races, climate zones, huntable creatures, units.- Back story/lore. There seems to be a storey/lore if you are willing to look for it.- Real time play - with anything taking real time to do it means you are not stuck infront of your computer or device for extended periods of time.Cons:- The community is stuck in a non-aggressive state of play where no one ever attacks anyone else, ever. While I am not big on PvP this seems weird to me in a game where PvP is an eventuality- Soverity is basically a tool that allows anyone to place a visable claim on any square, even resource squares. This then allows them to possibly nagociate mining rights with other players for a ""fee"". This is not nescessarily a bad mechanic but it is an annoying one since the next resource square of the same type might be 2-3 times the distance away.- The freemium design of the game - Just don't like it but do understand it especially since I had to pay 5.49 for a game on steam that is a free browser game"

If your new to the game just type in the game chat "" Hello Im new! "" and watch the people send you resources to help you further your first village. The community strongly opposes noob bashing so you'll very easily be able to build up your starter town. The game is very similar to Stronghold Kingdom's. You que and wait for your troops,buildings, research, and the like to unfold. The game does have ""prestige"" which you can purchase for real life money, but it is definitely not a pay to win game as the benefits of prestige are not game altering. You can get the game free via their website, try it out for free and if you like it come back and buy it through Steam. This game isn't for people who dont have patience and it takes time to build up your kingdom. Would recommend this game as its fun, and relaxing."

If you like this type of game, you'll be quite satisfied with Illyriad. Its really about knowing what to expect. To be happy in this game you should be aware:- This game is primarily a ""city-state"" builder. the successful players seem to build a network of cities, which take months...putting in a little effort with multiple sign-ins per week.- This game is not one for folks that want to quickly become a ""top player"" in the game. Top players - those with large empires, have been playing for months or years.- In spite of that, a new player can be comfortable and experience everything pretty much without fear of getting wiped out by some ganker. This is because:- the community is very friendly and welcoming to new players. They know they need them to keep the game going.- while there is a currency you can buy, there is no way you can use the currency and ""pay to win"".  I could spend $500 and nothing I can do will allow me to suddenly become powerful in the game. The game mechanics simply won't allow it (all progress eventually ties to your level of research, which cannot be sped up)- After spending my $5, I've not used more than 20% of the currency I bought - and doubt I would ever need to buy more. Frankly,- One drawback of these games is that you need to log on periodically to keep production, etc. going, but most of us have a life to live. As an HTML5 game, you can log on with any browser. It works tolerably on my phone (at least enough to queue up production, etc.) I've played it on iOS, Android, and Windows. That's a nice convenience. (Getting more common - but thought it worth mentioning)- Wars - if you want constant battle - find another game. While I hear that there have been some pretty nasty wars - I also hear they were very specific battles between particular alliances. So far, the several thousand players have been largely at peace.So, if you are a ""patient"" game player that likes to spend time thinking and planning while building up a network of cities that gather resource and support your friends, you'll probably be happy here."

There is a long learning curve and a lot that is not intuitive. That said, it was entertaining enough to keep checking in and playing just a couple hours per week. Eventually joined a guild and got to know some people and have ended up enjoying it quite a bit. It doesn't take up too much time, unless I want it to. There are several facets to the game that allow for different play styles. I would recommend joining a beginner's guild or doing a lot of online research before jumping in, it will save you a lot of frustration.  Pretty sure I bought it on one of the weekend specials, so not full price, but happy with it overall."
76561198213433584,Recommended,559310,33680018,Posted: 20 July,all,SobekPrime,"Although I have only owned the steam version for a couple of days I have been an Illyriad player for the past 3 months and I absolutely love this game.  When I set out to find a browser based game I had a couple things in mind: Fantasy setting, decent presentation, doesn't DEMAND much of my time but could occupy it if I wanted to, has an interesting mechanic, and has a good community.  Illyriad passed this test with flying colors.Illyriad as a setting is an amazingly vast space with so much varied terrain and just enough fluff to inspire your own imagination.The graphics are simple but well presented.The demand on your time can be as little or as much as you want.  If you're away from the game for a few days your cities will be fine (most likely).  If you're worried about that and you have made a couple trusts worthy friends in game they can sit your account for you until you return.  Once you have settled a couple cities and have built them up there is so much you can do with diplomacy (mostly spying), building, researching, crafting, selling, and , oh yes, war.The mechanics work and are deeply layered in this game.  You can't learn it all in one sitting but if you take it a little at a time you'll eventually understand.  Nothing is very complicated but there are many simple mechanics at work with most in game activities.  A key thing that you must learn is that TEAM WORK is the backbone of this game.  Not graphics,  micro transactions, celebrity voice acting, nor unique game play... Its team work.Which brings me to community.  Illyriad has an outstanding community.  It is so full of helpful and friendly players.  When I first started I was given a very sizable shipment of goods just for asking a question in global chat.  There are a lot of charitable people in this game.  However there are some who are not so.  There are militarily aggressive alliances as well as peaceful training alliances. Both have their place and I enjoy a world that allows me to construct these intricate cities but also presents a reality where they could be under threat.  I'm not trying to write a guide but I do urge new players to research the player alliances and pick the best one for you.I think most people that give up the game or who don't like it are ones that tried to go at it alone.  People sometimes complain that there is no real PvP.  That is a complete lie.  There are always attacks going on.  And if you want that PvP you can have it.  The problem is if you go at it alone and choose your targets carelessly then you will be confronted with the awesome might of one or more of these alliances.  That's not the work of the dev's.  That's the community.  If you can't accept that, then this game may not be for you."

Pay to play is not too helpfull, just allows you to complete projects faster but leaves you lacking in another area so works out you really don't need to spend any real mola!Game is really cheap (On sale at the moment) and if you purchase here from STEAM, you get a really good prestige bonus too which is the pay to play resource people purchase for real money.Crafting is what I like the most because there are so many specialised areas, your goods will be in demand! Troops and commanders gain in exp as they fight rogue beasts or other players armies. You gain crafting matials from these beasts and also you can scrounge for equipment after a battle (not necesserily your own battle). to equip your commanders and army with or sell on the market. THERE IS A LEARNING CURVE, LOTS TO TAKE IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS.Lots of content here! Really great deal for a fun immersive game, and if it's not your cup of tea, no big loss.UPDATE: Don't buy unless you're looking for a good game to play on your phone.

But this is absolute garbage.-The interface is clunky.  The graphics need to make up their mind between being purely functional (like in Travian) or being aesthetic.  It's a horrible mix of both.  The map is just garbage to look at.  Rather than pick between pretty but slightly less functional or purely functional (i.e. just having a key and having shapes/symbols on a grid make up the map) the devs chose to incorporate the worst of both worlds.  So you have atrocious functionality and an eyesore of a map where they just repaste the same clipart mountain/plains/forest.  What's more they mix two and sometimes even three art styles and it's just visually displeasing and even somewhat upsetting.-Chat client takes up half the screen.  Can you make it smaller?  Of ♥♥♥♥ing course you can't, don't be stupid!-You're being asked to pay for a game... that is pay to win.  It's a freemium game that ISN'T. EVEN. FREE.  Right?  Right?!I love browser games along this vein so this game felt like a personal injury.  As much as I wanted to learn about the mechanics I actually physically couldn't make myself play for more than about eight minutes as the above realizations dawned on me.  Trust me, I tried.  And I love Utopia, which has NO graphics and is all just text-based.  I'm fine if you go minimalist like Utopia.  I'm fine if you go all pretty like Dominion or a couple others that slip my mind now.  Just, for the love of God, don't hamfistedly try to do both and fail.I rarely, if ever, give negative reviews.  This is an exception.  I have applied to return this game on principle (it's admittedly cheap) so if it doesn't show that I own it, that would be why."
