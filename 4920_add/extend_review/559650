,Recommended,559650,32148023,Posted: 3 June,all,Scythe Plays,"A better version of Prop Hunt.Witch It is a team based multiplayer game with two character roles.The Witch can transform into various physics objects in the environment such as tomatos, bowls or giant slices of cheese.The controls take a bit to get used to as you roll around the environment or try to hang onto a wall as a painting, but once you get the hang of it, it's a lot of fun!The Hunter searches out and destroys Witches by attacking the ""prop"" items in the environment with long range shots (that can overheat if spammed), or a melee attack.Each side has different abilities you can unlock.Witches start with levitation, allowing you to fly for a short period.Unlocks include an ability to right click and control a mimic witch who walks where your mouse cursor is..or a poison spore that drops on the ground and any hunters caught in the blast will have their movement / mouse controls reversed. After playing for a while, I find the spore more annoying than fun. I'd like to see it changed to a smoke bomb or something because with how laggy some servers get, inverted controls is a bit over powered.Hunters on the other hand start with a chicken throw ability. The chicken will tumble around and start screaming at you if a nearby prop is a witch.Unlocks include a grappling hook which allows you to pull yourself to walls, roof tops and even props! In a lot of ways this ability is required as some maps have areas witches can hide that you can't access without the hookshot (or at least it's very difficult without one)..The final ability lets you throw garlic / an onion which will cancel any witch ability who is in the area. This ability can also stick to props / witches.Now that we've got that outta the way, let's talk about how many maps you get for the price.2 snow maps (one of which isn't particularly fun), the snow moves as you walk in it which is very cool and can help you find hiding props.2 vibrant green maps, one of which is a mansion with a hedge maze outside.2 night maps (one is just a night version of the mansion map but doesn't let you go outside).More maps are planned, so hopefully it won't take too long to see more and hopefully the game will some day support custom maps with steam workshop.FINAL THOUGHTS:If you've ever played Gmod Prop Hunt, you'll feel right at home with Witch It.The props have a few different sets they can cycle through on each map, so you won't always see a pumpkin spawn in the same place each round and holding SHIFT as a prop allows you to adjust yourself based on where your mouse is looking, giving you a lot of control for hiding.It's good fun playing online with strangers, but having a bunch of friends to scream at in a custom game is where the real fun is had as you drop down hints to finding each other. Definitely worth the asking price!"

The graphics look nice and the maps are pretty good. The leveling system means that players that play a lot will get rewards to customize their hunter or witch. All the gamemodes so far are fun and seem pretty balanced.

It's been streamlined, bugfixed, and tweaked to the point of having some really interesting, arcade-y gameplay.  No team feels dominant, no playstyle feels overpowered - there's no glitched out hideyholes and no abusable loopholes.  If you had even a passing interest in the GMod gamemode, please play Witch It."

,Recommended,559650,32533388,Posted: 18 June,all,crap at the game but,"it's a good game, a damned good game. the catchphrase ""prop hunt done right"" has stuck to it because, well, it's an accurate description, and the devs are active in the community. the price is also really good.there are numerous maps, and there are more playmodes being developed. definite win. about the only negative to the game is the fact that there aren't any dedicated servers in Australia yet, but there are plans for that to change, and considering the size of the dev team and budget that they have, that's completely understandable. as you can see from the pictures at the top of the page, it's a very cartoonish style, and for a prop hunt style game, that's ideal.EDIT - there are now Australian servers for the game.it's not the lightest on resources, you'll need a fairly heavy GPU to be able to play it at 1080p60fps on ultra settings, but that's because of the fantastic Unreal Engine 4 that the game uses. with the settings turned down low it's playable on a laptop from a few years ago. another thing is that at the moment it doesn't support 32bit systems and will only work in a 64bit environment, but that's also an issue with UE4 and it's memory usage rather than the game, and the devs are working hard to fix it.this review has been written less than a month after the game was launched in Early Access, so the negative points of this review might well have been fixed by the time you get to buy the game.oh yeah, the community is also fantastic, there aren't too many toxic players yet, and the devs are also working on systems that will keep things nice and friendly.see you in on the hunt!"

It's a hide and seek game with the ability to transform into objects in your surroundings.Honestly I see roughly a 50% win rate for both witches and hunters so far.  Hunters do slightly better in mobification, witches do better in the standard mode (whatever it's called).There's 4 talents for witches and hunters and maps sometimes require specific ones.  There's also lots of tricks like portals, ladders, etc. to use to your advantage.I feel like the game would be the most fun with friends, but I've had a good time in random servers so far."

I got right into this game when I first seen a youtuber play it because it was just like playing prop hunt back on Garry's Mod, just way more fun, you could say. I've recommended this game to a good amount of my friends and do I recommend it to everyone else? Yes, this game is worth getting, even in its early access stage, the community is pretty good on discord, and there are a few people who are, bad potatos, in game. The customization is pretty decent so far with the items given to both hunter and witch, and a couple maps and abilities, but the game is being updated frequently. This one is definitely worth adding to your steam library!"

76561198043367368,Recommended,559650,33349391,Posted: 7 July,all,Variant,"Witch It is a game very similar to Prop Hunt from GMod if you've ever played or seen gameplay of that. You have two teams: The Hiders (aka Witches) and The Seekers (aka Hunters). The Witches have the uncanny ability to transform themselves into objects found around the map, henceforth called ""props"" and it is the Hunter's job to find them. It is the Witch's job to simply not be found, or barring that, to avoid being killed before the time runs out.To aid them in their mission, Witches and Hunters are given unique abilities. Currently, with the latest patch, they both have 4. Not sure how in depth of the specifics of the gameplay I should get in a review, but each ability changes how you play the game, whether you choose Flight on a Witch to hide somewhere high above the hunters, or Mushroom Clouds in order to invert their controls should they find you.Currently, there are 3 game modes: Hide & Seek (a classic), Mobification (where caught Witches become Hunters), and Hunt a Hag (a work in progress where Hunters only have a melee attack, and Witches cannot transform). Each one offers a different way to play the game, but everyone has their favorites.In this sort of game, playing with friends is best in my opinion. Especially if you do so over a voice chat such as Discord or Skype. Luckily, even if you have no friends who wish to play Witch It with you, Barrel Roll Games have a public Discord server in which they actively participate. As of July 7, 2017 there are at least 3000 members in it! The community is extremely helpful (if a little trolling at times) and constantly look forward to new players.If you're looking for a game with which to chill out, have a few laughs, and occasionally freak out at getting almost getting caught, then Witch It is a great game to check out. All in all, a solid game with a great playerbase. I'm looking forward to seeing it grow!"

And more so if you have friends to play it with.Pros:- 16 players a game- Nice overall art style and lighting effects- Runs smooth and is very polished overall.- Leveling system with Skin Unlocks and ability's.- 5 or so maps that all have unique props to turn into and cluttered spaces to hide in.Cons:- Currently I feel like the game is already full of people that just hide on tops of roof's or in the hardest to reach places to avoid being even walked past. Some sort of game rule to disable jumping/roof hiding may be interesting.- Skins seem to drop very rarely and I am not sure how many skins there actually are to unlock.- Only 2 unlockable Witch Perks and Only 1 for hunters. Though hopefully more will come!The con's are not really cons, they are just personal opinion and and things that maybe some people may pick up on like I have myself."

,Recommended,559650,35198506,Posted: 25 September,all,Needy,"You play as either theHuntersor theWitchesin this refreshingly silly and cute take on the classic prop hunt known asWitch It.You can play with up to 10-to-16 players online or make a custom lobby with just you and your friends. Regardless of which you choose, you'll be having loads of fun. Additionally, the game offers 6 different maps that can have subtle variations as well an option to randomly cycle the maps.Witch Italso has a decent amount of cosmetics to unlock and player icons, too!Naturally, theHunters'objective is to hunt down and kill all the witches. In some game modes, you simply eliminate them, or you end up converting them into hunters as well. Hunters have a ranged-weapon and a melee-weapon to choose from, in addition to unique powers that you unlock at various levels.On the other hand, you have theWitches. Their objective is to escape, run, and hide for as long as they can, or rather, until the round is over. Witches can transform into many different items which change your health value depending on the size of the object. Just like theHunters, Witches also have unique abilities which can be unlocked at various levels.In terms of anybugs, I've yet to encounter anything noticeable, but the physics can be a bit wonky at times.  There are some quality-of-life updates that would be nice (that others have mentioned as well), such as allowing the Witches to see the names of individual Hunters during the round, allowing Hunters to have more default skin color options, fixing some grammatical errors, adding a tutorial, and maybe adding a longer cooldown in between taunts as they can be spammed a bit. However, I realize the game is still in Early Access, and I'm not currently aware of the size or workload of their development and/or bug fixing team(s).Overall,Witch Itwas a spur-of-the-moment purchase that I certainly have no regrets about. I started off playing with 2 friends that I bought the game for and had fun from minute one. Transitioning to online play was fine, but as others have mentioned, the community is relatively small. I look forward to future updates and hope to see the community thrive."

As a hunter, finding a prop and having to chase them down is amazing. And when you're the witch watching hunters pass by you is a tense, wonderful, feeling, even if scary moment. Most other prop hunt games make playing a hunter/chaser boring and makes me feel like quiting, but Witch It! avoids that by adding in cool skills like the chicken to help keep you going.Witch It! is also a great game to play with friends. If you're both witches, you can hide out together or try to get each other killed. Or as hunters, divide and conquer all the witches as an epic team, and compete to see who's the better hunter. And if you don't have any friends to play with, Witch It! has an amazing community that won't leave you hanging.One of my best buys, I recommend Witch It! to anyone who wants to have some good laughs and nice friends."

If the witches really want to win they can just disguise themselves and stand still for 4 minutes.What this game needs is a goal for the witches. Like ""travel distance X as a team to win the round"" where you get more points the bigger the object is that you disguise at. Or that you gradually lose health when you don't move for a certain amount of time to encourage witches to expose themselves to the hunters. With the witches not having to do anything it is fairly unbalanced and frustrating for the hunters.With the maps being that big the hunters have to have more tools to find the witches (besides the buggy chickens).The rounds where the witches mock the hunters with their taunts and dance in front of them are fun but most of the time its frustrating and unbalanced."

A  group of hunters grunting at each other is hilarious!- You can votekick people (like a spectator revealing hidespots constantly)- All the possibilities with different abilities- Leveling up and unlocking more skins adds that little extra to the fun- Runs smoothly and so far no server/connection issues- Actively communicating developersCons- No music during gameplay at this time- Steam achievements are only for each level up, some additions in the future would be niceOverall, considering the game IS in early access, it's quite a finished game."
,Recommended,559650,34997005,Posted: 16 September,all,Kkittenn,"This game is one of the best games I've played in the last few years. It's incredibly fun, from both sides, because each side (witch or witch hunter) are incredibly balanced, no one is more OP than the other. There are a bunch of different maps and a bunch of different prop layouts as well, so things never get repetitive. It may take a little bit to find good hiding spots, or where to look if your a hunter, but once you master your playstyle it's an addictive and very rewarding game. Barrel Roll Games has a Witch It-specific discord which is incredibly helpful and there's even a section for people to find other people to play with.Pretty much, if you're like me, and in-between games, I HIGHLY suggest trying this one out. If you're on the fence, get in the discord to see how friendly the community is and how fun the game really can be."

Probably the best $12 I've spent this year.Certain things could use some work though. Hope to see some fixed on full release :)- You end up stuck in a lot of situations- Holding ""Left Shift"" rights you, but does not always turn you in the ""right"" way, making it difficult to get proper positioning- The server setting that allows witches to see each other's position needs to be auto-disabled on any map during ""Mobification""These are not complaints, just things I hope get looked into during development."

Love the graphics/art style, and It's a lot of fun .. IF you can avoid cheaters.I didn't have any problems in most of the games I played but I started noticing that sometimes the hunter was finding everyone really quickly. In those games, there was always someone that was spectatiing in the game.You can join a game and not participate. You don't HAVE to play.  And when you are spectating, you can see where all the witches are hiding. I never saw anyone in the in-game chat telling where witches were hiding, but if you were using  a voice chat, like discord or something, with another low life cheater friend, then you could just take turns being the hunter while the spectator just tells you were everyone is hiding and rack up the points and level up. This is a problem.If it's not a mobification game-type, then It's nice to be able to spectate after you get killed so you can at least watch the gameplay but if the spectators can see where all the other witches are hiding then there is the potential for them to tell their friend(s) where they are if they're a pathetic cheating loser. Sadly, as long as there are video games, there will be losers trying to figure out a way to cheat so they can pretend they are awesome and such a high level with all the skills,etc.Funny thing is, during the beta, if you were a witch, you could see the other witches (props) high-lighted if you were near them, but now you can't, so that helps keep people from helping friends cheat if they are participating in the game.  I don't know how to fix this ... maybe just make it where spectators can watch but not be able to see where the other witches (props) are hiding.Like I said , this a really fun game, and most of the games I have played I didn't have this issue, but it's really new and there is a lot of potential for the game to be ruined by low-life, cheating, false-glory vvh0res.  This should be addressed now if they want this game to be successful."

(Once you become a prop, it's much harder to move around, no more simple slides and hops as real physics takes over.) This game is immediately charming and addicting, even at this stage in it's development, and it's player base seems healthy. If there are any drawbacks, it would be great to have seperate chats for the teams, and an improved spectator system... outside of that though... a small, hilarious gem of a good time. Please give it a look and some support."

This game is so charming, a good change in pace from other games. The aesthetics and defined design choices add alot of atmosphere, and for only being in early access, it already has alot of polish and balance. The player customization and skills/abilities add some depth to an easy-to-learn game. The community and players are very friendly as well, this game is just pure and simple fun without the worry of a toxic competitive playerbase. The price is also right on point for such a high quality game."

A great game so far, when I went into the game I expected to have fun for a few hours but I never knew that Hide and Seek could be this fun. It also has a rather active team behind it (you should check out the discord and see for yourself, link can be found on the official site), something not every indie game has. I do recommend to buy it with a few friends or try to tag along with others on the Discord since it is more fun playing as a group (dont ghost tho). But even as a solo it is very enjoyable (18 of those 20 hours were played solo).The artwork is also something which I believe fits the game rather good and adds to the (for a lack of a better term) funkyness of the game.Looking forward to see what the dev's have in store for this game in future patches."

Figure it out :)I used to not recommending the game just because it has no Asia servers and lack of players. I stop at 1.8 hours of game time and thought of refunding the game. After a while I just giving another chance. Idk what magic happen even though my ping is >300ms all the time, on 16/16 full server it ran smooth and never lag a bit.Pros :+ Good art concept.+ Smooth gameplay, easy to learn the game, simple controls.+ I haven't notice any glitches yet, ran smooth with >300ms ping (Asia).+ Pretty balanced matches.+ No P2W.+ Excellent time-killing game.+ Run on low end gaming system with Epic settings (560 Ti).+ Small in size.Cons (and few suggestions) :- No Asia servers only EU/US for now (they will add soon).- Lack of players (marketing team are sleeping).- Hiding time is quite short.- Character modelling is a bit too pixelated especially for Witches.- Could be boring for some after 5-10 hours since it just hide and seek multiplayer game.- Lack of interactivity.- Need AI hunter when there are only 1 hunter in ""Hide and Seek"" mode.- The chat is quite dead, since the people probably for now are full streamers who use voice chat instead (maybe a lobby will help, since there's not many players, people will quit the game on the first impression, if there is a lobby so people will know that there are those who wait for other people to join a server so they can join after or even invite them to the server.)There are more I can suggest but no use to write it here.My score : 8/10-1 for the Asia servers-1 till it gets updated with the most suggested ideas"
