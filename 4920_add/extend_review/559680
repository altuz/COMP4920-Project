,Recommended,559680,32495382,Posted: 16 June,all,Burn,"Spanning from the Dark Ages to the eve of the second millennium, this game delivers the player an epic vampire story. The characters met across the game embody the struggle against the curse of immortal life, all of this being delivered through tons of beautiful lines of dialogue which you won't forget. The obvious flaws with the visuals and a sometimes weird AI behavior and frustrating (though typical for a Hack&Slash game) combat do not undermine an otherwise masterpiece of game history.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=948569061http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=948575869"

The game isn't nearly as good as Bloodlines, but it holds it's own in the series and stands on it's own in the genre.The graphics are outdated and so are the controls, but the story and writing are engaging enough to keep you playing. If you can get past the graphics and controls I think you will be pleasantly surprised with the adventure the game takes you on.This game along with Bloodlines I always end up coming back to play. I have probably a couple hundred hours put into the GOG version. Glad it finally made it to Steam."
,Recommended,559680,33127759,Posted: 2 July,all,SlaveDeMorto,"Reading all these reviews about how dated and old this game is I spent a good time fighting my nostalgia urge and fear of disappointment. Eventually I gave up and bought the copy.The only thing that truly disappointed me is that Steam won't properly record my gameplay time. After patching and fixing the game I’m bound to have 0.1 hrs on record (even though I spent whole day playing prior writing the review).While Redemption holds a huge deal of sentimental value for me, I still consider it a gem of videogame industry that is cruelly forgotten and unappreciated.I'll have to say that I am pleasantly surprised by the writing of the game. Even though the story and lore are great and should be praised, I’m talking about the dialogues and narration. Back in the day when I was just the kid I had a CD with a Russian localization. While it felt perfectly fine back in the day, looking back I feel sorry; Because, boy did I miss on all that gorgeous old english. While the dialogues still follow the narrative as I remember the writing is what makes it so much more.The downsides: some levels are too dark (but I am too lazy to search if there is a fix) ; sounds of character running on grass/dirt/sand are really low quality by today's standarts; some interface elements (such as no description of character stats) is a little bummer too, but internet helped with understanding these. And probably because of my resolution (1600x900) good half of dialogues are focused more on a character's torso rather than upper half of the body. Camera is constantly possitioning itself at the belly level of a character speaking and while there is obviously no cool facial animations to see aside of mouth opening (year 2000 duh) it spoils the game's immersion a bit. Silly camera.P.S. ""Age Of Redemption"" unofficial patch is a blessing."
,Recommended,559680,31268688,Posted: 20 April,all,IMainAsMissPauling,"Wow. My memory was REALLY kind to this game. I was a senior in high school when this game came out. I believe I bought the game within the first month of the original release in 2000. I still have the disks somewhere. But I am so lazy, and this was on sale so cheap that it's easier to spend a couple bucks buying it a 2nd time than it is to find my disks and figure out how to install them.Back then, I was pretty enthralled with the White-Wolf/World of Darkness/V:tM realm. I remember being really excited about this game. And I remember my friend managed to win a treasured spot as a beta-tester and he had to sign a non-disclosure agreement and he talked about how impressed he was with it.I remember thinking the various nitpicky details they got wrong was hilarious, and  remember that the way the medieval characters spoke was cringetastically poorly written. But I remember overall finding the game experience enjoyable.IMPORTANT: if you have problems with everything being dark in the caves, even with brightness on high and with a torch in hand, it's a compatibility problem in DirectX. You need to get the Compatibility Administrator from Microsoft, and build a profile that activates ""DxPrimaryEmulation"". Without it you might as well play the game blind.The graphics are INCREDIBLY horrible. It's from back when pologons must be minimized, and when it made more sense to prerender CG sequences on supercomputers and convert the output to highly-compressed MPEGs. Instead of the last decade where cutting to video files is long long long dead and everything gets rendered locally.The voice acting is usually but not always HILARIOUSLY terrible. The play-control is so bad that I blocked that memory out completely. This game is from a time before we finally figured out that WASD + mouselook was a fine solution in both 1st person and 3rd person. Instead, it's sorta trying to be like 3D Bauldur's Gate. The HUD at the bottom is HUGE. it's like 1/3rd of the screen. This game was before widescreen monitors took over. It had no clue how horrible that was gonna be. The menu interaction is baffling. you can bring up multiple menus at one time...for no reason. you can leave menus up while fighting...for no reason. And while fiddling with menus, someone could sneak up behind you and beat you sensless before you could 180 and counterattack. Thankfully, the AI on this game is braindead. It's the classic ""I will wait for you to kill my friend before I decide to begin attacking you"" insanity.When the game loaded, and I saw the ""version 1.1"" it brought back memories. I do remember being unhappy about some sort of bugs in the 1.0 release. I can't remember what. I remember being extremely grateful for the 1.1 release. But I presumed it was the first of many over the course of six months or so. And I also remember hearing when they announced that development would stop and there'd be no 1.2.This game is now in the realm of GLORIOUSLY so bad it's good. All the struggles to adapt the RPG into the video game realm, all the compromises required to eventually get it released.As long as it's being sold for cheap, I totally recommend this piece of junk. Once you get it working it's really entertaining."

Had about five playthroughs when this was first released.  If you liked Bloodlines, you'll probably like this if you have patience for the age of the game. The inital setting of medieval Prague is my favorite part of the game, and although Assassin's Creed has taken away the novelty of that era, it still gives it a wonderful flavor.For new players: check out the controls in the manual via the store page link. This was before the age of in-game tutorials, so nothing is spoon-fed. Also, allegedly valid resolutions did not work on my PC, so I had to shut the program down forcibly and go with the default. Like Bloodlines, there's a pen-and-paper sensibility about the use of Disciplines, so not every build is equal. This isn't Deus Ex, some build choices will make the game harder."
76561198004369747,Recommended,559680,31251497,Posted: 20 April,all,Lo Wang,"Play this game.  This is a game I've remembered all my life, since it came out.  It has never been replaced by any other game in my lifetime.  There was never a more modern VTM: Redemption.  It's one of those gems that was made long ago and nobody ever tried to replicate it or make a better game.  So, it will always be remembered as a special experience and a gem to be treasured.You'll have to do your best to get past the dated graphics/storytelling and old interface, but it's worth it.  This is a really awesome game.  It's got a heart of gold under that rusty old shell.  To this day, I still have a lot of admiration for the developers who made this game.  I still place VTM: Redemption on my 'Best games of all time' list.  Considering it's been 17 years, that's probably not going to change any time soon.Technical details:This version seems to work fine.  It does have widescreen support, however this widescreen causes cutscenes to be cut off at the top and bottom.  So during the dialogue, the camera will not be placed properly (heads are off camera).  It's functional in every other way, though.  Just chop it up to being an old game and you'll be fine.  There's probably a way to fix it, if you want to do a little research."

,Recommended,559680,31330219,Posted: 23 April,all,Xenovista,"Much like it's sucessor Bloodlines, Redemption is plauged by an extremely clunky combat system paired with rock stupid AI.So why is this game legendary? The lore. Good gods the writing and dialouge in this game is phenomenonal. This takes you back in time to the Dark Ages of The World of Darkness setting. In which you get a glimpse of that world and machiavellian world the vampires thrived in. Your character is a former crusader and his motivations and actions change based upon what dialouge you choose. Oh yeah there's multiple endings, but first you gotta survive modern day New York."

The combat, while not very flashy, is still enjoyable. The graphics naturally look old, but still pretty good for its age, I think it looks quite charming. The OST is great, and fits the game perfectly. This game is a true classic.This version seems to run well on modern pcs. 1920x1080 fullscreen works fine, and the cutscenes look normal, which I had some problems with on the GOG version."

Just started this up so it could unlock the review feature for me, so my few minutes in the game aren't really accurate. this was one of the first games I bought for my first non-Mac computer in 2000, I'd say easily 250-300 hours on it over the next couple of years. Great game great memories. Graphics were great back then and are just okay now but the storyline is fantastic. Also not really an easy game either but that's good - I like the challange. My only complaint is there are not enough save points in the level, you can be stuck for playing an hour or more sometimes, unless you want to lose all your progress. Buy it, if you like a well written game, especially at this price!"
,Recommended,559680,31262206,Posted: 20 April,all,GoldFish (SVK),"Just a quick technical pseudo-review without diving into the game itself:Works fine under my rig (Windows 10 64-bit) on widescreen natively, no additional modding required. Install and play. Mods and tweaking optional.Movie cutscenes are rendered at small resolutions and the main menu looks a bit weird, but the game itself works flawlessly.But you know how PCs are, mainly in regards to running old games on new PCs. What applies to me doesn't necessarily have to apply to you."

This is not because of the story, but because of graphics and sound.The first time I started the game the screen remained black for a good 10 seconds after which I shut it down and restarted it. This time the intro cinematics did play and I got into the menu. From there I decided to change the graphics options to 1080p since it was there as an option. This caused the game to only show me the upper left side of the screen making it impossible to do anything.Another restart was required for me to be able to do things in the menu. I turned on subtitles and started the game since I was afraid of breaking something else by changing more options. The cinematic played (without subtitles!) and here it showed its a bit with the graphics and sound, but nothing really monstrous. After the cinematic though the game once again only showed me the upper left of the screen.Yet another restart, same issue.Restart number 4, now I lowered the resolution which caused the same issue in the menu.Restart 5, I got into the game with the cinematic playing again. Afterward the game once again only showed me the upper left of the entire thing."

I am really a fan and trying to play it no matter what but it is not playable for me because of 2 reasons.1) Battle pause button is fn+page up which is not adjustable in game options.2) Most importantly my save files gets corrupted and can not load to them. I have like 8 save slots which i can not use because they got corrupted god knows why.After this pause button thing, i tried to continue playing because i really like the franchise but this save error corrupted all of my saves and game is unplayable for me right now.Some people are saying ''oh there is this program which u can macro your keys'' ''oh there is this unofficial patch to do that''...

So far that's all the bad I can find within the game.Albeit slowpaced it still is interesting to play, there is a surprising amount of voice acting too.If you're getting this take in mind that it's old as heck itself and to change the resolution as soon as you get into the game, else you'll be dealing with a squashed screen.Is the game good? yes, it is.

However unlike bloodlines .  I uninstalled it as soon as i was finished with it. I had no desire to go through the game again to get another ending .  Unlike bloodlines their are no side quest in this game  you have up to  3 characters who you control  . The majority of the game play is 3 rd person  shooter  style with three or four chachters   where you go into various dungeons and kill  a bunch of  minions  to get to the boss .   At it's present price point of $7.99 Canadian I  would recommend against it's purchase  As according to some negative reviews It had conflicted with antivirus  programs  and been hard to run   I did not have this problem. But then again every ones system is diff rent   That is why I am recommending purchase at a reduced  price   But  for $1.99.   Given the voice acting and story line I would recommend it' purchase .   at a reduced price.A warning of sortsTheir is not any sexuality  in this game  and  It has in my opinion a rather cheesy story line . A Christian crusader  falls in love with the nun who treats his wounds The nun falls in love with him As well But they cant be together because well shes a nun   He becomes a vampire and she becomes a ghoul "" servant to another vampire""  So he track's her across the century's because  ""nothing is stronger that their pure love for each other."""
