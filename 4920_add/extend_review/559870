,Recommended,559870,30783234,Posted: 27 March,all,peremptor,"Loads of fun if you like action topdown racers. I tried the 'free' mobile version and I got to say that it plays a lot better on keyboard or a gamepad relative to the touch controls, not to mention it just looks overall a lot nicer. It also has more gameplay elements such as powerups and weapons which weren't available in what I take is the original game version on mobile.There's the car chase mode as the game title implies but it also comes with specific challenge maps where the objective varies depending on the conditions surrounding the challenge. There's a good variety of cars to unlock and they each have their own handling characteristics though I find that nimbleness and speed depending on the map/challenge are the only attributes that really matter.That plus the multiplayer and co-op modes (local mind you) give the game a lot of value for the price tag if you're a fan of this kind of action."

,Recommended,559870,29165105,Posted: 10 January,all,Jaketin,"PAKO is a simple arcade game in which your only mission is to not be caught by the police or crash. By surviving for a set amount of time in a level, you can unlock new levels, and by completing tasks from Collection you can unlock new vehicles. Also there's local multiplayer, which I did not test out.There are powerups spawning in the levels, such as different kinds of ammo or weirder stuff like meteorites falling from the sky for a few seconds. You can also be affected negatively by picking up them, your car may be frozen for a while, rendering it uncontrollable, or its size might be multiplied for a moment.That's pretty much the gameplay - drive, collect powerups and dodge the police cars (which explode when they hit each other.) One hit and it's game over. I don't like that even the smallest hit with a wall means you lose.If you are into small arcade games, you could pick this one up, however, the game is very simple. I recommend playing with a controller, keyboard can feel a bit clunky."

76561198370428036,Recommended,559870,30213962,Posted: 26 February,all,Plexi,Needs user customizable controls.  Example would be right numeric keys acting as a player 2 in multiplayer while player 1 uses default controls.  Ability to drift with a wider angle just like Pako mobile which allows 2 drift styles per vehicle.  Also online support or at least LAN network multiplayer support.  Android Pako has bugs of vehicle resetting after map reselect.  It used to be most recent vehicle used is first available.  Please kindly fix.

76561198025209623,Recommended,559870,29186767,Posted: 11 January,all,Baenor,PAKO is a great simple game. It has good simple mechanics and great sound track. The game play is addictive and fun unlocking levels and cars. I definitely recommend playing with friends using a controllers if you have them.

A super simple (and super hard) game that makes you retry countless times - and then more.The mobile version was also ok, but this Steam version is a lot more fun with all the extras, especially the multiplayer mode."

Haven't had the chance to try the multiplayer as yet but otherwise found this a great little game, would happily recommend.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOH3SwotuX8"

You basically win by not crashing as soon as your friends for 5 seconds, since everything will kill you and it's almost impossible to avoid without holding the brakes 100% of the time."

,Recommended,559870,30106266,Posted: 22 February,all,Zaney,"A good fun game. It is best enjoyed as a casual game with friends. Single Player is fun and challenging, but there are a couple of cheap deaths, and the camera could be a little bit better, so you better can avoid those cops who comes straight at you.Still a good game, and great for parties!"
,Recommended,559870,30147764,Posted: 24 February,all,Gun God,"Overall great game with an amazing soundtrack. I have had it on my phone for a while now, and I realized that the third/first person mode (the one where you can see in front of yourself) is missing in the steam version. Why?? Its a great addition that makes it a bit easier to know what you're doing. So can you maybe add it in a future update?"
,Recommended,559870,34090701,Posted: 7 August,all,[NAW] BitterSweet,"This game was by far my favourite mobile game. This game doesn't really match up to it's mobile counterpart. Here's what i think of it. NOTE: most of this will compare this version to the mobile.POSITIVES- The music in this game is top notch.- The concept is great.- You no longer collide with already crashed police carsNEGATIVES- Despite costing money, it doesn't have near as much content as the free android version.- You can't change the controls.- The car is extremely slippery.THINGS I WOULD LOVE TO SEE- Please add the content from the mobile versions. This game does not feel complete.- I really liked the way the interface was on the mobile versions.- Despite being a PC game, the graphics are not as good as the mobile.- Add an option to switch between camera angles, one where you're in the car, one where you're slightly above the car, and the original arial viewangle.- An online leaderboard would be great - featuring daily and altime highscores.- I much rather prefered the Credits system.This being said, I have not lost hope in the game or the developers. I've played plenty of Tree Men games, and I've never been let down. Continue to work your hardest."
