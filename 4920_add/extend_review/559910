76561198068554267,Not Recommended,559910,31904896,Posted: 22 May,all,trichotomy444,"As someone who works in the wine industry, I was understandably intrigued by this game, but was a little surprised by how... poorly researched the game seems to be. Before I get into the nerdy wine stuff, I will reiterate what other reviewers have commented on: there is very little to do at this stage in the game's development. You basically sit there watching the clouds go by, then a button pops up allowing you to plant your first vineyard; you choose from 2 grapes, then wait until another button pops up over your Chateau that allows you to harvest. There are a few decisions to make regarding how to ferment, barrel, and bottle your wine, but it doesn't matter for the first several vintages: you're basically going to be making the same decisions over and over, because you really don't get many options, and the options you have don't really make a lot of difference.Now for the nerdy wine critiques: the game is curiously inaccurate. We're supposed to be in Bordeaux, but I'm allowed to plant Chardonnay? When choosing the length of fermentation, the only intervals are represented in months which ""decrease sweetness,"" but a wine can be (and typically is) fermented completely dry in a few weeks, not months. A long fermentation has more to do with the type of yeast used and the kind of flavor profile you want from the wine, not ""getting the sweetness down."" And when pressing the wine, you can choose the ratio of free-run to pressed juice, which is cool in theory, but the game says adding pressed juice ""increases acidity,"" when pressing will typically extract more tannin than acid from the grapes. Vineyard management is also extremely simple, boiling down to just pruning the vines with a mouseclick whenever the canopy gets too dense. The game has a weather system, but it doesn't measure temperature, an extremely important factor in the development of wine grapes.This doesn't need to be an educational game with hyper-realistic viticultural simulations, and I recognize that the game is still early in development and will no doubt have way more features in the future, but at this stage it's really not worth picking up. In my eyes, the whole point of a game like this is to take all the little nuances of vineyard management and winemaking and translate them into fun mechanics. Currently, the game is neither fun, nor accurate, so until they fix that, what's the point?"

Love the tiles and the wine concept, as well as the detail it goes into in perfecting your wines. The economics appear totally broken - you have to guess what loan is allowed through trial and error, and manually make payments on it at the right moment in the game. In my game I made three five star wines in a row and still went bankrupt even without making a single land or upgrade purchase. The UI needs a lot of work to feel finished, even taking into account the minimal feel. The 'magic chest' of rewards animation is totally broken and the opportunities suck; I was told a counterfeiter is copying my wines, and I have to produce poor wine for three years to stop him. How does that make any sense?Huge potential but needs a lot of work."

The game has a relaxed feel to it and the music is pretty soothing as well. I LOVE the graphics. Beautiful game.The problem? It's broken.

These are all fixable and once fixed I will DEFINITELY be back. But can't recommend in current state."

I have not yet run a successful vineyard, but I also didn't watch the tutorial videos, so it's possible that I'm just doing it wrong- the process of discovery is pretty decent (if you like that sort of thing; so far the best strategy for me is to maintain a single vineyard and nothing else for a few years before trying to expand).[UPDATE] After being very select about where to sell my bottles, my income increased significantly, and I've been able to expand considerably. The learning curve is real, but I find the game overall to be quite rewarding."

At the same time, other than the weather, the mechanics in place seem too work pretty well (the only problem with the weather is that you either have rot, too much sun, or - rarely - a great growing year.  I'd think there would be some middle ground where you are neither given a bonus, or a penalty.  In this game it seems to be 90% penalty).Lots and lot of potential, once some content is added and such.  This game looks like someday it may be really fun!"
,Recommended,559910,31969925,Posted: 26 May,all,Cinnamonbeard,"Obviously this game is extremely early in development but what there is of it so far is engaging. It's hard to not get addicted to playing right away and when you hit the ""needs more content/fiixing"" its disappointing in a good way. Also it's got a pretty clean look and UI. Definitely needs a couple quick buttons or indicators (like seeing a visual gauge of wines you have in stock at a glance, and ongoing sales at a glance,) without having to click into the chateau interface every time. Also the pricing structure could be shortened a bit because unless you've played a new game a couple of times you could easily wind up babysitting one tile for a couple years worth of in-game time, and even the faster speed isn't enough to not make it seem like its dragging on a bit.I rarely fully like an alpha game but I'm intrigued and amused by this one enough to stick around for more."

The concept of the game and its visual execution are the strong points here. Some game mechanics are cumbersome at this point, which is to be expected as it is in Early Access and was only released two days ago. I'm confident that if General Interactive Co. stays committed to listening to the people who play their product and adjusts things accordingly, this WILL be one of the best games on Steam by its final release."

Without communicating or fostering an understanding for why we're carrying out various processes or what the scores and values mean, nothing means anything.Basically you're going to lose your first 20 games in the first 4 years and not understand why. You'll occassionally get lucky and get a formula down for having a 4-star batch but as weather patterns shift you'll fall right back into the slump of bankruptcy after a few years.Your success and fun in the game rely almost entirely on luck and I can't recommend a game like that."

It was worth the price for me, but even so I'd say the overall gameplay is relatively simple and there isn't a great deal of depth.Pros:- Unique idea for tycoon style game- Simple, clean art style- Relaxing and fun to play- Has that addictive ""just 10 more minutes"" qualityCons:- Other tycoon games offer more depth for the same money"

It could be a good casual game if not for the difficulty keeping crops going at the optimal quality rating.I'm bothered to no end by the Tutorial link in the menu loading up my web browser to show a list of youtube videos. Really needs an in-game solution with a playable tutorial rather than the dryly-voiced youtube videos.At the moment the game locks up in fullscreen mode, but works fine in windowed mode.

The two big frustrations are:-Making money and reputation in early game (economics in general).  I've gone bankrupt in three playthroughs within the first five years trying to expand.  In order to make more money, you need to upgrade the estate, grow more grapes, etc. but they all cost an exorbitant amount of money making it seemingly impossible to actually make progress.-Rerolling and unlocking tiles.  Even if you just want to ""preview"" which types of soil and land you can unlock, you need to reroll which costs money and that cost goes up each time.  Only after you unlock that tile and pick the soil, that's when you know which grapes you'd be able to grow.Those complaints aside, I think with a few tweaks it could be a phenomenal game!"

Hopefully some more updates will really make this game shine.  As I said fun game and lots of management most in real time.Update after playing on hard even when you get to level 3 this game can keep you on your toes by having a bad run of weather a few years in a row.  Still really enjoy the game but hopefully putting wine in the tavern can become less mircomanagement.
,Not Recommended,559910,31839134,Posted: 19 May,all,Bad Moose,"You might think that 1.3 hours is not enough to make for a good impression of this title but playing for 1.3 hours required a ton of patience on my part and was only possible as I enjoy wine (and didn't finish my Amarone quicker). This title simply doesn't have enough content at the moment to warrant any significant playtime.I believe a title such as this would benefit from a ""Sid Meier SimGolf"" approach where there are at least things happening whilst you wait for, well, things happen. I also think that it would be nice with more wine cultivating information/education tucked in so peeps get more understanding of cause and effect of this work. It is quite shallow as there's no real purchasing, negotiation, etc. of other management sim titles - it only scratches the surface of simulating winery management.Verdict: Yes, it's an Early Access but I would wait for more content before loading it up."

There is so little depth in the game play I thoroughly disappointed. I thought, if I start unlocking new stages in the game, it could pick up, but, unfortunately, it did not. The options are too limited. The game play – unfortunately even if you progress in the game! – becomes too monotonous. Overall, the game is not very exciting. Extending your chateau is not very rewarding, as the new options done add anything to the game play:("
76561198088043156,Recommended,559910,33468186,Posted: 11 July,all,jamespetts,"This is an interesting and unusual game. It has things that are lovely and things that could be improved (note that it is in early access).It has a lovely atmosphere and graphics/music, and an interesting and novel concept. It can be rewarding and relaxing to play, and it is very satisfying when one manages to get a five star wine. However, there is not enough feedback for players in some cases, which can be frustrating at times.In more detail - one starts as a small time wine producer with one plot of ""loam"" soil, on which one can grow one or two varieties (or ""veritals"") of grape: cabernet sauvignon or sauvignon  blanc. The former is cheaper to buy and maintain, and is easier to get good wines out of it.One plants the vines and tends them depending on the weather, which is random, Rain makes the foliage grow, and sun ripens the grapes; too much foliage can stop the grapes from ripening and too little foliage can over-ripen the grapes in the sunshine. Too much foliage in wet conditions can cause rot, which can be cured by exposing the grapes to the sun - but being careful not to over-ripen them.One then harvests the grapes, crushes them, processes the crushed juice and barrels the resulting wine. The idea is to produce a wine that has the right characteristics to make reviewers happy. Some relationships are very clearly explained (e.g., fermenting by x time reduces sweetness by y), but some is not explained at all (e.g. how the ""body"" score is calculated). Perfecting the wine is done by trial and error, and ideal wines for one type of grape have totally different numbers to ideal wines from other types of grape. Also, some wines will be treated as being moderately good if they are close to the ideal range, whereas other wines will be rejected as undrinkable if they are only a slight amount off their ideal range (and those wines will sell for more money if they are ideal).After bottling the wine, one must submit it to reviews before it can be sold. There are different ranks of reviewers, from one to five stars. At the beginning, one can only attract one star reviewers. Reviews by one star reviewers are less harsh on the wine than by higher star reviewers, but carry less weight. The higher the quality of the review (i.e., the higher the number of stars and the higher the star rating of the reviewers), the higher the price for which one can sell the wine. Some types of wine are inherently more expensive than others (but those tend to be the ones that are harder to grow).For every 5 star review that one's wine gets, one attracts one new reviewer of a higher star rating. One then often finds out that the wine that would cause lower ranked reviewers to give it five stars will only get four star reviews from higher ranked reviewers, so more trial and error adjustment is necessary.The reviewers will occasionally give a clue as to what they like about a wine (e.g. ""this has just the sort of thing that a cabernet sauvignon should have - tanins and acidity""), but will rarely do so, and will never do so for a bad review (""Ew"" is the totality of what one gets on occasions). This can be frustrating as it gives no clue as to the direction in which one should be taking the wine. Perhaps somebody with more knowledge of wine would be better at this than I, as I suspect that the game is quite realistic.As one gains more money, one can buy more land and grow more vines - but the more vines that one grows, the greater the risk of pests, which need treatment with expensive pesticides - and as each vine needs to be trimmed by hand (i.e., the player must click manually on a vine with the game un-paused and hold the mouse button for a set time before the vine will be trimmed), managing vines quickly becomes challenging as more are added, and requires upgrades, such as pesticide treatment and the ability to cut all vines of the same type at the same time, which can be researched and purchased (I do not understand for the life of me why an individual farm should be researching its own pesticides).Money management can be challenging - at times, too challenging: one can take a loan, but there is no overdraft facility, and if one misses three payments, the game is brought to an abrupt end, even if one could have borrowed more to start with (one cannot add to a loan once taken out before it is repaid, which is arbitrary and silly), and there are long periods of time when no income is being generated as the previous year's bottles have all sold and the next year's grapes have not been harvested. I advise avoiding loans all together.There is an element of strategy in deciding what to do with poorly reviewed wine, but there is a simple all case right answer that detracts from the ""interesting decisions"" as Sid Mier would have it: wine with a 3* or better rating should be sold to the three main distributors; wine with a 2* or lower rating should be sold to the bulk-buyer, ""Kruppe"". This is because the main distributors will not allow one to sell more wine to them when they still have unsold bottles, and poorly reviewed wine will sell very slowly. Kruppe buys wine at a very low price, but pays instantly (unlike the main distributors, which pay only when the wine is sold), and will take endless vats of the worst possible quality wine without any penalty whatsoever. There is an option to destroy the wine, but there is no reason for a player ever to do this when it can be sold to ""Kruppe"". (""Kruppe"" is a new addition to the game, so there would have been a reason to destroy wine in the past). Selling awful wine through ""Kruppe"" does not seem to have any adverse reputational effect.The early part of the game can be very rewarding and satisfying, although if one grows more than one type of grape, it can be very hard to keep up with what works for each variety, and I found myself getting cognitive overload. The trouble is that one almost inevitably starts with one specific variety of grape, cabernet sauvignon, meaning that, if one wants to plumb the game's interesting depths, one has to end up with a multi-grape vinyard, which, for my multi-tasking unfriendly mind, is rather overwhelming. I ended up having to make detailed lists in Notepad of what characteristics worked best for what types of wine (with one type of wine, this can be memorised without difficulty), and this makes the game rather too much like hard work. This would be alleviated considerably if there were a way of looking back at previous wine reviews and the statistics of those wines so that one can deduce from that what reviewers liked: having to write this down outside the game in order to do well is just silly.There are also lots of features with which one can decorate one's wine farm and purchase for in-game money, but I have still not worked out whether any of these things have any actual function or not.The graphics and sound are lovely, and the game concept is refreshing and delightful. The game can be quite fun despite its flaws, and, given that this is an early access game, there is a possibility (but of course not a certainty) that some of the flaws will be fixed. Given the game's low price, it is worth having a go with, I think."

The devs are really active and read (and implement if possible) the suggestions.So basically you are responsible for making wines, by growing your grapes and managing the amount of foliage depending on the weather. Then it comes down to making the wine and you have some variables to play with in order to find your perfect wine balance. Some reviews say that this is a bit difficult at first, but that is what makes the game challenging. I'd suggest writing a list with wines to see what brings great reviews, and tweak to find what works!I have played around 10 hours so far, and gone bankrupt a couple of times, and got rich beyond belief as well. At this moment the game gets a bit repetitive once you 'made it' and find the right balance of 1 specific wine. The easy way to get past that is to diverify into different wines, where the learning curve starts all over. I would definitly recommend this game to anyone. It looks amazing (really clean design, and intuitive UI), its challenging and rewarding, and the devs are doing a really great job in improving the game with great pace!Don't hasitate any longer, its worth you money for sure and allready very polished and unbugged!** Here's that spoiler incoming**** You sure??**** Its gonna be 5 star white wines...**** good luck! :) **For those that want a head start, aim for all 5's or 6's with a chardonnay and you will be good.."

I don't like that I have been playing for over 2 hours on the same file and still do not have enough prestige to research pesticides, and that my entire land is filled with fruit flies.... :\  which lowers quality which means I have to work longer to get prestige. I have no way to change what is produced, and can only have three types of grapes at any point in time.  It would be nice to harvest each type individually, and the same for the production process. If I ferment one type for an extended period they all get fermented that long even if I specify otherwise.Also sometimes I get stuck waiting for sellers to sell wine, I can understand lower quality bottles taking longer, but my 5* is stuck at the same number for a few months in a row now.Still a good game to pick up though."

This game will crush your winery with bad weather and the fruits of your own mismanagement and then rub your face in the fact that you make terrible wine (the in-game wine critics can be brutal) but eventually you'll become a skilled vintner and see your vineyard grow, which is quite satisfying.

It could use more content but it seems like the developer is active and working away on it, that said i've only used probably about 1/3 to 1/2 of the content in the game so there are still things to do in the game.

It's  challenging, but the potential for success is what drives it all home. Starting with almost nothing is really fun because you have to work with what little you have, then apply it all little by little to become something great."

(Too hard to make money)- Treasure Chest thing.  Has got to go.  Generally negative... like 3 years to ""give"" 3000 bottles to the army.  If you don't do it, you have a penalty for like 10 yearsI'm asking for a refund, will consider repurchasing in the future."

I do hope that the developers keep updating the game though as I feel that the replay value at the moment may be a bit low."

I do wish there was a faster fast forward or higher yeld to make the game progress a bit faster, but the game is in early access so who knows what the finished game will be like. As of now though, I can sadly recommend this game for anyone looking for a nice simple managment game."

Great attention to detail artwise, and a wonderful description in the winemaking process makes this  game fun and enjoyable. HOWEVER the soundtrack can get a little old (after listening to it 2-300 times) overall: 4.75/5"
76561198033446105,Recommended,559910,34477275,Posted: 25 August,all,mikesandwash,"Light and breezy, this game gives you the impression that wine-making is a piece of cake. Think again. Don't let the stylish minimalist graphics fool you. Wine making is challenging! It requires trial and error, patience, and a lot of sucking up to moustached critics. And yet, it's addictive. The reward system is a little slow at the start. When the game picks up, it'll get you clicking away in no time. Best of all, I can now carry a conversation with my boss about tannens and wine distribution (he didn't know what I was on about, but he gave me a very approving nod). Yes yes."

Music is cool too, I end up humming it even after playing. Could use more animations, but pretty sure that'll be in the pipeline. Overall, worth buying!"

It's extremely not fun to have random weather and random events randomly screw up everything from Jan-Dec.  I hate to give a bad review for a new title but if this cost $.01 I would still request a refund."

However the financial system is simply broken! It is impossible at this point to make money in an understandable manner. Also the bank loan system is absurd and confusing. I hope the developers address these bugs before anything else and do not give up on this game."

76561198051421156,Recommended,559910,35433385,Posted: 2 October,all,GreyXephos,"I can't wait for this game to be fixed. I can tell this is going to be a game I invest many hours into. It reminds me of Game Dev Tycoon, which is one of my favorite games. The tutorial is perfect, it doesn't hold my hand but it also doesn't leave me staring at my screen with no direction or idea on how to progress. It only took one miserable failure on my first wine to grasp the concept of how to produce a successful wine.EDIT: Bug Fixed!The only reason I stopped playing is because of the game breaking bug that others have mentioned in their reviews. Money doesn't get added to your account. I will definitely be coming back to this game in full force when the issues are addressed."
