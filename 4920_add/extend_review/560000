76561198000561257,Not Recommended,560000,29212552,Posted: 12 January,all,Evnatia - The Mute Cynic,"Gateway To Gaming Presents:Ladykiller in a Bind, A Visual Novel ReviewDisclosure: This visual novel was bought by the review.Visual Novel experience: Muv-Luv Alternative, Kindred Spirits on the Roof, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender ActionPlease note: I will try to keep this as spoiler free as possible. If you are interested in spoilers, I don't mind explaining in detail with a link to a separate group.The visual aesthetic's quality is a mixed bag, but nothing dips beneath terrible. The backgrounds and environmental set pieces are absolutely beautiful to look at, ranging from the hallways of the cruise ship to the dinning facility and pool tables located in the lounge. Random pieces of art are also included via the third epilogue, which had a couple of noteworthy pieces done in black and white shading. The UI and the option menu are all presented cleanly and in uniform fashion, something I wish a lot of other visual novels could mimic. In terms of the sexual content in this game, it is very tame with simply drawn genitalia (nothing detailed) and the most extreme act being penetration. It is nothing to write home about and due to some serious story issues, feels more tacked on than genuine. Yes, BDSM is also featured, but the use of the crop is never shown, just emphasized by sound effects.Character avatars are shown during conversation to help specify who is talking, but they are all rather similar in terms of build and height. The main menu screen illustrates this best, having each character side by side with their outfits and hair being the only real feature separating them. Faces, unfortunately, also suffer the exact same issue most visuals novels have when dealing with their characters. The faces are interchangeable with no definition to the way noses look and provide the strange case of ""same face, different hair style and eye color. It just feels lazy, a feature that can easily be fixed by giving the time to provide cheek definition. This makes the characters look sterile, clean cut and bland. Thankfully, much more care was given to the outfits that range from spectacular (looking at your wardrobe Boss) to simply quaint. Clothing wrinkles and stretch lines were sown into most poses as well. The game actually uses multiple poses, different angles for each character that helps convey emotion over simply having the assumption from a single avatar. If it wasn't for the faces though, I probably would have given the character artwork a plus.Music, I am pleased to announce, was mellow throughout and never seemed to outstay its' welcome during the short duration of conversations. During times of tension, the tempo picks up and helps carry some scenes that otherwise fall flat from delivered dialog. It is by no means terrible, but once I finished the game for the third time, I honestly couldn't remember any of the melodies used. It would also help if the main menu could feature at least some form of music. Sound effects are minor, mostly given to the pounding of waves against the hull and the swift cracks of the crop. The only major omission from this visual novel is voice acting, which again, leaves the music to help carry scenes. Granted, the developer's other games lacked voice talent, but they were also not $30 dollars.Conversations play a major role in the manipulation game, influencing the way the story progress in regards to the individual classmates. While the main story follows the same script, the player can choose to interact with specific people at special times of the day, adding the chance to garner more votes while trying to avoid triggering suspicion. Each character has dialog paths that can unlock sentences worth of different text and others that are needed to progress down the path to either a peaceful resolution, breaking it off in poor taste or commemorating friendship on silk sheets. Certain conversation options are also blocked that can only be unlocked if certain interactions occur to gain information regarding that character. Options can also open up or disappear depending on how long you continue to listen to a conversation, which can be beneficial or harmful. Honestly, if the player goes to far into a conversation, they can roll back up using the mouse wheel and select a less impactful option in most cases. How can someone tell? Every dialog option has their profits and losses written next too it, which makes deciding on a specific path incredible easy. It also removes any real danger of rousing suspicion (except for one unavoidable situation) and makes the conversations less enjoyable. It is a great system (in terms of removing options) dragged down by unnecessary hand holding and a lack of discoverability.The game also handles the idea of a fail-state poorly. If a player somehow manages to get five suspicion points, the game cuts to the same conversation, the same outcome, then uses the unreliable narrator to reload the same time of day for a retry. This was a missed opportunity to examine the reactions that would have been made, leading to more potential endings and uses of the manipulation narrative. It all feels too ""safe"" in a genre that has given some very amazing story arcs during what equates to a game over. It boils down to a missed opportunity in a disappointing story.Story-wise, this is a mess of a title. This is without taking into account the dialog, the character motivations, the general lack of chemistry and the themes used by the developer (which are all subjective). It takes at least three play-throughs to get all the information needed to understand the main plot and goes from out of left field to incredibly outlandish for what was advertised as a simple story about high school romance and votes. The cruise is simply an excuse to set up the protagonist for the ending and doesn't involve any of the classmates plot wise, which makes the cruise seem more like filler except for the interaction with The Stalker and The Beauty (who wipes away your suspicion points if you decide to submit to her). It is hard to really pin point the issue without spoilers, so I will try it this way: this is two visual novels wrapped into one, with the first being a ""fish out of water"" romance comedy and the second being an origin story to a Call of Duty villain. That is how disjointed and out of place the ending feels, which would have probably just been a good place to start the planned sequel for this game.The core premise also takes a nose dive off the plot-line close to the end as it is revealed the need for votes is arbitrary, resulting in the same ending regardless of how many are acquired. On a side note: votes are needed to unlock certain paths during Day 6 for individual characters, not the main plot. It doesn't help that the chemistry introduced is paper thin (for the actual brother, not the sister). The reason for adding the consequences for certain dialog options was made to help play off the brother, I understand this, but there is barely any relationship or motivations revealed outside ""he is my rival"" or ""I use to date her."" If there were more details involving situations like the unavoidable conundrum I mentioned early, it might have been needed. The characters just don't have a well written history to give off or promoted angles to make them anything but one dimensional.Technical issues are also present on this little lust boat. Crashes have occurred three times during my play-throughs, once for hitting New Game and twice while loading two separate saves. Dialog also has a tendency to repeat itself, as if the scene was meant to be a placeholder for the finished sentence. Music would something play while I was reading something, cut off while I was reading that same page, then start again before clicking to the next page.<---See First Two Comments for Last Part--->"
,Recommended,560000,31711486,Posted: 12 May,all,Scarlett ♥,"If you're a kinkster or have a curiosity about BDSM, Ladykiller in a Bind contains two of the sweetest, most genuine portrayals of dominance and submission that you'll find in media (along with the graphic novel Sunstone, if you're looking for some further reading).Throughout the multiple runs and routes I've played through it has made me laugh, cry, and... well, it made me wish there were more people like the Beauty and the Stalker in the world. And at 15 hours played (at the time of writing, it's almost certainly more as you read this), I know there's still paths I haven't taken and content still to see.It's not a perfect game, of course, there's a few mis-steps here and there as you might expect with the characters and story-- mostly personal preference though: I didn't always agree with the political beliefs and statements of some characters and they ended up feeling a little grating at times, or I agreed with them so much it felt like they were preaching to the choir and stating the obvious multiple times in a row.When a story is this long (240k words in total, according to the internet) you can't expect it to strike gold with every single scene (and it doesn't), nor are you going to agree with absolutely *everything* an author is trying to say (but does anyone really expect to?) When Ladykiller in a Bind is at it's best though, it is so, so good and I consider it to be one of the best games I own on steam. There's a reason I've bought it for multiple friends (and will continue to whenever a sale comes around) and am working on unlocking all of the achievements.Ladykiller was my first introduction to Christine Love, and after playing some of her older work I'm pretty sure she has a fan for life.Now if only there was a guide to help me with the last few vaguely worded achievements..."

I went in expecting a refined and realistic portrayal of sexuality, and I got that, but also a really good story. And characters that won't leave my mind any time soon. And, like, way too many things that I want to try in bed. So, yeah, play this game."

(Mature does NOT mean old)  If anything I would say it it is designed for audiences who enjoy a great deal of creativity, variety, and experimentation in life.This is NOT a game meant for someone looking for thoughtless masturbation material.  For those with active imaginations who enjoy the 'meetings of the minds' part of relationships as much as the physical....this thing is HOT.Just remember fantasy is just that: FANTASY and Consent is a 100% Crystal clear  MUST HAVE in real life, and real world Machievellians are pychopaths."

I do wish the interface was easier to just save and re-load but that is a very low priority complaint. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good VN/dating otome."

If you're anything like The Nerd, then it's most likely you won't enjoy the game to its full potential.From the storytelling perspective, I wanted to find out all of the different paths that could be taken and I felt emotionally invested in knowing the outcome to each of the storylines. After the first playthrough and not really getting anywhere with The Beauty, I really wanted to get an ending where we were together, forever! I was not disappointed. From there, the game had me hooked on exploring all the alternative endings and twists that surfaced depending on your choices.Combined with the amazing music and artwork, made the game feel both retro, but modern. This made the game feel more than worth the cost.I know it's unlikely that there will be a sequel, but I'd certainly love to find out what happens to The Beast in the future!"

Rather than hampering its effectiveness, the realistic quirks keep the game feeling grounded, plausible, and more enjoyable. I'm talking about the sexy bits, just to be clear. The rest of the plot is basically Metal Gear Solid 2. But with a slightly less effeminate lead.I also appreciate that the queer characters (including the main character) are all well characterized and resist falling into stereotypical portrayals. I didn't expect to actually find narrative depth in a sex game, but was pleasantly surprised by the nuanaced characters and gameplay.tl;dr 69/10 gayme of the year"
,Recommended,560000,29176078,Posted: 10 January,all,PantheraMorag,"TL;DR:Pros:Funny, tasteful and erotic storyRespectful and adult portrayal of bondage and sub/dom playKick♥♥♥♥♥lesbian protagonistDiverse, interesting character galleryMysterious plotSocial intrigue and strategic maneuveringCon:The last choice on the ""ladykiller"" route is more uncomfortable and heavy than the light-hearted, sexy nature of the rest of the gameThe story becomes maybe a bit too unrealistic at the end, weering into ""silly for silly's sake"".It's a very compelling mystery up till that point though.The most important thing I can think to say to maybe make it worth a purchase is; it's not exploitative, it's not crude and it's not ""just"" a sex game. If you like well-written visual novels likeSteins;Gate, you'll probably like this game, if you like funny, unique VNs likeHatoful Boyfriendyou'll most definitely like this game, and if you like adult VNs likeComing out on Top, well you might be a bit disappointed by the sex scenes, but otherwise it should be right up your alley (just girls instead of boys).Review:Ladykiller in a Bind is a smart, funny and well-written erotic visual novel with strategic elements, and is an absolute treat to play, (probably) no matter your sexual identity. The sex scenes are tastefully done and not very explicit, the sub/dom and bondage play is handled with a lot of care and respect, and the characters are all fleshed out and written in such a way that you end up caring a lot about them. (Well, most of them. The President can **** right off)Different from a lot of other visual novels, the game includes several strategic dialogue and character choices, where you at specific points in the dialogue will have different, time-limited (limited by progressing the text, not a clock) dialogue choices that impact the story and your relationship with the current characters. You also have a limited amount of ""suspicious actions"" (think Phoenix Wright's penalty system), leading you to balance how you behave and talk based on how much suspicion you've gathered at the time.At the time of writing I've finished one playthrough (getting ending A, and sleeping around) clocking in at around 6 hours, which is a very respectable time for a game with so many choices and side-character routes to explore, and most importantly - side-character routes I -want- to explore. I'm already itching to go back in and finish the Swimmer's route, figure out the Photographer, being friends with the Athlete, and hopefully get the Boy to some sort of happy ending."
76561198091576930,Recommended,560000,29231821,Posted: 13 January,all,Cinderella's Bad Day,"Keep in mind, this is a review written immediately after playing the game ONCE, and my opinions may change after experiencing different choice sets.  I will update this later.OVERALL: I liked this game and would recommend it to people who enjoy visual novels with self-awareness and humor.  There needs to be more visual novels that're worth playing and replaying, and this is one of those from the looks of it.  The achievements imply some very different endings that are truly based on your decisions throughout the game, and it certainly looks like the ending I got was tailored to the choices I'd made throughout mine.  I'm certainly going to be playing it a few more times through.PROS: Entertaining writing, characters that fit the mood and theme of the story, and the surprises at the end of the game as things begin to wrap up.  I was also very pleased with certain characters especially, such as The Bro, and how the BDSM side of things was handled with The Beauty.CONS:There are definitely cringe-worthy moments throughout the game that I don't think were intended to be cringy, such as implying that everyone in Kentucky is racist (?) and some other, uh, delightful moments of speech like that (like how one person could only say something they did because they were white...yikes).  On the other hand, these are Canadians, and I've known a lot of Canadians who actually talk the way this game does, so it's realistic as far as the ridiculously PC-level discussion sometimes goes.  Sometimes it just sounds like the characters being themselves; sometimes it sounds...really awkward and takes the reader out of the scene.  To each their own, however - some of it is well-done, others not.  Overall, I like the writing, just not those parts.I'm probably just boring, but I wasn't really fond of how sex came across as cheap, easy and...just, the ease in which certain people agreed to sharing was distressing.  Still, that's a personal preference, not a real negative to the writing itself.  Some people will love the game that much more for it, and the game never hides what it's doing.  The honesty of the characters just enjoying themselves is refreshing; the easy acceptance of people clearly sexing each other up without discussing it with prior established relations, not so much."

Some truly agonizing choices meant the only reason I didn't immediately start a new playthrough was I'd already stayed up two hours later than I'd intended because I wanted to finish the game in the first place.

The conversation system is a good ballence of giving you time to think about your response and having a limited time to respond. It's a well written story with great charecters and great jokes. It's also one of the best representations of BDSM in media and even if that's not your thing you can skip the scenes. I can not recomend this game enough and I like to buy it ocasionally and give it out to people I like this game that much and just want to keep throwing money at the devs.
