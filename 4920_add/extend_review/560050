Dangerous, as well as some enemies, but has new stages and bosses to fight through. If you enjoyed QP Shooting! Dangerous, think of this as a snack size version, with a slightly more snack-sized prized.Also it's 100% Orange Juice DLC that happens to have a game attached to it, so there's that."

,Recommended,560050,28435581,"Posted: 17 December, 2016",all,Anonymous_Neko,"A fairly shorter game when compared QPD. If you're good enough, you can finish the game in less than 30 minutes (I did). But with it's relatively lower price point, it's hard to argue whether this is a must buy aside from the 100% Orange Juice character add-on.Recommended if you prefer a challenging shmup and like to enjoy the light but colourful visuals and artstyle (and don't have a lot of time in your hand).Stay away if you have a short temper or epilepsy."

The difficulty is about on par with QP Shooting - Dangerous!!, the game this is as spinoff of, but it starts off at the difficulty of that game's later stages. If you liked QP Shooting Dangerous, you'll like this.Also, you can transfer your save data from said game to unlock all of the formations you had unlocked, so you don't have to work to unlock them again.If you're interested in this one and haven't heard of the other one, I suggest checking that out first."

Kinda short though, so if you're not into bullet hells or just don't enjoy games like these, it's okay, move along."
,Not Recommended,560050,34336357,Posted: 18 August,all,dlupal,"Scramble is a charming cute 'em up about the world's stupidest woman and her quest to save Chirstmas. A pretty standard entry from OJ following (or is that before?) QP Dangerous. In fact, if you didn't play Dangerous I recommend you do so you can transfer your points over.By all standards a very basic bullethell and a little too short (only three stages) but what little is here is cute and fun and I have to say stage two just has some great atmosphere. Hard to recommend unless you really like the OJ games or want the extra character for 100% OJ.I don't ""recommend"" it, but take that as a ""maybe,"" Dangerous is the better game, but if you have a few bucks laying around it's nice for the holidays, otherwise pass. If you've played any other bullethell you've seen all Scramble has to offer."

You've got multiple shooting formations and you go into a session with 3.  Playing more gets more shooting styles.  It's very short, but well designed.  Great for killing an hour or two.Also comes with 100% OJ character if you've got that game (which you should have, that game rocks)."
,Recommended,560050,28641434,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,senna,"This basically is QP Shooting Dangerous with New Year theme and Aru the rabbit as a main character.This game is danmaku, e.g, bullet hell: there will be a lot of enemies flying toward you and shooting cover fire. You need to avoid incoming bullets and shoot down enemies. There will be some bosses, who usually have much bigger HP pool and shoot tougher patterns.Gameplay-wise, Orange Juice's danmakus are much simplier than regular danmaku. Bullets are somewhat bigger and usually easier to avoid. The distintictive feauture of Xmas Shooting (and QP shooting) are formations, which determine direction of your fire. You can choose 3 out of 27 formations and switch between them during the game.The game has some light-hearted comic plot, which is not in fact importaint.All in all, the game is bright, light-hearted and pretty easy, something you might want for a christmas."
,Recommended,560050,28778271,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,A.G.¥10,"This is an excellent addition to the QP Shooting catalog.It's a bit easier than Dangerous, and the QP mechanics are a little understated here, you don't really need to switch weapons as much. The game is shorter, of course, hence the term ""Scramble"" referring to a scramble or ""caravan"" mode, although this is longer than your average caravan by about 3 times. Having 1CCed the game on Easy mode I can say that this is more accessible to your average gamer than Dangerous and that's probably a good thing. I think the price is very fair for the content on offer but in a way I wish they had made it a free game that could serve as kind of a demo for QP:Dangerous and a promotion for Deciga's localizations in general. A free game like this would be great to suggest to friends, where normally I would suggest the excellent Jigoku Kisetsukan, but since Degica have such a strong presence on Steam it would be great to have their own ""flagship demo"".  This really has nothing to do with the pricing of the game, and you should totally buy it. For new players I would normally suggest to play QP Shooting: Dangerous first, but as I said, this one is easier and more accessible, and Dangerous is, more dangerous, so you can take your pick as to which you fell will be a better intro for your skill level. Of course both QP games on steam have brutal difficulty on the harder modes, so you won't be missing out in that regard either way. I picked this up kinda late for the holidays because I didn't even hear about it til the day after Xmas. If I'm lucky maybe I can get my normal 1CC by new year. Otherwise I'll pick it up again next winter, along with Gundeadligne Collection's fun Xmas bonus content, and then maybe Christmas Nights and H2HXMas Doom wad, which I didn't get around to this year."

The game itself isexactlythe same, just the player character is minimally resprited from a doge to a bunny (even the character's hair was redesigned shorter so they wouldn't have to resprite that part) while featuring some new music and slightly different boss fights.If you're a fan of schmups then go ahead and buy this when it's on discount."

,Not Recommended,560050,28551804,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,Ness1228,"I bought this game primarily for 2 reasons: The 100% Orange Juice DLC, and the fact that Aru is so cute I dropped my wallet on the ""add to cart"" button.I'll begin my review by comparing it directly to myrather critical review of QP Shooting - Dangerous. In short, many of the things I did not like in QP Shooting - Dangerous are still present in Xmas Shooting - Scramble (pun intended).In the options menu, there's an option to dim the background to make bullets stand out more, and the bullets in this game seemed to have better borders; overall the game felt slightly less fuzzy and blurry. However, the game fails to distinguish ""friendly colors"" from ""hostile colors"" in that there are many bullets that arethe exact same color, size and shape as your displayed hitboxas well as colors that like to blend in with the background and just turn the screen into a convoluted mess rather than a proper bullet hell curtain, something present in QP Shooting as well (again, pun intended). The worst offender is the final boss, having to dodge dark-yellow knives against a dark-yellow background. Another thing I'd like to note is that, also in the final level, the enemy shoots missiles at you; if you shoot them, they explode. This explosion does not damage you. If the missile detonates on its own (such as colliding with the edge of the screen), this explosionwilldamage you; these explosion animations are 100% identical. The amount of effort put into making the game graphical and animated actually deters from its intuitiveness as a bullet hell shooter unlikeevery other game of its genre.Another minor thing that kinda struck me was the lack of music during some conversations, especially towards the end. I'm not accustomed to reading in-game conversations in pure silence, as it feels jarring to me. Whether this is a bug or intentional, I do not know. I just found it noteworthy.In conclusion, I enjoyed this game a bit more than QP Shooting - Dangerous because it's shorter, and bunny Santa chasing after presents is more entertaining than a dog girl frothing at the mouth over pudding. Ultimately, I stil cannot recommend this game in comparison with other bullet hell shooters due to its egregiously poor color selection and screen clutter of distracting animations to divert your attention from what you're trying to avoid."

Xmas Shooting – Scramble!! is a short yet brutally difficult bullet hell game that desperately needs a price chop on the Steam store and more content added. Yes I know that doing both is hard for the dev, but as is the game isn't worth it.It’s a shame because my first few times playing the game were fun and challenging and really pushed me. I loved learning the level and understanding the levels. I loved learning the bosses attacks and figuring out how to counter them. But the game just ramps up to darned fast with not enough content to make it seem worth while. This feels like it was made as a quick cash grab.The game needs a few more levels and modes to make the grind worthwhile. I'm serious, this game has a horrible grind built in. Earning in game currency needs a huge buff. As is it’s painfully slow and punishing. It’s just not fun and makes me want to delete the game instead of trying again and again.Check out my full review below:http://nardio.net/2016/12/27/xmas-shooting-scramble-review/"

Despite being fairly short, the game has high replayability thanks to achievements and the wide variety of shot-types. There's also steam leaderboards if scoring is your thing. Definitely worth picking up for shmup fans considering the low price."
