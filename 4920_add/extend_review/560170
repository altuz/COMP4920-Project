76561198345676151,Recommended,560170,31516026,Posted: 2 May,all,Curtron,"Ah yes.I remember spending hours in front of my t.v. playing Shadows of the Empire on my Nintendo 64. Almost immediately after I traded in my N64 I always missed playing it. They brought it to Steam andn put it on sale and I HAD to pick it up. And am I glad I did!There are many people complaining that the graphics dont hold up after 20 years, but to me, they look as good or better than I remember them. It's been 20 years for crying out loud!The controls are a little sloshy, but after about 20 minutes you learn what to expect and can react accordingly. You can move with WASD and the mouse, and sometimes it seems like the two are working against each other. A and D strafe, W and S move forward and backward. Moving the mouse forward and backward also moves you forward and backward so sometimes, if you're turning or re-adjusting your mouse hand you might walk off a ledge or stop in your tracks if you were using W to move forward. It's a minor annoyance, and again, you kind of learn what to expect.Shadows of the Empire is short (I beat it after I bought it in about 4 hours), but there's enough replay value. Different levels of difficulty and challenge points to find and collect add a little bit of depth to the game.This is an update of the PC version with animated cinematics and actual voice dialogue, as opposed to the stills and text to read during the cinematics of the N64 version (if memory serves me right). It has the same soundtrack you remember from the N64 with plenty of songs you'll recognize from the original Star Wars trilogy.I'm playing it on Windows 7 with a Geforce GTX 750 Ti and after some finagling (5-10 minutes of clicking around) got it to run on my machine in 1920x1080 without any problems.If you're like me and wanted to reminisce your younger years by playing this game, do it. You wont be disappointed."

The first half of the game is pure excellence, a real stunning nostalgia bomb masterpiece.But once you hit the canyon levels and start chasing after the Fett Man then♥♥♥♥♥♥really hits the fan. Enemy damage ramps up like crazy, forcing you to snipe enemies from afar one at a time. Your footing feels very slippery and jumping is floaty, sabotaging your footing on the many narrow ramps over deadly pits. Bosses are a real piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥too, Homing rockets refuse to track them!Six dollars is well worth slaying one of my childhood demons. I spent countless hours, painstakingly exploring every level (this was before the internet was available to me). I felt countless memories flooding back to me, both satisfying and terrifying. But if you've never played this game before you should probably stay away. I love this early experiment in 3D gaming, despite its glaring numerous flaws."
,Recommended,560170,29882440,Posted: 12 February,all,Notloc,"Before I begin my review, let me state the following disclaimer:This game right here, is among my favourite games of all time.As such, there is probably an amount of bias within my review. HOWEVER, I assure you, this bias is NOT nostalgia based, I still regularly play this game on my N64 and I honestly feel that the gameplay holds up, even today.REVIEW:[GAMEPLAY]:Shadows of the Empire (SotE) is not the perfect game. Like most early attempts at 3D video games, it is deeply flawed in various ways. However, SotE understands that it is first and foremost a game. As such, SotE strives to deliver a wide variety of gameplay to the player.Within the game’s ten levels you will find yourself on foot, driving a snow speeder, riding a speeder bike, manning the turret of a starship, and even piloting a starship. You will face 6 unique bosses throughout the game, some of which are familiar faces. You will also be faced with 2 classic Star Wars scenarios that have been adapted excellently to video game format.(The first level is literally The Battle of Hoth and the final phase of the last level plays like a Death Star II run)Such a wide variety of gameplay would often be a weakness for a game, resulting in disjointed gameplay and underdeveloped mechanics, but in SotE's case, it is one of the game's strengths. Each mode of play has been sufficiently fleshed out to feel unique from the others, they all play well, and most importantly, they are all fun. The weakest mode of gameplay (in my opinion, its not bad, just the worst of the package), riding the speeder bike, is only used once. Meanwhile, the most developed and fleshed out gameplay, on foot, is used for majority of the game.(It is also worth noting that all of these modes can be played in both 1st and 3rd person)[DIFFICULTY]:Another strength of SotE is its difficulty options. Unlike many games, where raising the difficulty nerfs the player, buffs the enemies, and nothing else, SotE takes a similar, but different approach. For the easy through hard difficulties the player is not nerfed, however the enemies have their damage buffed as difficulty increases.Additionally, power-ups and pickups change through the difficulties. You will find many extra lives on easy and fewer on hard. What was a full heal on medium might be only 20hp on hard, and so forth. You will also occasionally notice some different enemy placements across the difficulties.The true strength of the difficulty option however, lies on the Jedi difficulty. On this difficulty, the game is not necessarily at its hardest. Instead, the game is rebalanced.The enemies receive a major damage buff, the player can take about 2-3 hits from a Stormtrooper before dying. However, the player also receives a major buff.The player's blaster damage is increased to kill storm troopers in about 1-2 hits. Further, the player’s accuracy receives a large buff, facilitating the ability to continuously move while fighting. This difficulty is comparable to Ranger mode from the Metro series, enemies die quickly, you die quickly.(Lower difficulties require the player to hold the aim button, stopping movement, but increasing accuracy)[TECHNICAL]:From a technical stand point this game isn't that great, but its not bad. The game supports modern hardware well as far as I can tell, I was able to simply run the game without issues.(Some have reported issues with the game running too quickly, the solution seems to be to ensure v-sync is enabled for 60fps)The support of high resolutions is also not perfect, as:The HUD does not scale (I recommend 1080p or less, in the interest of actually being able to see the HUD)Going above 1280x960 causes cinematics to render in the top-left corner of the screen without scaling (Minor issue imo)The PC controls are also not that good. I highly recommend a controller if possible, otherwise you may wish to play only using the keyboard.(The Steam controller has yielded excellent results for me, as has my PS4 controller)The main issue with the controls is that the mouse is hardcoded to be read as a joystick. Moving the mouse left and right turns the player as one would expect. However, moving the mouse forwards and backwards moves the player forwards and backwards.The other controls can be changed as you please thankfully, including mapping additional keys to movement.[BUGS]:I felt the need to edit this section in as there is an issue with the physics engine. It causes your character's velocity to lockup for a few moments when traveling DOWN slopes. For the most part it harmless, however, it presents a serious issues during the beginning of the Gall Spaceport level.I was quite intent on beating Gall Spaceport without dying, and as such, I had to go through the beginning section quite a few times. The most reliable method I found for dealing with this issue was to walk into walls at angle whenever the floor was sloped downwards. This allowed me to traverse the area and if the bug occured it would stop instantly as I was touching a wall.In the few areas where no wall was available I simply lined myself up so that if the bug did occur it would carry me to my destination.[CONCLUSION]:Overall Shadows of the Empire is an excellent Star Wars games. Its variety of gameplay and settings capture the feeling of an adventure in a galaxy far, far away.The story is present and interesting, but overall, the story only exists to facilitate the gameplay, which is a good thing.The graphics have aged, but are stylized enough to not look awful.The soundtrack is excellent.The controls aren’t good, but this is in large due to them being designed for the 1 joystick controller of the N64 and not properly adapted for the PC release.[Game: 9/10]Abstracting away the technical, the content of this game is fun and varied, providing a feel true to the crazy, varied universe of Star Wars. Coupling that with the variety of difficulty options, the hard but fair challenge of Jedi difficulty (Excluding the boss of level 9… regardless of the difficulty you play on that boss will destroy you. Again. And again. And again.), you are left with a game created by people who clearly not only love Star Wars, but video games as well.[Port: 7/10]The game just works as long as v-sync is enabled to 60fps.The controls are weird since they were designed for an N64 controller.Minor scaling issues in cutscenes at resolutions above 1280x960.[RECOMMENDATION]:If you have a controller and are willing to learn the game's odd controls, you will find a brilliant Star Wars games that is well worth the asking price."

76561198018089537,Recommended,560170,29851663,Posted: 11 February,all,ErMurazor,"My favorite Star wars game of all time. As much as I love Rogue Squadron and especially The Empire Strikes Back on Snes... This is the one that ties the Star Wars universe together best for me. Defend Hoth in a snow speeder, ride a chopped speeder bike while kicking other people off theirs like you were playing Road Rash on Sega, Hunt down IG-88 bounty hunter on some garbage dump planet, fight Boba Fett in his Slave 1 ship with a blaster pistol, pilot Dash Rendar's Outrider in epic space battles vs both the Empire and Xsizors forces and space station.. it's got all that.That said... THE CONTROLS FOR THIS GAME ARE ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS! The Y-axis is LOCKED unless your holding down a certain button and is only even usable while standing still. This means if you play with a mouse, any mouse movement that would normally transmit to Y-axis input, will instead only take away your X-axis input... so mouse only controls left to right movement, wasd controlling the direction of your movement and strafe... I cant begin to explain how frustrating this is to get used to, as using the arrow keys for aim is absolutely terrible.Dont forget about controller support!!!  I'll only say one thing here... there is apparently no strafe input available on my controller (Xbox One) and apparently no way to change the settings for there to be any... Need I say more?If you have never played this game and you want to play the best Star Wars game of all time.. Do yourself a favor and work out a way to play it on N64 instead of completely ruining the experience via this PC port....If your an old time Star Wars SOTE fan like me.. it's definitely worth your 5 bucks if you really just want to experience the game again and are willing to deal with absolutely terrible controls.. maybe even as an added personal challenge like me.Buyer's be warned.. Prepare yourselves for an extremely frustrating experience gauranteed."

It was part of a multimedia project which included a book, a game, a new soundtrack, comics, toys, and more.It came at a time when prequels were not in sight and there was not a great deal of Star Wars content being released in a mainstream form. The fantastic story was meant to bridge the gap between Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi and does so well. The story is fantastic, the music feels like Star Wars, and at the time it came out it featured novel gameplay mechanics and graphics.While the graphics are now quite dated, the core gameplay is solid, the story is still terrific, and there's some major substance here for any Star Wars fan to enjoy, or anyone interested in a retro star wars classic."
,Recommended,560170,31545491,Posted: 4 May,all,Peter the Keeper,Love it. This was my childhood addiction among some other games. I don't know why people can't get a hold of the controls. I beat it recently on my N64 again and I'm enjoying the heck out of it on the PC.
,Recommended,560170,31534248,Posted: 3 May,all,Spruc2049,"This game was one of the first i ever played, and has been one of my favourite games of all time. The atmosphere, the sounds, the gameplay; all of it is my jam. (heavily nostalgic too) and thats all well and good, great game. HOWEVER that was the N64 version. This PC version of the game, i imagine is not too different from the original PC release, if changed at all. I found that it can be messy. Mostly due to the controls. The Ord Mantell Junk Yard, and Gall Spaceport missions were made much more finicky for me because of just how spastic the controls were in those areas. Its hard to explain, but Dash just feels too light and the jump sort of moves in the direction of the camera instead of his position. I dunno, like I said, its finicky but still playable. The great game i've always loved is still here! The levels, the sounds, the awesome IG 88 battle. Lots of crates and boxes, oh! and the PC version has actual cutscenes which is pretty heckaz. So yeah Pick this game up, cause there is lots of Star Wars goodness."

The main menu however has been replaced by a software settings window, but the rest of the game is still intact, including the CG cutscenes.So what are my pros and cons of the game? I have quite a few in each category, actually.Pros: Enhanced resolution for newer hardware, PC gamepad controller support, stereo quality soundtrackCons: On foot movement may seem floaty, stiff auto aim, graphics haven't aged wellThe cons I listed may sound problematic, but can be overcome once you get the hang of the game. Overall if you haven't read the novel the game is based on, or haven't played it at all, I definitely recommend it, as it's an interesting tale from Star Wars lore that you won't want to miss."
,Recommended,560170,29889801,Posted: 12 February,all,[NtN] Inbred Dinner Wolf,"I should start off by saying that I have a ridiculous amount of nostalgia for this game; this is one of the first games I ever remember playing on my Nintendo 64 at the age of 5 (that's how dated this game is, lol). Despite my fond memories of this game I'll keep the review as unbiased as can be.So for those of you too young to remember a time when Dash Rendar was canon in the Star Wars Universe, Shadows of the Empire takes place during and immediately following the events of Empire Strikes Back, it's got a great book tied to it which explains some of the plot gaps between Empire and Return of the Jedi. It introduced Dash Rendar, a similar character to Han Solo (Dash was actually intended to take over the spot of Han from Harrison Ford since he wasn't sure if he was going to come back for Return, excuse my nerd knowledge). The story of the game isn't nearly as in-depth as the book was, but is still fun as Dash tries to help find Han Solo and stop Prince Xizor's plot to kill Luke Skywalker. The cutscenes look awfully dated and don't hold up well at all, unfortunately.Speaking of things that don't hold up well, the graphics really don't look too great, especially compared to what we have as of 2017, but let's be honest, you're not playing this game for the graphics.Gameplay is solid but sometimes frustrating. The occasional platforming level (talking to you Gall Spaceport) can be intensely annoying at times as you'll just slide off ledges to your death. Shooting Dash's blaster at enemies not at eye level takes a few seconds to adjust (the game automatically moves the blaster fire as you shoot) which can be annoying on higher difficulties too especially in boss battles like IG-88's on Ord Mantell. Using some of the extra ammo types can also be annoying, like the Seeker rounds (which you SHOULD be able to control, but sometimes it won't let me which is annoying again for certain battles). The levels are really varied and bring up some serious nostalgia as you fight in the Battle of Hoth, fly through asteroid fields blasting TIE fighters, use jetpacks to traverse massive canyons, riding swoop bikes, and more. Secrets are spread out and can be interesting to try and find on the platforming levels, especially since they give you extra lives at the end of stages. The various difficulties REALLY ramp up the challenge too (good luck on Jedi difficulty, trust me) so if you like a good challenge Shadows of the Empire is great for that.At $6 this game is easily worth picking up for a good Saturday afternoon nostalgia trip. While it's not the best game, or even the best Star Wars game, I still recommend you pick it up if you've never played it before as it was really meant to be a true part of the Star Wars universe and the story/gameplay reflects that. If you can get past some frustrating level design, really dated graphics/cutscenes, and can tinker with the controls a bit to your liking, you'll find a real gem of a Star Wars game here.EDIT: After beating the game on Jedi difficulty I can safely say that this is one of the more well tuned ports I've encountered. I had absolutely ZERO problems running it on Windows 10, unlike Star Wars Dark Forces: Jedi Knight (which I STILL can't get quite right after having owned it for such a long time at this point)."
,Recommended,560170,32653880,Posted: 22 June,all,Fénix | Weaver,"The nostalgia...Playing this game is just like riding a bike. In that you never forget how to do it and it turns out to be a clunkier experience than you remebered it.Obviously everything in this game is a product of its era, but all in all is very entertaining, and if like me, you only played the console version, the cinematics are a nice bonus."

,Recommended,560170,30546908,Posted: 16 March,all,Gunnerman Bill,"Sorely needed release considering the N64 version isn't even properly playable via emulation. The PC version features fully voiced and animated cutscenes rather than the texted slideshows of the N64 version. Works great with an Xbox controller once you apply a steam controller profile, feel free the grab the one I uploaded for this game.For those of you new to the title, this features retro shooting and platforming action with a Star Wars theme taking place during Empire Strikes Back. You'll fight IG-88, Boba Fett, and others. The controls have not aged well, and if you're new to the game you'll likely become a bit frustrated with the learning curve. Overall one of my favorite Star Wars games and EU stories. This was also adapted into a novel and comic series."

It was my first game to come with my N64 and I was the envy of my small town to be the first ( at least to my knowledge anyway) kid to have the N64. Alot of students came to my house and actually asked ""can I play some N64?"" I had to tape a sign on the door that said N64 days will be on the weekend.LOL!!  I would play this game to death.  played it for 3 hours today. Still love it. The Game is based on the novel that integrates between Empire Strike's Back and early Return Of The Jedi. Controls can be a bit of an issue from time to time. I've had some audio problems with the music. I've never played the pc version and man its looks really good with the cut scenes. You'd have to grow up with games like these to truely appreciate the game. For its price I'd say its not too Shabby. Works great on my laptop streams well to full screen 1080x720 maybe higher. I can tell you I recommend this game not only for nostalgia but the fact it is not a broken pc port."

,Recommended,560170,30348148,Posted: 5 March,all,Radiator,"When I played Shadows of the Empire (aside from a Dodge Viper Racing demo, it was the first game I ever played) on my parents' PC back in 1997/98, at the age of 4, I (with some help) nearly completed the game, but died near the end of the last level(the RotJ style bit in the Outrider), and for some reason never touched it again.  Being the technologically turbulent late 90's, when we soon after got a new PC, it wouldn't run.Fast-forward twenty years (bloody hell) and here we have it, Shadows of the Empire is finally on Steam! I can relive the sadly neglected escapades of Dash Rendar, rage at the irritating platforming at Gall Spaceport and suffer from AT-ST and IG88-related PTSD once more.BACKGROUNDShadows of the Empireis set between the Star Wars filmsThe Empire Strikes BackandReturn of the Jedi, and is based on a book from 1980 (or around then) which was written to introduce Dash Rendar, another smuggler like Han Solo, to replace Han in the last film after his originally intended departure from the series at the end of ESB.  As it happened, George Lucas realised that it was gonna be harder to sell Kenner action figures of Han Solo if he was dead, and the audience might not be so willing to warm to a whole new roguish character after being used to Han for two films, so the idea of Dash Rendar was shelved and Han Solo was of course revived inJedi.  Suffice it to say, the story of Dash Rendar is therefore not a particularly well known peice of the wider Star Wars universe.  The eponymous game roughly follows the plot of that expanded universe book; Dash Rendar is delivering goods to the Rebel Alliance on Hoth when he gets caught up in the Battle of Hoth, and drawn into the battle against the empire, thereafter attempting to unravel an Imperial conspiracy to kidnap Luke Skywalker.GRAFFIXOf course to say anything about the graphics would be totally meaningless sinceShadows of the Empireis 20 years old, except to point out that as one of the earlier experiments of 3D gaming SotE is a solid example of what was back then only a fledgeling technology in video gaming.GAMEPLAYAiming and movement can get a little irritating at times, especially in some of the more treacherous levels like Gall Spaceport and Ord Mantell (I haven't reached them yet, but I remember them being extremely annoying back in 1990-bloody-7) but none of this is why anyone would or should be buying Shadows of the Empire.  For me, it's a peice of Star Wars history (though sadly of course not canon since the Disney takeover), a peice of my own gaming history, as well as the history of video games as a whole.  It's a big nostalgia hit for those who played the original version, a wonderful little niche Star Wars game and story otherwise, and not too much else."

I loved it, and I quickly lost count of how many times I completed the game.20 years later, the game's age certainly shows. The graphics are bland even for 1997 standards. Aside from a couple of gems, the mission design is pretty basic. Most of all, the controls are terrible, especially if you're trying to play with a mouse and keyboard.Regardless of it's shortcomings, it still has a certain kind of charm to it. I would still recommend it to anyone who liked this game on the N64. If you never played the original I wouldn't recommend it as highly, unless you're just a die-hard Star Wars fan.I bought this game on sale with money I earned from selling in-game items from PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds on the Steam Market. $4.01 worth of money that I earned for playing a game for a few hours?

This game may have been released on PC a year after N64 but it was originally meant to be played with a gamepad. With that said keep in mind this is an OLD GAME and you may have to tweak some controller settings. (look into how to do it with big picture this helped me immensely) I would like to repeat THIS IS AN OLD GAME, some people seem to not be able to look past this. This game is not going to be good if you hold it up to todays standards it's bloody 20 years old FFS people!This game may not focus on one thing and some people may feel like that means they don't do anything well but that's not really the case, at least in my opinion. This game is supposed to be a sort of a story-linking-sequel-prequel to the movies. The point of this game was to give you the overall starwars experience. Want to take down a giant mechanical camel? We got a level for that. You want to run around (and admittedly not really get to aim yourself...) capping people, we got a level for that too. Want to shoot at tie fighters with a turret while your robot drives? Got a level for that too. How about a speed bike race where you will probably crash everytime you try and go top speed? Got that too! The replay ability in this game is not going to be just trying to beat it on a harder level it will be just going back and playing your favorite levels again. I personally never liked the shooting ones as a kid but I found them quite enjoyable this time and I will continue to bust out a quick speed bike run when I get a hankering.The point is this game is NOT going to be perfect. It is 20 years old and was made to fit on an N64 cartridge. Is it a fun bit of old school gaming with acutal unique cinematics (rare for an N64 game btw) and it's own story? (ok it obviously piggy backs off the movies quite a bit but still enough of it's own story to be worth playing) YES it is!Buy this game if: You used to play it and want a bit of nostalgia (although if you still own the N64 verion just go dig it out of your attic and play it in stead), You want to complete your virtual collection, You want more (now apparently not cannon but screw you disney) EU story, or if you just want some good old retro gaming action.Remember people this game is as old as half of you and will have its querks so just try a controller and make sure to play with its setting and you will have a good time!"

But then again, this is the PC port, they didn't have to trim the fat like they had to for the N64 port (don't know why they stopped at just PC and N64 for this, I could easily see this on the Playstation or Sega Saturn).What I wasn't expecting was controller support, and this makes me happy, cause I don't really have the best desk space for effective KB+M gameplay. The funny thing being, while I programmed my gamepad to a more convenient setup, and when I wanna turn the jetpack on or off, I love how I keep instinctively reaching for the ""X"" button on my controller instead of the one I had assigned it to, like if it were the left C button. Just goes to show how it feels like the original to me.To those complaining about the camera and the controls, I got something to say to you; wanna complain about the graphics next? Do try to remember this was made during a time when games were still just making the jump to 3D, and this came out the same year Super Mario 64 had, so no one really knew how to make 3rd person camera controls yet. Sure, the developers or those responsible for porting this could have fixed them up, but if you've grown up with the original game, you wouldn't have it any other way.Now, the complaints, and perhaps one of the biggest issues I have. I wouldn't exactly call this a very stable port. Some time after you start playing, the graphics begin acting up, and textures start to go missing, then soon enough, all the textures disappear. This can easily be fixed by restarting the game, and it doesn't take long to fire up, but if you're far into a level and your graphics start acting up, it's really annoying, because you can't seem to fix it without restarting the game and losing your progress. But then again, old PC games like this don't run at their peak on our new, 21st century systems anyway.Another problem I have is that Dash seems a bit floaty in this port. I don't know what it is, but on Ord Mantel's train section, I find myself slipping and sliding everywhere, and it's cost me a few lives. On Gal Spaceport, in the canyon segment in the beginning, I had to meticulously traverse those narrow ledges, otherwise, one sharp move backwards or forwards, you'll wind up sliding down a sloped surface, and towards a conviently placed ledge to your doom. It's like the gravity in the game doesn't pull you down fast enough to let you touch the ground and regain traction. A learning curve fixed by walking slowly along the ledges and timing your jumps, but jeez, I didn't have this problem on the N64. Expect to lose a few lives in the process.Overall, I'd still recommend this. Not the best port, but I find it a bit more reliable than playing it on an emulator that tends to crash regularly, and I find it more convenient than having to break out my old CRT TV and my N64 to fire it up and put it all away when I'm done."

The added cinematics are greatly appreciated as there were only slides initially for discussing the plot between levels. Controls are a bit wonky. My XBOX 360 Controller with using Win10 works for this game, and still provides relative function and ease as  a mouse and keyboard would. Either way the control suck, but alas so was the N64 controller at times. I am 2hrs in and the game plays well.

I originally had a paragraph long essay review on this game but instead here are some pros and cons.PROS:1. Interesting story and characters2. First couple missions are totally enjoyable ( missions 1-5ish and maybe 7)3. Super fun controls once you get used to them. (some dated controls but are easy to get a hold of)4. satisfying to shoot down stormtroopers/guards with a rain of lazers5. Original Trilogy Nostalgia feel6. You will get a kick out of it one way or another.7. $5.99 for a game like this is pretty awesome! Well worth it.8. Improved graphics in comparison to N64 version.CONS:1. Early game design issues from that era2. BEWARE GALL SPACEPORT (Frustration will occur)3.Some clunky controls with 'V' to look up and down and also slight movements of mouse will move character forward.4. Game loses that Original Starwars feel in the last few missions (like Xizors palace is just kinda weird, man.)5. BEWARE GALL SPACEPORT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm telling you! You will want to punch your computer!With all that said I still need to finish the last level which is really frustrating me, so I took a break to write this review.I really want to LOVE this game but it feels like I've spent a lot of frustrating hours trying to push through bosses or levels that seem impossible because of some game design flaw with hitboxes or aiming or just level design.But I do really like the first couple missions on here though so  I can see myself playing those again. This game really reminded me of the Jedi Knight games because of it's creative original trilogy feel. I love the new movies but it's still nice to be reminded of the time where the originals were around for about 25 years and the prequels were just being made. To end this review on a high note: It's a fun Star Wars expanded universe game thats only $5.99!!!!! Go get it if you grew up on it or if you like Star Wars in general."

76561197970739339,Recommended,560170,29944055,Posted: 15 February,all,Captain Chaos,"A classic Star Wars action title, Shadows of the Empire thrilled me in my youth with its electic mix of stage types, different specialist ammunitions and one of the most user-friendly jetpack mechanics in gaming. This game formed part of a sub-universe created within Star Wars that included comics, novels, and toys, and at the time, there had been no novels exploring the period between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi before. Telling the story of the mercenary, like-Han-Solo-but-cooler freighter captain Dash Rendar, his droid sidekick Leebo and their ship, the Outrider, Shadows weaves a critical piece of what is now known as the ""Legends"" Continutity, pitting him against the Imperials, the bounty hunters IG-88 and Boba Fett, and the powerful underworld syndicate known as Black Sun. Although since they saw fit to edit the Outrider (or at least a ship that looked like it) into the special edition of New Hope, who knows. Maybe Dash might make another appearance some day.That being said, Shadows isn't for everyone now. This version is still technically superior to the Nintendo 64 version with its sharper textures and pre-rendered, voiced cutscenes, and this Steam port runs splendidly and without the overly sped-up gameplay you'd encounter trying to play the CD version on post Y2K computers. However, the graphics are nonetheless quite dated, it has odd control schemes that don't quite suit a mouse-and-keyboard setup, and while you CAN run it at a modern monitor resolution, doing so causes the cutscenes to render improperly. It is also rather short. In my youth I would struggle with some of the puzzles in the later stages for hours on end, but my playthrough this time took about two hours. Nonetheless, I think It's a shining example of what they were able to do with the property and worth playing if you haven't before."

It looks like this was a failed attempt to create another beloved Star Wars character like Han Solo. This story however was original and is worth a play through. The controls and physics are a little off though. It's easy to fall off a cliff or ledge because how the walking animations were coded. Once you figure that out you can speed run through this. The most greatest aspect of this game is the jet pack you get on a few different levels. I am not including any spoilers but I will tell you if you beat the game on medium you will know the galaxies secrets. I would recommend this game on sale or at regular price.

I don't hardly ever do reviews on games because it's pretty easy to tell what's bad and what's good when new games come out because everybody puts in their two cents. So, for a classic, and for countless hours of my adolescent life flying through my brain at millions of miles per hour, just like the movement in this game, here goes nothing. I, too, like many other people here played this back in the day on my old N64. And holy balls I am amazed at how well this port was done. Everything I remember from the old game, including the merciless boss fights and infuriating movement and aiming mechanics, is back. In 60fps, nonetheless. The controls are a little odd at first, but I got used to them in at least the first half hour of play. The added mouse movement is a little concerning, but everything else works great. I may have my nostalgia glasses on, but I am thrilled that I finally get to play this gem from the Star Wars Universe again.TECH SUPPORT: From what I've seen so far, the only reason why some are having issues is because of their VSync settings turned off at the GPU level, causing the cinematics and game to run at superspeed. A possible solution, other than forcing VSync on in your graphics card options, would be to run this game in compatibility mode for Win98/95/ME. That should do the trick."

Back in the day, I played this game so much on my N64 I should've burned the cartridge out of use. So when I recently retook it and gave it a shot to reminisce good old days, I couldn't believe how I liked this garbage so much.- Controls and camera: The main points of why this game is terrible. Don't even try to use m&k unless you got a lot of patience or want carpal tunnel. If you move your mouse forward, your character moves forward and vice-versa. When on-foot missions, you can't look up or down unless you remain stationary and press a button. This will lead to a lot of situations where your character will ""stutter"" while moving, leading to many frustrating deaths, mostly due to falling.You also can't adjust sensitivity, which is a real pain altogether. If you're in a flying/driving fast-paced scenario... good luck. If you're on a shoot-on-rails mission and you gotta aim fast, accurately and look around quickly... good luck.Did I mention already the camera doesn't move upwards or downwards? You got to press a button to manually change the view. And all of these views suck massive♥♥♥♥♥♥- This game tries to be too many things at once and delivers each stage poorly. It's a third/first person shooter where you don't really aim because the game auto-locks enemies for you and the footing is terribly designed, so the game is all about spamming the ""shoot"" button as fast as your finger can handle it. A flying sim with terrible controls. A on-rails shooter with no tweakable sensitivity settings.- SW: SotE is around 4-6 hours in length with no replay-value whatsoever. The ""hidden stuff"" is just some hidden symbols that give you more lives for subsequent missions.Just ignore all the praise this game has; they only come from people who are judging this game based on their own nostalgia. Even if you absolutely need your Star Wars game fix, this game will be a sore disappointment."

Shadows of the Empire was my first Star Wars game, and I have figurate mountains of good will for the memories I have of beating this game with my brother.  It was everything we wanted: it was hard, it was fun, and it was about Star Wars!So, how does the nostalgia weigh against the reality of an older game ported to PC?Suprisingly, pretty good.This is still a fun game.  This is one of the earliest games I know of that made the Battle of Hoth FUN, and let you run the full Star Wars experience (minus lightsabers).  Tripping AT-ATs, blasing Probe Droids, running through the ice base, everything is exactly what I remember.  It even has a puzzle boss in the final AT-ST that teaches you the ""look"" mechanic.  Level design-wise, this is very nearly a perfect game, from the junkyard to the palalce, the sewer to the Moons of Gall.What a pity that the controls don't come within a Ysalamiri's range of the rest of this game.  Even in the original Nintendo 64 release, this game was plagued by awkward and annoying camera angles and unintuitive jumping mechanics.These were multipied by 10 for the port.  Terrible startup menus, warnings that anything over 1280x720 will cause cutscene problems, complete unrecognition of the SHOULDER BUTTONS on a Xbox 360 Controller...

It was hard, unforgiving, had several glitches, but it was full of the real SW felling and nostalgia, and carved out a niche of its own by putting the hero Dash Rendar in the main role, pitting him against such legends as Boba Fett and IG-88. This version features one thing not available on the N64 catridges; cinematic clips before and after missions.Dont expect fantastic visuals here by todays standards, it´s low polygon models and surroundings,  but it´s an amazing nostalgy trip for those who played it at the time, and well worth getting as a historical document of one of the best 3D games at that time, with a great, but sometimes a bit confusing storyline.

Sliding around with early 5th-gen single joystick tank controls, you control Not-Han Solo, Dash Rendar, through 10 levels of miserable auto-aiming (except during the extremely disappointing flight sequences) on a mission to escape death at the hands of frequent bugs & broken physics. Of course, calling this auto-aim is generous; even the original DOOM's auto-aim pales in comparison to the ""aim in their general direction to snipe your enemies"" you'll encounter in this game. Most alt ammos are useless because they either don't ahere to the default blaster's auto-aim or are too close range to be used outside of a specific boss. Don't even bother trying to use the Not-BFG since you'll end up killing yourself half the time from self damage. The only two levels I didn't hate were the Hoth mission and surprisingly the obligatory sewer level. I thought the sewer map had surprisingly good level design which reminded me of a Quake map but otherwise most levels are either boring or too frustrating to enjoy because of the aformentioned issues.I wholeheartedly admit I bought this just for the nostalgia rush of getting to play the initial Hoth map again. While it was a much more miserable experience that I remembered as a child, there is still a glimmer of that diamond of fun in this abandoned coal mine of a game. I would only recommend purchasing this if you enjoyed it on the N64 as a youngling and want to experience a working version of it again on Windows."

For a great number of people, this game simply won't load, or loads with ridiculous glitches that ruin the experience. I myself can't even get it to start, which I didn't have a problem with regarding another Star Wars N64 port recently put out, Rogue Squadron. This game, however? Not even once. I'm getting my refund as soon as I hit 'post review'."

I like the new 3D cut scenes but I wouldn't mind an option to see the old 2D scene too. Screen sizing is odd and the mouse seems to drift upwards when I pause but all else reminds me of the original. 5.99 is a steal considering this game must have hit the shelves in 1997-8 and had a price tag of 50.

Some of the music and even the sound effects were not the same from the original. They added audio when there was speech dialogue in spots where there wasnt in the first which threw me off the most. If you really wanna play this game, just try and find it for N64"
