,Not Recommended,560250,35008910,Posted: 16 September,all,yurifan55,"Let me start by saying I'm no prude. I love Yuri/Ecchi and want to proliferate these genres across the universe. I can enjoy a well-told story with a bit less ""plot"", like Kindred Spirits on the Roof and I can enjoy the tons-of-plot-no-substance variety, like some of the entries in Winged Cloud's Sakura series. Unfortunately, Galaxy Girls didn't scratch either itch and my disappointment is further aggravated by the embarassingly forward attempts by Dharker to sell the DLC.I'd rather not write a huge novel about why I'm disappointed in the game, but the condensed version would be as follows:Positives:-No glaring typos/grammatical errors-Nice, clean artCould be improved:-Dialogue is long and uninteresting.-Not enough ecchi content to make up for the seemingly endless, stilted dialogue.-Ecchi/H content (including uncensored stuff) not particularly interesting. There were a couple nice CGs I found, but the scenes are all very short and have no impact because the story and characters are unnatural.-A large, mostly-opaque bar that spans the width of the screen where the text appears. Size and transparancy cannot be edited. A very poor design choice for this type of VN especially.-Characters I don't care about at all. This is partly thanks to the premise, which is shaky to begin with, with the game opening as the MC takes in two random girls who don't even know why they're there. One of them, bizarrely, is immediately open to the idea, while the other has an absolutely atrocious (though understandable, which is the core issue here) reaction.-DLC everywhere. I was turned off the moment I got to the start screen and saw 3 big buttons in the bottom left with little features I'm blocked off from because ""Buy the DLC."" When you press ""Start"", instead of starting the game, it also takes you to a screen where half of it is filled with greyed out boxes with future content, saying buy the DLC. The DLC content appears to be ""H"" stuff, probably with shorter, more tightly written stories and more of the good stuff, which is how the main game should play as well. It seems clear the long dialogue and initially uninteresting Ecchi situations are in-place to keep the player going beyond 2 hours, which is quite insulting. In fact, the main game without DLC can ONLY be bought on Steam, which further strengthens my fears in this regard.In short: The writing is too poor for this to be an entertaining story, and the H scenes are too short, uninteresting, and infrequent for this to be entertaining smut. It's a shame, considering I enjoyed Negligee (Dharker's previous Yuri title) and left a positive review on it. In case the devs read this, just know I am disappointed in Dharker for the cash-grabbiness of this title, considering they've been given a good amount of support recently and I praised their other Yuri title as well.This ended up being almost half of a novel anyway, didn't it..."

Also the price is kinda high, should be around 10 USD (in my opinion), as well as the DLC's price. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it for 13 USD on it's current state. Buying Battle Girls is a better option I believe."
,Not Recommended,560250,35195876,Posted: 24 September,all,Anor Wando,"There's a lot of things wrong with this game. As soon as you open the game you're prompted to buy DLC. As soon as you try to start the game you're again encouraged to buy DLC.The prologue lasts forever, and the story is pretty boring.I've liked almost all Dharker Studios games, but this is the first I've ever refunded."
76561198007353197,Not Recommended,560250,35016968,Posted: 17 September,all,MidnightSun,"HuniePop is a good game, this is not.The characters fail to engage with the player in a direct way. They do not query, approach or otherwise engage you. Instead, you end up feeling like you're watching things happen to you from the side. There's a lot of text that tells you what the characters are doing, instead of the game showing it through art and animation. You are told, not shown. This makes the game a detached experience.There's also a lack of tension, sexual or otherwise. HuniePop, for example, offers you a fantasy - you're an awkward guy who is coached and gets better with women. Galaxy Girls offers no such fantasy, conflict, or character developement. The ""sexy"" is expressed through pictures that look hot, rather than creating it in your head.There's something of interest in the story and the plot is generally fine, but a lack of destination as to where it's going, creates disinterest, rather than mystery. The fantasy of being with the engineer/medic is also a missed opportunity as that isn't much touched upon.It's not a bad game, but I can not recommend it."

,Recommended,560250,35057648,Posted: 18 September,all,The Dreamiest Wombat,"tl;dr:A nice ~4-10 hour yuri VN about a group of women finding themselves on a space craft far away from anyone they've ever known. Not perfectly written, but enjoyable. Basically an overhaul for Blossoms Bloom Brightest, though it retains a lot of the original dialogue.If you're a slave to the goddesses of yuri, buy it.Most important thing first: Two of the routes are—even with the uncensor patch—rather light on lewd content, the third on the other hand is quite steamy. So keep that in mind; mashing muffs is the strawberry on top, not the entire cake.If you have played Blossoms Bloom Brightest, this is a continuation of it. Or more precisely, it doesn't bring the story much further, but instead fleshes it out with more scenes and a new character. And bigger mammaries.Let's getthe negativesout early:The text field cannot be adjusted in height or transparenceSave slots are limited to a meager sixSome choices are not quite clear as to how they would affect a character's path and will require some trial and error at worst to get the desired endingsThe premise and backstory is nothing to write home about, really, and littered with plot holes if you think about it too hard. Some are explained, but sorry mate, I'm not buying thatOn the same note, the ""big reveal"" (that they're all genetically altered) could have been used a lot more. It felt like there was hardly any point to it at allThe artis splendid and clean all throughout. Dharker had some rather amateurish art and styles I didn't personally enjoy in the past, but this one hits the nail quite nicely. Complements the overall themes and atmosphere, no weird faces or impossible postures and quite an amount of detail, especially on the backgrounds.Same forthe music. Fitting futuristic-sounding tunes all throughout, blending in easily with the scenes. None struck me as particularly catchy or noteworthy, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing; they don't distract you from reading.The storyis no Shakespearean drama, although a drama it is. It focuses mainly on the characters and their rather solitary lives on a space ship. And of course, you, the protagonist, are gunning for either some sort of romance or face a bad end. Speaking ofthe characters, I found them rather refreshing. Without spoiling much, they're diverse, each with their own sets of more or less serious issues. The resulting interactions might be angsty and overdramatised at times, but I've never been put off by them and they get mostly resolved in a timely manner.The smutis fine. As I said, it is not the main focus, although a lot of scenes contain erotic undertones and flirting. It is a romance-heavy novel, after all. An additional erotic scene for each character is gated behind perfectly picking all the right choices. Someone in the guide section figured them out already, go check the bonus endings there if you have trouble.There will be beDLCsfurther down the line. An odd choice, for a visual novel, and one I cannot agree with, from a player's perspective. At this point, I cannot say anything about these, but they appear to be background stories for each character and one extra—possibly quite lewd—chapter.The pricingseems fair to me. 13 euro or your regional equivalent™ and the same again for the season pass. What you get for it is a decent short-medium length yuri visual novel with nice art—although it's mostly grey space ship interiors—fitting music and a crew that might have been better off with a psychiatrist instead of a doctor."
,Recommended,560250,35266264,Posted: 28 September,all,Grey_Duck,"I have not played the game since the September 21st update with ""easy mode,"" but I actually appreciated the difficulty of getting ""good endings.""  I played through probably a dozen times, each one ending in the first, disastrous possibility, before successfully making it over that hurdle and getting the chance to explore the some of the many other endings.  For me, that just made it all the more enjoyable when I finally succeeded.  I have enjoyed the challenge of figuring out how each character feels and reacts to my actions, and I was glad that, in many instances, there was no obvious ""best choice.""For example, early in the game, when talking to Kotoha, you're given the chance to ask her about her likes, her dislikes, or her previous life on Earth.  None of these three choices jumps out as an obvious ""pick me to advance relationship"" option, which makes it all the more interesting in my mind.From there, the different character routes still offer multiple outcomes, both positive and negative, I look forward to putting several more hours into this game and seeing what happens.I would also like to add that I find the chibi-style DLC placeholders to be fairly amusing, and I kind of hope they'll still be available somewhere to read through once the DLCs come out.  It's obvious to me that a lot of work has gone into this game, and I can recommend it for both the challenge and the excellent art style.My biggest ""complaint"" would likely be that there isn't *more* to the mystery of why these women are in space.  I found myself wishing there was even more background to dig up on each of the characters, and on the organization that sent them into space.  Maybe there will be in the DLC or in further playthroughs."

Not counting my idle time, it took around 5-6 hours of play to get every ending. I'm satisfied with what I bought even if it's a bit short. I did purchase the DLC too, so I'll hope to see more yuri and ero in those later additions.Kotoha>Emilia>SaraI liked Kotoha's route the most for her peppy character and went through it first. Sara's initial sass from the start cemented my initial impressions of her. I pretty much trudged through her route extremely reluctantly for completionist reasons. Emilia was in the middle since I had a route I liked and one I hated.I was a tad disappointed that this game didn't wow me enough to take over 1st place from Negligee for the games released by Dharker, but I got sweet erotic yuri so I can't really complain.Overall I would give the game a 7/10 right now."

You really have to get the walkthru guides to get a good response and if you want to get the bonus content. Other then that the art is nice and I'm looking forward to the extra DLC later this year.

I'm playing the adult version and I just get a black screen when the action gets hotter - some sort of bug I guess.  It's also an age before you get to make the first decision of the game.  Hopefully a patch will come out soon for the pictures, until then I'll have to use my imagination!"

,Recommended,560250,35012203,Posted: 16 September,all,Keyless,"After the release of patch 1.3, much of the content in Galaxy Girls revealed itself. I believed the game to be considerably too short before the patch. I spent hours trying to find routes to open up the rest of the game. Unfortunately, it looks like Dharker Studios inadvertantly made the endings too difficulty to reach (Fixed with patch 1.3).With that said, it still falls short. Just when the story feels like it's really opening up, the game begins to hover around you and your romantic interest and doesn't deviate from a rather bland back and forth between you and her for the rest of the campaign.The CG is well done, albiet I've seen Dharker Sudios do much better. I feel like D. Studios really hit a stride with their animated CG experiements but you don't see any of that here.As a VN game goes, this isn't bad. Right on par with Battle Girls. But D. Studios just can't seem to re-ignite the creativity they had with Army Gals."
