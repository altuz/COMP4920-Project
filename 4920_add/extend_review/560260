Also, if you re-use bosses it would be a good idea to change their mechanics in some notable way rather than removing a few platforms or making it attack a little more frequently. Still, I can't complain, it was free after all. It's decent if you want to kill a half hour on casual platforming"

76561198041195325,Recommended,560260,29861722,Posted: 11 February,all,TimelessHero790,"When speaking in terms of style, Super Blue Boy Planet is definitely a unique game, albeit mixed with some troubles cannot be overlooked. Thankfully, it is not that the premise is overly clichéd in that said hero tries to save WORLD from aliens and the like. Instead, the focus is set on the Hero going on an adventure to try and save from Aliens an INDIVIDUAL, whom in this case is his girlfriend. And so, it was only a tad bit clichéd, but unfortunately does not give a whole lot to its credit. Going on to the levels aspect, its The Twenty-One Levels are undoubtably where the majority its uniqueness lies, however, they just were not long enough. The ""Four Bosses"" were mediocre at best, being poorly constructed, both in color and motivation; substantial improvements, certainly and no doubt surely. The third and fourth fights are simply reenacting the first and second bosses, again and this was not a creative factor, whatsoever. A solution I present is keep the first two boss fights, different third boss and fourth boss, but if fourth must be kept, then maybe, ""Boss Ufo's Revenge"" would suffice, even something else entirely. Also, six hits per boss wasn't quite enough and not very fun; a minimum of eight hits would suffice and increase only up to four from there. For Example, first and second bosses would take eight hits, ten hits for the third boss and twelve hits for the fourth and final boss. These aspects to give them a greater sense of creative feeling. Also, one boss every five levels would be enough and NEVER out of order like 4, 3, 6, whatever it was I cannot remember, sorry lol. When speaking in terms of bosses speed, they were likewise not very fast for they should be to increase their speed the more and more as the player gets closer to defeating them. Finally, something about the title SBBP seems out of place and in dire need of some obvious originality. What's quite obviously shown in-game by the game's creator is that the adventure is still in the early stages of development - hopefully the Alpha Stages - which is understandable and completely necessary. My feeling is that SBBP should had been put up for download as a demo because of very early developmental stages. There is exists the potential and ability for the game to become a much better and smarter accomplishment than has been played so far, quite honestly. So, improvements, really vast improvements are a must. With these things being said, so far so good to the creator. Now go and do an excellent job!8.1/10"

However, this game is fantastic and exceeded those expectations. It has a simple objective, yet challenging. The music for the game is relaxing, puts you in a good mood, and is not annoying. There are only eight achievements, which is great because I like to complete games entirely. In my opinion, it takes on a Mario feel with it being 2D, which I love. For a free game, I highly recommend Super Blue Boy Planet to anyone."

,Not Recommended,560260,29999340,Posted: 17 February,all,null,"Although this game is free, I don't think its really worth the download.Its your basic platformer with simple graphics and jumping on enemies, there is nothing really that special or different that makes it stand even the slightest out from the others. Although the simple graphics are nice and smooth, the controls arent. Jump's have a annoying slight delay which causes alot of inconsistencies when getting over platforms, hopping upwards and so on.The music was annoying after the first few levels, its like (And if it is then ignore this) a royalty free upbeat track that you have the treat of listening to for ages.The glideing mechanic is pretty bad, you can get either two types of glides. Slow fall and Temporary flight i'll call them. If you glide during the middle of your jump you will gain height as you glide, I don't know if this is a glitch or not because I haven't really found any area's where its the thing you need to do. Glide anywhere else and you will slowly fall.Some elements are too precise for my tastes (There is a spike chamber in one of the levels where you have to glide in the exact spot the game wants you to inorder to make it across).There is a  gimmick on the later levels where you have certain ground you can fall through but it doesn't really add to the game and just makes things more trial and error like when trying to play at speed.Enemies are basic, one walks around, one jumps and another shoots. Their placement is not too great. Sometimes there are shooter enemies that cover your standing and jumping height which promises you instant death, and as for jumping enemies I find that when their placed in rows, due to there erratic heigh jump that starts up alot faster than yours you will end up dieing when multi-goomba stomping them (Despite them being laid out for that most of the time).The bosses are boring, the first boss just goes through the same 3 tunnels, the second is ultra slow and only moves once.And for once I can say the music fits for the boss as the boss music is underwhelming and boring. Its like a royalty free sand level track.Not alot of polishing, you can get crushed by the gates and remain alive. A few collision errors here and there (The top corners of the jump enemy don't really work most of the time and will count as a hit)In conclusion its a boring game that doesn't really bring anything new to the table or give anything cool and fun to play with."

For example, the main part of the game is jumping and then hovering to get through areas. However, you have to press the jump button twice to do those things things. It should just be a  jump and hold thing. Also, the hitboxes are so annoying. It is not just me complaining and me being a total loser. I was on top one of the spider enemies and it killed me. Another issue is the bosses and enemies. They are so easy to beat and are not very special or innovative. The spiders were just annoying because of the hitboxes, but the other enemies are easy. One thing I did like is how you can use the controller left thumbstick as sort of a mouse to select the levels. The last thing is the length of the game. It is very short right now and a very small download. I would try it out, but after you play it, that is it. I know it is probably one person making this game (props for the graphics and making an okay game), but they could fix these things and I would re-install."

,Not Recommended,560260,29710583,Posted: 4 February,all,Mildly,"From the start you can tell this game was created in a day, probably as some uninspired 12-year-olds homework assignment! Everythging from the name, the characters, and the music is uninspired and lacks effort. It even fails as a platformer as both Blue B*tch and the enemies movements are hard to predict. It's easier to simply sprint or hover past all the enemies than to deal with them, since the game doesn't even know whether what Blue B*tch hit was the top of an enemy or the side, and will tend to send you back to the last checkpoint if it isn't sure. Unfortunatly, you can't skip the boss fights. Every five levels or so you have to sit in a single room with a few platforms and wait for the slow meandering boss-thing to go to the right spot so you can jump on it however many times the 12-year-old thought was enough. I recall the second boss, which was as far into the game I cared to go, had a spaceship that went in random directions and seem to shoot at random times! It was god damn infuriating! Also, the game has no story. Not even a simple three word one like Mario. Overall the game is tedious, boring at best, and exists only to waste a few minutes of your finite time on the road to the grave."

,Recommended,560260,29695286,Posted: 4 February,all,George the Schizophrenic Duck,"Now, I'm going to review this rather critically, and it will certainly spoil some of the game's features, and possibly plot.This game is well done. I'm assuming it was designed by one guy using Game Maker Studio. I thoroughly enjoyed the game. The gameplay mechanics were okay. I really liked the physics used in the glide ability. The uniqueness behind each level kept my attention. The soundtrack was only really three tracks, but I'll assume the dev wasn't very good with composing pieces? Anyways, the game was colorful, fun, and well worth the 37 minutes I put into it.However, it isn't exactly perfect. Many issues and bugs were present, as well as recurring events that I found rather obnoxious.Sometimes enemies, specifically the jumping spider, jumped into spikes, making progression easier. Not that I'm complaining, but it just takes a bit away from the difficulty. I noticed some quirky texture work at some points, but this is most likely one person who made the game, so I won't criticize too harshly. I found the boss tracks rather unfitting, and for the first boss fight, the music only works because the boss is a snake. On the topic of snakes, the snake boss was ridiculously easy. Both times I faced it I defeated it with no issue. Whereas the other boss enemy, the UFO, is another story altogether. The UFO boss wasn't too difficult, it was more annoying and tedious. Several factors played into the UFO fights not being too enjoyable. Firstly, and arguably the most obnoxious, the damage hitbox on the UFO is a square. I have worked with Game Maker Studio before, it is not difficult to mask the hitbox to fit the object's sprite. I call that either forgetful editing, or lazy design. Another issue was the fact that the UFO's health bar regenerates every time you die. This makes the battle all the more tedious, especially in Level 21, when the boss has MORE health. And I did not get hit by the beams it shot unless I was trying to attack it, which bothers me that I have to time the jump, but I'll let that slide, seeing as it was obviously intended for a more intricate fight.All in all, I give this game a7/10It's not perfect, but it was definitely worth my time."

It's free, it downloads within a minute - even with bad internet, and the levels are all beat within 2-5 minutes.I suck at any kind of jump n run, but someone good at that type of games should be able to beat the entire thing in around 20 minutes, so it's clearly just a game to quickly play while you got some extra time on your hands.If you're bored, totally go for it!The following points might be worth mentioning if you need to consider if the game is worth the half GB memory space:+simple game mechanicssimilar to Super Mario Bros. actually the same as Super Mario Bros.I also sucked at that game.+ simple andcheerful soundtrack- listening to it only triggers youslightlyafter dying to the same trap 50 times+ dead monsters stay dead even after you respawned, so you can use the great hit n die strategy I used to beat the game+ monsters die to environment traps just as you do, one less thing to look out for-moving is controlled by arrows,not by WASD. Needed a break after the first 15 levels bcs of a cramp in the hand. Didn't want to play more than 5 levels in that session anyway, so that finally made me take a timeout- the environment also offers great invisible traps to kill you straight after you finally made it past the visible trap you've been stuck at for 10 minutes. yay. you won't make that mistake twice.unless you're me.- thebosses are far easier than the actuall levels- once you understood it's supposed to be a boss fight.The end bosses are actually more of a waiting game than a show of any kind of skill other than patience.Altogether I'd definitely recommend the game, since it's free and a fun way to kill some time.Also to challenge your calmness if you're as bad as me."

It took me about 20 minutes to finish.  The music and scenery are pleasing and there are several checkpoints per level, so you never really get mad when the game challenges you with a tricky jump.  Room for improvement by taking out the tutorial, maybe move the unstuck button from R to Spacebar.  The bosses are far too easy but most of the levels are fun."

,Recommended,560260,29591485,Posted: 30 January,all,stud: the boy,"Admittedly fun at times, but overall, not a very noteworthy game.For the most part, the controls are tight. Moving around and jumping on enemies feels very natural, like a Mario game. However, the hover mechanic feels very quirky. It seems to only work when it feels like it; sometimes you'll hover in mid air, sometimes you'll fly upward, and other times it won't do anything. This leads to unnecessary difficulty at times. I don't recall the exact level, but the broken hover mechanic made trying to traverse through a narrow tunnel of spikes very infuriating. Some gamepad support would be nice, but its absence isn't a deal-breaker.The difficulty is all over the place. I was able to complete the game and get all of the achievements in under 20 minutes. The boss fights are a complete cake walk (there's 4 boss battles, and only 2 are unique. I'm not saying I expect a huge variety of boss battles from an indie game, but the battles themselves are not very unique.) The actual levels have no pattern in difficulty, but in general, they're pretty easy. Some levels have some dickish designs (I go back to the tunnel of spikes mentioned earlier, where you fall through some fake blocks into a pit of spikes once you get through the tunnel), but they're not much more than a minor inconvenience.If you're looking for some mindless fun, give this game a try. It's simple, short, and fun to play if you're on a coffee break at work or something like that."

There were a few places where the checkpoints would be directly under attack from enemies. So, when you respawn you were instantly killed. I suggest making the little dude immortal for half a second or so upon respawn.A counter would be cool. Counting upwards, I mean. So you can play through your levels again, and try and get your time down. A counter on how many times you've died (per level, and while playing), would also have made this game slightly more interesting.Lastly, I noticed the little guy is missing a black pixel on his arm (when he's facing to the left of the screen, there's outline missing on his right hand).Sorry to be kind of nit-picky. Obviously, none of this intrudes on the functionality of the game, which runs very smoothly and without any glitches, I might add.Worth a play for the simple yet fun adventure."

,Recommended,560260,30042488,Posted: 19 February,all,CyborgJellyFish,"Made for an interesting 30 minutes, and it was enjoyable to the end. I will recommend this, but with a warning... This game is better suited to children or as a low-challenge platformer to kill time. There is nothing inherantly wrong with the game, but it uses a lot of the tropes that would define old school platformers...Reusing levels, simple enemies, and the biggest challenge being from human errorI have to admit, it was getting a little stale before it finished even in just 30 minutes. To be fair to the developer though, it is mostly because I have played videogames all my life - just because it uses stereotypes doesn't mean it is a bad game. The artwork was simplistic, though vibrant. I believe that was its intention, and it certainly gave the game a good feeling. The music was calming, with enough diversity to not be repetitive. The only real downside in the way of gameplay would be the lack of a sense of loss on player death, sinceyou don't appear to have a counter / life system and enemies stay dead when you respawn.On the other hand, it makes the game smoother overall with its current checkpoint system, so again it is a double-edged sword in my honest opinion.I would have happily paid for this. Not a huge sum, but for around £2 - £5 (GBP). Although it is not something I would play frequently, I can see me coming back to it on the odd rainy day some point in the future.Overall verdict - 7/10EDIT - I should also point out that while the game states it supports gamepads, I went through this using the arrow keys. There didn't seem to be any way to use WASD, and no options that I could find to redefine keys, which was a pain since I am on a laptop, but only one or two levels really felt limited by this. Since my controller is a bluetooth gamepad and not a typical xbox style (my regular xbox gamepad isn't working at the moment) I figure I have to mention that this game did NOT have any way for me to use my generic/cheap controller. That is, no xinput dll configuration file for apps like xbox360ce to work with - the game directory seems to be just the .exe file. So, if you are one of the few without an official controller, I would direct you to a keymapper software such as AutoHotKey."
