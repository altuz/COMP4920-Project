Spent many childhood hours cuffing noncombatants and then throwing CS gas on them for the lulz. Cuffing perps and then executing them with my pistol. Shooting homeless people with beanbags. You know the deal.So I got a hair up my♥♥♥♥♥and bought this, only to find out it's totally not compatible with Windows past Vista. None of the cutscene videos play, and crash the game when they're attempted. The intro video crashes the game on startup, fixable with the -nointro command, but even still, you're likely to trigger a crash by clicking the wrong thing in-game. Anyways, even if you get past that, it's frought with bugs due to incompatibility. I've been fighting horrid framerates, and now I cant even get the thing to get past flashing the home screen for half a second before crashing.Steam: Fix these old games before you sell them. It's 2017, the game is 16 years old. It's going to need a patch before it's good for public consumption."

,Recommended,560370,31234661,Posted: 19 April,all,𝖩𝗈𝗒,"Wow.. I've been waiting so many years to have this game on Steam that I'm simply lost for words. Well done to Sierra for finally laying that grudge to rest.Far superior to its sequel, the challenging AI is matched only in its impressiveness by your own fellow AI SWAT team whom you can nimbly control with numpad commands. The randomised nature of the hostage and enemy placement in missions (as well as whether they are armed/their predisposition to listen to your commands/emotional state) leads to every replay presenting a new challenge and with the ability to equip your element with a variety of different lethal/non-lethal guns and tools before the mission you will find yourself taking many different approaches.The graphics were dated even at release, however, much in the same way that the original Deus Ex can still be enjoyed by looking past its visuals this game is also worthy of that regard. It still holds up today and is especially entertaining in multiplayer.One point worthy of note is that there are issues with the game working on Windows 8/10 due to the way the game is rendered - you can circumvent this to an extent by using dgVoodoo2 which gives you a large increase in performance (enough for me to enjoy playing the game).FFO: Rainbow 6, Hidden & Dangerous, Operation Flashpoint, Door Kickers, Police Quest"

,Recommended,560370,31350955,Posted: 24 April,all,shane3x,"This game hasn't aged well in its mechanical execution. It provides tactical depth (which is a good base to continue working from) however it is not presented in a way that offers intuitive, clean and fluid gameplay experiences and mechanics compared to the sequel SWAT4.Recognise any nostalgic bias you may have when determining objective critical analysis of the game itself to modern standards. Asking for a game to be presented in a better way does not mean it will lose the tacitcal depth. No-one is asking for the game to be ""dumbed down"" or ""become a fast paced arcade shooter"".A few examples of how this game hasn't aged well include:I tell my team to stack up on a door to a room from within a hallway. I want to reposition myself on the side opposite side of the door from the team so I can quickly enter and assess the situation once we breach, however my team doesn't move out of the way so it takes longer than it needs to. In SWAT4 the A.I recognises I'm trying to get somewhere and will move to make room and then move back into position.The number keys are used to control your team and most interactions. This requires you to take your hands off either movement keys or the mouse to do almost anything. This doesn't make for dynamic and fluid gameplay. SWAT4 offers contextual quick keys and allows you to control your team without stopping you from either moving and/or aiming/shooting at the same time.When you lockpick a door it flings open immediately after. SWAT4 keeps the door closed after its picked open.When you lean left or right, you need to press a third seperate button to return your character to the default stance. In many other games either letting go of the button or pressing the same button again would return you to a normal stance.I purchased this game and gave it a positive review to show my support for the series in a hope that SWAT4 gets released on Steam and that maybe one day Activision releases a SWAT5 sequel."
,Recommended,560370,32027803,Posted: 28 May,all,Raptomex,SWAT 3 is one of the greatest tactical shooters. This can be run on modern systems and at higher resolutions if you download a few mods. How to get it running is covered in our video review. We've invested more hours in the GOG version which released several years ago.https://youtu.be/j9aPGYOOPJs

,Recommended,560370,33794580,Posted: 25 July,all,Jeremy Corbyn,"I came into this game not expecting much but i was genuinely blown away by this game. Considering I have a really bad laptop, with only 4.32 Ghz of proccesing power and 2gb of graphics, this was a fairly good game.How I came about buying this gameI found this game while searching for tactical shooters that weren't too demanding for my system to handle. Coming across this game, i decided to check it out. Doing some research, I found that this game featured no gun models (A thing i had disliked in many other tactical shooters as you can't see all of the screen) So i looked at the price tag. Not too bad eh?Why would I recommend this?Although in other reviews they complain about it not running properly on more modern systems, I have had no issues running it on my Lenovo laptop currently running Windows 10. Although it doesn't have many levels, each of them are vastly different environments and you can always try a different stratergy to a level as well.My Overall OpinionGenerally I think this game is good overall, of course just like every game it has its ups and downs. The AI is not STUPID AS A BAG OF POTATOES and the enemies are a real challenge.I WOULD RECOMMEND"

Worked great before the update?  I have loved this game since the day it was first launched on CD many years ago. I will sadly miss this game as I truly loved the game, the sewer mission took me 35 mins to learn and it is by far my favourite mission in the game.  To get this game to work properly though you MUST turn EVERYTHING to zero, graphics, etc.etc.. So, goodby great game I will miss you forever! ;("
,Recommended,560370,35093287,Posted: 20 September,all,IllrTrance,"With respect to its age, I believe that Swat 3 still holds up to the test of time as an amazing tactical shooter. While it's rather disappointing to not see Swat 4 on here, I believe that S3 is a great substitute. If you have money to spend and are reminiscent of old school era of fps's, then why look any further."

I won't spend much time reviewing gameplay, imagine Rainbow 6 with an emphansis on civilian crime rather than some crazy terrorist organization [though that does come into play eventually].I will however point out that this is no remaster. It doesn't work with any mods released for the CD or GOG version. You have to install fixes to get this game runnning right.For me, this is pretty normal when a classic game is dropped in steam all of a suddenly....I hold hopes that the mod community will fix this game. It would be nice seeing some content added for us veterans who have played this to death. Nothing is much of a surprise seeing as I went through it multiple times as a kid.If you buy the game and need help getting it to run, seek my or the forums help. I'm off to go handcuff some badguys."

Because of improving graphics and optimized controls, this game has become obsolete. I know that Swat 4 is still very playable, but unfortuatly Swat 3 is not as much. It's just hard for me personally to play a game that's Characters heads arn't smooth. The graphics are definatly worse than the pictures in the store, I would not be complaining if this game was around $5 because of it's age but $10 is a bit much. Don't waste your money on this game and just wait untill swat 4 comes to steam. -Over And Out-"

I tried multiple compatibility settings + suggestions online, nothing gets it running correctly.I also tried the GOG version which for some reason allows me to get in game, but from there the performance just seems to tank, which gets worse the longer I leave it running.I'd recommend the game over most modern brainless shooters, but I don't recommend buying this for a modern system."

Unfortunately, the game does not run properly on Windows 8 while even trying several fixes and compatability modes.When I did manage to get the game to work, it was incredibly laggy and crashed very often.
