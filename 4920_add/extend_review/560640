76561198025176103,Recommended,560640,29154914,Posted: 9 January,all,heyboova,"So the $4 price is what ultimately decided for me to recommend it.It has a great use of room scale. Definitely made me feel like I was there. I wish they include some hallways or something that connect the rooms to make you feel like you are moving throughout the house.  The outside looks great. It's too bad it's not part of the game. Inside I found the textures to be a bit muddy. The puzzles were okay. Some I found to be confusing and found it relies too heavily on simply finding a key in each room. The story is also not really needed since it doesn't go anywhere. The last room also killed the frame rate for me. It would also be cool to have some hands instead of controllers with a peg on it.I guess this all seems kind of nitpicky. In the end though, it was a fun experience for the price of a cup of coffee. I really look forward to seeing what the developers create in the future. Hopefully they are able to expand on the good ideas and create something more complete and polished."

I did encounter a bug that let me complete the second room, without actually completing it. But, I went back and played through again. If you have claustrophobia, it might not be your thing. I'm 6'7"" and I felt like I was practically in a phone booth, if anyone remembers what those are.The experience was quite consistent. There were a few nit-picky things I would have done differently, but I can't gripe or I will give away some of the secrets. I do recceomend  The Cabin. it is a well done example of what can be done simply with VR, and watching your firends try to get out will probably be almost as enjoyable as your effort to do the same."
,Recommended,560640,29246500,Posted: 14 January,all,virtualmarc,"A good small and short escape room (multiple small rooms), with only a time limit in the last room.The puzzles are a bit repetitive.It's mostly just find a key, which is not really hidden and easy to spot, open/activate something with it and one small puzzle combined with it.It even works with smaller rooms. The description says 2.1m x 1.8m. My room is 3m x 1.6m and it would probably also work with a with of only 1.5m. Before you start you are in a room that shows you the required size, so you can see if your room fits before playing.In the last room I've got some performance issues. When solving the first puzzleand the fire starts, including the smoke,the game starts to lag and I get bellow 90FPS, which makes it quite hardto get the crowbar and escape. My system has an Intel Core i7 4930k clocked around 4.3GHz, an overclocked nvidia GeForce GTX 1080, 64GB RAM and the game was running from an SSD, so no hardware problem.All in all the game is worth it's money."
,Recommended,560640,29639135,Posted: 1 February,all,Rocky,"+ Room scale games with no telporting are great because you do no have that worry about banging into things in your play area - which adds to the immersion massively.+ Looks great+ Price point is spot on for a short, but quality game (£3.99)+ The first VR game to make me duck cause I thought I was going to bang my head- Okay the puzzles are quite simple, this is not Myst, but they are not as simple as some make out. I had to use the help forum twice.- I wish this was an early access with more to come; a story, more puzzles,Summary - great job by the developers, I could lose myself in a game like this - isn't that what VR is about?"
,Recommended,560640,29186976,Posted: 11 January,all,Mindwarper,"The game is a little shorter than I would like, but for the cost, it’s not bad. The rooms are well laid out and provide a sense of realism. The puzzles are a little too straightforward for my own tastes, but they worked well and were consistent.I enjoyed the room scale, and had no issues navigating around my own space while within the room. Kudos for being able to create a good-sized space without blink or other locomotion.My only complaint is that on my mid-range VR rig (i7-4970k, R9 390X), it was losing frames consistently. The initial title screen outdoors was very painful. The game itself was playable, but the last room was almost frame for frame after the first few seconds of the event."

,Recommended,560640,30252618,Posted: 28 February,all,Handerre,"The puzzles in The Cabin are pretty basic, and revolves around finding the right pieces instead of thinking about complex solutions. I’d say the main focus here is the story telling, and it’s delivered mainly through inner dialog with great voice acting, but also with set pieces in the game.There’s no locomotion nor teleportation, instead you’ll use your real space to walk around the rooms. And the 4 rooms are designed in such a way that they feel varied and spacious, even though they’ll fit into small play areas (2.1m x 1.8m and upwards).I really love how the forest looks in this game, and it’s a pity that not more was done with it. Inside of the cabin itself the graphics looks ok. There’s some rough textures and sharp edges, but good enough to keep a high level of emersion.All in all this sums up to a great experience that I highly recommend to try out. Unfortunately it’s extremely short, and it took me less than 30 minutes to complete it. And even though the game is really cheap, I’m feeling almost like a hypocrite giving a recommendation for a paid game with such short duration. But dammit it was worth it!"

,Recommended,560640,29099960,Posted: 7 January,all,ZiXT,"Great atmosphere and the game's pacing went well.Puzzles were logical and seemed numerous enough for the playspace.Multiple rooms made for good progression when compared to some other, similar escape rooms.Room layout and progression made good use of roomscale.Gameplay is resonable for the asking price (25-30ish minutes)."
,Not Recommended,560640,29281691,Posted: 15 January,all,Mattyu,"The only thing I can give it credit for is the use of utilizing a full play space, but that's the only remotely positive thing to say. This game is a complete piece of garbage.The graphics are lackluster with awful lighting, there's missing textures, broken post processing and ghosting shaders. It doesn't help that there's only 15 mins of playtime tops and the puzzles are just lazy; How many times can you pick up the same key? Finding a billion keys in your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ enviroment isn't a puzzle.You can tell the developer is either inexperienced or just incredibly lazy. So many corners are obviously cut and feels like a game jam title, not a something you pay money for.Don't waste your money."

76561198310443041,Recommended,560640,29210899,Posted: 12 January,all,rawdilz,this is a fun game. i was playing on the rift and it worked fine except picking object up off the ground. but i spoke to dev about it and i think he will be correcting the issue soon. the game took about 30 mins to complete an as i understand there is multiple endings. i like that the game is shorter in lenght as it would be a great game to demo for friends. the price is right in line with the amount of content you get.  i give it a 8 out of 10 i hope to see more from thhis dev.

It was my first escape room in VR, and i had much fun with it. The playtime is ok. Graphics are good for a VR game. Sound and riddles are amazing.You can play it with some other people, that are around. Played a second time with two others. One of them were in VR and the rest watched, helped and solved the puzzels in front of the screen. Very cool. It would be perfect, if there would be a way to watch it in fullscreen for the others.  We pulled the window to maximum size. That wsa ok ;-)The price is a little to high. 3€ would be better."

While it has several rooms, theres really only 1-3 puzzles per room.Good atmosphere.Most of the puzzles are pretty simple, some are pretty good, sometimes there may be a bunch of searching for where a key is (usually hiding in plain sight somewhere).Took me 17 minutes to complete.At the low price point, it is worth it as a nice short puzzle room game."

If it was a free to play demo that would be fine but there are just too many things you could buy over this and get a LOT more of your monies worth.bottom line: If you just can't get enough room escape and have 5 bucks kicking around this will take up about 20 minutes of your time. However, if you are looking for something deep or something that will be worth more than 20 minutes look elsewhere.------------------Make up your own mind.DanielJMWaters."
,Recommended,560640,30990734,Posted: 6 April,all,brotherbobby,"Oculus Rift with 3 sensors -- bought it on sale for $3.PROSVery fun and realistic game for escaping several rooms in a cabin.  It felt like a real escape room.  I like how the devs implemented a true room-size room scale experience.CONSI had lots of framerate issues before an update.  After the update, it was better, but the image still stuttered if I moved too quickly.  Ruins the experience a bit, but the game is still worth playing.The game includes foul language.  At the time of this review, there was no ESRB rating.  I wouldn't have purchased this had I known.OVERALLI wish Steam had a neutral button for recommendations.  I recommend this game for gameplay and an immersive experience due to the room-size room scale implementation.  I do not recommend it due to the delayed graphics and foul language.  It's playable, but can be nauseating at times.  UPDATE: I purchased a new PC with a newer processor.  There is no lag in the video anymore.The developer has been very helpful and provided another game key for beta testing.  I recommend you try ""The Ruins"".  Interesting story, and new puzzles!"
,Recommended,560640,35143569,Posted: 22 September,all,FastLawyer,"I think this is is a good escape room puzzle game.  It has a nice atmosphere and nice graphics.  The only thing unrealistic is the small micro cabin out in the woods.  I don't think anybody would make a cabin so small, but it makes sense for VR to be full roomscale.The puzzles are pretty easy except for 2 of them which will make you think.  There's just enough story to keep you going forward and keeping you in suspense.  Even the voice-acting was pretty good considering the price. If you can find it on sale for half off, then definitely it's a must get for 20 minutes of entertainment.Rate 7/10 this is a good escape room VR experience to introduce friends or family to the concept, advanced escape artists will probably not enjoy as much"
,Recommended,560640,29216546,Posted: 12 January,all,EpicConspiracy,"Played with a rift and touch only 2 sensors it worked great! Atmosphere was good, graphics decent, puzzles arent so hard youll never figure it out.....Very much reccomend for $5, a good hour of fun. You would spend way more than that in a real escape room if you went to one and most likely wouldnt complete it!"
,Not Recommended,560640,29568554,Posted: 29 January,all,bking,"Unfortunately I can't give this game a positive review.There are NO PUZZLES in this game! Finding a key (in each level/room) is NOT a puzzle. You don't have to do any thinking at all. I'm not kidding you!It's a shame because the atmosphere is nice and the voice acting is great actually. It would be a great game if someone would have put some thought into this.So if you want a key finding game then this game is for you. Otherwise, not so much."

There weren't a lot of puzzles and it felt like most of them relied on finding a key in the room. The ambience was great! The production values were higher than a lot of other VR escape rooms.It took me about 25 minutes to get through. For some reason, it ran very poorly on my i7-7700k 1070. At the very end I had to take off the headset and see what was happening on the computer screen because there were too many missed frames. For a game that has no artificial locomotion, it did make me sick."

76561197993967506,Not Recommended,560640,31280888,Posted: 21 April,all,Laheupmo,"Unfortunately, I can't give the game a positive recommendation. The use of roomscale was mostly nice, but it caused some annoyances, particularly in the third room, which was a pain to navigate through. Of the five rooms in the Cabin, only two of them had much in the way of real puzzles (the others were mostly scavenger hunts, one of which was only challenging because the lighting wasn't great and as a result it wasn't clear what items can be interacted with and which cannot). I did like that the game had more of a plot than some other escape rooms I've played, and the voice acting was a welcome addition. But the story never really amounts to much, so story alone isn't enough to recommend the game.Additionally, something felt ""off"" with the visual representation of the hand controllers in the game. My hands looked like they were a few inches away from where they actually were, if that makes any sense. It didn't really affect my ability to grab anything in the game, so I don't think it was a tracking problem, but it did hurt immersion some.The game wasn't too long--I got the ""good"" ending on my first play through in about a half an hour--but I wouldn't have minded if the experience had been more engaging. For the same price point, I would recommend VR: Vacate the Room instead."

Thats how you end your game? Seriously?- the actual puzzles are a jokeThis is nothing more than a college students attempt on a VR game. Its a freaking demo! A demo you pay for.
