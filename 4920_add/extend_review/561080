,Recommended,561080,29448462,Posted: 23 January,all,byteframe,"Near perfect, and free! Blessings and fortune upon you. Roomscale games like this are the reason why I bought the Vive (apparently) and I could play a thousand more titles like this. You didn't make the puzzle(s) hard at all, which is good for a moron like myself. It's not very long, so make sure to savour the first playthrough, but even at it's current length, I could see myself paying up to $2.99 for this.If you take 7000mg of LSD-25, you will murder your father.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=848484506"

,Recommended,561080,30226773,Posted: 27 February,all,probitaille,"Very short experience (15 minutes) but very nice story and a lot of details. There is a possibility for another chapter.Virtual room are very small and because of that, not very realistic but I know they choose this to make the game available for people with ""standing only"" mode.Very good for a free demo. Try it!"
76561198045762947,Recommended,561080,30244873,Posted: 28 February,all,SAVjosh42,"For a free game, it's a must have. I can't wait till a full blown experience like this comes out. It was amazing, albeit brief.  The best storytelling I've experienced yet on the Vive."
76561198104663883,Recommended,561080,29667134,Posted: 3 February,all,JimM10,Very good story and deeply thought provoking. I wish it gave you the option of making your own decisions but then you wouldn't get the great ending. At the end I felt like this is the start of a great future for this game. I want to be this person and continue with more of an open game and more game playing mechanics.
,Recommended,561080,29926167,Posted: 14 February,all,𝔠𝔥𝔯𝔬𝔪𝔢/Chrome,"This was an interesting game at best.  The game was incredibly short, then again it was a free game.  The game has lots of potential, however throughout the game I felt kind of forced to follow along.  I would include an example, however I do not wish to spoil the game for future users.Overall I'd rate 2/5 stars for the SOLE REASON that there is no freedom in the game."
76561198092678368,Recommended,561080,29431712,Posted: 22 January,all,ptdean82,"Well put together, but clearly not finished. Graphics are clean, well chosen for what it is. Plot is well written. One quibble - it makes no sense that the CIA handler has a stereotypical Hydra-Nazi-all-purpose-German-sounding-badguy accent. The whole point is that this is super-patriotic American intelligence gone awry, right? Try a nice deep southern accent...like Kevin Spacey in House of Cards. Or a flat, CNN-anchor voice."
,Recommended,561080,30242575,Posted: 28 February,all,jMn,I can't wait until Construct Studio releases their next title. The surroundings and the atmosphere in this short game is just mind blowing. I loved it!
,Recommended,561080,29725947,Posted: 5 February,all,Davidcruger,"amazing story, i didnt expect it, wishg there were more vr games like this. construct stuidos, man nice job"
,Recommended,561080,29614281,Posted: 31 January,all,FireWaran,There would be a full game i would probaply recommend it.This little demonstration was interessting for room scale. I enjoyed the short experience.I hope there is more where this comes from ;)
,Not Recommended,561080,29887369,Posted: 12 February,all,Drew Peacock,"Ok. It was free. It lasted less than 15 minutes. What was there was 'ok'. I'm not brilliant at solving riddles. But I didn't struggle with the game at any point. I only struggled at the end to realise that, I had reached the end."
,Recommended,561080,30092041,Posted: 21 February,all,MDuh,"This is a 20 minutes story packed game with multiple layers to uncover. The story is simple but the way it is told is perfect. The only criticism I have is I didn't like the rotating bookshelf, especially going out. I was so confused on my orientation because after you rotate out, it's almost pitch black anywhere.Anyways, try the game, its free and it's worth your time to experience it"
,Recommended,561080,30092073,Posted: 21 February,all,weters,"This is a great short experience. The actual interaction of objects is a little subpar compared to other games (the angle of your hands aren't quite right), but on a whole this was a very fun, but short experience. I literally had chills from excitement upon finishing it."
,Recommended,561080,29570710,Posted: 29 January,all,Hirethor,"This was great, the closest I've felt to being in something like a movie."
,Recommended,561080,29558770,Posted: 28 January,all,מטסﬣ,Pretty good free game with interesting storyline.
76561197963322786,Recommended,561080,29575971,Posted: 29 January,all,byron,Well done.  I suggest they hide the other rooms in the final version when you stick your head through the wall.
,Recommended,561080,29451793,Posted: 23 January,all,Razzac_alpha,very short but well made. hope to see more soon
76561197972337172,Recommended,561080,29580194,Posted: 29 January,all,o_O,"The price of ""free"" is that there isn't much content. Still worth checking out though."
,Recommended,561080,29615456,Posted: 31 January,all,[AoS]Bullett,Highly recommended piece of interactive storytelling.
76561198347966442,Recommended,561080,29511680,Posted: 26 January,all,aharshvive,"This was a great free game. Some good puzzles, good story, good ending. Definitely surprisingly quality coming from a free game."
76561198004846089,Recommended,561080,29526197,Posted: 27 January,all,intranuclear,"Of all the VR games I have played so far, this was the most immersive, as I even forgot for a moment that there was no table and ""dropped"" my controller on the floor as I needed to do something outside the game. Then for several minutes, I felt very strange holding on objects. I am very surprised since I have played quite a few VR games and experiences and have not ""lost"" my sense of the real world. I don't know if I should be happy or concerned :)The puzzles were just right, not too hard and quite logical, so hopfeully the game desgners will not decide that they need to make puzzles so hard that only through collaborative cheating one can solve them (as most games with puzzles seem to do - I am getting way too old for those games).Certainly looking forward to the release of this game.Thanks."
,Recommended,561080,29532616,Posted: 27 January,all,Martini Weenie,Roger Ebert once said that video games will never have the same narrative and storytelling force that movies have. I wish he was alive to see this.
,Recommended,561080,30180220,Posted: 25 February,all,coalfield,Fantastic gaming experience I cannot wait for more.  Very short but so much potential as this is expanded!
,Recommended,561080,30203889,Posted: 26 February,all,R00ST3RDUDE,"I really enjoyed this VR storytelling experience. Can't say too much as to not give away any part of the story, but definitely give this a try. You won't be disappointed!"
76561197961439297,Recommended,561080,29857614,Posted: 11 February,all,R0g3r M00r3,"let's hope you guys expand to a paid project with storyline, missions etc etc, could be good. 12 minutes, for free... considering I bought ""Blue effect VR"" and got 9 minutes before refunding I would say this is a win."
76561198020353001,Recommended,561080,29889019,Posted: 12 February,all,Psychotron,"Great story and nice graphics, very well done! This is what immersive VR feels like. I really felt like I was in the story. Looking forward to paying for more content when it gets released. I could lose hours in this world."
,Recommended,561080,29815843,Posted: 9 February,all,Mr.Epic,Very good and short. It  hits you right in the feels. :(
,Recommended,561080,29735425,Posted: 5 February,all,Parakarry,Really good. Try it.

,Recommended,561080,29581164,Posted: 30 January,all,SuckerFreeGames,"It’s free and does a great job of storytelling.  The twist was fantastic and when it ended I just wanted more.  It was nothing like I was expecting, but what I got was very satisfying."
76561197992540035,Recommended,561080,29940436,Posted: 15 February,all,Zed,"Great little free game that I'll assume is a introduction into VR by this developer.Imaginative, fun story line, great music and sounds, and a brilliant ending.I don't think this game is pretending to be a puzzle solver, it is a story rich VR demo, and I appreciated that.I'll be looking forward to following what this Dev can do in the future if they are as creative as this."
