,Recommended,561600,32059524,Posted: 30 May,all,FatHaggard,"Here are my first impressions as someone who has played nearly every single motocross title in gaming history...Milestone has fixed the resolution issue with a hotfixBug: ""Skipping sessions causes unintentional skips later on""Workaround: Use the ""Skip Time"" button instead of outright skippingVerdict: Best motocross game to date, but still not the realism I'm looking for. Clutch, manual transmission, good ground physics, good-enough air physics, track deformation is pretty great.Essentially a much-improved version of it's predecessors.ProsScrubbing works well, takes practiceDifficulty scales nicely, providing bonus payout for increased laps, heats, and AI difficultyAI COLLISION IS FIXED. You just kind of push AI out of the way. They can cause you to slide out if they get the inside line but you dont get insta knocked-off like in MXGP1&2No more stutter like in MXGP1&2Somewhat forgiving track boundariesKeybinding options other than RB being lockedFirst person is goodVery good bike customizationGood AI, nothing award-worthy thoughMud and rain feel pretty accurate and pose a fun challengeTrack deformation works well, looks good, and varies based on dirt type2 StrokesConsRace start is poorly designed; it has no HUD and doesn't let you shift into gear until the gate dropsEngine Sounds are still bad in my opinionBike setup doesnt seem to make any difference (excluding gear ratio which does)Only 6 characters allowed on the back of your jerseyMusic is super generic dubstep all the timeA lot of repeat tracks from the past, some good changes thoughCant Rebind RB because its locked to ""Rewind/Push to Talk""...neither of which I plan on using.FPS capped at 120No supercross tracks, big dissapointment personallyadded as DLC $5 for 1 trackStill no multiplayer freerideNot very good graphics (disabling AA and Motion Blur helps)I update this review regularly, feel free to leave a comment!"
76561198112713668,Recommended,561600,32188092,Posted: 4 June,all,motoedit99,"MXGP (1) was meh. MXGP 2 was a step in the right direction. MXGP 3 was a HUGE LEAP in the right direction. I've been playing motocross games all my life as well as racing motocross IRL all my life. This is by far the best (arcade) motocross game I have ever played. The realism and fun factor are the best I've ever seen in a game like this. In my opinion they mixed simulation and arcade perfectly. Not to mention it looks absolutley beautiful! The rider body movements flow and seem real. The AI choose multiple line choices and give you a run for you money at times. You can actually hook into the ruts that the riders make themselves on the track! (not just the premade little berms). You have more control over the whips and scrubs (When, how much and how long). It is simply the most immersive motocross game thus far. I give it a 9/10 because they obviously still need to work an a few small things like bike sounds and the physics could use some touching up. But over all I am so excited this game is what it is and it makes me even more excited to see what milestone has in store for their next game.Oh btw the way the 125's are an absolute blast and great perk of this game :)"

But many features are ""phoned in""PROS:-Looks good-Improved physics (now it actually feels good and matters to use the corner ruts)-AI are a bit smarter than previous versions (when on pro)-Bikes sound much better than previous games, now you can actually panic rev-2 Strokes!-Whips and scrubs feel much betterCONS:-many features / visuals are copied and pasted from mxgp2For example: the menus look exactly the same, Almost all bike wraps / liveries are the exact same, Even much of the gear is unchanged.- Lazy implemantation of certain features. For example sponsor vinyls are mirrored to the other side of the bike. Meaning all writing is backwards (not that big of a deal, but adds to the feeling of cutting corners in order to get the game out)- Lack of difficulty. I can land on an opponents head and neither of us will crash, tee-bone them in the corners, and generally contact anything without consequences. I don't want to fall off my bike every 2 seconds, but I would like the challenge and reward of actually setting up and executing smart passes. making every pass and win more of an accomplishment.-Multiplayer is still awful and a ghost town (invest in real servers please)IN CLOSING:I definitely enjoy this game. It looks good and plays pretty good too. As a former motocross racer I enjoy that there'sa decent MX game to play. And other  areas are very disappointing. recycling a lot of gear from the previous game to the new one just feels very lazy. And no workshop support??? I hope these all get changed with free future updates."

Milestone seems to be heading in the right direction with this.  Game could use some more official brands and newer products for customizing rider and bike also some different tracks to change up from the tedious GP style racing but overall this game is seriously fun."
,Recommended,561600,32099896,Posted: 31 May,all,aeffertz,"Okay, I played it for the first time tonight and just spent the past two hours playing it. I'll try to as unbiased as possible since I didn't have that high of expectations nor did I like the first two MXGP games. That being said, this game is super fun! I didn't like MXGP, MXGP2 I got a refund after the first couple of hours but this one is definitely a step in the right direction. I don't plan on getting a refund and so long as there are some players online, I'll play this game a lot.Pros:-Visually, the game is phenomenal. The best MX game we've seen yet. It works my CPU/GPU fans a bit but runs fine at 60 FPS. It really helps the immersion factor. Free roam camera and replays are cool!-Ground deformation and ground physics are on point for an arcade MX game. I prefer it heaps over Reflex. You can actually ride and form ruts, wet ground insists on throttle control and tacky/dry dirt will keep your front wheel off the ground if you're too lean happy. Can't just hold it wide open 100% around the track, you have to brake to make a lot of turns.-Riding options. I love that there are options for auto/manual transmission, front/rear brakes.-Collisions/AI. AI is super fun to race against and the game has a nice collision front to keep things fun but not completely one sided.-Customization. Some cool options for bike mods.Cons:-Air physics.  This is a massive flaw/con and my real only gripe. The canned whip controls isn't the only issue I have. Besides having a ""one size fits all"" whip animation, the fact you have to push the joysticks in opposite directions make no sense to me. But the biggest issue is the game controlling your bike in air for you and almost guiding you through the air to follow the track path. The game definitely has a path for you in air and it regretfully likes to float you along it. While you still can overjump/case things to a degree it assists/carries the bike waay to much which is really infuriating when you're trying to flow around the track using your own lines.-Rider movement. It'd be nice if the rider moved more independently from the bike when you leaned the rider stick rather than the entire bike/rider rotate or pivot as one.-First person camera. This may be a personal preference but it'd be nice if there was some options for this camera angle. As it sits, everything seems to move around way too much and makes it hard to use. It's very fun but it's like a bobble head attached to a boat on rough seas. I solely use First Person cam in other MX games so I'm used to it but this one could just use some refining in my opinion.-Rider Name/Number. I'd really like if they chose a font for the bike and jersey that didn't look like complete♥♥♥♥♥ It's an ugly, small, skinny font with no ""race"" styling at all. The amount of customizing you can do to your bike to make it yours is awesome, yet the bike will always look like a craigslist special because of the worst possible number plates. Not being able to chose whatever number you want is a little frustrating and not being able to put your last name on your jersey is just completely stupid. Why limit the rear of your jersey to a nickname that is under 6 letters? Many last names are over 6 letters. Simple fix really, but yet it still hasn't been implemented.-Bike sounds. They're okay but there's certainly room for improvement.Overall:Solid game for my MX game collection and my first MXGP game that I'll happily keep and play! As far as fun and play-ability go, I will rank this the same as Reflex. Visually heaps better, fun AI and ground physics. The only thing holding this game back from being the best Arcade MX game ever is the frustrating air physics."

This is really good but once you finish the career not much to do other than fang around in Time Attack or run 20 lappers in the rain.terrain deformation is great and hooking into ruts can be really satisfying but it seems like there is a limit to the degredation don't notice much difference from lap 10 to 20 for example...My biggest gripe is floating bikes, its really noticeable, add some roost to the rear wheel or something. I love how the game looks and it plays really well but those floating bikes, oh man.Looking forward to some DLC, this would be an awesome game to allow user content but I guess that wont happen, lets just pray for a good selection of DLC tracks.8/10 would reccomend to MX fans"

Makes it rediculously easy to buy parts and bikes IMO.. They should tone that down a bitBeing an actual rider/racer I do not enjoy garbage MX games (Moto Racer 4, MX V ATV SX, Ride, MX V ATV Alive).. I recommend this games because it is the closest replication of a real ride yet, with a touch of arcade style like MX vs ATV Reflex. Truthfully I dont like simulation games because they don't focus on the fun aspect, and tend to focus on the Excel spreadsheet boring dryness that tapers away in about 3 hours. I am enjoying this game and happy with the price/value."
,Recommended,561600,32184123,Posted: 4 June,all,The1whokill5,"First impressions, just wow this game really improves on MXGP 2. Still leaves more to be desired but i have to say this turned out really good. Would recommend for people who are into the genre.Pros:- This game looks beautiful- physics have improved greatly. My big con from the last game was bumping elbows with other riders and just crashing, now you can actually be agressive going into turns trying to pass somebody. Also adding the scrub feature makes it way better the fixed jump isnt so bad anymore considering you control the whole motion but you still have one animation for it.- Customizing is deeper than the last game, adding accent colors to the bike aswell, graphic kits however have not changed except for the addition of whole bike graphic kit for those who wanna keep sponsors instead of going on a team in career.- track deterates well and makes it challanging for longer motos somtimes, making the rider adapt to the track changes throughout the race.- two strokes, theyre kinda slow but still a cool addition- no more creating a milestone account for multiplayer.Cons:- Jumps have been downsized, some may not notice but i for one notice the big quad for Matterley basin has been cut out, and the huge triple at Glenn Helen is scaled down alot- whips are still un controllable to an extent. They have improved it to the point where you can pull it back and control how far you push it, but still only one animation.-no widescreen support at the moment the popular 3440x1440 and some other resolution options are not available at the current time- Current bugs can be quite annoying, but luckliey they have provided a work around and are trying to fix atm-Number font is kinda annoying and quite ugly quite franklyOverall: better game from MXGP 2, with the current riders and current tracks from last year. They're in the works on improving the game to make it better. If you liked the last MXGP game or just intrested in the genre i recommend this game to you."

,Recommended,561600,32077338,Posted: 30 May,all,Ramadan Steve,"So far i am loving this game, graphics and overall feel of the bikes have greatly improved from MXGP2.The bikes feel alot faster and more ""clean and crisp"" whips and scrubs are alot cleaner and the animation looks way better.Plenty of character and bike customization which is a +++ for me.AI dont all follow the same path as they did in MXGP2 they seem alot smarter with their riding.Overall awesome MX game best out there atm would give 9/10This is coming from a casual gamer not a professional video game critic like the people that post reviews think they are, if youre a casual gamer and liked/loved MXGP2 or ever MX VS ATV this is definetly worth the 55 schmeckles"
,Recommended,561600,32907254,Posted: 27 June,all,Blanco Niño,"If you are looking for a MotoX game that is more simulation than arcade, this is a good place to start. Is the game perfect? No. But for hardcore MotoX fans such as myself looking to get their fix, it'll do the job more than adequately. Customization is pretty good, all the major manufacturers are representer including 2-Strokes. The mechanics, physics, and graphics are much improved from MXGP2. Scrubs and whips in particular are a little more fluid and rewarding in MXGP3 as opposed to MXGP2. All in all, it's a fun game that hardcore and casual MotoX fans can enjoy.Only downside to the game for me at this time is the omission of Supercross. MXGP2 had Supercross, and cnsidering the Training Compound has a Supercross style track, this might be coming in future DLC."
,Recommended,561600,33567679,Posted: 15 July,all,ScAwN7,"I have been playing motocross games since the original Motocross Madness. Let me just say that MXGP3 is the most realistic feeling and looking game by far. The Unreal 4 engine really has allowed them to create the best playing motocross game to date. On the down side, it's the same MXGP tracks with some updates. Some are good and some are bad. The KTM bikes seem to be better than anything else in the game (not just stats, but actually handle and faster than the others). The first DLC was a massive disappointment as it was simply one track and updated Honda models that only play on this track. Milestone really needs to get back to work and include more content if possible. I think the problem is the MXGP name of the franchise. Milestone doesn't seem to want to go after more content and it's going to be hard to survive on these tracks alone."

76561197992661513,Recommended,561600,32093146,Posted: 31 May,all,macbethloserkid,"Having logged plenty of time in MXGP and MXGP 2, I was very excited for MXGP 3. I have to say so far it very good. The added weather is very nice, air movement is improved, sounds are better and the ruts actually seem to make a difference.Is there room for improvement? Of course (the gear is a big let down, but I get licensing can be difficult) It's probably the best motocross game I've played. I'll update after I have more time to play.Edit: I've had time to play and it is a great game. I enjoy the way the ruts develop throughout and the riders seem to take different lines. However, sometimes they are oblivious and run right into you. Unlike MXGP 2, this doesn't automatically knock you down and you can push back. I wish the ruts from Moto 1 would stay and continue to develop through Moto 2 instead of starting with a fresh track every moto.The addition of weather is a nice touch and their is a difference between a dry track and a wet one, notably your rear tire spins very easily on a wet track. Is it the best? No, but it's something.I only have two big complaints, one that is not the fault of the developer. The tracks do get boring quickly, but this is to be expected since I've played 1 and 2 so much and it is a licensed game. If Youthstream doesn't add tracks, there will not be any new tracks in MXGP 3 (aside from compound, Charlotte, etc). The second is I wish you could go back after choosing a new team/sponsor/custom team. I went to select a new sponsor since I wanted to race my two-stroke in career mode and completely blew my MX1 season because it was an MX2 sponsor with six races left and only a big enough points lead for three missed races. There is no way to go back so I'm stuck looking at a missed championship. So be extremely careful when looking at the team so you don't blow your championship too.Overall, nice addition of weather, ruts, better handling, increased in air movement and fun racing. Hopefully one day we get to see this developer do a series with the US Nationals."
76561198069816316,Recommended,561600,32077219,Posted: 30 May,all,thegameshow0,"This is going to be a long one...I am playing on all the hardest settings with a 10 lap full race weekend. However every time I finish race 1, race 2 goes to a different track. I retired from the race and look at the points, and i am way behind now, as if I only got 25 points in the first location and then 0 points in the second location. So i'm 65 points back now after one race. I restarted the game and tried again and it still happened. I tried three different times and they all did the same thing. Not jumping to the next track on the list, but a different random track. Also on a different note, my screen is an ultra-wide monitor recommended at 2560x1080 px, but that isn't an option. So i'm having to run the game in a windowed version which is weird because my desktop is being shown on the sides of the screen. The game is also very rushed in some places or looks as if the game developers just couldn't be bothered to go to the effort to try. For example the, when it is raining, the rain is just an animated layover on the screen rather than being apart of the world like in higher quality games like Fifa 17. Another example is the start. As someone who races motocross in real life, I know that a dirt bike shoots out the gate like a rocket but in the game, the bikes lag really bad off the gate as they struggle to gain traction. I know it is hard for games like this to be compared to games like fifa 17 but they could have tried a little harder. overlooking these few faults and assuming they will fix the major bugs in the coming days, this the game is amazing. A huge improvement on the already amazing mxgp 2. The riding has been slowed down forcing you to hook into ruts and to take more realistic lines. The AI is pretty easy to beat but still put up a very good fight. Even a rider that you are 5 seconds a lap faster than will take a half a lap or more to pass. The music is very basic and can get a little annoying. Money is also way too easy to get. After only half a race (Since I can't do a full one yet), I was able to buy the best brakes, suspension, tires, and exhaust pipe. I will probably have a fully upgraded KTM 250 in only 3 or 4 races, if that. Overall though, the game is amazing and can't wait to play it more once they fix the major bugs."
76561198141451349,Recommended,561600,32136317,Posted: 2 June,all,KG13,"I have mixed feelings about this game, but in the end I think it is a not a bad product. MXGP3 is fun and entertaining  but for 49,99EU I would expect that game will make me busy for longer and force to use some skills but unfortunately this is a simple arcade racing game with good visual package.As mentioned above, MXGP3 is not challanging in any aspect. Even at pro physics and hardest AI setting you can easily win every race after learning the track. Also the sounds are moderate but not as annoying as before. The game suffers from minor bugs that probably will be fixed soon but as we all know Milestone games are far from flawless and some annoying things didn't change through years (p2p multiplayer lobbies, instant respawns, no freeriding on the track, very simplified physics, simplified bike set up that do not change much in bike behaviour)As for the positives: Gameplay and the speed felling is nice (but thats is achieved by wide Field Of View which is not very realistic). Graphics, track deformations are beautiful and hypnotising. The tracks, wide range of possibilites to customise motorcycles and rider. And of course licenced bikes, parts and clothes.Buy if:-you are big MXGP fan-you look for simple racing game that will entertain you for some timeIf you hesitate:-wait for sale and the patches that will fix some bugs.Don't buy if:-you look for realistic physics and sounds in a motorcycle racing game-you are tired with games made by Milestone and the way they make games."

,Recommended,561600,32108937,Posted: 1 June,all,xCookieSlayer,=== LONG REVIEW === WORTH READING ===So you are looking down here trying to find out if this is worth your money. Well let me start of with saying its a great game with lots of potential and if you are willing to put up with a few bugs then this game can truly be amazing. The main bugs that I've come accross is the wheeles while riding spin very slowly no matter what your speed is (very noticable on half coloured rims. Another bug is that the no. on your jersey looks very glitchy when riding and can be very hard to read sometimes. Also small things like not properly pulling the clutch or a small texture gap between the right wrist.But all around the for a game that has now been out for 2 days I think its acceptable for it not to be 100% perfect.AI (very easy - hard) is practically the same.Things I love about the game is that customization is detailed and gives you a variety of options. Bikes with different manufactures have different engine noises which sounds nice not some poor quality audio. The graphics are nice although trees look like crap but the bikes and terrain are very nice. Menu's are easy to navigate through and you can easily change bikes and edit your rider at most pre race menus. Track lines change depending on how many riders go in a specific line and this is very usefull on later laps. Other objects that are movable stay in the possition they are left in and can end up on the track. ( AI likes to crash into them :D) The controls are acctually very easy to handle and scrubbing is very controllable and after practice can be very easy to preform. Turning can get sharp and can be abit stiff if you don't more your weight.BUT ALL AROUND LIKE I SAID AT THE START IF YOU ARE WILLING TO PUT UP WITH THE FEW BUGS AND GLITCHES HERE AND THERE THIS GAME IS TRUELLY AMAZING. I PREDICT THAT IN THE FUTURE THE CONTENT WILL BE MUCH BIGGER AND ALL THE CURRENT BUGS WILL BE FIXED.  ITS HONESTLY NOT A BAD EXPERIENCE RIGHT NOW AND I DEFINITELY ENJOY THE GAME AT ITS CURRENT STAGE.PS I wouldn't bother looking at reviews with under 2 hours as you don't really  get a chance to experience the full game.

I'll rate some of my most important categories on a scale of 1-10.Graphics: 9/10Terrain Deformation and its Effects on Physics: 8/10UI: 8/10Customization: 10/10Ground Based Physics: 9/10Air Based Physics (scrubs+whips): 6/10Career Mode: 8/10I think Milestone is headed in the right direction with this and I can't wait to see what is next.

Listen to your customers feedback and support the product a little more after release and you'll be leading the MX racing genre probably forever...

Multiplayer is really glitchy and the AI sucks. Even on the hardest difficulty the bots are way too slow and its way too easy to win. And no workshop? Come on...The customization is awesome and so are the graphics and the physics but the fact that multiplayer is so buggy just makes the game not worth it. If they fix the multiplayer issues and add a workshop i would recommend this game any day of the week!

Beautiful looking game (the graphics are amazing) and really enjoying it so far. The handling is superb in Pro mode but it's pretty tough to tame :)Moving to Unreal engine was the right choice.

The factory bikes have waaaay too small numbers. (except for the factory ktm bikes) We should be able to scale them up.4. We should be allowed to wear our own suit on factory bikes with the respective sponsors overlayed across our own gear.5. We should have access to the 2017 Hondas now that you have added them to the smx dlc

With that being said what kind of ridiculousness is its 2017 and i cant go above 1080p? I have a 1440p 100Hz ultra wide asus PG348Q and it looks like CRAP downscaled to 1080p. Come on people get with the program. I'll change my review once MXGP irons out its bugs but for now id steer clear you can only go up to 1080p.**EDIT** 5.31.17That didn't take long for milestone to add in the other resolution support. Since changing the graphics it all seems to run really nice and smooth! I still havent tried any online but so far its been a blast since the update! I'd recommend it now."

MXGP 3 is the most realistic Motocross Video Game I have ever played bringing dynamic tracks to amazing physics.  This game does not disappoint, this game has changed the face of Motocross video games.  MXGP 3 is a step in the right direction other than a few bugs this game is close to perfect, not quite there yet but shows a true riding experience for new and experienced players."

I have also played the first and second MGXP and they were decent, but got boring after alittle. I played MXGP 2 alot and coming from that to this really only the graphics is what is different, with a few other new features. But i got bored of mxgp 3 in less than 2 hours.Dont get me wrong, this game is good if you never played any mxgp games,  because i loved mxgp 2 but this really isnt that different. I came into this with low expectations and was hoping to be suprised by some things, but really wasnt. The graphics are the best out of any motocross game ever made, and the customization, i will admit that. The fun factor though goes away real quick, it just isnt a game you can have fun with for hundreds of hours like mx simulator or some old mx vs atv games.They need to focus more on realistic physics and not just realistic graphics. Some of the best motocross games ever have very simple graphics, but they are great because the physics are awesome and everything in the games are just balanced right. I really wanted to give this game a chance but for $50 it is so not worth it. Maybe if it came down to $25 then i feel like that would be a fair price, but this is by no means a $50 game."

,Not Recommended,561600,32091958,Posted: 31 May,all,IVIX1,"-Same Animations-Same feel when going off a jump a gear too high and pinned---Instead of overjumping like a real 450 you only go a certain distance then bike drops.-Same slide out crash physics that make no sense to a real dirtbike-Same ""weight outside peg to turn"" crashes bike and is nothing like real bikes-Same bad sounding bikes----How can you not have sound be right?...still-Same lack of logistics---Seemingly ok with just doing the bare minimum Milestone shows again that changes they claim are signifigant are realliy minute.-Same game, updated engine, very little changed.This doesnt feel like a dirtbike at all.  It feels like a 450  has the burst power of a Z50, and that is the biggest issue.  450 Motocross, and 250 Motocross bikes are powerful machines that are nimble because of rider skill and setup.  They aren't boats that handle oddly.  You scrub because of the angle, rake, trajectory of suspension, pressure on chassis/handlebars, etc, NOT because you push sticks opposite directions over a jump.If any company brings the ""Burst"" feeling of real life dirtbikes and motocross back it would be nice, but still it hasnt happened.  MX Simulator, while very high learning curve, is the only thing that comes close at this time.Milestone has an Electronic Arts type of attitude evidenced by thier work with racing licenses.  They do the bare minimum, and make a game look like its similar, then market it as if its the ""realest simulation around"" and ""improved on A, B, C, levels"" etc.  You get 720p resolutions in 2017, and essentially the same game, physics, issues, as earlier iterations of the title.  All in all a mediocre title, that feels to have little to no effort given beyond being ""just enough"".I hold out hope Milestone will step up and get the physics and pure power feeling of a motocross bike right, but this year it hasnt happened.5 of 10 is my score, and a C for effort.  I respect that its better than the abomination called MX vs Atv Supercross, but that's not something to hang your hat on."

If you liked MXGP2, you'll like the controls in MXGP3, feels identical to me, but I like the controls.  Aside from visually whips look weird, I play first person anyhow and they look ok there, the controls are good.  I play at basically maxed out difficulty and race length, etc, and it could be a bit harder because some courses the AI just can't even stand a chance against me on the highest setting.I say No to this game for non MXGP fans, but if you're an MXGP fan, you're gonna play it probably.  It's a lot of fun, but these graphics blow me away how bad they are.  It feels like I can't disable enough stuff to make it look normal, and then when I do it looks blocky.  I swear this is still rendered at 720p, it looks bad at 2560x1440.EDITGoing to leave my original review, but add this:  The gameplay is not majorly changed, but the track deformation is pretty good.  The AI is still too weak, but on realistic it's passable on most tracks.  Hopefully they will fix this.  The graphics I have changed my mind on a little, some tracks are not bad, some weather is insanely weird.  I have found a group of settings that works pretty well, disabling things like motion blur, lens flare, etc."

Textures seem like really low quality. I had everything maxed out and no fps issues on my 980.I have a 2560*1080 ultrwide screen which most games can handle theese days, this game not so much. Every thing looks just like regular 1980*1080 then stretched out of proportions.The sounds are bad as well. A max reved out cross machine sounds like a very bad lawnmower in my oppionion.The game play is so so, even with very little experience I came second then first in the two races I managed to do in the stretched environment.This game needs a complete graphics overhaul :(I just requsted a refund, and will find a better investment of my money.Wouldn't recommend this unless it's on sale for €9.99"

If i went into this game blindly without knowing that it was made by milestone i would not think it would be a mxgp game besides knowing the tracks. You can acutally use the ruts made by the bikes in the game and the phycis are a lot loser where it feels more like reflex. Its not a new reflex but its one step closer to a good arcade motocross game.

This is the closest we have come to an actual MX simulator (but we still have a long way to go).I was skeptical about this title, but this is a league ahead of MXGP 2. The bikes ALMOST feel like their real life counterparts. Physics are better, sounds are better, tracks are better, with ruts and lines actually meaning something now. Not to mention the weather conditions changing how you race, two stroke bikes, an insane amount of customisation etc.Unfortunately though, the AI are still way too easy to beat on the hardest difficulty.The game's not perfect (what's with the green rain??) but this is the best we've had in a long time.And now having played this on PC I can say it looks better and even runs better than MXGP 2 did, I've had no issues so far and the resolution problem has been fixed.If you're a MXGP fan, picking this up should be a no brainer."

Only thing I could see improved upon is the shift points in Semi-Auto Transmision mode are bad.  Bike Redlines for a few seconds before shifting to next gear.  Slows you down.  Hopefully the next update will improve this.  You really notice it on 2 strokes as they need every little bit of power to hang in with the big boys.Its also super easy to upgrade your bike via credits.  I would be nice to see alot more play time needed to get upgrades as the best ones come pretty easy so there is no need for the small upgrades.  It would keep players playing to get credits to improve the bike and get upgrades.Again, overall, Great Game.  Cant wait to see what the future updates bring to the game!  Good work Developers!"

Bike sounds are total garbage and the graphics have been blurry since day 1.These are little things that could have been fixed, MX vs ATV fixed them with supercross encore, yet Milestone do nothing.  As is the case with all of their games, and yes, I own almost all of them.This game is fun for a while but the bugs get to you and become incredibly irritating.  LAZY DEVS!You will have to use some magic to make me buy next years game.______________________________________________________________Seems good so far, track deformation is great, you can really use ruts way better than any other game.  Sounds have improved from the last game but that didn't take much!  Still sounds a bit strained when holding it flat out.  Cool you can hear the exhaust pops on de-acceleration though :)The crowd looks awful and is really off putting.  They all use excactly the same annimation  and lag doing so.Would have nice to see more gear, pretty much exactly the same stuff as the last game with a few additions.Also the resolution looks awful but not as bad as when mx vs atv supercross was released on PC.  Hopefully they will fix it soon!I certainly recommend buying the game, they just need to iron out some of the bugs!!"
