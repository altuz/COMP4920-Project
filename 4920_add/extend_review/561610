76561198069738592,Not Recommended,561610,32912694,Posted: 27 June,all,ryan0157,"This game has a lot of improvements over the 2015 title like improved graphics and a ""consistent"" 60 FPS,  the sound model for this game is amazing and you can actually hear your own bike over those around you (a necessity for manual shifting). Milestone has improved the feel of the bikes massively and also improved the entire interface of the game. However Milestone has yet to correct the issues that the 15 title had like AI riders pulling across the racing line and weaving slowly back and forth as they leave the pits in all practice sessions, there is still the issue where the AI riders are nearly a second or two faster in the race than they are in qualifying and their lines are completely different from what is shown in any practice or qualifying session without any explanation, the issue where the game freezes your screen completely and screws up anything you were doing is still present. Also the devs have removed your ability to leave the pits on your own, you are now forced into a flying lap with no time  adjustments to the session as if you were allowed onto the track before the timer started. Overall I am disappointed to have spent so much on a game that offered so little improvements. I would have thought that a company that got the rights to produce a game after MotoGP would have done a better job, and I really don't expect any updates to correct any of these issues because that seems to be a common trend with milestone."

AI still sucks, their main menu to get into the game is still garbage, and the game still bogs itself down at certain times on certian tracks.  Maybe one day, someone will make an awesome MotoGP game, but it won't happen from milestone."

I've put at least 24+ hours in each MotoGP title since MotoGP 13. Here is my suggestion: If you've played a Milestone MotoGP game before, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! This is nothing but a re-skin of the previous MotoGP titles.The GOOD:- The sounds have improved compared to older titles.- Track textures are better. (My track texture setting is set to 4GB)- The harder AI has increased in difficulty. (A little faster than older titles)- The new ""manager career mode"" is a nice touch.The BAD:- The customization in this game is so limited, it is actually frustrating. There is a lot of untapped potential.- The AI will bump you off the racing line more often than not.- You cannot create multiple saves in your career modes. There is only one save slot for the regular career mode and the manager career mode. (That means only one team!)- There are numerous bugs that make the career mode a frustrating and UNPLAYABLE adventure.The community has been reporting the same bugs for over 4 years, but somehow the same bugs make their way onto the newer titles. There have been bugs that have been previously FIXED in older titles, but the new titles still have those same bugs. The steam forum for this game is full of threads about bugs and glitches. Someone has made an online petition to change the developer for MotoGP and it hasn't even been a week since the game came out! Spend your money somewhere else! For people that have never played a MotoGP game before and want to enter the scene, I STRONGLY recommend waiting for the next version of this game."

The bike oversteers nicely when on the gas out of apex and the sound and overall experience is very immersive too. I found all rider views to be fun and offer a different perspective and I was really surprised with the level of control available with the 'front of bike cam', which I never use on bike gamesTHe physics overall are very good, accurate and fun which is also what is enjoyable about riding real bikes.My in game settings that I find most fun are hard difficulty, semi pro physics, track help off, auto brake off, trajectoy line off, opponent indicator off, rider names off, steering help on.Im also loving the fact that the ghost feature is back and it makes time trials with friends or solo all the more fun.I am experiencing a screen jitter every now and then but im sure they will patch it up soonOverall highly recommended if you are a rider and are looking for that awesome ride feeling from a game.If Milestone were looking for more direction I would say keep working on that sound design as its certainly heading in the right direction and a huge improvement over the last games. I would like to see a bit more bike movement when the bike starts to brake traction or with things like headshake out of corners or if bumping another rider. And if your listening Milestone -  I would love to see standup wheelies as an option :P"

There are some bugs (first screen when the race is loaded is sometimes black), the start is still too easy.. but in general i have the impression that the game itself is not that easy as the previous titles. and finally, the sounds are better, the bikes don't sound like a lawn mower!"

It's essentially the same game - similar graphics, heck even the bike setup process is exactly the same! The only improvement seems to be improved sound and latest riders. Even the manager mode is bad. It's so crude! Definitely do not buy if it's not on a sale (which could soon, going the game quality)."

So, you can't see what the sponsors are offering to your team.- At the bigining of every race you find a black screen, you have to press ENTER to move forward.- You can't hear the TV commentator at the begining of the race, like in the others modes.This is some of the bugs I have found soo far. This kind of things could be fixed with patches. Hope that the developers create one soon...... Looking forward to play F1 2017. MotoGP 17 have a long road to be at the same level of F1 2016"

,Not Recommended,561610,32602936,Posted: 20 June,all,7 Kingdoms,I wish Milestone was never existed... I wish Codemasters or some other publisher made this game. It's motorcycle racing and it s full of potential. It's pure adrenaline but we get the same game for almost 4 years.I think Milestone would be a perfect fit for mariokart games. Because they are incredibly talented at making arcade racing games. Players are wanting a proper motorcycle racing game like a simulation (because there is non) and you came up with this. It's pathethic.Anyone with a little practice can ride it on a 'simulation(!)' mode and anyone with a logic can easily beat the hardest AI because they really don't care. Same sh*t AI for years.I want a bit of physics and I want a bit of challenge. That's really what I want. We don't need graphics. We need physics and challenge.They won't gonna read this anyway.SO in summary:-Average graphics.-Worst AI in the universe.-Poor and incredibly repetitive game modes.-Absolutely no challenging which is the first priority for the racing games.-Got no physics.-If you are gonna play it then play it as an arcade game because it's definetely not a racing simulation.-Poor customization-Because they couldn't get the licenses for the helmets there are only 2 brands.-This game is a huge fail just like it's publisher.

Milestone, please fix them!The good:Sound is the best it has ever been in a MotoGP title by far.Race starts are a lot more fun / more realistic (long way to go though.)The graphics are amazing, best they've been.More advanced liveries than MotoGP 15. Much more advanced.The bad:Soooo many bugs.Rewind breaks completely if used near the finish line.The Parc Ferme cutscenes are both hilarious (animation quality is frankly,♥♥♥♥♥♥) and horrofying (None of the characters have eyelids!).Managerial Career Mode seems very unbalanced and a lot is unexplained. So unclear.AI will completely screw up sometimes - suiciding into you or anywhere else.Many camera positions are broken and untested.This game is fantastic but is marred by bugs, which ruins an otherwise amazing game. Should've delayed the launch by two weeks - these are all just minor polishing issues!Hoping for a bug fix soon!"
76561198035308461,Recommended,561610,32449503,Posted: 15 June,all,BradHoyt,"Long story short, I have a GROSS amount of experience with all milestone games, and am an avid realife sportbiker of the liter type. So here's my take:Is it revolutionary? No. But much like sportbikes themselves this game has evolved into a finely balanced machine.I'm sure there are some bugs for people, I run 2 1080s - flawless performace, but the first race is blank until you exit to the menu and simply try again.SOUND - Soundgasm, period. Compared to all their other games this one is brand spanking new. You can hear the engine internals and the air being sucked into the engine and everything. Sound dudes should get a bonus.Handling is tweaked to represent a real motogp race machine on those surfaces - it's pretty freakin realistic; put it on Pro ♥♥♥♥♥es. People saying its not a simulator -- what the ♥♥♥♥ are you comparing it to? This is creme de la creme buddy.It's not a guided nightmare like VR46, its a classic motogp game with career modes etc.The menu's are pretty dank - very crisp. HUD - Its like I'm watching, great tach/speedo.Right off the bat you can customize your dude(or chick icon lol), with nice stuff without spending horsecrap money. I work in real life ya know let me get a black helmet, its great.Best part of customization - Bikes! You can make your own sick looking motogp bike based upon 9 general templates per bike type.I dropped 50 bucks on it, because I'm willing to support essentially the only people that make sportbiking into a realistic game! Ride 2 plus MxGp 3 plus Motogp17 is pretty much the total package at this point, and they are all polished AF compared to anything else that tries to attempt including it's earlier renditions."
76561198009944231,Not Recommended,561610,34621146,Posted: 30 August,all,sbk1198,"I'll do the review relative to previous Milestone MotoGP games. Graphics are slightly improved, although not much. One might expect better for being 2017. The game is easier to play for the user, as in it's easier to do good laps without crashing as much. AI is still just as dumb and charges at you without thinking, but at least it is better/more difficult in terms of lap times. On hardest difficulty, some races can be a bit challenging actually when starting from the back of the grid, unlike the previous versions of MotoGP. It's crazy how the AI bikes have an incredible amount of speed going into the turns and mid-corner speed, and then it's like they park it on the exit of the corners. Very unrealistic. Makes it difficult and pass and make the pass stick.Now as for the real bad stuff....game crashes ALL THE FREAKIN TIME!!  Online still sucks, and to make it worse, it barely works. I've only been able to do 5 races online out of at least 10 attempts. Lots of connection issues (and no, it's not my internet that's the problem). When it does work, there is still no option to communicate with the other players. Seriously, that is 15 year old technology! It's not that hard. Put that feature in Milestone!!! Another thing that's still lacking is a stats feature. It'd be nice to have a place where you can go and see what your best lap times are at every track in every class, how many wins, pole positions, etc. If I recall WSBK Generations had something like that...why can't we have that in a MotoGP game?? It's not that hard to keep track of that data.Overall...typical Milestone game. Don't expect this one to be much different than the others in the past. Lots of bugs still that they can't seem to fix before they release the game or care to do it at any point after."

Played rider career like I did in MotoGP15 and was stunned by the improvement in sound, handling and graphics. Let alone the better racing lines and better menu and HUD. The weather on the track actually changes the times and handling of the bike unlike it did in MotoGP15.As well as this, when starting a wet race in MotoGP15 the bike would often get squirrelly and push you back 10 places (if you're lucky, sometimes you go from pole to last) but in MotoGP17 theres no such issue.There are also far greater differences between the difficulties of the AI making winning more rewarding and fun. I used to be 10-20 seconds ahead on the simulation difficulty of MotoGP15 but now I'm having to fight hard for the victory in Moto3 on hard mode.Overall a brilliant game, can't wait to try out all the game has to offer!"

Of the Motogp series I think 08 was my first. However before that I was a big fan of the Superbike series from EA. They were my favorite back then. The last one of this series I have is Motogp 13. I can safely say for me that this is a step in the right direction. It's definitely better than 13. For me the control is better, the new career modes are great and the racing just feels better. To me at least. To any one on the fence , it's a geat game . Could it improve? For sure, they all could though a bit. If you have last years version it may not be enough to warrant this one.

,Not Recommended,561610,32449896,Posted: 15 June,all,Kozlic,"After playing two full weekends in the Managerial mode I have this to say:The good:+The sound and the graphics are better+A lot harder A.I. to beat than in GP 15**do not get excited. See below whyThe bad/the weird:-The BIGGEST problem this game has (besides the crashing) is other riders following the racing line no matter what. If you are slower than the rider behind you, they will just crash straight into you as if you were not there at all. All the crashes I had was because of that.-When you cross the finish line you get one time but under your ""best lap"" you get a different time...about 0.015-0.020 difference.-Another thing that bothers me A LOT is that in practice or qualifying you only get times comparing you to the best rider, and not your best lap. Which helps you improve as you can see in which sectors you are doing bad. This was great in MotoGP 15.-Still no FP2,3,...Only FP1 in ""full weekend""..not a big issue but still would be good having the option.-Dashboard rev. meter does not show revs in first person view as it did in MotoGP 15.-You dont get your times deleted if you go out of track (as happened a lot in this season's moto 3)-Why are there 2 bikes in the garage in Moto 3? In reality riders only have 1.-A.I. 2sec per lap faster in race than in qualifiers, is not affected by tyre wearConclussion:I do not recommend getting this game. The patch only fixed a very small minority of the bugs and whatever's wrong with the game. It's not just bugs it's like the developers never watched Moto GP. Only get this if you do not watch Moto GP and want an arcade game to kill time with. But it's a bit expensive for that. My refund request got denied because I spent 10 hours watching a frozen screen and that apparently counts as ""playing"". 50eur wasted. I would rather flush it down the drain."

They are still not like the real sounds but 1000 times better than the sounds in any MotoGP game before. Sound is very important for me and due to the better sounds it is more fun to me.- The game runs better. On my system it runs with at least 150 FPS on highest settings and often even with 200 FPS (GTX 1060, 16GB RAM, i5). I did not have any crash yet and it runs very smoothly.- The menu is cleaned up and looks better than in the MotoGP games before.- There is a Manager mode. You build your own team, you develope your team and your riders and you can design your own bikes. I really like this mode.- The XBox One Controller works great.- I can feel the tire wear more than in any MotoGP game before. I always only play on 50% race distance and I never felt any tire wear. This time I can feel the tire wear in the last third of the distance.Neutral:- The graphics is not really up to date but still looks okay. The bikes and drivers look amazing. You can see this when you zoom in in the photo mode. The race tracks look not that good but it is okay for me. In F1 2016 the tracks also do not look that good and the cars look much better.Negative:- The AI is absolutely bad. The higher you set the difficulty, the faster are their bikes and they can break later. They are not driving better, their bikes are simply getting better. Their lap times in the race are faster than in the qualifying and they seem to have no tire wear. When it is raining then some AI drivers can still drive as fast as they can when the track is dry.- There are still some bugs (when my controller vibrates then it sometimes does not stop vibrating, my chosen number is sometimes not illustrated correctly on my bike...).- The online mode needs to be improved a lot. At the moment it is just a mess.- It is still not really a simulation. Physics, driving and the feeling are still far aways from a real simulation.- I still do not have any MotoGP feeling . When you visit the races or watch them in TV then you feel the spirit of MotoGP. They need to add more things that make you feel that you are really playing a MotoGP game (warm-up lap, cool-down lap, better award ceremonies...), just like Codemasters did in F1 2016.- Still no changing weather. It would be cool when the weather would change during running races so that you have to drive into the pit to change your bike.So why do I recommend it:I like the game more than any other MotoGP and I am a MotoGP fan. I like the sounds which make me like the game. It is definitely the best of all MotoGP games and I have a lot of fun with it.I would not recommend this game to anybody who is looking for a absolute motorcycle simulation and who is not a fan of MotoGP. If you are looking for a motorcycle racing game to have fun with, then you can buy it."
