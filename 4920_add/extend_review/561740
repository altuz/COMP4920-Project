,Not Recommended,561740,32421592,Posted: 14 June,all,saj14saj,"I won't re-explain the game or its features, as the main page and many of the other reviews do that very well.I want to like this game.   But it trips on its own feet too often.The most annoying thing about the game is not that you die a lot (you do, a lot).   It's that the deaths are almost always random, unpredictable, and not something you can learn from and play better next time.Also annoying is the number of times you read, right on the screen, ""Not implemented yet"" for some feature.   This, in a game that is out of early access.The final straw is that the UI is exceedingly clumsy.  For example, there is no quick bar for activating potions or possessions, so the  only way to  use an item is to open the inventory (which covers nearly the entire screen), select the item there, and then manually close it.  Every single time.Another UI awkwardness is the way the identify scroll is implemented.   Obviously, since identify scrolls live in your inventory, to use one, you must already have your inventory open.   And yet, when you use the scroll, instead of being able to  directly click on a target, a second popup window of your inventory appears, out of alignment from your main inventory, making target selection disconcerting and slow.   Then after you click the target, you have to scan your main inventory window and re-hover over the item to read its identified statistics.There is probably the core of a good game here, but it is not yet ready for prime time.   I hope that the developer, who seems engaged in supporting it, will bring it up to its potential, but right now, I suggest waiting instead of buying."

I feel casuals wouldn't make it very far in MidBoss.Getting down to the 6th floor has been a lot of fun, but accidentally clicking new game or creating a custom game instantly deleted my saved game. Probably won't be able to look at the game for a while.I hope they implement save slots or something. I'd still recommend, but instantly deleting your saves in a time consuming game like this is very stupid."
76561198020275974,Recommended,561740,32650039,Posted: 22 June,all,teioh,"Midboss is one of the most unique and engrossing roguelikes I've played. The possession mechanic adds a ton of variety to what you do as you dungeon crawl, the aesthetics and music are quirky and lighthearted, and the Grave Goods system that allows you to carry over magic items you've collected in previous runs to your next run makes the sting of death feel a little bit lighter. The game's mechanics are deep enough where you can get lost in its crunchiness but doesn't require you to spend 20 hours figuring out how each stat interacts with each other to have fun. Overall, there's a little bit of everything for everyone, and I think even people who are wary of roguelikes would enjoy this game."
76561198000896476,Recommended,561740,33841515,Posted: 27 July,all,PressOK,"Excellent Roguelike, a perfect example of how depth and replayability can grow from very simple mechanics. Difficulty is not to be underestimated, stats system as of the current version is relatively unique and takes some consideration when leveling up / gearing up / choosing forms.It is always nice when you have a turn-based game where you can casually rush through the ""grind"" parts, and then stop and seriously plan out the tricky fights.The grave-goods system (being able to keep an item from a previous run) is more than an interesting mechanic - the first few levels can be slow, but starting with a higher level item can really expedite the grind and get you back to where you died pretty quickly.Future patches seem to be planning to add more content based on what I've read. In it's current state, I'd give it a solid 4/5 and say it is more than fairly priced for a game developed by just a couple main developers (?) and other help. If more content is added, easily a 5/5 and the best turn-based roguelike to surface on Steam in YEARS."
76561197968907104,Not Recommended,561740,34653338,Posted: 1 September,all,TheSHEEEP,"tl;dr: Has potential, but is THAT kind of roguelike and has absolutely no variance in the early levels.I really tried to like this game. There is huge promise here.There are also many annoyances here (such as no having no shortcuts for items - wtf?) and the death card mechanic simply not working (I have many cards, yet always the same two ones show up when a new char is created), etc.But what really breaks this game is that when you die, it will not be your own fault.Now, I know this sounds like whining from someone having no clue what he is doing, but let me tell you, I have played them all: ADOM, ToME, Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup, Caves Of Qud, Dwarf Fortress, Rogue: Legacy, Everspace, etc. And also finished them all (at least those that really have a ""finished"" state). I do know what I talk about when talking about roguelikes.In good roguelikes (especially the best, ToME), you will know what you did wrong when you died. You might have been too brave, ill-prepared, used wrong spells, etc. You get punished for mistakes and rewarded for playing well. As it should be.In bad roguelikes, the game may at any point throw random **** your way that you have no way to be prepared against and that will just kill you, no matter what.Unfortunately, MidBoss belongs to the second category. It doesn't matter how well you play, how much attention you pay to your stats. You can do everything perfectly (as will be evident by having a generally easy time and some momentum) - and then there will be some enemy that has stats so far above anything you could have achieved so far that he just obliterates you. If you manage to get to floor 5, which has no doubt the craziest difficulty spike I have ever seen in a game, you will know what I mean.Now, Caves of Qud does that, too, but at least the beginning of the game is varied.In MidBoss, you will have to live through the first floors again. And again. And again.And let me tell you, the first floors are ALWAYS the same. Slightly different room layout, yes, but the enemy types are always the same, your loot will always be the same (as the right piece of equipment for you is easily discernable). Everything is the same, always.There is nothing like in Rogue: Legacy or Everspace that would give you a boost after a while so you could at least skip those early levels and get to the interesting parts. Nope. The death cards are a drop in the ocean, since what really matters is your character level. Plus, they seem to be very buggy - as written above, they don't even work right for me.You will grind through the early floors, ""collecting"" the same essential enemies to mastery, leveling up the same stats best for your chosen playstyle... it is a nightmarish version of Groundhog Day with no variance whatsoever.What a shame. It could be easily resolved by randomizing the abilities of enemies or simply which enemy appears on which floor, but since all of that is fixed, you will be bored out of your mind by the 10th time you have to do it all again - latest."
,Recommended,561740,33781167,Posted: 25 July,all,Kimau,Midboss is a highly addictive and fun dungeon crawler with a unique twist and punny sense of humour.It has loads of options and a fun death mechanic. The start can get a little repetitive though turning up the movent speed and you can fly through first two levels quickly then it opens up.Overall an interesting an unique game which pulled me in and kept me engaged longer than I planned every time.
76561197970003570,Recommended,561740,33782286,Posted: 25 July,all,Ishikawa,A refreshing change on the traditional rogue-like formula. The possession system enables an incredible wide variety of tactical depth to the tried and true dungeon crawling formula. The card system is a unique natural extension of the old tombstone messages found in traditional rogue-likes like DCSS or Nethack.The item system provides many varieties and rarity levels so the loot hunting loop feels similar to prominent well-known Blizzard titles.Nice touches are the additional render styles which can be enabled with various potions (so i would like to see less of them once i've unlocked them all).Overall a very enjoyable and refreshing experience.Would crawl again!
,Recommended,561740,32047955,Posted: 29 May,all,tinf,"Great traditional rogue-like with a neat possession mechanic. You possess enemies to learn their abilities, which makes for very varied gameplay in all stages of a playthrough. You feel powerful when you master enemy types and combine their different abilities in your standard imp form.The game also features a fun sidekick character called Mid, (who always calls you Boss), which gives the game additional charm with funny quips and helpful tips."
,Recommended,561740,32741469,Posted: 24 June,all,angusiguess,"I really enjoy roguelikes that have very focused mechanics. I probably have the most hours logged on Brogue, which has no levelling and focuses entirely on equipment and dungeons.MidBoss does a great job of focusing on a single mechanic as well, with the entire game focusing on posession. ""Equipment"" is mostly passive and active abilities from enemies.It's a game that lets me hop in and play for a half hour or so, but also had excellent depth.If you're into very focused rogulikes, this might be your jam!"
76561198024928669,Recommended,561740,32052656,Posted: 29 May,all,bensanaz,"A solid roguelike with entertaining job-class-style mechanics as its central feature. Putting together synergistic hybrid monsters is fun (the palette changes based on your secondary monster are a nice touch) and there's at least enough equipment variety to give some interesting decisions over what to equip.If I have one complaint, it's that there's fairly limited variety in low-level monsters, so the very start of runs tends to be a little samey and slow - builds won't really start to diverge until the third or fourth floor (depending on equipment found) and the floors are large enough that if you're a stickler for thorough looting it'll take a little while to get there. Filling out the one-skill creatures with an extra skill or two, even mediocre ones, would go a long way towards fixing that. (Acid Bat and Lightning Bat, I'm looking at you - Vampire Bat gets a bunch of bat-themed extra skills, so it's not clear why the other bats don't get even one of them.) Once it gets going, though, it's a lot of fun."

I'm not a hardcore roguelike fan,  and appreciated the totally optional ways you can make the game enjoyable regardless of what level of difficulty you are looking for these types of ""die and start over"" games. Really enjoyed leveling up the various forms you can take just to find out what the next unlock ability was, and playing with mixing and matching different bonuses from different forms creates a lot of fun ways to play."

The possession system is fun, the graphics are nice and cute and the music gives the game a playful atmosphere.On the negative side the UI is a bit wonky. You can't hotkey items, some standard ways UI's usually work in these types of games don't work, and management of the all too small inventory is a mess.Updates also aren't very frequent. The last update the game received was a week or two after the release in June and after that it hasn't received any updates."

The Death Cards are the best implementation of a bones file / seed / memorial (all in one) I have ever seen, and the posession mechanic makes the game snappy and fun at all times. You get to balance the ups and downs of keeping a familiar form, ganking a new one for a quick top-up of health, or mastering many forms and running around as Das UberImp.It's a great game and I 100% recommend it, especially at the price."

,Recommended,561740,33889102,Posted: 29 July,all,nothingxs,"I originally had purchased the beta for this game long before it was on Steam, and, quite frankly, with all the finished features, it is a much, MUCH better game than it was way back when I originally played it.I recommend it to everyone. Possessing enemies is a really interesting feature for a roguelike and I'm having a blast playing it."
76561198019271689,Recommended,561740,32620546,Posted: 21 June,all,Callin,"What a great game and a neat, unusual take on the hardcore Roguelike formula. If you at all like Roguelikes, get this immediately.First off: even if you have played hundreds of hours of ToME, ADOM, Qud, Cogmind, DCSS, etc., don't expect to not die a lot in your first hour or three of this game. It's a very different beast and quite clever. It hides its great complexity behind a very polished GUI (although more actions need keyboard shortcuts).I really don't want to say more, because frankly a lot of the fun for me was playing this game with really almost no preconceived notions of what it is and how it works and discovering it for myself. However, I will say a few things to whet your appetite.The primary game mechanic is possession of other dungeon dwellers. Your powers and skills merely modify the capabilities of the creatures you possess. When you're not in possession of someone else, you can use some of your abilities learned from your possessees, but if your not-in-possession self dies... Game over. (Of course, it's a roguelike.) You also don't have any health regen (nor its attendant food mechanic), which took some getting used to.The second really unusual (unique to my experience) mechanic is the Death Cards. From a purely mechanical standpoint, they let you carry one item over from another game. However, more than that they are shareable records of your game, allowing you to replay the exact same seed or challenging your friends to that same seed. And, they look cool to boot.The author contributed to a recent episode of Roguelike Radio. It's worth a listen - but I recommend a few hours of play first so you don't get any spoilers. :)"
76561198001428678,Recommended,561740,34268932,Posted: 15 August,all,DrEnzyme,"Midboss is a simple Roguelike with just enough mechanical depth to keep the experienced player interested, while maintaining enough simplicity to keep the new player attached. The familiar trappings are all there; gods, tomes, potions, scrolls, weapons and armor, but the way they are presented is somewhat simpler than tradtional roguelikes such as Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup or Nethack. Potions start off unidentified, but can largely be quaffed with impunity, for their effects are largely unpunishing. Altars exist, but function as a one-off sacrifice mechanic that lets the player experiment to discover each god's preferences.This simplicity is carried over into the enemies. At first, Midboss's enemy selection could be seen as meagre, but this is largely mitigated by the possession system; Midboss's main point of difference. Any enemy in the game can be possessed, as long as you possess the strength to defeat it. Each ""form"" you take has its own skills/abilities, and is levelled up independently to other forms. Forms can also be mixed and matched in order to combine the abilities of your fallen foes in interesting ways. The depth of the possession system is what sets the game apart from other roguelikes. Do you take a rat's speed over a Zombie's strength? Do you take a warlock's magical prowess over a minataur's charge? These are the sorts of decisions you have to make constantly in order to survive the game, especially when it starts throwing enemies at you with powerful specialisations.In conclusion, whether or not you'll enjoy Midboss is largely dependent on the sort of gamer you are. Midboss functions as a perfect entry point for new and semi-experienced roguelike players, but might not have enough depth to keep veterans of traditional roguelikes interested."

The U.I. and controls feel proper in its genre, and information seems to be intuitively available.Perhaps the only part of confusion was in regards to the unique Mechanic of the game to take over monsters and how to effectively unlock/keep/move over their abilities and such - But all of that becomes rather clear after a few runs!I would love to see more people try out this wonderful lil' gem, it feels like a weird cross between Dungeons of Dredmor and Kirby ;)The game unfortunately does not have a non-perma Death Mode, which I hope they might consider eventually for those that are looking for Roguelikes without it - Given its accessible design I think they should consider it to attact a wider audience."

This is an original game about possessing your enemies and using their bodies to beat eachother to death without having to get your own hands dirty. I would like to make clear that this is my own opinion and I am writing it of my own free will, and have not been possessed by a demon and forced to write praises for this game in order to keep my soul.This is a good game if you or the demon that has definitely not possessed your body enjoys any of the following:* Possession* Pixel art* Possession* Felicitious Feline Merchants with frankly felonious prices* Fish, specifically in crates* Possession* Naked skeletons and demons* Artisanal system design* PermadeathAlso this game features possession, but I must stress that I have not in any way been possessed."
,Recommended,561740,32716982,Posted: 24 June,all,AntiPseudonym,"Charming and clever. The possession mechanic really compliments the more tranditional roguelike elements nicely, as it has you constantly thinking about which creature you want to possess and when, as each has unique abilities that can suit different circumstances.The graphic style is incredibly evocative of older PC isometric RPGs, and successfully manages to capture the retro feel while not feeling like it's pandering to nostalgia."

,Recommended,561740,32207750,Posted: 5 June,all,Super Skirt,"I am actually really impressed with this game! At face value it is a great rogue-like dungeon crawler, with loot randomization, procedural generation, and perma-death. I am a sucker for these types of games and would probably play it, even if it didn't have the added features that make it truly unique. Death cards are a great little feature that shows a little snippet of your character's life, and the game allows you to drag/drop and share on social media. That's not really my cup of tea, but they also allow you to choose an item to take on subsequent lives. You can choose one item from up to 6 separate death cards, which can give you a huge boost. (At least that's how it seems to work for me, but I'll be honest, it took me a while to figure out that system.)The way that the game allows you to possess enemy bodies and take their abilities is such a cool idea, and it's not a complicated system, which is what I was really afraid of when I started playing. I like my dungeon crawlers to be super easy to jump into. I am not a huge fan of using my keyboard to move in this game because it's isometric, but using my mouse works just fine.Overall, I would definitely recommend this game, it's a great little dungeon crawler with a ton of replayability!"

76561197963093943,Recommended,561740,32697116,Posted: 23 June,all,dstall,"This is a very well made game.  If you are looking for an answer to ""Should I buy this?"" my answer would be yes, for sure.To add a little more depth, Midboss follows along with the classic rogue formula (permadeath, potion identification, etc.) but adds the twist of learning skills through the possesion of the various monsters you fight while descending through the dungeon.  Throw in some RPG elements such as character progression through level-ups and the result is a very addictive game.  The overall experience is a much more streamlined and focussed game compared to many roguelikes.  This isn't going to replace DCSS or TOME4 for your go-to deep gaming experience, but we all need something a bit lighter from time to time.  This game reminds me a bit of Dungeons of Dredmor rather than Nethack.The killer feature of this game is really the death card system.  Every time you die, a death card is generated.  You can use this card to carry over one item to a new run through the dungeon.  If you have multiple death cards, you can pick one item from each (up to six I believe), so even upon your inevitable death there is something gained for another try.  Even cooler, these death cards can be shared with other players.  You can examine another player's card to see how they built that character, what forms they used the most and what skills they preferred.  It is a neat way to learn about the game from other players.There is still room for improvement, and the developer is eager to hear from players and is very receptive to suggestions.  A few areas that will be receiving some attention are inventory management and better explanations of the various statistics.  Melee builds could probably use a bit of a buff while magic builds could probably stand a bit of a nerf.  None of these issues take away from a very well made and fun game right now however.Also, major kudos for a native Linux build from the start.The music and sound effects are also top notch.If you are a fan of roguelikes, Midboss should be on your radar (and in your library)."

It's bad BAD business.I actually bought this in spite of their public immaturity, hoping I'd find a diamond in the rough. Instead, I've found another candidate for a refund.Otherwise, for what it's worth, the basic mechanic is surprisingly promising....(Edit: I just realized this is the game’s first negative review… So I am effectively kicking the hornets’ nest. But, I can only imagine the feedback so far has been so positive because most fans of true Rogue Like games - which this is - are very forgiving and used to dealing with the genres idiosyncrasies; which this game has in spades. I, for one, am not so forgiving. There are plenty of far superior Rogue Likes on Steam at equal or lower price points.)"

,Recommended,561740,32700050,Posted: 23 June,all,Strix,"It's a great modern roguelike! I love, love the rhythm of the possession mechanic in this game - you don't heal by resting or by using fountains, you heal by possessing the enemies you defeat and taking their forms. This is also how you learn skills, get better stats, and become cuter with every iteration of yourself!But, okay, let me back up. MidBoss is a game about being a lowly dungeon imp who decides to become the biggest, baddest monster in the dungeon while everyone's distracted fighting heroes. Cue possessing your former allies to steal their skills, killing everyone, and selling loot to the thoroughly neutral merchant so you can buy more powerful equipment.As it's a roguelike, the core gameplay loop is simple: explore, get better at learning when to run vs fight, mastery over your skills, etc etc - and then you make a mistake and die. Which is fine! The gameplay is so tight you'll enjoy playing more of it and getting better with every run - or luckier! My last run I found a flaming sword I could possess, and it was really good at killing things! I swapped over to an acid bat when it got low on health, but misjudged if I could take on a zombie or not. That was my fault, and I'll be more careful next time - and the next, and the next!Death lets you carry over at least one of your items - and oh, items! You find all kinds of things, equipment, potions, scrolls, earrings - all kinds of stuff you pick up Diablo-style (press alt to make the items show up on the floor with fancy icons) and then throw into your inventory. Here's a flaw: you can't auto-sort your inventory, and it's kind of tight, but it's a minor hassle at most. It's easy to dump stuff and money isn't too tight.So! MidBoss is good: it's beautiful, has music, plays really well, and has enough depth to justify going back in again and again. I know I'll beat it someday, and until then the attempts are fun. (And why yes, I do see those options in the ""custom game"" section. Mix up the gameplay? Don't mind if I do~)Final note: MidBoss has a unique death card system where when you die, it makes a pretty little image of your final moments and a cute summary of how you played. It's a good way to reflect on your mistakes, and share them with your friends. I like it a lot!"
,Recommended,561740,32712850,Posted: 23 June,all,KC,"MidBoss is a very very very lovely game and I WISH I HAD MORE TIME TO PLAY IT. So many different aspects appeal to me super hard. The art style is cute, the writing is fun and silly, the music is pretty and fits the general vibe of the game super well, and the gameplay is *tight*. It's good ole dungeon crawling, with a super neat possession mechanic. Your base form, Imp, has its own stats, health, stamina, etc. But if you tag an enemy with your Possession spell and then defeat them, you (SURPRISE) possess them. You became that which you killed, replacing your stats with that monster's stats, as well as picking up skills from that monster as you level up in your new-found body. If you max out the level of that form (the level cap varies from creature to creature) you can then equip that form to your main form, assuming you shed it. Gaining bonuses and a neat color swap depending on the creatures you have equipped, as well as access to all the skills you learned.This is just a VERY basic explanation to the mechanic, but this mechanic alone is a crazy huge driving point for the gameplay in general and it seemed like the best thing to focus on for this review. You can have some wicked fun with it, and there's a lot of other fun mechanics that mesh well with it. So I HIGHLY recommend making sure you don't miss out on this gem. <3"

It has a very oldschool feel to it in mechanics and gameplay that takes me back to long nights of exploring dungeons and making unfortunate choices about drinking unidentified potions. The art style is simple, but charming, and I really like the bobble effect of charcters moving around almost like they're board game pieces. Not only does this game ooze charm, it has enough depth and complexity that I will be coming back even after the initial cuteness begins to wear off.If you're a fan of classic roguelikes, MidBoss is true enough to the formula to tick most boxes, and even if you're not, it's fresh and complex enough to keep you coming back."

,Recommended,561740,32189090,Posted: 4 June,all,Zero-Sennin,"Note: this is based mostly on my experience with quickplay.I don't play a lot of roguelike games, but I gave Midboss a shot largely because the idea was appealing enough for me to stretch my boundaries a bit.I'm glad I did.This game has a large variety of abilities and is clear enough on a surface level for someone like me to conceive of a playstyle and seek out monsters and abilities that can help me embody that playstyle. I can tell that there's a lot more depth and complexity than what I personally am interacting wtih, but it speaks well to the game itself that at a zero-level I can gain a basic understanding of how to make the experience fall in line with the way I want to customize my character.The music, sounds, and visual effects are also spot on--everything feels like it fits, and characterizes the game as being both light-hearted and fairly tense.What I like most is the death card system, and how it not only lets you hold onto items that you had on you if you die, but it also enumerates skills and the monsters that gave them based on what forms you mastered--and that's more important than anything else if you're really invested in self-cataloguing what abilities are most useful to you.The game's well worth the money. If you like roguelikes, try it out."

It is very crashy (I've had fatal errors three times now), but recovers from the crashes pretty easily, they're a huge pita though since I'm playing on a Steam Link primarily. It also doesn't run at all on my 2011 Macbook Air (doesn't meet processor requirements T___T). Despite all that, it's really promising after a first run. I'll probably check back in later, but just wanted to thumbs up this and say you should power through the crashes. And I'll share my Steam Link controller profile w/ community once I get something good ironed out."

And you go possessing things arround. As you should know if you read any description of the game.What you maybe don't know is that this is some really classy rogue-like game. I mean really. Turn based, LOTS of numbers. HARD. I mean really HARD. The info you're given in the tutorial can be overwhelming but it's quite manageble from this genre.Once you get to the second flor, you die, basically. Then go try again xDThere is not much more I han tell you about this. It's way more similar to the original rogue than the art style hints and that what modern ""rogue-likes"" use to be, but if you like the genre you'll like this game. I loved the attention to detail it has, the music is quite good and the dialogues are really fun."

The game is currently being detected as a trojan for no reason, no other anti virus programs have noticed anything fishy about the game even when they scan the files. Besides that one issue, i highly recommend this game to anyone who loves the dungeon crawler genre and is looking for a fun unique rogue-like.(edit)Kaspersky issue solved!http://steamcommunity.com/app/561740/discussions/0/1291817208500295267/"

,Recommended,561740,32488383,Posted: 16 June,all,Mattimieo,"I have been following the producting of this game for a little while and am really pleased with the mechanics.Pros:- Problem solving between staying alive (by possessing a new form) or dealing damage, having a better form, exploring, etc.- Items are plentiful and feel easy to get so the brutality of the rogue-like-ness of the game doesn't make me feel frustraitedCons:- the keyboard controls, I ended up using the mouse- on mac (at least mine), button hitboxes are slightly higher than the graphics on the screen- introduction text is ALOT and wordy, but after the first 20min it is gone and fine- Could use a little more variety of ui and art for cutscenes and dialogue. Personal preference.- Could use some puzzle design, but I get that it is a dungeon crawler.Fun to waste time with!"
,Recommended,561740,34195264,Posted: 12 August,all,Patches,"It's a neat game and I enjoyed it, but it's a bit too brutal. As you learn the game you get an idea of how strong enemies are and how strong you need to be to fight them, until then you'll get into bad encounters every playthough. There's no escaping a bad encounter (with a few exceptions). A good run suddenly ends because you picked the wrong fight. Dying wouldn't be such and issue, but...Each playthrough also feels the same because you find the same enemies with only a little variation. Had the enemies been more randomized throughout the game I think this would be a lot better."

The core posses mechanic is quite novel and fun.However, the game itself is just too simple; it doesn't take long before the combat is dull and repetitive....and don't get me started on all the damn crates...and the bookshelves that you (for some reason) have to hit TWICE to destroy (Why is that even a thing? How is that fun or interesting?)If this game had about twice the complexity and much more usability/friendly UI, it would be great.But, as it currently stands...refund.Sorry."

I think the difficulty curve is perfect for me - you don't get roflstomped from your first playthrough, but there's a lot to learn before you are really progressing through to deeper levels.I NEVER write reviews but I am doing so for this game because I think it's totally worth adding to your library, but it looks like it's slipping under the radar. Don't pass it up!PROS:-Unique possession mechanic allows for great flexibility of playstyle each game-Updates address QoL wishes from player base. Awesome devs!-Good humor throughout game-Learning curve is perfect. Not really easy at all, not ""go **** yourself it's a rougelike"" hard-Encourages replayability by allowing you to pick an item from a previous playthrough and use it in a future game-Game design is... really good. Hard to explain, but the game GUI just FEELS well-made.-Easy to start up, save, and pick up later. Game doesn't seem super story-driven, so forgetting where you are isn't really an issue. This is a big pro to me as I often shuffle between 5-10 games and might not come back to something for a month or two.CONS:-Mediocre graphics (I don't care, but some might)-Sounds are repetitive-Inventory management is not excellent (but is slated to be improved in the next update)-Item diversity is a bit lacking-Maybe it's just me, but some forms just seem like trash, and some seem OP. I'm no expert, but there are definitely forms/skills that I just don't prioritize or use because they seem weak to me.-Not sure how I feel about stealth mechanic. Seems like best strategy is to get in there and slay bad guys - why would I want a form that can skip enemies and lose XP?"
