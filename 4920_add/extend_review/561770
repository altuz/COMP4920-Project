The puzzles are not difficult, it just takes some time to get all the achievements.A decent job ."

It could be much better.but this game was launched 3 months ago, and has still much game breaking bugs.That means this game is not even complete one - it's more like a beta test game.I even couldn't save the game, and some objects won't interact with - which is very annoying.ratings, 3 out of 10."
76561198353621505,Recommended,561770,31459329,Posted: 30 April,all,lvlexiegirl,I have been following this game during it's demo and really enjoyed it and the story concept it was going for.  When I found out that the full game was released I bought it immediately. It was really REALLY good. I love these types of games and this one was no exception! I've played through twice now and have gotten almost 3/4 of the achievements and I will be playing again to get the rest. I highly recommend giving this game a try! Wonderful!!
,Recommended,561770,31534684,Posted: 3 May,all,JamesFish21,A simple point and click adventure. The puzzles are a bit hard becaause of a lack of info but it is worth the price. Cant hurt to try given its price point.
,Recommended,561770,33607731,Posted: 17 July,all,EmFer,Dont fall into the bad reviews. This game have more potential than you may think. And it may have if it gets more improved.It's a good story. Some quite funny dialog. The sounds in the game were well explored.  7/10
76561198322470828,Recommended,561770,34944740,Posted: 14 September,all,KittyKatKuo,I didnt expect much from this game since its a bit crude visual wise but I did in fact enjoy this one. I love the characters and how your decisions make a huge difference in how the game will pan out! Some of the puzzles and such were a bit confusing though to me so it took me awhile and some help to figure ways to continue the story. I am glad I added this game to my library and can see myself playing over and over without growing bored. I did notice some things with the game such as the character seeing things that either werent there yet (mustve been ghost objects) or things the character already picked up.  I would highly recommend this one. It may look rough but its worth adding it to your library.

76561198043634620,Recommended,561770,35067478,Posted: 19 September,all,TinyRick,"Personally I'm on the fence about this game. It was a fun and enjoyable experience considering its cost. I do however feel that the game would drastically benefit from having some kind of ambient music patched in, seeing as pixel graphics in silence just fails to build any sort of tension, which at certain points in the game becomes dreadfully noticeable.There is also a really glaring hole in the plot depending on the choices you make.Towards the end of the narrative, you findDanDave, whom asks about the girl you meet in the diner; Now if like me you chose to tell her about your weird childish monsters, which seems harmless enough she hangs herself. Fair enough. BUT when you actually answer Dave you sayI ♥♥♥♥ing hanged her.This is important because the entire reason you meet the other main character-leading to the climax of the plot; is because you wanted to call the diner in order to find out ifthe girl you hanged is okay.So henceforth the plot doesn't make any damn sense.Apart from that though it's still an interesting narrative and has a diverse and interactive story based around your decisions, if you have a bit of time to waste and want to engage in a bit of a horror experience I would recommend this game."

Just Ignore Them."
,Not Recommended,561770,35234944,Posted: 26 September,all,bluespacedog,"Zero background music. It wouldn't be so much of a problem if there were at least SOUND EFFECTS, though. Like when the television turns on at first as a tiny jumpscare-type-event out of no where... Nothing. It's so ""huh."" and anticlimactic that when I recorded for my channel and went back to edit, I was incredibly tempted to add in a stock SFX of television static.I legitimately looked for music that I could add in the background because it was THAT boring and silent, minus the sound of the main character's footsteps. Which adds nothing.That was the biggest killer. How can you have a horror or dark game with zero ambiance..?It also doesn't help that some of the puzzles are convoluted as heck. The main ways I advanced at all was by random clicking and combining.Just... nah. I'm glad I bought it on sale.If you're gonna buy it, have a spooky playlist on queue and a really good imagination.Maybe it's secretly good, who knows. I couldn't stand this game more than an hour."

76561198072585625,Not Recommended,561770,33194366,Posted: 3 July,all,egglipse,"For a first game, it's not awful. You can find games that are under $5 CDN for less (or free) that are actually better made and better written, which must affect my review.Writing: The writing is poor in general. The grammar is incorrect in many instances, things are spelled wrong, and the sentences can be clunky and awkward.Plot: The story is very much a modern schlock horror - lots of violence, attractive male protagonist with dark past, attractive girl sidekick with dark past, and complicated lore. Feels like a mid-range NoSleep story. It's not incompetent, but I didn't personally find the story to be good - a matter of personal taste. I progressed past my own interest in the plot just for gameplay, but...Gameplay: The puzzles aren't organic and sometimes require a bit of a stretch to figure out. For instance, we know a character has a cell phone, but later she's scrambling for both a light and camera. Sometimes you'll complete puzzles easily, but have no idea why the solution was needed or how it would even work. Other times you'll be checking for interactive items and inadvertently find an event switch as a clickable pixel, when it should be hidden.Sound: I've read a lot about the soundtrack in reviews, but I found that there are long stretches without sound at all. For horror, sound is extremely important and more ambience would have greatly improved the atmosphere."

,Recommended,561770,35168780,Posted: 23 September,all,Splatbob1,"Ok, so, This is going to be my first, well, ACTUAL review... so... yeah!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!I have to admit, The way the game was laied out, felt weird, but in the end it worked. In the begining I thought it ended when the mom ""died"" and thought, 'thats it' that was short... But then realized there was more, like, 1 1/2 hours more. There are points in the story where you think that its all just BS and the writing feels really bad (like when you find out ""they are not monsters, they are robots"") But somehow it seems to be able to work out (like finding out the whole story of ""they're actualy dead people in robot suites"" it sounds bad when I say it....) But all in all, if you do a full play through... and get the ""Dad Ending"" which I got the first time... It is a really good game."
76561198134084776,Recommended,561770,31874906,Posted: 20 May,all,Coconut Head,"I had a lot of difficulty deciding if I should recomend this game or not. The intro was strong, and at the beginning I was genuinely intruiged by the story and wanted to find the answers to the questions, but after the first half hour or so, the flaws really started to show. The poor grammar and spelling are forgivable, maybe the creator doesn't speak english as a first language. But the characters are inconsistent and poorly written, the story has many holes and inconsistencies, with characters saying one thing but then is almost immediatly contradicted. I got the bad ending, but I don't really feel like putting in the effort to play again and make different choices which will supposedly give me the ""good"" ending. For the price, though, the intro alone is worth it."

The puzzles didn't feel finished. I loved the tutorial and one scary situation, even tho they did not make much sense. I do not feel the urge to replay and see what possibly could happen.Sometimes you just lack info about the riddles. I enjoy a challenge but not impossible ones.It's my first review and i just had to write one to get this out of my chest."

Nothing like graphic violence and nudity given pixelated form!  So much cheesiness!It's cheap as it is, but I'd still say to wait for it to go on sale before spending anything on it since it's only a few hours long.  One of my acheivements was also unable to be completed due to a bug, but after three play throughs to get all of them I'm pretty much done with this."
