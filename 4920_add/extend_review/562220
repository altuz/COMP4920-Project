,Recommended,562220,29580615,Posted: 29 January,all,Desolater IV,"A Physica Based Puzzle Gamehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STIjAmZypzs+ 229 Achievements that can be obtained in ~25mins+ The gameplay is pretty fun. The goal is to land the blue ball on the green platform. To do this you must explode the red blocks which will launch the yellow blocks away from the blast allowing the blue ball to reach the platform. Most levels have multiple red explosive blocks, so your job is to figure out which ones to explode and when.+ As a sequel the main difference between Zup! 1 and Zup! 2 is the blue ball. Since it rolls, you have to make sure it doesn't roll off the platform. Zup! 2 also seems to rely a lot more on chain reactions, and levels that require you to slingshot the ball across the level with very precisely timed explosions.+ Creatively designed levels which keeps the game feeling fresh and enjoyable from start to finish. (pretty surprising considering how simple the concept is)+ The game has the right balance of not being too difficult while still being a fair bit challenging. Some stages make the player think a fair bit in order to find the solution.- Sometimes the physics feels a bit ""random"" making a few stages reliant on luck which can be a bit irritating."

,Recommended,562220,28333083,"Posted: 12 December, 2016",all,ErickaUnlimited,"OverviewZup! is back with its second installment, ZUP! 2, a minimalistic puzzler that has you continuing the fun with exploding blocks, moving platforms and simplistically done physics all in hopes of sending your little blue circle home to unlock the next level. ZUP! 2 adds a few new mechanics and some slightly more difficult levels this time around, all while flooding your overlay with achievement after achievement for every action you take.With all the acclaim Steam users gave the previous installment, I wasn’t surprised to see a sequel to Zup!, but I was looking forward to some hopeful improvements to the game and some added longevity since, as anyone who has played the first game, knows it can be completed in well under an hour. While Zup! 2 adds a few additions to the level design and some time-based puzzles into the mix, the game itself can still be completed in under an hour.There’s not much new to Zup! 2 that seemed to change, which can be construed as a good thing and a bad thing. On the one hand, it is still an amusing game with modest puzzle designs and an entertaining concept, but on the other hand this would have been a great opportunity to really excel the brand forward into a provoking puzzler that captured a lot of what the previous title left out; in that regard, Zup! 2 fell short.However, the developers have certainly paid attention to the marketplace and know Steam’s audience, as the achievements you earn are completely geared towards profile design and showcase artwork, which shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who played the previous title. I even found myself conflicted on why I bought the game, undecidedly choosing and intermingling between fun and the desire for more options in my achievement showcase.It’s hard to say anything else about Zup! 2 without putting in superfluous information. If you liked the first title, you’ll enjoy this one, if you didn’t like it then you will likely be unimpressed by its successor. We’ll more than likely be graced with a third installment in the near future and I hope the developers take some time and really put some conscious effort into it; you can only ride the coattails of success for so long.ProsCasual, stress free fun.Great achievements for profile showcases.ConsIncredibly short.Little to no replayability.Only a handful of actually challenging levelsOverall, ZUP! 2 is more of the same; a basic, physics-based puzzle game that is fun, albeit short and unembellished with overly complex level design. Play if for the fun or the achievements, but for those looking for a real puzzling experience, you’ll find Zup! 2 doesn’t fit the mold."

The objective is the same as before: get the blue block to the green zone, except now the blue block is round, which opens up more level designs thanks to the extra movement made possible by the new shape.The amount of achievements (229) is even more absurd, nearly doubling the number in Zup!. As before, this is geared towards achievement hunters and profile decorators as there is a wider variety of symbols, with some Mandarin possible as well if so inclined.Besides the fundamental change in the shape of the blue block, gameplay is essentially unchanged. Some levels are slightly more challenging, but the game is on par with its predecessor in terms of difficulty, and should take the same amount of time to complete. There is also no replayability as there is little reason to revisit a level after clearing it.Overall Zup! 2 feels like an extension (or DLC) of Zup!, and like before, a big part of the game is getting the achievements to decorate profiles with. If that is worth something to you, then this game is worth considering. Zup! 3 is also in the works, and I hope something unique will be introduced this time because the novelty is wearing off."

I was like WTF there’s a second one??? They are gonna keep churning these games out, really?I will say, some of the levels seemed like more of a challenge than most of the first game, there is a lot more timing involved in the puzzles in this one. The first one had free DLC that I didn’t play cos I’d already uninstalled it, so maybe that was harder.There was one level that I actually cheated on on this. I still haven’t figured out how to do that level. The ball kept rolling off the edge of the platform  (it has to come to a complete stop on the green platform to finish the stage) but there’s a door that opens up that you click on to take you to the next stage, and it opened while the ball was still rolling, so without that oversight it woulda taken me a while longer.I’m curious, is there not a limit to the amount of achievements a game can have, the first Zup had 118 and this one has 229, is Zup 3 gonna have 449?. Can a game just give you say 10,000 achievements, doesn’t it defeat the purpose if you are handed them all on a plate just for clicking start or going into the menus lol. I don’t care really, but I thought there would be a limit that devs could put on their games.Let’s be honest here, these Zup devs have found an exploit in steam. I do like the achievements tho, it’s Christmas colour themed, gives you some nice new customization options for your achievement showcase. They even give you these Chinese? characters to use for some reason, these characters could be telling me to go f*ck my mother for all I know lol, but they are there if you want them."

,Recommended,562220,29468621,Posted: 24 January,all,JacquesLeSauve,"Everything I wrote in my review forZup!can pretty much be applied to Zup! 2 (length and all), with two exceptions. Firstly, the blue square of the previous game has been replaced with a rolling blue ball, making it far more movable and precarious. And secondly, the challenge and fiendishness has been ramped up quite a bit this time around. And I couldn't be happier with it.They could have very easily just extended the model of the first game and given us more of the same, but I really appreciate how some serious thought appears to have gone into the layout of the stages as they've constructed some really clever puzzles. They're still all relatively easy to get through, but are way more fun this time around and more often than not they put a huge smile on my face.It's stupid just how satisfying it is to launch the ball up into the air then nail the timing perfectly to hit it with another block and send it flying onto the target first go, or to send it hopping from one explosion to the next whilst dodging moving obstacles and still getting it home safe. That alone is almost worth the price of admission.While I still don't feel the need to run out into the street, grab the nearest stranger I see by the collar and yell at them to get this game as soon as they can, it's still an absolutely rock solid title that comes easily recommended and that I'd happily play more of."

If you are a Steam achievement hunter, this game is great for that as the game can be completed in one gaming session fairly easily. If you are someone who likes to customize your Steam profile, this is also perfect due to the fact you receive multiple achievement for every level completed. This is done by sorting the levels in A, B, C and so on. For example, once you complete level A, you unlock the letter A achievement in various colors. You can then display these achievements on your Steam profile using the ""Achievement Showcase"" showcase, spelling out what ever you choose within 7 achievement slots."

Why? Because it's pure fun for the half hour it'll take you to finish the game. InZup!You need to get a blue cube to a green platform. You accomplish this by clicking on one or more red cubes that explode and send the blue and yellow cubes flying in the air. Sometimes a sequence of a few timed jumps is needed to get the blue cube to its target, but it's never a frustrating experience. It's just giggly fun. The game makes use of the Steam Achievements to add some more giggles by throwing an achievement your way for about anything you do in the game. You will easily get 118/118 achievements in half an hour. Seriously, if you want a cheap half hour of pure innocent fun, pick upZup!when it's on sale.But as forZup!2, I have to say no. The only difference is that the blue cube has become a ball, which makes for slightly more interesting physics. But they have taken the achievements joke a bit too far inZup!2: you simply get 3 achievements for anything you do. In the first game, you get an achievement for starting a level and for ending a level -haha- but in the second game you get three achievements for each level and for each and every action that's connected to the Steam Achievements.Note that there is aZup!3which has over 1000 achievements!Zup!2is already taking it too far, soZup!3is nothing less than over the top. It's only for people who want to artificially increase their number of completed Steam Achievements, but not for anyone else.My advice: get the first Zup!-game and give the others a miss."

The puzzles are relatively straightforward and well designed. Some may catch you out a little here and there but for the most part they're not very tasking and you can complete any of the games in under an hour.This game did exactly what I wanted (gave me lots of cool achievements to decorate with) and wasn't a chore to play so would recommned highly to gamers with similar intentions. If you're actually looking for a challenging puzzle game however then there are probably better ones on the market.

It provides massive freedom rights to the player by letting him actually choose what to do in a way that no game has ever done it before.Think about how dictators and globalists try to take away your freedom by applying censorship, terrible AAA-graphics, massive marketing on every social media and similar diabolic devices like video games and you have an actual right to feel bad and enslaved. Then one brave developer comes along, drops this gem of a puzzle-based action-adventure-platform-shooter onto you and you feel the power of the people in your back.The goal is easy: The ball has to land on the designated ground. Only when that happens and only when you - the funny and smart player that enjoys the freedom of the constitution - make use of your massive powers to accomplish it, then you are able to win.The symbolism is clear: The ball is your freedom, your power to vote, your right to speak the truth and make your opinion heard, the explosions you cause by clicking on the globalistic, satanic red boxes is the power of the dictators crumbling under the power of your mouse cursor, that is obviously the power of the people, the pure essence of freedom and liberty that causes the cascade of events leading to your freedom being able to land on safe ground. Once you manage to liberate one level, the gate opens to the next big project, the next mission, the next dictator that needs to be crushed under your might.You can believe me, I studied this game. Hundreds of hours of game time, dozens of essays, two books and a radio show that I developed solely to make the spirit of this game, the essence of freedom that this game represents and the shining sanctity that is the developer needs to be witnessed by more people.Join the resistance, join the force of freedom and show your love of liberty and play this game.God bless America."

The concept is simple and the levels are fun enough. The main challanges are clicking on the right blocks and timing. Some of the levels feel cheap because of the first reason as the way to solve the level is to click on the right one of the 4 blocks. There was potential to make the levels more challenging because the ball keeps its momentum so it can roll off but only a few levels take actual advantage of that fact. You'll beat the game in 20 minutes so it's probably worth a dollar but I feel like the concept could have gone a lot further.There are a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of achievements for not really a good reason and it seems super gimmicky and stupid really.¯\_(ツ)_/¯

,Recommended,562220,29330344,Posted: 17 January,all,Sinful Sorcerer,"This is what I had to say about the first Zup! game:""To be enirely honest, I went into this with very low expectations. This was mostly due to my prior experiences with Super Duper Flying Genocide 2017, another recent title that markets itself in a similar fashion. ""Short, Simple, Earn loads of achievements"". And I'd be lying if I said this game is perfect, but I have to give praise where praise is due. This game really surprised me!The very first distinction I'd like to make between this and Super Duper Flying Genocide 2017 is that unlike that dissappointment, I would actually consider this a game and a rather enjoyable and intuitive one at that! It is clear that Zup! goes for the same demographic; achievement hunters, completionists, whatever you want to call them. I consider myself part of that group, so I felt inclined to give this game a try despite my rather low expectations. Very much like the building blocks that you interact with in Zup! my expectations were blown away! This is definitely a puzzle game first and foremost, and an achievement treasure second.Your objective is to bring the blue square onto the green tiles through the use of explosions. The red squares are explosive and clicking them will make them blow up, knocking any yellow and blue squares away in the process. It really is as simple as that. But just because the mechanics are simple it doesn't necessarely mean that the game itself is easy, in fact I'd say far from it.The levels start out easy enough, and for the first few levels it feels like this might have actually been a bad choice after all, just another cash grab copy paste job with loads of achievements attached, but then you reach level 10 and things start to get interesting. As you progress through the game each level becomes more and more challenging and you need to both think of the right solution and make use of your reflexes and predictions to launch the blue square with the right trajectory and force to get it where it needs to be.Soon I had forgotten about my prior pessimism and was instead joyfully exploring in how many ways I could try to knock the yellow block-towers down and with what sort of speed I could send the blue square flying in order to solve the puzzle in front of me. The simple yet addictive nature of the game had caught me entirely off guard and I was getting more and more intrigued and hopeful for the next challenge the game would provide me with...And then it ended. Just like that.If anything, that would be my only real gripe with the title, it is extremely short. I beat the whole thing with 100% achivements in only a couple of minutes, and I wish it would go on for a bit longer as I was actually having quite a bit of fun with it. But to be fair the game has a very low price point and the tags do describe it as ""short"" so I should have been expecting it to end rather quickly.All that said, I hope you understand my thoughts about this game but in case I was too lengthy in my description of it and the enjoyment it gave me let me try to sum it up in a few short words:This is a short but fun and intuitive physics puzzle game. I had a lot of fun with it and the achievements are a bonus rather than the main focus. I recommend this highly if you want some quick fun, and I suggest you pick up the Zup-Zup! Bundle which hosts all three games for a very affordable price. I have not yet played the other two titles, but if they are anywhere as good as this then I cannot recommend it enough.""And well, I am happy to say that after playing Zup! 2 I can confirm that this is a worthy sequel! More levels, more achievements, more Zup!Enjoy!"

The goal is to land the blue ball on the green platform. To do this you must explode the red blocks which will launch the yellow blocks away from the blast allowing the blue ball to reach the platform. Most levels have multiple red explosive blocks, so your job is to figure out which ones to explode and when.+ As a sequel the main difference between Zup! 1 and Zup! 2 is the blue ball. Since it rolls, you have to make sure it doesn't roll off the platform. Zup! 2 also seems to rely a lot more on chain reactions, and levels that require you to slingshot the ball across the level with very precisely timed explosions.+ Creatively designed levels which keeps the game feeling fresh and enjoyable from start to finish. (pretty surprising considering how simple the concept is)+ The game has the right balance of not being too difficult while still being a fair bit challenging. Some stages make the player think a fair bit in order to find the solution.- Sometimes the physics feels a bit ""random"" making a few stages reliant on luck which can be a bit irritating."

,Recommended,562220,28873648,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,DKatana,"Zup! 2 builds on the groundwork of the first title by increasing the elements of timing and reflexes in the puzzles. The one major change to the dynamics is that the blue square is now a blue ball with rolling physics. This both increases and decreases the difficulty of levels, depending on the kind of puzzle presented: the fact the ball can roll means you've more leeway for momentum-sensitive levels, while its rolling increases the need for good timing in the sequence explosion based levels.For this it is an improvement on the first title. If the upcoming third Zup! builds still further on the abundant potential of the concept, then the series could be a classic Achievement in the making. ;)One idea for a future Zup! would be a level creator and/or Steam modding support. Thus the Zup! community could create  and upload ingenious levels, giving the game a whole new element and increasing its durability beyond the sub-1 hour mark."

Therefore, I will be literally copy/pasting this across all of my reviews.Many people call these games out, citing that they're card farming games. While this may or may not be true, these games have some very good puzzles. Sure, they're short, but I feel that the price I paid for them is well worth it (Less than a dollar for each game in the summer sale?!). Some of the puzzles are really well thought out and it feels good to complete a game like this. So here's the pros and cons.Pros:-Good music, never found myself reaching for the mute button. The music IS on a loop, but it's comparable to Hexcells' music, so if you enjoyed that game's music, you'll enjoy their music as well.-Well designed puzzles, especially in 4 and Zero.Could be a pro or a con:-A ton of achievements. If you don't want to artificially inflate your achievement count, don't play any of these passed 1 and 2. If you don't care or you in fact do want to do that, go ahead and play all of them-Feels like one of those games you would love to play on Flash sites like Newgrounds or KongregateCons:-Short, but enjoyable. You could actually ♥♥♥♥ the dev(s?) out of money by getting 100% achievements in less than the 2 hour refund periodOverall, I enjoyed these games enough to recommend them all."

Click red squares to make them explode which push around the yellow blocks to interact with the blue ball.Early levels are simple and far too easy but it gets a little more difficult later on such as having to time explosions to make the yellow squares hit the ball mid air to make it go to where you need to go.It's a simple game with apparently 200 achievements?Minimalistic in design plus basic gameplay means it is just a little too dull for me.Do I recommend? ehhh... *wiggles hand horizontally* I'd say maybe, if you like basic puzzle games and a bucket load of achievements. But I base my recommendations on whether or not I enjoyed the game, which I did not...So it's a No."

It feels like such a waste of time when it's all a super simple ""puzzle"", when suddenly it adds a level where everything is just based on when you knock the ball out of the air with a flying cube and you have to restart until you get it.TL;DR, Trial and error.

It's sad that it has almost no replayability at all, you'd have to wait a few years to forget the puzzles and then play it again. But other than that, this is an outstanding game. Not to mention that it's extremely cheap! I got it with a 75% discount!I'll have to try the others as well."

,Recommended,562220,30290177,Posted: 2 March,all,"RandomHobo, Inc.","A big improvement over the first game.Zup! 2 uses a circle piece instead of the box in Zup! 1, and takes full advantage of the circle's rolling mechanics to create relativity interesting and challanging levels. Zup! 2 is much more satisfing than the first game, as it actually has alot of real puzzles, even though some are repeated several times with minor variations.Even so, a lot of the levels still require a process of elimination to figure out which red box completes the level. In addition, some levels require precise thiming that makes them frustrating. This game still has a lot of the problems that I mentioned in my review of Zup! 1, but makes up for these flaws a little with better level design.Considering the low price, I recommend this gameOverall:5.5/10"

Yes, why not. It's only 15 MB, and something like half a dollar?Edit: I decided buying this game after beating Oik and seeing it compared to this game.I'm now playing Zup! 3 and I realized .zup has nothing to do with Oik, they're completely different.Ignore my comment before this edit, as I was hoping to taste chocolate cake as I hade a bite off grilled salmon.Zup! is a good game just like Oik."

Now letting the game run in the background just so I can get my other 2 card drops.  LOL!  Is it worth your money?  Sure, if it's on sale, or if you really need those achievements.  Otherwise, get something like Geometry Dash if you want something you can play for months as oppoesed to an hour or 2."
