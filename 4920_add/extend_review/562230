,Recommended,562230,34327976,Posted: 18 August,all,Mysterio,"Here are my thoughts on the game after a forum member asked if he should use his 33% Steam coupon discount on it.  After re-reading what I wrote, I thought it would make a decent Steam review.  So here you go!I think it’s great fun and would have jumped on it with a 33% discount without hesitation. I jumped in at the 10% EA launch discount and have no regrets. And if you use a 16:10 monitor, they just added support for that ratio yesterday. At first experience, the tactical battles may seem simplistic and without much player involvement, but once you understand what’s happening, you really need to spend your energy wisely.On the campaign map, you’re the tyrant fighting to dominate the galaxy, but are opposed by the Galactic Senate, which is trying to control the three sectors. If they manage to control any one sector with four ships, you lose. Completing missions in a sector will beat their ships back.I’m about four missions into my first campaign and have seen a nice variety of cards, planet types, events, and abilities. You, as the tyrant, can equip three pieces of equipment (which are unlocked as rewards for completing a mission) that give you benefits during a mission. Other mission rewards include unlocking more powerful cards for your faction’s deck and Empire rewards (such as more powerful ships). After each successful mission, you choose one of two perks, whose benefits persist throughout the campaign. Each mission is rated between 1-5 stars; the more stars, the more difficult the mission. Each also has 1-2 goals, and some even have quirks, like poorer cities (planets), tech planets with greater tech income, more asteroids, etc.After choosing your mission and outfitting yourself, a sector is generated, populated by random planets controlled by no one, neutral forces, or the Galactic Senate. You have to use your fleets to conquer the planets. But the Galactic Senate is also tossing its support to the planets, changing them from neutral (gray) planets to GS (red) planets. Neutral fleets won’t move to other planets to attack your fleets and planets, but GS ones will! You also have to contend with the occasional rebellions.After you conquer a planet (by reducing its defense to zero via rolling “d6s”), a multiple-choice event may trigger. Some of the choices may be locked; you need a specific unidentified trait to unlock them. These traits are sometimes gained by choices you make during events. So you’ll acquire traits like Hitman, Diplomat, Scientist, etc, each of which has multiple ranks and all of which persist throughout the campaign. The outcome of your choice will be positive, negative, or nothing. Also, each planet may or may not have a power, like a cannon that can fire on enemy fleets within range or mercs that will add an additional die to your next invasion roll.Toss in your hand of cards and a tyranny meter (which powers your Death Ray!), and you have a lot of options available to you. And I haven’t even discussed the tactical battles in detail! I really hope the game takes off, because it really strikes me as a labor of love."

,Recommended,562230,35355528,Posted: 30 September,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"I'm not a 4X genre kind of guy. I've tried.In factStellariswas my final attempt at breaking into the genre. This was my finalfinalattempt.Now, I do likeSpace Tyrantquite a bit, but it does suffer from some of the same issues that other 4X games have. The saving grace is that it simplifies things and distills mechanics down to something more digestible.It's for this exact reason that I would guess traditional 4X people probably won't trade inCivorStellarisfor this title.I think a staple of the 4X genre is having a complicated and breathy system.Anyways,Space Tyrantis fairly easy to learn and has some great humor. Yeah, the RNG is wily, but it's also wily in those other 4X games BUT the RNG is just hidden better. You know I'm right about that.At some point this title was described as a coffee-break game, but I disagree. Yes, it is easily played with one hand, but matches are certainly more than about 20 minutes. They are shorter than competitor titles, but still. The other point of concern is the roguelike nature and permadeath. That part makes me nervous, but the jury is still out on that. The permadeath spans over an entire CAMPAIGN that will easily take you, oh, probably 5-10 hours to complete. One false step and it's back to the begining. I'm not sure it works here, but again, I still need to play more.Pros:+You can't even tell this is Early Access.+Controls are intuitive and there is a solid tutorial system to ease you in.+It definitely has that one-more-round addiction going on.+They nicely distilled what I would consider an overly complicated system that 4X games adhere to into a bite-size package.Cons:-While the music is good, it is very repetitive. There isn't enough variation.-RNG is fairly brutal, but more importantly - everything hinges on this idea of permadeath and I'm just not sure it makes it more 'fun'. I'm still thinking on this.-Alot of the dialogue is quite humorous but I find myself skipping through to see the end result. Again, the RNG leaves something to be desired. Choices don't feel meaningful. It's like just pick a button and see what happens most of the time.Slayaway Campwas a hit and this is no exception.If the idea appeals to you, by all means go for it."

The game runs stable, I've encountered minor bugs that are completly forgivable. It features 3 playable races, 2 of which are locked and after 12 hours, I still haven't unlocked them. It's perfectly playable, runs like a complete release, Content is sufficient, but can be expaned upon, more races, events, cards, ships, etc.It's game of the year material for me.

76561198048910194,Recommended,562230,34963139,Posted: 14 September,all,retrox,"With its store front claim of delivering a ""fast-paced roguelike-lite 5X"" experience, chunky UI, and colorful cartoonish graphics, Space Tyrant may at first glance seem like just another one of those hyper-casual mobile games that we're seeing more and more of on Steam these days; but beneath the veneer lies a brilliantly conceived game that, despite lacking the depth of many 4X games that fans of the genre celebrate, delivers an entertaining experience that can be just as satisfying.I've always had a soft spot for games that let me be the bad guy. Space Tyrant endeavors to join the ranks of titles like Dungeon Keeper, Evil Genius, and Overlord by casting the player in the role of the ultimate... well... Space Tyrant. You'll find no diplomatic standing screen here. There will be no trade routes. You will not be tweaking your economy (unless brutally oppressing your hapless citizens to increase their productivity counts as ""tweaking""). You will foster no alliances, shaky or otherwise. There will be no negotiation. The galaxy will either submit to your will, or you will destroy it with your lasers and missiles. Or maybe you'll be the one who gets destroyed by lasers and missiles. Actually, that's probably what will happen.The premise was immediately enticing to me, but even though my curators were recommending it and all of the other internet buzz surrounding the game was positive, I held back. The reason was simple: ""Fast-paced"" and ""4X"" are mutually exclusive terms in my world. I like my 4X games with layers upon layers of depth. I enjoy being able to wrest control of the universe from my enemies using strength, wit, and guile (along with a healthy dose of economic min-maxing). My current all-time favorite of the genre is Distant Worlds, and I've long since decided that if a 4X game can't deliver that sort of deep experience, then I simply don't have time for it.Thankfully, after having been practically browbeaten by my peers into buying the game, I discovered that Space Tyrant is far more than it seems on the surface. A campaign plays out almost like a series of board games, if board games could be randomly generated. I won't get into the mechanical specifics of the game, as so many other reviews have already covered that; suffice it to say that despite the seemingly simple premise of ""just blow everything up to win,"" there are tons of strategic and tactical options available to the player over the course of a campaign. Will you prioritize conquering crystal worlds in order to utilize your most powerful cards? Or will you favor wealthy worlds in the early game to quickly bolster your fleets? Or perhaps you will focus on tech worlds, so that even your most meager fleet will be able to deal with hordes of ill-equipped enemies.You will need to do all three to succeed, but how you choose to prioritize objectives based on enemy movement, playfield layout, and other RNG factors will make or break you. Yes, you can play this game quick and dirty; but if you're not paying attention, the Galactic Senate will end you. Or the RNG. Or the space sharks. Yeah, there are space sharks. With lasers on their heads. Because why wouldn't a space shark have a laser on its head?So in closing, if you're like me and find yourself hesitant to try this game based on any sort of 4X bias, just stop it. Stop being a 4X elitist. You should be ashamed. I know I am.This game is not even finished yet, and it's already awesome. Buy it and play it already. Keep your Stellaris wiki open in the background if it helps keep you sane, just play this game."

Space Tyrant is hilarious, so many funny moments as you, the bad guy, blast your way from one planet to the next expanding your empire. Much faster paced and fun than typcial 4x games most people are used to.  They definitely have a good sense of humor about so much of the gameplay and interface.  At first you might think its easy but there's more strategy and thought required to actually get beyond the initial phases and kick some butt.Also the graphics, the bunny rabbit dictators and rastafarian looking warlords just crack me up.Thankfully too this is not a buggy mess Early Access.

76561197965073406,Recommended,562230,33877735,Posted: 29 July,all,Sheap,"It's fun!A lightweight 4X game that covers the biggest flaws in the 4X genre with elements borrowed from roguelikes.  It neatly dodges the two biggest complaints about 4X games: 1) the AI is bad and 2) the game bogs down in micromanagement.The AI... well, sure, the AI isn't really competent.  But that's OK!  Victory is not about beating the AI, it's about accomplishing your goals before something goes wrong.  Victory is more like a rogue-lite, where you race against time.  The unrest meter slowly ticking away, planets rebelling, the Senate fleet growing, all these things build up until you just can't go on.  The AI is mostly there to stick a finger in your eye at the worst possible time: Your fleet is finally in position to attack the Senate capital, but suddenly a planet rebels, joins the Senate and puts your homeworld under siege.  Although the difficulty isn't fiendish - at least in the early levels - It is totally possible to lose this game if you're careless or unlucky.  Later on it gets quite a bit harder.  And watch out for the space monsters.And there's no bogging down, either.  The game plays fast.  The traditional ""next turn"" button conveniently changes to point you at the next thing you need to deal with, and just about the time when you'd start snowballing to a victory in most 4X games, the game declares the scenario won for you.  The worst thing that can happen is some fleet of yours flies off to a random dead-end world... but even a dead-end fleet in the empire's backwater can be used to boost your economics in a pinch.There's a side mechanic of card playing, where the cards give you special abilities or new ships - similar to the old game Star Chamber (if anyone remembers that), except you earn cards through accomplishing goals rather than paying money.  There's no real deck building mechanic, and the cards are really a footnote rather than central to the game like in Star Chamber.  The cards are situationally useful, from useless to totally overwhelming and anywhere in between, depending on the luck of the draw and what happens to be on the map.  But they add variety to a game that might otherwise become routine.Though the game is in early access, it's pretty stable and bugs are few.This is likely to always be a niche game, but it fills that niche well.  Play it on your lunch break, just be sure to set an alarm because you can end up spending three or four hours before you know it."
,Recommended,562230,34517752,Posted: 26 August,all,VaultBoy,"Very-fun 4x game. This game doesn't have the strategic depth of the Galactic Civilization nor Master of Orion series, but it's a fun, streamlined experience.The tactical combat is fun and usually quick.. Ships are aligned opposite each other and the player can activate special abilities as a power meter charges up. The different ships have a mix of strengths and weaknesses. The perks you take during the campaign can also reinforce strengths of certain ships. This provides a pretty good variety for repeat plays. However, towards the end of the campaign, you'll usually have locked in on a specific strategy and the combat starts to feel a little repetative.The two alien species current available for campaign play different and have different perks. The Hoplite have much stronger ships that in my playthough could be upgraded to dish out a lot of damage very quickly. The Bzzerk were more economy focussed with weaker ships and a weaker seige die. Once their ships were upgraded, they were much better at holding their own in a fight.The rogue-lite elements are interesting. Each play of a campaign progresses more and more towards unlocks. It would be nice both the unlocks and the requirements to unlock were known prior to ending a campaign (win or lose). The downside of this is that in my two campaign plays, I didn't get to build the higher-tier ships. These ships are unlocks, but they don't appear to unlock until after a campaign. Considering I beat both campaigns, I don't have a lot of incentive to replay.There's a card system that allows you to generate a quick boost or ability. The cards have a crystal cost, and crystal planets provide the resource to play them. It's a neat little system and makes this feel a bit more like a board game. As you play, more cards will be unlocked giving you access to better abilities. The commanders, which you'll pick one at the start of a mission, also have per mission card unlocks. In general, these commander cards give a good incentive to push for specific goals. One thing I didn't like was the unlocks based on losing in combat. This seems counter-intuitive, and I'd rather see it be X ships lost in combat.The variety of mission structure keeps things changed up. Some missions are about taking over a percentage of the galaxy, others are about accumulating wealth, playing so many cards, accruing a set number of crystals, or controlling 2 of 3 points on the map. SInce the missions break up what you're going for, it keeps the strategic layer of the game interesting.Even though the game is early access (EA), this feels like a complete game for the price. The bugs are minor and seldom occur. The main bug I ran into was strategic layer would occassionally stop recognizing mouse clicks, but it was resolved by exiting back to the main menu and going back into the game.One minor quibble is that you can only have a single campaign going. This is like an EA issue, since they're focussed on the gameplay rather than setting it up to allow multiple save files.Overall, this is a very fun 4x game. In it's current state, I have about 20 hours of gameplay in. That was 20 hours to beat both campaigns, with a third campaign still in development. I think anyone that enjoys this game will easily get around 30 hours gameplay out of it. If you love the game, then there's certainly replayability to add more."

I found myself wishing there were more of this sort of simplified, lighthearted 4X game.I'll leave the list of things it does right to all the other good reviews, and just talk about its problems.First, the difficulty of missions is extremely uneven.  The devs seem to leave to much control over missions to the RNG that you could be immediately set upon by a legitimately impossible confluence of events, or encounter zero drama from turn 1.There are several different mission types, and in my experience, only one (in which you must capture and hold 2 of 3 specific planets) is consistently tense.  The others are always effectively decided within the first few turns - either the game throws everything at you as quickly as possible, or it doesn't.  If it doesn't, the entire mission is dead easy.It also has a problematic meta-strategy layer wth the senate control mechanic in the mission selector.  My first ragequit happened when I won the last of the initial 12 missions you have to win before taking on the senate.  Upon winning it, the senate promptly sent two ships to the same area that already had 2 ships in it.  4 ships in one area, even for a moment, and the campaign is over.I WON the last mission, kept more than 2 senate ships from ever being in the same area at any time for the entire campaign until the literal moment I won the last mission, and was greeted with the ""game over"" screen.  I've rarely been so mad at a video game.With a few tweaks to smooth out the difficulty and fix a few ""we've decided you lose now"" problem mechanics, it'll be great.  Even with its frustrations, I still can't bring myself to give it a thumbs down, though.  Thumbs up, but I'm done playing until it impoves some things."

But this is a solid and fun project, put together with skill and professionalism. Its Early Access done right and worthy of mention.As other reviewers have said, the concept of Space Tyrant is ""lunch-break strategy"". But while true, sticking to that description is a disservice to the game. There’s definitely more to it than that. It’s engrossing and it’s easy to spend several ""lunch-breaks"" back-to-back trying to master it.Space Tyrant is surprisingly deep and full featured – especially for an EA title. It’s not especially hard, but the learning curve is a little steep. Once the game mechanics are understood however, things become easier. But, in proper roguish fashion, it will throw villainies and surprises your way. You can expect to restart your runs a few times.Then again, why wouldn’t you want to? Space Tyrant is plain fun. The humor is fitting and smart, the mechanics work, the flow of the game is effective – it has both style and substance. Where too many games fall back to the same bland designs, Space Tyrant is unafraid to be its own thing. And it works pretty darn well."

Definitely worth a try, especially if you're into 4x, and even more especially if you're busy and want something that plays quickly.The graphics are cute and really pop.  The exploration is deep, but simple.  The rpg elements that carry over missions in the campagin really enrich the experience, and the tech is also very simple, but interesting.The music was a special surprise as being quirky and fun and original, and the overall ""tyrant"" theme is refreshing.  I love a 4x/sim type of game that encourages you to be a bad guy, muahahaha!"

If you are fan of strategic, turn based games with a space theme and a little strategic click action during battles, then this is a game I recommend for you. It was worth the $20 already. Be prepared to lose the first couple campaigns as there is a learning curve to the game and the unlocks come either by fulfilling certain goals or, more likely so, doing a certain gold mission in a campaign."

It brings me great happiness. Also, I like playing this game.Space Tyrant plays like a 4X with all the fiddly bits broken off. I like some fiddly bits as a general principal (I have like 8000 hours in EU, which is basically just a pile of bits that fiddle), but sometimes I don't want to play a game with so many levers. Space Tyrant is the same flavor as other strategy games, but I enjoy playing it when my brain is tired.I think you should probably buy it."

,Recommended,562230,34305879,Posted: 17 August,all,Des,"Very well made and fun game! Production quality on par with best titles in the genre. severely addictive!This game has one major drawback: make one mistake and you will have to restart the whole campaign. HOURS of building your empire. Lose one mission and you're back to square one.Since the maps appear to be randomly generated, the odds are substantial that in the course of the 3-4 games towards the end of the campaign you'll end up in a bad starting position. Since the enemy likes to bring doomstacks, fail one battle and the whole mission goes to bust. Fail one mission and your 6-hour campaign goes down the drain. There are no saves, no second chances. Pair that with many core mechanics being seemingly very random and you're up for a lot of frustration.One smaller issue I've had is replayability: almost everything which would bring variety is locked and unlocking ANYTHING  takes many missions. You'll find yourself playing with the same stuff a lot - I guess this might dissuade the less grind-oriented playersOverall: great ideas, excellent execution, 4+/5"
76561198000848440,Not Recommended,562230,33965559,Posted: 2 August,all,Old Man Jenkins,"At first it had promise. I liked the overall look and feel. And it had a great amount of charm to it. But after having to restart from the very beginning for the THIRD time, I can't recommend it. I don't mind RNG in games, but it seems like every time you need a two or more to take a planet you'll get a one instead. When the AI invades? It's always on the upper end of the rolls. Sure, I've seen them roll a two or a three every now and then. But more often than not they'll roll a five or six and take a planet in one go, while your fleet is going for it's third attack on a planet that only had a value of four defence. And God help you if you get the wormhole event. You might get lucky and it'll send your fleet only a planet or two away. Or more likely it'll send your main fleet to the other end of the galaxy.Then there's restarting from the beginning if you fail a mission. Now from what the game says you can unlock other commanders as a kind of ""extra life"" system. I didn't make it that far, as whenever I'd get to the mission where the next commander is the reward, either I'd fail due to the enemy fleets outnumbering mine by a mile and overrunning me. Or I'd immediately hit the wormhole event and watch as my only fleet hit the other side of the galaxy. I don't mind difficulty, but this is just frustrating as all hell.I don't normally write reviews. Maybe it's the Gamer Rage still burning in me after watching my third attempt go up in smoke due to Space Sharks holing up in the center of the map and destroying my fleets while letting the Senate's move unopposed. It does have some promise and charm to it. But currently? Pass. Unless you really like frustration. Then I suppose you might find it worth it."
76561198030576699,Not Recommended,562230,33871750,Posted: 28 July,all,whytew0lf,"TL:DR  - Needs a large amount of balancing of the RNG elements.For a 4X stripped down, there's no allowance for tactics or strategy to take place.Invasions - Invasion dice needs to be balanced, IE: 1,2,3,3,4,5 and not 1,2,2,3,4,5 leaving players screwed for 4-5 turns on early turns. At least give them a chance to grow.Possibility for commander level to modify Invasion dice - Sure, I have a huge fleet and a very experienced commander, still spending 4-5 turns knocking over a planet because of poor RNG. (Idea - Every 2 commander levels adds 1 to the Invasion die result, rounded down).Space Monsters - The gorram Space Slug, not the Shark, the Shark is fine and eats all comers.Just the Space Slug.. which arbitrarily attacks the player's fleets, and ONLY the player's fleets every 2nd turn if you're in range of the Slug's ""home"" tile.. for early access this is ridiculous. The Slug needs to be balanced so that it either goes after all fleets or moves on every 3rd or 4th turn instead of every other turn.Possible other Slug fix - Space Slug only regens when in combat, not out of combat. If the thing is going to come and eat your Rank 3 commander and his full fleet every time you're in the area because the Senate is running missions against you from Slug Land, he needs to be able to be dealt with, or this game is just another RNG time sink and not actually 4X.So maybe your Neutral Monsters disrupt missions if they visit a planet with an active mission, and lacking a fleet to move towards, head towards the planet because of all the noise?Commanders - Have unlocked Greenfoot, and he's terrible compared to Stonehair. Meteor Shower is a powerful ability which scales well and always delivers when you use it.The bramble patch doesn't seem to do enough, yet scales up in cost? How about adding a damage reflect element to the higher levels of the shield?Redeye, being a berserk inducer from what I've seen, seems to be a good strong Commander at any stage, particularly for the bunnies once they've unlocked Regen field on the Cruisers.Customisation of the player Tyranny deck?Unlocking cards is nice and all.. and I expect this wouldn't happen until an expansion, but how about allowing some customising of the deck you use? In a galaxy map with reduced crystals or erratic ones, it would be nice and strategic if I could strip out the 4 cost Battleship recruitment, or the 5 cost HMS Immaculate Dreadnought, because I just want to play a bunch of low cost cards and not worry about Crystal worlds?Derelict Worlds - Speaking of Crystals and how the inability to customise your deck can make those useless (more RNG is NOT a BETTER GAME even in pseudo-4X land), why not have an inactive Cannon World be able to be powered by a Crystal for one turn? It's got limited range, and once the area is pacified it loses all value, but currently takes an entire artifact slot to use the Cannon.This is a lovely double edged tactical sword, becuase it gives the AI something to use crystal worlds for/with.Don't buy this yet, needs more work on balance so that RNG doesn't ruin your campaign when you're 5-6 battles in and force a restart."

Maybe because there's probably no such thing as a quick 4x because that will miss any depth and planning just like this game. It's a nice idea, and funny at times but not for long.If you don't mind a lack of depth, try it. But otherwise ""real"" 4X games like Stellaris are much better."
