,Not Recommended,562320,28230151,"Posted: 6 December, 2016",all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","Locked in VR isn't awful, but as much as I love escape games it's hard to really give it a glowing recommendation. The better escape games are full of things for you to move around and explore, but the enviroment in this game is mostly plastic, with a majority of the objects in the room being a part of the scenery that can't be touched. It makes it difficult to tell what you're actually supposed to grab, and what's just clutter that you shouldn't bother trying to reach. It's interesting that this game actually gives you a time limit of one hour like real escape rooms, but the time limit just ends up being frustrating for the wrong reasons because some of the puzzles are so poorly implemented that you'll end up spending way too long trying to get them to work and run out of time and have to start over.The flashlight in the game operates on batteries for some strange reason, and there are a limited amount of extra batteries in the room, but the flashlight doesn't tell you that and the batteries don't look anything like batteries so there's a high chance that you'll end up just stumbling in the dark half of the room trying to use your crowbar on the extremely finnicky and poorly implemented board puzzle that isn't even very easy to do when you can see it because of the weird delay between your hands' movement and the in-game hands. Since you have to hold the flashlight a significant amount of the time, but you can't teleport if both of your hands are full, you end up having to pick things up and toss them a few feet over and over until you reach the other side of the room you're trying to get to, hoping that the item doesn't get stuck somewhere along the way. And finally, one of the puzzles just doesn't seem to work at the moment, so I still haven't completely finished the game. The voice acting is also somewhat poor, and as much as I feel bad for faulting someone for their accent I really couldn't tell what the character was saying about half the time between the accent and the low volume, so I have no idea if he was giving hints or just commenting about the weather. Locked in VR has a pretty decent atmosphere,  but there are just too many problems with it for me to actively recommend it. I'd only try it out if you've played the other better titles available."

Amazing atmosphere.That being said, I haven't completed the game yet because of a few issues, I hope the developer can address them in future updates. Off the top of my head (most important first):- I got a game-breaking bug where one of my hands started floating away constantly towards the ground. This was not due to tracking issues - I suspect gravity got enabled for the hand object.- The flashlight runs out way too quickly. Is there any way to recharge it? It runs out after like 5 minutes and it's impossible to finish the game in the dark. (Edit: apparently there's batteries, but I still couldn't find them. Maybe make them glow in the dark slightly?)- The graphics are really great, but pretty blurry. I'd love a supersampling option in-game.- It gets tiring pressing the trigger button to hold the flashlight at all times. Maybe it should ""pop"" in place when you press the trigger once, then to drop it press the trigger again.- The grabbing mechanic is hit-and-miss.Most of these are minor issues though, and I guarantee you'll have a lot of fun with this game."

,Recommended,562320,28660632,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Baphomet,"Locked in VR is another “Escape the Room” style game where you wake up in a situation akin to a Saw movie and must solve a series of challenges to escape before a 60 minute timer on the wall runs out, filling the room with toxic gas when it does.For a VR title, there were a surprisingly large number of interactive elements for such a small area. I found myself juggling items and throwing things into piles to keep track of things like I would in real life. The item interactions are intuitive as well and things like pulling nails with a crowbar or loading batteries into a flashlight working just as you would expect them to. The timer element adds another layer of tension and excitement to the game by forcing you to work quickly (don’t worry about being rushed on your first playthrough by the way, you’re going to use that entire hour.)Overall, I really liked this game! I hope there are more experiences like it in the future, as this is a game type that works really well in VR."
,Recommended,562320,29305525,Posted: 16 January,all,beefbyproducts,"At it's current price of 6 bucks, this is a decent little locked in a room VR game. The puzzles were simple enough to complete, but complex enough as to not feel too cheap. I liked things like the battery on the flashlight burning out, but I didn't like having to keep the trigger pulled down to keep the flashlight in my hand. It felt unnatural, as you wouldn't have to do that in real life. You'd be holding it, just as you would the controller. There's a number of destracting elements in there, that'll throw you off; and I like this. Not everything in the room will be useful to the end goal, and it's up to you to figure out what is.Graphiclly, it's fine(ish). They go the dark route, but don't overdo it. There's spots of light to retreat to, to feel more comfortable in. The game does feel creepy, and you do feel rushed to finish the puzzle, as it constantly feels like doom is coming your way. There's some things I disliked, but they are more in spoiler land. Overall, I think it's a decent go at it, and it's one of my favorite of the VR escape the room games we're seeing. I'd recommend picking it up."

Now that I got out, probably won't play again.Pros:  Some nice puzzels, creepy basement, beat the clock.Cons:  As others have mentioned - flashlight length, buggy grabs, story disjointed, downright ridicuous voice scripts that break the mood at times.Bottom line:  probably the best one I played so far, but developers can really step up on this genre."
,Recommended,562320,29246679,Posted: 14 January,all,virtualmarc,"A nice escape room with horror elements (probably nothing for people easily scared) and a timelimit of 1h.The puzzles are quite challenging. Had to play it twice to beat it.A main critic point is the flashlight as other stated. The batteries lying around everywhere (and there are enough for the 1h time) don't really look like batteries. I first realized that they are batteries when I accidentally put one in the back of the flashlight. So maybe the model should be changed that they look more like batteries.Also there is much stuff lying around you can not interact with most of it, which is a bit sad. So most of the things you can pick up are needed for solving the puzzles.The game does not detect the left/right hands from SteamVR. The first controller that has been powered on is the left hand. Had to switch my controllers after starting the game and seeing my hands are wrong.All in all the game is definitely worth it's money and it's better than many other vr escape rooms here on Steam."

Controls were ok. Lots of distractions. Get it on sale if you like exit room sort of stuff. Personally I was hoping for more puzzle, less creep but that's fun too. Maybe I can scare somefriends with it."
76561197970681375,Recommended,562320,28214848,"Posted: 5 December, 2016",all,ep,"This is a very fun room-scale game. The ambience is excellent--once you start it up you really get the sense that you are trapped in a reeking, decrepit basement/dungeon. During each playthrough, you have one hour to escape. I've only played it once so far but unfortunately I didn't make it out the first time around. I'll definitely play it again until I figure out how to 'win.' Expect to be crawling on all fours during this encounter. Leave no stone unturned!The only negative for me is that the voice-acting/narration is some of the worse I've ever heard. I'm not sure if it's available in multiple languages but the English version definitely needs to be re-dubbed. Overall though it's definitely worth the price of admission."

I've played it a few times and haven't been able to figure it out yet, but I get further each time. It was recently updated with graphics options that can get rid of the blurriness that some people talk about. I haven't seen any jump scares, but it's scary in a tense kind of way."

Great atmosphere, decent puzzles, I only managed to get out with two minutes left. The only issue is, as others have stated, that the flashlight dies and you need to use batteries to power it up again. Unfortunately the batteries don't look like batteries, so I didn't know to use them on the flashlight. I went through the whole game without putting any new batteries in the flashlight, just using it as a strobe light(as it flashes briefly even when out of power when you click it), assuming that was what I was supposed to be doing. I didn't encounter any glitches, which seem to plague most of the other escape games I've tried, and given its low price I definitely recommend it."

But the premise and the puzzles are pretty cool. There are a couple of things that still detract from the whole VR promise. There is a sheet covering something up in room no matter what i try i cannot uncover it. Why? My hands are there just peel it back but nope!If you fancy playing a interesting and immersive game then check it out. The replay value is slim, maybe a couple of run throughs until you solve it. But at the price point i would say its worth it.You can follow my playthrough here.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QuX3JG2XQE"

,Recommended,562320,28126425,"Posted: 1 December, 2016",all,Harvester of Sorrow,"Locked in VR is an incredible and unique escape room with a style that makes it stand out among others of it's kind.The game has you waking up in a run-down basement, full of garbage, junk, and your typical corpse hanging from the ceiling.  From there you receive a phone call saying you have a limited amount of time to find your way out.  You look at the wall in front of you with a timer that is slowly counting down from 1 hour.  Now it's a race against the clock with your own life on the line.The atmosphere is top notch.  You truly feel like you're in the disgusting basement of a serial killer.  There's dim lighting, blood on the floor, that dead body hanging above you, etc.  You really do get a sense that a deranged murder has commiting all sorts of disgusting and horrible acts in there.  The one issue with the graphics is that they are fuzzy... as if you need glasses.  It does not look as sharp and clear as in the trailer.  Even with supersampling enabled, it's not good and takes away from the otherwise impressive surroundings.If you're looking for a challenge then you have one.  I was not able to get out of the room in time and met a horrible death.  But one thing that maybe made this happen was a certain part of the game is bugged.*POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*In the game you have to find slides to place inside of a projector.  Some of the slides are worthless while some of them provide valuable information to help you escape.  When I was playing there were three slides that just would not go in the projector, while all the rest of the slides went in with no problem.  It's quite frustrating when you're towards the very end and cannot progress any further because of a bug like this. I'm curious to know if anyone else came across this issue.*END OF SPOILERS*I also had some minor issues when it came to grabbing things, which wasn't game breaking but was annoying every now and then.  And the other minor issue is the voice acting of your character; He sounds like a Russian Nathan from South Park (google him if you want to know what I mean).  I hope there comes an option to disable the narration.Despite the fuzzy graphics, the projector bug, and the poor voice acting, the game is very much worth the $6.  I trust that the projector issus will be fixed if the dev ends up reading this review and hopefully something can be done about the fuzzy graphics.TL;DR  Locked in VR has a mentally disturbing and horrific atmosphere with engaging puzzles and is one of the best escape rooms for VR to date."

My hats off to the devs. one thing i was a bit confused about was thhe flash light. At first i thought there was a part missing to it. It looks like the bulb is missing. so i kept puttting batteries in it. when all i had to do was push the button to turn it on. maybe make the end of the flashlight look shiny that the light comes out of?

I found its a good intro to VR for new players, only complaint is some of the interactions with objects can be janky at times-trouble picking things off the ground, objects falling through other objects,  these seem like common problems in many VR games right now.You'll want at least a 2mx2m space for this game."
