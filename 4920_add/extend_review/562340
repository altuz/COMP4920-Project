,Recommended,562340,32176108,Posted: 4 June,all,inwerp,"I would recommend this game for everyone who loves small state of art arcade dogfight games. it is a pretty conservative game by design and development and i see huge time investment from this small 2-person studio. Also it is the great example of a custom engine graphics which looks surprisingly well, some shaders are absolutely amazing (like rain/water/ sun effects). This game also has the best cockpit i have ever seen in flight simulators. Shame it's ""hidden"" by the need to press ""back"" button.The graphics is unique and pretty realistic, ground detail is also really great (you can also hear cows say ""moo"" when you fly close to the ground :-).I'm not about to start Nvidia vs AMD war here, but it is pretty usual to see ""game broken"" from the green guys on steam these days as well as performance issues from people with 1080 cards. I would recommend people who experience technical issues not to use negative reviews as a bugreport or at least, cooperate with the developers because people who made their own engine are clearly good enough to make it work on your device too. It is simply impossible to fix all isues in advance, so be patient - even AAA titles have lots of technical issues nowadays.Had zero problems on AMD 480 rx, ~150-180 fps on high settings.Some people here complain about voice acting / story. Found nothing to worry about, voice acting is okay, facial animations are handmade but still better than ME:A. Did not finish the story yet, butI don't think that story really matters in arcade dogfight games, also i would rather see all arcade levels unlocked instead of going through the whole story."

It really should be noted more clearly that a controller is needed, but since I have one, no big deal for me.But the story, dialogue, voice acting, cut scenes, missions... basically anything on the non-graphical artistic side... are so bad as to be distracting. I mean it'sbaaaaad. I've been trying to discover if this is an English translation of a Japanese game or something, because the difference in quality between the gameplay and the story are stark in a way I think I've never seen before. Maybe X2 was this bad, they couldn't even get the 3d model skeletons to stay inside bodies... this at least has that bit covered.Subtitles only would be a huge improvement. Hell, literally removing the story would help. Playing while muted strongly recommended, if at all."

Developers need to get this through their thick heads - grind is not fun. Checkout Flatout 4 as prime example of this.  Plus black screens. Plus  interminable loading times even though I have SSD.  As someone once said in a film, he aint pretty no more."
76561198044618619,Recommended,562340,33560601,Posted: 15 July,all,ChrisR,"Terrific graphics - really first rate. The alternate history style and story are creative and well done. The developers deserve credit for improving this game, and the recently added joystick control is great when you are looking forward. I think the new joystick controls do add some new user interface problems - it is hard to fly with a joystick when you are trying to drop bomds or need to look at a waypoint. Maybe they can add an autopilot, an external bomb view, or a picture-in-picture mode that allows you to see the horizon in the inset and the bombsite/target in the other wiindow. In general the user interface has a few rough edges, though some were added by adding the new joystick control. The missions are really hard, and maybe the times to complete missions could be relaxed for the rookie mode. Despite these minor blemishes, this is a truly inspiring game. Really the best in its genre and makes many other games look dated. If the developers can iron out the minor issues this could well become a classic, and the foundation for many great games. I am more of an arcade player, but aspects of this remind me of Crimson Skies in the best possible way. I do hope they deliver on the potential and that this game achieves enough success to consider sequels."
76561198041571110,Recommended,562340,33778262,Posted: 24 July,all,Turjav,"Pros:Graphics are beautifulMusic and general mood are optimistic and upliftingThe game seems to be trying with some new ideas for mechanicsYou can replay missions (but you don't get anything for doing so)Cons:First of all, you MUST have a controller to play this game. It doesn't work with a keyboard and mouse.Controls cannot be customizedI found at least one bug in the first mission. During the part where you are supposed to follow a radio signal (not really a good mechanic in how it's executed btw) screen fades to black so although the mission continues, you can't see where you are going. I tried restarting the checkpoint many times and the same problem persisted so I closed the game and did it again and this time, it worked.EXTREMELY long loading timesIf you replay missions, you don't get any money for doing it. Very disappointing since I wanted to buy a better plane."

Maybe I'll try the game later...Really should have been there on release as some of us 'older' people have NEVER touched a controller.I will change to thumbs up purely because there was actually a response and a fix! Probably a 1st for me :)
76561198112037188,Recommended,562340,32524901,Posted: 17 June,all,bob,"This is a quick early review to give the game a deserved thumbs up! Look at the total time played by the negative reviews, people aren't even getting into the dogfights before they refund and write a bad review. It's very arcadey (in a cool way), but looks fantastic and is a blast in dogfights and I haven't had any problems, except 1 freeze up. Totally different from other games I've played, there is a learning curve for some missions, but older gamers shouldn't mind replaying missions to finish them and there are checkpoint restarts.Check it out for yourself, but the 2 hour refund policy seems to hurt a game like this where you need to learn a few things before they give you access to the good stuff. I wish more was unlocked to start with, but you have to unlock some stuff and buy other planes and upgrades with  money earned in the game.After 7 hours of play I am still enjoying the new missions and even though the story and the character voices are a little cheesey (but aren't most arcade games) you only need to listen to them one time in a cut scene and then skip them (the skip is available right away)."

76561197965004501,Recommended,562340,34201492,Posted: 12 August,all,cloister56,"Iron Wings is a solid and enjoyable game let down a little by presentation.You play as Jack and Amelia, 2 pilots during World War 2. The game is similar to Ace Combat without obviously any missiles.  The control scheme is simplified but still makes it enjoyable to fly and is easy to pick up. The game is a decent length taking me just short of 10 hours to complete the campaign. There is also a good degree of variety in the missions and new elements introduced along the way.The presentation is a little odd. There are numerous gramatical errors and odd word choices in both the subtitles and voice acting. It can be a little jarring but I found it quite endearing. The graphics are pretty impressive for an indie and are on par with Assault Horizon.There are multiple planes to fly but they don't really feel all that different. As there is no information on the planes about speed or manouverability to help you choose I assume they are really just skins of the base model.So if you enjoy Ace Combat and want something similarly arcadey and a little quirky then I would recommend this title. It's probably a sale title for most."
,Not Recommended,562340,33659739,Posted: 19 July,all,[BacEn] Jobbo_Fett,"This game is terrible.  Repetitive cutscenes during gameplay, which is poor and more repetitive than re-runs of Dragonball Z.  It is guaranteed that you will lose missions, either due to friendly ai incompetence, or the lack of balanced gameplay.  The story attempts what I can only imagine is some alternate timeline because its full of ahistorical moments.  I can't even remember the music, but the character audio is a weak point of the game, which is a shame since the two main characters talk so damn much!For reference, I played up to the 3rd-4th(?) mission before calling it quits for good.  This game is way too repetitive, killing any enjoyment I may have had.Favorite moments of the game include:-*After shooting down an enemy*  ""THAT'S ONE MORE LESS!""-Spelling a P-38 Lightning ""Lightening""-Enemy planes can shoot at you regardless if you are behind, below, or beside them.  This includes any aircraft that had forward-firing only weapons."
