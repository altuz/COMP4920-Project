Challenging but fair game, and fun to replay a bunch, give it a try!"
76561197971341065,Recommended,562360,29554229,Posted: 28 January,all,sfnhltb,"A cheap vertical scrolling shoot em up, it is playable enough and can be fun at times but frustrating at others - the power ups are essential but random drops, so some games you will have it easy, others you are basically doomed as the enemies get tougher so you can shoot less of them, further reducing your chances of getting more power ups and getting back on track.The controls are fine, the graphics are basic but functional, and the difficulty curve of the enemies is reasonable (although the dual firing heavy you start getting at level 4 are difficult to kill reliably unless you get really lucky with power ups to that point). At some points later on you start getting narrow passages only just wide enough for your plane, which seems to defeat the object of the game as you just have to stay there and get hit by anything that fires before your bullets hit them.The scoring is combo based, so you get a rising multiplier (up to 9x I think) if you don't let any enemies exit the screen, any that do resets the multipler to x1 and you have to start again. This works quite well apart from the previously mentioned randomness of power ups meaning your score depends on luck as much as skill or learning the enemies. Another issue is the sharp corners and split routes that make it difficult or impossible to continue your streak.Overall an okay shoot em up, but there is nothing really special about it either. Also I don't remember buying it, it just appeared in my games list a couple of weeks back, was it meant to be a free copy to review, I have no idea."

But since the dev is more like Brazilian it might be just a fan project of Russian aircrafts. Indeed there are many historical models available and the soundtrack contains some Russian radiotalks. But the main difference to samoliotik is the non-understanding of propaganda symbols, the atmosphere and the play with it. Samoliotik is so trashy that's it's even good. Instead the dev tried here to build a better controlable and playable topdown portrait shoot'em'up. Samoliotik has only mouse controls, but here is WASD+L for shoot. And from shot enemies dropped updates can become permanent upgrades in the 3 categories power / gun / ratio. That's a decent improvement. But why I'm still unsatisfied with this game? The levels are too empty, only tube levels and no big surprises. So it turns out boring to grind for 10k kills for the last achievement."

,Recommended,562360,34855790,Posted: 10 September,all,Tablis,"I got this because I thought it resembles River Raid and it does, to an extent. It's fun at first but gets boring dissapointingly quickly; that elusive drive to play again is not quite there. The fervent red-and-black colour scheme was giving me headaches and vertigo, but in the most recent update the dev added an option to change the background to gray and that helps a ton. What is still missing, is an option to turn off controller vibration (which seems to be set to max) - I'm too lazy to unplug my gamepad and it just flops around wildly while I play on keyboard. As for the achievements, maybe I just suck but I found some of them way too hard; if you're the type that does everything legit, prepare for frustration. Normally I would consider giving a thumbs down for difficult achievements, but not everyone cares about that and the game is pretty decent for one EUR."

""Destroy 1K planes"" In one run? Or in total?Needless to say the game dosen't last long.Infact this review will probably take longer to write than for you to complete most of the game... well, if you are compatant at bullet hells at least, with 50+ hours in Suguri I feel as I can say that this game is easy... somewhat, you would not belive how quickly you can die, a couple of seconds at most if you forget what button is fire (It's X of all things). This game is... different in many ways, for instance this is the only top-down bullet-hell I've played where you can't touch the walls, which makes manunerving hard, that's good in many ways, it ups the difficulty to a good level.Soundtrack is good too.But, nothing is perfect, even a transfer of energy, so what's wrong with this game?Simple, hit detection is a bit off, hit boxes seem a bit too far forward for colision damage, the starting weapon fires a bit too slow to be effective, that or the enemy planes move to fast at first. And if you get 1) there are no invinceability frames and 2) YOU WILL NOT NOTICE. It is neigh impossible to tell if you got hit unless you are watching the bullet hit you and.Wait, what's this? 99 cents default price... CUCKING SOLDI got it for fifty cents in the winter sale, hell you could buy this just with the cards you will end up selling in the sale, so it's price makes it great, plus gameplay is fun while it lasts, and the music. This is a game you would come back to once every couple of weeks or months and play once or twice then put down again because you've gotten every achivement in your new ALT account you've dedicated to this game and you'll have to make another to get every achivement again.Good game, deicent ST, great priceShockingly short, sometimes VERY easy other times hard, odd hit detction and little replayability due to it's length.Then there is the drop systemMe: ""Game I have every upgrade done in 2/3 trees can you give me something that I can reach/ isn't health""Game: ""What's that? More health? Okay""twenty seconds laterMe ""Game thanks for giving me a few upgrades that I could now I need some health""Game: ""OH NOW THAT'S JUST PICKY I'M GONNA THROW A NEW ENEMY AT YOU JUST TO SHUT YOU UP""it's picky at best, the RNG is a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(Level 6 and haven't seen an upgrade) (YES THAT HAPPENED TO ME JUST BEFORE I WROTE THIS)It's a good game, but could use improvements in some areas, achivements are rediclusly easy to get (I was joking about the ALT acount stuff) however the pirce of 0.99USD makes up for it majorly.I'll recomend... barely."

Achievements are relatively easy to get.Also after 2.5 hours of straight playing, you get the wildest optical illusions, it looks like my computer is stretching out and hovering.The only kind of lame thing was after playing over and over, you can predict where each plane will be and it gets kinda boring after that.Overall opinion: 8/10"

I always like to check out the games that I get coupons for because most of the time they are pretty bad and are good to laugh at. However when I saw this game I was pretty suprised. It had a simple premise, ok visuals, and good reviews. I then proceeded to get all the achievements in 2 hours. This was a pretty good experience except for the slight headache I had afterwards, which I could have avoided by just changing the color scheme."

,Recommended,562360,32990305,Posted: 29 June,all,Nodicus,"Planes, Bullets, and Vodka: A game with lots of planes, lots of bullets, and very little vodka (unless you bring your own.)This is probably the simplest Shmup I've ever played. You're just a plane, shooting at other planes while they get more numerous and the cooridors change. It's got your standard drops: Health, bigger health, more health, shield, bigger bullets, rapid fire and spread. Simple, yes, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't get my heart rate up while trying to get the highscore achievement. It was actually quite entertaining for that purpose. There's some luck involved with your chances of getting far in this game however. Sometimes you can get 3 bullet upgrades in the first wave while other times you'll be waiting around til the fourth level for them. That part is somewhat frustrating, but you can always quick-restart. I got this game for $0.49 which overall is a fine price. Even at $0.99 I'd say it's fair. Music's alright too. It's got a little variety and didn't bother me enough to change it during my playtime."

You just steer plane and try to down as many other aircraft as you can while collecting powerups and healthpackets. The game gets more difficult as you progress and that makes you hate rng more and more when you go into lvl 2 without gaining single powerup.

Look it up, its the perfect match!The dynamically generated maps can make for some interesting challenges, especially once you clear level 5 and are dealing with a lot of returned fire.   The game rewards you for racking up kills and not slacking off;  the powerups arent' timed or generous like in many scrolling shooters, and the ability to continue really depends on whether or not you kill enough enemies to spawn  enough powerups.   If your plane is too underpowered at any point, you won't last much longer.The color scheme makes it easy to zone into, but be ready for Virtual-Boy esque disorientation when you close the game!"
