Most people dream of becoming a superhero or president or a member of isis, but not me. I had a greater dream. A dream like nothing else. Perhaps it was the greatest dream of all time?I had only one goal. One dream. To become an anime girl's striped panties, able to soar through the skies, fighting other panties. Shooting lasers, and gracefully dodge any attack. I have now achieved that dream."

,Recommended,562410,31265485,Posted: 20 April,all,Buttered Falcon,"To be honest, I didn't even know what to expect. While it might be panties fighting panties, and that is really weird if you really think about it.... I actually kinda enjoyed the silliness of the concept.It was a good hack and slash game, with a decent short story. Wouldn't say it is worth the price but still a fun and silly game nonetheless.8/10 - made me laugh, good game."
,Recommended,562410,29475768,Posted: 24 January,all,Rimelight,At first I was all aboard the Sailor Panties for the Poi and Pan-Paka-Pan.Then I unlocked the Tentacle Panties and my life changed.Needs PvP otherwise this is GOTY material.
,Recommended,562410,29494942,Posted: 25 January,all,Ghostlyy,"Legitimately a fun little third person shooter/brawler. Getting used to how the game plays takes quite some time, at least it did for me. There are a number of problems that make it easier/harder than it should be due to exploitability, but even with these the game is honestly fun to play, between the mechanical feel of moving/jumping/attacking, the adorable if simple visuals and peppy slice-of-life sounding music.It has japanese voice acting! And it's actually good! I really was not expecting that and it made the game so much more enjoyable.Feels like a relatively quickly made indie title, in terms of a short story mode (2 hours, including replaying missions to complete secondary objectives to unlock panties), a limited arcade mode (quite a bit of time to put into it, but not a huge amount of variety), and in general the feel of the game as a whole. It has that Unity 3DThe most basic anime-style humour in the writing, so naturally I chuckled and groaned throughout the basic story mode. The absurdity of the scenario combined with the not-very-serious attitude the writers took to the game is probably what I  like most about this.Favourite panties to play as: Striped Panty. Shimapan truly brings out the DBZ-esque side of this game.Favourite panty style: Haruka, definitely. Yurika looks really good, as does the simple Classic Bear, but the Haruka style is just too cute."

,Recommended,562410,29557165,Posted: 28 January,all,Psychii,"The Warriors of Love band together to save the world!Panty Party isn't exactly about parties or anything. It's a casual fighting game (or a shooter since some of the 'characters' have weapons) with a silly premise.Story: (Yes, there is one)An evil panty named ""Panzi"" wants to take over the world. She and her group of panties plan to brainwash all humans and make them only love panties. Obviously, no one wants to be forced to love something. Our main protagonist, Yurika, meets a panty named ""Baka Pan"". After Baka Pan tells Yurika the evil plans of Panzi, it's up to her and some allies she will meet to stop Panzi's evil plan.Yurika and her allies can turn into panties to fight so that's why you fight as a panty.The Visual Novel PartThere are short VN stories that take place after and before battles which advance the story. These are voiced and usually last around 20-40 seconds.Gameplay:I'm not so sure what kind of game would be related to Panty Party. In short, you are dropped into a small arena and your objective is to defeat the boss or to eliminate all enemy panties. As you beat some level requirements, you will unlock new panties (basically, character's with different abilities).Each Panty has 3 attacks and a 4th special attack that can give them a powerful weapon to use.So far, I'm loving Rin because her melee attacks are quite powerful. In addition, Cool Kuma not only boasts a cool voice, but is pretty much the ""Gun's blazing"" type of panty fighter.In all seriousness, combat will be hilarious for maybe the first 10 minutes. After a while, it can get annoying how some bosses can ""stun"" you making you have to wait until an ability recharges again.Sound:Voice acting is not too bad here. There's no lewd sounds here (except for one or two panties that let out a moan when you activate their special ability). The battle music pumps you up, but it's nothing too special.Should you buy it?The main game can be completed in around 2 hours. If you want to have a laugh at a ridiculous plot about Panties saving the world, go ahead. If you are looking for a decent combat game, this isn't the place."

Its like a 3rd person, flying shooter BUT WITH PANTIES! very easy to grasp and play, the selection of panties is quite nice but I was left wanting more!The story: Is just fun nonsense and I loved it!Gameplay: You fly around as a panty and shoot other panties, each panty has their own special abilities, one shoots a boomerang, another shoots canon shots, another shoots a grapling hook etc. very creative! I ended up using Yurika and the Sailor Panty the most, they got the job done.The content: It didn't have much to offer, the story mode is 20 Missions while the Arcade is 6 routes with different endings and 5 stages each (all the same stages as story mode, I noticed a different boss here and there).Graphics: The game looks great in my opinion, the stages and panties look nice. I did like the way the characters were drawn for the story scenes.Sound: I did enjoy all the voice actors, It is all in Japanese which was cool. The actors sounded very natural and they did fit their role, yes even the panties talk :3Cons: The game stuttered a bit when there were many panties on screen and we were all shooting but other then that nothing, in my 7hrs playthrough I didn't encounter any problems, no crashes or anything. Nice!Overall Opinion: I enjoyed the game and hope their is a sequel! I payed 8.99USD for it and I don't regret it, I 100% it in around 7hrs. For the price I payed I got my moneys worth.Final Thoughts: I was thinking I WANT MORE FANSERVICE! Many games don't offer enough panties shots or shy away from them, BUT THIS GAME! GAVE ME THE PANTIES THEMSELVES! Well played."
