Honestly I'd love to see it become something similar to command and conquer generals.Note: Alot of this is for the devsThings I'd recommend fixing:Being able to click on enemy units and see their health, damage, ect.Art up the command and control panel. Being able to see through the slightly opaque  box causes a loss of character in the factions.Add more units in general. While I love how many subfactions you have I think you have too many to be honest, at least for now. While I get the feeling that you are trying to balance it I think having more specialized units for both factions would be nice. For example in my first game I had no clue what was anti air and when I found that said unit, while it said it was anti air it was barely effective. I think you should try going a little more sci-fi with the Gaia faction maybe use a laser AA system.NOTE: Only replace a main faction unit if its better then the orginal. While yes its nice to have different units per different play style to fit every player. I take this inspiration of Wargame :RD and Wargame: ALB. There are thousands of units if you haven't played it and while some are super similar the difference between them is same exact weapon excepts one has tracks with greater armor and the other wheels with less armor which I can see you have tried to implement but due to your map design and the current  agression of unit AI less armor and more speed is a bad thing because kiting in a straight line will eventually end up with you having no place to run.NAVY IS OP compared to land units. The Navy can just choke you out. I'd like to see much less of this. While Naval power is important its really stupid (although unrealistic) when any navy unit pretty much beats out any land unit in a one on one engagement due to firing range. I love the Scale of your ships I really do but I think you went too big to be honest at least for these maps! You should add in many more escourt class style vessels. I'd really look to Wargame: RD they have tons of ships. Don't remove any ships though! I'd suggest making stuff like the Carrier more of a Super Weapon to be honest but please make the jets weaker so much so that they can actually die being able to Nuke any ship in the game with one run is OP which blows the Steel Alliances Battleship out of the water.I'm really curious as to what you guys (devs) think. Message me sometime, I've played tons of RTS games and would love to see this one shine. I want to know your thoughts and maybe help out! I'd love to know more about the story as well!Would I recommend this game?I would, but its still too Raw for anyone not new to the RTS scene to enjoy."

A pathetic little actually.But the game. Is. Fun.I whole heartedly recomend Armor Clash II as a fun Indie RTS for all RTS fans."

The game’s frame rate plummets when having more than 9 units on screen, unit’s AI is meh, terrible map design, nice unit models, lacking in content for a $15 game.Long: Game has two factions, absolutely minimal distinction apart from unit models. Both factions have air, land and navy units. They all have the same infantry units, the same air units and 50% same navy units. Land units use different models and have different performances. Though I’m disappointed in the gameplay aspects, the unit designs are pretty solid for a unity game. However, the model for air unit “Gunship” looks terrible, the helicopter propeller looks like an octopus going nuts. Also, the maps are too small, the resource display is just a slit of numbers above the mini map, the unit description is minimal and keyboard usage is absolutely nonexistent. I must say I was genuinely hyped as a C&C Generals fan and had high hopes for this game, but I guess RTS is dead now. 6/10, not worth buying for $15.Below added on 22:15, Apr 5thOh yeah and the voice acting is meh. There is this one cheesy fake Australian accent for the gunboat and one of the tanks (some units use the same voices), it made me cringe every time I hear it. AND the devs didn’t even bother to add radio effects for some of the voices, this was the most emersion-breaking.Below added on 13:18, Apr 6thI just instaled an update and changes in the menu is in the correct direction. I would still like to see changes in the AI department though. Most maps have bridges which can be a nightmare to get forces to cross, and one of the units I couldn't remenber it's name(a buggie with anti-tank rockets) gets stuck and bugs out on bridges constantly. Right now for me only the map ""Green zone"" is playable because it doesnt have bridges.Below added on 14:44, Apr 7thAnother update is done by the dev. Though I was originally disappointed by the content and some minor issues regarding map design and gameplay, I have to say the dev is constantly trying to improve the game. This is a good sign. As though the game lacks content, the base of the game (the structure) is very well done. Therefore, I think the dev doesn’t have to make big changes to improve the game by a big margin. This is why I believe with the kind of constant dev support I’m seeing today, this game is worth buying."

Its very barebones and lacks content and polish, no strategy is needed, its just biuld units and rush foward.This game has alot of potential just needs a bit of work"

,Recommended,562420,32141246,Posted: 2 June,all,Dominik Frey more like food trey,"Before I begin, I have done a single match.I like to game a 4/10 as it is now. While it certainly leaves a lot to be desired, the game itself is a very good teaching tool for the concept of strategy in general, specificially combined land/air/naval assaults. The AI is neither good nor terrible, providing a casual challenge to the player.The voice-acting could certainly use an improvement, and I'd love to have some in-game music as opposed to me playing whatever music I have on my computer. There are a good amount of typos that I would like to see corrected in the game itself, but understand that this gamew as released only two months ago and was most recently updated 3 days ago. This game is in it's infancy and I am optimistic that Windforce is working on refining the game."

It was fun for the first few matches against AI but after that seems like a build'em then rush no strategy needed. It does have lots of potential maybe in future updates they will add the things that make RTS.

I played already the first armor clash and can state that the second part has done a nice evolution.Hopefully the third part is coming and eliminates the remaining lacks, would pay at least 20 bucks for part 3 ^^"

76561197970560363,Not Recommended,562420,33419709,Posted: 9 July,all,gameplayer13905,This game looks like early access but it is not. I bought this game because it has a vehicle center which looks exactly like the one from the original Command & Conquer - a landing pad with a cargo plane that drops the vehicle. I wanted to like this game but I cannot.IT HAS NO MISSIONS WHATSOEVER. It only has skirmish maps and a quick combat feature that randomly selects a skirmish map. Do not waste your money on this game. I'm asking for a refund.

Maybe it is, but it  developer has a lot of passion in creating, which lacks in most of mainstream games.That's why I bought game, because work of Windforce is worth contributing and support by gamers - especially if you are die hard Command & Conquer fan."
