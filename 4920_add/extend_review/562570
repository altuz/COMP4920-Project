,Not Recommended,562570,29786620,Posted: 8 February,all,Mimiru,"This game has a nice concept, presentation and the controls are simple, but the puzzles themselves are really lacking. The first 10 or so serve the purpose of a tutorial and the rest of them are either really easy with the answer right in your face or intentionally misleading, providing the player with information that is completely irrelevant to the answer. Some of them are pure trial and error, and some don't make much sense, hardly puzzles at all. I found that out of the 36 levels, very few were enjoyable and genuinely challenging.I'm giving this game a 6/10.It's okay to kill some time but not a good puzzler. If you want a similar, better option, I'd recommend The Room."

Most of the puzzles are simplistic, not requiring any thinking. ""Hard"" puzzles are only hard because of lack of any clues, e.g.: rotatable device (like in safes hacked in movies) and 2 numbers. So you should rotate without any feedback and hope that something happens. No idea which way to rotate.Just no."

,Recommended,562570,28477865,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,roscone,"This game is a series of puzzle boxes, nothing more, nothing less.That's exactly what I wanted. Every puzzle gives you exactly enough information to solve it. The nicely rendered sci-fi setting gives enough set dressing to put you into the world around these clever little boxes without being distracting.My only disappointment is that the 36 puzzles go too quickly. Here's hoping a new set of puzzles show up at some point, but even if they don't I enjoyed my time with this game.Color-blind note: There are a number of color-based puzzles. Just make sure you give these screenshots a close look to make sure you can tell everything apart."

If story is important to you, stay away as there is none. That said, when judged solely on puzzle content, there's a lot here for the very low price tag."

A couple of reviews say that some of the puzzles are just trial and error or don't make sense at all, but it's not the case. All the puzzles can be understood, and if there's a puzzle that doesn't seem to make sense you just have to work harder to understand it.Overall it's not too complicated and pretty short. There are only 36 puzzles and it took me less than an hour to complete. It'd be nice if more puzzles were added to it later on, but even if it doesn't happen, for the price it's still worth it if you like puzzles."

76561197986952100,Recommended,562570,28970768,Posted: 3 January,all,denoevyn,"A very interesting idea for a puzzle game. The puzzles are mostly casual (and straightforward), except for a few odd ones that include a certain twist.The graphics are nice, there is only minimal sound, and the controls are very clunky and counterintuitive at times.Still, I like the idea and most parts of its execution. Plus: Simple achievements for achievement hunters."

I used a mouse to play this game and unfortunately it was overly sensitive when trying to turn the cubes. Overall, not too happy with the game but as it was only 90p I'm not that bothered."
,Not Recommended,562570,32785803,Posted: 25 June,all,Blü,"Yeah this game isn't fun, the puzzles are badly designed, and the last puzzle is probably the worst example of that.There are also puzzles that are just trial and error, so you basicaly waste time trying to figure out a way to logcaly find out the info that you need to complete the puzzle, when there is absolutely none (puzzle #13 comes to mind).so all in all, I'd suggest that you avoid this game, if you want a similar game (a series of boxes that you need to solce), I'd recommend the room 1 & 2, or if you're jsut looking for a good puzzle game, look into the black watchmen."
,Recommended,562570,33358123,Posted: 7 July,all,Dampfbacke,"Quite a nice little puzzle game in the style of ""The Room"", but it's lacking any story, and graphics seem to prefer style over design: It looks nice and shiny, but the game is buggy, and controls are clunky. There's quite a number of times where you have to turn a dial, and it feels like a mobile port designed for touchscreens, not for mouse users. The dials go everywhere exept for the one place you want to set it, and though it forces the player to think a little bit harder because brute forcing becomes neigh impossible due to frustration (turn three dials with twelve settings each …), it's no fun even if you know the solution.There's no feeling of reward - though the sales pitch tells a story of a not-so-distand furture where personal data being stored in elaborate boxes, you never get to see the contents of the box you've just cracked. There's some blue light, and that's it, next box. I imagined myself in the role of a professional cracker who constantly keeps asking himself ""Why the hell am I still doing this?"". Even my Windows 3.0 Mahjongg game rewarded me with a fortune-cooky-style saying if I solved one. Here, I get nothing. Okay, there was somecakein the end, but it didn't even lookedible.As for being buggy: The boxes sit on a kind of desk, where you can turn them around (and a little bit up and down), zoom in and out to find details (not that looking for minute detail is required for more than one puzzle). It happened four or five times that I found myself trapped inside the cube (thus knowing they are empty and not worth the efford), and hitting Escape in order to get to the menus leads to the images rotating maniacally, forcing me to end the game via task manager. Made me twitch and felt cheap.Still, it's a recommendation. I payed less than one Euro in the summer sale and spent a couple of hours with twisting, turning (and cursing dials). You can replay the puzzles, but why bother? It's play and uninstall, there's hundred of nice (or not so nice) puzzle games on Steam, but I had some fun, making it fifty cent (or so) well spent."

76561197992146150,Not Recommended,562570,33386385,Posted: 8 July,all,FiendishFez,"Conceptually, this is the kind of puzzle game that is right up my alley with the sort of puzzle cube design. Sadly the game is unplayable as it was clearly made for a touch screen and does not support controllers. You can use a mouse to play but it just doesn't work. Many of the puzzles require you to read and translate a series of symbols that all look the same due to the low graphical quality of the engine. A good concept with a few fatal execution issues."
,Recommended,562570,30513793,Posted: 14 March,all,Brazo,"Interesting game with tough challenges.For me the only downside was the mouse controls. Sometimes I had to repeat to movement more than 1 time, since the mouse just went 'crazy' mode and lost track of the movements."

Takes a lot of thinking to figure out the objective of some of the puzzles, but seems easy when you figure out what you have to do. Hopefully in the future they will add more and more levels to the game. Not exactly expensive to buy which is also nice too, burns through an hour or so of your free time. Achievements are nice, not very difficult to get. 100% on the game to add to the perfect games list on the Achievement Showcase."

It's maybe a little weird to say that about such a simple puzzle game...but a lot of thought and care went into the background setting. Fullscreen on my UWD monitor with the sound going...ugh, just so freakin' calming and delightful. I hope we get some extra levels, because this is the kind of place I want to come and spend a few minutes every day.The mechanics are fine, and the puzzles are maybe a little simple sometimes, but not bad. I want a sequel where I get to come to this desk and just tinker with crap for a while while listening to the rain and watching the clock tick over.Puzzle game: 7/10: a little short, a little simplistic, but nicely designed.Workplace environment simulation: 11/10: Please can I live here and work here and never leave?"

76561198172392767,Recommended,562570,34814331,Posted: 8 September,all,Hollow,"Not much to say, solid game: The game shows you one object after another, while pressing the right mouse button you rotate the object, while pressing the left mouse button you can interact with the object's buttons or whatever it has on it and that's it. With that you've to solve your way through the boxes' different mechanics to unlock them. In case you're stuck with a solution you're allowed to skip an object after some time spent with it. Progress is saved automatically. Didn't encounter any bugs or issues (Win7 64bit).Enjoyable, except for 5 boxes (31 out of 36 = fun) for me (#35 is bugged: wrong color scheme). Enjoyed #24 the most.It's kind of a short game so even with the low shop price on Steam I'd still wait for a discount.Spoiler: bad boxes & solutionsExcept for 5 objects enjoyable: (sadly the later ones)-30: requires you to color all fields blue; kinda hard to guess what you're supposed to do due to the lack of infos / hints-31: while there's nothing inherently wrong with that one it's rather the weakness of the human brain that annoys me here to have a harder time at thinking things anew in a different way than learnt previously; balance chemicals out opposed to maxing them out-33: doesn't fit in with the rest of the objects in terms of difficulty / approach ot the solution and should be one of the earlier boxes opposed to one of the last few; symbols are carved into / appear on the box-35: the color scheme is just plain wrong (see: yellow pattern); had to use a solution for that one due to that... see youtube video link below if also stuck here-36: lame compared to previous objects; the solution relies on blind / frustrated clicks on the object that have most likely been made on other objects before but to no avail there; here it's actually the solution; left-click all brown plastic corner pieces until you hit the right oneObjects 25-36 walkthrough on youtube: video id 07JpMZcL5bI"
