,Not Recommended,562590,29508520,Posted: 26 January,all,Velmarshal,"UPDATE: Developers have mentioned in Dev Diary #22 that they are planning to redesign arenas among other things. Look it up on the official website in the ""News"" tab.TL:DR for ex-robocraft players: You are playing Mars Crater and everyone is playing Rail Walkers.TL:DR (for everyone else) - Small maps, little cover and auto-spottingkindafavor the point and click nature of long range armor cubes.The game itself has massive potential, though it's currently plagued by a couple of problems that complement each other resulting in a huge issue..By reading other reviews you are probably aware of the ""long range"" builds issue with about 44.2% of the community focusing on two longest range weapons. You can find the data on the Dev diary #21 on the official site.I mean Jesus, how do you end up with almost half the community using only two weapons out of 7 total?We'll I'll tell ya, now buckle up, this is gonna be a long one.(As usually happens with my rants when I have a love/hate relationship with something)The major factors that are causing this issue:1. Automatic spotting regardless of distance2. Relatively small maps with huge open areas and very little to no cover3. Simpler ship design when building a long range build. (fewer things to worry about)4. The ""buffer""#1 - Automatic spotting regardless of distanceLooking at this alone doesn't seem like a huge deal, and insomeareas ofsomemaps its not a big problem. But it gets worse, or better in the case of 44.2% of players. xD#2 - Relatively small maps with huge open areas and very little to no coverNow when we look at the number 1 and 2 together, you don't need a PhD in map design to figure out which classes will benefit the most out of that. Add more stuff to maps, don't leave such massive open areas that allow the long ranged ships spot and engage threats the moment they get in range.Some potential weapon solutions can be seen in Robocraft ( I know I keep comparing these two, but alot of the problems are pretty much interchangeable). The range advantage was was reduced by adding the laser indicator that lets the targeted player know that they are being targeted, so he can start dodging or engage back. Other things that reduced the effectiveness of the long range (railguns atleast) were the slow turn rate and somewhat long recharge time between shots, leaving them vulnerable to fast moving close range vehicles and forcing them to pick their shots and not just spam left click at the first name that turns white.#3 - Simpler ship design when building a long range build.It's like point building characters in RPGs, you will have dumpstats, aka aspects that will get neglected to the lowest possible state that doesn't overall compromise the build in a significant way.You don't need insane speed, or incredibly fast turning rates, mostly because you can outrange or match anything that can threaten you the moment it's in your line of sight. Not to mention, you'll probably be aware of the threat long before they get to threaten you due to how the spotting works right now.So the result is people simply making so called ""Borg cubes"" that cover a large portion of the map, particularly from the top.4. The distance ""buffer"".You will notice that gauss based builds end up dying far less often than average (in the graphs I initially mentioned). Atleast in the case of cannons, they have that buffer distance which allows them to engage the short/medium ranged enemy long before they are within range to respond. That usually results in you loosing a component, getting your core exposed or even getting outright destroyed before reaching cover.Now some will argue that they ""need to git gud"" and dodge, which you can try, but as mentioned in 1. and 2. the maps are universally open if not to all sides then atleast from above. to amplify the problem further, you will be constantly marked as long as you are in the line of sight of any other enemy, which is pretty much all of the time, resulting in the long range ship being ready for you once you pop out of cover whether to engange him or run away.Essentially the effective range importance goes up as the map size and complexity go down. You cover a much bigger portion of the map and you end up threatening other ships from further away, while they have no effective way of fighting back.Imagine encountering a group of such long ranged ships (with ~44.2% of people playing like that, that is statistically unavoidable) that can virtually make the entire map their killzone, while being able to cover each other at the same time. Countering something like that, well it leaves you with with few options out of which the most popular one is ""Leave match"".The change the devs did on these weapons is welcome (largely futile), but it's only treating the symptom, not the cause.Nerfing the cannons is merely a bandaid measure. As long as the maps are designed with large open areas where you'd get spotted the moment you pop out the domminant weapon will be whichever weapon has the longest range and the lowest skill requirement to use. Nerf the cannons and ubers bellow 3000, cruise missles will become popular, nerf the missles, heavy lasers will become popular. Balacing weapons this way can only go so far as it turns into a race to the bottom.Other issue I have to mention are the range/damage abilities. This is an issue I often see with games that have any sort of customization.If you intend to give players utility, stick to utility. The moment you give them ways to shorten the TTK (TTK - Time To Kill) those abilities will become the go-to abilities.Anyone who has played CoD4 MW1 knows this, with everyone picking Stopping Power perk +40% DMG, essentially shortening the TTK by 1 hit on average. And in a game where most automatic weapons kill in 3 to 4 hits, lowering that by 1 is a huge deal.Warframe also fell into this trap of the ""game of numbers"" years ago, with all weapon and warframe builds being laser focused on dishing out the highest possible DPS and some CC (though CC is another story).So these are all the problems, but what of solutions. Well those might be obvious at the first glance, but will take a lot of work and time.Larger maps, add some complexity, like those holes in that rock platform that cant fit oversized ships (forgot the name of the map).No auto-spotting, use radars and jammers if you have to have an automatic way of spotting. Rewarding scouting and supporting in general would be a good idea as well.The reason I wrote the ""Great Wall of China"" of text is that I really like this game and I'd hate to see it go down the same road of mistakes I've seen so many games follow. You guys have a good thing going here, don't let it go down in history like another robocraft.Also from the data devs gave in that table show other implications besides the sheer popularity.Average K/D ratiosGauss Cannon: 1.47Gattling Gauss: 1.34 (despite having the highest average kills)Heavy Laser and Uber Cannon: 1.75 (the difference is 0.01)Cruise missle: 0.97 (Probabbly due to the fiddly nature of the rocket AI)And then the interesting partPhaser: 0.84Rocket Launchers: 0.71So it must be a coincidence that the weapons that have the lowest K/D on average are also the weapons with the shortest range."
76561198020824886,Recommended,562590,30169181,Posted: 25 February,all,karn987,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWNot a bad game so far, very inspired by Robocraft and obvious where it borrowed from its progenitor. But that does not make it a bad game by any means.The building is decent, but not hugely important. There is simply not enough depth to the building -yet- to make it matter much. The combat is very engaging and the ground work for a solid damage system are there, but as the building doesnt matter much yet so doesn't careful targeting. On the flip side, you can make a really cool looking ship without sacrificing much in the way of power/toughness.The weapons need a lot of work though... the game is currently a snipe fest. Everyone uses the big cannons and stays back at max range just pinging at each other. Few ships are well enough designed and piloted by skilled enough people to zip in and fight up close/mid range but they are still inferior to the large cannon cruiser/battleships in general. They have a tough uphill journey to balancing their weapons and creating better counter play.Over-all.... the game is worth giving a try. If you like it, throw a little $$ the developers way to keep growing the game. This is very much in the same boat Robocraft is, what they are trying to do is truly epic, very hard to balance, and requires  strong community support to pull off. These guys are not 3xA developers and with no major Publishers backing them. They are making a great product and need a dedicated communities help to not only fund it but also test and balance it.This, as with Robocraft, has the potential to be one of the best multiplayer online games out there and far far exceed the 3xA big money games. So give it a try!"

A bit of fine tuning and it will be a great game.My issues are, its really unbalanced, no moderation in the chat and the matches arent long enough.Ship building takes me back to Kingdom Hearts in a good way. Keep working and Iron out the bugs and it will be good. But at the moment, I cant recommend."
76561198051668679,Not Recommended,562590,29475894,Posted: 24 January,all,Daelore,"So I'll give an honest opinion about this game...1. Snipers are too strong, they can completely tear you apart in a few shots.2. Snipers also don't travel very far from spawn meaning IF you manage to get through the enemy team and avoid said snipers fire, he's just going to spawn up and remove you.3. Rockets, phasors or cannon is really the only way to go... you have to aim everything but why should I restrict myself to trying to lead in this game when rockets are so much better? The machine guns are TERRIBLE.4. No regen so if you get your stuff shot out... even though you won the fight... you have to press K and suicide giving the enemy a point anyway.5. Maps are too small and too big at the same time. All the terrain you can take cover behind is limited to such a small space, yet you can fly out of that to rediculous lengths making that annoying flankers capable of just riding the edge into your spawn, then fly behind your spawn and never get spotted by your team.6. Progression is so painful. It take quite a few games of 2x exp with a 225% increase on the match to get enough junk to research one thing.7. Matchmaking is broken. I was seeing ships much larger and much more well equipped than I early game. Indestrucible badasses just taking on level 3 rookies.8. Since snipers are so powerful, this makes games focused around a few pillars, with snipers daring anyone to peek meaning if you are a close ranged damage dealer, you better be able to take on their entire team.This game HAS potential but right now it just lacks the balance for me to recommend this to anyone."
76561198166938141,Not Recommended,562590,29421372,Posted: 22 January,all,Death the Dried Cow Fetus,"Gauss Cannon Artillery League more like it haha. In all fairness I really like the customizability of ships, but the weapons and ship classes are terribly imbalanced. All of these Gauss Cannons bring back PTSD of the R8 in CS: GO. You can't get anywhere close to the enemy without being sniped from nearly halfway across the map. That basically leaves you with the choice to either use Gauss Cannons and artillery mode on your ship to have a fair (albeit rather bland) fight, or be a flying target that no amount of armor can protect. There are so many cool weapons and ship classes in this game; to make one of them so OP that the others are irrelevant makes it a lot less fun."

,Recommended,562590,29590488,Posted: 30 January,all,Pristine Sadness,"A fun and more enjoyable alternative to Robocraft!After playing this game for a while, I discovered one thing:This game is one of the most addicting games I've played in a long time!Let's take a look at some Pro's and Con's:Pro's:Very easy to use editor, but sadly, the hotbar is very small.You dont have to buy anything more than once. You buy it for a sorta high price, and you can use it as much as you want.The crafts control feels very good, it doesn't feel like youre sliding all over the place.The Noob-Ship class doesn't feel underpowered at all. Of course, the specialised classes are better, but you can easily take down a shielded Battleship with a beginner ship.No pay to win. Most ingame purchases are for skins only. The rest is Premium and ""Space Whiskey"" for more XP and Currency.Class-specific abilities are surprisingly well balanced for a 2 week-old game, which is something a lot of dev's struggle with at first.Con's:OMG the balancing is awful. Definetly something that has to be improved.As of right now, the Gauss Cannons are very overpowered, especially using the Destroyer class.The only gamemode so far is TDM, which is kind of a bummer, but I'm certain that that will change very quickly.Leveling up in the higher levels feels very slow to me personally, but in the end, it extends the fun, so it isn't necessarily that bad.Long story short, this game hooked me really quickly and i cant wait to see it take off, 'cause it has a lot of potential. I can't wait to see it develop and get more fun after every update! It's definetly more fun if you play it with friends though, cause you can attack more efficiently. It's also very addicting. I keep telling myself: ""just one more game and I'm done!"", but that mostly just ends in me playing through a whole night (which totally didn't happen to me last night).NOW GO! This game won't download itself ;D!"

But as a man who has spent nearly 3000 hours in rc and could probably write a book on how to develop a game into the ground based on what I have witnessed in the the three years I played rc.I guess what I am saying is this game so far has itched a scratch that no other game besides rc has and so far has done it well. Some things that are great about this game and I let you decide if it's any good.1. Unlimited amount of blocks, no pay wall or grind to get more simply unlock the modules with your in game credits and you can use as much as your cpu (game block count limit) will allow.2. No pay to get better things only pay to get cool looking skins and faster exp.3. Skins are AMAZING with custom animations and designs and everything.4. Very few bugs. (win 10, geforce laptop 900 series and intel cpu)6. More than just building the best craft, abilities and the effective use of them as well as knowing what abilities other craft have and map awareness can make almost any build work properly in Galactic Junk League.Now some few complaints:1. Placing blocks is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥sometimes.2. Current meta is kinda boring but not broken as a lot of people complain (IE sit near your own spawn and long range anything that comes near or the ever annoying fast ships with an high damage close range lasers. Think telsa from rc before they got nerfed. The current meta means you can use these close range ships but you'er better off using them to defend against enemy close range ships as armored slow craft can be killed easily with a player who knows what they are doing.With this I hope you give Galactic Junk league a chance. Lets hope the game succeeds and continues to be awesome. ~Jake"

Later level matches are very boring where its just long range sniping matches where if you get close in a smaller ship the big ships just use abilities to lock you down.

76561198361151700,Recommended,562590,30250812,Posted: 28 February,all,ThatGuysTooGood,"Galactic junk league is an early access game in which you build ships and destroy other ships with that ship, A pretty simple concept, for a pretty simple game. Theres nothing that stands out about this game but that still does not mean its not fun. In fact its actually a well made early access game that has some pontential. I'm going to start off with the problems I had with the game first. My first problem I had with the game was that the game limits you with your ship if you want to decorate or build anything cool like a star wars tie fighter or the star trek enterprise. Another one of my problems is the multiplayer, team auto balance is not that good and you leave the match when its over. One of my last problem is the ship movement. Your ship goes extremeley slow even with powerups enabled which is really anyoing if you want to get to the battle fast or get away from another ship thats shooting at you, but at the same time its an early access game so its not that big of a deal. My last problem is that you can only put one type of weapon on your ship, for example if I wanted to put missles and lasers on my ship I would not be able to do that. I dont really understand why they did that, but I can live with it. The stuff I really liked about the game though was that the editor, to make your ships, was easy to use, the cartoony art style was pretty cool, the controls were easy to use and I loved the battling because of how the peices of someones ship could just fall off and you could shoot someones weapons off and they would'nt be able to shoot there weapons which is really cool to me. So overall this is a decently good, free early access game that I really liked.I will probably keep playing and enjoying this game now and after the full version comes out and I am going to reccommend this game and give it game a 7 out of 10 :)"

But, i also think there isnt enought content. what would be cool in this game if there is like a universre to explore, with lots of planets and we can fight npc or work together with other playes. Last thing i dislike is the fact hat you can only have 1 weapon type per ship. That really sucks, as all ships have a disadvantage against other. Other then that, its a great start."

One would think that the developpers learnt something from it, but actually it has exactly the same flaws as Robocraft. Yay?Good stuff: Now fully 3d fast paced combat, controls are quite intuitive and the battle flows good.Also building a robot... Sorry, I mean, an ""space junk ship"" is quite satisfying... the first three times. Then its always the same stuff: battle, get some coins (or pay for them if you wish), unlock new skills and modules and repeat.But now let's be honest: How comes that you kept EXACTLY the same mechanics than in Robocraft?Do you want to build an all-purpose ship? NOP! You can only select one kind of weapon.Do you want to fully protect your ship? NOP! You are limited on the ammount of pieces you can add. Cheap mechanic as f(word). They could balace it so if you have a very heavy ship you will be slow, or loose power, or require more engines to actually keep flying... But Nop! Let's just limit the number of pieces you have!The battles are short. WAY too short.And, exactly as it happened in Robocraft, the players that have been playing longer are simply overpowered, so they will always lead the battle. Skill, you ask? Nop, simply better weapons and pieces.Sill you may enjoy this game for... let's say 2 hours? Maybe a game you want to have installed to play something while the good games get updated.Still free to play. I don't think much people would spend money on this.Only good thing I can actually say: This is still an early access. Maybe the developpers will lsiten to the reviews and actually make this an appealing game. As it is right now I expect a very short life for Galactic Junk League.UPDATE: It keeps getting better (sarcasm) with the ""buy credits"" option.So you unlock an upgrade, say for 3000 credits, right? Play a couple of games to get the credits.Immediatly as you get the credits you get a new upgrade to research. The price?12.000 credits.Do you want to have anything good in a reasonable time? Pay.

Except with an even less clear power ranking system (other games might call them teirs).There are few things more satisfying than to murder scores of opponents in your one masterfully designed ship (only to be brought down by the combined efforts of 7 enemies / half their team); to know that you are a better at designing and using your ships than nearly all others.  And there are virtually limitless possibility's in the skeleton, if not armament, of one's design - this allows for producing some incredibly exotic shapes.At the same time, this game is basically one continuous grind.  The truely best independent (not guide based) player designs only can be actually completed once you get your ship ranking up to a sufficiently high level due to CPU restrictions... and that sufficiently high level is often 10 to 15 levels above your current one.  It is highly like a itch to have (atleast) one garage slot dedicated to an incomplete, even unplayable in its current stage, design.This game is highly addictive, but also lacks any real way to keep the player interested for any extended length of time.  I reccomend this game for people who want to religiously kill 20 hours of their life over the course of 4-5 days and then move on to something else."

It's simple game mechanics like every other game, you find a style you like then you exploit the environment and your abilities to best support that style.I personally play a ship with high DPS, short weapon range, light armor, and low mobility. Do I get killed every time I try to approach a ship geared for long range combat? No, because I'm not a dumbass who flies straight at them in the open. I watch the team and as soon as I see the opportunity, I rush in and melt through 3 ships before they know what's going on.I've seen ships with missiles, gausse weapons, and lasers all be the top ship in matches(and ships with extremely heavy armor and no armor). If you're not doing well either find out how you can use what is available to you better or start from scratch and try something else.A little about the game, the matchmaking seems very balanced to me. What you do in the match easily decides who wins. In my experience 80-90% of my games are close enough that it could go to either team. If you've never played this type of game before, then you should try it to learn how pleasing it is to build a ship completely yourself and then perform well in it. It's extremely easy to learn and is fun the minute you get into a match - even in a rookie ship.For being EA and Free to Play I'd give this game at least a 9/10 at the time of this review. (And I'm not the type to just throw big numbers around because I like one thing)PS: It's fun as hell to make Eve Online ships. My friend made a Coercer that actually looked extremely similar and performed well in matches."

I feel very neutral towards it, for reasons being that it is a cute little gem that plays on being robocraft in space. But what it lacks is depth, balance, and goals.  While there is ship classes you can level and build around, there is almost no point, since Sniper ships are the god weapon of this game and win every game. That and the matches lack objectives, there is only Team Deathmatch and the team with the best sniper or most snipers wins. Most newbies don't even stand a chance sadly due to this and it can become very infuriating.However it is still considered an Early Access game, and at the time of this review, very new to Steam. So with that said, perhaps with more time and balance the dev's can shape this cute little gem to become a more longer lasting enjoyable experience. Also the ship customization could use some work, it is very flawed with designs being very one sided and FOTM style. If you don't follow a certain style you just gimp yourself."

There's no real variation on ships from what I can tell (Not that I can, being relatively new and all that.) All ships have thrusters, all ships have gyroscopes.

They had tracks, wheels thrusters, planes, helicopters blades, hover discs, walker legs which allowed for railgun scorpions. It was viable to make a main-battle tank in Robocraft due to the fact that you could continously stack layers of armor upon Itself of different levels of protection to protect against what you felt was the biggest threat. Plasma? Have weaker armor in front and thicker in back. Railguns? Thicker up front with a squishy interior usually worked, as long as you spaced out the squishy with strong blocks.SMGs giving you trouble? Making a varying layer of strong / weak / strong / weak would often ♥♥♥♥ up their day until you managed to kill them.If you wanted to make a flying carpetbomber, you could. If you wanted to make a wheeled, weak but extremely fast skirmisher, you could. That game used to leave all the choices up to the player of what they wanted to do, not go ""Well, you either do X or Y or you don't do anything at all.""I've no doubts that the developers of GJL will eventually fix all of these problems, and I sincerely hope they do, but until they do, I would not waste the time It takes to download and uninstall this game.

But because it's a game in development it does have some issues still.You can start by doing the short tutorial and build your own spacecraft to fight other players.Building your own ship starts very simple (with the Rookie class) and it gives you more options to expand upon as you level up in the game. At rookie level 10, you can access the other types of ships in the game and build all of those too, like a heavy weapons battleship or a fast moving frigate.Building ships is my favorite part of the game.You really have to think of a ship that fits to your playstyle and build it accordingly.After a few matches you might think of a way to make your ship better, or level up so you can add more stuff to it (like additional weapons or armor plating). It's fun to get creative with it (although that probably won't always make a great ship to fight with).As of now, the only gamemode is pretty simple; a PvP deathmatch arena with a few different maps. The outcome of the battle will reward you with experience in the class you are using and scrap to purchase upgrades.It could greatly benefit from some additional development time.The game still has some minor technical difficulties, for example lag and balancing issues where weapons range and distance in the game seems to be the most important factor to win at the moment (read: you will get sniped alot).Also levelling up classes and earning scrap goes ever so slowly which makes it frustrating as you cannot try out new things. Some more map variation and new gamemodes would be welcome.Hopefully nothing that can't be fixed in the near future!All in all the game is pretty straightforward and fun to play and that's why I recommend it."

This works in RPG type settings, but in an arena type game it gives too much power to people based solely on amount of time spent playing.Researching new modules etc to use is very difficult, and you must play through many games just to unlock the weapons that are more powerful, while not having access to comparable firepower to defend with.You'll spend your first several hours dying, or hiding in battles as you're completely outclassed regardless of skill level. Once you unlock new ship classes you'll be in a similar, but less disadvantaged state until you can earn enough to research the requisite modules to allow your class ship to actually function as a battleship etc.Conclusion: It's fun to play, but needs more game modes, which will hopefully come in time. Balance needs MAJOR work. As of writing as mentioned above you don't stand a chance against anything for your first several dozen matches regardless of your individual skill or ship design."

Customization menu is simple to use and there are plenty of combinations you can make, also, the amount of blocks and stuff you can put on your ship are decent, not too few nor too much.The gameplay is buggy, sometimes I came across situations where you almost totally destroy someone and he gets destroyed by another player in which case you walk away without an assist even tho you spent a lot of time fighting with him and you took massive amount of damage. That is the biggest problem and it is not rare, it is very commonOptimization is terrible as well, I have to reduce my resolution + details to play on 30-40 FPS with 8GB of ram, quad core athlon x4 840 CPU and Radeon R7 GPU while the minimum system requirements are Intel Dual Core, 4gb of ram and Intel HD 3000 graphics.Since the game is still being developed and it is free-to-play I have faith that in the near future these things will become history. Also as a FTP game it offers a lot without paying real cash for it. Most stuff you need cash for are special ships, which aren't much different than the usual and cosmetics, which are not essential for a decent gameplay.Overall: Worth downloading and spending some time on since it is pretty fun for people who want fast-paced action."

Instead of moving with the mouse you'll have to use eight keys to move in all 6 directions plus turn. The mouse only controls your camera and turrest. There should be a toggle for this. The speed and physics of the game is slow and sluggish, in a bad way. Colliding with asteroids makes you just bump and dogfighting is, well, what dogfighting? I've told you, you're a turret in space.Building mode is very simplistic and limited, just as everything in this game, and looks terrible. The design of the blocks is so bad that they do not even attach to eachother. My ship is a bunch of fugly uneven shaped boxes floating a few inches from eachother. I have no clue how to make those larger flat areas you see in the screenshots, but probably it's blocks you'll have to unlock through grind or dollars. I tried to make a vertical ship, but reached a building area restriction really fast.Macthmaking takes long time and after you've found a match you'll have to wait another minute, just because, before you actually enter the match. The match itself was so anticlimatic as it could be. A bunch of slow moving turrets shooting another bunch of slow moving turrets, and all of a sudden*pooff*, without any excitement you saw a scoreboard. Apparantly we won.The UI is cartoony and reminds you of the awful controlscheme everywhere, even if you've rebinded the keys. The whole game is cartoony and colorful, and you get no feeling of ""space"" at all.

It's definantly fun to make ships and just to see how they fair in arena battle. Sometimes the results are good, sometimes not so much.  New designs and fun ships are abound in everygame. Tactics are needed, but watching newer players just go in guns blazing in a poorly designed junk ship and blowing up in seconds is fun. to watch.

I'll come back and revamp the review in the future, but for now, I need to take a break.I've played this game for hours upon hours in it's pre-Steam beta. Most of that time was just spent blowing up PVE ships in test mode to try out a cool new ship I had just built. That's really the fun part of the game and still is. The multiplayer rounds in Galactic Junk League leave something to be desired, however.Other game have a much better ""feel"" to them. Perhaps it's atmosphere? Possibly ""community""? World of tanks, for instance, is also free to play but the rounds seem more lively. People chat, map gets ""pinged"" and tactics play a large role. Crossout, also has more of a lively feel to it, mostly because it has a very specific post-apocalyptic atmosphere.Galactic Junk League just has a ""meh"" atmosphere about it; a generic sort of sci-fi spceship feel, with very little communication taking place in rounds and almost no tactical approach to battles. Furthermore, the other games mentioned have a specific goal the teams work towards, other than blowing other people up, so you feel a reason to keep playing round after round. Star Trek Online does much better in most areas than this game, but you can at least design ships in this game, which makes it a bit different.GJL is ""young"" still and they have made progress with updating it; it hasn't stagnated in development for half a decade like other EA titles tend to do. For that reason, and the fact that it is at least a semi-original comcept with a sense of humor thrown in, I'm going to tentatively recommend it. You really just have to try it our for yourself to see if you like it. Besides that, it's price tag is at least worth a look!"

Unfortunately I can't see myself investing any real time in this game. So I won't see the full limits of this game.Actual game play, isn't terrible. Game area looks quite good but there's several buts...Frame rate seem a little poor.And once you get badly damaged the game becomes fawled. Point of game is first to 20 kills but if you do go into battle then you'll more than likely receive damage. Even if you kill your target. Problem is there's no way of recovering damage. Ego, there after if you don't want to die. Rhe only option left iIs to hide and do nothing. Or kill yourself so you can battle again.And then you've a long flight to rejoin the battle, for another 30 seconds of fun before starting again.I'm sure with enough hours/days/weeks/months you can increase your tech to last longer etc.However due to all it little issues I can see me lasting a week with this game.Good concept, hope devs improve game over time but at the moment.

When GJL first opened up on steam there were exactly two weapons in the entire game that were any good. Another was decent. Naturally, the developers began receiving from complaints from a very vocal minority of players who were unable to find a way to counter the strengths of those weapons. The developers response to this was not to improve the other weapons in the game. It has been to steadily break the only two good weapons in the game until they are equally as crappy as the rest. And since the developers are continuing to listen to the loudest players rather than the ones who are actually playing the game and know what they are doing you can expect that this trend will continue until this once beautiful jewel of a space sim/MOBA is nothing more than a scarred, crap covered piece of broken glass."

Also camping snipers isn't really the case why your team is losing. Ive played as a destroyer, using my awesome Uber Cannon, upgrading my fire range; some matches, enemies are dumb enough to be in my line of fire and I can simply one shot them. But some matches are pretty challenging, here comes a use of those strong and huge Battleships, big, and easy target, slow depending on their thrusters, but when they have tactical jump, thats when the panic happens. We destoyers are so vulnerable, either we get flanked by them, or those battleships make a good distraction for the Frigates and Cruisers to get behind and stab us. Its a very strategic game and I like it..It doesnt seem imbalanced to me. Just don't go full retard rushing by yourself. Observe the team, when everyone plays defense, you should probably too because no one will back you up. Not all matches go by your pace!Also, to the developer, I do wish to see all my ship classes' level, to keep track on my gamestyle and pace without having to spare an empty ship slot just so that I can look at levels.

Good F2P setup, no P2W ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.You start in a rookie ship, and then at level 10 you can build a ship from one of 4 classes:  Frigate, Destroyer, Cruiser, and Battleship.Every class is useful and has abilities and traits unique to it. Frigates are fast and small, useful for intercepting and stunning bigger ships.  Destroyers are basically mobile turrets which can have bonuses to defense and range while sitting still.  Cruisers(my personal fave) are medium sized and have support and debuff abilites.  Battleships are lumbering behemoths bristling with guns and armor.The only thing I can say about balance is that at the time of this review, Guass cannons are pretty ridiculous and dominate the meta.  However, the devs have already said that they see the problems and are doing a balance patch in the next few days, so thumbs up to the dev team for staying on top of things and listening to the player base.Give it a try.  Definitely gives off some of those early Robocraft vibes."

Robocraft also has 50x the amount of pieces of content. Robocraft also plays a bit smoother, but its hardly noticeable. You feel like you are flying a freighter in this. That being said, Robocraft has several flaws that make Galactic Junk League Better.  GJL chooses to go for a inked in aethetic similiar to Borderlands and others, which to me at least is more interesting than the visuals in Robocraft. Parts are very limited, but all building parts you can get from game currency earned by playing. Parts in Robocraft are behind microtransactions and 100s of dollars of DLC. Also the best weapons are bought, which makes Robocraft pay to win. There are balancing issues in GJL, but the devs even acknowledged the issues with snipers and are working on it. There are microtransactions, but they are for aethetic skins, and exp/currency boosters for playing games. Which in my opionion is totally fine. Put money in and support the devs and you will progess quicker. That being said, they don't hide any peices needed to build or win behind paying. The tutorial was also more user friendly then Robocraft and the narrator character added some charm. The game has character. Lets hope the Devs keep up thier integrity, and other parties don't intervene. A lot of f2p games built up communities just for the devs to change the system to pay 2 win, or another party takes over and kills the game balancing. I expected to play it for a bit and delete it like robocraft when I downloaded it.

I like the freedom to make as serious or as silly a ship as I can. Controls are basic, but easy to use. Matchups are random as can be, and yes, you will run into a lot of unfair matchups, but that's kind of the price for a free to play.I look forward to new options as the game develops past beta."

76561198058051839,Recommended,562590,29406203,Posted: 21 January,all,Priestly,"Now that connection issues seem to have been largely sorted, this is actually a fun game.The ability to design your spaceship from scratch results in a lot of interesting possibilities and wacky entertainment.One thing I do have to question is the matchmaking system. I understand wanting to limit queue times and therefore would expect some variance in ship strength but at the moment it's just completely ridiculous. Just had a game where the entire enemy team was destroyed by a single ship on our team which had maxed out hitpoints and damage as well as a ton of abilities. The guy had 14 kills by the end of the game and it left very little to do for either the remainder of our team or the enemy team, most of whom were piloting rookie ships. Would much prefer waiting a tad longer if it meant rookie ships were matched up against other rookie ships for one. A somewhat more extended tutorial and more elaborate single player campaign would also be highly beneficial as what is present right now is extremely basic.An option to reset your account would also be extremely desireable. Research costs (which give you access to new building blocks and items for your ship) are prohibitive to the point where if you research the wrong thing early on, you're going to be stuck with a subpar ship for dozens of games afterwards which is just needlessly frustrating.Overall the game definitely has potential but at the moment the main enjoyment for me comes from the ship design rather than the actual matches. Still worth a try though."

It is like robocraft but better but.. i find it toooo simple i hope they make it more complex and difficult also i wish it to be skill based. If this game stays empty gamers like myself will easily get bored of it and the game might die in 1 or 2 months from now.Pretty Game for F2p

Build your own ship from a good variety of parts and go into the arena and fight! The beauty of this one is in it's simplicity. It's Free to play, what do you have to lose? Give it a shot!"
,Recommended,562590,29415400,Posted: 21 January,all,Hanzo Main,"I've been having fun playing the game, yes, but that doesn't mean there aren't rough edges.Pros:The building is very fun and intuitive. Very similar to Besiege and From the Depths and others like it, but not as much depth or complication as those two.Combat, when you get a good match up, is satisfying. Grouping up in a squadron and punishing lone wolf enemies feels great.Flying the ship may feel sluggish or slow, but that is usually the player's fault; add gyroscopes and thrusters or cut weight. This is where much of where the balancing went right; it's difficult to build a truly 'over powered' ship, as you will lack in one area or another, be it fire power, maneuverabilty, utility or armor.Cons:The balancing feels very poor in terms of weapon design, especially with how open the maps are and how player spotting is handled. You will know where virtually everyone on the map is at any given moment. Flanking is hardly an option as the game tells you where almost everyone is at all times, except for a few seconds when they fly close to a wall. Which would be fine, except...Longer range weapons will trounce shorter range weapons 9/10 times. This is where a lot of your frustration at lower levels will be. Gauss cannons and cruise missiles will shred you long before you even get within range of the enemy with them if you dared to use the weapons with sub 3000 meter range (which is all you have for the first few hours), and the devs think the solution to this is to tell us to go flank (see above).And while not obvious at first glance, one glaring issue is voice communication. The game lends itself to teamwork but how can you really do that when you would have to stop and type to your team. This could be difficult due to how diverse the playerbase is but it would be a great help.Also, by nature of being free, the game is loaded with micro transactions, but they are just cosmetic. Anything that actually effects gameplay can be won over time but it still makes it feel a little pay to win.Over all, I'm giving the game a positive review because I feel it has a ton of potential and the issues can be relatively easy to fix. The concept is solid and the building is great, the issues lie mainly in some minor balancing tweaks."

Have see how the Game was step-by-step build up with the Replys of the Basic Players and the DEVs. It was a hamony time between what players hope to see and what DEVs have plan to do.At the early fights there was a lot of Bugs, Glitches, and other Problems, but all (most) are gone and we can start now to lift the Game a class higher.Sure, some Reviews tell us that a missing MatchMaker and a OP Weapon actually ruin the Gaming Fun, but I am sure, the DEVs will fix this ASAP, as before in closed status.Here every Player should have a test by himself by building small (up to big) flying Trash-Cans with his own Phantasy and less Power. Then start to grow up in Experience, Ship Classes, Weapons, Team-/Game-Play and building true dirty weapon stare Monsters of Space Ships.My review so far for the actual status is:pro:- free to build own phantsy Ships (+forms)- most is use for free (not Pay to win)- very easy Tutorial and help to learn movments & how to build ships- main language is english (better as russia or chines etc. ), but other are possible.- mostly friendly Players who help newcomers in- Very helpfull and friendly Support and that they really listen to players  (only 5% of Devs do it at other Games where the money rules)- Grafic is getting better and better with every update.contra:- missing MatchMaker- only 1 Part of OP Weapon for the higher Classes- sometimes the Game eats complete RAM of older Machines, or stutter by to much fast PC during a battle (who steal the power of older machines too)- need much more active Players to get a good workout for a working MatchMaker etc.- download & install via Steam is buggy. Some need to download the Game-Installer via the Link above directly by the DEVs PageSo far the DEVs do a great job.just my 2 centscheers"

Epic graphics and high quality♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sadly, It requires good FPSEDIT: What i meant is; The game is really high quality, and reminds me of a game that sadly got killed by updates, and  brings back the fun of it. and this requires a good computer to handle the gameplay, since my first multiplayer match was a laggy hell, i hope there will be upcoming graphics updates, allowing to make the graphics even lower."
