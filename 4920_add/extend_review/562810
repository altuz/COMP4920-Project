,Not Recommended,562810,34905165,Posted: 12 September,all,BBQSauce,"I've put hundreds of hours into Ubisofts version of Monopoly. Easily the best looking Monopoly out there - but major game breaking issues that were present on the Xbox and PS4 versions since it came out in November 2014 still exist. That's almost 3 years.The game will inexplicably stop proceeding at random points during the game. The game won't be frozen, but none of the players will be able to take the next turn.I've reported this to the developer, Asobo, and also to Uplay with previous version. But nothing's gotten done.Being the glutton for Monopoly that I am, I've been able to limit this happening by making sure everyone who I play with on the Xbox/PS4 has a wired connection to their router (I strongly feel they did not test this game using Wifi connected devices). And I'm leaning towards this being the issue here as well. Haven't been able to test this with the PC version yet. Not sure I'm motivated to waste the time of 5 other people.I love the team at Ubisoft, and strongly believe this has the potential to be a huge success on Steam and Uplay. But as it is right now, it's tremendously irresposible to sell this with the same game breaking issues that have been there for years. Please invest the resources need to fix this game. I'm personally happy to help duplicate the issues and get this sorted.This could be the definitive version of Monopoly online with just a bit more love."

What a shame that this amazing game is ruined by a lazy port and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ development. Also this game uses denuvo which is aids and is why there is a lot of mp bugs.

Me and my friends bought the game and were like ""Monopoly? 3d? thats lit"" this game just was a joke, it was entertaining just to see the dice roll and sit there for 30 minutes waiting for the next turn, never happened waited a day no update, get with it ubisoft find a fix asap or the bad reviews are gonna keep coming. 3/10."

,Not Recommended,562810,34825675,Posted: 8 September,all,PeterSvP [BG],"Unfortunately the game is filled with bugs that if Ubi did proper QA they would fix.BUGS:Online games simetimes stall.Bottom bar sometimes is overdrawn with other actions.If frame rate is slow, UI Event processing sometimes did not catch.Input with mouse does ""release"" sometimes without actually the button being released.If I am playing with mouse, the GAMEPAD is vibrating when my turn arrives and the entire household hears this. I even jumped out of scare from the noise when gamepad vibrates on wood surface.GAME BREAKING BUG: Sometimes, you JUST CANNOT BUILD HOUSES AND HOTELS!!!!!!!IF a bot tries to build and above bug is in action, the game stalls.Exiting the game with Alt+F4 is instant during game.Exiting the game with Alt+F4 does NOT restore my monitor gamma ramp and color calibration, so I have to run the Calibrate Display Color Dialog again.(Why the game even bothers to change them in first place?)PROs:The only one is that the game have multiplayer.And that is is beautiful.Similar games that I recommend:Rento Fortune - paid cheap, has real multiplayer, AND has players! It's very ugly, but runs on your toasters, and has some very nice featuresBusiness tour - free, good looking chill pixel art, but I've encountered trolls. And have microtransactionsSimilar games that I DON'T recommend:The official old Monopoly game.@Ubisoft, your potntially BEST game is in extremely unshippable state yet. The quality is indeed lower than. Hasbro won't be happy with this.Refunded. Sorry.Petar Petrov,Professional Game Developer"

,Not Recommended,562810,34825183,Posted: 8 September,all,Anal Mayonaise,"This game has been out for years (outside of Steam), and virtually none of the complaints players have had time and time again have been addressed. In particular, this game does NOT allow for AI in online multiplayer sessions, and it does NOT allow for drop-in players. Furthermore, the game performance is AWFUL even on high end computer set ups.Honestly, the last version on Steam,Monopolyis far better despite lacking online multiplayer. At least that version had AI in (offline) multiplayer and let you customize the rules to a much greater extent than this version. My friends have more fun playing the last version online via screenshare than playing this version with its native multiplayer features.Oh, and the ""Living Board"" is complete and total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  It's the exact same board as the original with the exact same rules, only with an animated living city in the middle to cripple the game's performance."
