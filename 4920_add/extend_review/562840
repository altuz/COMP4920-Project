Note - I actually played this game in a browser and not through steam because this game seems to crash on steam every few minutes.typical chinese browser mmorpg brough to steam to try to get you to buy their various ""packs"" for a few bucks.graphics are what you expect from a free browser game, theres no strategy, theres no real task other than clicking.again, its free - try it for youself if you have NOTHING else to do..."

So you can leave the game running while you do rl or other stuff.At this point however it is getting absolutely ridicoulus. Not only is this game the absolute pinnacle of P2W, its almost P2Play, every 5 level (from 179) you unlock another thing that costs premium money (which you only get by paying) everyone of those LARGELY increases your power.You literally need 100s of dollars to even have a chance to do the activities ingame, because of this the player base is also very small (~300 players).There are a lot of other things that are just plain bad, the performance is atrocious for a flash game. It will literally goble up one whole core of your cpu and an ungodly amount of RAM due to the money memory leaks and unoptimized programming.All in all: Don't waste your time with this♥♥♥♥♥♥.."

Well anyway im lvl 30, yep, barley an hour in and im lvl 30, with the same three skills but are stronger and might be able to learn otheres(at this rate, I might have to be like 60 before seeing new skills)Although I did enjoy some of the old school asetic, I didn't really feel emereced in the story...spoilers.... ""hold on, Im a what that did stuff then ended up with the Gods so I have to learn everything again?"" Also...being able to not only fight Zeus but beat him multiple times(he does get tougher but still....why should I be able to casually get into a play fight with Zeus to ""learn something"" was there no one else around? No demigod to train with instead so the gods can be awesome and not feel like ""I have to beat Zeus again....well this might take a few more turns"") Oh....and story wise Im some one with dragon blood...which apprantly makes me chummy enough with Zeus for him to be my punching bag a few timesokay let me stop bashing that for a moment, its just for me gods should have a clear purpose for interacting with them, or at least a feeling of...well something awesome, which is lacking here....totally killed it for me...speaking about interactions....I dont want to see a fairy saying ""click here to continue"" for every time I needed to click on a dialog box to keep the conversation going...Okay so you clearly see some of my beef, let me say some good things, after all there are human beings at work here....I DO like how I DONT need to know who I am exactly talking too, there is an autopilot that will take me to whoever I need to talk to, so no time having to look through old quests for names, or even looking at people's head to try to find so and so, I get lost easily so I liked that aspect...now for me to turn it offthe dungeon system is GREAT! Just simply click on dungeon and pop in whenever you want! just costs stamina which regenerates, no hassle to get from where ever I am to the dungeon I need to crawl so I can lvl up my party.(NPC's join you to make up your party by the way)Combat ratings are reasonable, I have a clear idea of what constitues a three star rather then a single star...long story short, speeed, which when I got 2 star rating intstead of three by ONE TURN that is legitamatly my fault...one move diffrent and I could have done it...which I did go back in order to complete, which of course gives you goodies as you go along, encourages you to use your skills wisely, as most of them consume rage you need to manage which ablities you want to use to optimize just how fast your going to kick their butt... Execpt for when the ""Random target"" happens to kill someone that someone in your NPC party could have killed in their sleep...so that sort of ruins the idea...would have been intresting if they did it rightwhich unfortuatly inculdes gods(more specifically Zeus)....and other random things like Hoplites, preists, dragon thingsSo I DO like the combat ratings that encourage tactial thinking, but a lack of skills/ablities to keep things intresting(though I will say some are epicly named) and a rage meter to keep track of in order to USE some of the more usefule ones prevents me from spamming my most powerful ablities all the time create the atmosphere where just using a basic sword swipe can be a good move, to preserve rage for something else later to get a three star rating...timing is essentialBut I feel the HUD is WAAYYY to cluttered with all of these shiny buttons(which I am almost surprised the fairy isn't telling me to press...the 1st few times were fine, getting introduced to an upgrade mechanic I can understand the need...but to keep dialoge going? Sorry...its annoying after a while...also like half of those buttons were to get me to spend real money)So long story short then...there are a few intresting ideas, but needs more story(chracters are introduced randomly so I dont really care....I think one preistess at the start was a freind of my hero or something and I left that level as confused as to who I am then when I started and well...lvl 30 and no clue who I am? I start not to care...I shouldn't NOT CARE about characters...including the annoying fairy) and TRIM DOWN THE HUD! put all the money stuff in one place instead of 5 diffrent buttons would ya?"

,Not Recommended,562840,29734542,Posted: 5 February,all,Finaltidus,"This is a pretty standard browser/mobile style game and while some of them are good this one is not. The biggest issue is how the premium currency works. In most games like this you have Gold, Premium Currency, and ""Free Premium Currency"". In other games you earn the ""Free"" version slow, and while it doesn't work on everything it does work on most. In this game you earn the ""Free"" version slow but the worse part is you can't even spend it on anything useful. I was actually stuggling to find anything useful at all with it. It is so bad in fact entire portions of the game are locked out unless you spend the Premium version. In other games u can at least ""get your feet wet"" in all the different upgrades and paths. Unless you plan on dumping money into it I wouldn't recommend. DO NOT PLAY THIS IF YOU DON'T PLAN ON SPENDING REAL $$$. Many other games just like this are out there that are much more fair to f2p players."

76561197964769882,Recommended,562840,29642362,Posted: 1 February,all,SoBaDStrange,"This game is semi-afk with plenty of dailies and hot events. It provides lots to do from dungeons, quests, side quests, and an active rpg/level/gear system also a multiplayer tower and guild war. Although it clearly has several in your face pay to win elements it is incredibly entertaining as a second screen game. It also has retro style mini games such as a coin drop with magnets/bonus time/bombs and a treasure hunting mini game with active elements and a roulette wheel. Highly recommend to play on a free and casual basis. Top lvl at time of posting is lvl 43 with Battle Power 13k. I am lvl 31 with battle power 5k non vip. Just play for two hours and see if you enjoy it. Chers."

I liked that the game has a wide diversity of pets.Besides, the game has a very useful feature - the autopilot. Especially helpful if you want to absent himself for a short time or if you can not find the character in the game world.The game is undemanding, it will work even on weak computers.A good game for those who want to relax and unwind."

I just started to play, but those sexy characters are awesome xDIt's very helpful that your recruits give you rage points too, cuz stashing it by yourself would be too boring. AFK system in quests and battles are very useful if you play from work, cuz it gives you more freedom to direct your real time. The only thing which confuses me is what the recruits gain their levels too slow. But I think that in the future this system will be realized better. Will see."
