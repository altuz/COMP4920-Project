,Not Recommended,563340,30149463,Posted: 24 February,all,Mr Torgue High-Five Flexington,"Inability to go fullscreen and slow pacing will likely put you off this game.There are a lot of Hidden Object games that do it right, sadly this isn't quite one of them.I have Windows 10, and considering the release date for this game is listed as 2016, I consider it a significant failure of the developers to not support fullscreen gameplay. For those of us with huge screen resolutions this can be a significant turn-off as the game window will be tiny and can cause eye strain. We shouldn't have to force our monitors to a lower resolution.While there is some great scenery, especially the intro where you are sent to the past, it is marred by the slow pacing and somewhat sluggish wait times for actions. The music got repetitive fast too, possibly fuelling my sleepiness. So by about a quarterway into the game I just wanted it to be over.H/O scenes typically take the form of finding a list of items (some requiring additional action to reveal), or finding matching pairs based on their similarities (eg. a gold apple with a real apple, a needle with a spool of thread), ending with a short description of the final, useful item you want to find from the scene. It's a refreshing take on finding items in that you aren't told specifically what you are looking for, or simply handed the random item like other H/O games sometimes do, there is some working-it-out-for-yourself involved.Unfortunately the story isn't great either. Voodoo mixed in with native Americans didn't make much sense to me, and I didn't understand why the Black Wizard (the evil guy of the game) was a voodoo doll running around pushing things over and stomping on things. Also, you bring all these friends over in the start and later you find them all sleeping in cupboards and wardrobes... maybe they had a booze-up hide-n-seek party while the protagonist was in the past.One thing I love about other H/O games is collectibles and extras. ... Can you guess?! This game has ... none.The gameispossible to finish, I didn't encounter any game-destroying bugs - but there is one area transition that seems to always want to crash the game. Thankfully this isn't an issue as the game saves with transitions anyway, and upon reloading it will work correctly.This mixing bowl of native americans, giraffes, meerkats and voodoo does indeed lack some spices, or perhaps it needs to go back in the oven. It has the makings of a good game, but ends up being just another game, like a cake with no icing. It needssomething more."
,Not Recommended,563340,30068342,Posted: 20 February,all,~✿Blissy✿~,"I""m surprised there isn't one review and honestly I""m not sure how this works so not even sure this one will show up.The reason for this review being negative isn't because I didn't enjoy the game.I actually liked the game and was having fun playing until it was unplayable due to you can't finish the game because of the huge flaw in the game play design of it near the end of the game.What makes this a game not to purchase is that the developers designed this game so that an essential item you need to finish the game that is used way before near the end of it simply disappears because you use it on a previous task, leaving you stuck at a crucial part near the end of the game because you can't find another source for this item or way to get it back without starting completely over.This means if you find this out after you been playing the game you already invested a lot of time and can't finish the game.This may be a game I come back in the future just to see if the solution I found is doable considering if you mess up again your stuck in starting over again however why would I want to start all over again any time soon having just played it over a couple of days ( I don't usually play a game through in one session and play times will reflect me leaving games active even if not playing at the moment) having to search and discover a solution only because I found a random post online explaining what we have to do in order to complete the game.if you do have this game or want to get it read  the game discussions here  on steam first because I posted how to get around this issue in the game.  I haven't tested it out but maybe in the future will.I don't know why when games I would think are usually tested by the developers and even later sometimes problems are found and they create a patch or update to correct them that this game hasn't been looked into but why have a game for sale one can't even finish :cdisappointed and  since my playtime is well over 2hrs before I even encountered this issue no chance of requesting a refund from steam, though it was on sale I would be asking for my $3.35 back due to unable to finish the game. :c"

You had to be really exact where you place objects, but when it's like a wet broom in tiny version and you're told to click on the trunk in hint... obviously you click on the trunk.... not according to the game, you actually need to click on the right branch!!! Then I get back to the house from the savannah area the game kept crashing with fatal errors. Just don't bother even wasting your time and money on this one."

The worst part was the beginning, it was really strange and you just bumped into it. The story in general was good and there were also very difficult puzzles to solve. Also the graphics were cool and there was a gloomy atmosphere. The ending was too short but still okay. I wouldn't buy the game at full price because it isn't that worth, but when there is a sale, then you can buy it without hesitation."

The story is original, the atmosphere is good, the backgrounds and scenery is pretty and the puzzles are varied  in idea and difficulty. I don't even have any real complaints other than the ending being a bit lame."

Some puzzles are much too easy, some don't seem at all logical and some are just tedious (the Skip button is becoming very useful), and basically you do stuff when you see there is something you can do, whether or not you understand why you're doing it. Also, one hidden object scene instructed me to pick an item I need to return to a gate when I had not even seen the gate in question yet. How are you supposed to pick the item? Clicking everything randomly, of course. I suppose I'll play this through, bit by bit, but I'm not expecting it to get any better. I cannot recommend this, so I'll have to vote No, although something in between would be more accurate."

The potential of cursed manor, ghosts and voodoo was wasted. I like HOP games, but this one just bored me. Despite the description, there are no trading cards for the badge (hope it will be fixed in the future).On the bright side, pleasant music, HO scenes are little more diversified than usual, but not much, the concept is interesting.It is not a bad game, but it is not a good one either."

It's got very little of the charm, the font looks crappy, and the pictures of the items are often too small to see. There are much better out there."
,Recommended,563340,29531925,Posted: 27 January,all,Kitten Morag,"I recommend this game with a few cons weighing against it.PROS:The puzzles are in depth, complicated without being infuriating, and they fit well with the theme of the storyThe graphics are really good and the voice acting isn't terrible.CON:The story is hokey as heck.The Native American and Voodoo imagery are very inappropriate.If you can handle the story being terrible, then this game is worthwhile. Probably pick it up on special or in a bundle though."

Some of the puzzles were too easy.  Others didn't have clear instructions so I just skipped those.  The graphics were good.  I played on a Win 7 pc, so I didn't have problems running the game.  The story was really weird. I didn't like the beginning. I was waiting for my cards to drop or I might not have played past it. The ending wasn't bad, but it kinda scared me though.  When I got to the end, my first though was ""Oh god, don't tell they are making a part 2"".  I would recommend only if it is really, really cheap or if you have a severe love of HOGs."

,Not Recommended,563340,29166558,Posted: 10 January,all,Crunch,"I could almost recommend this game. The story was interesting. You inherit a cursed house and must work to remove the curse. It does start off a bit odd with a trip back in time, but once you get back to 'now' the story gets more interesting.The puzzles weren't too hard, although some of the objectives weren't too clear. Although it might've been easier if I wasn't one of those people who refuses to read the help text. So for me there was lots of random clicking to see what things do, and in one case I was instructed to find something in the picture that I had no clue what was because I hadn't visited the location in the game where the thing goes yet. But no penalty for misclicks or anything so I just guessed.The game only took me just over 4 hours to finish, so I'm glad I got it on sale.Biggest problem I had with this game was I suffered a couple of Fatal Errors while I was playing, requiring me to relaunch the game to continue. Seemed to do it at points where it autosaved, so I rarely lost any progress. Though in one case it set me back about five minutes of play time. Not too bad, but still annoying to have to repeat steps I'd already taken.Overall, if there hadn't been those gamestopping Fatal Errors, I might've been confident recommending this game to some HOG players for the interesting story alone, but getting dumped out of the game randomly makes me hesitant to do that."

Plus, somehow I got the game confused and could not complete it - some items were removed from my inventory before I used them in all places (lighter).Nice graphics though.There are better in this genre."

,Not Recommended,563340,33922904,Posted: 31 July,all,shadree,"I finished this game in 2 sittings because it was torture the first time around.My mistake was to play it on Expert which meant (almost) pixel-hunting for interactive objects.If it wasn't for the map and the hint system, it'd have been a nightmare. Pity that on a few occasions, the map doesn't tell you what's next.This game also falls victim to not knowing what to do next, checking the map and finding a HO scene.Also, the ending was creepy and disappointing."
76561198300793514,Not Recommended,563340,35089516,Posted: 20 September,all,Tomator666,I invested 5 hours into this game before a major bug made it impossible for me to continue. I missed to pick up black chalk from the crypt (many items are much too hard to see btw) and now I can't go back.A huge disappointment...Oh and the game crashes approximately every 60 minutes.
