76561198086405565,Recommended,563750,28457620,"Posted: 18 December, 2016",all,Draa,"This game is a hidden gem on Steam.Let me start by saying I'm not a fan of the Steam review system. Quite often you see reviews from people with less than 1 hour in a game and whether positive or negative there's just no way that review is accurate. There's also the possibility of abuse and I think most of us have seen that as well. It's just not a trustworthy way of knowing whether a game has value or not. Playtime versus Price. That's the best way to judge a game imo. As you can see from my hours played this game has that in abundance.World Boxing Manager is a simple yet addictive, old school feel, text based game. It's not easy to understand when you begin but it's not that difficult to figure out before long. It doesn't have shiny graphics or anything 3D. It's not going to set the world on fire either and I'll admit, I doubted the game when I began playing. For $5 I figured it wouldn't be that good and that carried over into the first couple of hours playtime. I was wrong. It's a really good game and it's certainly worth the price being asked.If I had one complaint it would be the lack of a tutorial, but that's certainly not enough reason to dislike the game. It has a ""Help"" page but it's lacking. Other than that the game really doesn't have any glaring flaws. The fight engine is excellent. The training system is good. The matchmaking system is good. The marketing system is excellent. The fight instructions are good and seem to work properly. All in all everything works great for a text based game. The biggest problem is those things aren't explained very well on the Help page. Hopefully Aggroblakh will address this issue but either way, everything functions well once you understand how they work and it makes for a lot of fun.Anyway, I believe WBM is well worth the small price being asked. For $5 it's a steal. Thanks, and good gaming."
76561198062265037,Recommended,563750,31427190,Posted: 28 April,all,AlterEgo45,"I'd bet the farm that this game is written in Visual Basic 6. All of the controls look like stock issue - no user changes whatsoever. There is almost 0 artwork, no sound, and no music. Anyone who has something of a background in programming and a liking for strategy games will open World Boxing Manager and say to themselves, ""Wait a minute.... I've written something like this before"", or ""I could write something like this"".BUT... this is an excellent game. It is well balanced and well thought out. There are no bugs at all that I've seen. The replay potential is probably endless. When your boxer is getting hammered, you can look at the numbers and style of your guy vs your opponent and figure out what the problem probably is. You might not be able to fix that problem if the talent gap is too big, but you know why things are happening and there is no black box. The interface could be tighter and it's not immediately apparent how to succeed (hint: use marketing), but those are the only issues I had.So this, right here, is a prime example of why a developer who likes to play his own games, understands what makes a game balanced and fun, and puts TLC into his work is much better than a developer who might have better technical skills, an artist, and a sound guy helping out, but who doesn't have that same understanding of what makes a game replayable or fun.I'm glad to see something like this on Steam, and I'm glad the audience seems to get it. I hope more stuff like this hits the shelves."

Of course not, for the price, but it's addictive as hell and a very solid game. A few bells and whistles, improve the UI, and make it a tad more immersive and this is an A plus. This is great for fans of Front Office Football, OOTP, etc, and doesn't take a back seat to any of them, just needs a little more polish. This guy has a bright future and I'm gonna watch what he does next. Thanks for a great game that can only get better. rock solid."

With some more patches and improved UI e.g. better display of data without having to goto 2 different screens.  This will be legend.  The fight engine seems pretty solid.

76561198032926732,Recommended,563750,30599686,Posted: 18 March,all,Key,Probably the most indepth boxing manager game I have come across with a developer who is continually improving the game and taking on ideas (very refreshing)Still a few UI things that need improving that will vastly improve it and also there are various features with training and sparring that could be improved but overall it is an excellent little game and the developer is underselling himself pricing it at just £3.99 in my view!One thing that I would like to see looked at is something a bit more substantial on the financial/ gym / equipment side of things.  Once you have bought everything (which you can do pretty quickly) money actually becomes completely irrelevant.

Relative to the price its a great buy, considering its an indie developer that has been actively working on the game in response to feedback its a great buy, relative to all the rubbishy 'sim/manager' games out there its a great buy.For £4 its hard to complain, i feel like i find one of the hidden gems among all the crap out on steam."
76561198035763897,Recommended,563750,28299087,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,VictoryRpg,"I enjoy the game, I think that there is too much downtime in the early game though, and the fighter's themselves could be a bit more dynamic.   The fight engine is fairly strong ,there are perhaps too many uppercuts and rear-hooks from the outside but the tactics and damage system are interesting.  It is somewhat difficult to follow which fighter is being more effective from just the PBP though.I think that having more starting options, level of starting prestige or funds, and more customization during gym creation, the addition of gym traits of some kind for example, would be beneficial.Also, if a fighter is two pounds over at the day of weigh-ins, they can cut that through water, and even if they don't the whole fight will likely not be scrapped."

,Recommended,563750,35209605,Posted: 25 September,all,the_rock0123,"I’ve been a fan of sports management sims for a while, especially contact sports of wrestling and boxing. The first game that introduced me to text/database sims in this genre is Total Extreme Wrestling (a fantastic game series, available on Steam) and I also have experience with text based Gladiator game Elysium: Blood Games.  This game stacks up highly against these.  The excitement of the Mayweather Jr vs McGregor hype got me wondering what Boxing management sims are on steam.  I used to play Barry McGuigan World Championship Boxing released in 1985 on the ZX spectrum and hoped some game could rekindle the excitement of building up a boxer to fight for a World title.  I could only find this game as a serious contender so this game is an incredibly niche game for a specific niche target gamer and I have to say highly welcomed to even attempt a game in this genre.  That alone deserves support.Games like this can suffer from being too simple to be engaging and cheap games often suffer, in my experience, from poor tutorials and bad interface.  Happily, this game is both highly engaging and easy to understand.You start with a basic gym and equipment and attract students to train.  Your role as manager is to pit them in sparring against each other to try and assess if any have potential. When you spot a good student you can take them on as a trained fighter.  If there is no potential you can drop them from the gym.  You will need to hire a trainer and each trainer has specific traits and will work best with specific weights of boxer. The trainer only gets involved in fight preparation at a training camp.  When a fighter has no scheduled matches they will simply train in the gym alone or rest to recover strength and from injury. Your task is to search 100’s of boxers to find the ideal opponent that will challenge your boxer. With careful planning, you will get very few losses and a few KOs.  You don’t simply set a match up, but have to negotiate how much you are willing to “invest” in the fight, and whether you want the fight as a undercard for a event.  Later when your boxer is more than a “unknown” you can create main events and title fights.  BUT, it takes a LONG time to build up to that level (in fact, I haven’t got beyond “unknown” in 6 hours of enjoyable play). Once a match is set up you need to find a TV company willing to broadcast the fight and pay them a fee to host the event. You will get a share of the PPV revenues. There are 100’s of media companies to choose from and each company has specific audience sizes, specific regions, different values for marketing and hype.  It really depends what you want to achieve from the match what you go for – boxer marketability long term or money?Overall – it’s a huge database of boxers and media companies to enjoy flicking through to select just the right next step to develop your boxer.What makes this game is the matches.  Some gladiator games offer very simple matches and choices, but this game sets text/stats based strategy apart, taking from excellent features within the Total Extreme Wrestling series. You can choose to auto simulate the matches, but most value will come from “watching” the matches unfold.  The writing is incredibly detailed, detailing 3 minutes worth of text per round over <8+ rounds giving line by line detail of what specifics are happening in the ring, punch by punch, move by move. This really makes the game as you can imagine the exact moves and the excitement unfolds as you click ""next"" or simply ""play"" to play through the 3 minute round – you really do will on your boxer and pray he doesn’t get KO and puts up a great fight.  The end of each round tells you who likely ""won"" the round on score. There is a LOT you can do to affect your boxers performance during the match (unlike some similar games). There is a whole suite of tactics to use and I make sure I study the opponents before the match, and the end of round statistics, to use the tactics to best effect.  There is always something for the manager to watch and do.  For example, I focus my boxer on using his best moves, tell him to watch out for moves where the opponent is strong, study what is best for him (if he’s a “slugger” I want him to stand and throw back punches, but if he doesn’t like getting stuck in the pocket and clinching I tell him to avoid that – stand back and throw punches from a distance).  End of each round provides great stats – exactly how many attempts at punches, blocks, dodges were made and successful in this match for each boxer. This means tactics evolve throughout the rounds.  The boxer is also in 3 states – is he fresh or exhausted? Is he cut or not? Is he mentally OK or dazed? As the bell rings to end each round you can choose how to treat the boxer – water, sponge, or tend to cuts?  Each victory is a real achievement in itself.It's just a really exciting text based fun game to play over half hour to an hour each evening. It’s addictive – you will want to build up 18 year olds into legends of the ring. You get to choose when they retire.Over time, building up your gym and getting better equipment will enable you to manage more students, fighters and build better statistics.There is a period between fights which is a bit empty early on (the game is simulated day by day, but you can skip as many days as you like).  I'm sure as you get more fighters to manage you could aim for 1 match+ each week.In terms of learning the game, there is no tutorial BUT unlike many games there is a big “?” in the menu to show you where the help section is.  This clearly explains all features of the game and is very easy and quick to read. Also after each boxing round if you hover over the tactics options it will tell you what does what.Any negatives? The sound / music is non-existent – try playing Rocky tunes on your PC for atmosphere!  I also think the database, while huge, is perhaps a bit too huge to really appreciate individuals characteristics and styles. Games like Total Extreme Wrestling are naturally more suited to “colourful” characters, more so than boxing. I’d love it if the database included more description of the boxers history and made them “characters” and not just “stats”. Anything that helps with immersion is great – the immersion is fantastic in the ring, I’d just like a bit more immersion outside the ring.  Also I don't like the ""weight"" system much.  I had fights set up but the boxers didn't meet minimum weight requirements so matches were cancelled at the last minute I was looking forward to.A stats and text based game is not for everyone, but if you love that style (as I do), this is a perfect game for you, especially if you love boxing, management, strategy and numerical analysis.  This is a surprisingly rewarding gem of a game. The price is fantastic, priced perfectly. I would pay AT LEAST £7.99 for this and would still get a bargain, so the base price of £3.99 is fantastic and if you get it on sale even more so (as you also get some valuable trading cards).  The fact this incorporates Steam Achievements is a bonus too.A note to the dev: Fantastic game, keep up the great work, I really appreciate this game being made and available on Steam. With a bit more immersion outside of the ring and on sounds/music this could be even higher rated (how about cheering crowds/boxer entrances with music, etc).  How about press conferences and trash talking to affect boxer morale? How about a deeper RPG element for boxers with external events affecting them (marriages/accidents/more traits that come and go)?  Can we add branding around the gym and have different managers and gyms compete?  Can the gym “buy” different established boxers and run a team of boxers?A note to potential buyers: If you’re in the niche who enjoys these types of games (and you know if you are), buy and support this game.  You should not regret it.  My rating is 6.8/10 68% - highly recommended to niche buyers."

As well the dev keep updating the game with suggestions of us so im pretty sure this will be the best boxing manager so far if it is not already.The game cost of 1 or 2 beers so I gladly took it and it is one of those games that you are more then satisfied with buy and price and quality!I recommend this game to all you boxing lovers that love sweet science!

Its not perfect and there is lots of things that could be done to improve it however for the price you cant complain and the fact that its still being improved by the developer is great. It has a huge amount of replay potential and for all those people who complain about there being no tutorial it really takes about 30 min of trail and error before you start finding out what works and from there you keep learning. It can be abit of a grind at times and the interface could be improved which is something that might hopefulky happen in the future, But overall i love this game!"

Ive played out of the park baseball, and Ive played a certain populuar wrestling text based sim (not sure if I am allowed to advertise outside games), but this game was pretty bad for me.   No helpful menus, sort of just go figure it out on your own, and the fights take WAY too long.  A new line of dialogue comes up every 5-6 seconds of the fight.  Most of it is quite repetitive.  I found myself halfway through the first round just hitting sim to end.  I loved some of the features, such as inbetween rounds being able to focus on different strategies.  However, the time it takes to go through one fight is quite off putting.  I won by unanimous decision, and then found out i had to sit through and sim the rest of the card?!?!?!  pft, no.  I just dont feel the immersion.Pros: round by round strategyOpen type gameplay, you pick your opponents/times/etcNot tied into a certain path like console game career modesCons: No idea what half of the stuff doesTakes way too long to sit through fightsNot feeling the immersionGraphical buttons/menus are as basic as it getsNo polish on the product.In the end, it feels like the base of a possible awesome game, but almost seems like someone gave up on it and just tried to wrap it up and throw the game out there as quick as possible.  Its like they need to take this game back to the drawing board, add a tutorial, helpful menus, complete overload on the user interface, re-do the match simming (think somethin like WMMA), and just overall polish the product and this could be a good game."

This game desperately needs one but does not have one. You can maybe figure things out on your own but honestly you probably will need outside resources of which there are few for this game. Secondly even for the things you can figure out certain things make no sense. When matchmaking you can send one request with one fighter and have to see if they accept or decline. While i understand why i would have liked a system where you send requests to multiples and priortize them. Because the thing about it is the person will most of the time in my experince decline even if we are around the same level of ability, rank and renown. Then the game does not notify you they decline, only if they accept. So then you have to waste another day trying to send out another match. After you get a mtach you have to get them down to weight, which guess what isnt clear how to do again beacuse of no tut. I havent been able to progress this cycle. I will not refund the game though i should on principle because i really want to like it.

This has happened on every fight I booked.  Definitely not worh 4.99.  I have yet to see a boxing match because I cant train my guys or book them properly. SOmeone tell me how to even get these guys trained properly...EDIT: Okay  after playing the game, its not a bad game. Pretty repetitive and alot of time in looking for marketing, matchmacking, etc.  Problem with this is there is no way to tell who will reject or accept your offers for marketing. Such a slow build trying to build a gym and reputable fighters. I Think I have been 2 years in now and still got bunch of unknowns.Another issue is the realism. So I thought I was having my well trained guy with double digits in offensive category going up against a can fighter with bunch of 1s. The 1 somehow knocked my guy out, which the dude is like0-3...wtf?"

I love boxing and I love sports management sims so this is of great interest to me. There is a real skill to building your fighters up and that does make for a steep learning curve but stick at it, there is much to like about this game."
