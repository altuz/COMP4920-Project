When I didn't have money for Steam games I spent about 150 hours on Serious Sam games. Getting mods and trying them out, playing through the fun campaigns, all that.When HD came out, it was quite a big deal back in 2009. Serious Engine 3 was *very* well optimized. It ran on anything mid-range back then and the graphics were beautiful. The only down was the change from cartoony to photo-realistic. TSE in 2010 was a complete dream.Fusion promises multi-threading, DirectX 11/Vulkan, 64-bit and improved workshop support and it does those damn well. On my potato, on High setting my framerate is increased by 40% and Ultra by 15%. Vulkan has its effect, but I can't tell since I have a 2GB GPU so it has a negative impact for me.If you have a high-end PC you will get much better framerates than the original.Something else that is good is Serious Engine 2017 for Serious Sam 3, as Serious Engine 3.5 was quite a flop and fairly unoptimized. Oh, and split-screen.So, do I reccommend Fusion 2017 over the original 3 games? ♥♥♥♥ yes. Seriously."

Inmy opinion, it's by far the best Serious Sam game ever made, and even one of my top favorite FPS games ever.Please, as an old time fan who has played every game,show Serious Sam 2 the love it deserves.If you share my opinon, please upvote so that Croteam might glance at it."

However the general graphical fidelity is the same as the HD version with the added inclution of ambiant occlution and some higher res effects like better bloom, shadows, etc.Main thing here is improved performance and bug fixes thanks to DX11 and being on a newer serious engine.However this is beta. Expect stability isssues and a few missing things like particle effects or broken hitboxes.If you are a serious sam fan who liked the origonal and/or hd remakes then i cannot recommend this enough. For someone first getting into the franchise. I would recommend the normal hd version becuase you wont have to worry with the issues of bugs at whatnot and this comes free with it anyways.Serious sam heaven for me right now."

So what you get is an ""HD-er than HD"" version of the games, and on top of that, a host of fancier graphics settings and options, including consolidated Workshop support with cross-game capabilities, multiplayer against VR players, plus the ability to seamlessly move from Sam game to Sam game, which I think is pretty cool.While I've heard some people cracking jokes at how many versions of Serious Sam there are on Steam, this is a pretty awesome move from Croteam and definitely a great way to ensure people get the right Serious Sam experience regardless of platform or preference.

But it still confuses me.Since I own Serious Sam TFE, TSE, and BFE, I didn't expect an enhanced HD Version of First Encounter HD at all. Now that I hear there is going to be enhanced versions of TSE HD  and BFE with this, I will be playing these yet again to see the differences.Now I'm not sure if this is using Serious Engine 3.5 or 4. It has to be one of those engines since I see they reworked the Gnaars in the game. Although I must admit they do look wonky when they move their arms.There are a few things I noticed in the enhanced version like blood on guns and stuff like that, so IT MUST be using a newer engine. But still not sure which it is.But if these are going to be the enhanced versions of TFE, TSE and BFE, then count me in! Although BFE is my least favorite in the series, I will replay it. Hopefully Croteam will consider remaking Serious Sam 2 in this engine for Fusion!"

,Recommended,564310,33179989,Posted: 3 July,all,Progressive Rock,"Man, what a blast. LITERALLY!It's crazy to think that one of my favorite childhood games of all time is now recreated inside a brand new x64 engine, taking inspiration from the best engines in the market and turning it into an intuitive creation tool for Croteam and its fans.To see ""2nd Encounter"" all over again, but with new textures for enemies, maps, weapons, gibs and even projectiles is completely priceless. Now that they've just updated Serious Sam BFE into Fusion as well, I couldn't ask for a better time to buy the Serious Sam Complete Package, since it's so cheap with summer sale around.As the name suggests, the product is a beta version still, which means that are some pretty infuriating bugs around, especially on co-op (I've yet to play more of the singleplayer mode). Croteam and Devolver make a perfect team together, and they've been pushing the boundaries recently.The amount of community support they have is mind-blowing. You basically report a bug and, in the same day, someone from the development team answers you and forwards your information to the whole dev team. AND THAT HAPPENS THROUGH STEAM (crazy huh? Valve needs to learn a thing or two about that, by the way).But let's talk gameplay, shall we? The maps are just like how I remembered back in the day, with huge open areas, over the top lighting effects and huge waves of monsters waiting to smack your face until you alt + f4 dozens of times in utter rage. The best thing is that USUALLY (I say that because sometimes the CPU cheats a little) when you die, it's something you did wrong, so it encourages you to evolve and be a more attentive and cautious player.Weapons have a great feel to them (except the sniper, which has some ADS bugs when using the scope, but I believe that can be easily patched in the future), giving you just the satisfaction you need to overcome our ♥♥♥♥♥♥ everyday life problems.BUT CAN YOU RUN IT? Well, I had annoying problems trying to play SS3 BFE in the past, it ran like GARBAGE (no offense, but I'm being honest). Even with 16 gigs of RAM, an FX8350 overclocked at 4,2GHz (okay, it's a five-year-old CPU, but come on, the game is pretty old too), and a GTX 1070, I couldn't reach stable framerates even in closed areas. Also, every time I turned the camera 180 degrees, the whole game stuttered like hell. I'm happy to say that this problem is GONE with the Fusion version. It just ran like it should've, with gorgeous 100+ fps on the highest settings and in combat as well.There is some confusion relating Fusion and its ""free to play"" status. It is a free engine, but you need the other games added in your Steam library to enjoy them in the new engine, or else you just can't play. I have no intention of testing VR mode, since VR equipment is unaffordable here in Brazil and I'm not even a bit interested in it, but it's cool to see that feature added for VR-suckers out there :D.Overall, it's being a wild ride testing this engine and I can safely say that it's massively satisfying to play it with friends, just like every Serious Sam game. I hope this gets out of beta soon and becomes a full engine, it deserves it.8/10"

And through it you'll be able to launch those games that you've purchased, with continuous fresh updates. I also believe you don't need to install those games separately in your library - Fusion will add and update them as they are released. For instance I don't have the BFE installed in my library, but it has been downloaded and was playable through Fusion when it was released for Fusion (2 days after I got it).If you're here wondering if you should get any Serious Sam, I can't promise you you'll like it if you've never played any before, but those that are currently available through Fusion are definitely exactly those that you should be playing if you're looking to get into it: (1) Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter, (2) Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter (NOT Serious Sam 2), and Serious Sam 3: BFE. You don't really need anything else.I feel like if you don't like The First Encounter, you won't like any of the rest. It's just not about the graphics, you know. Hope that helps. I wouldn't worry too much about the Complete Bundle. Just get the First, and if you like it get the Second Encounter and SS 3: BFE (the DLC for that one is allegedly good too, it adds maps and bosses).A note of appreciation to Croteam, the developer.

It is much more balanced than SS 3: BFE, at least on my weak little laptop. Includes the original campaign, in a more handsome presentation that the HD iteration, as well as Karnak Temple. If I understand correctly, Fusion will be a general platform for all SS games in the future? If so, the biggest reason to buy it: build the community. I would love to see large numbers of people on nightly multiplayer runs. Plus, it's in Beta, so we can only expect more to come."

,Recommended,564310,32002511,Posted: 27 May,all,CZC,"WARNING: The following is an actual review of Serious Sam Fusion 2017, unlike my other reviews!----------Serious Sam Fusion 2017 is an updated re-release of the classic series, dragging it into modern times. Serious Sam Fusion 2017, which is currently still in the beta phase, is a whole new way of playing the Serious Sam games. As of this moment, only Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter and Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter in both VR and “Flat” options are supported with this new Serious Sam engine. Fusion provides the opportunity to play the series all in one place, which enables multiplayer across all titles.Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter sees our hero, Sam Stone, use a futuristic technology called ‘Time-Lock’ in order to prevent alien Mental from destroying Earth. This involves collecting four elemental keys as your motivation. The best thing about this game, however, is that you can fire cannons with actual cannonballs!Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter picks up right when the first game left off, with Sam Stone continuing his fight against Mental. The game has a somewhat different story to the first game and it is more fleshed out when it comes to design, as it was released years later. The Second Encounter is also a much more satisfying game to play and both games are still a lot of fun though and the remastered visuals still hold up pretty well.There are a lot of improvements for the series in Fusion. The like of which, of course, can be seen with the drastically updated graphics. There are newer graphic APIs such as DirectX 11 and/or Vulkan. And, because of this newer Serious Sam engine, Linux, Mac and Windows can be played with cross-OS multiplayer. The new engine also provides split-screen multiplayer.But with all the newer graphics and features in place, it also brings back lots of memories of the older games. Back when it was just one player with his weapons and insane running speed. Personally, I remember when I first played the Serious Sam games. My first game of the series was Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter, which was an updated version of the original game; Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter. I remember that it was, and still is, the most fun FPS game I have ever played, and all Fusion does, it makes the game even better!Overall, Serious Sam Fusion 2017 brings the series up-to-date with much success. It keeps the fun of all the original games while adding something new to the mix as well. This is why I give the game 9.1/10."

As i said it might be my imagination.-Sam's Body don't split into pieces from Heavy Attacks, when you die.-You MUST Reload your Colts (it makes the Colts almost useless)-Switches or Levers have a shiny Border now.

One thing I hate (and thats the reason not completing THE FIRST ENCOUNTER) is the Werebull. I dont like the Keer Skeletons in Serious Sam 3 because they jump and turn to fast. Now in Fusion 2017 the Werebulls are turning so unbelievable fast so thats impossible to dodge 20 of them on normal difficulty.The new graphics effects are good and the sound got improved. Nearly everything is the same, but the AI got changed to fix some pathfinding errors. Is it good or bad? I dont know it because Werebulls are faster. I wish they at least give us the option to play with the original stats of the enemies but at the moment its a beta. I hope they change some parts to get the best experience.In my opinion the Werebull (thats my main complain if you didnt notice) are even harder (faster) than in Serious Sam 3 where I didnt have any problems.-> The Fusion Update is great and offers a good base to play all Serious Sam games in one launcher including new Serious Sam games. I like shooting things without any reason. Look at my playing time in Killing Floor 2 - 420h on an RPG Server ( minus 80h vanilla ), but Werebulls are just way to hard. I like that Serious Sam is a hard game if you wish to play on serious difficulties."

The engine might, but you have to pay for a completely separate set of games (Serious Sam VR) in order to use those features. This is not clear from the description.As an updated version of the original games (if you already own them on Steam), it is nice to have, but if you are looking at it for VR, don't bother, because it is not a VR game at all.  You will have to buy Serious Sam VR if you want that.Steam needs to remove the VR section from the game's details, and the developer needs to remove all mention of VR from this game's description. It is misleading and deceptive.I don't have an issue with the fact that they are selling a new version of an old game, or with the fact that the VR version is a separate product, but it is very disappointing (and a big waste of time) to download this expecting to be able to use it for VR, and waste more time trying to figure out how to enable that, only to learn that they want another $40 for a completely separate product.I wouldn't have wasted my time if this had been made clear in the beginning. I feel sorry for anyone else who is looking for something to try on their new VR headset, and ends up in the same boat."

I also noticed that when OpenGL support is on I get almost the same FPS. Now both Vulkan and OpenGL are at max setting for the results. Serious Sam now has a benchamarking tool and this is how I got the numbers I did. I have played and beat both encounters, got stuck on a level on the DLC because the door will not open. With the 3rd game due to come out with Vulkan support I am hoping for some big updates. It is nice to see that Croteam is coming out with patchs and updates for the game quite often.

,Recommended,564310,32626738,Posted: 21 June,all,MLV,"I've got a crap-ton of hours invested in this franchise (hundreds).  I purchased all the titles on CD before they even came to Steam.  Once upon a time, I was ranked in the top 3 in the world on one of the multiplayer maps.  I only throw that out there to establish that I'm really into this franchise and know it pretty darn well.Fusion is a welcome upgrade, and the fact that Croteam has made it available for free (if you already own the originals) is awesome.  As I write this review, only the first 2 titles (TFE & TSE) are available, but BFE is supposed to drop soon.  The graphics upgrades to the original titles is nice.  That said, Fusion remains in beta and although the gameplay is nearly identical, it is not 100% identical.  Specifically, game physics have been a work in progress.  Rocket jumping--a staple in the original titles, was not replicated initially within Fusion.  Croteam has since adjusted that and it is available again, although some of your old moves will need to be adjusted--and some more outrageous moves probably still won't work.  Also, multi-player Workshop maps have had compatibility issues and not consistently worked (game will crash for joining players).  Again, as I write this, Fusion remains in beta so I'm not considering this a ""con.""A potentially controversial element of Fusion is the inclusion of VR players in multiplayer.  This is currently implemented in 2 ways...the first being that they can join a ""regular"" server, but have certain advantages (e.g. double guns).  The second is an option to create a ""VR Friendly Server"" which actually alters some of the game physics.  As far as I'm aware, there is no way to keep VR players off a server (if you had such a goal)--you can only create a ""regular"" server which might be less attractive to them than a VR Friendly Server.  The issue at hand is balancing gameplay...Croteam has thusfar chosen to give VR players different abilities.  This doesn't bother me personally (since I primarily play Co-Op) and I only mention it because it is very different than the original titles.  FWIW, I've chatted with a number of VR players on my server and they universally love playing the titles within Fusion...so if you own VR gear, then grab one of the original titles, get Fusion for free, and play the games in VR!Other than that, I'd just say that I friggin love Croteam and this franchise.  They didn't need to provide this free upgrade, but they did.  These are great games and I'm very pleased to see new players brought into the fold via VR."

Croteam are really cool about that sort of thing and this is a great way to play classic SS games with a modern high level of polish!"

I sure will recommend this game to my friends."

If you own the previous Serious Sam games except Serious Sam 2 you will automatically get Serious Sam Fusion 2017 for free. Even in its current beta state I can say that the gameplay feels no different. It's a straight graphical upgrade, and in the case of Serious Sam 3, also a performance upgrade, because Serious Engine 3.5 is a massive flop.And Kleers are still ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. But now in HD+HD!"

It's straightforward: just run around and shoot stuff. Can't complain about that. Lots of cool guns and destruction with a bit of challenge."

,Recommended,564310,34103903,Posted: 8 August,all,VoodaGod,"I just completed the first encounter, and am about to start the second.The graphics look great, and the performance was also great, there are a LOT of options to turn down/up to suit your system.I definately recommend you play the Fusion version if you want to play Serious Sam.The Game:the first encounter was pretty hard even on normal difficulty at times, but once you figure out how to herd enemies and avoid taking too much damage, it is really fun and rewarding.UPDATE:I just finished the second encounter, which is even more fun than the first, especially because the scenery changes more, as well as offering a couple new weapons.it is also a little less serious, as it has a lot of secrets which don't really make sense in the world but which are quite funny.after playing the first encounter, the second encounter was a lot less difficult on normal difficulty, as you already know a lot of enemies, and will have (hopefully) gotten better at shooting & dodgingUPDATE 2:I now finished SS3, and really enjoyed it. The shooting just feels so much more satisfying than in SS1, however i rarely felt aiming down sights was useful.Sprinting fits the gameplay perfectly, it allows you to get out of situaitions that were hopelss in SS1.The graphics are great, and the cutscenes are as bad as Sam's one-liners, just like we like them.Normal difficulty seemed quite a bit easier than in SS1, but that might be due to the abundance of medpacks & armor, which you can find by exploring the environments.the first few levels give you access to all the guns too slowly, but  then they open up & become more similar to SS1"

What more can you ask for?My only big hope is that some of mods from BFE (specifically the .44 Mag Revolver) gets ported over to Fusion.  I would love, absolutely love to tear through Mental's army with that little beauty at my side.Thank you Croteam for showing that you love your fans with this wonderful gift."

76561198139166456,Recommended,564310,34346506,Posted: 19 August,all,SCP-001 Overseer,"This review will be aimed at people looking in the reviews section, asking themselves ""Should I buy this game?"".To answer that, let me start with asking YOU a question. Are you a you're a fan of fast-paced first-person-shooters, being a one-man-army, decimating literally hundreds of enemies (per map!) using spectacular weapons, and epic one-liners that would be cheesy coming from anyone else? Seriously though, the dialogue can be really funny/awesome sometimes. Anyway, if you answered ""yes"", then you've come to the right place. Serious Sam is a game about exactly that. You may have heard the phrase ""No cover, all man"" relating to this game before, and it is a good description.Before I continue about the game itself though, I want to mention the more important thing. The Developers. Croteam, of Croatia, are my favourite game company of all time. Valve, Bethesda, Ubisoft, EA, and many, MANY other famous (or infamous) developers have checkered reputations. Dodgy or imperfect business practice and the like. But Croteam? None of the sort. They're the type of developers who genuinely want to make a good game. If they find an issue, they fix it. I got an update for my Serious Sam 2 game a few months back, despite the game having been out for a really long time already. I like this, since it means that Croteam, again, want to make their games great. They're not just after quick money like some others you may have heard of, and that, to me, is just as important as the game itself. So trust me when I say that you can't go wrong by getting a Serious Sam game, provided it falls within your gaming tastes, I mean. Even Serious Sam 2 is awesome. Go get it! It's an incredible masterpiece of a game, even if you own the newer Serious Sams. It's different enough for when you still want Serious Sam, but want something different after playing the newer ones for a while.Anyway, back to the actual game. So, from the get-go, you're pitted against impossible-to-normal-people odds, fighting Mental's (bad guy) alien hordes. You'll start out with a simple and limited weapon setup, and you'll expand your arsenal as you play, finding newer and deadlier tools of destruction as you make it further. The enemies will ramp up too, along with your weapons, in enemy type, and in numbers. So, the fun and challenge is omnipresent. Now you may be asking me, ""Is there a reason I shouldn't buy this game?"".If you answered ""yes"" to my first questions, then my answer to you is ""No, there isn't."".""But what if the game is too hard? You said the enemies ramp up and stuff.""Yes they do. However, YOU control the difficulty you play at. Yes, yes, not exactly a unique concept, but done in a unique way. Tourist, Easy, Medium, Hard, Serious, and finally, Mental. The difficulties aren't just number changes. As-in, you aren't just going to take/deal more/less damage or something. No, all difficulties are hand-tweaked throughout the entire game session to custom-tailer to your preference. To give you an idea, on Easy, your health constantly regenerates slowly (faster on Tourist) and enemies do less damage, and there are tweaks to enemy types, numbers, placement, etc... And on Serious, the same tweaks are made to enemies, except in favour of more dangerous enemy types. There are MANY other changes though, including item placement/availability and such. Even then, every difficulty is playable and fun in its own way. I've checked, and even on Serious, the game is fully winnable and fun, just harder. What I'm trying to say is, if you like this KIND of game, you WILL like this game, regardless of difficulty preference. Thanks go to Croteam for taking the extra time to go through each difficulty and make it an overall enjoyable experience start to finish.""You said 'deadlier enemy types'. What if I don't like the enemies, weapons, or something else in this game?""Admittedly, not a question most people would ask pre-purchase. However, I feel I have to address this. The best part!THERE IS AN EDITOR.Croteam gives you your copy of the game, and it comes with a free editor in the Tools tab in your Steam Library (If you don't know where that is, Google can help you find it.). This editor allows you to custom-tailor your game to your preferences and tastes, without beforehand knowledge of coding or anything. You just open it, open the thing you want to edit, and it'll list all the variables for you to change through simple number changes. You can also edit your enemies. Basically, everything from weapon damage, fire rate, ammo, and projectile explosion/damage and stuff, to enemies themselves. Don't like that guy's attack? Change it. Think this guy does too little damage? Increase it! You can make the game harder, easier, and just more fun in general. And everyone has this power over their own game. The best part of the best part? If a client joins you, your settings take preference, so you won't have to worry too much about not being able to play with your buddies. You can also make and edit maps, including the existing campaign maps, and there are plenty of tutorials online. Personally, not something I do, but that brings me to my final point.Lastly, the icing on the cake and the cherry on top, this game comes with a modding Workshop, which turns the already-endless replayability up to an 11. New top-notch guns with new stats, new fan-made maps, new and interesting enemies, new anything! A crowning jewel, cementing this game's place as a game you will be playing and re-playing for years and years to come. :DOverall, this game is an uncompromising fast-paced first-person-shooter with its entire focus on the player's experience. Seriously, this is my favourite game series of all time, from my absolute favourite developer of all time. And I'm such a serious gamer that I had to think long and hard about putting this at the top of my game list. No, really, I have a favourite game list. And I spent Sheldon Cooper levels of time with internal struggle of whether or not to dethrone Dead Space 2. Long story short and many weeks later, Dead Space 2 now sits in a solidly comfortable 2nd place. :)"

I'm playing it now and still love it. It is such an improvement from the last time I played, thank god for the HD versions. I would definitely recommend this game to all of my friends and everyone.Downside, I wish I could play with some people because the multiplayer section of the game is a godamn desert."
