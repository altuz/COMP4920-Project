Given to me on my 7th birthday and I STILL HAVE THE ORGINAL CD'S!I cannot describe how good this game is. It has aged so well and is still much better than most other city builders out there. The graphics are still good, the game mechanics are fantastic, the wonders really make you strive towards goals, and can easily spend HOURS perfecting a city. So many things to consider the game will keep you constantly busy.Unlike Ceaser and other city builders this one really just pushes you to want to keep playing towards the goals they set. I always find myself getting board of Ceaser like games. Which with every mission having to build a bigger city. Gets kinda boring. Pharaoh nailed it! I have been playing this game since 1999 and it still has never gotten old or boring for me and still offers a great challenge. I play it at least 5-7 times a year and I still have not beaten it! swearing this is the time I beat the game ahha. There is just so much game play to be had and if your an architect like me then you know your OCD really draws out the game play! haha. You will spend your time building cities, trading, fighting military conquests, building wonders from pyramids to great Alexandria library, the history of the game is pretty spot on, and the music is still fantastic to this day. There is nothing you wont like about Pharaoh other when pharaoh's army comes and destroys your town being such an incompetent♥♥♥♥♥♥with your finances.For new players download the HD mod for the game here.http://www.wsgf.org/dr/cleopatra-queen-nile/enIts so much better in 1980x1080.

It still looks beautiful even with its age, and the concepts behind it are timeless I think- building and growing an economy and a city. Keeping people (and the gods) happy all while balancing employment percentages, war-time destruction, and fellow cities trade demands is so much more fun and exhilarating than it sounds. There's a campaign you can run through, starting out with tiny mud huts and growing into mega-cities, or you can jump into a sandbox and simply build without having to worry about meeting the goal criteria.

However, in terms of gameplay, it's aged incredibly well.Yes, it's a city builder. However, it's a scenario based city building game. This is good as it shakes things up a little. And, as occurred in real life, the tasks you are given before you can progress to the next get ever more sadistic (yes, sadistic is the correct word unfortunately) based on the requirements of your Pharaoh. True to form, they want the biggest and best monuments for their own necroplis. They also want the largest armies. And all the while, you need to keep the Gods happy and also maintain your finances.So, in summary; you'll like the game if1) You like games where there is a balance to maintain, in addition to growth of your city2) You like games where the gameplay is scenario based and segmented (most scenarios take an hour to 2 hours to play through)3) You like games where the complexity and needs of society develop in difficulty gradually over the course of the scenarios4) You like games where it throws you the occassional curveball that you werent expecting to test how well balanced your city isThe AI in the game is a bit simple and you'll see things happening that look silly (delivery men taking goods back and forth between storage yards, those pesky bazaar women refusing to walk down your best street, firemen walking past a burning building without batting an eyelid) but apart from that, there is very little about this game that isn't entertaining. You'll need to get your head around the quirks (game speed settings, trading with stuff that usually goes in granaries, etc).But once you manage that this is a very fulfilling city builder."

,Recommended,564530,29475235,Posted: 24 January,all,Onesmy,"Feeling lazy/sleepy/you don't have time for this stuff and I definitely wrote too much? There is a tl;dr at the end, just for you.I bought the game as soon as I saw it was released on Steam. I probably spent hundreds of hours on that game as a kidbecause Ancient Egypt, and being able to play it again on Steam is really awesome. Weirdly enough, the game is even better than I remembered... well, except that the Steam version doesn't include any other language than english, when there was at least a french version (of quite good quality if I remember correctly) when it was released on CD, and probably a few other languages. It feels like something is missing, although some reviews seem to indicate that language patches can be found online.Ancient Egypt nerds will appreciate playing with the names of the gods and the cities in their native language.Otherwise, this game is just great. It's old, sure, but it's a classic. If you enjoy city builders or strategy games, you should definitely grab this one. The campaign has a nice story and lets you travel through time following the history of Ancient Egypt, from one pharaoh to another. The gameplay is well-thought and you'll get accustomed to the interface and the buildings bit by bit, following both the ""big"" tutorial at the beginning (actually a few missions in pre-dynastic Egypt) and the invention of new technologies or the emergence of new trends (irrigation, ranching, popularisation of the game of senneth, ...) that are also good occasions to give you more information about the new things introduced by the game. I really like the way Pharaoh + Cleopatra is teachig you everything you have to know: you have enough information everytime, and also enough time to actually get accustomed to the new buildings that were just introduced before new ones appear.As for the game interface in itself, you can easily see what a specific area is missing, by using either the maps detailing the various problems and administrative informations (appeal of the area, crime, fire risk, tax incomes, etc) or by directly asking your advisors or your people what's wrong or missing (too much crime, lack of diversion, lack of beer, etc). I really like having all the information easily available like that. There is also a screen giving you a quick overview of the state of your city where the most important pieces of information are clearly highlighted, and pop-ups giving you all the urgent information (army marching on your city in a few months, request from Pharaoh, poor flood incoming, fire in the city...).A major point that I don't see mentioned so much in the reviews is thatthe game will always allow you to choose between two different kinds of citiesonce the tutorial is over: either you play in a more military one (more armies to fight so you'll have to work on your defenses and develop strategies to ensure you can react or stall for time whatever happens) or you play in a calmer city where you'll have to ensure that your city is prosperous while building crazily huge monuments for the glory of Pharaoh/a god/some random noblemen and noblewomen who aren't even named because who cares, they're just asking you to spend years building something, it's not like their names are important anyway.This ability to choose what kind of city you feel like playing next at the end of each mission combined with the high score tables for each city is a great incentive to keep playing the campaign so that you can play each mission at least once. And yes, that basically means going back in the egyptian timeline just so you can build all these monuments/defeat all these armies that you didn't even see in your first playthrough. Also, if there is a particular mission you don't like, well you don't have to cheat your way out of it, just try playing the parallel mission.On that subject, there is unfortunately a recurring bug in Pharaoh when building pyramids. Sometimes, the construction will freeze. This bug can be avoided by doing some specific manipulations detailed in the discussion section of the community hub, but you should be aware that the game isn't 100% bug-free before buying it. This bug was already in the original version, so long-time players will not be surprised nor feel lost about it.TL;DROh come on, that review is hardly long enough to have a tl;dr section! But fine, here it is.Youshouldbuy this game, although it's missing the other languages it was originally released in. It's both fun and easy to start playing with a good tutorial and a very informative and easy-to-use interface. Also, this game will bring you on a nice journey through the history of Ancient Egypt.You'll get to choose for each mission whether this time you feel more like defeating big armies or more like building big monuments (with a bug you should know about sometimes happening when building a pyramid that results in freezzing the construction until you go through a few corrective steps). And sometimes you'll end up doing a bit of both with a bigger focus on what you chose to do, while still ensuring that your city stays prosperous.Oh, and did I mention Ancient Egypt? Yeah. Ancient Egypt. Isn't that like the coolest part?"

It just keeps opening up and opening, I'm sure once I'm ready to tackle a hard mission or play sandbox it will keep me busy for hours and hours.  Lots of graphs and things to consider for gamers who like that stuff.  In my head when I started I kept treating it like an AOE/base building game cause that's what it felt like to me, took me a while to wrap my mind around the 'citizens of a city' vs 'peons funding a war effort'.

This game has a 221 sites manual!! And you need it. Every industry has it's own ways of functioning. So either you'll read the manual or you play the (very well made) missions which teach you (mostly) everything you'll need to know.Also there are tons of buildings, which is very overwhelming beeing used to ""Is that all?!""-experiences like in Tropico 5 (without the DLC).If you are a fan of strategy games, young or old:PLEASE PLAY THIS!!Great that Steam brings back all the good old games, so that you do not have to play them via GoG or something.

BAMAMA-Oh sorry, I was copying that one part of Khu that made the ENTIRE game an instant legend.Ahh yes, this game was one of my FAVOURITES as a child, and I STILL play this game, still makign scenarios for this game in 2016. It's easily one of the best games since Ceaser 3, if not BETTER than it. Why? The game fixed many problems that Ceaser 3 had. Although the Pause and build feature from Emperor is not yet implemented, this game has improved on many aspects, such as the Mission Editor. I REALLY love the Mission Editor in this game, as it gives you much more creative freedom, by modifying the map anyway you wish. Although I would have to say, this is a precursor to Zeus/Posideon.The gameplay is solid. You build a mighty Egyptian Metropolis, and try to solve the issues of employment and such. I learned allot about Egyptian History from this game, and actually, it inspired me to become an amature Egyptologist. I LOVE the Egyptian names of the cities like Men-Nefer (or Memphis), and the option to switch between classical and Egyptian aka Greek or Egyptian, and, funfact, if you switch to Classical, the mission also pronounces it that way (so if you have a city that you run like Waset/Thebes, and you start the mission with the briefing with classical city naming switched, the mission man says Thebes instead.).One of the flaws I have to say, is that after the new Kingdom era, you are no longer Pharaoh. It makes me really sad because when I started the Valley of hte King Missions, PHAAAROOOHH TUTMOSE TOOK ALL THE ♥♥♥♥ING CREDIT FROM ME. I think also, it's kinda sad there's no multi-player like Emperor... I honestly want a Pharaoh 2 built on the Emperor or Children of the Nile Engine with Multiplayer, but has that same feel of Pharaoh.Overall, this is a classic you MUST own if you don't already or just saw this for the first time.

After 18 hours the game fails to play for more than a few minutes, animations done play, resolution gets locked to the lowest setting, reseting the resolution crashes the game.  Steam validator fixed the errors one time but then registers that game as validated, tried reinstalling, patching using 3rd party patches, combining the previous with different compatability modes, ect.  I have spent more time than I would have on this game then any other previously.  Should an updated binary be made available i retract my ""no"" for recommendation."
