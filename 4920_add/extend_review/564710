76561198073864538,Recommended,564710,29828079,Posted: 10 February,all,risestorm,Ok to keep it short and simple. If you like idle games you will find this game appealing. If you do not like idle games stay away from it .The game is pretty simple you are a coward but to still reap the rewards of dungeon crawling you hire soda addicts in the local bar to do your job. You can set the group on automatic mode or use their ability on your own. Playing the group on your own is pretty repitive therefor i set it on automatic. It's a simple yet fun idle game :)8/10
,Recommended,564710,29946305,Posted: 15 February,all,[Djazz],"I first played it on mobile,Only played for a little bit on PC.It is the same, without ads, and of course, on a bigger screen.Pretty addictive, simple, yet fascinating.You *can* play it like a traditional, turn based RPG game,Or as a simple management game.You can attack manually, or let your party attack by themselves.Choose the gear you FIND in dungeons (or buy in the shop for dirt cheap)or let them be equipped automatically.Manage different classes, items, boosts, powers, items, in a very simple yet effective way.The best of all is you DON'T need to pay even a cent, EVERYTHING if unlockable with igc (in game currency)what you *HAVE* to do is recruit 5 adventurers, the rest is optional (and fun)"
,Recommended,564710,29756664,Posted: 6 February,all,Wiltale,"TL:DR Great game, Worth a shot.First things first. (First review lol) this game is incredible. It's not a ""Active"" game. It's more idle it in the background until your dungeon raid is complete, Upgrade a bit. Repeat. I sunk 200 hours into the mobile version. And was hyped for this release. I'm so glad it's finally out too! (Small note, Fullscreen doesn't look all that good. :P) It's simple, pixelated graphics still give me nostalgia and it's an amazing concept executed in an amazing way. I'd definitely give this game a shot. It's free and i'm sure a couple hundred megabytes can't hurt the hard drive.Graphics wise it's not the prettiest, It's simple. Clean. I like that, Sure if you're playing it ""active"" then the repetitive zones get a bit ""EHHHH"" but that's not the point of the game. Just leave it running. If anything 'better' graphics would make this look like a flash game. So your hopes have just plumetted. (how sad)Even for what, 5 minutes of gameplay it's already amazing. Nothing to complain about. But if this isn't your type of game thenDon't leave a review. Simple. I do hope this game gets future updates and allows me to sink hundreds of hours in.Pros:-Unique concept, Bande together a bunch of unique adventurers and warriors/mages. Head into the dungeon and earn loot, With said loot upgrade your tavern and attract more ""powerful"" customers. With endgame products costing a couple million gold each, I doubt you'll complete this game in the first 500 hours or so.-WARPING. The warping feature in this game is amazing. If you pay a small sum for a wizard to set up shop in the tavern he will be able to warp you to levels of the dungeon you've cleared (In incriments of 10), Each level costing an additional 10 gold. So say level 300 would cost you 300 gold. Simple.-Music. The music. Oh god the music. It never gets old. It's the same 2 minute piano/drum track played on repeat. But it NEVER gets old. Trust me. It's kinda catchy too >.>Cons:-Graphics, You can't expect much graphicwise from this game. It has simple, 8-Bit pixel graphics. And you'll have to learn to respect that.-Nothing more.Overall, Game is wonderful. 100% worth a shot for checking it out. The developers keep in contact with the community and deserve everything they get."

Still, why is this one so addicting?!....It's good. It's free. Try it."

76561198042913113,Recommended,564710,30011223,Posted: 18 February,all,caidicus,"As a Clicker Fan, This is Right Up My AlleySimple to learn, but deep enough to get intoI've long since been a fan of clicker/idle type games. My first adventure into this genre was with Clicker Heroes, which is still a shining example of the genre. Having played that game for well over 2000 hours, I'm always on the lookout for another idle game that I can open up and let play on its own.Soday Dungeon doesn't disappoint.The basic mechanic is pretty simple, buy heores, let them do the dungeons for you. You can play it move by move, if you'd like to, and there is certainly an advantage to hand picking each of your moves, to advance to the next round. The thing is, I'm the kind of player who's just too busy to sit at the computer and play round after round of games. I much prefer being able to set it up, then come back to it a while later and see what I've earned.Soda Dungeon really shines when you start getting to later dungeons and racking up the gold. You can buy upgrades that bring new hero types to your bar, allowing you to assemble an ideal team that will bring you to ever higher dungeon levels. Add to that the loot you gain from dungeons, auto equip the strongest set, and just let the game do the rest for you.Worth the Modest Real Money PriceIn total, I've spent about $10 on the special heroes you can get in the game. Sure, I could probably grind my way up to unlocking them, later, but again, I like skipping at least a little bit of the grind. I feel the 1 or 2 dollars for each unlock were reasonable asking prices for extending the joy of the game.A Great Free-To-Play, Even Without Spending Real MoneyEven if you're looking at playing the game absolutely free, there's a reason the game has been praised by so many review outlets. It's simply just a fun game to open up and let run itself. There's depth in all of its mechanics, it has a nice retro graphical charm to it, and it doesn't require you to invest any more time into it than you absolutely want to.I strongly recommend this game to just about anyone who's a fan of fun games."
,Recommended,564710,29881731,Posted: 12 February,all,Fairy Grand-Gropist,"Yes it's an idle game but i ADORED this on android. It's balanced by your choices of characters and what you equip them on each run of the dungeon. Some in game items are overpriced but they all cost more or less the same with actual money. For example, the ""speed up dungeons"" thing you can buy costs 50 million in game gold, or 1.99. Nothing really goes any higher than 2 bucks.You can choose between playing like an RPG or letting the game auto battle. Sometimes its beneficial to do it yourself to make better choices. It's a great balance between idle and actual game. All i can say is, give it a try, and get to at least level 100 in game. It's really great and won't take that long."
,Recommended,564710,30051767,Posted: 19 February,all,SlaveDeMorto,"Surprisingly enough for ""clicker""-like genre this game has pretty interesting gameplay.Basically a Cookie Clicker mixed with turn based RPG.The more characters you unlock and gear you find, the more interesting gameplay becomes. Since all characters and gear has its own stats, passives and skills the options for making a perfect team are pretty different which is setisfying.You can play this game manually or as a ""managment sim"" with ai doing all the work for you. But to be honest AI is pretty dumb."

,Recommended,564710,29837289,Posted: 10 February,all,Kodyd194,Soda Dungeon is probably the idle game I have most enjoyed out of all the idle games I have played.  I am really enjoying the art and sound design and would recommend any idle game fan try it out.
76561198038793663,Recommended,564710,29782801,Posted: 8 February,all,samuelblaize,"Soda Dungeon is, essentially, an incremental game. Like Cookie Clicker and Clicker Heroes, the game essentially plays itself, though I'd say that Soda Dungeon both requires more interaction, and rewards the player more for said interaction.You start by hiring heroes, equipping them, then sending them to fight monsters in an ever increasing difficulty dungeon. Every 5 levels there's a miniboss, and every 10 there's a boss. Once you reach level 100 (then 200, then 300), you ascend the world, and gain a new relic, which gives you pretty big bonuses - people who've played Clicker Heroes will recognise what's happening here. Characters do not level up, instead progression is done through items and leveling relics.And really, that's all there is to the game. Like Clicker Heroes, it's very simple, with a surprising amount of depth. It's nice to just have on in the background, checking on it every now and then. Put auto battle on and come back once an hour or so.The art style is, like the game, simple. There's a decent amount of enemy sprites, that are all pretty well drawn. The animations are a little too basic for my liking, but that's not a big deal. I'd like a bit more variety/interesting visuals, but oh well. I really like the music, but of course it tends to get repetitive after a while.I only really have small issues with the game. This was a mobile game ported to PC, but no keyboard controls have been added (would be nice for selecting abilities). Some of the controls are a little awkward because of this, but it's easy to get over it. I'd also like a bit more control over how the auto battle works."

Especially with no paywalls, I love the game so much."
,Recommended,564710,29796908,Posted: 9 February,all,Marple,"Why this game is great.And why this is probably the only mobile phone game which really deserves to be on PC.Soda Dungeon is already a great game on App Store. It always had a great Score and Content was always coming out.For this game to come out on Steam is a huge deal. Not only will the playerbase rise, but the developers will get more out of it. Surely, that seems like a greedy thing to do. But in the past the game always had new features and new things added.The core mechanics never got destroyed in those updates (I'm looking at you, Robocraft). Most mobile-phone games come out on steam just to make extra money, but then leave the game behind.I genuinely think this will not be the case with this game.(Atleast i hope so, DON'T U DAMN RUIN THIS GAME DEVS; URE DOING A GREAT JOB!)For those who never played Soda Dungeon, it's pretty much a tycoon game where you have to go into a dungeon and find money/items there to upgrade your tavern. And if you're done with that, you can just restart, like any other tycoon.But it's special, trust me.Pros of Soda Dungeon:-It's F2P-You can get everything just by playing the game-It's AD-Free (But in my opinion you could atleast add in some non-disturbing ads. Maybe a blackboard with all the ads playing when you click on it? I dunno how this works.)-You have to strategically think what you're gonna do when going into the dungeon.-Placement is key! If you place your junkies in the wrong spots, they won't be as effective.-Arena for your needs if you get bored from the monsters in the Dungeon.-You never have to backtrack, except when you restart the game.-MULTIPLE SAFE FILES. This is a small thing but meh.-You can play it while in school on your mobile phone. *Hehehehe, suck on that, Mr. Dreuss* =)-You can now play it on your PC when your handy battery runs out!Meds-Some people may find it boring after just a couple of runs, some find it exciting. Depends.-If your battery runs out, you can't play it in school anymore. ;-; *Goddammit, Mr. Dreuss*-You cannot connect with steam to have your steam save-file correspond to the mobile one. (Devs, WORK ON IT GODDAMMIT)ConsI have no idea what to put here. I am way to fanatical of this game. Search other reviews, they probably have cons.This is my opinion. It's a game of love and drugs. And it's a tycoon.<3 u devs.-MarpleJones, The Swaglord, The Masterf*cker, The guy who is still virging FOR GODDAMN SAKE.PS: Don't let those soda junkies get to you, haters always hate."

I have a mere 211 hours on the mobile app, but that is enough time to reach the end of the content and work on the best strategies for team/item comps.So far the PC port is a great adaptation. It captures all the charm of the original on a much larger screen. Leave it running as you do other activities and check in later.

Has a cash shop for early unlocks, but it seems everything can be achieved with patience and dedication. Even with that, the early unlocks are very reasonably priced, so you get a very decent bang for the buck for donating a bit to the developers.Appears to have a very nice selection of loot drops, including uncommon and rare drops and a bestiary and item catalogue to see what you've yet to find.Wide selection of adventurer-types to unlock as well, which you do by improving the tavern and supplying it with the right kind of drinks that attract them.It has a satisfying amount of layers to unlock and find so it's well worth a download and play for fantasy adventure/explorer fans. It has dungeon crawling, arena contests, tavern management, rare loot drops, character outfitting, and a several other parts of the game that I haven't unlocked yet and may take weeks to do so, so it really has something for everyone.It's free, so hey, worth a look. I'm happy I did. This game is definitely staying in my active library."
,Recommended,564710,30093407,Posted: 21 February,all,SCP-3600 (Glenny),"I played this game on mobile as a freshmen in HS about a year ago, and lemme tell ya - this game takes the cake as one of the best time killers, when afk or studying I would set up a party to go raid the dungeon, and sometimes sitting through class when there was nothing to do, or even a conversation starter (Me and a group of friends played this game). I think the best part about this game is the OST.I do think there could be a few changes that can be made, such as:- the shopkeeper selling higher tier armour the furter you progress into the game (It's kinda awkward to have someone selling you iron armour when you're on level 3000 with midas or demonlord armour)- and a few more deminsions (After dimension 10, or someway to aquire the next few relics in a faster way)Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a nice, RPG-like dungeon, one that doesn't require too much skill or management after later levels.10/10 would/should be playing right now"
76561198005283699,Recommended,564710,29764666,Posted: 7 February,all,Bodhi's Pool Repair,"I am surprised how fun this game turned out to be. It's essentially a clicker game/RPG with a lot of customisation and the possibility to play idle, active or both. You are never forced to spend any money on microtransactions and I was able to progress without paying anything. Also I didn't get the impression that portions of the game are artificially slowed down to make you pay, which is nice.First of all you have to take care of your hub level (tavern) to attract new and stronger heroes and store more powerful items. You do this by gathering gold in dungeon runs, but you can later invest in a passive ability that gives you gold while you are away. The dungeons become increasingly difficult until your party gets defeated. If that's the case, you keep all gold/items and will return to your hub. In the meantime your tavern attracted some new adventurers, so you equip them with better gear, found or bought in the run before, and try to get a little further.Your party can consist of up to 5 adventurers and each can have their own class with special abilities. You fight monsters in turn based battles, where you click on each adventurer to carry out your actions, be it standard attacks, magic or using items. You have an option to enable auto fighting and play the game in idle mode so you don't have to click and most of the time the AI behaves reasonable. I tend to take control myself in the later dungeons to use each hero effectively.The overall style is simplistic but fitting and has a nice arcade vibe to it. If you want a game that offers more depth than your standard clicker games (actually hell of a lot more) get it. It's free after all and a nice little time waster."

It's a great free-to-play game to add to your collection.  There are some in-app purchases but there's no ads, and the game is a lot of fun.You start out in a tavern, and the main character is too afraid to dungeon-delve, so he hires ""drunken"" tavern patrons to do it for him.  As you adventure you collect gold and different gear for your brawlers, and gradually upgrade the tavern.  More tavern upgrades = more and better fighters = longer dungeon runs = more gold = more tavern upgrades.  If that equation didn't make it obvious enough, this game is a grind.  It's supposed to be.  It's a bit like a mix between a clicker game and old-school Final Fantasy turn-based games.The game also features an auto-battle mode, which is handy for when you dont feel like doing all the clicking in lower levels of the dungeon, but you can definitely do the strategizing yourself if you want to.This game is hella fun on mobile, and just as good on Steam.Overall Rating: 9/10"

,Recommended,564710,29770477,Posted: 7 February,all,StarLordMan,"I love it. It's like a clicker game but with far more depth to it. You could play this game for quite a long time before you reach the end. I'd say that Soda Dungeon could benefit from Mod-Support. But, for a free game that gives so much; this is a gem for sure. You can set the game to fight for you if you don't feel like micro-managing your party. They do a desent job of staying alive, dealing damage, and healing effectively. Sometimes they do something dumb like forget to heal but for the most part it's a wonderful little game. I'm unsure if there is anything on the market like this. Truly unique for what it does. I'll paint the picture for you. Playing Minecraft on my Xbox 360 on a CRT TV in the corner of my room. Smoking some dank♥♥♥♥♥weed. Chewing on some snacks. While my computer is playing this game for me on a 70inch 4k TV. The sound quality is amazing. I'm using my Xpadder program for my other 360 controller on the PC. Allowing it to act as my mouse.

I have not spent any money.)What seems like a casual RPG that could quite easily milk you for money, comes a fab game with surprising depth (albeit, not in the battles- though this is not a bad thing) and you don't need to spend a penny.Graphics can be a bit ugly, especially when shrunk down for a smaller window. Some of the SFX are un-godly, and being ""retro"" is no excuse.However, once you get into upgrading, working out how to spend upgrades, finding that one item you need to make your next run better, deciding on how to build your team, and so on- you want to go further.You can turn on auto-combat, but this only works when your fighting easier levels. You'll need to control it yourself to take on tougher levels. And, you get more money from later levels. So you can't just coast on auto-combat alone. You can grind, but the game usually gives you enough to make your grinding much shorter if you build your team smarter.Follow some of the Steam guides to make your experience a little easier- but I'm seriously tempted to throw money the devs way for this. Great time sink."

There is actual strategy, work, effort, and decision in this game that actually requires skill. Most games like this just go: make this much money by doing the same thing over and over again, but this game has enough content, goals, and strategy to keep you playing forever.The gameplay is awesome. You have to assign your crew certain items, armor, weapons, and set them up in a way to get the best level and success. It's great.Replayability is fantastic, it goes forever, but it has a genius game mechanic (you'll see if you play) that keeps you going on and on but it doesn't really feel pointless.Enemy variation is great, item variation is great.IT IS NOT PAY TO WIN. You can play this game and get all the acheivments whothout a penny.The art is great.BUT THE MUSIC. PEOPLE, THE MUSIC. The music gets REALLY good farther into the dugeons, seriously. It's high quality beats dude.its good. Its free. why not?"

It's a cute little idlying game you can keep running on the background while doing other things and check back every so often. It's pretty nice to mix and match a few items here and there to progress further and all and does have some minor complaints here and there like healers waiting too long to heal when it would be more benefitial to do it earlier or the spam wasting of magic in earlier stages when it's unnecessary but other than that this game is pretty well done and a good time waster in my opinion."

Unlike crappier ports, PC integration works great. I enjoyed having another idle game in my library, especially one that played as well as Soda Dungeon.This is a game that relies on prestiging to advance, a similar concept to other idle games; however, this one emphasizes on almost a pseudo-JRPG interface, allowing you to outfit your ""soda"" heroes with piles of loot that you get back. If looting isn't your style, there is a pretty nice auto-equip function that will, for the most part, give your heroes the best loot possible. If you AFK this game, you will likely hit standstills in the midgame, around levels 500, and a few bosses onward. Without giving out spoilers, some bosses have certain weaknesses that force you to turn off auto attack and learn how to fight them, or to only pick a certain lineup to defeat them.Overall, I really enjoyed this game, it's a nice title, and at the low price of FREE, it's a bargain."

Soda Dungeon has been out for a bit on mobile and is a recent addition to Steam, I hate mobile games and refuse to play an incremental on a cellphone so I was ecstatic to find out Soda Dungeon was coming to PC.Soda Dungeon I can only describe as an idle, rogue-like, turn-based roleplaying game. You start the game off innocently enough grinding gold to upgrade your tavern so that you may hire more (and better) party members, this grind is fun for a fair bit but after the 3rd or 4th prestige the grind becomes inexcusably long; I can only assume this is to entice a player to buy micro-transactions given this IS a free game and all, but the grind gets absurd later in the game.Pros:-Game is absolutely thrilling to watch play itself on a separate monitor-Active gameplay involves more than just spamming LMB or setting up an auto-clicker-Nice visuals-Fairly large amount of contentCons:-Micro-transactions-Insanely long grind after getting a decent ways into the game, an attempt to get you to buy said micro-transactions7.5/10"

Despite the enemy sprites getting old and repetitive quickly, the combat system was formal to the genre, nothing special, the game was still a great free find. I enjoyed the idea of the soda to lure the fighters in, thought it was pretty original and funny. The dungeon ideas were pretty basic, but the music to go with the fighting was one of my favorite features. Especially the fire dungeon, the water dungeon and the frozen city. And also the ending was great. At first unsatisfying, I really enjoyed replaying the game and hoping for a different outcome. Good game, hope that eventually you could play with friends (not sure about that but hopefully), that the enemies are more than just reskins of eachother, more dungeons, more things to do in the game, because I finished it in 3 hours.Still playing eagerly and waiting for my dreams to come true for the game."

Your job is to recruit (hire) the visitors of your tavern, equip them, and send the party into the local dungeon for loot.  That loot can be spent aquiring new gear for your party, or invested into the tavern to attract new, more skilled, visitors.It's a port from a mobile game and certainly plays that way, but it's free and worth a few hours of entertainment.Here's an example of the gameplay"

It's all about grinding/exploring the dungeon and upgrading the tavern with the loot you bring back.You can purchase a stall for a merchant who will collect better gear as you get further into the dungeon. You can also buy new sodas, stools, tables, and other tavern upgrades to attract new soda junkies (different classes of characters to hire.). You can even hire the merchant, tavern owner, and other local NPCs to explore the dungeon for you. I like that the game rewards you seemingly no matter what you do. By that, I mean, every upgrade you purchase feels meaningful and useful plus you can purchase a banker upgrade to earn interest on your money while not playing the game. You also get gold no matter how far your party makes it-and with the autocombat system, you can safely walk away for a bit or watch your party just rake in cash for you til they die. Then you just hire new junkies and go back in over and over again.I'm sure it will get boring in the end, as most things tend to do with me, but I still have more than half the upgrades/soda junkies to unlock plus more than 900 more levels to the dungeon to explore. Knowing I'm collecting money even when not playing means I'll keep coming back to this in between new games that I play. The progression rate is pretty steady, too, so I'll likely play it several hours at a time without realizing it whenever i do come back. This isn't a game I can see myself binging on for days at a time (like Dark Souls, or Skyrim-games I would play all day every day for days in a row) but it is certainly a game I can see myself playing an hour or so daily or a few hours a week. Regardless, this is a game I plan on coming back to play repeatedly until I've seen all it has to offer."

,Not Recommended,564710,29774734,Posted: 7 February,all,LotusBlade,"I agree, this game is among the best ported games from Android to Steam, yet i dont feel like it should be recomended even for free. You see, a lot of mechanics arent polished and are just very small. You have a tavern with upgrades, but there is only like 20 of them, half of which you gonna max during first 2 hours of grind and they dont do much. Gameplay consist of repeatedly and booring clearence of endless dungeons filled with same opponents and loot per run. You may think this is idle game, but its not. So called 'auto grind' will not be available till you buy specific thing in a shop and it requires days of grinding manually.In battle there is few to none options to choose from, mostly consisting from choosing target for attack, since auto-fight is dumbest one i ever seen. Those guys have no idea when to use skills, which opponents to attack, when to defend etc. They aint taking enemy dmg and your own life in consideretaion, so, for example, can heal 20 hp to get 25 overall while enemy hits for 30 - they could simply deal some damage instead and win that fight. Also auto-mode uses all mega skills for mana starting from the first fight, so there is no point to buy strong fighetrs and force them doing it without your control.Equipment managment is also annoying until late-late game where you can buy better options. If you dont want to equip 'fire stone' to every fighter, you have to manually set 'healing stone' before every fight. Or you have to sell all bad items after every dungeon, so those champs wount equip crap. Its just too much effort required for such a small game. The grind is very strong in this, i mean it! When you are getting 2700 from dungeon on auto, which takes a good 10 minutes, or you get 4-5k from manual clears, but they will be 2-3 times longer. Now you guess, how much it cost to get some upgrades? Millions of coins...So, to make up my mind:- There is small upgrads system, which should be 10-20 times bigger;- There is no real varietty in dungeons and battles leading to repeating the same things over and over;- Music and sounds are not entartaining, nor epic - you dont get a feel to listen to it for more then 20 minutes in row;- No way to improve weapons or armor, same goes for heroes;- No way to decorate tavern with some items,- Only few items to equip per champion (5), while it should be over 10 (better 15);- Bosses are booring 'fat' version of normal monsters (no unique skills or mechanics, like where only specific champ can deal dmg from his current position);- No rare occasions, like super legendary champ with 1% chance of appearence came to you for hire;- Would be better to get some sort of buying boosters in tavern to get random heroes, when they just come to you - its not fun.The good part:- Graphics are nice, somewhat unique;- Easy to learn and play, especially if you dont want to beat it but just want to play for a few hours;- Some intrigue regarding portal and VIP systems, which holds you around till you figurer out what they do."

The tavern only has around twenty upgrades, most of which you can max with not very much grinding. The dungeon is boring, monotonous and incredibly repetitive as you scramble around fighting the same enemies and receiving the same loot over and over again.

It is a breath of fresh air compared to the other clicker games that encourage Parkinson's Disease. Soda Dungeon's main objective isn't something novel, you hire adventurers to raid a dungeon to get gold to buy more soda to get more stronger adventurers to raid stronger dungeon levels to get more gold and the loop is infinite. You build your tavern in this order Soda Junkie --> Ruffian --> Thug --> Fighter --> Conjurer --> Healer --> Thief --> Knight --> Project Zero. The main draw of the game is that it follows the time-tested formula of adventuring while keeping it simple. However, it is an eternal grindfest.Conclusion, try the game to know what it is but don't play for long. It's simple enough to play but my guess is that one will get bored as it's a repetitive, neverending loop. It is guaranteed to loop all the way to Dungeon Level 750 and above. Personally, I got bored at around level 50. The automation in this game is both its bane and boon.PROS1. Simple AdventuringIt's not complex.CONS1. Pay To WinIt is $0.99 each to unlock the various heroes and tavern attachments. This is very obvious from the start of the game. It is a cheat code for $0.99 each time.2. RepetitiveGet heroes, dungeon, upgrade, rinse and repeat. Gets old after a while.3. No Skill BuildsNone at all. Each character doesn't need to build a skill tree. No special combos or anything.4. No differentiated Mechanic / ClassSoda Junkie, Ruffian, Thug, Fighter, Conjurer . There is no sense of variety. The new units you get just get exponentially stronger. While there is a small difference between the Fighter and Conjurer due to the attack values and hit points, the Conjurer is far stronger due to her ability to equip 2 Items. E.g. Fighter (30 HP 7 Attack) vs Conjurer (29 HP 6 Attack)5. VIP BuysI believe it's just to scam people into paying the $0.99 for nothing. It's specifically timed after level 50 just for players who are willing to spend the time on it. I think it's a belief that after a certain amount of time invested, they can target these players to pay $0.99 as an upsell. The VIP items cost like 50,000,000 Gold in-game or $0.99.6. Fake BestiaryI thought there was a whole lof of monsters just like Pokemon. Imagine my disappointment when I saw the reskinned versions of the same monster. After level 50, every monster is just a different coloured version of a level 1-50 monster. E.g. The level 70 boss is just a blue version of the level 10 boss.NEUTRAL1. Automated Best Equipment BuildsNo thinking required. There's always a better item to choose from. It saves a lot of thinking but it removes a bit of thinking.2. Automated CombatAutomated so you can run it in the background while doing work. While smooth, are you playing a game at all?"

This game is the first Armor Games title I've played on Steam. Armor Games is/was (?) big name in old school Flash gaming that just hasn't been as successful in tapping the mobile market and incentivized advertisement as Kongregate. And Soda Dungeon isn't going to help them do that.Soda Dungeon is below mediocre in so many aspects. Humor is bland and unsatisfying as an old soda drink that's been uncapped for days. The game is fairly ugly for a modern retro sprite graphics. The only sensible thing about its endless dungeon delve gameplay is to turn auto battle and never bother with it again.The upgrades are few and very few of them have meaningful reward. It's very greedy pay-to-not-play title that insults the gamer in you by selling its final upgrades piece by piece for a dollar. For an upgrade game where all you do is stare patiently at auto-playing battles and then spend the loot on upgrades, and repeat ad nauseum, buying these upgrades for a dollar or two (even if cheap in comparison with whale-oriented mobile games) just makes zero sense.At least Armor Games pokes fun at themselves that the game has no ads, because Steam does not allow ad-funded games on their platform and God Bless Gaben for that decision.I won't say don't download and waste an hour playing, because it's educational to see how poor Armor Games foray in Steam gaming is. But you shouldn't do like me and spend tens of hours trying to find anything fun in this rather blant, hollow, greedy little bugger."

The game has unique mechanics that make it feel fresh and independent, like it didn't take anything from other games. The pixel graphics affirm that this game can stick in your mind for quite a while. The gameplay is addictive, making you want to get right back to dungeon crawling. The goals you set for yourself are just as satisfying to complete than the goals the game sets for you. Its hard to stop playing once you've started, making it one of those games I like purely because its so addictive. Its charming, fun, and really good, and I believe it could be a budget title, maybe around $4.99, but the game is free, making it easy to access and just start playing.Overall, the game is entertaining but, is kind of forgettable. The story is virtually non-existent, and the game doesn't throw many new combat options, making it a total button masher. Plus, Steam has a large library of much more popular games that easily overshadows Soda Dungeon. You could argue that that goes for a lot of other free games in the Steam Store, but Soda Dungeon makes it easier, being a turn-based RPG style pixel graphic game, making it seem extremely underwhelming at first sight. Have I mentioned the story? I never felt like I was fighting for anything, just hiring convientely placed mercanaries to go into a dungeon to fight to give ME money. Wait a minute, this is kind of reminding me of something. OH YEAH. This game is extremely overshadowed by a similar game that requires money, Darkest Dungeon. And I'd rather purchase a much better reviewed and recommended game rather than download a free game I'm just gonna delete after a few hours, or just let it sit in your Steam library. Soda Dungeon's whole mechanic is like Darkest Dungeon, making it feel ripped from the game.6/10-Okay:)  Addictive                             :(  Lack of Story:)  Charming                             :(  Gets Old Fast:)  Interesting Mechanics         :(  Easily Overshadowed By Other Great Free Games:)  Fair Difficulty                        :(  To similar to a much better game:)  Potential to Age WellSoda Dungeon is a good title to kill a few hours with, say on a plane ride or a lazy Sunday, but is not recommended for the kind of gamer who wants hours of gameplay. Trust me, just go BUY a different game like Darkest Dungeon. Ultimately Soda Dungeon is an entertaining but forgettable and kind of underwhelming experience that lasts a few hours, then is forgotten, and thrown into the back of the closet of everyone's library. I do recommend it, however, because it offers some interesting and addictive gameplay."

It is STILL FUN though!I believe this game can easily break out of the mere clicker game status it has, if they would add a lot more endgame content.

,Recommended,564710,29859479,Posted: 11 February,all,DrYoshiyahu,"Soda Dungeon is a great twist on the idle game, and like all idle games, the unlockable content and customization options are nearly unlimited. There's a lot of great redeeming qualities, but most of all, I want to praise the ability to take control at any time, making it non-idle, as well as the liquidate feature in the store, which is one of the best in-store features I've ever seen in a game.The AI used when idling is questionable at times, especially the healer class, and there's times where your party dies because of that, but that's the price you pay for not micro-managing your party. There's also times where the best items in each category all have negative stats, and if you auto-equip party members, you can end up with literally 0 damage. At a certain point, manually equipping items is always better than auto-equipping.In the end, it's a free game, and everything is unlockable without paying a cent, and despite the repetitive nature that all idle games have, you still feel rewarded with every new feature you unlock. It's a good game."

76561198107733905,Recommended,564710,29856700,Posted: 11 February,all,Reaper Whisper,"This game is honestly pretty good overall, out of everything, I'd give it an 8/10.Back awhile ago, I got it on mobile and had enjoyed it greatly, and I'm glad to see that not much has changed when it went to PC. The style of the game really fits its atmosphere, but, the game can get grind-y at times, but that's fine to me as you can just set it on the background, put automode on, and do something else and check it for anything later on.There is a big complaint I have though, and that's when you use the item the ""Fire Gem"". When a character uses it, the screen get's wave-y and it makes me nauseated and gives me a headache. I know I could just not use the item but it is pretty helpful in groups early on. So, that's one of the only things that I request get's fixed or an option can be added to disable the effect.Another small complaint I have is the screen progression, it's kind of very sudden and like a flash. Maybe making it more like a slideshow would reduce flash or making the screen fade in and out.But that's all I have to say about the game, overall it's pretty fun to play in your free time!"

,Not Recommended,564710,29970965,Posted: 16 February,all,Hsanrb,"I WILL BE USING IDLE GAMING TERMINOLOGY FOR THIS REVIEW, IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST NONE OF WHAT I SAY WILL MAKE SENSEI have officially reached post-game content for this idle game and while the first 10-15 hours was enjoyable, once you've done a few soft resets, you can kinda formulate a strategy. Having played like 4 of these in the past (like 3k in  Clicker Heroes due to sleeping with it on) I can say this one left me disappointed with what they could have done.Essentially theres a dungeon, and to intice heroes to your tavern you have to serve appropriate soda (hence the name) you start with a free drink to get going... then enter dungeon, earn gold, buy more soda, get better heroes, repeat.Every 100 levels, theres a centurion that you must vanquish to unlock the ability to soft reset your game... you get some permanent bonuses and start at square one again. Lose all your gear and soda, climb dungeon, reset, repeat.I loved the game, it can work really well... but OP can be OP and bore the heck out of your game. If you play it right, each reset (or dimension) can take literally 2 hours to beat because OP is outright broken. If you played clicker heroes and got good at that and could answer ""What is the best way to advance zones really fast to improve my HZE?"" this game is officially too easy for you and I'd pass. YES, if you can answer that question this game is really too easy for you to play compared to other idles.Because of the last paragraph, and that paragraph alone... I'm downvoting this game. I may try other builds to see if they are better... but my playthrough for the last 2 days has been start a run, play dota, come back, reset, start run, play dota, reset, ""OH I've reached the end game now"" start run, watch dreamhack, fall asleep, win game...JUST LIKE IN ALL IDLES, ONCE YOU'VE RESET TWO OR THREE TIMES THE SNOWBALL FOR EACH RUN RAMPS SO FAST YOU CAN KNOCK OUT SEVERAL RESETS IN A SINGLE DAY AND BE DONE WITH ALL THE MAIN GAME CONTENT."

,Recommended,564710,29845876,Posted: 11 February,all,KaalBron,"Fun and interesting time waster!Video format:https://youtu.be/X4MrP1yi-9oText format:Soda dungeon is a new free dungeon crawler now available on steam.The story goes like this: You're a coward without a penny to your name, luckily there's a tavern that has soda which makes people easy to convince to do dangerous things for you. So basically you can hire people to go raiding for you. The main character must be an evil person since he uses the power of the soda for these things, he even calls it a business model. Luckily no characters ever die, they just run away after their HP reaches zero.It's an interesting setup. The gameplay is pretty simple. You buy upgrades in the tavern to attract better characters and buy items from the shopkeeper. Then you go and raid a dungeon and try to get furthest you can.There is only one dungeon, but you don't always start from the beginning. There's a wizard in the tavern that can teleport you further. In the dungeon you collect gold and items to buy more stuff and to get even further next time.And that's about it. As I said it's very simple. A very good time waster. You don't even have to play manually since there is a much needed auto attack option that controls all your character actions. Other than the main dungeon you also have arena mode for more rewards. There's a portal that I haven't yet unlocked and probably many more things that I haven't discovered, but I only played for an hour. There's more pleasant surprises hidden beyond my progress point. There are no real cons to the game, it's a perfect time waster and if think you'd enjoy something like this, check it out. It gets a big recommendation from me. Also did I mention the incrediblylikeable artstyle and amazing soundtrack? Or the fact that you can max any category in the tavern for a dollar?That's pretty nice, it also mocks ads!Truly a great example of how a free game is supposed to be made."

With your party, you go into the nearby dungeon and have them fight for you, as you watch. When everyone runs out of hp they run and drop all of the loot letting you pick it up. As you go in further there is better gold and items. Back at the tavern you can buy some weapons, items and armor. More impotantly (Since you will be finding high value items in the dungeon.) you can upgrade the tavern to attract better people to go into the dungeon. There are a couple of things that do not need to be mentioned but stools and tables allow people to come to the tavern, different sodas attract different classes, and the wizard can teleport you to the farthest area you have reached. Also reputation is a stat in your tavern that has to be upgaded to get all of the classes, so that you can't just buy the soda. A conjurer's soda doesn't cost to much but needs 400 reputation to get into your tavern. The gameplay in this game goes as far clicking but there is skill to it.This is everything that you should need to hear to play the game, and it is FREE, might I add(you can buy some items for .99 but you do not need to.)"

Anytime you want to take a break you just can't. It's got that ""just one more"" feeling down pretty well. Also, this game is NOT a measily two hour experience. There's actually a lot to do, as you will notice upon playing. Finally, the graphics style is great. Great FTP Indie game for anyone."
,Recommended,564710,30183931,Posted: 25 February,all,Pained Demon,"This game is deffinatly worth playing. You see it's an RPG and it's done really well. The animation may not be much but the little bits of it make it better in my opinion than constant movement. The gear is pretty original, and some of it is hilarious. Even the achivements are funny. You even get a choice of actually playing or just letting it go auto. Overall this game is definatly worth downloading and playing."

I tend to leave it running a lot, so I show as having hundreds of hours in the game.Soda dungeon is a RPG that allows you to be as hands-on or off as you choose, but rewards you more for more interaction.  Upgrades are reasonable, it doesn't feel like a grind-fest, and (cheap) real-world purchasable upgrades don't make the game pay to win (though I haven't bought them)"

,Recommended,564710,29944422,Posted: 15 February,all,caboosetp,"ArmorGames has a hardon for idle games. But their developers are good at it.Soda Dungeon splashes some of the big elements that have grown in idle games like endless dungeons and newgame+ into a dungeon crawling RPG you'll want to sit in front of. Rather than simply being a means to not have an end, Soda Dungeon incorporates these features to provide more real content -- certain things won't show up until later dimensions.The game has micro payments for stuff, but it definitely doesn't pull away from the free content. If you want to throw money at it to progress faster, you can, but the game sure doesn't feel like you need to. Best of all, they don't throw them in your face every 10 seconds like some games out there.If you like being a lazy bum sometimes but still want your stimulation fix for hours on end, this is the♥♥♥♥♥♥"

I've seen this type of game done better, with more consistent and meaningful player interaction.You have to grind a lot of resources in the mid-game.  The only fun parts are when you actually equip your characters with their non-grinding gear and attempt to beat the next boss.  But there is so much time in between these sections grinding gold and essence that it just feels like I don't even have a game to play right now.  It was fun figuring out the best classes and best ways to grind, but the grending sucks!You could grind by controlling your characters manually, but it would get insanely repetitive and tedious.I love the theme, graphics, music, and all that.  I generally like the game, but I can't say I would recommend it because you're just gonna end up with it on in the background auto-grinding.  I wish I had picked up another RPG, but right now I feel hooked on this one to the end.  This is just because of the addictive numbers-going-up nature of this genre and the fact that I'm already invested in it.The free to play aspect seems fine.  I don't really feel like I'd buy anything for a couple reasons.  First of all the game is what it is- a ""watch numbers go up"" progression game that involves a lot of grinding.  Maybe I could have spent $2 so that I didn't have to have the game on in the background for the past few hours while I work, but then what is the game even for?  Optimizing your grinding and putting it on in the background is what you do in this genre.  If I skipped every grinding segment I would end up spending $15 and playing like an hour worth of battles.Well that turned into a rant.  Basically this game is fun until you get to the grinding part, and by then you probably aren't gonna want to stop because you just want to finish the thing and get it over with.  It's still an interesting game, though."
