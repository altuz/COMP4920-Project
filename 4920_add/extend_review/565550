,Not Recommended,565550,29019318,Posted: 4 January,all,MrEWhite,"Game: This is one of my favorite Build engine games of all time! You go around as a redneck while listening to bad♥♥♥♥♥music, cracking one liners, and shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥ What more could you want in a Build game?Steam version: Oh my god, this is a utterly♥♥♥♥♥♥release. First, Redneck Rides Again is completely left out, it is using an outdated DOSBox, it runs with a command line in the background, the option to launch Suckin' Grits on Route 66 is completely left out and you have to make a shortcut your self, and the biggest part...NO MUSIC!Yeah, the amazing soundtrack in this game is left out completely! It can't have been a copyright issue as it's included in the GOG version, which is ultimately superior to this version, and the bin/cue files aren't there at all! So it is basically impossible to get music unless you illegally download another version of the game.So, in the end, DON'T BUY THIS VERSION OF THE GAME! Buy the GOG version, as it includes both the addons, the latest version of DOSBox, and the soundtrack of course!"

,Not Recommended,565550,29029588,Posted: 5 January,all,Psychic Kitty,This version of this game is fundamentally flawed.They use an older version of dosbox...and cant seam to get the code for the window correct.  Resolution they set at 640 by 480 stretched.....and they dont have the redbook audio...so you have no music.I did get the gog version....to compare....not only do you get what this one sort of gives....but it even had=s the red book audio....and the sequal game.This one shows the sequal game inthe pictures but doesnt have it.Also it auto starts the redneck rampage first game....when you exit out it goes straight to the dos mode dos box has.....so thats how you have to access the route 66 sequel.Controls in this one are keyboard only until you run setup....while gog doesnt alow a controller....this one does...and a mouse too....but for some reaosn it doesnt recognize a controller...more setup needed.I dont recommend this verison......get theGOG.comversion....this one is more false advertisement...screen shots on the store page show things not included in this game release.

,Not Recommended,565550,29060629,Posted: 6 January,all,Smoka Cola,"Use to play this all the time when I was younger, hilarious game. Unfortunately this release is sloppy and it's a clear indication someone just wanted cash for it. If you're upset, but you really want to play it instead of refunding, do this:1. Download erampage2. zip the steam RR files and delete the folders but keep the .bat file3. Put erampage files in the steam folder4. drag the REDNECK.grp from the zip you made earlier of the steam files5. Change the .bat file to have only this text: ""erampage.exe""6. Launch from steam.Sounds like a lot of work, but it's a fairly quick and easy process. With this you'll get hires (as good as they can be) textures, widescreen support, and resolutions up to 1080p (possibly higher). I just tried it out and was able to play with no flickering or anything and the game looked great. Still giving this a thumbs down though for the poor quality of the steam release, especially since the GOG ran just fine, albeit not as pretty as the erampage method, it still ran much better than this.Side note, it's all legal too, you're not downloading anything that you don't already own, all erampage does is add additional features."
,Not Recommended,565550,29045657,Posted: 5 January,all,SpaceMonkeyBoom,"Pros:-Redneck Rampage is still a funny and enjoyable game.-The best-looking Build Engine gameCons:-So poorly put together that the game is unplayable-Terrible framerates (teens-twenties on a modern PC)-Too expensive for such a sloppy release-Runs under DosBox, not a direct port!-No music-No modern keyboard/mouse controls: keyboard only!-I repeat: the game runs so poorly it's unplaybleVery sloppy port! Like so many retro games, RR isn't a direct port but instead runs on DosBox. While this isn't a probelm for most games, RR runs very, very poorly.It suffers from very low framerates at the default resolution. It runs reasonably well at 800x600 but in order to do that you have to run setup from the command prompt.That brings me to another problem with this release. The game doesn't exit DosBox after quitting the game. It's a minor annoyance but just shows how sloppy the port was. They didn't even include music. I wonder if they even bothered to buy the license to the game...For $9.99 they really should have done a proper port. The source to the Build Engine has been free for over a decade now. As the game stands it is barely playable.Everything isn't bad, however. The game itself is pretty good and still playable after all these years. It's great nostalgia and I recomend it for anybody who grew in the 80's and 90's.Just don't buy this port."

I was expecting it to be a lot more simple like how Blood was. Apparently not though but hey don't worry I got everything up and running.Go to my google drive and download the dosgames. Since this took a bit of time and I finally got it to work correctly I currently don't feel like messing with anything else because it's all perfect the way it is. MMMkay download the dosgames zip file. Once you download it make sure you place it into your c: drive. It should end up looking like this. ****C:\dosgames****Once that is done make sure you make a back up copy of your Redneck Rampage in your steam folder. It should look like this Redneck Rampage_backup. This is for just incase you mess anything up but even if you do steam will put everything back in the order it suppose to be.Once you back up your Redneck Rampage folder download my Redneck Rampage folder also from my google drive. Once you have downloaded that zip file extract it and place it in the steam folder where your back up is.So to sum up.1. Download both zip files; both dosgames and Redneck Rampage.2. Once you download and extract place the dosgames folder inside of your C drive.3. It should read like C:\dosgames4. Backup your Redneck Rampage folder and rename it to Redneck Rampage_Backup5. The Redneck Rampage folder you just downloaded and extracted from my Google Drive should go in place where your backup Redneck Rampage folder is.6. It should read like this Steam\steamapps\common\Redneck Rampage7. Launch the game and everything should be in working order music and no more flickering!P.S. my save files are still in place so all you gotta do is delete them and start a new file. Also my sweetfx settings are in place as well in order to toggle on and off for sweetfx just hit the ScLk key which is in bewtween both Pause and PrtSc. The sweetfx settings folder is inside the DOSBOX folder inside of the Redneck Rampage Folder, feel free to either get rid of or adjust the settings. My binds are also still in place to. So you will have to go through the controls menu of the game and delete all my binds and rebind them to your personal preferenceP.P.S. Feel free to add me with any questions or concerns about the game. Lets get all these negative reviews off this page because Redneck Rampage is worth playing and someone just bought the game [ME] just to mess with steam and the game in order for everyone else to be aware that someone cares and wants you to enjoy a great gem by Xatrix who also made Kingpin Life of Crime & a Expansion Pak for Quake II before finally disappearing."

,Not Recommended,565550,29098683,Posted: 7 January,all,<tKFct>Tom3,"Original game is a landmark and a must play for gamers interested in the build engine but the steam version was released without proper optimization and configuration of dosbox, I had to gather information with other steam users so I could had a ""acceptable"" performance.The worst part is that some content is missing, for example audio tracks and a entire expansion, ""redneck rides again"", which is shown in various thumbnail pictures and is missing in the final product that is fraudulent and criminal."

76561197992534243,Recommended,565550,33443039,Posted: 10 July,all,Chico,"I agree- There is nothing wrong with this port. If you get screen flicker go back into the dosbox settings menu (#2 selction from start menu) and select 800x600 resolution. Also- the game comes with the complete CUSS pack!! to install it.. goto\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Redneck Rampage\Redneck\CUSSPACKand copy and paste all the files in the cusspack folder 1 level up into the Redneck folder. Next.. under the dosbox settings/sound goto 'sound/Select RTS file' and pick CUSSPACK.RTS.  Thats it!   Also if you want mouse aiming, once in a running game press the U key. if you want WASD movement controls, like modern games, you will need to go back into the dosbox settings menu and make W forward, S backward, Left Strafe A and Right Strafe D. Makes the game soooooo much more enjoyable. :)"
76561198054155868,Not Recommended,565550,33618900,Posted: 17 July,all,Jabroni Outfit,"EDIT: Apparently they increased the price on GOG! It's still cheaper there for the entire collection rather than separately, but now it costs $9.99. Going to leave the original review up.Please do not get either steam version of this game. Buy the GOG collection instead.Even if it runs fine after some tweaking, the fact that they split up the main game and Rides Again into two separate games that cost more for each one individually than the entire GOG collection is ridiculous. You can easily add Rides Again to this, but the fact that they try to trick people into buying a split up version for $10 each is a practice that should not be supported. Spend $5.99 for the GOG version and get the main game (this page) with Rides Again as well as some digital extras as an added bonus.https://www.gog.com/game/redneck_rampage_collection"

I will (and of course others, as well) try the best to bring mods and other fixes to make Redneck Rampage a better experience on newer OS's!Oh, don't forget... the year 2020 can be a special one!Stay tuned and have fun with Redneck Rampage on Steam!Rating 11/10Oh, there is something else:INTERPLAY, you really need to learn the habits of a community like on Steam.

,Recommended,565550,33552023,Posted: 14 July,all,Zhuyin Stormstout,One of my all time favourite games! I definitely recommend this old classic to anyone who likes their silly sense of humor and violence to go with it.Still a pretty decent looking game to this day (albeit it obviously dated) it was one of the best looking shooters of its time.For some reason I am unable to set it to the maximum resolution the options offer however it still has a DOS Setup option which are super handy for these kind of old games.Overall it has my approval and it's great to be able to play this old favourite again!
76561197987175590,Recommended,565550,34240226,Posted: 14 August,all,BlastFromTheJollyPast,"!!Important note!!You will be better off buying the GoG version of the game instead, as the steam version doesn't contain the music soundtrack. Also with the GoG version you get three games; Redneck rampage, Redneck suckin on grits on route 66, and Redneck rides again; it doesn't have Redneck huntin. The GoG version is also better value for money; for an extra 80 pence you will get the other two games, instead of £6.99 for just one game on steam. If you still want to buy the steam version of the game make sure you modernize the controls before starting and people have also suggested on the reviews, setting the resolution 800 x 600 to avoid screen flicking.What I liked about the gameDoors can't kill you.Large open levels which are well designed and awesome to explore; you will never get bored. The game mostly takes place in the rural areas of America; you will be fighting in a small town, a lumber mill, water treatment plant, sewers, and plenty of over places as well.I love the environmental hazards, especially the tornadoes.Plenty of secrets to be found throughout the levels, some are hidden in quite clever places. You will have to move objects, swim underwater, try to reach areas which may seem unreachable, crawl through vents, and many more.A great arsenal of weapons to use against those alien brainwashed hillbillies; I especially liked the exotic weapons in the game; like the teat gun.Great variety of enemies to kill; you start of with the brainwashed hillbillies and then as you progress start to fight aliens.Awesome Protagonist.Free Aim and option to turn aim cursor on or off.The levels have non-violent NPS like; Cows, chickens and pigs (which can turn on you if you shoot them); they blend in well with the setting.What I disliked or was disappointed withNo music in the steam version of the game.Sometimes enemies can shoot through walls.I wish the boxes of dynamite didn't explode, or enemies can't explode them.Game crashes occasionally, so make you save plenty of times.Cusspack becomes dull and annoying after a while; it's alright in the first couple of missions, but after that it becomes unfunny.Dogs are bullet proof sponges; they are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to kill.I was disappointed with the final boss.Shame you can't choose you character at the start; both characters could of had different abilities when chosen.No steam achievements. It's Shame they couldn't have done a remastered version; like shadow warrior or Duke Nukem.Alcohol restores in-game health, but the problem is that if you drink too much, you will get drunk, this causes the controls to go wonky in-game, and it can take ages for the effects to wear off; it can be a pain, especially if there's no food around.ConclusionFantastic game; highly recommend. If you like games like; Duke Nukem, Blood, Shadow warrior, or Outlaw, then I highly recommend you buy this game. It has everything that made those games great; like I said before buy the gog version instead; it's a better deal.8/10 very good"
