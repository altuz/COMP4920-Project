76561198006413390,Recommended,565720,28632109,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,woosk,"Simple arcade game where there are 50 stages altogether. Gameplay involves drawing lines across the screen to reveal more than 75% of a picture without letting a sea creature touch your octopus avatar or the line being drawn. Completing each set of 3/5 stages will unlock additional stages, featured characters and their outfits for gallery and achievements. The game also has an Easy mode which removes the timer for each stage, sea creatures move more slowly, power-ups appear more frequently and the player has more lives to finish each stage. Soundtracks are good with 17 different soundtracks altogether with 1 soundtrack for each pretty girl stage and overall presentation depending on player progress with unlocks is also nicely done. Recommended at its current price of 2 dollars or less as it takes less than 10 hours to finish all stages."
,Recommended,565720,30931423,Posted: 3 April,all,pepsimanvsjoe,"Why did I buy this game?Well, the answer is pretty obvious......I likeQixclones.It's actually a little strange. I'm not a fan of the 1981 arcade classic, but I'll put some serious time into its many clones. In my opinion, the best of the bunch isGals Pani X. Not only is it ridiculously deep, but all of the bosses have attacks ripped from various shmups. How cool is that!?Anyway,Pretty Girls Panic!is modeled afterQix, with a few extra features to appeal to modern audiences, such as online leaderboards. The goal is to draw lines to fill space, while avoiding evil sea creatures. If an enemy touches the player-character while they're drawing a line, then it results in a lost life. The same holds true if an enemy touches the line itself.It's a simple concept, but what makes it interesting is the strategies players come up with. A plan of attack is necessary to obtain high scores. For example, rather than just randomly draw lines until all of the space is filled, try to ""box"" enemies in. If you really want to do some damage, consider building a series of thin walls that go across the entirety of the screen.  Not only are you relatively safe while doing this, the results tend to be awesome. We're talking ""45% of the stage in one fell swoop"" awesome. All enemies that get caught in walls are destroyed, and they can be chained for tons of bonus points.On the downside, the power-ups kinda break the game. If the hero becomes invincible or manages to stop the clock, then they usually have enough time to create a massive wall that crushes several foes at once. Power-ups randomly appear, so sometimes the player will simply luck out. The harder stages really pile on the enemies, but it doesn't make that much of a difference. The RNG's blessing will go a lot further than skill or experience.While the randomness is a major issue,Pretty Girls Panic!still gets a recommendation. It plays well, the production value is solid, and it's entertaining enough to last a few hours."
,Recommended,565720,28787841,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Fishbits,"A PC remake of titles like Gals Panic, an arcade coin-eater from the '90s. If you've played those games, you know exactly what you're in for here. You play as a small creature trying to uncover the picture in the background piece by piece as a swarm of crap on screen constantly tries to kill you.However, in the original Gals games, a masked off area including the model was included as the area that counted towards the percentage of completion, whereas in this game, the whole screen is the completion area, making it possible to uncover the photo by.... not uncovering the main part of the photo? I dunno, it wasn't well thought out. Granted, in the original, uncovering areas of the girl would earn you negative points(enough of which would change the picture to something horrifying), and uncovering the open area would earn you positive, so maybe with that mechanic not in place, that was the intention, but honestly, I can't really see that as much of a justification.Ultimately, whether you want this game will be dictated by whether you want a quick timewaster, served up with some semi-spicy suggestive swimsuit clad Anime girls(Yeah, that's about all you get). It's cheap, it's good for killing a little time, and it seems relatively low on the bug count(None experienced thus far), and while the achievements are a bit cheap(you get one for every stage of completion), it's colorful, it's casual, and it'll keep the boredom away for a bit."

,Recommended,565720,32068356,Posted: 30 May,all,Hippyshake,"Like Fortrix, Fortrix 2, and the grandaddy of all line-drawing arcade games, Qix, Pretty Girls Panic! has you drawing lines to capture space on the play field (in this case, fairly typical drawings of bikini-clad anime girls). Along the way, various sea creatures will do their best to try and stop you; if they touch your line as you're drawing it, you'll lose a life. It's pretty standard stuff, but the controls are smooth and responsive and, as you can continue from where you left off should you lose all your lives, the challenge is fairly minimal.  It also seems to be quick; at only 30 minutes in, I've already cleared half the boards. That's not to say PGP! isn't fun; it is...just don't go looking for it to reinvent the wheel. For a casual pickup game to play when you just want to chill for a little while, it's worth getting, especially as it's less than the cost of a large coffee.  Recommended.EDIT: A quick note about replayability: The game does award ""Perfect"" scores if you complete a board without losing a life. Those boards will have a gold star on them in the cumpulsory Gallery, so if achieving 100% is your thing, you'll find a greater replayability here than the casual player will.(Edited to fix a typo - ""Pretty Grills Panic"" - which, obviously, would have been a much different game.)"

76561198069159152,Recommended,565720,33799311,Posted: 25 July,all,wrb41977,"So, I bought this game for the Trading Cards and to up my game total... It is somewhat simple, and the pictures aren't as graphic as one might fear.  And the game itself is... amusing. Carving out portions of a hidden picture while trying not to be hit by sea creatures (or their shot balls of lights) is an interesting concept (I'm sure there is some game out there that this is based on, but I've never seen it). If you manage to get those sea creatures in one of your cuts (without it touching you or the line) you can remove it. Small power-ups can also be gained by cutting them out, such as a speed one, a ghost one, and one that allows you to freeze the sea creatures.Rather enjoyable, especially for the price of $2."

,Not Recommended,565720,34204866,Posted: 12 August,all,Kei_U,"It's a simple game that encloses the field with lines and acquires the territory. If you know the old game, explain that it is a substream of ""Qix"" and ""Gals Panic"".However, this game is less contrived than these games.First, since the acquired area is always calculated as a percentage of the rectangle of the whole field, it is irrelevant to the silhouette of the girl who is the object of capture.Therefore, all the stages will capture with the same procedure.Second, the area to acquire is the narrower of the field that devided by line.The placement of enemies is not taken into consideration.Therefore, ""99% clear"" which was possible with ""Qix"" is impossible.This limitation makes it a simple task of not playing the game's game."

Pretty Girls Panic is not a bad game in my opinion; however, it is extremely short. Don't let my play time fool you (I had to Idle the game to get all the card drops) I 100% this game in under an hour and a half, and While I thought the gallery was a good enough reward I would have appreciated a sound test for uh research."

I mean money it cost me in the sale.Anyone with experience of this time of game will have the tactics down in no time.Probably easier overall than it's spiritual inspiration 'Gals Panic' and the other games in that particular series.No native controller support at time of writing review. Took me 2 minutes tops to set up an xpadder profile with the massive 5 buttons needed for the game. That might not be to everyone's satisfaction though to be sure.Nice pretty, almost family friendly even, screens of the girls. The odd mini bikini in there would be the only thing putting some people off if they don't buy any adult themed games at all.7/10 from me and a thumbs up."

The plus was the nostalgia factor, since the mechanics were something I hadn't played in years.There's no story at all, and the outfits hardly do anything to bring attention to certain places, but the game is pretty fun to kill time for an hour or so. Really don't approve of the false tag though."

This game is stupidly easy otherwise. I would call it a bug but its obviously an intentional but bad design. The music is also very annoying and loud to the point when I first started playing it I turned it down to 10% volume on all settings right off the bat then simply muted it once it became annoying.

The closest thing is a few string bikinis.You can get all the achievements in ""easy"" mode (much slower, fewer attackers than ""challenge"" mode)....and there are trading cards"
