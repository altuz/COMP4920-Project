,Not Recommended,565860,30090163,Posted: 21 February,all,"Walrus, King of the Sandwiches","The game is pretty strange, the gameplay is all over the place, and the optimization is terrible. The only thing that kept me playing was the atmosphere and the cutscenes (which are funny as ♥♥♥♥ btw).I really wanted this game to be amazing but it has so many problems that make it hard to enjoy it.- This game needs to be optimized. No question about it. I'd say I get about 15 - 25 fps while playing and I know other people have this problem too, sometimes even worse. Also, get rid of the motion blur or at least have an option to turn it off. That would probably boost fps substantially.- There needs to be more visual feedback from the game. I can never tell if my tomato is getting hurt unless I do nothing but stare at my health. I also didn't even know there were pickups until the end of the first chapter. At least make the pickups noticeable! Don't make them look like random props on a table.- The melee weapons are useless. Rework the A.I. so you don't get rekt if you decide you want to use the fork or the hammer.- Lastly, let us remap keys. Right click to reload? Really?I really like everything else though. I like the idea and the world that is here. I really hope the dev fixes these issues and actually adds some more chapters to play soon because I really like this game, but I can't recommend this in the current state it's in.""For any big, bad, crazy, motherf*cker. Dear friend. I'm in @ss. Need help. Fast."""

About the graphics, many people think its ugly, but I liked it because its weirdness. The problem is the reload, is a bit confussing but its not a big problem. In conclusion i recommend buying it if you have some extra bucks because it is cheap and worth the price."

,Recommended,565860,35278306,Posted: 28 September,all,HorizanOrganic (No sound),"DETAILED REVIEW//NO SPOILERSTomato way is as silly as it looks. As of recent, there are three episodes and an arena which you can finish in about an hour and thirty minutes. There are english subtitles, however they're spoken in a different language, it doesn't matter though, because there's only about 4-5 dialog parts in the game. (Press ESC to skip cutscenes)They dont recycle monsters as you progress in the game, infact the design of most of the characters in this game are very uniquely done, however theres not much difficulty added to the monsters, they just have a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton more health. (Not including the bosses)In all of the maps, there are little details you can often find and take part in, like breaking boxes, or exploring big♥♥♥♥♥skeletons, and breaking boxes for either powerups, or a random enemy. Yo ♥♥♥♥ the checkpoints though, I think it tells you that you've reached a checkpoint where a cutscene of the totato is swinging his massive fork in a line but I dont know, the checkpoints are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥PERFORMANCE & GRAPHICS: I cant really speak much for the graphics, they're not that impressive. The game on the other hand runs fine overall, however there are times where your frames will drop beyond the IQ of Nicole Arbor, and you will have to either die or restart the whole level to get them up again.ARENA MODE: It basically presents to you all the monsters you encounter through the game as time goes on, but it gets pretty stale after a while and is fun for about 7-13 minutes.Episode 1: This part of the game started it all. You spawn in a flat desert with a building in the middle of it, and when you walk to the end of the map, theres nothing there except a bottomless pit of which if you fall into, you'll have to restart the whole game. From there, you fight four types of disgusting looking enemies as you wander underground the bar, saving the lives of your tomato brothers and sisters, discovering a darker truth along the way.Episode 2: This map has the most detail out of either episode, and I really enjoyed exploring the map (except when my frames jumped out of a space ship all the way to the surface of Earth) Its shorter than the first episode, and is basically the same format, go here, then there, kill these guys, and go there, but it doesnt have any feelings of repetition at all.Episode 3: Its the final episode, with a very small map, and one tall building that you have to climb. I didnt really have time to see how much detail there was in the building because of annoying and god-awfully soul draining the monsters in episode are. They take your health by the twenties and they take a whole 30 rounds of a machine gun to kill, they're awful. I suggest just running to the end of the map where the extra ammo and supplies are, go back and kill the monsters, and explore the building. When you're finally ready, when you reach the top floor, you'll be experienced with a very weird and confusing boss fight, which essentially all you do is run around in a circle and fire endless amounts of bullets into it.Statement: its like an acid trip, just go along with it man, its cool.Overall, the weirdness and uniqueness of the gameplay, maps, and characters you see and meet in the game make up for the lack of exciting story and compelling fights. Its not that difficult of a game, it does have bugs here and there but it is fixable with just a simple death or restart. I thought it was hilarious all the way through, and I think a lot of people will too, however this game is definitely not for everyone. I think the idea or concept the developer had about making this game could be expanded on in a series of comics, a show, or even more games, and I hope to hear more from Tomato Way in the future."
,Recommended,565860,35401635,Posted: 1 October,all,Ronnie300Fan91 [B1gM3atYcL4wS],"This is one of those ""so bad it's good"" cringeworthy, B-level indie games with English subtitles (all spoken dialogue is in Ukrainian, I believe), disgusting models, confusing controls, and a bizarre narrative about the misdeeds done to a talking tomato and his family. And because of that, I love it. Would unironically recommend this to anyone looking for a nonsensical fever dream disguised as a game."

,Recommended,565860,32924115,Posted: 28 June,all,Jim halpert,"After playing a solid hour of this game, I can fully say that Tomato Way is the greatest game of all time.THE GAMEPLAY: The gunplay is the smoothest gunplay I have ever seen, the sword play feels real and buttery. The movement is crisp. All of the enemies feel different and unique. Imagine Skyrim times 100. There is a vast amount of weaponry that you can use. These include, but are not limted to, A Sawed Off Shotty, A Mini Uzi, And A Fork Sword.THE STORY: I'll keep it spoiler free. The main story follows around a Tomato, he is wanted by rest of the world, follow around our hero as he journys the world of Tomato Way.THE ART STYLE: The art stlye in the Tomato Way is very beutiful, now many people my say ""This game is fugly ♥♥♥♥♥"" but it is unique, not the normal snowny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in most AAA games.FINAL VERDICT: Like I said before, I truly beileve Tomato Way is the form of enterainmaint ever, I honestly feel bad for buying this game on sale, as I feel like even $200 Isn't enough to pay for this. If you have not already, please purchase this game, you will NOT regret it."

,Not Recommended,565860,34641197,Posted: 31 August,all,vodkins,Game is unplayable due to the bugs. I cannot even leave that Bar in the beginning. When i try to throw a hammer into the door to open it - hammer just disappears to nowhere forever. Door remain closed and i can't proceed further. I tried it 3 times with the same result. I give up... Why that ♥♥♥♥ing basement door just don't opens simply? Also game have no options at all. But this is no problem. Real problem for me - you can't invert Y mouse axis and author was so fair saying that he don't know how to do that:) I am really like the concept/idea and the whole setting and atmosphere but i just cannot play due to those technical issues.

The graphics in this game can be a bit cluster ♥♥♥♥y at times, and you just can't tell when you've picked stuff up or not. It lacks atmosphere, but that could be because it's in Ukrainian.One thing i noticed is, i watched Jim sterling's play through of the game after i recorded mine and we both ran out of bullets at the same time. we also both left the game feeling ""Meh"". I hate crapping on indie games, so i'll give it a thumbs up with the proviso that it is worth picking up when it goes to sale.Huck"
