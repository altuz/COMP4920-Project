Nice classic city building game with a nice greek theme. Manage your agoras, construct temples to the Gods, and war with your fellow city states. Age hasn't been kind to the game, and I'd be much more hesitant to recommend this to someone who hasn't already played and enjoyed it, but it still stands out to me as a fun and charming classic.Technically speaking, the game runs fine if a bit fast on current hardware, no widescreen support or much in the way of settings to speak of."
,Recommended,566050,28746218,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,Birb,"Oh boy, oh boy...It finally happened. One of my top 5 games of all time recently got released on Steam. I can't tell you how many hours I've spent playing the main Zeus & Poseidon campaigns, let alone the custom-made ones.The pinnacle of city builders that started with Sierra and ended with Impressions Games: The Caesar series, Pharaoh (& Cleopatra), Zeus (& Poseidon), Emperor - Rise of the Middle Kingdom, and even Children of the Nile (even though I never quite got into it). Pharaoh is also available in Steam now, so make sure you check it out, too!As for Zeus - If you want the ultimate experience, make sure you get the following things right (you don't have to, of course, but they make the game run much better on modern systems):1. Widescreen fan-made Patch-Download the following file:http://www.wsgfmedia.com/jackfuste/Zeus/Zeus.7z-Extract it.-Choose the folder with the resolution you want-Copy paste the files in the Zeus installation directory (overwrite the default ones)-Make sure you set the resolution while ingame to 1024x768, as that will trigger the patch. That's it.2. The slow god animation bug fix (not everyone experiences it equally badly, though)-Download Cheat Engine:http://www.cheatengine.organd start it.-Start Zeus, alt-tab to Cheat Engine, and select Zeus from the apps.-On the right side, there's a speed hack option. Enable it and set the value to 1 or 2.After this, the game will run a bit slower, like back when it was released - which is actually what you want. Don't forget that after this, you can still change the ingame speed (90% works fine in all cases I've come across so far. It's neither very fast, nor slow).3. Lots and lots of custom-made campaigns/adventureshttp://zeus.heavengames.com/downloads/lister.php?category=adventures_posIt's amazing to see there are people who are still working on custom-made campaigns. They also pay attention to the stories, so many of the campaigns feel like an integral part of the game. Seeing as there are new adventures coming out, it's fair to say that this game is eternal!*Lastly, I will copy a post explaining how to install the custom adventures:""If you are downloading from the Zeus download page, there will be either a Y (indicating that it is an adventure requiring Poseidon Expansion pack), or an N (indicating it does not require the expansion). Secondly, you must create a folder with the EXACT name of the pak. file in the Adventures folder. Then extract all files to the newly created folder. Also, then you must copy the pak. file directly to the adventure folder itself. Just keep at it. I know it's confusing and a little aggrevating. I had this problem myself, and it took a few tries before I realized what I needed to be doing.""Still, even if downloading custom adventures sounds too complicated, don't worry. Both Zeus and Poseidon have more than enough content to keep you going for days/weeks/months... There's even a sandbox mode where you can build cities and please the gods to your heart's content! It's the perfect combination of city building, monument building, resource management and humor. Believe me, there's lots of humor to be found while admiring the streets of your Ancient Greek cities!I'm sure I've spent hundreds of hours playing this gem. Now, I will only make those hours visible for others to see, all thanks to Steam! :D"
76561197985599207,Recommended,566050,32732341,Posted: 24 June,all,Canisgendered Translabradog,"Time flies, but this game certainly requires no further gameplay hours for me to recommend it.Somewhere around 2001-2002, my father brought back a couple of video games in PC disk format after returning home from work, one of them beingZeus: Master of Olympus. Back then, I was an eight year old kid living in a cold, often rainy town near the Swiss border who had only experienced memorable console games (mainly platform and FPS genres) to kill boredom with. It was my first encounter with a historical strategy game, and boy did it rock my world.Of course, for a young kid such as myself, it would be laughable to say I had any real grasp of effective town-management in Zeus. But the suprising thing is that you didn't really need managing skills to get fully immersed.I can still remember the terror I'd experience when an irate deity of Olympus would send his pet monster to wreck my nascent city, or worse still, use his own godly powers on my buildings and unsuspecting townsfolk. All for the terrible crime of not building an expensive temple in his honour.I can also recall the fear I'd experience when some pushy enemy would send a dozen hoplite formations at my doorstep with only a few watchmen to fend them off.Zeus was a strange, terrifying, and highly immersive world. It featured a clever combination of challenging gameplay and mythology. The voice acting was excellent. And most importantly, the music score remains one of the best I've ever heard to this date and makes up about 80% of the immersion job in this game.As for myself,Zeusinstilled in me a deep interest in Greek history and mythology at a young age. It made me want to know more about Classical history. I must confess that the music from the game would immediately resonate in my head many years later while studying Greek history at university. For me,ZeusisAncient Greece.Even when I come to think of it now, this was the best-fitting game mode for the setting: A city-builder for an era of city-states.To put it simply, this game is a gem."

It's exactly the same game and only supports 800x600 and 1024x768, no noticable changes, no Full HD nor 4K support (Though, there's a mod patch that can make it runs on higher resolutionsHere), and it's english only at the moment.

,Recommended,566050,29760996,Posted: 7 February,all,panhacker,"First of all i am the owner of this game in physical form, in GOG and in Steam. (real hours played are x10 more)So i ll try to be as objective as possible as I think this game one of the top 5 i have ever played.(I am an all around player pc+consoles since 1995)Some things about the game:The game was published by Impressions Games / Activision in 2000;and its the mental successor of Ceasar 3 and Pharaoh and Cleopatra games that came out in 1999.While Ceasar has ancient Roman setting and Pharaoh ancient Egyptian; Zeus is about ancient Greece.Game is extremely addictive.(you have been warned)ProsThe campaign is split in different scenarios making you ""Build"" various ancient Greek cities ( depending the city you get military, economy win, and different raw materials and allies/enemies and overall difficulty)Due to the nature of the game the sprites while not being HD they do not look horrible like other games from that era.Game is less than 1 GB in filesize and uses ""old school ""save system with a directory and save files in it. You can cross transfer your saves from to GOG to Steam and vice versa (done it myself).Game is playable in windows 7 and windows 10.(checked)No DLCS! everything that was ever published for the game is there. Poseidon was the official expansion for Zeus ; adding missions that have lots of water and new buildings/heroes to the existing ones.On main menu you choose if you are going to play Zeus on Poseidon - aka you cannot play Zeus campaign maps with Poseidon units/buildings.ConsThe game supports only the following resolutions :Full screen 800 x600 and 1024x768 and window mode.There is an unofficial patch for higher resolutions but when i installed it i couldnt click on anything on main menu.The Gods when they appear on the map and when they are fighting for you (e.x a monster) have ultra slow animation.Steam overlay does not work correctly on the game. If someone speaks to you on chat you have to alt-tab to see the message.The cheats work randomly.The default animation speed (in options ) is 90% ; if you put it to 100% the speed of units is so fast that you want to vomit.So it is usable for a limited time before passing out :)People are still playing it in 2017.Not that many games can boast this achievement.These HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of people that have played this game CANT BE WRONG!

Just to earn more money without doing anything; they found old games and said to themselves; let's just publish this old game on steam; its somehow get a fanbase who are going to put the price to get it and we don't need to do♥♥♥♥♥♥ easy money.To answer to some comments;I bought the game on GOG and all the problems are the same and remains; go on every forum and fan base about the game and you will see. The game has no real working patch who work for every one, the trick with cheat engine is a trick; it's just about activating the spead hack but it is not %100 solving the problem of gods and create others; very recently there is a new trick with  BES (Battle Encoder Shirase) but again, even if it is working even more than the cheat engine trick; it still one and it is only approching the original gameplay not equaling it."

It certainly lives up to the others in the series! I'd describe it as a cross between Pharoah and Emperor. The scale of the people/buildings resemble Pharoah, and the size of the maps and gameplay is more like Emperor. If you enjoyed any of the other games in the series you will enjoy this one. The gameplay is fun and challenging but easy to follow. The graphics and sound are clear and fitting to the historical period. As in Pharoah, some names of the people are puns on their profession which always raises a smile. This will be a game I play again and again through the years. The only cons are very minor - there could be more variations of the decorative structures like the parks and flower gardens, the strong American accents of the people can be a little jarring and there is little music. However these do not detract from the overall pleasure of playing this game. If you want another little historical city builder to add to your collection, this is definitely one to get."

If you have not gathered by the names alone.  This game places you in the universe of greek mythology.  You are the new ruler of famous greek cities.  You build them, make temples for various gods, summon heros to battle monsters, work around and surive natural and godly disasture and protect your city from other hostle cities.Ok, so this is the game.  Before you buy take into account this is an old game.  Well over 15 years old.  I got it cause it was one of my favorite games back in the day and can be addictive.  It is a lot of fun if you like sim/city management games.  The little people also have lines of spoken diologe along with the gods.  The graphics are a little dated but considering a lot of the ""indie/early access"" games coming out lately.  The graphis are on par.I love this game.  It was fun 15 years ago.  It is still fun.  It can even be a good challenge most of the time.  One map I was on was small with little room to build a city.  I had to also had less room to build if I wanted to prevent Talos (greek iron golem guy) from distroying my stuff.  I also had to work around the requirements needed to summon a hero to defeat Talos.  He required several battle ship ports which required lots of workers as well as elite horse soldiers in my city.  Elite housing took up space and did not provide extra workers.  Not to mention they require all the luxuries.  So basically I had to design a very tight and compact city to get me as many workers I could.  While leaving enough room to build luxary estates for the rich upperclass and keep them happy.  Doing all this on a small map while avoiding the attenion of a monster who would destroy everything I built.This was just one part of ONE adventure set you could do.  In the Zeus game.  That's not even part of the Poseidon expantion that included more stuff to build, pyramids, and even more challenges.LOVE THIS GAME!"

Game is very simple, but for new players it might be a little hard if they don't know what they should do to make their city bigger and have a decent income. If player want their city to flourish they need to have food, good hygiene in the city, building materials for the temples, agoras for the shops, enough warehouses and granaries, industrial buildings for production, trade with other cities, good culture and beautiful decorations (yes you readed it right). Otherwise workers won't move in to players city and houses won't upgrade. There's also battle element in the game, but it's also very simple in this game: if monster attacks you need a hero to kill it so build a Hero Hall and do all the requirements to get the hero to move in to your city, if god attacks you need a stronger god to beat him/her so build a temple and if some other city attacks just order your soldiers to attack.

This would be annoying, but not gamebreaking, except for the fact that this bug affects urchin harvesters as well. This makes any mission where you have to rely on urchins as a primary food source virtually unwinnable. Unless this gets patched (and from what I read, activision really has no desire to do so), I sadly cannot recommend this version of the game.Edit: there is a fan fix for the bug in the comments! Although activision is still less than stellar, the game is now worth buying in my opinion!"

Some work could be done with windows vista or newer where the God's spawn correctly. Only in XP or earlier did they spawn normally. EITHER Way i'm going to be putting in hours into this to re-complete campeign's. I hope we can soon make our own and maybe share them on steam for other's to try!

No such luck. As it is, the game is not W10-compatible (and perhaps not even W7- or XP-compatible according to the countless forum threads on the subject of these bugs--there are workarounds that may or may not work for you, they did not for me), so thanks a lot Steam for the false advertising, and thanks license holder Activision for not giving a damn about the quality of your merchandise."

,Not Recommended,566050,33235934,Posted: 4 July,all,NAPOLEAN BRONAPARTE: BROPEROR,"I love this game and logged many hours into it years ago but I can't recommend it. After a few hours of troubleshooting I can safely say that it simply doesn't run on Windows 10. Those of you who were like me and wanted the nostalgia fix from this great game, save your money unless you're still running windows xp.Update: I finally found out what was causing the issue. The intro video was cause of the continuous BSOD crashes. Deleting the BINK folder allows the game to run, but not entirely bug free. The game is apparently untouched from when it was released and contains no updates to resolution settings or to the same old gameplay bugs. Overall, I still can't recommend it since I believe games should just work without this kind of manual intervention but if these aren't deal breakers for you then you'll find the same old game waiting for you."
