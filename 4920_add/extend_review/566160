,Recommended,566160,35140190,Posted: 22 September,all,Kapot,"Yeah... It's still the same achievement farming game.The new mechanic on this one is little green squares that make things jump when they roll over them.Buy it during a sale if you want to farm achievements/cards, skip it if you want to actually play a puzzle game."

However Zup games are something else, because they require some actual effort and brain cells and on top of that, ridiculously relaxing! And you could tell the developper puts in some actual effort in each one, as they keep getting better and better. Keep'em coming!"
,Recommended,566160,35210719,Posted: 25 September,all,Helevorn,"Zup! is one of my favourite physics puzzle game series ever!It features always a lot of levels and difficulty ratios, and every title adds more mechanics like teleports, jumps, new challenges at timing the exploding boxes..Don't ever underestimate these games, for only maybe the first one was quite easy; all the other one can present serious difficulties!I'd really recommend to anyone all the Zup! games!They're the perfect example on how to make a nice minimalistic puzzle game!"

,Recommended,566160,35093000,Posted: 20 September,all,GetsugaChris,"For the 7th (!) time in a row, Zup! has shown us what many puzzle games fail to do.You don't need fancy graphics to have a fun and challenging little game.Simple yet fun and totally worth the very small price.I'd recommend picking up the bundle with 7 games (approx 8h gameplay) for +- €5.10/10"

,Recommended,566160,35458004,Posted: 3 October,all,Phr0stY_D3mon,"Zup! 6 is the 7th entry in the Zup! series. The game itself is a minimalistic physics-based puzzle game in which you need to get the blue ball onto the green platforms.Pros:-This Zup! in itself feels as if it is more polished, with more thought put into the levels and this makes it actually enjoyable to play.-Simple and easy to grasp. Puzzles require more timing as opposed to actual problem solving.-It has a ton of Steam Achievements (2448 to be exact), and trading cards.-Pretty cheap at R12 (~$1), and offers a fair amount of content for the game you are getting.Cons:-Achievements pop-ups are so many and so frequent, that you often have to sit and wait before you can see what you need to do.-Game itself is relatively short, took me about an hour to finish all the puzzles.It's another Zup! game, if you know the series and enjoyed it or are just looking for a minimal little time waster, you'll love this game.7/10Accidently ReviewedFree Games?

76561198138700608,Recommended,566160,35413081,Posted: 2 October,all,Apollo Trollo,"Some games offer a little for a lot.  Like all the games that take 100 hours to finish and give you 23/40 achievements for a normal run.  Well not Zup 1-6.  How about 100 achievements per minute for finishing no challenge or mildly irritating puzzles?  Zup is your game.  The best Zup game since Zup 5.  Apollo recommends this game, 9.5/10, and if you don’t own Zup and all of its progeny, hit yourself with a heavy brick 100 times."

,Recommended,566160,35075472,Posted: 19 September,all,Kovic,"Probably my favorite of the series thus far, really enjoyed the portals and bouncing blocks being fully utilized in nearly every level.  Like the other games, the levels are designed well and the gameplay is simple and works as intended.These games continue to be a relaxing way to casually spend 30min to over an hour pending your skill level.Honestly, the achievement thing isn't even why I still buy these games.  Sure, with the first game or two the achievements are what got my attention, but now I buy them because I genuinely enjoy playing them.If you are looking for a series of games that will give you some casual fun, easy 100%, piles of achievements, and are very inexpensive... I recommend not only buying this game, but buying the bundle of all the games.*** If you're someone who simply hates on games like this because of the high achievement count, I understand where you're coming from, but please take your anger out on the truly terrible achievement spam games that are filling the Steam Store, not games like this that are actually enjoyable."

76561197989273094,Recommended,566160,35085386,Posted: 20 September,all,War,"Zup! 6 continues the trend of quick and relaxed gameplay with a copious volume of achievements. Overall, it remains a fun game with limited replayability, however, relative to it's predecessors, I found the vast majority of the puzzles to be very easy--with a significant amount of time, logged in game, to harvest my free card drops.Zup! 6 puzzles are, in large measure, focused more on player patience (with the new ""bounce/hopping"" static green blocks.Zup! 6 is enjoyable, and I hope the series continues, however, tougher puzzles would be appreciated."

76561198119555448,Recommended,566160,35080112,Posted: 20 September,all,☠Mu$tAnG☠,"I know a majority of the games on Steam that have loads of achievements can be super easy to get, but at least the Zup! games need actual thinking to get them.  This one I enjoyed playing the most since there were other things added such as portals and bouncy blocks.  I sometimes think the developer has a harder time making the puzzles rather than us beating them lol.+Things I wanna see added into the series...-a steam workshop for making your own levels (obviously complete your custom made level before publishing it so we know it's beatable)-a slightly better ""HUD""-maybe a soundtrack of the Zup! seriesMake sure you blow up anything shaped like a heart....9/10 a very good series. I would defintely buy more"

The first two or three games were fine, but this is getting out of control. It really lacks of content to be priced at 1 euro while you can finish it at approximately 20-40 mins."

,Not Recommended,566160,35103228,Posted: 21 September,all,Insane Cheese,"This game is just an easy way to get achievments. The puzzles are easy, there's about 1 hour worth of content in the game and after completing the game you gain about 2500 achievments. The game is probably about the right time for the length, but it isn't worth wasting your money for a few achievments. Get Portal or The Talos Principle if you want a good puzzle game."
