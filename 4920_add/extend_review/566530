,Recommended,566530,28780916,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,4D4M,"Excellent concept, with gameplay that was incredibly fun to play with friends.  However, after a few matches there are some obvious imbalance issues that ruin the game onward, in favor of the seeker.  Our seekers quickly adapted to just picking up and dropping as many androids as possible near the control panels, making it nearly impossible to approach them.  Could definitely use some balancing tweaks, but I'm really looking forward to playing more in the future."

I love the tactical aspect with the use of power-ups and counter attacks. The online multiplayer is lots of fun. I created a server, waited a few minutes and then had some excellent games. I highly recommend this game!"
,Recommended,566530,28477413,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,SousaKing,My daughter's and I just had a blast playing this.  It's like a really intense game of hide and seek.  It's worth a few dollars.  There is a bug right now though where the player on the monitor sometimes can't move because they are stuck in the floor.  The Vive player can pick them up and set them down and all is good again.

It worked without many issues, and was the most I've had in a while. I'm pretty sure it's currently the only asymmetrical VR multiplayer game with online. Would definitely recommend it.

,Not Recommended,566530,32244467,Posted: 7 June,all,Trigger_Trim,"I hate to have to give this one a non-recommendation as I was really looking forward to this asynchronous VR game, but after trying to play this across the internet with my brother in another state, it is clear this game really isn't worth the price they are asking.My brother purchased the PC only version (He doesn't have a VR headset) and I purchased the VR + PC version.Our initial attempt to start the game up and play was a failure.  I tried setting up a server, and he couldn't find it in the server browser.  He tried setting up the server, and I couldnt find his in the browser.  We messed around with it for a little bit before giving up dissapointed.I was determined to figure out what was going on, so I took to the discussion board here, and I tried a few things before I ran across a comment stating that we should hop into our system registry settings and make sure some obscure registry key was set to matching values on both of our computers.   Sure enough, the registry key that dictates what region servers a player connects to was set to US on my brother's machine, and UK on my machine.  We are both in the US.   So, once I copied his values into the key on my computer, we tried again.  This time, we were able to connect.Once we were in, the game was very underwhelming.   I figured for the price of 15 bucks (or 7 bucks for the PC only version) there'd be a little more meat to this one, but it is essentially identical to Panoptic (which is free) and doesn't really offer much more at all, outside of a few single shot powers that the VR player, and the PC player can use.  I didn't find the powers to be all that useful for the VR player.  The monitor player's powers are a bit more useful, as he can blind the VR player for a good 10 seconds or so, and he can become invisible for a short while.  Those things did make keeping track of the rogue much more difficult.The game boasts 3 different levels, or environments to play in.  But in my opinion, they all felt pretty much the same.  Yeah, one has a grinder you throw the rogue into, and one has a furnace you throw the rogue into , and one has an electrical beam to throw the rogue into... but they are all just a series of platforms and stairs, and some switch boxes positioned around the 4 sides of the level.  Nothing about any of the levels really stood out to me and each one just felt like the last one with a different trap to throw the rogue into.  after an hour of playing with my brother, I don't see either of us getting the urge to jump in here again.The biggest shame is that the game is completely useless unless you have someone to play with.  And the entire hour we were on the game last night, we never came across another soul playing this.  So, unless you have a friend who will play this with you whenever you want to play it, you will be purchasing a useless piece of software.  You can't even jump into a level just for funsies to see the robots walking around if you don't have a second person to hit the ""Ready"" button to start the map.   So, it's basically a main menu simulator without friends to play with.Another issue I noticed for anyone who is thinking of playing this online, it was fairly easy to notice lag coming from the rogue player, and the robot character that the rogue was controlling would lag out every now and then and the VR player can see this easily as a robot who appears to be warping several feet from time to time.  This was mostly noticeable when the rogue was running, as he covered more ground more quickly, but even walking, the lag would cause the rogue player to pop around a bit.  This didn't happen all the time, so I imagine it is very tied to connection quality, but there sure isn't any sort of smoothing algorithm in place to help prevent that popping from happening ,and it's a dead giveaway for which little robot is being controlled by the rogue.All in all, I love the idea, but this just falls flat.  If the developer has some plans to add more features, more levels of greater variety, and give players a little bit more to do, then maybe this will turn out to be something cool, but for now, for the price, I'd pass it up."

It is easy to blend in with the hundreds of other small robots, however there is an exciting twist!Both players have 3 different speical abillities that can only be used once, unless you disable that in the settings menu. The rogue can for instance blind  the oversser, and the oveerseer can freeze all robots except the player.The devolopers of this game are great, (i had an issue with it, and they fixed it within the same day).Overall i highly recommend this game, it is great fun with friends and family!"

76561198337541359,Recommended,566530,33962481,Posted: 1 August,all,Retrobuster,"Has great potential. My two biggest complaints are:1) game needs to be optimized more. I'm running GTX 1070 and a solid system to back it up and any more than 1 person playing on the TV and the game starts to stutter real bad which causes nausea.2) sneaking around is too easy. My suggestion is to control the difference between running and walking based on how far the joystick is pressed. As it is now, running is an entirely separate button which makes it too easy to NOT run and therefore, blend in. If it's more based on how much the joystick is pressed it becomes a bit more of a game of patience and skill. The player would have to consciously not press the joystick further than a walking speed in order to blend in more which coupled with the nervousness of blending in, actually could make sneaking a little more stressful in a good way.I really hope this game reaches its true potential because it can be great fun. But it looks like they've only updated it once in the past 2 months so that concerns me."

We NEVER play games late into the night these days, but this game was the first time in 5 years we realised it was 4:00am. BUT I really wish it would detect my shield controllers when connected through gamestream as to allow me to get two more friends invloved in once. THAT would be  huge, especially since I know is supports more players. I did try plugging a second nvidia shield controller into my computer (lame to have to have them plugged in at all though) and it caused trouble. The other person using the nvidia controllers screen would go blank and no other screen for the 2nd player would come up. Please, I dunno what would have to be done to enable this or how hard, but I know i gamestream to dolphin and use four of my nvidia controllers to play gamecube and wii games on the pc.

But, the local competitive aspect of the game brings out the excitement of being the hunter or the hunted.  A great party game and very easy to pick up and play.  Both sides are very fun, though the level of content currently limits replay value.It's hard to explain the tension when the watcher has its gaze upon you and you know that just one little misstep will do you in.  Conversely, it's hard to explain the tension as the last node is in danger and you've used all of your tricks to no avail.  It gets that right.So what can it use?  More maps, more interesting powers, some more sound effects, an optimization pass, and some bug fixing.  It's a complete demonstration of a concept born of Panoptic, and the price is right.  I think this is one of those dark and definitive ""here's what the Vive can do"" titles.  Go ahead and pick it up.  Even if they don't add a thing, the game is a trip to play and to watch people play."

I can't wait for more maps and maybe some tweaking to the game mechanics.  It's a must have for small friend groups or even 2 people.

76561198063913127,Recommended,566530,32518809,Posted: 17 June,all,Neutronux,"Fun game in local coop.1 Player with VR headset: From his sight of the view he's looking into a room with lots of ant like robots that move around. Looks fun. He could grab them and drop them in place. If he likes then he may drop them into some shredding machine... by uhm... mistake. There are a few consoles that are green and requires your care as some of those ants are going to turn them red. If all of them are red... you lost.Few players without VR headset. Looking via splitscreen onto the monitor or TV. From their sight of view they see some huge floating monster like head with huge robot hands. The eyes cast some volumetric fog like lightbeam. So you know the direction where he is actually looking. Your job is to be maximum annoying and turn those green consoles red. You may run but other robots do not ... so you better only run when the monster isn't looking into your direction... or just be patient and follow the robot horde until you can get near some console.We were 3 (same PC as VR headset):1. Player used mouse/keyboard2. Player used Xbox One Gamepad3. Player used some Logitech Rumblepad 2Pro:Real VR game... and not just yet another ""bow and arrow"" or ""shoot yet another horde"" simulator. If you would show your buddy VR it's something you could play togheter with your buddy.Con:Not 100% polished right now. From the sight of the VR guy it looks nice and the idea is great. But if you would play it serious for longer than a hour for fun then you would find some issues soon. You can camp those consoles too easy or just drop everything down. After you switched the role a few times there is a bit too less long term motivation too keep it going. While lokal coop works well non-VR standalone online client is too expensive in my opinion and I found no servers. It seems you can't mix lokal coop (split screen) with a further online client. So you have to get a few buddies online to play vicitim for you and you can't just switch the VR HMD in the same manner you would do (and keep playing because everybody would see it at least once through the VR HMD) in your living room."

,Recommended,566530,29467296,Posted: 24 January,all,Snugglyninja,Bought this game on a whim and did not regret a second of it. It looked great but plays even better. I'd rank this as one of my favorite VR experiences so far. Playing the rogue brings back the terrifying suspense of playing a game like hide and seek as a kid but on the scale of a giant robot with a grinder. If you want to have fun in VR with a buddy or significant other this is a fantastic game for getting everyone in the room involved rather than just watching someone swing their arms around with goggles on. The balance of the game is weighted a bit heavily on the Seeker in the current build but some patches are already working to fix that and playing the rogue was still fun every single game.
,Recommended,566530,29574511,Posted: 29 January,all,mandrake,"This game is really ridiculously fun.  This game goes into my ""must-have"" category for folks picking up or playing a VR game for the first time.  We played on a high end PC with an HTC vive hooked up to it.The Good:-----------This game has tremendous multiplayer potential.  We played multiplayer for 3 hours without even noticing we had spent that much time playing.Both sides, hider and seeker, have drastically different user interfaces and play styles.  But both are equally fun to play, and can be equally stressful.The graphics quality is fantastic - put your head down at the level of the little robots running around, and they still look stunning.Seeing the seeker looking around and noticing you when you're hiding can definitely startle you!  Watching the head / eyes / etc swing around is both stressful and exhilirating!Gameplay can get fast and frantic when you're trying to nail your opponent.The Bad:----------The game is HIGHLY skewed towards the seeker winning.  When you've disabled 3 / 4 of the switches as the hider, it can get insanely difficult.  If the devs are reading this, the far left switch that has two long staircases to get there - while intense and fun to actually get the switch and survive - almost requires using 2/3 of your special abilities in order to get away.  It's far too easy as the seeker to just pick every single robot up and chuck them away and grind a robot every so often that is heading up one of the two staircases.I would love more than one map available.  Or, and this would be fantastic, make the maps randomly generate around the seeker.One MINOR nitpick is that we had to use the PC speakers for both of us.  Would have been better if the vive headset AND the PC could have sound.  Maybe there was a way to do this but it wasn't immediately obvious.Let us have the robots playing across the network (multiple robot opponents would also have been fantastic, saw this is coming in a future patch - looking forward to that!)The Ugly:----------Nothing really bad about this game to put in this area.  Needs more content maybe?  Still a freaking great game.all in all I'd rate this a big thumbs up - if you're picking up VR games and have friends who get jealous, invite them over and play this game with them.

Even Mom might try it.I have a GTX1070 and a Ryzen 7, with an Oculus rift, looks like buttah.I appreciated a couple of other reviews pointing out the need for some balancing and bug fixing, but given the amount of fun this is worth for the price, I can't complain.The Seeker user is shown diagrams of the Vive remote, so we had to figure out the Touch on our own. Also, the start room has a bug in it where the Seeker has to press their button twice sometimes.Also, we haven't found what to do with the floating gears, or how to have split screen rouges...This should be on the top of your list, especially for showing all your VR-less friends."

Would be fantastic to see networked play, maybe even multiple robots versus multiple seekers in bigger levels! The gameplay is really solid, and creative, so there's heaps of potential here, but it's also a very good party game as it is currently.The game works fine on the Oculus Rift, but it could use better instructions (everything is currently aimed at Vive users), although I was able to figure it out in less than 5 minutes."

76561198314375705,Recommended,566530,31675973,Posted: 10 May,all,timguyperson,"I'll be refunding this game because it is so choppy with the reprojection.System is a i76700k with a gtx1080 strix, 16gb ram, win 10, nvidia drivers updated with the May update. Reprojection even when the gtx is overclocked. 1st level reprojection kicks in a little, second level reprojection is constant. Fyi you can check reprojection by moving your controller around in front of you. It will be flashy chopping in and out as you move it rather than being a constant like it is when it's 90fps.Developer says it works on other cards fine, so maybe it's just a weird thing with my system. If it works on your system without reprojection then I recommend this game. Very cool concept and I like the local multiplayer.Will purchase it again if the developer fixes the bug that I am getting.Thanks"
76561198035654693,Recommended,566530,34915718,Posted: 13 September,all,P90Enthusiast,"This game is a must have for owners with required hardware! The only down-side is the fact that there isn't really an online community and it is hard to find someone with a VR headset to play against. The graphics are beautiful for what it is and the game can either make you feel larger than life, or as tiny as an ant depending on your playing perspective as either the seeker (VR) or a rogue android (No VR). The view from the seeker perspective is amazing and its hard to describe how many gosh dang androids there are (a **** ton). I personally believe the most fun to be had is on a LAN network with good friends or family and like some commenters, I think it is one of the best asymmetrical VR games out there. Buy it already so i can play!just an update: There was a recent update that for whatever reason made it very difficult to play as the seeker. The grab and place mechanics are a litte screwy and after finding just one android playing as the seeker, the game is won, which i am not a fan of. seeing as there was an update, I do have faith that some bugs will be worked out."

Despite having gotten it on discount.Full video review here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI_yyw5bPa4&feature=youtu.beLong story short, the game is way too hard for the seeker.The powerups offer very limited help. There is no way to tell who in the sea of NPCs around you is the computer player, because they are all running around everywhere.Unless the hider does something stupid like run, they have no way or reason to stick out from the crowd.The game was confusing even after watching the tutorial (see the video review to see where exactly I struggled)The only thing that can help you figure out who in this giant sea of randomly generated characters is your power ups.Except... You get three. And only two of them are in any way useful. And you can only use them once. And they don't recharge. And even if you do magically manage to use your powerups and locate the player - they get powerups too that makes getting away from you pretty easy.Now, I saw a video with some magical settings that let you turn on powerup recharges or bascially give the seeker less cooldowns to balance the game a bit more in his favor but... I couldn't seem to find this mystery menu anywhere. And I looked.I found myself forcing the people I was playing with to start giving me hints or saying ""warmer/colder"", or actively sprinting, just so I'd have a chance of knowing who they are.What this game needs is:-A clearer location for the game settings menu-Something that lets you know who the hiding player is (like an area that they have to walk through that NPCs don't walk through, or at the very least, a clear beginning middle and end to each level)-Recharging powerupsUntil then, this is basically just a game about grabbing random people off catwalks and throwing them into a grinder hoping one of them is the person you're looking for.When they make the necessary changes this game could easily be great. But for now I can't recommend it and have asked for a refund. Which makes me sad becasue the concept is fantastic and I love that there is a VR game that you can play online with friends who don't even have VR."
,Not Recommended,566530,29570896,Posted: 29 January,all,Alex7900,"Way too simple. The gameplay concept is great, but the execution is sorely lacking. There is just too much rough around the edges, and there is no variety whatsoever. This game has potential to be awesome, but it's just too bland right now. If it wasn't for the nice graphics and presentation, this wouldn't be more than a low effort technical demo.Gameplay wise, I feel like the ""powerup"" system is just completely flawed. You only get one use per game, after which point you can't interact with the world at all anymore. All you can do is wait around staring at the little robots to try and spot the other player. It just becomes boring after that. I don't see how you can call this a party game when the players start falling asleep while playing. Plus, really the only way other people can have fun watching this game is by trying to call out the non-VR player's position, which totally defeats the purpose of the game,Since it is early access, I'm not going to refund it. Even though I don't generally buy early access games, I caved with this one because I was desperate for a good party game. However, I won't be recommending this until they add more features and polish it up some more."

While appearing pretty amaturish, it had quite a lot of potential. Describe the concept to people, and they'll think it's pretty fun. A person in VR has to find 1 (or more) human players hiding among dozens of AI robots, while the player(s) have to flip some switches to kill(?) the VR player.I played it, and yeah, it was OK.I thought it would be fun to play with a friend, so purchased a second (PC Client) copy and sent it to them. I then booted up my version, and found that suddenly it's been downgraded to a PC only version. I could not longer play in VR.I contacted the dev about this, and they told me that it's my problem and that I needed to ask Steam to fix it. I asked them if they were going to do anything to fix it and said that they should contact Steam, and they replied that they can't change it.So yeah, I now own 2 PC only versions of the game after buying 1 PC version and 1 more expensive VR version.While investigating, I also found out that if you buy the PC version, there's NO WAY to upgrade to the VR version, unless you email Steam and/or(?) the developer.While the developer has shown an interest in updating the game further, they considered the game finished in May. In my opinion, the following reasons suggest why it isn't:1) When the players beat the VR player, the game doesn't end2) When the players beat the VR player, a white box is placed around their view so they can't see anything. If they get close enough to a surface, it comes through the box and you can see it again.3) When you choose to play the game with a GamePad, the game shows you only the PC controlsThere's probably more, but I think I'm finally done with the game.I originally bought it on its release and found it really broken, so refunded it. Then when they announced a patch I thought I'd give them another shot.After this time, however, I can't do it again. I've applied for my last refund. I just hope I get it."
