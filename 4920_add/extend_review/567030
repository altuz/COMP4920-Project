You click on an animal, it gives you an item to find x# of, and then you search the environment for that item. It won't be just one page you're searching and herein lies the challenge. If you get stuck, you'll be looking over multiple scenes multiple times. Under Leaves starts easy but later levels can be quite challenging. At least for me. :p The graphics are unique and beautiful and the music is relaxing and fits each area. You should probably buy this on sale because of the short game length but, if you're a hidden object fan, Under Leaves should definitely be in your library."
,Recommended,567030,32825913,Posted: 26 June,all,Kitty,"So, time to leave a review!Under Leaves reminds me the game Morphopolis. It's the same type of game. Only, I prefer this one.I was attracted to this game because of its design: it's cute, it looks like watercolor painting, and I love all things painting. Achievements, just like the design, are super cute. In-game music is relaxing.I bought Under Leaves during the sales. I don't regret it. Some will find the game is too short to be paid at its full price, I don't know. But yes, Under Leaves is a bit short, and there isn't much replayability. But I do recommend it.At first I told myself, ""bah, it looks easy!"" The goal is to find the pieces the animal asks you to find, and those are hidden in the background. Yeah, it was really easy...the first few levels. After that, it can become really hard to find everything, especially since the pieces you have to find have the same shades of colors as the background. So...not that easy heh.To sum up everything:Pros- Family-friendly- Watercolor painting design- Very nice achievements- Music- Difficulty increased after the first levelsCons- A bit short (to my taste)- Not much replayability"

,Recommended,567030,31437877,Posted: 29 April,all,♡olivboo♡,"This is a cute hidden object game. You are moving through a forest/ jungle/ savannah/ bottom of the ocean etc. exploring the habitat of different animals. The goal is to find various different items for each creature (fish for a polar bear etc.) The game is very simple though it can be hard to find some of the objects at times as they all blend so well with the environment. There is a hint button in form of a sliding puzzle if you get stuck. The location of the items changes slightly with every play through so the game has some  replayability.The game is visually beautiful. The blend of watercolor illustrations and subtle music sets a very relaxing tone.I'd not recommend the game to those who like story driven or action filled games as there is none of that in here. It's a more relaxing, meditative, anxiety-reducing kind of game. Good for young children or those who want to unwind for a bit."

Even as an adult I had difficulties to find all animals, especially the snake level was hard for me (try to find green salamanders in the green forest ...). For kids it is simple to play and the music and ambient sound create the feeling as if you are really in that environment. And the artwork is perfect for children! Realistic but sweet. Love the game!"
,Recommended,567030,31715112,Posted: 12 May,all,Levia Draconia,"Neat little game.It's really easy at the beginning, but gets more difficult with each level.I beat it in less than an hour, but really enjoyed the art."
,Recommended,567030,33023693,Posted: 29 June,all,ElusiveOne,"Under Leavescan be pleasantly relaxing if approached without grand expectations. Beautiful, short, unpretentious.Seek simple patterns concealed in a handful of lovely animated watercolor environments, always solely looking for one thing at a time. Complete collections to reveal tiny additions to the world in splatters of complementary color, and unlock the next one.PositiveSuperbly delicate artwork.Cute animals and charming environments.Relaxing ambiant soundtrack and sounds of nature.Simple controls: drag to scroll, double-click to zoom.Optionally solve a sliding tile puzzle to receive a hint.NegativeNo puzzles or emerging challenges: everything is in plain sight.Unfairly same-colored items layered over monochromatic backgrounds may be difficult to spot for younger kids or players with limited eyesight.Extremely short at full price (less than 2 hours of content)."
,Recommended,567030,33382460,Posted: 8 July,all,MashPotato,"After playing Hidden Folks I was in the mood for more hidden object games in that vein, and Under Leaves mostly delivers in that aspect albeit in a much simpler way. The game is relaxing and lovely, with a charming picturebook art style and ambient soundtrack. However, don't go in to this game looking for a challenge--while it does get a little trickier in the later levels, it will not take long to go through the game, and what you see is what you get as there are no interactive areas or puzzles to solve. Sometimes, however, short and simple is all you want!"

,Recommended,567030,32784914,Posted: 25 June,all,Idunhaël,"This is such a nice game with a calming atmosphere and very pretty artwork. Some respire from the hectic action games!Does not have need of language, that means even small children could play it."
,Recommended,567030,32914428,Posted: 27 June,all,WViperShark,I really enjoyed this game! Calming music and just an overall neat find! make more levels
,Recommended,567030,31630888,Posted: 8 May,all,Angahareth,"Adorable game, although really short. I wish there was more, as is I'm not sure it's worth full price. But if it's on sale, it is great.One other thing that bothered me was that it wasn't possible to change the volumes of the music and sound effects. The music's good, but since the game is more repetitive, I wanted to listen to a podcast, but couldn't turn off the music without turning off sound effects."

,Recommended,567030,31717551,Posted: 13 May,all,Gnome,"*Gnome Seal of Approval*Took 90 minutes to complete for me. I think that makes it worth its price. Some may disagree.The game itself is really simple for a hidden objects game. It sure could benefit from more variety, but I still recommend it for fans of the genre."
76561198165729622,Recommended,567030,31440928,Posted: 29 April,all,AlphaCommander42,Absolutely beautiful little game. It shows us the wonderful creatures that exist on our planet.

76561198054469963,Recommended,567030,31527053,Posted: 3 May,all,rymalla,"Especially recommended for children since the UI requires no reading and the material is suitable for all ages.With cute watercolour aesthetic, nature sounds and clever use of camourflage, this is an absolute delight! I wish more hidden object games were along these lines.  Objects are also found in logical, or should I say natural, places. No moonlogic to be found. It is rather short if you have a keen eye or play a lot of this genre."
,Recommended,567030,31503757,Posted: 2 May,all,jillian1204,Very nice and relaxing game. The layers keep adding up to the scenery once you progress through the game. The help function is nice too (in order to get the hint you have to complete a puzzle). Some of the things to find are quite difficult while some are easier.For about 4 euros this game is a bit too short. I would love to see more levels to this game later. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a brain tease game which will relax you as well.
,Recommended,567030,31538538,Posted: 4 May,all,Ferks,"I have two problems with this game.First, also the biggest problem for me, is when the ambient music loops, it's very obvious. The music and ambience is beautiful, however when it cuts for a second to loop it really takes me out of it.Second is the lack of options. It isn't too big of a deal, but a music slider and the option to disable hints would be nice.Other than those issues, I like this game. It's surprisingly challenging, the music is nice, and it really makes you appreciate the attention to detail in the wonderfully illustrated scenes."
,Recommended,567030,31770795,Posted: 15 May,all,MadameHardy,"This is immensely soothing.  I was looking for a relaxing game, and searching for shapes in beautiful water-colored scenes with pleasant music was just what I needed.  A small detail that I really appreciated was that objects only appeared in biologically suitable places:  acorns could be found only on the ground or in an oak branch, each flower could appear only on certain types of branches, and so on.   I'm really glad I bought this game."
76561198020570262,Recommended,567030,32470275,Posted: 16 June,all,foolbunny,"Under Leaves is a beautiful, hidden object game with a soothing soundscape and simple play mechanism. The game does not take long to complete (I've played through twice in my first go), but it is charming and relaxing. I think that this would be a terrific game for children, particularly to join with your child and play together.  As an adult, this will get replayed more for the calming effect than for a challenge."
