,Recommended,567060,29894945,Posted: 13 February,all,SidAlpha,"https://youtu.be/EUkC_P3cwFII have to admit that, in spite of this being an unfinished title, I ended up having a great deal of fun with it. The Dev shows that they have a solid grasp on what makes FPS games of this type fun and interesting. With good level design and well placed ammo, health, and shield drops the game keeps a good pace. The gameplay is fluid and well done. All in all, it is a solid start to a promising title.It is, of course, not without it's cons. Framerate ran at a constant 36-39 fps which is low, to my mind. It also has random bugs and the hit boxes are ridiculously tiny and require near pinpoint accuracy. However, I would expect a good deal of that to be sorted by the time the game launches into a full release. And, given the disclosed progress on the game, I have little doubt it will reach the final release stage.A great start and a solid title. I had no issue recommending it to my viewers."

Doesn't bother me but I know people who hate dated graphics.Occasionally when looking for a secret you can jump into an nook and get stuck. Then you have to reload a checkpoint.The machine gun isn't fun to shoot.

,Recommended,567060,33971354,Posted: 2 August,all,T00LoftheSystem,"Think of this games as a lackluster Serious Sam. It has the same feel as a Serious Sam game, things just don't come together as smoothly as they do with Sam. I would give this rating a ""neutral"" if possible, a ""yes"" if you really enjoy Serious Sam - type FPS, and a ""no"" if you like higher quality shooters a la Crysis, Far Cry, Bio Shock, etc.Considering this was a one man job and I can't say that it wasn't enjoyable. I would ultimately recommend buying this game when it's on sale."

This ones a bit more polished, but it keeps crashing at the first level in the 2nd act, or whatever you wanna call it. When the undead looking Nazi type things appear. In the error log it seems to be saying somthing about my memory and the paging file. I know its early access though and it'll get better. Love the double jump and the fluid movement. The dynamite is fun to use. The explosion looks pretty cool and the extra gore is nice."
76561198022370609,Recommended,567060,32203351,Posted: 5 June,all,Tiny Trees,"I just updated my review to positive, but with a more low neutral rating. (Odd reservations too.)I bought the first Putrefaction game, for about £1 and loved it. (Even though it's only about 1.5 hours to complete.)I bought P2: The Void Walker, for £3.74 as I just noticed and it was on sale. I was dubious about spending almost £4 initially, only because P1 was short at about one hour's play. (P2 is probably about six hours max play including finding secrets.)I iniitally gave a negative review because I found a game-breaking bug. It was in the area where your in a dark building with lots of green light markings on the walls. ...However the developer asked me straight away, ""Where was the bug?"".......Then the developer fixed it as soon as I said where. ... However the developer annoyed me by contacting regularly to retest the bug and update review. Even befriending me on Steam. Then once I put a positive rating on the game, the developer ignored me. I dropped the developer as a Steam friend.OK Putrifaction 2 is quite short at about five hours. Yet so are some AAA titles that cost £35. Therefor I have no choice but to offer now a positive review. P2 might no be AAA shiney. However but it's more than playable, and some areas are right on.Some other things about P2 that seem like they should be fixed:1. Mouse scroll should change weapons, because being forced to move hands to number keys, is risky under fire.2. Enemies which appear to be not close enough, do damage, making it tricky to judge play sometimes. This is the animal type enemies, like wolves.3. There's a hard room near the end. You have to make a jump to get to an exit platform. I died so many times trying to make that jump, forcing me to replay the whole room. (I had to google to find out if that actually was the way out, and if it could be jumped.)4. Earlier on, you are a slightly mazy area. You have to collect tablets. However it doesn't save when you return the tablets to where they are supposed to be. It saves when you pick some of the tablets up. Meaning at one point I was repeatedly dying and having to take a tablet and deliver it, then go on to the next. In a toughish game, in a mazy area, I was getting real mad when I was dying and having to do it again. I almost went for refund at that point.5. I can not beat the last boss on the difficulty that I played this game. Hard sort of setting I think.6. It does someties feel generic. However there's enough to keep you going."

76561198064148798,Recommended,567060,34127842,Posted: 9 August,all,DaDrunkenJester,"For our full impressions of Putrefaction 2: Void Walker and how it earned our Wiseau Award please visit:Way Too Many GamesPutrefaction 2 is a classic first-person shooter; no ADS, no aim assist, and no reloading. It’s all about fast paced action and blasting enemies in the face. It is a style of FPS that has been missing as of late due to a stronger focus on narratives and more casual aiming methods. And I for one am glad to see some classic FPS games coming back, especially with the recent DOOM revival.You’re given a nice array of weapons and while I wish there were more of the cool alien type weapons, they vary up the more traditional revolver and shotgun type guns by adding modifiers. You collect upgrade orbs by killing enemies which can be used to infuse and upgrade your weapon strength. For example with the shotgun you can either add a charged up fire blast or rapid fire and then there are also sub upgrades to reduce cool downs and faster charge rates. You’ll also be able to upgrade player stats such as total health, armor, ammo capacity, movement speed and item drop rate from enemies.Now, everything isn’t perfect in Putrefaction 2. In fact it does have a handful of problems. The graphics are nothing special, animations and AI are pretty damn bad and some enemy projectiles will clip through walls and still hit you. But it was so easy to overlook these problems because the gunplay and enemies are so wacky and over the top I just kept wanting to play! If you’re looking for a fun, ridiculous, classic FPS where you just want to blast enemy heads and limbs off and have a good time, I recommend grabbing Putrefaction 2: Void Walker."

You get to move around fast, jump around and shoot while the main character just keeps smacktalking with repeated lines over and over again, what is there not to love?Alright, sure, let's be fair. THe game looks a bit clumsy at the times, especially the enemies, and you can get stuck to tight spaces. But hey, Serious Sam looked clumsy too, it's not the looks.And the game is sadly a bi too short, just one more hour would've given me all I could want. But hey, this guy made a huge improvement from the first Putrefaction, and I liked that game too, maybe his next game will be even better. Here's hoping, Dragon out!"

Does not have the fine tuned graphics of the big developers but worth your time playing. A lot of action and gameplay. I am having problem locating entrance to caves on level 5. Have played through 3 time and just must be missing the spot. Support this developer
,Recommended,567060,34173765,Posted: 11 August,all,Paindemonium,"Putrefaction 1 was nice, small indie DOOM a like FPS game. Now we got Putrefaction 2, at least price become higher, but I get it for 1.5 euro from promo (selling cards :P). Now this game looks like small, indie, SErious Sam clone. Not so well, but good enouth for this price for getting good fun. There is not so many contet, weapons and enemies but its bloody and fun. We get also voice acting that is sovering like Sam ""Serious"" Stone alike :). Not bad, but not perfect. I give this game 7/10 and playing more to finish campaing."
76561198135093487,Recommended,567060,29514792,Posted: 26 January,all,Awesreek,"putrefaction 2 is an fps that attempts to recapture the magic of the 90s shooter, it's not finished yet, having 5 levels all of which however are decent in length. It's a really fun game marred by bugs at the moment, but thankfully none of the ones that I've encountered have been horifically game breaking. comparing it to other games, I'd say its quake 2 meets painkiller/serious sam and turok the dinosaur hunter.Pro's:The game is fun, fast and fluid. Movement feels good most of the time, (though I'll touch on that in the cons) and the weapons are all fun to use.All enemies use projectile weapons, not a bloody hitscamming enemy in sight. (thank bloody God)Every level thus far is unique, and whilst they typically adhere to a theme they all look and feel different.The level design is open and non linear, there's gibs and blood, no taking cover, no reloading, it's classic 90s fun.Con's:The game is buggy, enemies phasing through the environment at times and getting stuck on nothing, and the hit detection doesn't always seem to work.I've gotten stuck on pieces of the environment, especially level 5.level 5 has halls that are to cramped and short.The shotguns animation doesn't link up with it's audio, as the player ♥♥♥♥♥ the gun before the sound even plays.The third level has a boss, which is a passable boss, not great but not bad. But what destroys it is that your given no ammo before entering, and the ammo present in the area isn't enough to get by on. I scoured the level just to get all the ammo I could before entering, and by the time I had beaten it, I was completely out of ammo for all but a measly 10 with my pistol, and I had to fall back on the boss rooms resources. Meaning even the extra ammo was barely enough.I'm packing a gtx 1070, and this game still dips in the framerate department on occasion, especially in level 5.This games visuals are... inconsistent. It has no solid style, with some enemies and weapons looking pretty cartoonish when compared to the rest.Some of the environments are baron, just large open spaces with nothing.Verdict:whilst its had its problems, its an early build, so issues are expected. I enjoyed my time with the game thus far, and can't wait to see what's yet to come.Seriously though, hammer down on the bugs, they're not game breaking but they are painfully noticable and mildly irritating."

,Not Recommended,567060,34206504,Posted: 12 August,all,Poutini,"Fast paced and stupid, though plays all right. Like a modern day ROTT more than anything else. I wouldn't (and didn't) pay more than $1 for this."
,Recommended,567060,29405429,Posted: 21 January,all,vodkins,"Even in such early state game deserves attention for sure! Here we have almost all for meat/arcade shooter like Sam or Turok. On very high settings i have no slowdowns or freezing. And no crashes at all! Game marked as alpha but it already have a lot of options, including such a rare stuff like mouse invert and sens, rebind of the keys and FOV slider. I like it when developer like me as a player and gives me these needful options! Gameplay is fun and balanced (we have 4 or 5 difficulty levels). Weapons are not something new, but you can upgrade them. Same for player's stats. So here we got some RPG stuff also. Monsters are cool and not stupid. They can strafe, crouch, avoid and even jump to you on higher locations! Graphics are not the high-end, but this is not neccessary or main aspect here, because playing is fun itself. Sounds are good, but could be better. 104 achievments for you, if all this is not enough.Only one major aspect that i really can call something bad for now - physics of the player in some tight places. You can stuck in some rocks in searching for secrets. But author promised to cure it soon. Other issues are even not deserve to talk about. Oh, and remember that this game in development by only one person and he is surely talented one! He listen to players and make fixes very soon. So i strongly recommend this game for every arcade/oldschool shooter fanatic, especially for such price. For now we have 5 big levels and this is enough to catch you for 4-5 hours of bloody massacre. Keep it going, Oleg!!!"

Its not even finished yet and it is awesome.  One of the things not shown off in the trailer is the weapons upgrade system.  You can upgrade your weapons and add a ton of new abilities, and so far, all the ones I've seen, have a cool new animation to go along with them!  Unfortunitally the ability to upgrade your character appears to not yet be implimented, but when it is, it will add even better RPG elements to this game.Do not let the bright colors full you, Putrefaction 2 is a dark game, in many ways every bit as dark as the first one, and it certianly rivels the original when it comes to blood and gore!  It is fun, and awesome.  I really hope they finish this game soon so I can beat it, and find out how the story ends.   Its a great arcade style first person Shooter, especially for the price.  Hopefully it won't go up too much in price when its no longer in early access.  Even without being finished, it surpasses the first Putrefaction.  Its not as creepy so far, but its just as violent, and gruesome!Oh and one more thing, I didn't realize this at first, but there is a malee attack button, that you can use if you're low on ammunition, however it switches your gun back to the pistal, so keep that in mind."

,Recommended,567060,29427866,Posted: 22 January,all,Mr Oujamaflip,"Putrefaction 2 Void Walker is an early access first person shooter inspired by the FPS games of the 90s like Doom, Serious Sam or Duke Nukem. This means you’re running around super fast shooting basically anything you see.The shooting can feel a bit floaty due to the mouse acceleration but turning the sensitivity down helped a lot but even with this the guns don’t feel great. They have very little feedback like recoil and while they’re reasonable modelled and animated some more oomph behind them would go a long way. There’s no reloading either which removes some of the effort in the game since you can basically shoot forever but this does go alongside the early FPS games so I’m not too concerned about that. The music is decent as are the gun sounds and the enemies make your usual monstery grunts and stuff so that’s pretty solid. The enemies at first look quite a lot like the Imps in Oblivion but they get more varied as you progress adding in guys with spears, shields, dog things and so on. The shielders are cool since the shields block incoming fire a lot but the AI isn’t really clever enough to make use of it but a little work could get a lot more out of them. I also found myself getting caught on corners of objects a lot and I got stuck three times while jumping around causing me to go back to the last checkpoint.The grammar is interesting too. A lot of unnecessary commas! The developer – a guy called Oleg Kazakov evidently isn’t an English speaker so this isn’t too big of a concern either but something to look at before the full release. HE’s also responded to a few Steam reviews already so it seems like he’s making a conscious effort to improve the game which is a good sign. Overall though as far as first person shooters go, this is one of them. A clear homage to the FPS games of the 90s but also nothing really remarkable but for under a fiver what would you expect?If you want to watch my video review with some gameplay as well it's here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOxii7MNvF4"

This game is a lot of fun.For me it's bringing back vibes of Serious Sam as well as other old school shooters.The controls feel nice, helping with the fast action. My only qualms right now is that perhaps hitboxes are too small for the fast pace of the game, that or I just suck at hitting enemies and that you can just avoid all enemies and run to the objectives.Check it out, and also feel free to check out my gameplay vid for more impressions and information:https://youtu.be/635ZhnSRc78"
,Recommended,567060,29381042,Posted: 20 January,all,riotsquad,"Ok, I think it's time to change the review to a positive one now as it's in a state of early access where it feels like early access - which it didn't on Win 10 previously.I did notice the framerate being a bit low (just standing still I hovered around 50 with i5 6400, RX480 8GB) but it is still alpha so I'm sure that'll get fixed too. (turning off AA did help a lot)Other than that it is a hord based FPS - apparently like Sewrious Sam, I never did play that a lot so... - and if you do like pure chaotic hoard-mode action, try the survival mode with all weapons and unlimited ammo, that's great. :)Oh, yeah, one other thing that I didn't notice before, you can upgrade your weapons and character, sort of like Watch_dogs, GTA V and those, (increase health, reload times and minor things....you can't turn your boomstick into a BFG though....not yet at least... :) )"
