,Recommended,567130,31487114,Posted: 1 May,all,CorvusCorax,"In case you are new to BoogeymanIn Boogeyman we are bound to our bed armed only with a flashlight to get rid of the boogeyman. He can come from the cupboard, through the vent and even from the outside via the window on the left-hand side. A quick glance at him with our torch turned on is enough to shoo him away. But of course he will return.The goal is to survive the night by staying unharmed till 6 AM. The game uses a handful of distractions such as weather effects or the bedroom toys that suddenly turn on and start playing. What makes the game terrifying is the constant need to charge our flashlight - this requires us going under the bed for a while which means we are unaware of what's happening in the room.The game is excellent for the VR and the floating menus also take it granted that we have the necessary equipment to play. Note that you can start by playing the 2nd game already - the two are not connected in terms of storyline (which is very minimalistic).If you have already played and liked the first oneBoogeyman returns with enhanced graphics and a bedroom with a different layout. The cupboard, now, is on the right-hand side and in front of us on the shelf at the other end of the room there's a power bar showing the strengh of our flashlight. This is a great help since looking ahead is still the most important thing we have to do in order to cover many entry points.The skinny, ugly-looking creature with the claws has been replaced by a bigger, furry enemy with a hat on top of his head. He still looks terrifying, though. Instead of going under the bed we turn away to do the charging on the bedside table.  As usual the more nights we survive the more tricks he has up in his sleeve - one night our dog appears and comes on the bed so that he can warn us by barking when the creature wants to come up from under the bed.The rest is the usual stuff: toys turning on, snow storm going on outside and other distractions introduced only to make our job much harder. My complaint with the first one was the death animation that included an unnecessary flow of blood on the screen - I am glad to see this has been eliminated.Again, there is a lot of emphasis on having a VR at our disposal. I miss the traditional, non-floating menus as well as a text explaining the various - for instance - graphics settings. And some achievements would also do good. I noticed the disappearance of the free-roaming game mode - the nightmare section returns for the more seasoned players.I liked the sequel. I admit I felt this was the reworked version of the first one, still, it is a great pastime and not just for VR users."

You have your standard creepy room in the middle of the night, that you need to survive in until sunlight. To aid you, all you have is a torch, and of course, the torch has a very limited battery supply that requires frequent charging in order to keep it from running out and then leading to your inevitable and untimely death.At the time of writing this review, I've only played up until the fourth night, but as far as I know, the game does not allow for a movement mechanic beyond mouselook. As such, much like in FNAF 1, you're confined to the boundaries of the one room that you start in and can only look around to survey your surroundings. The Boogeyman will try and creep into your room through the window, door, wardrobe and airvent, and you need to keep shining the flashlight on him in order to stop him from eating your stupid child face off your stupid child head. To make matters worse, there's a creepy AF talking doll in your room that doesn't shut up, and is by far significantly more frightening than the Boogeyman himself.The graphics look very polished and are definitely what I would consider to be visually appealing. I never got round to playing the first BM game myself, but did see others play it on YouTube. The graphical improvements in BM2 over BM1 are evident even to me. The game looks MUCH better in the latest revision and captures the atmosphere of the child's bedroom perfectly.Speaking of atmopshere, the simple yet extremely effective choice of sound effects at tremendously to the atmosphere that the game is trying to generate. It doesn't try too hard and it doesn't bombard you with non-stop loud noises. Rather, it tosses out sneaky, creepy, subtle sounds that confuse you before they frighten you. Audio is a hugely important factor for me when reviewing a game, and I'm glad to say that BM2 holds up in that department.Much to my surprise, this game also supports VR, so I may crack out the Vive over the weekend and try it out. Or not. Not really looking to die any time soon tbh.Overall, a solid little horror game with great graphics, immersive sound and simple gameplay mechanics. If you think you might be interested, give it a try. For the current asking price of $7 something, you've got little to lose.If you'd like to see what the game is like, I have the first 3 nights here -https://youtu.be/o9teFE2LglgCheers :)"

,Recommended,567130,30052602,Posted: 19 February,all,Clyde BlueSnake,"Good horror game!Though I haven't even tried to beat Nightmare yet (though I have a feeling I'll be given up trying to beat it like I did on the Nightmare Night from the first game, but likewise haven't tried yet, anyway), but beat the other 7 nights. The gameplay feel the same from the previous game but new too, like instead getting batteries you recharge your same batteries. Like the new design of the Boogeyman, with the trench coat & all.Though I have one negative thing about it, and that is flashing the light on the Boogeyman. Sometimes I flash the light on him & it won't work, like I will have the radius of the light right on his hand opening the vent & nope not stopping, seem like directly pointing the center of the light on him to stop at times. Anyway, enough of that, anyone reading this try the game yourself to survive from the Boogeyman.For people want to record this game, I don't recommend OBS to record it with. For me only Display Capture on it work alright for it but make the recorded video look slow/laggy. This happen to my first 2 video parts, one of Nights 1 & 2 and the other of Nights 3, 4 & 5. After this I just went and purchase Bandicam. With it my video of Night 6 and the other of Halloween (Halloween video still private on my Youtube channel right now btw) come out good. Though another capture program could work too, but yeah I don't recommend OBS recording this game.My playlist of my playthrough:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWaQqomhiq8ZxVW5DnNrnv8VNg1hg4NZZ"

Pretty sure I have to get a new pair of pants and a new chair!https://youtu.be/gA4OZJhVwCEThe game is simple and very effective... If you want to♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants every fifth minute! So if your into that kind of thing then this game is for you :) I'm usually not easy to scare especially with horror games. This one did the trick though.Pros:- Simple gameplay.- Very effective as a scary game.- The doll is brilliant as an introducer to the various aspects of the game.- One of the best VR games I've tried.- Worth the price.Cons:- When you get the hang of it, the game is quite easy. I would even go as far as to say it's too easy.- Had problems getting the game started in the first place (couldn't find the flashlight). It might just  be me being blind and stupid :)- You need to change your undergarments frequently. If you don't you also have to change your chair!"

A lot of love went into this making it not only a great sequel in the franchise, but also a worthy successor to the already fantastic ""Boogeyman"". The franchise that plays on your childhood fears, and this entry is no exception.  9/10"

76561198072826205,Recommended,567130,29795759,Posted: 8 February,all,austinlockard64,"I absolutely loved this game and HIGHLY reccomend it to annyone interested in the horror genre. The lighting is scary, the story is scary, the monster's scary. I can't wait for any updates to this, just llike the first game. I want to know more about the boogeyman and why he's the boogeyman. Like,*SPOILERS*The first game's boogeyman resembled the Rake in a lot of ways, or like an extraterrestial alien. It was creepily skinney, had large fangs, large fingers, stalked around, etc. This game's boogeyman lookes like a pirate, which isn't a bad thing, it's still terrifiying. I want a book or movie on this series (Not Boogeyman, the already existing movie series)This series has a lot of potential to it and I WANT MORE! I FREAKIN LOVE THIS GAME!Check out my playthrough of it over on my channel. They're kilarious (Hilarious and kill, because I died)https://youtu.be/XFSre9XAnTkhttps://youtu.be/NIHwp8nthzQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOa_LkKR1EYUPDATE: I've discovered some potential glitches that have stopped me a couple times on different nights.Glitch 1: Right click to go to charging station. It's kinda a glitch on fault of the player (in my case plenty of times) but you can click it more than once and you'll be stuck in a limbo of hopping back and forth, unable to ward off the Boogyman.Glitch 2: I don't know what triggers this one, but it's happened only onced to me. Killed by nothing. I scared away the boogeyman on the side of the bed (and watched and heard him go away) then I proceeded to fend off the other Boogeymen, but the bed Boogeyman's timer was still going and i was jumpscared and killed by nothing. The camera panned to the side of the bed and the sounds played, but there was no Boogeyman as I already got rid of him."

76561198072825309,Recommended,567130,31588611,Posted: 6 May,all,drumjenius,"I definitely recommend this game! (I played in VR)Pros:-This game is genuinely terrifying.-The game mechanics are very simple which is a great thing. It keeps you immersed instead of fiddling with learning controls.-The game main menu is pretty neat and atmospheric (it has you navigating the room the game takes place in). I find myself nervous even walking around in it to choose menu options and looking at the details.-The load times are very fast; the transitions betweens nights and starting the game are close to instantaneous. Between nights is just the right amount of time to get your bearings back right before you're thrown into a more difficult and uneasy night.-The nights are not too long and not too short; they are the perfect amount of time to get you right on edge and keep you there for a few minutes.-Very replayable. Where the Boogeyman comes from seems to be quite random so you can't learn any patterns.Cons:-No touch controls yet. Not really a big deal and doesn't subtract from the experience much at all, but it'd be a welcome and convenient addition to the game.-There doesn't seem to be an option to have my desktop screen show the gameplay with both eyes combined. Instead, half of the monitor is one eye view and the other half the other eye view. This takes away from being able to record the experience to share with family/friends, or have them watch while playing.Overall, fantastic horror game with a great price for VR!"

,Recommended,567130,33586342,Posted: 16 July,all,mentatparadigm,"I'm not even a fan of these kinds of games and I'm having a lot of fun with this.First off, this game is a straight up FNaF clone. In fact, it's almost a copy pasta of FNaF4, since you play as a little kid in your bedroom. But the FNaF games never held my interest for very long. The gameplay could be frustrating at times since you could essentially do everything right and still find yourself facing a cheap death. In Boogeyman 2, the gameplay feels much more balanced. When I die, I genuinely feel it's because I messed up somehow. Maybe I took too long charging my flashlight batteries, or maybe I didn't recognize where an audio cue was coming from, but it was probably my fault.The audio cues are a big part of what makes the gameplay here feel more balanced. For each direction the Boogeyman can come at you from, he makes an unique audio cue that tells you where he is. At least, at first. As the game progresses, Mr. Boogeyman gets smarter and learns how to silence his approach. He also learns new directions that he can come at you from. In this way, the difficulty curve feels much more natural than the FNaF games. The first night or two are more or less a breeze to get through and you'll probably only die once or twice as you learn the game's mechanics. By Night 5, you'll feel like a paranoid tweaker hearing rats in the walls, constantly spinning around and afraid to leave any corner unchecked for more than a second or two.I played it both in 2D and in VR and I have to say, the VR is what takes this game to another level. It's an decent game in 2D and worth the asking price but the immersion in VR is incredible. This is my first proper VR game on a real headset so maybe I'm just easily impressed, but everything has just the right amount of depth to it - you can look out the window and the house across the street actually looks like it's across the street and you can see the tree branches reaching out towards the window. The first time you spin you head around and find yourself squinting to see if those are his glowing eyes in the corner or just a trick of the light, you'll know that VR is worth the investment."
