,Recommended,567270,30981849,Posted: 6 April,all,gabzys,HORROR OF THE DEEP is proper horror game. I couldn't finish it because i am not really good at horror games... It is simple walking simulator and you have to find to open doors for next level. Few early level are very easy and not too scary but once to get further it gets worse and worse... and you get to a point where you don't even want to progress because you need to go to new places. I recommend this game for horror lovers and this game is still in development so you can expect even more.PROSHorror.This game earns it's title as horror game. You can feel atmosphere and there are plenty of horrifying messages around you. There are few jumpscares which makes game even more intense and scarier.One of the early game messages that makes you think about idea to move forward (in a good way for horror game)... (no spoiler)http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=899461832Sounds.This is one of the main aspects in horror games and HORROR OF THE DEEP nailed it. It doesn't matter how monsters look but they sound so terrifying that you don't want to see death animation... You can hear them from far and the fact that you need to move towards them makes it hard to progress (in a good way).Gameplay.Gameplay in HORROR OF THE DEEP is simple but it makes everything smoother. Level progression is nice they become harder. Most of levels are kind of labyrinth and they are well done. When there are plenty of monster wandering around it is hard to explore everything.NEUTRALGraphics.Graphics is nice and smooth. There are plenty of details but it could be better.Story.There is no proper story in this game but everything around that is done properly and you aren't missing story. Writings on the ground gives enough tension to compensate lack of story and this is why i put story in Neutral section.CONSCheckpoints.I had to mention current checkpoints in game. If you die there is possibility that you will have to go through walking part without a possibility to die again. It just feel useless sometimes when you clearly know where and how to get to a point where monsters are but you have to do it again and again.Some textures.Textures looks nice but there are other problems like invisible walls. There is arrow on the group and you can't walk through that arrow... In some places you can continuously jump walking to a wall to get to higher grounds or jump over higher ledges.CONCLUSIONI do recommend this game. It is good quality horror game and it's on early access. If developers continue to work on this game it might become really high quality horror game.For more reviews visit :Gabzys the CuratorIf you like it join group and follow me. Thank you.

Split infinitives, redundancy and odd word choices were really distracting from an otherwise amazing game. ""Accept your faith""... wut? Are you sure you don't mean ""Accept your FATE?"" The environments gave me chills; they are expansive and alternated between making me feel claustrophobic and exposed. The ambient effects kept me on my toes and the ambent sounds were creepy. Some of the player effects were awkward, but they were easy to distinguish from ambient sounds. The monsters were not totally inventive, but very scary. The pace of the game was slow at times and generated good jump scares. The puzzles were fairly straightforward.TL;DR It's worth every penny. I can't wait to see the finished product."
,Recommended,567270,29238872,Posted: 13 January,all,Batnip,"I see potential for this game, I really do, and I hope to see it grow. (specs below)Because it's Early Access, bugs and glitches are expected, but with a horror game, it's hard to tell what's a glitch and what's not. There are invisible 'boxes' everywhere, which can be pretty annoying, especially when trying to navigate small corridors. I've seen a few sentences flicker on and off (like ""Pathetic)"". I've also noticed that going further down turns off my Steam Overlay, but that may or may not be a problem on my own part. (I don't know if this is a problem on my part, again, or not, but changing graphics option does not have any visual changes whatsoever for me, in frame-rate or visual property)As for the game, I'd say this is a hit-or-miss, the developer pointed out that it was looking to be more of a rogue-like, which is totally fine, but in exchange for that, I felt it lost some of it's atmpshere. You navigate around as a free-body like in lots of Unity games (but that may have just killed the mood for me, you never know).The first kid/baby you see, if you get too close, will attack you in a rush, but really just sits there, so if you keep your distance, you're good.Sometimes navigating all of the keys can be a chore, especially since the checkpoint is waaaay back, but the developer said that this would be fixed within the next update, which I look forward to. The scenery is pretty cool to look at, gives you a feeling of depth.I would like to see some changes, though.~ There are MANY empty rooms, and the stuff is mostly either empty or the same as the others, I personally don't have too much of a problem with this, but others may (I know, adding stuff may take a little while, it's EA)~ More of a variety of key locations, you basically just have to go back and see if it's in that same room as before, if not, it's in the other one~ Less amount of 'loading' screens. I don't know if this is for both HDDs and SSDs, but my SSD usually takes a wait time of around 3 seconds (further down)~ Readable books? You see lots of books on the stands, it'd be nice to engage in some of them, tell us a story.I run this game at an average of ~60fps, with the occassional stutter to 36 frames (not much, but it happens) (highest settings, but all settings are the same for me)- X4 860k- 8GB DDR3 (1600Mhz) RAM- GTX 950 GDDR5 4GB SSC+"
,Not Recommended,567270,29238074,Posted: 13 January,all,Madea,"So first off, I do realise that this is early access alpha, that also being said I do recognize potential for the game, just needs some tinkering first, so don't take what i'm saying as negative, but more as constructive. Seeing as how as of this moment the basement alpha has been out for at least 4-5 hours there are some things I noticed right off the bat.1. There is no cursor lock, usually isn't too big of a deal for players who play fullscreen, but adding the option to play the game windowed means it's something that has to be implemented, especially when the lantern button is right mouse click, instead of lighting your path the desktop will just light up your face because it tabs the game away.2. There are an insane amount of invisible walls/barriers, just more or less a big bug that can be really annoying, when you have a bunch of prone mobs that distort your vision and will kill you when they touch you once, the scariest part isn't the mobs themselves but hoping to god you remember where the invisible walls are, so when you are running away the walls don't kill you having to restart the entire area.3. The mobs themselves, not scary in the slightest, I think this is one of those cases where quality > quantity. I would've much rather had one distinct enemy with his own mechanics, as opposed to what i saw, essentially the same enemy about 4 times circling in their own little square, which make it ridiculously hard to see, which makes no sense to me anyways, the fact taht you had GIANT golem statues and didn't use them as enemies was a bit of a dissapointment.4.Lack of anything, everywhere. I understand that there is a bunch of space, but having that much space in a horror game lets you use it to further envelop the player in that atmosphere where they're scared to do anything because it might be the last thing they do. A lot of the rooms have the same prop models such as, ""statue"" on belly with arrows in it, skeleton hanging from shackles in wall, podium, podium with book. Having a lot of space gives you the ability to fill it, which I didn't see much, expecially seeing gravestones with ""RIP Unknown"", like really? It would have taken you 3 seconds to pop out a random name from any generator and throw it on there, it's the small details.All in all, like I said, just things I noticed, and I can only hope it's something you read and hopefully fix."
,Recommended,567270,29750678,Posted: 6 February,all,CaysmanOS,"It may be not be the scariest game ever made, but I still had fun in what I played (I've been playing offline as well). The game has issues such as checkpoint issues and fps drops, along with some other problems. However, this game shows a lot promise and I hope to see progress in the future. This review was written during early access, so I hope devs do a good job and see a final product some time in the future."

76561198180855171,Recommended,567270,29736240,Posted: 5 February,all,GamerAreus,"Deffiantly reccomend this game to others. There are some ups and downs about this game, there is no story as to why your where your at, and why, basically no story line to follow. But the graphics are good, the sound effects are amazing, the enemys are well done. So for it not being completely done yet, i can honestly say i cant wait for the completed product!"
76561198236152610,Recommended,567270,29402046,Posted: 21 January,all,TheBloodSwiper,"Its an alright unity game, a little typical (by that, i mean that ive played many similar to its style).Definetly reminded me of Amnesia, but has some originality even so.Its alpha, so ill rate it 2/3 points, aka 6.66/10 for its current state.Do i recommend this game?Yes - if you have the money and is imapient.No - If you are saving money for quality horror games, so i recommend to wait a little before buying it, ountil they announce a massive overhaul.What i realy disliked though, is that there is no saving, and for each ""descend"" you have to experience a loading screen that crashes the game if you try to do something else other than waiting for it to load.I came far, but quited when i accidentaly jumped out of an bridge, and died, and had to restart from the beginning."
,Not Recommended,567270,29553521,Posted: 28 January,all,Seaniemaurice,"Not recommending in its current form in Early Access HOWEVER, it does have some promise and I have feedback and willing to change my recommendation if and when changes are made and the overall game is improved.Whilst the graphics are REALLY well done, the gameplay and overall level design needs some work.For the developer here is some feedback to further improve your game.1) Get rid of the writing... it's an overused motif and incredibly cliche. Nothing about that dictates dread to the player. Saying they are watching would be handy if something was in fact watching me..2) Can you add some form of story into the game? I'm sure if you posted on here looking for voice actors you could find some.3) Key hunts are not fun and there are too many on steam. I get you are trying to go for a rogue like but maaaaaaan. In its current form, running around the same looking rooms avoiding the same creatures looking for keys to progress holds no real enjoyment for the player. May I make a suggestion and switch up the goal and no I don't mean pull levers...Try some traps? If you do make a story, have the gameplay objectives based around that and not in the form of a fetch quest.4) If you are going for the feeling something is watching you... make it seem like something is. Your ambient noise isn'too bad  at the moment but if you add noises  behind the player. (Things dropping, mild footsteps) anything to provoke paranoia this will help with your intention if that even is your intention. A horror game should have you looking behind you at all moments. I didn't find myself doing that in this game.Goodluck, and like I said, I will keep an eye on this project and amend my review and give feedback as you progress. :)"

There are 2 things which i dont like, there is much to find or break or move around, the other is that there is no save and you restart a ways back and when you exit the game you start from the begining which is crazy, since this game is slowly coming together im sure there will be changes and fixes to, over all if i had to rate this game out of 10 i would give it a 8. Developers please get going on this game because it can go far."

OnTheSpectrum,"I do love the overall look and feel of the game, you can definitely tell that it's a work in progress (weird things happening like the perspective being locked to the cursor even though you're in the menu and some problems with collision detection) but other than that, it's very promising! Lots of jump scares and some nice music."

,Recommended,567270,29321304,Posted: 17 January,all,mAks,Nice Game!I really like the dark ambient. Even the contrast between the dark blue and the warm orange of the candlelight causes the feeling of having a nightmare. Being somewhere and try to find a way out of a dark unknown place. I'm excited what is going to happen next.

,Recommended,567270,29253133,Posted: 14 January,all,Gordon Freeloaf,"So after playing for almost 2hrs so far, I think this game shows a lot of promise, it's very beautiful, I had really no issues at all in terms of how well it ran. It creates a nice atmosphere that isn't so scary at the moment, but keep in mind I play a lot of horror games, so your experience with the Alpha 1 of this build may vary from mine. But I can see how this will become something truly special when it's finished. And by then scare my pants off I'm sure! No spoken dialogue at all in the game right now, or maybe ever. But it's interesting just exploring the dungeons and wondering what this game will be when all the pieces are together. 4 out of 5 Skulls for me.My PC specsNvidia GeForce GTX 1070 8gbi7 6700kCorsair vengeance 32GB 2666 RAMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXBuSDkidQ"

The developers are saying they are going to make it VR compatible soon which is very exciting, i will definently get into that. I bet once it is VR compatible it will be very popular."
,Recommended,567270,29295191,Posted: 16 January,all,The Punk Writer,"Hey guys,First off, I want to say, your game does what it intends to do. It is scary. The flickering dark, the domineering architecture, the echoing gloom, they all work very well in putting you on edge.I think that this game has a lot of potential to be a solid horror release in the future.The only thing I felt that currently lets it down (and this may simply be due to by profession as a narrative designer) is that currently, (and I will play some more soon) there doesn't appear to be much in the way of story or lore, and therefore I don't have that quest for knowledge pulling me back to the dungeons when I do die.The game could benefit greatly from the addition of some lore and world building. You have the potential for a brilliant game of the same calibre as Amnesia: The Dark Descent, including its penchant for literary horror like Lovecraft. It's all set up there, and creating a drive in players to keep coming back so they can discover more of the horrifying lore of the place, would certainly play into the lovecraftian theme of forbidden knowledge.Anyway, just my two cents. Will definitely be keeping an eye on this and looking forward to more!"
