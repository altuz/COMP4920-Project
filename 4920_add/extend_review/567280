,Recommended,567280,30110809,Posted: 22 February,all,Reanimate,"Cube Runner is a simplistic and short, yet surprisingly fun game.Positives- Nice artstyle. It's retro and blocky.- Legitimate challenge. It tests your aim and reflexes.- A massive 75 levels to play through- Every achievement can be unlocked in one playthrough; something completionists will love.- Great soundtrack. They also have the name of the song in the pause menu while it's playing, which is a nice touch.- It's listed at a good price of $1.99Negatives- I beat it in an hour, which is pretty short.- Those tall blocks holding the red blocks are super frustrating.- There's barely any replay value.- Controller support is here, but worthless since you have to aim and shoot at blocks with the mouse. This seemed to be a good controller game, but it isn't. Oh well.SummaryCube Runner isn't a bad game at all. I enjoyed its challenge and it's simplistic fun gameplay. It's in a bundle calledJust1337 Purchase Together Bundle, with 11 other games, for $1.50 right now, which I think is worth the purchase. It's especially worth it if you're obsessed with building up a massive Steam library like me."

And even less if you buy it in a bundle.-Steam trading cards.If you like indie games, runners/platformers, and do you want some achievements and another one completed game, Cube Runner is totally worth."

If you like timing games with a cool concept, this game is for you.The good first. The game has a super interesting concept with changing directions and platforms and swapping and pretty much messing with your 3D sense. Unlike many impossible games where the only diretion is right, Cube Runner has upside down right, upside down left, left, cross platform upside down left, etc. You will see what I mean once you enter the game and start getting to later levels. The game provides 75 levels, and they become extremely challenging near the end. However, there is a good checkpoint system to prevent you from ragequitting completely and they are placed very accordingly (and thankfully). The graphics of this game are simple, but they are nice and provide a good appeal to the game. The music is also appropriate and adds a nice touch to the game while you play. Lastly, the game has achievements that so long as you beat the game, you will get all of them.The bad now. Sometimes button presses do not register if at certain points, including mouse clicks. This is not a big deal but it added to the frustration of my gameplay when I kept dying even though I pressed the key. However, sometimes it was probably me just finding excuses, and it happens in other similar games as well. Additionally, sometimes it just gets super confusing at the end where exactly you need to go and what to do. i was able to figure out the endings sometimes just by sheer luck. Lastly, the game slows down a bit when there are fire particles, which gets annoying because the game is so pinpoint timing based.Overall, very good game and adds a nice unique concept to it. This game is short and sweet, never getting old for the amount of levels they have. The best part is that the game is super cheap :)Rating: 8.9/10Recommend Price: Full Price or below"

With a really low file size, I figured I would spend5 minutes playing itjust to see how it was.  That 5 minutes turned into9 1/2 hours.  This game is brutally addicting and will challenge you to the point of wanting to throw your keyboard against the wall..But you keep playing..With every achievement you get, the hunger to get to level 75 becomesmore and moretenacious.  After beating the game and getting every achievement, I'm trulygladthat I decided to give it a shot.  It isdefinitely worth the moneyand I would have happily paid more for it.  If you like:Beautiful looking games with great soundtracksGames that require fast reflexesCasual games that you can play when you're bored.Then you will have a lot of fun playing this game.This game has plenty of replay value, even if it only takes you a few hours to beat.It's only 2 dollars!Buy itYou won't be disappointed!

Minor downer: some levels are way more difficult than others, and require patience.With a level generator and finer controls, this would be a masterpiece!Note that it's not a puzzle game, there is no ""outsmarting"" to be done. You can hardly see what the game wants you to do until you reach a platform, so it's trial and error until you know the level, and time your actions correctly.So yeah, it's a pure platformer – a genre where precision and timing are critical. Most of the time, this is not a problem, but sometimes, the games' difficulty comes from the somewhat clunky controls and camera moves. And with a few double-jumps and enemy blocks, either the game is too picky with timing, or the controls are a bit too unprecise. This means you'll easily beat 30 levels in a row at first try, then hit one that you repeat countless times because of those single frustrating obstacles.Somewhat breaks the ""flow"" you feel when progressing, but there's still fun to be had. I recommend to pick it up in a sale."

,Recommended,567280,31455381,Posted: 29 April,all,Junebug,"Relaxing Achievement SimulatorI got this from a badge coupon; its trailer piqued my interest. The mechanics are very simple—you press R to swap platforms much like Kirby: Planet Robobot and Spacebar to jump. The level of difficulty may get frustrating and sometimes it feels like the controls don't react immediately but these are easily overlooked.Now I just have one question: where can I get the soundtrack? The music ranges from synth-dub to Chillstep. I would even go as far to say that some of these tracks are on the same playing field as what Proximity or xKito promotes. If you're a fan of interesting platformers with great music, give this a try. If anything, pick this up just to have the music playing in the back.8/10"

It has some cool concepts such as switching gravity and changing from background to foreground (From blue to orange basically) However I do think the game is pretty short for the normal price of $1.99 since you do only get 75 levels to play.

I retrived it on the chirstmas purchase together on sale with the rest of their titles for about a dollar, and sold the cards to more or less make the money back.And, to be hoenst, it's not half bad. Not particularly spectacular, but it's nonetheless a very mechanically solid game, if somewhat unpolished. Visually, it's very basic, with not a particularly large ammount going on. Unless you have a solid mouse, whenever you have to shoot something, that will be hellish.However, I feel like, at it's undiscounted price of two dollars, I feel like it's slightly less solid than it's competitors, Geometry Dash and the Impossible Game. While certain the less difficult of the three, it is nonetheless the less visiaully impressive of the three, lacking the myraids of mechanics that Geometry Dash has, but backing it up with a merging of the various mechanics.However, the various mechanics feel slightly boresome or irksome. I feel like, if I had a better mouse, the shooting of blocks would make things much more intresting. The flipping of perspective would look much, much more clearer of where things end should the camera simply snap into the other position, as the snapping motions leaves me slightly motion sick and disoriented.It has about 75 levels, and I have completed about half of them currently.All in all, if you're looking for a simple enough platformer, you'll find this enjoyable enough. I would not have bought it without the bundle, as there are other options only double the cost but with tripple the polish, but should it go on sale, at a dollar on it's own or in a bundle, it's a perfectly fine game."

The puzzle aspect to this game isn't entirely unique, but it is well executed, with decent levels that build on prior techniques with a gradual skill ramp. This would be a fun budget title that could exercise your brain and twitch reflexes and be well worth of a thumbs up. However, it's plagued by some major technical issues. While the game isn't outright broken, it does suffer from some slowdown and jittery frame drops, as well as occasional imprecise and bad control response. These would be quite irritating issues in most games, but since this game requires exacting timing for some jumps and  clicks, it becomes a serious source of frustration. I'd be happy to recommend this game if those issues were cleared up, but as it stands, I would highly recommend you stay away and perhaps play something like 6180 the moon instead for a similar puzzle fix."

76561197961782603,Not Recommended,567280,28891927,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,SpeeDemon,"Graphics & SoundThe visual style reminds me of ""The Impossible Game"", only with 2 planes to jump along and you can reverse direction. Graphics are definitely the best part of the game, which might say something to you. Music selection is fine for this type of game, but there aren't many songs. They repeat quickly.MechanicsGood, except the jumping. When you need to jump repeatedly in a row the cube forces you to slide for a moment, so there are many spots where you will die due to the forced delay. Also, the requirement for a mouse seems out of place and doesn't add much to the game.Level DesignMediocre. For a game with so many directions to travel they could easily behave in a maze like pattern requiring the player to figure out the proper route. Instead you just jump or switch planes as is made obvious to you (or you die) and continue until the end of the game. They could have easily incorporated difficult spots in the level that would not be required, but have achievements waiting for the player. There are none.I can't recommend it by itself, even on sale. However, it may be worth a shot if you get in a bundle and want the achievements or to sell the trading cards. Finally, the advertising seems a bit bogus: ""deep enough to challenge the greatest gamers""? Well, there's 0 story, and the level design is 100% linear, so I'm not sure where the depth comes in."

,Recommended,567280,30403199,Posted: 8 March,all,nujumkey,"This is a rather simple automated platforming game that is all about mechanics with a simple jump, automatic respawns, and some kind of shooter tool (no story). I found the game to be pretty fun. Most autorunning games are randomly generated but this game chose to hand craft all the levels and honestly I think it makes the overall game better. Levels tend to focus on 1-2 mechanics in the game and there are a good variety to play around with. Because your character is constantly moving in one straight line, you have very limited abilities to work with and because you are working with so few tools the developer can make the way you use these tools very specific. The levels are short and very tight, and it made the overall game feel fast and not at all clunky like some of the other platformers out there. The music is also nice, it’s cool to see these smaller games with their own soundtrack (though I noticed the devs reused this one from one of their other games).A few complaints though, none of them are deal-breaking bad but I would like to see them addressed.1. There is a mechanic where you switch between a yellow layer and a blue layer to do platforming in, and the act of switching can throw you off your game as the whole camera and perspective swings around in a half circle. It seems unnecessary, just make the layer not in use transparent, or stop putting obstacles directly after switching points. As a player, I was frustrated dealing with obstacles in this moment of blindness.2. The game lagged in some of the later levels with the fire texture. I don’t know what is up with the fire in this game, maybe it wasn’t optimized because there is only fire in about 5 levels near the end of the game. Either way, it way annoying to deal with.3. Clicking in general felt somewhat imprecise. Even after beating the game I’m not sure why but occasionally when I click on an object, the blast will spawn behind where I wanted it to go.

This game makes you do simple jumps and teleports but somehow makes it impossibly fun. Definitely recommend for people who have little time but want a tonne of enjoyment."

,Recommended,567280,30135213,Posted: 23 February,all,BrokenRedRobot,Nice soundtrack and visuals. Some levels can be frustrating but the music and atmosphere kept my nerves down. Good game.
,Recommended,567280,30206355,Posted: 26 February,all,Wyse,"I really enjoyed this game, and ended up playing through it all in one session.  Great puzzles, with increasing difficulty.  The final few levels, and a few sprinkled in between, were seriously challenging.  Checkpoints are reasonably well-spaced.  A few levels a bit punishing, but eventually doable.  Requires very precise timing.  Beautifully simple visuals, kinda 8-bit and Tron.  Awesome music!  My girlfriend enjoyed listening even without watching.  I played with a Steam Controller, which worked really well (I'm not actually sure how you could reasonably play it without autofire...)."

Its also much shorter despite boasting 75 'levels'. Install, Complete all achiements, Uninstall."
