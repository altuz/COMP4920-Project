Your not going to finish this in 30 mins. I like some of the music in the levels and the moving background and changing colours try to confuse you which add abit of difficulty to it. If your looking for an esay acheivement game that is difficult then I would recommend this

The BGM is also great, and the gameplay is a bit addicting.9/10, a nice casual game for a fair price. I just wish it had more different levels tho, but it’s okay for such a cheap and enjoyable title."
,Recommended,567290,28557544,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,C̮̥̥͋o͚̖͛ẅ͖̭̜̑̏++,"I admit to initially getting Slash It for its achievements, and it was super cheap (either alone or part of the Just1337 Christmas Purchase Together bundle) so I figured why not. However, it quickly proved to be a fun little game that is more than just another count in the game collector badge.There are six modes in the game, which are gradually unlocked with level progression. Classic makes use of the sense of rhythm and reaction time, while the other five will test your touch typing proficiency. As the score increases, the game raises the difficulty to match, forcing the player to react faster.The game is effectively a typing simulator since the player is trained to memorise key locations in order to type faster. It also trains hand-eye coordination because only one key is correct at any time (shown in white; the rest are in black).The soundtrack is also a pleasant surprise (not that I had any expectations in the first place). It may not be to everyone's taste, and I feel it's slightly out of place in a game like this, but I found it to be pretty good. Each mode has its own track, and my games are short enough that looping has not been a problem.The interface is rather basic and the relevant information is presented clearly on the screen. However, the background can be blinding at times which can be annoying in Classic, and may be a concern for some people.Ultimately, most people will get this for the same reasons they got Zup! (and its sequel, Zup! 2): it's cheap, and there are a lot of achievements that are easy to get. If you happen to like the soundtrack, that is just the cherry on top."
,Recommended,567290,28763447,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,ErickaUnlimited,"OverviewSlash It describes itself as a 2D arcade game with widely changing colors, tempos and sounds, however it more aptly falls into the realm of a typing simulator of sorts. The goal of the game is to type the corresponding letters and/or numbers that show up on screen as quickly and accurately as possible. In doing so, you’ll continue racking up points and progressing the seemingly endless level until you either fumble and make too many mistakes, or take too long and time runs out. Your point total is matched against a global leaderboard for those interested in such a feature.The game reminds me a little bit of what brought so much positive attention to minimalist titles like Zup! and Zup! 2, though made by different developers, it still followed a similar model – easy-to-earn achievements that flood your UI simply for playing the game, regardless of how dreadful you really are at it. Regardless of skill, with enough perseverance, you’ll complete it all eventually.When I completed everything in Slash It, the consensus is if you like typing-based games, you’ll find some enjoyment in it. Slash It doesn’t offer anything outside of the genre of typing, aside from switching up the activity with combos, disorienting backgrounds and colors and other visual effects to keep you alert and at the ready for the next wave.Technically, Slash It offers an endless amount of replayability if this is the game for you and overall I enjoyed what it did offer for the price, but it felt like a re-skin of games I’ve seen in the past. Sure, it has an energetic atmosphere, a polished menu, a leveling system and  crisp graphics since it is a current year title, but very little is introduced that would be classed as a refreshing revision to the idea of typing for fun outside a plethora of cosmetic changes.You could look at older titles or even their revamped counterparts like “Mario Teaches Typing” or flash games like “Ninja Cat & Zombie Dinosaurs”. They sound and might even look vastly different on paper and visually they do, but when you look at the gameplay mechanics, you’re still trying to improve your typing and reactionary abilities to garner higher and higher scores.In the end, what you need to take away from all of this is that Slash It suffers from careless Steam reviews and hype over easy achievements; the game produces an interesting take on the act of typing, offering a modern way to create both a space for learning and fun, depending on what you purchased it for, but be an informed consumer and know that Slash It is a very niche game for a very niche audience outside of those looking to bolster their achievements and add another perfect game completion under their belts.ProsSimplistic and responsive UI and controls.Visually appealingSome decent replayability and leaderboard options for those interested.ConsLacks substantial content aside from improving your own high score.The game offers little incentive to continue once all the achievements are earned.Overall, Slash It isn’t a bad game, as it promotes and delivers what it intended. However, I could feel my interest waning the more I progressed into the game. The initial feeling of excitement over something new quickly faded into grinding out the last few achievements so I should shelve it as a finished game and let it collect dust on my virtual bookshelf. Some of you will enjoy the title more than me, while some of you will find it lacking substance and wave it off. Ultimately, Slash It does what it does well and for that alone I give it a positive review, despite my own personal lack of interest in it."

,Recommended,567290,28647286,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,berzha101,"Slash It is a typing/timing game where the goal is the not fall behind or mess up. The game seems simple enough, and it is quite simple. However, there are elements that make it super fun for the short amount of time that I played it for.To begin with the good, the game is cheap. When I mean cheap, I mean super cheap. Anybody can pick this game up, and enjoy it. The game also comes with steam trading cards so thats another reason why you should get it. That aside, the game is actually fun. There are 6 different modes to play on, with each mode being a little harder/different from the previous ones. The game has a very good visually appealing design and awesome electronic soundtrack that plays in the background. Best of all, this game has 302 Steam Achievements, and you can get them all in the matter of around 1 hour or so just by playing the game. The Steam Achievements give you an additional reason why to continue to play the game, even if at the end you are just trying to grind a little bit for that last letter or number. The game progression is smooth and overall the game is very fun.The only thing that I can say that the game lacks in is further replayability and lengthened game time. The game gets pretty repetitive, because it essentially is a typing/timing game and may get boring upon further length play. However, you will be satisfied playing the game before the last Steam Trading Card drops.Overall great game and a must buy for a short burst of fun and easy Steam Achievements!Rating: 8.4/10Recommend Price: Full price or less"

76561198047672025,Recommended,567290,28466076,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,Conker,"Another one of those ""achievement"" games, has a few different game modes you need to play to get all of them. The classic mode i liked the best, you can kinda zone out while playing it when you get into the rhythm of pressing the spacebar in time with the shapes lining up with each other.The other modes are typing games where you need to type numbers or letters in the sequence they are shown. I found these modes to be tedious and annoying and outstayed their welcome far too soon. I was using my wireless slim keyboard which has flat keys which makes it a lot harder to press the right keys while looking away from the keyboard. couldn't be f*cked connecting my fat wired microsoft keyboard to make it easier, so bear that in mind, i had no fun playing those modes.The last mode combines the letters and numbers modes so it doubles the annoyance. I will say, even if you're rubbish at typing you can still eventually get all the achievements because it keeps your progress every time you restart so someone who is good can complete one mode in say 10 attempts, if you're not good it might take you 50 attempts but the achievements would still eventually drop for you.It kinda worries me cos Zup didn't try that hard to begin with, but that was way more enjoyable than this. But you know, 302 easy achievements so..."

But it offers so much more than that!The 6 game modes are fun and increasingly challenging. Slash It pretty much teaching you the location of every letter or number on your Keyboard since you have absolutely no time to check where they are. As longer you survive in mode the more and more letters or numbers (or both) are on the screen that needs to be pressed in the right order. On top of that, the game has a great soundtrack that is always matching the action on the screen.If you are into reaction, rhythm type games you will have a great time with “Slash it”And if you are an Achievement farmer that wants some easy Achievements, you will also find your happiness with this game!"

Slash It's only true purpose is the acquisition of achievements.The first game mode of Slash It actually does have quite a challenging purpose; to exactly match two geometric shapes as one of them changes size. Because each subsequent shape often comes quite rapidly, it can be pretty difficult. But that in itself isn't a very compelling game. So as levels are gained, modes can be opened involving typing numbers as they appear on the screen, Then letters. Friends, you pretty much have a grasp on the entire comcept of this game. If you see a challenge at all, let me warn you, if you can devise a system to automatically type every letter or number (depending on mode) you don't even have to be in the room. There is no penelty for wrong answers.Did I forget to mention Slash It has (in the very words of the Store Page game description) ""300+ easy achievements."" After all, what can be more challenging or fun than an achievement for pressing the letter ""N"" thirty times?Sorry, but even at this low price I can't consider this a game."

,Recommended,567290,30045624,Posted: 19 February,all,GeoLuz 🎮💯👊🤙,"Slash It is a game made up of 6 modes of play. The modes of play challenge you to type letters or numbers, or both, in the order presented to you on the screen. The game begins with a Classic mode, which requires you to match shapes in a timely manner. This is quite challenging at the beginning, but my reflexes improved gradually as I became accustomed to the shapes appearing in large and small sizes. In addition, the colors are constantly changing regardless of the mode you play.After reaching level 5 in Classic mode you can begin to unlock Numbers mode, Alphabet mode, Twisted Numbers mode, and Twisted Alphabet Mode and Insane Mode. The electronic music playing in the background adds to the entertaining and challenging gameplay. I think that Slash It can help improve your typing skills after reaching the minimum level required to unlock other modes. There are Steam leaderboards showing high scores if you are interested in seriously improving your typing skills and become part of the top 10.Other rewards offered by this game include 300+ Steam achievements and Steam trading cards. The achievements are easy to attain if you continue to practice getting the letters and numbers in the correct order presented to you.Just1337, the developer behind Asteroid Bounty Hunter and other indie games, did a good job making a game that challenges your typing reflexes. They also did a good job with the entertaining aspect of the game by changing colors quickly and implementing electronic music. Therefore, the game is not boring at all. I recommend this game to those who want to be entertained with matching shapes, typing letters, and typing numbers, in a never ending challenging to increase your score. If you are an achievement hunter you would have more reason to buy Slash It.My Score: 8/10"

,Recommended,567290,34086997,Posted: 7 August,all,Itohiro,"Alphabet and number modes are a good way to enhance your typing habilities (there is no need to rotate the buttons, however). Classic mode is confusing due to the background and particles. Twisted and insane modes aren't fun."
,Recommended,567290,34241397,Posted: 14 August,all,ToiletROCK,"If you have played Spin Rush before, this game is somewhat similar to that. Graphics aren't fancy but it isn't bad either; it's plain simple and fits the overall game. The music is catchy and fitting; the game cycles a few tracks of its own. It seems to lean towards the techno/rave kind, so if you don't like that sort of upbeat genre, you probably might find the music obnoxious. Gameplay is pretty simple to catch on. Like SR, there will be many color switches and sudden flashing to distract you and break your focus. A minor inconvenience but it breaks the monotony a bit. Although there are many modes to choose from, it can be repetitive once you played it for a while. If anything, the numbers and alphabets mode will train your reflexes and memory of where the keyboard buttons are without looking at the keys. There are many achievements to hunt as well. Although, it may appear to be spammy, it does take quite a long time to get them all and you'd have to actively play the game properly, and not leave it to idle or perform mundane tasks like die 500 times to get 100%. Personally, this game is more suited to be played in short bursts when you're feeling bored and want to kill some time."
