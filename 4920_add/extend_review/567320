It is of course really hard, and especially when you have a budget pc, it can be really hard to finish some levels in a short time. That's probably also the reason why they added the practice world (world 00). I really like the game and the fast pace of it, and I'm very excited for the official release."

Considering this game is in early access and is only 2 months old, it's absolutely brilliant. I cannot wait for new content. Believe me, it may be some random indie game but oh my lord! It's worth your money. Definitely recommend considering the price. 9/10 (-1 for minor annoying bugs such as getting caught on walls and hitboxes being a tid bit too big but they're easy to fix.)Edit,you will encounter a few crashes here and therebut not as often as some games. Also, if it says it's stopped responding just click wait till the program responds and it'll load up practically instantly. :)"

It's early access, but it has great platforming and gameplay, along with support across all OSes and relatively low PC requirements. But there is one thing I think should be added to the game:Splitscreen/Couch Multiplayer. Useful for parties and stuff. Preferably, splitscreen games could be online games and have other players join.I haven't seen anyone alse mention that, but I think it would be a great addition to the game. But obviously the main game and its levels should be worked on first."

I cannot tell you how many games I have seenmake it to steam being EXTREMELY half-baked. This game, however, is definitely not on of those games. This game has very great potential and from the levels that have been published so far, it is very fun.INCLUDES:Singleplayer (For campaign)Multiplayer (Get the best time)Also, there is a discord link.You can get free games on it. I am just gonna point that out :3So, overall, I would say this is a pretty good first person parkour game on its way to becoming a great one."
,Not Recommended,567320,33183684,Posted: 3 July,all,ToRRent,"Searching for good fpp platformer on steam is hard. I bought V3, and already thinking about refund.The game is horribly optimised, even with 120 fps on a counter, the game is incredible stuttery which brings to me awful experience. The movement is bunny hoppy/strafe'y. Of course it's not like in quake engines, but still a good attempt. Based onspeedrun.comrecords, it looks like the game is insanely broken and times are optimised so it's almost impossible to reach top in the leaderboards."

The audio is crazy loud when you first launch it, took me 10 mins to get out of the settings (which i eventually just restarted the game), and rocket jumping seems quite difficult when you first try it but with time, you can get better.When you are in low setting like me, i could barely see the text in the settings, the background could be changed, and brightness could be changed as well."

,Recommended,567320,30278067,Posted: 2 March,all,Prollgurke,"*Really fun running and jumping game*So this game is about jumping, running and occasional rocket jumping. You can load up different maps and try to get the best time possible. This can also be done in multiplayers. This kinda reminds me of Trackmania, just without the cars.At first, it takes some time to get used to the engine. In fact, it does feel kinda clunky in the beginning. But once you get the hang of it the gameplay will feel pretty smooth and rewarding which is a ton of fun.You basically sprint most of the time while you bunnyhop from obstacle to obstacle. Bunnyhopping works by repressing jump mid-air and holding it (like in Reflex). Strafing works by just moving the mouse. Though, you can strafe extremely tight curves while keeping your speed which allows for some crazy movement (unlike in source engine where too tight curves cancel your air-strafe). Rocketjumping works like default arena shooters, but you can't use it to gain speed at the moment. Also, there's wall-jumping. All this makes speeding through the maps pretty fun already.The game offers great replayability value. First, it's about finishing a map. After that, it's about finding new skips and shorter routes and trying to finish those.Since it's early access and the Steam release was just yesterday, you can except a few bugs, like a clunky game-menu or keybindings not saving after a game restart (I remember even Overwatch having this same problem though lol). Though, there aren't any gameplay impairing bugs at the moment. You can also take a look at the public roadmap or the discord server to see when these bugs are getting fixed!So, if you like jumping/bunnyhopping mods/maps from other games you'll probably like this game too."

,Recommended,567320,32850313,Posted: 27 June,all,zonzon le raton,"Really nice technical platformer.Expect to rocket jump and circle jump a lot. (you need to know a little about advanced FPS jump techniques)Controls are tight as tight can be, air control is a literal 100%.Gameplay is rewarding and is bound to your skill."
,Not Recommended,567320,30843118,Posted: 30 March,all,Nixon,I think this game has a lot of potential. But at this stage of development it just feels.. off. The physics don't feel right at all. I intend to revisit it later.
,Recommended,567320,30495490,Posted: 13 March,all,Jacket,"This game is like a middle ground between bunny hopping and mirror's edge: It's slightly fast-paced and easy once you know what you're doingeven tho I enjoyed the game, I got a platinum medal on all levels that have been added to this point within an easy 1,1 hours. I can only really recommend this game once the level editor releases OR if the single player campaign ends up getting alot of levels"

,Recommended,567320,30345909,Posted: 5 March,all,Duck,"Hello thereI was looking for a new parcour game to do speedruns. Well this is it. I have 2.3h in game right now and I love the game ! Of course their are some things that need to be fixed. And if you think the platinum times are to hard, they are not. Just re-try and find other shortcuts. I can see this game become big in the speedrunning community. Why? Because I saw that they were adding a speedrun mode in.Worth the money !"
,Not Recommended,567320,30289073,Posted: 2 March,all,Dobson LuggNut,"Let me preface this by saying that yes, I do only have less than 10 minutes in the game. Now onto the problems that I had in said first 10 minutes.1st. In-Game sounds and Music volume did not sync up for me. I could turn down the music volume but the game sounds would still be unbarebly loud. Obviously thats isn't supposed to happen.2nd. None of the settings in which I could change actually did something. My FOV never changed when either increasing it or decreasing it. My sensitivity never changed when either increasing it or decreasing it. The very little graphics options available never had any effect on playability. I couldn't even change my keybindings. Nothing would save after being changed. Even after relaunching the game and reinstalling.3rd. This game cost $10(off-sale). Now i understand that this game is in Early access, I do however believe that the problems that I was having should not be happeneing even in the current game state. I have requested a refund and will be getting my money back.All that being said, I do very much enjoy these types of games(FPS 3D-Platformers) so much that I will definitely come back to this game once it has been fully released and plays like a dream. The best thing I can do now is to warn people about the current problems the game is having. I wish the best of luck to 2xMilk and his dev team and I truly hope that they can make this game as good as it looks."
,Not Recommended,567320,30783824,Posted: 27 March,all,Quirken,"Pro:-gorgeous graphicsAs it currently stands, the jump physics are driving me crazy. It's early access, so maybe that will change.I found out about this game because I was playing Seum, which is more or less the same idea, except Seum has Super Meat Boy style traps. I have 600+ deaths on Seum in 2 hours of play. It's pretty difficult (though probably easier than SMB to be fair). Both games have you jumping platform to platform at fairly high speeds and have a variety of power ups.So why do I not like VThree?Simple: jump distance. It just doesn't feel right in VThree. In Seum, I can jump over numerous platforms, having to aim and lob grenades while I do it. I miss platforms all the time and die, but more often than not, I make individual jumps, just not a string of 12 when that happens.In VThree, by the second TUTORIAL level, I was already frustrated enough with the jumping that I exited the game.You can never just hit forward and jump at the right time, because the platforms aren't spaced relative to your jump distances. The next platform seems to be some awkward distance that's not even close.So if you're imagining rapid forward movement where you hold the W key and just hit space at the right time... this game isn't it. You have to not only jump at the right time, but also finesse exactly how far forward you're going. It's fiddly and it's frustrating. I'm failing jumps not because the jump itself looks difficult or because you're moving quickly and need to string a bunch of jumps together. Even basic jumps in this game are infuriating to me.I'm all for difficult games, but something is wrong if even the tutorial is frustratingly difficult.Now, it's early access, and one of the things they're going to change between now and release is ""Finalized Controls."" If they tweak the player's move speed / jump distance a little, with the same levels, I think I'd really like this game. But for now, having to nudge backwards while mid-air (or frequently let go of forward in an attempt to slow down so that you don't vastly overshoot the next platform) is a common sort of thing, and it's just not fun for me because of that. Almost all of these sorts of games have you more or less keep a constant move speed and relatively consistent jump distances."

76561198338563047,Recommended,567320,30314599,Posted: 4 March,all,{flopsid3tactics}-toto,"The game itself has a load of potential, but the alfa does obviously have some bugs (the gravity jump not doing anything etc), but theone thing that i dont like is the time limitations for unlocking new levels. I ike the idea of trophies, but i feel like they should come after unlocking all the levels, or at least become a prioraty then. The way that these time limits work, is that, at first, you have to use shortcuts, meaning that sections of maps are rendered useless. All that aside, really fun game, a bit like cluster truck"

I hit save, and it crashes, and that's it. Also, why is it so ♥♥♥♥ING LOUD?!?!? Seriosuly though, this does not work AT ALL. All 6 minutes of this game have just been trying and trying to get the game to go anywhere. This might be because I'm on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) but still, don't make it available for Linux users and CHARGE US REAL MONEY when it won't start. I feel scammed and cheated, there is no way in any ring of hell that I would reccomend this to anyone for any reason. There are cheaper ways to level your profile and there are better ways of getting sale badges. This will be the first game on Steam I ever return, and I think it's fair to say that there's a good reason for doing it."

It's a slow parkour game that gives you boring abilities that aren't creative.GraphicsJust basic ones. No real effort in these graphics. They are very easy to make and don't show any effort nor passion.Wondering how the gameplay is? Here's a trailer for it. Let's see how fast paced the action isHere!(This isn't a official one, but captivates the experience well.)MusicI can't find it good. Just repetitive sound that drills right into your head. Sound effects CANNOT be disabled making a rather infuriating grunting noise ruin any other sound there is. No passion into it.FeaturesAbilitiesMovingJumpingBeing Bored!Speed running. That won't save this game. I doubt it will be anything but a stupid timer.Level editor. Will be just as bad as NMS, except a googolplex worse.MultiplayerI expect terror. A parkour game should not have multiplayer especially for how small the maps and platforms are on here. Mirrors edge is fine for multi. This game is not. It's extremely unrepeatable in terms of playing again. I believe that the vast majority who finish this game will not play again. It is a cash grabThese devs have no passion. End of.Developer is not capable of handling criticism and just insults and uses the family card to escape. How cowardly"
