,Recommended,567370,29652555,Posted: 2 February,all,BITs19_,"Saw this on Watch + Play as a pallete cleanser, bought it during the stream.There is so much depth here in how greedy you choose to be, and in turn, how much you decide to spend on weapons. The soundtrack is great, F.R.A.N.D is shaped like a friend, the time from death to restart is nice and short, and the difficulty ramping as you manage to survive in the crater for longer simply adds more gameplay possibility, as you adjust to new threats.TL;DR For four bucks CAD? Get the game."

,Recommended,567370,29732415,Posted: 5 February,all,noname,"This is an amazing little arena shooter.So, you're a person with a robot in a cursed crater in space. Possibly on the moon? The gravity is low, so the controls take some getting used to. I don't think they're bad, they just make your character feel like you have momentum.Your robot is mining gold from the crater for you, and your job is to get the gold back to your base, while defending yourself from an onslaught of skeltins, skells and worse. There's a really clever greed mechanic that gives you more gold for waiting longer to deposit in in the bank, with the obvious penalty of losing everything you're carrying if you die. It's absolutely gotten me several times, but it's just so tempting ...Anyway, it's difficult, but with the persistent upgrade system, you feel like you're actually progressing. I don't know what the endgame is, the longest I've been able to live is just over 3 minutes. I know I'm going to have fun finding out.So, other things.This game feels like it's tuned to make you grin, even while it's kicking your teeth down your throat. From the little informational posters in your base//office to the voxel-cute enemies  (except the bone balls. those things are freaky) the whole thing feels like it's got an great sense of humor.The sound design is solid, and the music is very good. (OST DLC PLS?) I think it might get repetitive at some point, but I haven't lived long enough for that yet.This game is great, the price is insane. If you like this kind of game just buy it. Don't wait for a sale, buy it. It's $4. You can afford that. Buy it."

Absolutely brilliant and painfully addictive. Simple idea, simple mechanics, works so well. I cannot commend the devs enough for this. If you have a couple of bucks to throw somewhere, I strongly suggest you throw them at this game!"

It's a physics based game, and as such you accelerate and decelerate, but they don't feel slippy to me. Like all games, it took a few runs to get a feel for it, but honestly within 5-10 minutes it felt pretty natural.The music is top-notch, and goes through a really nice loop. A lot of times I find myself getting irritated with songs in games where you continually start over repeatedly, but so far I haven't gotten sick of it. I also really enjoy the speed at which the difficulty ramps up. It takes a minute or two to really get going, which feels like just the right amount of time to warm up and get into the flow. The art style is also super cute! It manages to be both dark and super colorful at the same time, and I love the design of the ""spooky"" skeletons.The only complaint I really have is that there's a pretty limited selection of weapons to choose from, though it seems pretty obvious that this is meant to be just a small, quick, fun little game, and as such isn't overflowing with content like that. For the price, I feel like it's totally worth it, especially if you like the ""challenging, insta-death"" genre."

,Recommended,567370,29810406,Posted: 9 February,all,CleverCrumbish,"Like many reviewers here, I saw this game first as a palate cleanser on LoadingReadyRun's Watch and Play, and bought the game during the stream. I have to say that it is well worth the £2.79, and indeed that I'd consider paying up to £6 for the provided experience. Atomic 79 is a fantastic Devil Daggers-esque arena runner where you follow your trusty mining robot (adorably designated F.R.A.N.D) around a dark crater to collect the gold it digs up, all the while avoiding and shooting the nefarious ""Skeltins"" that one-hit kill you if they reach your position.Though seemingly simplistic, the game has a lot of well-designed hidden depth that enriches the experience. Gold pickups' point value is incremented based on how much gold you are already carrying without depositing it, meaning the more gold you're willing to risk, the more you get. Strong, fast enemies spawn if the regular enemy spawn limit is reached, punishing the player for playing defensively and merely avoiding the Skeltins. The player's secondary weapon (a grenade) recharges its use based on enemies killed since it was last used, rewarding aggressive play again. All the weapons (including the grenade) can be upgraded with gold collected, and helpful posters around the starting area appear as features are encountered, explaining how to deal with them.Also of note is the fantastic soundtrack by Aeronaut, which is consistently entertaining. Overall, Atomic 79 is a great game for either long or short play: a run generally takes under 5 minutes, though I find myself chaining runs together for over an hour at a time. The price is almost trivial, and great value for the received content, and I recommend everybody with an interest in roguelites, arena runners, voxel art, cute robots, neat electronic tunes, cool and well thought-out game mechanics, moon craters, and feelings of horror and impending doom as the grenade one threw illuminates the hordes of enemies ready to replace those caught in its blast check this game out."

Buy this game.Do you have the price of a starbucks small coffee burning a hole in your steam wallet? Do it.If you have any love for FPS, you can and should give this a try. There's very little to lose in buying it and you're supporting what I feel is a very promising new developer who had a great iteration on a classic arena/horde shooter on their hands, and then took those mechanics and pumped every single crevice they could find with so much charm that the end result came out watertight and bulletproof.Like many others I caught this on the VOD of Watch+Play, and I was thrilled to see just how well everything fit together. And so I want to address the next part of this to the Developer personally: You've done incredible work in the Unity personal engine, and while it suffers a tiny bit from being made in that engine, you made what minor annoyances there were part of the game's aesthetic. Please continue to develop for this game, as there currently is a definite point where a person playing it will run out of things to buy and at that point their interest may drop off. For its price, it is absolutely a finished product, but it feels like the enjoyability of the later stages of play time could be increased.And even if you don't, please continue making games. I'll have my eye pinned on any new projects on the horizon coming from this studio, and others would be fools not to do the same."

The music is great, the aesthetic is ridiculous, the challenge is demanding and I can see myself already getting better, the upgrading is enjoyable, and overall I'm just going to blow the hell out of the freaky skull ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in this crater or die trying (one milliion times).I honestly can't recommend this enough."

Uses the basic WASD keyboard scheme for movement, which I personally prefer. Tutorial and game info is incorporated in a clever way as well."
,Recommended,567370,29242520,Posted: 14 January,all,A Big Unshaved Bear,"Its a fun and interesting take on shooters with a different kind of ""Pixel"" style. I'm not a huge fan of the music like everyone else is, but that's just me and my taste in music. It does not get repetative or annoying as you play. What is annoying to me is just how frequently the skeletons spawn. And in tandem with that I'd say the collison with the dozens of fallen skeletons can be deadly if you don't notice them. Although I don't think that's a bad thing since who wouldn't be stumbling trying to walk on hundreds of various bones?I feel like the game will be much easier and more exciting the more you progress and gain more weapons. You DEFINITELY have to keep moving or die in seconds since the mobs will spawn where everywhere you can't see.The game is not without its quirks and bumps, but I think if the developers work little bits on the game it can be something great."
,Recommended,567370,29239757,Posted: 13 January,all,Celirae,This game is so great! I spent my night playing it. I have read some of the reviews complaining about the movement. It is not hard to get used it and it makes since since the game is in space. It is difficult and I usually hate rage inducing games. This one makes me want to not stop playing til I get farther! I definitely think you should check it out!

I don't know the terminology. Whatever. It's the best game in the last 10 months. However it doesn't have 300 hours worth of potential play like some in the genre. I hope there's more coming down the pipe from this developer, either updates for this game, or more games.This is fun. Buy it."
