,Recommended,567580,30362055,Posted: 6 March,all,TheRealCelticBatman,"This is a simple concept bullet hell game.  I like it.  It does have a quirk, where you sometimes cannot get to the level selection screen, but it is minor in comparison to how fun the game is.  It isn't hard, even on the highest levels, if you upgrade your weapons and ship, but it still requires some hand-eye coordination.7.5 / 10 in a bundle.   5/10 at full retail."
,Not Recommended,567580,30489042,Posted: 13 March,all,SupremeS,"Look - I knew what kind of monster Duke of Alpha Centauri would be before I even booted it up. I knew it wasn’t aiming to give me the time of my life – that it was using other means and devices to hopefully scavenge some money out of those unfortunate enough to be drawn into its web. Yet, like the car wreck you drive past on your way to work, it turned out it was just too hard to look away from and ignore. And, with a coupon providing such a massive discount on the title in my possession, I couldn’t help but stop and look closer at how much of a garbage fire this really is.The observant among you may have noticed I mentioned that “other means and devices” are at work here, and are wondering what the heck that means. The answer to that is quite simple – Duke of Alpha Centauri is using and abusing the Steam trading card and achievement systems, in a way that those desperate to get as many of both will be drawn to this like moths to a flame. This became rapidly apparent when, after 30 seconds of play that involved merely holding down the fire buttons and not moving at all, I had unlocked 17 achievements. Given another 5 minutes, I had unlocked 50 more. In just under 2 hours you can have all 128 in your possession, healthily padding out your total achievements, while also giving you cards you can shill off to reimburse some of the money you paid for the privilege. In a sense, it’s equal parts incredibly shady and remarkably clever – capitalise on people’s desires to obtain both, and the awful game you’re releasing with them hardly even matters in the end.Because, as you’ve probably guessed, this game is pretty awful. It all starts when you notice the word “controls” is spelt wrong in the option menu, and then it only goes downhill from there. The funny thing is it actually all looks ok – while none of it is exactly mind-blowing, the backgrounds and ships are nice and vivid, and there’s a healthy dose of creative commons music that I will admit to tapping my toe to once or twice. The problem, by miles, comes from the fact that there is literally no challenge of any sort to be found here.This is no exaggeration – I literally mean there is no challenge here. You can randomly float round the screen mashing your keyboard to activate power-ups, and never come across anything that even closely resembles a threat. Everything works in your favour, and not always in intended ways – for instance, your main weapons have power levels that are meant to drain, but when they hit zero there’s absolutely no negative effect. Additionally, if by some quirk of fate you do die in a level, you’ve got two extra ships anyway – and, weirdly, it seems more beneficial to commit suicide regardless. This will then grant you much more XP to use on the game's crude levelling system when compared to, you know, actually doing well and surviving. It's surreal.It reached the point about 20 minutes in where everything was so trivially simple I was staring at my phone while casually wiggling the mouse about, and I was still doing just fine. There’s no satisfaction to be had, nothing to hold the attention – just endless droves of ships to mindlessly plough through. Hilariously, there’s a tip on the loading screen that states what to do “If you feel vulnerable”, which might as well just be removed from the game completely – because it’s never going to happen.So yeah, don’t buy this game. Even if you’re a massive sucker for trading cards and cheevos, this sort of attempt to capitalise on them really shouldn’t be encouraged. I suppose in a sense it’s hypocritical of me to say that after I’ve benefitted from both – but hey, at least it wasn’t you who sat there bored out of their mind for two hours finding that out."
,Not Recommended,567580,32055139,Posted: 29 May,all,Raptor85,"Short Version: It's not terrible, but buy it when it's on sale.Long Version:Graphics: Ok, not great, the levels and ships really aren't much to look at, the particle effects are simplistic, like you'd see in a directx or opengl demo in 2005. The only real visual difference between levels is the planet in the background.6/10 - above averageSound:  Sound effects aren't bad, not jarring, not much here.7/10 - goodMusic:  Doesn't fit the game at all, sounds like bought tracks, plus the game just randomly shuffles them and plays one during whatever level you're in.3/10 - poorControls:  Has keyboard and  controller binding, so that's a plus, though my dualshock 4 which works fine in other games just constantly reads as tilting the stick up no matter what i set, so controller had to be unplugged to play. The game is clearly hardcoded to check the wrong axis for this controller and there seems to be no way to set as the ingame menus do not function with the controller plugged in.  Also has mouse support which worked fine.  Keyboard controls worked fine but there was a strange input delay, ship didn't feel 100% responsive.3/10 - extremely buggy (7/10 if controller bug was fixed)Level Design:  There really isn't any, all the levels are pretty much the same empty space with asteroids, each level just throws slightly more at you, but there doesn't seem to be any real sense of progression or difference between levels besides the number.2/10 - badGameplay:  Pretty boring and easy, even on the hardest modes. You more or less see the exact same ships all game with a few tiny variations, just more of them, and without any real level design to back it up it gets old really fast.  There's multiple fire keys and keys to lock on to targets for your special weapons but there's no point, you really just end up using auto-target and holding all the keys down at all times as theres no point in NOT firing.  it takes a LOT of damage to kill you as well so dying is actually pretty hard to do, after i cleared the game i ended up going to the level 20 boss and suiciding on it 9 times to get the last achievement as i'd only died once in the entire playthrough, and that was because i was watching a youtube video and ran into an asteroid.  Endless mode can literally be ""beaten"" by going on forever by just staying in the middle left and holding the fire button.  It is however functional, and the level-up mechanic would be nice if there was more to the game.4/10 - poorLength:  I cleared the entire game with all achievements including surviving endless mode in under two hours, and that included going idle to chat on twitch and do other things. Actual playtime to beat the game is probably less than a hour, this is VERY short, even by schmup standards.(at the $0.50 i paid, whatever, but at full price i wouldn't say this short of a game is worth it)Overall opinion: 3.5/10This is really the kind of game you'd expect from a weekend game dev competition or on a flash website, it's very small and there's not really a lot to it. The core mechanics actually work though, and if the developer had put some more work into it, maybe giving it a story mode with actual levels and variety it could have been a very fun game, but as is it just gets really boring and repetitive after the first few minutes."

The achievements are easy to get.  The game offers a couple hours of game play with decent controls and pretty sound effects.The game isn't perfect.  Early on the loading screens are longer than the levels.  The asteroids are much weaker graphically than everything else on the screen so they distract.  The hit box on your ship is slightly bigger than your ship, so you will get hit by stray fire when you are not expecting.However, the level design is well done.  You earn experience and upgrades for your ship, and I was able to customize my playstyle as I got a sense for how the game progressed.  You get a good feeling of power with all of the bells and whistles they throw on your ship, and yet control is pretty easy.Overall I think it is worth it if you are into this genre, especially for the price."

You can beat the game and get all 128 achievments complete in about 4hrs taking my time at it. I got it on sale for like 89 cent, so i got my money's worth out of it.Recommended?

Playing for the first time on medium I was able to finish the game without dying once, and get 100% achievements, in 2 and a half hours, and that includes the half hour I left the game on pause to make a sandwich.

The graphics are great but the gameplay is awfully boring.  I have found that the key to winning is to spend 2 levels powering up your missles (takes 10 minutes).  After that you can sit in the middle of the screen, spamming your heat seakers and never have to move.But the game is cheap, you say?  Well, $1.79 for a game that I didn't enjoy and will never play is $1.79 I could have put towards another game.  For my review I played for just under 2 hours, leveled up to lvl 60+, got 106/128 achievements because I felt I had to in order to give a proper review, not because the game was fun.

,Recommended,567580,34101255,Posted: 8 August,all,ToiletROCK,"A Shoot-Em-Up space shooter. You play as a lone fighter working your way through hordes of enemy fighters and bosses. The game is relatively simple to grasp. Since this isn't the Japanese-styled bullet hell shooter or arcade variants, your ship can take quite a lot of hits before exploding. The controls are smooth; not clunky and respond quickly to button-pushes. The graphics are decent, although at times, the enemies look like toys to me. The music is good; not annoying and adds flavour to your playthrough. Presence of upgrades to further improve your ship adds further zest to the game and the myriad of weapons allows you room to pick and choose what you want to decimate your enemies with. Achievements are relatively easy to obtain 100%; simply playing the campaign itself will net you a ton of them. The only flaw I can see in this game is the lack of challenge and its repetitiveness. Perhaps it's by the developer's goal to let the players have lots of fun killing many things at once that the difficulty of the game is ramped down so low. Also, the game does get very repetitive after an hour or two, so I wouldn't recommend playing this long-haul. Not a bad pick for its price. Might come back to finish it later some time."

It's pretty short but does have a fair amount of boss fights for what it is. Levels are nice and difficulty increases fairly. Endless on the other hand is pretty boring. My only tip for gameplay is to rotate using missles and lasers one after the other while you're waiting for the other to reload.The graphics are alight. I wouldn't be suprised if they had a version for smartphones. I did have the gakeme crash on me once but other than that I have no complaints.Achivements are also really easy. Good game all around.

That in and of itself doesn't make this a bad game, in fact, this game is pretty damn solid. It's got upgradable systems, lots of enemies, multiple weapons, flashy graphics, responsive controls, and a smooth framerate. The only thing it is really missing is a challenge. I played the whole game on the hardest difficulty and only had trouble on the second to last level (not counting the endless level). And I'm no bullet hell master at all, in fact I'm not very good at these games generally.Overall though, I have to say for the price you're paying, you're getting a solid horizontal shooter. It's fun and a little mindless, and if that's what you're looking for, I give this a big thumbs up. If you're looking for a pixel perfect extremely difficult precision bullet hell, however, look elsewhere."

Much like baking a cake the game contains all the standard ingredients required to make something worthwhile, however it lacks the crucial ""fun"" factor which leaves it pretty tasteless. For example the background music is ok, nothing special. The controls are ok but not super tight, the enemies start to blur into the same routine and all look the same after playing for a while. Weapon upgrades are minor and uninteresting. You'll get ample achievements for just playing the game and not doing anything noteworthy. The backgrounds however are fantastic and full credit to whoever made them, they stand out beautifully.Once you get playing for a bit you'll notice there is sort of a lack of challenge in this title. You'll ditch your standard laser weapons early on as they become useless and do hardly any damage to the enemies. Instead spamming heat seeking missiles will take care of anything that heads your way. You're given a few lives per level so never really need to worry about failing too much. The game lasts for a couple of hours, however I had to do it over 2 sessions as I just got bored of the gameplay. I came back to knock it over as I'm a completionist and wanted to 100% it, but the game felt the same on the later levels that it did in the beginning. Most times it felt more like a chore than fun, which is why I was able to listen to a podcast the entire time and not pay too much attention to the game.Technically the game runs well and I didn't experience any game crashes or bugs, which is why I'll give it the thumbs up rating. The quality of the overall package is actually pretty good but once again it just feels a bit ""meh"" after playing it. I got it on heavy discount for 30 odd cents so for the price it's worth a look. Steam cards help offset the measly price I paid but still it's not a memorable gaming experience to brag about. Probably suit the younger gamers with all the stuff blowing up and the skill level required (if it was actaully designed solely towards kids then disregard my complaints). In closing I'm just shrugging my shoulders on this game. I can't really endorse it, nor can I partically fault it as it does what it's designed to do. You could do a hell of a lot worse in the world of steam shovelware though."

Sadly, this mechanic was weakly done, with very little variety.I played the game on easy, and oh wow was it easy. I think I only had to redo a level once. Cant say about the difficulty curb, but endless mode got really boring.With a name like Duke of Alpha Centauri, I was hoping there would be some kind of story to the game, but was dissapointed. Some may think a game like this doesnt need a story, but if ""I am bread"" can have a story, then so can this.My biggest gripe is the controls.
