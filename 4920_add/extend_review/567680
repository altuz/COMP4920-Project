Hard to explain how bad this game is need to see how to believe, if you want to play the worst or the worst download. If money is something you have to think about then avoid, each round requires you to get to a random point on the map. 20 items to collect to completly do everything in the game, about 20-30minutes of gameplay max.Video:https://youtu.be/wRvCZaTVKB4"

,Not Recommended,567680,29583472,Posted: 30 January,all,[hlife] Hotdog,"I’m all for the expression of art in games, I’ve argued on its behalf many times, but there is a point where I cannot understand nor express the development of art in video game format. Perhaps I am simply not enlightened (and I use this word seriously) enough to appreciate certain mediums. Though I think this is true of all people and that a portion will never ‘get the point’ of certain types of artwork. My father was an artist and dabbled in level design when I used to make maps for Half-Life. I didn’t understand some of his level designs. I usually found them clunky, unappealing and pointless, but he seemed to like them a great deal.Perhaps there is another method of thought going on. I am certainly no artist in the traditional sense. I apply more logical and process-based thought. When I think of a video game, I think of the story, the setting, the flow of ideas and narrative. To me, The Pasture applies a more abstract line of thought. More of personal expression of individual ideas and art as a whole. I acknowledge that it’s not in line with my understanding, but this means I struggle to view it as it is intended. Some people who have played this game seem to have grasped a meaning to it, but the conversation is one-sided as I cannot meaningfully respond. To put it another way, I simply don’t believe that the medium of a video game properly translates what the creator is trying to achieve, at least in my mind.On the other hand, perhaps it’s simply a collection of random objects and functions put into video game format and has no higher meaning. Perhaps it’s just a♥♥♥♥♥♥game that someone threw together. That’s what the people are here for. To critique and pass judgement.Either way, I liked some of the art pieces that were displayed. I suppose I at least got a little knowledge of Russian art.I’m not going to say I represent a majority of people, but for a base-grade consumer of video games, I don’t believe they would ‘get it’, as they say. If you think you can interpret another’s thought process, then go ahead and play The Pasture. All I can say I really got out of it was some achievements and some Steam cards."

I am waiting to see how it develops.   I went on this morning for a quick"" look see"" to see if I could find some art that would just make me crack up laughing before a long work day but it took just too long to load and do anything.  Maybe it was my computer...."

,Recommended,567680,29796907,Posted: 9 February,all,Jory,"it's disarming and a little scattered but i think it actually makes some interesting points? i don't know, it's a stretch, but it's confrontational enough to be really interesting. wandering around waiting to get inside the museum is pretty clumsily designed but otherwise the game has some cool mechanical ideas that definitely have the power to affect you.there's also a chance the game is just a goof but i'm not too sure. anyway, i was into it for how cheap it is and have so far bought no fewer than four copies for my friends."

76561198085675458,Recommended,567680,29462442,Posted: 24 January,all,gamer,"I wonder what  everyone is so confused about?  this is  a simple fetch game where you collect 20 art pieces to learn info about them. If you pay attention to the title menu and credits, you will notice that this game is made by a group of college students.The backward control, quotes  and rambling voices are just  gimmicks  to give illusion of depth.  characters' slow movements and  death( kinda like overheat in racing game)  are there  to  prolong what actually a very short game.Do I recommend this  game?   well  i got it for less than one dollar and because of this game, now  i know russian  artists like  David Ter-Oganyan and Boris Orlov.   so  I recommend this only to those who are not saving money to buy a particular game.By the way,  the art master and the art racer achievements are broken. you  have to collect  certain number of art pieces  within a time limit, but the collected arts didn't reset after you died or  go to the meeting point"
,Recommended,567680,29349582,Posted: 18 January,all,ToxicTromeo,"Are you a fan of Russian contemporary art?  Ever wanted to have your own art gallery? What about being chased by a man looking to beat you to death with an eggplant?  If so then this game is for you!The Pasture is a somewhat bizarre game revolving around your character essentially exploring an art museum.  You walk backwards while being ""chased"" by one of two art curators (?). As you walk a meter fills up. Fill it up all the way and you will die and need to start over.  The overall game itself isn't terribly long and offers a small amount of replayability in getting ""awards"" for doing various tasks such as reaching the goal in a minute or collecting all the art work.The cheap price tag really helps sell the game because beyond the awards you can work towards there's not much reason to come back to the game when you're done.  But it's definitely interesting both gameplay-wise and visually, funny at times, and definitely bizarre.  So if you got a spare dollar laying around and looking for something a bit weird, I'd say give it a go.  If anything it's got achievements and trading cards.My horrible playthrough of it:https://youtu.be/rSd0OOkhtns"
