,Not Recommended,567800,29006710,Posted: 4 January,all,Moon The Mischievous,"Not recommended for 100% achievement huntersAchivement hunters read the next paragraph.For rest of review, it's further down.This first part of the review discusses just one aspect, and is responsible for my negative review.Buying and playing for the achievements to make a perfect game.In the previous games in the series the achievements have always been simple enough to get, there was just one tough one ""beat the devs"". You have to beat the devs score on 10 levels out of the 50 (or 55 if you include bonus levels). This has always been challenging and has provided some discussion in the forums with people helping each other out and sharing the level they managed to ""beat the dev on""However...for part VI they have put an achievement in where you have toBEAT THE DEV ON EVERY LEVEL.For a game marketed as causal, that's anything but, and will require hours and hours of grinding to learn the levels enough to beat the dev time on every level.There is also an achievement for earning all other achievements -without beating all the dev times, you can't win that one either.So beware game completionists, this one is going to be a nightmare!This achievement has been discussed with the dev team on the discussion thread which you can find here -http://steamcommunity.com/app/567800/discussions/0/154644349172497172/The devs decision was this:(post 47 of that thread linked above)Karyna (JetDogs) posted:Hello everyone!Ok, I have been thinking about that situation and I've remembered that week ago one user wrote me a message that he is totally satisfied with Hercules-6 because of achievements! He told, that in previous parts it was easy to get 100% and it was not interest for him. Sixth part is the most favorite for him now because there are some work and aim. And he asked more hard achievements in next part.Sooo, we can't be good for each of you and satisfied each of you. You should understand that we need to change level of hardness because it is more interesting than play the same level 6 times.If 100% is important for you, so get it. It doesn't work in that way in world ""I want to feel myself like a winner, so please remove this part because I can not go through with it"". If you study in university and you can't pass the test would you ask teacher to make this test easier because you don't want to spend a lot of time with preparing but you want to get 100 points with this test? I do understand that Hercules-6 and studying in university are different things, but there works the same principle - if you want to be a winner in things you want to be you should to do something more for that.---Not playing for achievements review---If you aren't playing for achievements and just want a fun, cheerful game that you can play without really engaging your brain too much then this is definitely it!The animation is great, the artwork is superb and very detailed and even looks fantastic on a 40"" 4K screen, it's certainly something you could play through a TV!There are some new bonuses for this latest version including the Trident which gives you unlimited workers for a short period of time, it's amazing to activate it and madly click on all the things you need doing and have them done in seconds, really fun!ReplayabilityYou can score bronze, silver and gold on each level depending on how long it takes you to complete and the score you get. You also have to find a hidden stone on each level, collect them all and you unlock a jigsaw puzzle, collect that and you unlock a secret level.There is some good replayability here for casual players.So for casual gamers I highly recommend game.For achievement hunters looking for another game to get a perfect game on - keep clear, this one isn't for you. The good news is Hercules parts I, II, III, IV and V are all easy 100% completes so definitely play those!"
,Recommended,567800,30429250,Posted: 10 March,all,talgaby,"Short version: 86%The sixth 12 Labours of Hercules game finally drops all pretence and just targets the series veterans. It may scare away those who look for a casual experience, but players who want some challenge in a time management game will love it.Long version:I hope you are a long-time player of the 12 Labours of Hercules series, because Race for Olympus—and this review—targets this particular demographic.If I want to describe this game in short, then it feels like as if the series finally grew up and left the kiddie gloves at home. There are no more cheap gimmicks like thieves, evil clones, or even needless road art, just pure time management challenge. The road layouts and the resource placement ensure that the workers do not travel needlessly long distances, but in return the game expects forward planning, careful stock management (probably the strongest aspect), and meticulous execution.Achievement hunters will (justly) complain about the new requirement of beating all developer records to 100% the game, which is another indication of how the series moved past casual game territory. Those whom dare to tackle the challenge will find one of the purest and best entries of this long series, one that can be a source of frustration but also many triumphant moments."
,Recommended,567800,28517685,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,bluebreezer,It's good to see another installment. This series still remains one of the most polished time management games on steam.Highly recommended when you're up for either a challenge or some relaxation.Do check out earlier games in the series as well. Thumbs up.

The mechanics and flow have greatly improved since the 1st in this series.  There are new bonuses, like the unlimited workers bonus (which has been quite handy).  There are a couple new achievements such as the beat all the dev records (I'm not that hardcore).  This series continues to be a fun time management game that can be played by everyone from the casual to the hardcore gamer."
,Recommended,567800,34108276,Posted: 8 August,all,CGFW (Jayanta),"For achievement hunters: This one is also like the previous games except few new things introduced like unlimited labour bonus tools etc. However, the logic is same! But the hardest part is beating all developer records achievement and that is really really difficult until you are not able to figure out the shortest path / way. So, be patient and first try in casual mode to figure out the process; you can also check the in-game guide to know how the work follow should move on. Yes, take it as a challenge and you must be able to overcome it as it may be difficult but not impossible!For casual gamers: You guys are jack of all trades but master of none! :) So, what’s wrong to kill some time in this cute game as u do in other games? ;)"

They introduce a few new environments, which are cool.  Most of the mecanics are the same or similar to the other installments in the franchise.  And, of course, it comes with the puzzles and castle pieces for completing levels in gold time, as well as the ""H"" tiles hidden on the maps.  What else can I say?  If you like the franchise, you'll like this.  I certainly enjoyed it.  For a few bucks, it provides a few hours of fun."
,Not Recommended,567800,31206166,Posted: 17 April,all,Tiagovsk,"Developers overrated the replay value of this game. It is the 6th instance of a game that, all in all, is more of the same, and yet, they want you playing over and over again in order to beat their time.No, unfortunatelly this game is not worth that much time even though it is fun.I also need to mention the great work they did with the soundtrack, really beautiful tunes."

76561197998177676,Not Recommended,567800,31058887,Posted: 10 April,all,Hassat Hunter,"Sadly, I think this series goes the wrong way. The first ones were fun, I abandoned the last one. Complicated levels, lack of overview, heck I even had to made a forum post being stuck since there was a ""hidden"" path that you were forced to go on.I waved it off as maybe being fatigue of the series, so after a large pause this game was released and I picked it up for 50 cents.Sadly, it seems that it wasn't fatigue. While the earlier games kept down to the ground, the rather insanely complicated level designs totally put me off here. Roads you can barely see (one level on a iceplate for example), a flasket in the middle that seems decoration but is actually travable, a map consisting  of 15 portals. No, no thanks. I prefer to come here for time-trials. Not how the heck does THIS map work and then having to re-do it after being bronze since I missed a gazillion roads because these maps construction are not easy on the eye at all.Less gimmick please. I want to fight time, not the map's layout."

,Recommended,567800,30686243,Posted: 23 March,all,dozinGreen,"I don't understand why people are complaining about beating all the developer's records. If you read thorugh the guide on left down corner on each map, combing with the skills, it is not that hard at all. The gmae requires you to think and use time wisely. It is fun and challenging. I enjoy it a lot."

If you like one of them, you'll like them all, because there aren't any drastic differences from one to the next. They're colorful, involve a lot of clicking, and sometimes some thought if you want gold on every level, but they're also perfect for when you just have a few minutes to spend."

The previous Hercules games had beat the developers score 10 times and I could manage to get those, but this one is beat ALL the developers records I can say for sure this will be the one in the series I will not get all the achievements (2 will remain unfinished that and Earn every achievement).  Oh well I still enjoy the game."

76561198027999803,Recommended,567800,29776966,Posted: 7 February,all,Scarface,Same of the other 12 Labours of Hercules games. Can get you a day of fun. Fits its price.
76561198052965201,Recommended,567800,29940794,Posted: 15 February,all,Derrick Rifkin,"Game Mechanics:The game continues the time and resource management trend of the previous installments of the series, but at the very least there's no thieves now. The hidden objects within the levels also make a return, though not every level seems to have them. Another returning feature are the additional characters and the puzzle pieces, which (when collected and after solving a simpole jigsaw) unlock a bonus level.Plot: the plot is incredibly simple, as has become the standard with this series, Zeus is missing from Olympus and it seems that the other Gods are responsible. With the leader of the Olympian Gods missing a poll will be held to decide on the next ruler. Hercules sets off to find Zeus and punish the one responsible.Presentation:The game looks and feels like a mobile game, but the visuals are crisp and well-designed, and I can't help but mention the rather enjoyable mellow music (especially within Poseidon's realm and the desert). Some hidden objects blind in quite a bit with the background and some of the level design makes the layout confusing, but it's not actually a big hindrance.Completion:All achievements, except for beating the developer's score, are pretty easily obtainable. That last one seems require a bit of grinding and a good grasp of the game's mechanics and precise planning."
