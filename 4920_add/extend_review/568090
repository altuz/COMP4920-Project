I know she stashed them somewhere in the basement so I go looking and find the best present any kid could ask for......And find the most annoying little fur brained doll I've ever seen.He gets hungry, I feed him.He gets dirty, I groom him.He gets tired, I charge him.It's like playing Tamagochi while an Axe murderer is running around the house trying to kill you.Definitely a great way to ruin Christmas for your kid.If you're too scared to play, then you can always watch me do it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb6bg-eQ6Zo"

It's not without its challenges but compared to games like Outlast, Cursed Forest and Amnesia this game is simple.  As someone who's played lots of horror games I didn't find this game terrifying but I did feel uneasy when Mama was after me.  This game is also short, but that doesn't make it bad.  You should be able to play the whole thing in one sitting.  This is a great horror game if you're in the mood for something short and sweet or if you're just getting into horror games and want to start out on something not too extreme.Pros:Furby horror game lolShort and sweetPlays on classic fears like the dark and something is after you.Easy gameplayWell developedGood priceCons:None"
,Recommended,568090,29120559,Posted: 8 January,all,Cheru,"If you're a product of the 80s or 90s, you'll almost certainly remember when Furby hit the market and the mass hysteria that every kid and their dog had in wanting to own one. Hell, I was one of them.If you ever had a Furby, then you'll undoubtedly remember the first time he woke you up in the middle of the night, demanding food and telling you that he wanted to play, as his little mechanical beak mouth ground its way open and closed, open and closed, open and closed. The cold sweat dripping slowly down the sides of your temples, as you hid under your blanket thinking that as long as you couldn't see Furby, Furby couldn't see you. Yeah. You know EXACTLY what I'm talking about. Don't you?Tattletail is basically this traumatic period of your childhood life, recreated in game form. The only difference is that this Furby, or rather this Furby's mother, is a little more dangerous than the dubious robo-pets we all used to have in our bedrooms as kids. Don't let her find you, cause you know what'll happen. Oh, you don't know? Well, I can't tell you. Don't wanna be a tattletale!-------------------------------------------If you think this game might be for you, you're welcome to take a look at my first 3 nights in the video below -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLkLpbqM9vU&feature=youtu.be"
,Recommended,568090,29286396,Posted: 15 January,all,ARuarkGuy,Tattletail is one of the best horror games I have ever played. This game brings you the creeps and a story to this game as well. It brings fear to people who have toys and that they may come to life. This will bring the fear of the unkown and it's really good at scaring you. The gameplay is unique and you'll love everything about it. Good graphics too. Every night has unique task that is great and so that you will have to experience something new everytime so that you'll never get bored. When I first played this game I didn't know what I was expecting at first but when I played more I was scared. It brought fear to me and when I got jumpscared I froze in my seat saying that this is good. I kept playing and it every night brought more to it and at the end it all payed off. Sort of. There are also easter eggs for all of you scavenger hunters out there. And achievments to collect for all of you achievment hunters out there too. So this game will provide a lot to everyone and a lot for everyone to enjoy. I recommend this game to everyone who not only loves horror games but who loves a challenge as well.
,Not Recommended,568090,28955538,Posted: 2 January,all,chainsawsuit,"I'm saying ""no"" to recommending this game, but it's a very soft no. Tattletail relies most on the jump scare upon losing the game. The core concept is lovingly 1980s VHS-blasted, so my hopes were high, but there wasn't enough here to keep me playing once the gameplay mechanics had been laid bare.Not having played any other jump scare games, though, I suspect that's the defining feature of the genre -- just barely avoiding a startling and noisy death. It's not something that creeps me out, but you might have a better time, and the price is super reasonable."

FINISH THE GAME BEFORE CONTINUING---Upon not collecting all the eggs/answered the call/both, Mama kills you, for the ritual was unsuccessful.Upon getting all the eggs and not answering the phone, however, will reward you with your very own cuddly and lovely Tattletail! AND A GOLDEN FLASHLIGHT THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE LIFE SPAN OF A LAPTOP!---WATCH OUT! DURING YOUR PRESENT OPENING AND KNOCKING ON YOUR MOTHER'S DOOR, AN EERIE MUSIC WILL PLAY. DO NOT PANIC UPON HEARING THE EERIE MUSIC---Whilst the map itself is small, it still is pretty good.---NO MORE SPOILERS FROM HERE---Final verdict is 9/10. A well designed game that looks like a low budget horror game (FNAF), is not related to FNAF, and it's 5 BLOODY BUCKS!I recommend this game for a short amount of fear and horror."

When you manage to build the courage and head towards the basement you find the gift that was at the top of your Christmas list... Tattletail. This little ♥♥♥♥er is the♥♥♥♥♥♥of the town. The fatty eats all of your food, wants to be brushed constantly, and has the battery lifespan of a dying potato battery powering a clock. After you unbox the little furball he wants to get some food so he can become an even larger ball of fur.Since you are a helpless little kid who can't say no to a toy who literally won't stop shouting about wanting a treat no matter how many times you hit it against the washing machine you give in. He eats through your refridgerator like a truck. Shortly after, he then needs to be groomed so he can be one sexy son of a ♥♥♥♥♥.After using your mother's hairbrush she left conviently lying on the couch for the past few weeks you finally decide to shove the little guy back into his little box.

Rushing downstairs to find out what the hell is making so much noise you find the little♥♥♥♥♥♥trying to kill itself inside of the same washing machine you constantly smashed it against to get it to stop shouting.I would continue from here on out, but the adventures of Sir Random Parentless Child and Squire Furby-Knockoff is a heavily story driven game that truly needs to be experienced by the player."

Just the fact that I'm really scared of Furby's and all those other Robot Pets that you'd have as a Kid, It's very Impressive anyone could make a game Like This, and The Mama Character... Let's Just say... I honestly love the Scare Factor It brings in, so for anyone looking at the Reviews Right now to See if the game is good, I recommend It to you, Mama is easily Horrifying, I could tell it was bloodthirsty from the Twisting Head and the Deathly Glare in It's eyes, The Jumpscares are a Bit Cheesy and look Horrible, but other than that, It's a very well game! I hope this gets a sequel sometime in the Near Future, I've always thought Furby's killed people as a Kid and I still have that thought to this Day, This game brings back those memories and this game will send Chills down my spine everytime I play It, Thank you for This Amazing Game."
,Recommended,568090,28989819,Posted: 3 January,all,idreamofwires,"I'm almost an hour into Tattletail. So far, it's an incredibly charming, well-made game. The gameplay loop is incredibly fun, and genuinely scary. It's definitely a game that really shines when you make a point to play it late at night, with all the lights off. Sure, there are jump scares in there, but for me it'd be totally wrong to dismiss this game as relying on cheap scares in order to punish you. There's a lot more nuance and soul to the game. You can really tell that it's creator has poured a lot of love into it.The overall aesthetic and feel of the game, I expect will be incredibly polarising. I really liked Tattletail's unique style, and I think they got the distorted/lofi/VHS glitch thing down perfectly. People who like this sort of thing, generally love it. Others won't really resonate with it, and that's absolutely fine. I get the impression that the low price point will help make this game accessible to people who wouldn't usually play this sort of game. It's definitely worth picking up if you're looking for a charming, strange and genuinely scary game to spend a dark evening alone (or with friends) with."
,Recommended,568090,29156657,Posted: 9 January,all,Psyker,"Tattletail, although obviously inspired by FNaF, gave me a much more enjoyable experience than any of the FNaF games.***SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT***Pros:+Great atmosphere, keeps you on the edge of your seat+Tattletail only adds to this atmosphere. While creepy in the beginning, he quickly becomes your best friend in the fight against mama+Keeps you wondering about the world and the backstory behind Tattletail+The jumpscare's sound isn't boosted +50db above every other sound in the game (this was my main problem with FNaF)+Text effects are flashy and appealing to the eye, along with other smooth and quick animations that add to the urgency of some situations+Voices and other sounds are great in keeping you in the world+I had no idea how much of an impact making sound had until day 3Cons:-Mechanics of Mama are difficult to understand (this one has been made a lot better with the gift update)-I spent like 2 hours trying to see if there was any way for me to get past the fence gate in the back (there wasn't)Overall, very enjoyable horror game; atmosphere was good, effects were smooth, tattletail was lovable, and the best part was being scared of the jumpscare instead of being scared of the earbursting sound that came with it. Really hope the devs keep updating this one and let us in Tattletail's world."
,Recommended,568090,32580941,Posted: 19 June,all,RedDeadBlaze,"I honestly wasn't hype for playing Tattletale, i saw people making youtube videos about it but it didn't interest me. I have heard songs about it and i saw some of the SFM of the songs people made for the game and i was like ""This game looks kinda cool"" so i hoped on steam and bought it for a cheap $5 (Which is one of the ups about this game) and booted it up.Man oh man this game scared the crap out of me, The game is you have to survive five nights (Not like Fnaf 5 nights) till christmas with your new friend Tattletale, but his Mama doesn't like you all that much and... well play the game and see for yourself.The only complaint i have is i have a windows 10 desktop and for fullscreen i need to set the resolution to 1980 x 1080 but it runs slow if i set it like that. So i have to run it at 640 x 400 for it to run without lag. Maybe it's just my computer but that's the only problem i have with this game but besides that it's a good game.Anyways thats my opinion on Tattletale, if you do buy it then i hope you enjoy it and Thanks For Reading."

,Recommended,568090,29427556,Posted: 22 January,all,CoolSkeleton95,"When I first heard of this game, I said: ""Oh. A Furby-themed horror? That sounds a little boring.""Boy, was I wrong.Tattletail is a game that's based around a Furby-type virtual pet called a ""Baby Talking Tattletail"". You're tasked with grooming it, feeding it and charging it's battery, all whilst avoiding the grasp of it's bloodthirsty mama in a small, dark house. You are given only a flashlight to protect yourself, and while this might sound like the typical ""Run away from the baddie in the dark"" horror game, it's far from it.Tattletail happens to be the one thing that will get you killed. When hiding from Mama, you'll have to be sure you've got plenty of light, Tattletail hates the dark, as well as having to keep him fed, clean and charged at the same time.The story is pretty simple. YOu're a small, curious and naughty child that opened their Christmas present early, and inside was a Baby Talking Tattletail, the newest from the WayGetters electronics line of products. As you tend to the thing, you'll start being hunted by the previously discontinued ""Mama Tattletail"", who is no longer available to purchase for unknown reason.Despite the story being so straightforward, the gameplay is something you'll NEVER forget.tl;dr: Buy the game because spooky Furby hide and seek in the dark. It's fun.10/10 IGN Would fear Furbies again."

The game mechanics were incredibly simple and easy to pick up... and there really isn't a lot of depth to the game: just don't get caught. I was a bit put out with the inconsistent frame rate, as this can make eluding Mama harder in the unfair/frustrating way than a genuine game difficulty way.Don't get me wrong... I can appreciate simple, short games (expect to finish it in ~1-1.5 hours). It allowed me a casual distraction from the work I should probably be getting done. However, if you're looking for a legitimately frightening horror game experience, I suggest you look elsewhere. This is basically a mashup of FNAF and Among the Sleep... which isn't necessarily a bad thing as long as you know what you're getting for your $5."

76561198259499385,Recommended,568090,28815651,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,neoeeveethenerd,"Would recommend if you've got five bucks to spend, a few hours to kill, and the aesthetic or concept of haunted nineties toys appeals to you. My sister doesn't find this kind of thing scary but I, personally, am a pansy and was tense the entire time. Fear is subjective. The game's not horribly broken, it's not hideous, and it has original thoughts in its head, and sometimes that's all you can ask.That said, it ain't perfect. Spoilers below probably?There are some pacing problems to the game over all. When the game is teaching you about itself, you're not really in any danger to speak of. Multiple nights go by without the possibility of a failstate. There are clearly delineated sections where you can't die. In some cases, this is a good thing. It gives you an intermission and a moment to breathe, and it's not like Five Nights where you constantly feel like you're on the verge of a heart attack.However, I feel like it ramps up from this into its final challenge way too fast. If you're a chickenshit like me and not stopping to figure out how the monster's systems work (and why would you, you're supposed to avoid it), you're hosed. It's a ninety degree brick wall of a difficulty spike. Furthermore, the final level drops most of the systems the game had been working with (that is, you don't carry Tattletail around) and becomes much more Slender-esque, a challenge of finding a series of objects in an enclosed space with the monster constantly teleporting around you. And then you die. You die a lot. And then you see the jumpscare game over screen. A lot. And then gradually the horror wears off as you feel your way around for a strategy to find those damn candles and shut up those Furby knock-offs and their ""no more Mama"", creeping around in the basement with your flashlight off and hoping shaking it on again won't summon the beast. It's more slog than fun, because the candle placement is randomized, too. The last level is a pretty big let down, but the Tattletails in their little Satanic circle like we'd always joked about in elementary school kept me playing because I was honestly kind of intrigued to see what would happen next. That's the power of a good concept.Having a jumpscare stinger ending is really cheap though. Come on, guys, really?I can't say I regretted the two hours I spent playing through it in exchange for my five dollars and I hope this concept can be improved upon. It's certainly unique, which is what drew me to the game in the first place. But I don't think calling it ""storydriven"" is totally accurate and the constantly escalating stinger ambiance music wears thin after awhile, though where sound design is concerned I will applaud the devs for not using a horrible screaming noise every single time you die. It's charming enough and it will probably rekindle my deepseated childhood fear of basements. Thanks for that one, guys."

In a world of FNaF games where Anamatronics are always the big threat coming to kill you...being a kid running from a deadly toy screamed ""CHILDHOOD MEMORIES!"" I felt it was a great concept for a horror game. Onto how it handles, the audio is done well, the music stings kept me on edge the entirety of the first level, and the atmosphere is all there. For a $5 game, I felt it was totally worth the money.I'm only on the third night, and so far I haven't felt like gimmicky scares are everywhere which is what I was afraid of. I don't know if it was just me, but I survived the first and second night no problem...which is good. With FNaF (yeah, going to keep comparing the two even though they aren't alike at all) you get killed for reasons you don't understand. I'm very happy to announce at the moment I haven't experienced death for the sake of random death. The game is actively teaching me mechanics while keeping me on edge. If you'd like to see how the game runs, how the game sounds, and how the game plays, here is my experience for the first two nights.https://youtu.be/Ev1DQC_dVCEI believe Night 3 is where stuff is going to really start cooking and I can't wait to play some more."

The fact that he eats real food is disturbing right from the get-go, hahaha.If I had to gripe about something, it would be that this tiny child apparently wears steel-toed boots to bed, and everywhere around the house, Kind of unsettling hearing these loud heavy footsteps coming from a 10-year-old plodding across a carpet :P But maybe it's for effect since all of your own noises sound louder when you're up past your bedtime and trying to be quiet.

,Recommended,568090,30486592,Posted: 13 March,all,Rumpus,"I'll open this review by saying something quickly: Tattletail does not run very well. Others have this problem as well, you can get less than 14 FPS while playing. While it sounds bad, it's still playable and not a game-ruining issue.Now that that is out of the way, on with the review!So, everybody and their dog has heard of F.N.A.F (and don't worry, I won't compare it to it that much), Tattletail also utilises jumpscares as its primary source of scare, along with REALLY UNECESSARILY SCARY NOISES. Tattletail is spooky, fast and very unforgiving, especially with what you might expect. You play as a child, who like all of us, really REALLY wanted to open his / her presents, just days before Christmas. So, you sneak down to the basement, despite hearing aLOTof things you shouldn't hear from the basement. And what's down there making all that noise?You guessed it. Tattletail. He's the hot new toy hitting shelves just in time for Christmas! He eats real food, and goes through your fridge like it's full of chicken nuggets, but the sexy cutie Furby-like guy needs some serious styling as well, so be sure to keep him brushed! Don't forget his batteries (Not included) also need charging, or else he'll be no fun! He also likes to invite some ""friends"" over for a ""party"" sometimes.This is a very short game, like FNAF, but it has a quirky charm to it: You have to take care of Tattletail. He is so frigging loud as well. Like, on par with that meme where Bart Simpson shouts ""testing"" into 50 megaphones all lined up. Tattletail is a cutie though, so you can kind of forgive him for being a loud fuzzy fuzzball.I really don't want to say more, because this is a short game and you should find out for yourself, but I will say this:• Tattletail's needs are worth more than your own.• Tattletail always knows.• Mama is looking after you.Expect surprises, spooks, and cutie fuzzy friends in this delightful indie horror!"

The graphics and the sounds gave me goosebumps when I even got to the starting screen. It was full of nostalgia and has really made my uncomfortable attitude towards Furbies even more noticable than before. At first I was only going to do a single let's play video, but ended up creating a whole series on this game because I enjoyed it so much with my friends and wanted to beat it. I really think people who enjoy jumpscares should play this game.I just started uploading the videos to my YouTube channel too!https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQlK2bdGa6CWZag1gsWhnnubx3-42QXJu"
,Recommended,568090,29289595,Posted: 15 January,all,Regen,"While short, this game is totally worth it. Tattletail is a game built around atmosphere and nostalgia. It offer's a wide assortment of different mini-games for each night instead of keeping to a formula like a certain game involving killer animatronics. Which was what I was personally expecting Tattletail to be like due to that franchises popularity. Let's say I was pleasantly surprised. The VHS aesthetic is VERY creepy and adds a lot to the horror factor. The voice acting is fantastic and lets you grow close to your Furby friend whenever he's not getting you in trouble. But with every great thing, there are always flaws. Let's start with the obvious one; the clunky controls. My main issue with it is the mouse sensitivity. While the newest ""The Gift"" Update has improved upon the problem, a 4 on the sensitivity scale still feels like a 10. For example, while playing on default mouse sensitivity whenever I simply tapped my mouse, the main character did a 360. This next one is more of a personal con. I think that Tattletails individual needs bars go down to fast. Most times whenever I was trying to hide from Mama Tattletail, presumably away from the places that'll restore one of Tattletail's needs, one of the furry little s*@#'s needs will drop to zero which will trigger him to start making a lot of noise that'll attract Mama quickly. For this one, I have some simple resolutions that I'm sure not only I want. Maybe if there were more places to restore Tattletail's needs, it'll make it just a tad bit easier not to be caught. Or, obviously, just lowering the digression speed of Tattletail's needs. That being said, I really love this game and I want to see it blossom but I fear it'll be looked down upon do to these issues. Hopefully my critiques will be resolved or improved upon."

(Usually I don't play horror because I get scared, but this horror is must-play to be honest ;) )To improve: Please add subtitles! Sometimes it's difficult for me to understand what little tattletail was saying because I am deaf :P (though I got hearing aid to be able to hear 'mama') And there is other players who's deaf aswell ^^I hope there will be Tattletail 2 getting implemented.  If it is, maybe add the ""endless mode"" feature where it's always night and you always have to look after tattletail and survive 'mama' encounters (And maybe add in the leaderboard for worldwide competition where you can see which player survives the longest on endless mode)Overall, this game totally worth £3.99 tbh!

Relies mostly on a light creepy factor with a few jumpscares a la FNAF, which don't really hit that hard (probably as a result of the lighter tone which doesn't instill the sense of anxiety that some scarier titles might provide). Music is nice, and would really set the tone well if the content was better at switching it up when the creep factor is supposed to hit.The Kaleidoscope update is rather odd, and introduces some off-beat storytelling; but it does pad out the gameplay a bit.All in all, were it priced any higher I'd say avoid it, but it's pretty cheap so not bad honestly.

,Recommended,568090,28779269,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,Candy man,"I'm not gonna lie, I was super hype when I saw the trailer and rushed to buy it.A short but intense and well thought out horror game, Tattletail is already growing near and dear to my heart. The designs are adorably uncanny valley, and charming. The gameplay keeps you on your toes, having to rush to take care of your loud, obnoxious virtual pet while you are being hunted down by ""Mama"", an antagonist that still gives me the creeps.I had to have my roommate come outside with me when taking out the trash.Overall, I cannot recommend this game enough. GREAT job to the team behind this, I'm unsure if this is your first horror game, but keep it up! This really set up a cool and stressful atmosphere.9/10"
76561198007048013,Recommended,568090,28965905,Posted: 2 January,all,Enixic,"This game took me about an hour or so to beat. It isn't complex in the slighest and is a great tribute to those of us who grew up in the 90's. It is similar to the format of the FNAF games in terms of cycling through nights- though the first person aspect is pretty enjoyable. In terms of the modeling everything is pretty simple, however, it doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the game. It is a quick play- so don't expect really anything else, and once you have seen the jumpscare it gows tiresome pretty quickly. Overall though I think the developer made a fun, short, little horror game based off of an existing toy most of us 90's kids understood the oddities of. Just don't go into this looking for a bigger story than what is there. As the developers first published game I enjoyed it. I am excited to see more of what is to come from this team/individual."

Tattletail is no exception to this. I've played countless indie horror games and I find most of them to be rather disappointing.However, Tattletail is a great little horror game about an animatronic doll much like Furby. The game sports neon colors and glow effects which I loved and the sounds and gameplay are balanced and very nice. I don't see a lot of good horror games, but this one is great to waste some time on! It doesn't take very long to beat; maybe an hour to an hour and a half.There are 22 secret eggs you can find throughout the game and I notice that there isn't a difference to the ending if you find them all or not. The game is set the few days before Christmas and you control a child who just wants to play with his toy early, the Tattletail.Overall, it's a great little buy and I recommend checking out some gameplay or play it yourself!"

It was a very creative idea and a well plotted game.When I first saw it, I thought isn't this just a copy of fnaf. Except, its NOT. Its so different. (And better in my opinion)For people who thought it was like it, give it a chance! It's build up before Mama jumpscares or appears. Is TERRFYING.The person/people who made this have done an amazing job and should be so proud of themselves. The sounds can fake you out easily making you think somethings gonna happen. (In the first night especially) Theres always that little thing that just makes you scared. Except you can't put your finger on it. Most games you can easily walk away from and think, that was a good game, but this really stuck with me like glue. Its kinda like a lost puppy. It's easily my favorite game now! AMAZING job!

Gameplay is slightly annoying to me. You have to go around and brush, feed, and charge Tattletail while making sure not to make noise around Momma. Tattletail has friends you have to play with. I played Hide-and-Seek 3 times during times in which Momma will be on the prowl while the friend hides. You can't make noise around Momma but if you look at her it kills your flashlight, recharging it makes noise, and Tattletail is scared of the dark so he'll just start howling. My biggest problem with the game however is that it isn't scary. After getting ""jumpscared"" the first time I wasn't scared of the game. Ambiance was great to keep you on your toes but after I got ""jumpscared"" the first time I was left with a feeling more akin to ""Is that it?"" after that even the ambiance lost it's edge. So no, I can't recommend this game."

,Recommended,568090,28830655,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,Skullstream,"Tattletail is a short jaunt through the excitement of being a 90's kid during the Christmas of 1998. As a game, Tattletail was an enjoyable hour and a half long experience. If you're looking for a lighter less frustrating version of a Five Nights at Freddy's type game with 3D exploration, creepy stry, memorable moments, and no camera system, you've found your outlet. I've certainly spent more $ on worse uses of my time, and wouldn't look back on this particular purchase. Overall I'd give it a 9/10 for what it is: An Indie Horror on a budget with a 1.5 hour playtime. Was I entertained for that 1.5 hours? You betcha!Full playthrough VoD here:https://www.twitch.tv/skullstream/v/110883955Some things about the game:The physical area that the game allows you to traverse is small, allowing you to gain familiarity with the house. This is good, since you'll need to remember where things are so that you may recharge, groom, and feed your Tattletail at short notice. At no point did I feel lost, or turned around when playing through the game, which lead to fairly linear progression with a few tough areas but not many. Short takeaway is that the repetitive sections are kept to a minimum.That does not mean the game does not have its hidden challenges or tense moments mind you as the final couple of nights can be a little jarring. And yes, the ""nights"" are set up very similarly to FNAF."

76561198063582863,Recommended,568090,29409247,Posted: 21 January,all,Monokuma,"Tattletail is a bit of a strange game to me as far as gameplay, mechanics and human psychology goes.Is this game scary? yes, yes it is... for a while. It can be very unsettling the first time you play tattletail and without saying any spoilers, can linger for quite a while.  I personally think the game to a certain point doesn't keep it's scare factor as you do get used to it very quickly. But with problems with the game, as glitches are concerned, there are quite a few here and there.1st, would be Mama herself. Don't get me wrong i do like how she attacks you, but it's HOW she attacks you... let me explain. Mama only attacks you if you make too much noise (or if you run into her like an idiot... like me), it's so scary to find her red glowing eyes cutting through the darkness... and thats it. She does attack you if you can't get away from her but for some weird reason, i had ran into Mama, she's staring at me, speaks, Tattletail freaks out from the darkness (and hungry)..... but nothing happens. i was just staring at her till she goes away. I even had a friend on my phone watching me play it and we couldn't stop wondering why she hasn't attacked me yet.2nd, this may be a spoiler or an exploit so stop reading this one if you haven't played yet. The timing of Mama coming after you when you're either making too much noise or Tattletail never shutting up. whenever i make too much noise with my flashlight or running steps, she can find me like im ringing a dinner bell. But strangly enough, i had Tattletail running out of power (sounds like this fish low on batterieshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHchmWsrfUo), but Mama was coming at me as if she was either very lazy or switched to moving in a wheel chair.3rd, im not sure if this is a glitch but something i've noticed. One day i had Mama killing me over and over because i was playing hide and seek with a Tattletale, but i respawn to the last time i spoke with that Tattletail. however, near the end of the game, i had to do a long list of tasks, but when Mama kills me, i had to start al the tasks over on that day.If i had to sum it all up, it is a great game... enough said."

The mechanics were pretty easy to get used to so there isn't as much challenge when you figure out the strategy but I think that could apply to any game.

,Recommended,568090,29311176,Posted: 16 January,all,GlitchBit Games,"Twas' the week before christmas, and al through the house, the Tattletail's were sturring, Mama ate a mouse.TattleTail is a fnaf styled horror game that takes place in the year 1989 on the same week as christmas. The most popular toy at the time was an almost copyright infringing toy that was very similar to the Furby toys all of us used to have. The goal is simple, survive until christmas day. The game is completly free roam for the players discression and even has a basement which plays a very important part near the end of the game. The difficulty that comes with this game is trying to avoid mama, and trying to avoid mama with Tattletail non-stop saying adorable and annoying qoutes. (seriously i want one of these in real life, i dont care if it would move around even if it didnt have batteries in it I WANT ONE SO BADLY!) During night 2 of TattleTail the player gets a flashlight that can only work when it is fully recharged and shaken up. You must avoid making any noise when mama is around because if you do...well lets just hope you dont mind missing a good chunch of your face.All and all, 12/10 on this game. i really loved it, plus it has an amazing replayability that i actually played it SEVEN TIMES trying to get all the friggen eggs, and i loved every second of it ^W^ i would LOVE a sequel for this game, all though im not sure if scott cawthon would be ok with that. if not a sequel, than some merchandise.

76561198335091951,Recommended,568090,31857911,Posted: 20 May,all,leemarie1111,"I for one love this game. It has a great story for all those theorists out there, and it's got the best quality. Like every other game, it has its ups and downs, but I'll recommend for this one because there's only a few details that are bad about it and I'm not known to be a picky pete.If you dont know what Tattletail is, well, here's the basics.You are a 10 year old boy from Florida who lives across from the Waygetter company, the ones who make the toy Baby Talking Tattletail. This young boy, Thomas, is very impatient for christmas to come. So impatient that he can't wait five days or he'll burst! He wakes up in the middle of the night to go downstairs into his basement and find his Christmas gift. Surprise surprise! It's a Baby Talking Tattletail! But this Tattletail won't stay in his box. He goes out to cause mischief and Thomas has to wake himself up every day until Christmas day to make sure that Tattletail gets into no trouble. But Tattletail's mother, Mama Tattletail, is upset about Thomas messing around with her son. The bloodthirsty Mama Tattletail, after two nights of watching Thomas grab and mess with her son, finally lets go of her patience and begins attacking poor Thomas. Now Thomas has two goals: One to keep Talking Tattletail from telling and making problems, and to survive Mama Tattletail's teeth. On Christmas Eve, Tattletail and his brothers decide to tell Thomas to get a ''party'' ready for Mama. But when Thomas gets the finishing touch, the candles, he finds the Tattletail family in a circle, christmas lights strung out on the floor, having some sort of ritual, chanting ''No more mama!'' Still confused, Thomas puts down and lights the candles, rewinding the VHS. Mama tattletail is not impressed and steals the candles so the deed cant be done and hides them in vases. Now Thomas has to survive Mama, deal with the annoyance of Tattletail's voice, AND noisily break the vases to find the candles. Finally he does, relights them for the Tattletail Tribe, and observes their ceremony. But Mama isn't done there. She escapes the banishment by hiding in Tattletail's original box. She comes out right before Thomas wakes up the next day, sneaks up behind him, and gives him a piece of her mind.Sorry if I just spoiled the game for you.Anyway, here we go.Pros:The 90's vibe is amazing.The graphics are 10 out of 10.Mama's design is on point, with all the rips and tears and the red glow in her eyes.Tattletail looks so adorable <3Cons:The camera wildly moves around faster than a normal mouse should.Tattletail's voice is a disgrace to humanity.Mama's jumpscare isn't too scary.On Christmas Eve, it takes you back to the start of the night, which I loathe.But even with the cons, this game is great and I'd buy it for $20.00! That's $15.00 extra for what I payed for this game, but it deserves more than it gets! I just don't understand why people call it a '''fnaf rip-off'' because it has nothing to do with FNaF. People think that all horror games are linked to FNaF, and it's sad that games like this don't get enough love just because some kids think that every horror game has to do with sitting on your♥♥♥♥♥in an office looking at a freaking robotic bear for 6 hours straight. But really, that's all I have to say. I hope this review helped! <3"

After playing for about an hour, I can truly say it is very entertaining & keeps me interested in seeing the end result!The Sound is what makes this game scary & is done very well. The jumpscares aren't bad, but if you like creepy atmosphere's & great sound in horror games, you surely will not be dissapointed!The Cons to this game are that maybe the ""alert ringing"" when Tattletail is scared or hungry can be quite piercing, so if you are wearing headphones, you may need to turn the sound down a little. The other con would be the jumpscare. It could use a quicker animation with some other screen filters that can elevate the dread the rest of the atmosphere already provides.All in all, cool & very entertaining while also being super affordable. Thanks!!!"

The art assets are a little rough too. If there were more ways to interact with the environment, it might be more interesting. It seems as though 'Mama's' location is updated every 5 seconds or so, and if the player happens to be in the volume that triggers her ""persue"" script, there isnt much of a way out of it, simply breaking the line of sight doesnt do it. Possibly an issue with geo? Oh also, include a volume slider in the settings, this game is loud af. Good start guys; but over valued at this point."

So you go ahead and peak a few days early - it's a Fur... Tattletail! The latest and greatest in robotic toys!  So you take the little fella' out of it's package and play with it.  And boy is it needy!  It wants food.  It wants to be brushed.  It needs to be charged. Doesn't care much for the dark, either.  So it'll nag you until you take care of it.  Oh yeah - it's Mamma is really, really protective.  So watch out for her!So for around five dollars or so you'll get about an hours worth of entertainment. Maybe a bit less if you rush.  A bit more if you try to get all the achievements.  There are also spiffy trading cards - which as of writing this review are going for quite a bit compared to most cards.https://youtu.be/OGmnsYUNv8Q"

You will be jumpscared a lot, which is not fun, at all (almost making the same game just putting a new coat of paint on it, oh wait that happened already) This game feels like a demo, not a full game.

(Lets go with that.)- Good graphics.- YOU GET TO HAVE A DEMONIC FURBY!! (Did I spell that right?)- The good ending is a good ending. (It's hard to get)Cons:- The graphics overpower my computer. (Don't buy if you have a sh** computer like mine.)- The bad ending is bad. (It's easy to get.)- Don't knock on moms door when mama is nearby. (jump scare)- The game can be beaten in one sitting. (Too short)- Jump scares get boring after one or two of them. (There is only one jump scare you can get)Serious timeOne problem with the game is that there is a problem with the computer specs you need to have in order to play the game with a good frame rate. I was at a friends house and he wanted this game on his computer (Which is better than mine) We checked his computer specs and his mac overpowered the game's specs. After the download we started the game and the frame rate was awful! It was IMPOSSIBLE to play. (There were no background processes and we also tried turning down the resolution)Do not buy unless you have a super great computer.So I give Tattletale a 5/10

Let's forget the annoying characters, the only mechanics in the game are fetch this, avoid Mama, and keep Tattletail fed, brushed, and charged. The problem is, none of these are fun. Mama is annoying and extremely easy to avoid as long as RNG doesn't decide to screw you over, the fetch quests are very repetetive, and the survival mechanic is basically nothing but a chore.

Not only is it extremely tedious, but it goes nowhere with the atmosphere it sets up, it's really easy when you figure out what to do, but you get attacked every few seconds, so its just the same thing happening over and over again, its boring, confusing, and not scary. I had no fun playing it, it's original. But still terrible. I see why some people may like it but I still hate it. maybe the DLC is phenominal, but I have no intention to play it."

The game looks amazing, and runs really well for me. I highly recommend that you don't watch any gameplay of this game before playing, that way it keeps you in the unknown and for this type of game, thats the best way to play it.One thing I would say however, is that the game mainly focuses on atmosphere rather than actual scares. The jumpscare that they have in the game gets rather repetitve after a few attempts. But again, atmosphere and suspense is key!"

It's just a shame that, in its final act, the game lets the player peek a bit too far behind the curtain."

After playing, watching and following lots of horror games, ones like this don't scare me anymore. But it DID make me laugh. There's a point where one of the Tattletails actually ""tattles"" on you, telling Mama where you and your Tattletail are hiding. It cracked me up.2. Simple, yet tense gameplay3. A genuinely amusing concept4. The Tattletails are actually kind of cute, in a syrupy kind of way. Although I did scream SHUT UP a few times, I also chuckled when Tattletail's eyes got really wide and he shook with fear when Mama came around.5. A comical story6. It had a FNAF formula, which it improved upon. I don't care for FNAF, but this game was solid.Cons1. Wish it was longer. Even with the bonus material. Hopefully more content will be released, because it really is a good time.2. It made me want to own a Furby.

The game is a nice price of $5.00, which is pretty good for the game. The graphics are amazing for an indie game too! I only have 2 problems with the game. The first was how short the game was, I beat the entire game in about 36 minutes, this includes eggs and all. The other problem was how difficult Mama was to get away from, after I died about 6 times she wasn't scary anymore, she was more of just a problem. I would see the eyes, then I would slowly walk away then BAM! out of no where, Mama just kills me. I guess I just don't see how she works. But I managed to get past her after the second time because she spawned in a different location. But for the price of $5.00, this game did deliver some good scares and some childhood trauma! So I recommend it to anyone who likes horror and Furbys, and anyone who has $5.00 laying around!"

It uses it's atmosphere well I feel, and the audio adds to it without being a series of obnoxious jarring noises (that's a good thing). Well worth the $5 I put into it, and I'd recommend it for anyone looking for an evening to kill."

From the design of the environment, to the story elements, to the sound and music; I praise the developer for doing such a good job. The game runs well even on average computers.I liked the hide and seek aspect with the flashlight in the dark. I liked the sense of urgency to get Tattletail to shut up at critical moments. I liked the house exploration and hidden items to collect.Tattletail now includes a free DLC, lengthening the story, and giving players even more reason to return for a second round. 10/10 satisfied with this product.PS- the price tag is super attractive ."

,Recommended,568090,31311645,Posted: 22 April,all,breanng_03,so tatletail is an okay game it is better than fnaf in my opion it has a lot of myteries and weird thing going on  but the 90's feel and the thing we all want to find out around Chrismas  the furby's  i mean  tattletail  are lovible  and terible like i want to give them a hug or give them to mama  but in hide and seek level could  his need's not be there whwn im hidding  i mean COME ON DO YOU WANT TO BE FEED OR NOT BE CAUGHT BY MAMA but it does have a good consept and the eggs to get the good ending is a good idea  but with all games there are  some bad things  it is not that scary infact you make it not scary at all by just turning off the sound  and the hide and seek level is repetitive and boring . and it's lack of story  makes your poin of going  on and waking  up for tattletail it's like the fnaf games why are you coming back it seams pointless  but i  say give it a try tell me waht you think and i give a 7/10 and look at my undertall review

I think it runs a bit short though, but the twist is fantastic. I would really like a sequal or something like that, maybe from another kids experience withthe tattletail toy, like boogey man and boogey man 2. I would like to see that sequal or another horror game with a different plot, because this team is amazing. I really like your games guys :steamhappy"

76561198142406900,Recommended,568090,29307725,Posted: 16 January,all,Party.Bois,"So and so amount of years ago I picked up one of the FNAF games thinking it was the best thing since Furby's. But whats better than Furby's other than Furby's am I right? TattleTail is a game much like FNAf in the sense that you must survive 5 nights against a monster that jumpscares you (though not with a sound that trashed my turtlebeach headset). Also unlike FNAF you have an ally. Your tattletail friend Cupid (At least that's why I called him). Cupid, while a bit unwelcoming at first, turns into your weapon to defeat the evil Mama. Mama is an evil tattletail who's killed once, and will do it again. But without further delay, lets get on to the pros and cons listPros:Fun gameplayinteresting mechanicschallengingsuspense in the atmospherebest companion a boy or girl or apache attack helicopter could ask forGreat voice actinghistorically accurateGreat consistencymakes me want moreCons:The mama jumpscare could be a bit better lookingno option to turn off lensflare (tanks performance for a low end pc)"
76561198081163365,Recommended,568090,29307877,Posted: 16 January,all,Chinatsu,"Tattletail is a short horror game that is, in my opinion, quite enjoyable despite its simplicity. It takes an absurd concept (like other games in recent memory) and turns it into something terrifying by becoming neither too serious nor too silly. If you're looking for the scariest game of the decade, this game probably isn't what you're looking for. If you're looking for the most mundane horror game available, this game probably isn't what you're looking for. If you're looking for something fun and creepy to play for about an hour, this game might be what you're looking for! The gameplay consists of egg collection, red-light-green-light from hell, pet care simulation, and irresponsible parenting. Merry Christmas!PROS:probably wont give you a heart-attackpolished environments and mechanicsyour little friend is kind of cute actuallyyou get free gifts such as fingernails, hair, etc.environmentally friendly flashlightsCONS:probably wont give you a heart-attackrelatively shortmight curse your computer"

,Recommended,568090,29346011,Posted: 18 January,all,Loyalty,"Although this game is very short, I do feel it is worth the money. Most reviews I see about this game are that it is similar to Five Nights at Freddy's. Let me tell you, it really isn't. FNaF is not scary, nor is its sequels. The fan-games are also not scary. This? This is scary. This game has a very spooky atmosphere, as well as a great style. I'm not going to say this is scary to everyone, but if you hate those Furby things, then uh, this game will probably be for you. The jumpscare is very cheesy though. My favorite thing about this game is that when you're in a situation where you need to concentrate and you're very on edge, you can always count on Tattletail to scare the bujesus out of you when you aren't expecting it....on second thought, that's probably my least favorite part of the game.9/10, play it if you're lookin' for something scary, new, and fun!"

I remember the Furby craze back in 1998 and I even had one. Like the Furby, Tattletail is the thing that doesn't keep quiet which keeps on edge as I try to avoid Mama Tattletail. When the lights go out and that grinding noise starts, I felt that I was about to sweat bullets. I was truly scared. Excellent job."

I, at the time of writing, am at the first death point; when you put Tattletail back in his box in the 3rd chapter.The game itself does a brilliant job at setting the mood, with loud noises, dramatic music, and that atsmopheric background music makes for perfect moments for Mama Tattletail to come jumpscare you.Not sure if theres a pause feature, however.

Next up is ending dependeing on how many eggs you find  will give you your ending, if you don't find all eggs your present will be empty and mama will kill you, but if you find all eggs tattletail will be in the gift snd reward you with a golden flashlight and then you wake your mom up, but for both endings credits will play and you'll unlock the kaleidoscope dlc wit brings us to our next part. next up is dlc the DlC the kaleidescope is basicaly tattle tail has changes from being sneaky to nerdy and 5 days back in time and he is still nerdy so you have no choice to go to the kaleidescope to fix him , after watch in the tape you fix him and then you leave but not before you are beeing hunted down by kaleidoscope momma after nearly escapeinmg you are back in xmas day 1998 to open a sneaky but fixed tattle tail afterresponding to a knock knock me joke tattle tail says what i think is the best Dlc ending on a happy side  because he says ""me love you *giggles*"" and the DLC ends with the creditsSo that is the end of the review and I will see you at the end of the portal.Thank you for reading this erichment center review activity goodbye *Tattletail giggle*"
