,Recommended,568320,31449972,Posted: 29 April,all,Cakoka,"Like mentioned a lot before: This game is highly addictive! The puzzles are so much fun. I used to make a lot of nonograms in my childhood and always loved them. So this nice little game caught my attention.The puzzles have sizes as small as 5x5 to the largest size of 25x25 which sounded rather small to me at first but it isn't a bother at all. The puzzles are charming, relaxing to solve with still quite some difficulty as you progress.It has an active workshop as well where people can create and share their own nonograms for others to be solved. So when you finish the game, there are still lots of great puzzles available.Overall; Worth the money. You wont get bored easily."

As described, every puzzle is solvable without any guessing, with some of the boards being quite tricky to figure out (e.g. figuring out known X's and using them to extend progress).  Very nice pictures when solving.  Good use of a very nostalgic concept on one specific puzzle.Also like how the creators are very responsive to suggestions by various players."

Great controls, lots of puzzles, and in this case, future workshop support. Even if the price was thrice as high, I'd still probably reccomend it to anyone who, like me, love picross puzzles."

,Recommended,568320,29191306,Posted: 11 January,all,Irimid,"Really fun and simple picross game, I've played a few and it seems like it's not hard to make one but it's clearly hard to clean up the controls and UI, this game manages to do both.The only thing I'd complain about is that some of the larger puzzles get a bit small so it can cause some eye strain (for me) but it's not a huge issue.The game has just been released with future updates coming in the way of a workshop for levels and possible modes ? So I wouldn't be suprised to see some other tweaks here and there! Dev is clearly listening :)"
,Recommended,568320,29040164,Posted: 5 January,all,🐧 crow,"it's picross. it works well and there's big puzzles and small puzzles and also some medium puzzles. problems: the UI is perhaps TOO minimalist, in that the big puzzles can get too small on the screen and there's no way to zoom in or adjust your control to deal with it. combine that with the fact that you can easily move your mouse off the row and thus make errors and it's a recipe for frustration. this is a definite issue because most pc picross games don't bother with the big grids, and it should be a selling point here. maybe with some fixes to the control scheme pictopix can be an excellent product; until then, it's a flawed product but perhaps still worth buying.edit: it turns out you CAN fix these problems, though maybe a note of what the options in the options menu actually do would help"
,Recommended,568320,31073945,Posted: 11 April,all,herrwilding,"Remember Picross on the DS? Like many great puzzle games, it was based on a simple, but smart idea that created highly addictive gameplay... and its pixel-style is so very appealing if like me you grew up with classic videogames. Well, guess what? As I found out yesterday, you now you can relive all the glory of Picross on PC! Installed it last night at 11:30pm to take a quick look and (somewhat predictably) fell into bed exhausted at 1:20am. Each image only takes 1-5 minutes to solve (at least in the early 10x10 stages), but... you know. Just one more pic. And one more. And...A typical case of ""easy to learn, hard to master"" I'm sure this one will keep me awake for many more nights!"

The picross aren't too difficult so far (almost done all 15x15)The only down point so far, is the fact that pictures aren't really original (a boomerang etc) Maybe it will get better on the bigger grid.There's the workshop as well but i haven't tried this feature yet.Overall a great picross games for beginners and veterans.I will definitely try to get all stars on this one."

,Recommended,568320,34067595,Posted: 6 August,all,Misora,"I've been following this game before it was even greenlit. I have played many piccross games before, so I was quite excited with it's release! The gameplay is pretty simple to follow, so those of you new to piccross games will have no issues. The puzzles themselves are very well thought out. I enjoyed playing all of them, especially the secret bonus levels that you can unlock at the end (if you figure out how.) The gameplay music is rather nice, so it makes gameplay relaxing. I wish there were more tracks available, but if you become bored with it, the option to mute the music is available.The best thing I love about this game is the option to create your own puzzles as well as be able to play puzzles other users have created. This literally opens up endless gameplay. I have a great time seeing what other players can create!The only thing I would love to see different is bigger puzzles. While 25x25 can be challenging, I really love challenges, so the 25s where not as much of a challenge as I'd hope for. I'd love to see 30, 40, or even 50x size puzzles in the future!Overall, I'd give this a 4.5 out of 5 stars."

I have already gotten many hours of use from the game. It is worth every cent."
,Recommended,568320,29656684,Posted: 2 February,all,apocalyptech,"(My play time is rather long due to accidentally leaving the thing running in the background overnight a few times)Pictopix is another great addition to the nonogram/picross type puzzle game genre.  Nothing too crazy or surprising in this one!  The puzzles are quite enjoyable, and can all be solved without resorting to proof-by-contradiction.  There's a handy ""mark"" feature available with the middle mouse button which can aid in counting out squares, and there's a superb feature called ""smart slide"" which restricts click-and-drag marking to a single row/column, which is quite handy for not accidentally making marks you hadn't intended.  All nonogram puzzle games should include that feature!The in-game puzzle editor works great, and the workshop/community integration lets you upload your own puzzles, and play other users' puzzles, if you're so inclined.  Works great on Linux as well!  The game is well worth the money if you enjoy this kind of puzzle.There are two minor things I don't like about it, neither of which should discourage anyone from checking it out, but I'll mention 'em for posterity:1) You get ""crown"" ratings for each puzzle based on some criteria (mostly to do with what ""hints"" you have enabled in the options), but the third crown can be missed if you accidentally misclick too often (which would require re-playing the puzzle if you want the third crown).  The threshhold for losing the third crown has been increased quite a bit in the most recent version (to the point where I never ran into the problem again after the patch), but it still feels wrong to punish misclicks in a puzzle like this, especially if you're able to recover from them and solve the puzzle anyway!2) It's a common convenience in computer nonogram puzzles to mark rows/columns as ""complete"" once there's an appropriate sequence of marks on the row/col (regardless of whether it's correct or not).  Pictopix considers that a ""hint,"" though, and you'll be unable to get all three crowns if you have this enabled.  In practice I didn't miss it too much, but it's something I always appreciate in other nonogram games.Still, those are quite minor, and the game's quite enjoyable.  I'd definitely recommend it!"

It's a great puzzle game and it can become quite addictive.It will ruin your sleep-cycle, by ""completing just one more"".The only downside that I can think of is that some of the puzzles have really bright backgrounds, which can be distracting whilst trying to solve, but this has only happened to me once or twice."

76561198059578520,Recommended,568320,33657078,Posted: 19 July,all,Nubcakes,"Let me just start off by saying, I've been fond of picross puzzles for a long time when I'm not sure what I'm in the mood for. This game is perfect for that. And unlike the app games that I find mostly, this doesn't have that high difficulty curve when it gets to 15x15 puzzles. I'm able to solve the 15x15 puzzles fairly easily. It's not a game I play a lot, but when I'm in a rut of boredom and not sure what to do, this is good for that. And some of the puzzles give me other ideas for games to play, it's totally worth it for it's price. I got it at a reduced price due to chrono, but I think it's totally worth it regardless.Going on, I've seen some complaints by people, confused about the rating system. It's not broken, as some claim it is, it just judges you based on mistakes and corrections AS WELL AS time. I have never had any problem with getting three stars on all the levels. In fact it's much more likely that I'll think I've gotten two stars after a puzzle and then find out I got three somehow, and that feels good.I think one of the only complaints I can really offer is the music could be better, but honestly most of the time I don't listen to it anyway, I listen to my own music on Pandora or Spotify (I use both) and just play."

It's cheap, has a very smooth appearance and has some nice, soothing background music while you're thinking. It can easily keep you entertained for several hours. (In total, without hints, it took me about 20 hours to complete all puzzles.)And if you're looking for similar games: hexcells and squarecells are very similar, with a slick appearance, relaxing background music and puzzles to test your brain. I would also recommend those to anyone interested in this game."
,Recommended,568320,29831522,Posted: 10 February,all,Bertrand de Blanchefort,"Quite a few years ago there was a game called ""Armor Picross 2"". Really slick lay-out, simple, relaxing, basically the perfect puzzle game to me. Always came back to that year after year on Newgrounds, wishing the guy would just put out an Armor Picross 3 or a level pack.This game scratches that itch for me. It's fun, easy to pick up and the coloured ""pictures"" you get at the end are pretty satisfying.My only two complaints I'd have is that the game doesn't tell you when you're wrong; it lets you make mistakes which can sometimes put you 10 minutes further into a puzzle without realizing you have to do it all over again to ""3 crown"" it. My other complaint is that the game doesn't automatically grey out the numbers when you complete a row or column without rendering it unable for you to get 3 crowns. It's really just a QoL improvement to me and not a big issue (more personal preference), so it doesn't really interfere with my enjoyment, but I would like it better that way.Either way, worth the price, pick it up!"

I beat every level and without fail, X'ing off a row of 0's would skip over a few boxes (or marking a full row would skip some).- Nearly impossible to 3-star levels. You only get to make a few errors. In a game reliant on a mouse, you make errors.- It doesn't show when you finish a clue so the game is 90% counting to make sure you filled it in correctly.-The numbers don't show when you've solved it (unless you play on an easier difficulty in which case you can't get the stars either)- If you DO play on a lower difficulty in order to see when you finish a line, you need to mark off both sides of the clue for it to register.PRO:- Steam workshop, so if you decide you do like this game, there's hundreds of additional puzzles to play.- I'm done with it and can finally uninstall it.
