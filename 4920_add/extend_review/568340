I don't see often games so cheap with such a great outcome of the game.The story hit me a little at the end, it's a bit heartbreaking to see a father do such thing to his own daughter. I don't really want to spoil about what happened, you should experience it yourself. c:I wish that the story could be a little more detailed, making the game a little longer. However, it did surprise me about the ending.Anyways, worth the time, which it takes around 30minutes to complete the game. The price is really cheap, as I said and, the Screenshots came out really beautiful. ♥"

It took me about 30-ish minutes to complete it.Personally the length didn't bother me at all because right from the get go you are drawn into the world of ""Behind The Memory"". The game has a very rich and deep story that made it all worth it, Graphics that make you go ""wow"" at certain places and gameplay that is very straightforward and smooth for a Walking Simulator.However there is some minor issues i encountered during my experience with ""Behind The Memory"".1.  At certain places in the game there is so much screen tearing.2. Some textures at certain places doesnt fully load in (Mostly during the ""cut scene"" with the thugs and Hector's daughter Emma)This is just some minor issues and didn't ruin the overall experience for me. Hopefully this will all be fixed in upcoming patches!So for me the final score will be a strong 8/10"
,Not Recommended,568340,31735922,Posted: 13 May,all,B00!,"It's a short walking simulator with predictable story which ends within 40 mins.Do not buy.Technical1. It runs quite smoothly and has no fps drops or crashes. It runs quite well.2. The game doesn't support controller fully. Meaning you can look, move & interact with the world but if u go to pause menu you are forced to use mouse to click on resume option. You can't use controller in main menu too. Also in game if you interact with readable object (eg letter, notes etc.) you have to use mouse just to click 'resume' button to get back into game. It’s extremely annoying.3. The options menu is a joke; it looks like a mobile port and bad one at that. There are literally 6 options available.You cannot go beyond your screen resolution. No AA, no audio controls, No control remapping, nothing. It’s like a mobile port.3. The game on surface looks good. But once you start playing it, it falls apart. The textures do not look that great. There are scratches on each and every object just to give it old and rusty look, it looks really weird. For example, glass doors of stores will have broken glass and broken handles, not scratched metal borders, grass cant ♥♥♥♥ing grow on concrete road, the road should be cracked or broken for grass to grow from the cracks and broken parts.  Little things like these pull you out of the experience4. Textures sometimes take time to load in a cutscene and that looks odd.GAMEPLAY/STORY1. it’s a walking simulator, so there isn’t much to talk about. You can walk, look & interact that’s it. You can also see which objects you can interact by using button.2. Walking is pathetically slow. You must press the run button in order to play game at reasonable speed.3. The game can be categorized in walking simulator. In such games, you should either have good story or really beautiful world to explore. This game has neither of those.4. The voice acting is decent. Even though Sometimes it sounds like a guy reading lines form a script (this rarely happens so most of the time the voice acting is good.)Dialogues are sometimes cringeworthy (this too is rare)5. Story is extremely predictable. It looks like the end was meant to be shocking and heartbreaking, IT ISN'T. It’s boring and stupid.6.The story takes place in post apocalyptic world where some kind of virus has spread which kills people. Society has gone downhill and everything is destroyed. You play as a man who is travelling to his house. He had issues with his daughter. Now the daughter is dead and how and why she is dead is told at very end. He has some dark past that relates to her death which we(player) do not know. The whole game builds up on this “Dirty secret” of our character7. Entire story is highly predictable, uninteresting and boring.ConclusionAll in all it looks like a project of a student rather than a game.Bad options menu, predictable and boring storyline, half♥♥♥♥♥controller support, no buttons remapping, etc makes me say the game is not worth buying."

Voice acting was mostly very good, except parts from the daughter. The story is very interesting, the ending is shocking and a bit controversal, i liked it. Playtime is short, around an hour if you dont run through the game. I absolutely recommend it."
76561198134352341,Recommended,568340,30290062,Posted: 2 March,all,flecka,For a game that only cost a few dollars I can say it is well worth it.I give it 4 stars out of 5 for the graphics and a 4 star out of 5 for good unique story. The achievments was easy to get which is good for those who like to get perfect games on there accounts. Only 3 achievments would take a little work. One of them you got to look everywhere for and the other two you have to replay two chapters over to get it. Has two diffrent endings you can choose. which is cool for those who want to replay it again to see the diffrent ending of a story. Only thing was a little downfall is I wish it was a longer story but then again the game was only a few dollars. So over all I would recommend this game.

I personally decided not to refund, as I knew it was cheaper than most and taking a chance and is better than some in the same ""genre"" that I've been dissapointed with. I will say you will finish the game quite fast and can make your own decision of worthiness quite easily. It either is, or not, simple as that. Just don't expect your going to get a longer type game, it is nothing like Firewatch, Life is Strange, or any of those games, it is it's own short story, love it or hate it. Look at my gametime, that's full, total, hope this helps.5/10*Note*I chose to recommend as it is not a ""bad"" game, it's up to the individual, and I recommend onthe basis that you CAN finish the game within refund zone, and decide for oneself, soo there it is..."

Because maybe it's just not my taste, but it might be yours. You play a post-apocalyptic man in search of a memory. It's a very short, walking/exploration game. But since the main point of Behind the Memory is the story itself, I have to go thumbs down.The graphics are very good...they remind me a little of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. However, I found  the first person character you're playing to be annoying and a jerk. That could be interesting in itself and I like a good story or plot in games. I suspect, however, this story was written by a very young person, because frankly, the plot didn't make much sense; I didn't find the ending believable.After the answers are revealed, it lets you play out two different epilogues. There's no replayability."
76561198025025928,Recommended,568340,29218058,Posted: 12 January,all,j.w.yergan,"Behind the Memory is a really impressive and surprisingly dark first person adventure game. I've always been a fan of the Unreal Engine and it makes this game perfectly stunning and ominous when the story demands such precise atmospheres. I really enjoyed the story, finding the narrative one that mixes natural tendencies in both thought and action, no matter how unfortunate the may be, with a sudden shift in reality and priority. Not once in this aspects does the game shirk away from making the player truly unsettled in the consequences that follow.I wish I could write more, but I feel it may deprive you of the honest experience this game gives. It's gripping and harsh, there's a solidarity to it felt all the way from the brilliant start to the intense ending. If you enjoy solid narratives, play Behind the Memory. I hope you appreciate the work as much as I did."

,Not Recommended,568340,32276111,Posted: 8 June,all,Zockerx96,"I exptected more. The story is not reliable, the game takes place almost at a single location and the performance could be a lot better. It's not bad, but not good either."
76561197971341065,Recommended,568340,30294892,Posted: 3 March,all,sfnhltb,"A really nice looking game, very short but with a nice atmosphere which varies well to fit the progression of the story, but let down a bit by the perspective of looking back at memories, where your character has been put in very difficult or impossible situations and made the worst/weakest choice each time. So we are left slowly recovering/retreading the events of the past, getting darker and darker - let's put it this way - almost all of humanity has been wiped out by an epidemic and that isn't really anything more than a MacGuffin to let the plot play out compared to the events that follow.A particular problem with the plot is the most troubling decision our protagonist made in the past isn't even touched upon - we know the final act he did in the whole sorry episode (chronologically speaking, we learn a couple of scenes earlier what he did), but there is no elucidation of why or how events of that final confrontation transpired.Overall it is interesting and atmospheric, if uneven in execution, and covers some very dark material that may be distressing to some,"
,Not Recommended,568340,33799076,Posted: 25 July,all,MysticalCatButt,Beautiful cinematics and good story concept. Unfortuately the game is very boring and short. The voice acting is cringeworthy. Save your time and money.
,Not Recommended,568340,32016679,Posted: 28 May,all,markzwaan,"This feels like a student project, something a talented sixteen year old might make and show to his friends. While it looks nice on the surface, once you start playing it the first thing you'll notice is screen tearing, massive screen tearing. I don't have the fastest gaming rig, but with 16Gb of memory and a GTX 980 I can run games like Doom at ultra settings, 60 fps and no screen tearing. The story is okay, but very predictable. The tone is all over the place. The father goes from caring to psychopath in just seconds which makes the conclusion half hearted. And what sixteen year old girl would shout at her dad: ""You can't tell me what to do, you're not myboyfriend!""? Yet that is exactly what she does, it doesn't make much sense. For a little while I thought the father might have had an ""unhealthy relationship"" with his daughter (especially since he mentions that his wife is dead). But it turns out that this is not the case.The game is short, it took me less than an hour to finish and get all achievements. There is not a lot of story in the game and like I mentioned it's not very coherent. For instance in the beginning of the game the main character fondly remembers going to a cabin in the woods with his neighbours (though at first I thought Christian was his son, since you don't find out what their relation is until a later scene) and that nobody wanted to leave. Only to hear him say that he never liked them in the first place less than five minutes later. The voice acting is poor and clearly done by non English speakers trying to sound American. The characters in the cut scenes barely move and when they do they look like manequins. The developer clearly took effort to make the game look nice and it doesn't look like a cheap asset flip or a quick money grab. But the lack of proper set-up and the uneven story makes it hard to get emotionally involved. The writer obviously tries to paint the father as a horrible person while at the same time trying to make him sympathetic enough for the player to identify himself with him. That might have worked if we had spent more time with this character and if he didn't go from likeable to cruel in a matter of seconds. A game like ""The Last of Us"" uses a similar set up and in that game it works, because we get to spent a lot of time playing as the main character, working up a bond with the girl we've rescued and protecting her. In this game it just feels off. In order for the final choice to have the right emotional impact, we have to either actually care for the main character or really hate him. But with the minimal story and sloppy set up I just can't."

Once I pause, the only way out is to alt-tab to task manager and exit the program. And since the same structure is used for 'reading' I get stuck in the third zone and can't finish the game.My guess is that the game isn't designed for a machine using multiple monitors? Unfortunately it isn't compelling enough to make crawling behind the desk and unplugging things worth while to check.I don't see this warning anywhere in the discussion or other reviews so here it is: WARNING. Game MIGHT get irretrievably stuck if you play it on a machine with more than one monitor."

I wished the rather short story had taken another ending. It seems as if the game´s concept was designed for a 5-10 times longer gameplay. And because the programmers did not have more time or money for the development the end came very abrupt and unexpected. I was really sad about what happened to the girl. I wished I did not see the end and the unacceptable behaviour of the father!I recommend the game but there could have been much much more potential. What a pity!"
