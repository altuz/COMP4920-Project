,Recommended,568580,29755488,Posted: 6 February,all,Skid Row Trash,"I tried this when it first appeared on Steam last month but had to go through the website and then again the other day.While it definitely has issues and feels fairly cheap, I find this game absolutely hilarious. Watching these ships peel around on the water like speedboats and firing torpedoes at laser speed I can't stop laughing when playing.I've played World of Warships, Steel Ocean, and even as ships in War Thunder (They had pirate galleons last april fools for 3 days) and while this is not the same quality, this is different because it has a more arcade feel.I'd love to see this game go in a crazy over-the-top arcade style rather than another realistic generic warships game as there are already quite a few of those. Subs are cool though, that's always awesome.I'm going to keep my eye on this one and play it here and there."
,Recommended,568580,29871851,Posted: 12 February,all,Durt,"As Phlydaily said,it has been a long time since we had a good game with submarines.I think that this game has lot of potential,but also a lot of laws.Here are some of the flaws:1.Unbalanced.Why is it,that the russian tier 2 G5 is so op?And,also Japaneese submarines.They are way better than others.2.Physics.If two ships ram eachother,one of them shouldn't fly 10 meters into the sky and the other one shouldn't sink to the bottom3.Connection.If you leave the training just as you get connecte to a game,your connection will crash.Quick restart of the game fixes this issue4.Weird torpedo spawns.On my Krabbe,which has one torpedo tube in the middle,a torpedo spawned on the left.And,some submarines can hug the enemy and the torp will hit,while others must be at least 50 meters away,or the torpedo will just bounce off the ship (saw a torpedo bounce off a ship and fly 80 meters into the sky before falling down.5.Some models.For example,on the tier 2 or maybe tier 3 american ship,the guns in the glass domes on the top don't turn6.Glitched damage counter.You know how when you damage an enemy,bunch of numbers shows up telling you how much damage have you dealt?Well,when I'm sailing somewhere,and my team is fighting far away from me,1 out of 3 numbers don't show up above the damaged ship,but rather somewhere totally randomly on the map.7.Amount of xp needed for the heavy ships.18 000 XP?!Really?Didn't you add one too many zero's?8.Weird prices.Price of a Biber?180 000 or something.Price of a new engine?150 000.I don't think that's how it works irl."
,Recommended,568580,29767905,Posted: 7 February,all,Kodyd194,"Early Access ship based shooter, with a questionable cash shop. Very rough but that is GunFleet in a nutshell. I have seen a lot of comparisons to World of Warships, but I have not  spent enough time with World of Warships to really compare the two. I can say however that the game feels like poor mans world of tanks, on the ocean.  Its neat I wouldn't say its good but I can definitely see it having a niche audience that enjoys it."
76561198015671863,Not Recommended,568580,29759220,Posted: 7 February,all,Curst,"Here's how this compares to World of Warships (since War Thunder fleet is not out yet):1. Ships appear to be moving faster in relation to map size.But that's mostly because maps are tiny here. If you take that out, the ships don't feel much faster, especially not the heavy boats which feel clumsier than battleships in WoWS. On top of that there's no cruise-control, so you have to keep pressing W in order to move forward at half speed and Space+W to move at full speed.2. You have to zero in to improve accuracy.This feature feels very much out of place considering they're aiming for a faster pace gameplay. If you move - you lose accuracy, if you turn the gun - you lose accuracy. On top of that guns turn speed feels off in some cases (7.62mm machine gun turning like a 127mm turret on a destroyer).3. Physics... So primitive it's barely there.Boats feel like reskinned tanks. Very high friction and/or low inertia. This makes boats feel like they're moving on rails. On the other hand with some practice boats can turn in one spot (once I saw a heavy boat rotating like a fan to dodge torpedoes). Collision looks slightly weird but overall it's passable I suppose.4. Graphics. Not just bad, but somehow offensive.I don't care if a game has bad graphics, but this game isn't just NOT visually pleasing. Its core graphical features (textures,  3d models) are pretty bad, but the devs are using some cheap effects to try and make it look fancy. Looks like heavy makeup on a rotting corpse.5. Optimization.Hard to tell. For me the game runs smoothly, but that doesn't tell much since my PC is several times better than what's listed as recommended system requirements. However, the requirements are very low so I'm guessing this game can run on much older machines than WoWS.6. There are submarines though.They don't really add much other than frustration (for non-subs AND other subs alike) unfortunately. Just like with any other online game that has submarines.7. Microtransactions.I won't even touch that subject. The term ""pay to win"" lost all its meaning nowadays. You either can deal with microtransactions or you can't.8. Miscellaneous.- You can only use one gun at a time (having more guns doesn't increase your firepower, especially not with automatic guns);- You can't do controlled bursts or single fire with automatic guns, they fire a predetermined number of rounds per burst;- Engine overheats if you go at full speed for too long;- Sound quality is modest at best;- Overall amount of content is modest at best;- Overall level of polish is modest at best;- Playerbase is extremely small at the moment (and for a good reason) with peak online around 400 players (~70% of them are non-Steam Russians, take from that what you will);- Battles are small scale, the largest I've seen is 6vs6 (maybe that's due to low playerbase);- Fake/biased positive reviews and downvoted negative reviews;- Having to hold W+Space to go at full speed is maddening;- Even Steel Ocean was/is better than this, at least it has more content and players."

As your cannon's shells bounce off enemy armour with a taunting ""No penetration"" report.Party! As you grind away, trying to get those precious vessel-upgrading research points, which after a few levels become harder and harder to get if you're not handing over money.You're also at a disadvantage if you don't understand Russian, since that seems to be the dominant tongue in in-game chat."
,Recommended,568580,29742500,Posted: 6 February,all,Tomwazere,"This is a first impression review,It plays a lot like World of Warships, I'd go so far as to say it is almost a clone of it, I'd describe it as a more arcade like version of it, like how COD is to BF.It's a lot easier to get on with at first glance than World Of Warships but very little sets it apart. You can play as a submarine and you are able to change ship colours etc but that is limited and would require a great deal of play to unlock the credits neccessary to do so. You can pay real money for various ships and pay for credits to unlock camo's and the like faster which is where the developers make their money. The ship balancing is a bit iffy though, with early submarines playing a lot better than their ship 'equals'.I'd recomend it as it is free and works well, I killed a few hours with it. If you were looking for a fast pace arcade ship battling game then you can't go wrong with this, however, it is very repetative and does not have many of it's own features to make it stand out from other similar games. 5/7.Edit:Since playing I have created a quick video to help those stuck on the fence deciding to download it or not. The video shows the game's tutorial, main menu's (Aprox 2 mins in) and customisation options as well as one quick game.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I0jAhaMYkE"

,Recommended,568580,29913189,Posted: 13 February,all,StevoMission,Good game. It gets a bad rap for trying to copy games like world of war ships. but really the only similarities are in the lobby/port. the game mechanics are inovative and pretty solid with few glitches or faults.

Played for a while before it came upon steam, and would have a lot more playtime if my computer didnt have a hard time running any game. People complain about the games graphics, but If you play games for the graphics, then why are you playing games when you could look at some art of movies. Its a great game."

None of the ships/boats are accurate, very tough interface to deal with. If this game does get any better, let me know and maybe I'll try and play again. But this game is, unfortunately, a flop. Unless you like bad games, then go for it."
,Not Recommended,568580,29741770,Posted: 6 February,all,RAC Warrior,"Very early into ""early access"". Visuals aren't very appealing. The HUD and menu are just bad. It's very arcade-ish. Basically WoT with ships. Has the same stupid mechanic where enemies dissapear right in fron of your eyes just because they aren't ""spotted"" anymore. Which is just frustrating. People basically just try to get close to you fast and launch torpedo at point blank range. Almost only russians on there."

If you are looking for big ships like World of Warships and Steel Ocean, you are at the wrong place.There are 4 vessel classes in the game: light attack crafts, medium attack crafts, heavy gunboats and submarines. Soviets and Germans have all of them. Americans have only medium attack line and Japan only has Submarine lineGame also has connection problems. Most of the time I wasn't able to play because of lagBut remember that this is an early access game. It may have a potential. If you are a naval combat fan you can try."
76561198098400273,Not Recommended,568580,29843673,Posted: 11 February,all,Mikitarug,"Edit: This game appears to be one of those moneyearning schemes so play at your own riskWhile this game is still in early stages of development I think that it has a lot of potential and it is fun even now. If I looked at the current steam reviews before playing it I wouldn't have given it a chance which I find kind of regrettable. Sure the game has a lot of flaws but if you compare it to let's say Steel Ocean I think it's better.Pros:- Quick paced short matches- Submarines and ASW- My low-end notebook can run it no problem- Something different from WOWs or Steel ocean- ""hidden features"" like compartment flooding or convoy map mode- Derpy physicsCons:- Just about 50 ships and the xp requied to get to tier 5 is scaled (meaning slow progression)- Few people playng it (although after the steam launch it's not so bad)- Unbalanced a lot (you can see the devs are trying from the patch notes tho)- Devs probably don't know how to make toggle buttons work- Takes few games to get used to the style of the game- Unbalanced pay to win items (not so bad since few peaople use them imo)- It might die in the next few monthsPs: I have non Steam account with about 160 matches played"
