,Not Recommended,568810,30160786,Posted: 25 February,all,Bilbo Baggins,"Yesterday I would have said that this is a great game, it has great direction and potential, but now I see that the developers are pretty much the same masterminds behind their previous Freestyle game.  And when I say masterminds I mean they charge 30 dollars for a character - which has significant stat advantages and is unobtainable without paying.Pros:+Character Customization+Decent Community+Skill Intensive+Can't Gain Significant Edge Through PayingCons:-50%+ of Content Microtransactions-F2P Content Is Lame(for the most part your character won't look unique unless you drop 40$+ on the game)-Goalies are AI and inconsistent at that.  Literally have watched a 3 point lead blown because the goalie stared at the ball.-80% of the community doesn't pass the ball-90% of Defenders don't know how to tackle-Everyone Plays Striker, No one is good at it-Developers Change Event Rewards at will-Overwhelming number of South American players.  No South American Server(which is in high demand and sure to come).-Game existed 2 years ago and eventually went under.A little extra on that last Con, and which was ultimately the last straw for me and this game.  Yesterday you were able to obtain E-Coins which are temporary versions of the irl currency alot of the microtransactions of the game go on.  Yesterday there was also several oppurtunities to unlock the 30$ characters - which was exclusive through a temporary two month long event.  However without any news, warning, or statement whatsoever the game decided to change the first 5 game of the day reward from 150 e-coins to a 1000 points(which to put into perspective is about two games, or 12 minutes) - Basically locking over 50% of the content in the game from the free to play community.  Overall I think the level 48 reward that existed(and was also changed) which gave the player 3000 e-coins(30$) was overwhelming, and they have pushed it to a level 56 reward to unlock 1000 e-coins, which is essentially a single premium stat item.Ultimately it is a free to play game and developers have the right to charge whatever they want for whatever they deem should become a microtransaction and I respect that.  Overall the game doesn't punish the f2p players, seeing as every stat-based item has a free equivilent, however there is little incentive in the game to work towards.  If you don't want to drop 20 dollars in the game the max you will be able to do is kick a curve ball and have an afro - maybe eventually having a shirt if you decide to drop 30+ hours into the game to get a level 56 character.  However even then small portion of content will be unavailable because e-coins dissappear after seven days meaning to unlock a free character you'd need to get 3 characters to level 56 within a 7 day period.(like storing 3 of them at level 55 and getting that last level for all of them at once) - but seeing as they have already done random changes to the game to prevent players from getting free characters, it wouldn't surprise me if they decide to change the game again upon reading my review.   Ultimately if you're looking for a game to play with a few friends and kill a few minutes out of your day, this is your stop.  If you are looking for a game to actually pour some time into I'd recommend spending money on a different game up front.I'd give the game a 6/10.  If they add a SA server and make goalies slightly customizable so as to be more consistent, less luck based, and not completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times - the game would be an 8/10.  If they hadn't of screwed over the event-rewards and proved themselves to have a disconnect with the community, the game would be an 8/10.  If both of those existed, the game would be 10/10 perfect - seeing as all content would be unlockable, the playerbase would be consistent with its locaton(meaning less lag in matches), and goalies would be consistent so as not to tip games in the favor of whichever sides goalie isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(because nothinig says victory like your goalie catching uncatchable balls but the enemies goalie literally ducking to avoid the ball).Final Score: 6/10Developer Score: 3/10Would I play this game: With FriendsWould I pay in this game: NoEsport Capability: Not LikelyAudio: 8/10(Audio Queues are Useful)Gameplay: 5/10(Goalie AI sucks, Lag)Graphics: 7/10(Cartoony Art Style)Music: 8/10(Tight Soundtrack - Probably best part about the game is the rap soundtrack)Replay Value: 4/10(No Incentive for F2P players; Pay to look cool, not play to look cool.)"

,Recommended,568810,30237288,Posted: 28 February,all,~ Jos ~,"Nice game has a lot of potential, good mechanics like it's brother freestyle basketball.Too bad not there's not enough attention from the developers, no regular bug fixes and support.Getting more P2W heavy, although skill is still more important.Sad that every 'freestyle' game goes the same path, while they all have huge potential."
,Not Recommended,568810,30200545,Posted: 26 February,all,Devi,"TL;DR - The game could be very good if servers and goalkeeper AI are improved, but the devs seem to be in it for the money rather than enjoyment.Okay, where to begin. I feel as if I'm mostly going to be recapping a lot of the issues already raised, but I feel like the more people speak out about this the more likely the devs are to respond.The base gameplay (not taking into consideraton the connection issues and terrible goalie AI) is actually really enjoyable and the music in the game is really high quality, but the business model and deceptive tactics of the devs is incredibly shady, downright deplorable and ultimately means that I would not recommend this game.As others have stated there is currently an event to commemorate the launch of the game, wherein originally the reward for reaching level 48 was 3000 E-coins (coins which are the event equivalent of the premium currency) which was basically $30 worth of free coins. This could be seen to be overkill, and it seems as if the devs thought this too.DURING THE EVENT, and I'm not making this up, AFTER THE EVENT STARTED they changed the rewards so that now the E-Coin reward is at level 56, and only provides 1000 coins. Not only this but they also changed the rewards so that players now do not get a free DLC character, but rather a ""capsule"" (a gacha/luck system) with a chance to win one of the characters.THIS IS NOT OK. Whoever thought this would be a good idea is seriously misguided, and really makes me question the intentions of the devs. Now some players have received 3000 free coins and a free DLC characters while others are stuck with only 1000 coins (which equates to just over one permanent cosmetic item) if they make it to level 56.To add insult to injury the daily reward system which had previously provided 50 E-Coins for completing 5 games a day has also now been changed to provide only 1000 points. These points are obtained from playing the game, and 1000 points is a very meagre amount.I understand completely that they probably thought 3000 coins on top of the EXP boosts was a bit overkill (which it probably was) but to change the event mid-way through shows that they don't consider the playerbase as much as they do their own profit.If they want to maintain their reputation they should either change back the rewards to how they were and compensate players to make up for what they lost or provide some kind of compensation after the event has ended as an apology (and I don't mean points, which is what I expect they would probably do). Currently all of the permanent cosmetics are locked behind a paywall, something which leaves a very sour taste in my mouth.I will say, however, that I still intend to play simply because of the club community. This is the only reason while I plan on continuing to play; being part of a club is essentially the same as a guild, and I've met a lot of friends on this game in such a short time.Also the league matches that come with being part of a club fix some of the complaints about lack of teamwork.If the Devs rectify their actions (and fix Goalkeeper AI/servers by creating a seperate Brazilian server) I may edit this review to recommend it but as of right now I would say that it's only worth playing for the clubs."

76561198048013364,Not Recommended,568810,30156504,Posted: 24 February,all,StopMeNevuh,"EDIT: I no longer recommend this game. Recently, they decided to cancel the event that was finally bringing back old players. Their reason for cancelling it was that they found an error that could affect gameplay, however, all the players know it was only because the develoeprs realized people were farming ecoins and other items that would otherwise cost a considerable amount of real money to obtain instantly. This game is pay to win and the developers are very greedy. Nothing has also been improved with the actual gameplay since launch. All they have done was add more ways for them to get money from players. Another game that could've had more potential but the developers care more about money. To top it off, the game is losing players steadily. Might as well stick to FIFA.Original Review:This is a really fun game that can get you hooked if you're a football/soccer fan. I believe I saw Freestyle Football years ago but I never tried it at the time because I didn't have a pc suitable for gaming. Now, I finally do so I downloaded it as soon as I saw it. I played for hours straight! At first, you don't have flashy moves when you're trying to get through opponents but that builds up through progression. As you level up, you gain access to skills that you can purchase and add on to your character. However, there is a limit to how many skills you can add and the only way to unlock skill slots is through real money. This isn't bad because you can still be a good player if you manage your skills well. Unfortunately, there are items in-game that you can buy with real money and improve your character, but don't let that deter you from playing this game because it's quite easy to buy the items by just playing normally. There's no advantage between in-game currency items vs real money items, except for the permaneent duration option. Yes that's right, with in-game currency you can only own an item for a max period of 30days, but you can choose to buy an item with real money and keep it forever.I know the game just recently came out again and it's not like the developer is a giant, so I was not expecting a clean game. There are bugs, unpolished music and server issues but I have big hopes for the game. I hope the developers work out the issues since I really found the game to be a blast. It's an excellent free to play game for any football/soccer fans out there!"

,Recommended,568810,30230732,Posted: 27 February,all,GeneralTso,"Pretty good game, but a bit too many in game purchases. Joycity fixed many of the problems that I wish they had fixed in freestyle2 street basketball, such as poor client, friends list mayhem, and lag/central servers for the most part, and have really polished their launcher and have cut down on bloat. The game runs much more smoothly than it's predecessor.The training system seems kind of odd, and currency is a bit hard to come by after spending all of it on training points. It is regrettable that without an attribute system, my character cannot specialize in ""run speed,"" but this new system alleviates the pay to win aspect of freestyle 2 street basketball.Only issue I have is that all cosmetic items seem to be 12 day temporary, even upon spending real money. They will likely change this in the future.Special Characters seem to be easier to come by, but this may be because of the early launch of this game."

There aren't many out there and there aren't any free to play soccer games, Fifa world was a good one.+ Multiple servers depending on where you are from. Everything isn't forced onto one server+ CustomizationCONS:- The community can be kind of toxic at times- Matches can be hard to find depending on what position you select.- There are a bunch of brazilians on the North American server. Another server is need for these players. They are only playing with same language speakers.- The game crashes from time to time, especially if the f9 hotkey is pressed. P.S. I use f9 to record.- There aren't a lot of players.- There can be a learning curve for players who do not understand soccer/futbol.- There are people who like to shoot and not pass.Overall, this is an awesome game that I hope more people find out about. This game shut down prematurely because it was in the shadow of Freestyle Street Basketball. Hopefully, Steam helps the growth of the game because there aren't any enjoyable free to play soccer games. Fifa and Pes are best bets for soccer games. This is solid and super enjoyable.This is a good play for people who want to have some fun It's too brilliant not to play.My rating: 8.0P.S. My YouTube Channel : Zapsy.

People going for forfeit because they are lagging, or because their toaster is not able to run the game decently, bad internet, or quitting for any other random reason does not help to get a better ELO (ELO is supposed to indicate how good you are...).In conclucion, the game gets a thumbs up the community does not."

,Not Recommended,568810,30185658,Posted: 25 February,all,The Monkey Man,"I really enjoy Freestyle Basketball, and everything I'd seen got me excited for this game, but practically every part of it has dissappointed. Other than the some of the people in the game I can't think of a single redeeming feature of this game, key word there is some, plenty of insufferable ones,These are the gameplay elements that I feel really need to be looked at.Interceptions. It's a pretty fundamental part of the defence, so I wonder why they decided to have intercepts have the possibility of knocking the ball in any direction after you stopped the pass. It's infuriating stopping a pass only for the ball to fly to a guy in prime position to shoot, who you can't stop now because you moved to stop their pass. Tackles also have this possibility so it's not 100% guarenteed to stop the attack but that I can at least understand happening realistically. My player kicking the ball half way across the pitch because they intercepted a slow rolling pass is dumb.Goalkeeper A.I. I've won/lost a handful of games because one keeper preforms better than the other. For something that no one, except defence has control over, and that control is literally just telling him to leave the net or stay on line, it's again infuriating that it can be a key factor of why you lost. As I write this review, I quite literally just lost a game where the enemy team had a 30% pass success rate at the end of the game. They had 2 shots on goal, both directly at the keeper, both going in. Meanwhile our forward had 10 by himself and only managed to score one. We literally played them off the pitch but lost because their A,I, preformed better. The thing is, they can't do anything to fix that. I'd imagine both keepers have the same A.I, so it's literally down the chance, but that shouldn't be a deciding factor in the game. Goalkeepers needs to be a position played by an actual person. You shouldn't lose a game because of something you have little control over.Passing, As a mid-fielder directional passing literally felt almost necessary for me after a certain amount of time. Without it, the game seems to pick the most ridiculous decisions of who you intend to pass the ball to. It's annoying wanting to do throughball to the forward sprinting down the wing, then you kick the ball to the guy directly in front you, heavily marked by 2 people. It's a rare enough occurance, but it's annoying as s**t when it happens. I imagine it's only a possibility to justify the need for the skill to be in the game to honest.Now onto their monetization. Day 1, their method of monetization was quite user friendly you could earn some of the cash-shop items by just playing the game or get discounts for better ones, this was perhaps a bit too user friendly, so I can understand why they wanted to tone it down. But they pretty much removed any user friendly aspect of it. With characters costing $30 and decking your character out in the decent looking equipment costing upto $100 it made their price tag a bit more decent.The game has 3 forms of currency,1.Points, that are earned by completing matches and are used to buy the average looking equipment that last for 12 or 30 days per purchase depending on the amount spent, used for training stats and purchasing skills.2.Coins, which require real money to get, are used to buy the better looking equipment, that last either 12 days, 30 days or an unlimited amount of time depending on your purchase. They can also be used to capsules thar contain the gear you can just outright buy, but from experience this gear always lasts 12 days and you might not even get any gear from them.3. E-Coins are their final form of currency and why I would say this game was quite user friendly with it monetization before they changed how they were earned. E-coins work exactly like coins you purchase with real money, but can be earned in-game by doing daily rewards, where you got 50-150 e-coins, which last 1 week before they expire. They could also be earned from the current event running and I would imagine future events.Initially the events rewards were quite good, you could unlock 2 of the cash shop characters along with 4000 e-coins.  Unfortunately, they recently butchered many of the possible rewards from the event, so now it's a small chance for one of the characters and they lowered the amount e-coins you recieve to 1000, which honestly isn't the bad part, 4000 seemed a bit much anyway in my opinion. On top of that, they removed e-coins as a daily reward, so events are currently the onlyI'm currently level 55, but once I hit 56 and get this last event reward i'll probably be giving this game a long break, and come back to see if they improve anything. Until then I can't really recommend the game. It's fun if you find the right people, but all those negative aspects ruin the game experience for me a bit. I can honestly probably even live with those gameplay issues, but these guys literally♥♥♥♥♥♥on their brand new community within 3 days of releasing the game, so screw em."

,Recommended,568810,30226267,Posted: 27 February,all,The Pengest Munch,"Overall, this game is fun and it will definitely get any football lovers hooked at first and from there on out its whether you decide to keep playing despite many flaws or play, hope for short matchmaking, hope for a nice game, etc.So what makes this game great? Well its pretty much 4v4 fifa for absolutely FREE and for what its worth, its a really nice game. Its fun to play and with the ELO rating it gives us a bigger purpose to keep playing the game: To become number one on the leaderboards. Character customisation is pretty good, which is expected from joycity since their games do have a fair amount of character customisation (fs2 basketball). It's got ""freestyle"" in the name so you can expect to do amazing skills and you have a shop to buy them (in game credits) and equip whichever one you love. The ""skills"" which are just abilities like auto slide tackle are definitely relevant to playing a match as you'll need them to make your player and yourself more experienced and skillful. I don't know what will happen after the launch commemoration event (free stuff for levelling up) but lets wait for that.So the bad details; the cons. It's a game by Joycity. Lets not forget that. Their games are never perfect, and so are their servers. At the moment servers are pretty bad but the game is playable most of the time. There can be frequent disconnections from games for some specific people however im sure a quick restart to the game client wouldn't hurt! Technically, this game is leaning towards the bad side. After playing for a short time, probably one match, you'll easily notice that some of your tackles dont connect, you don't shoot properly, you dont intercept properly, etc. The game isn't that old though, so we can maybe expect many technical updates, although it is Joycity, i don't know how it will work out.THE WORST THING: The controls when configuring gamepad. For me at least, i cannot change controls at all. Whenever i click something to change, it changes to Z-axis which is probably my mouse click. I've tried literally every way to change any controls and that doesn't work. ;(My final rating of this game is a 6 or 7/10 for technicality and 10/10 for enjoyability and replayability. Unless you don't actually like fifa, you can expect to be playing this game alot.MY ADVICE: Do not play this game literally every single moment you're back on the computer. Remember that this is still a game and if you want a game to still be fun to you forever dont play it literally all the time. Trust me, just dont."

It kinda bothers me since I'm a casual player and I generally don't come back to the same games for awhile trying to play this would be hard for me since I'm not dedicating large amounts of time to unlocking these outfits over and over that give you more points toward different skills since most of the ones I've seen only give it to you for 12 days I don't expect myself to play this game more than 3 days top and then I'll probably stop for awhile and come back later when I have nothing and have to start from scratch since I can't purchase any of the items permanently with in game currency. So my review will be a no until they update this and make it more viable for me to want to come back. Other than this I think the game has great potential and others might really enjoy playing even if they have to keep the grind going.

It's one of the best game I've ever played and I have spent thousands of dollers and hours into it. When i moved to Australia 3 years ago i was sad because it was unplayable due to the ping. when i went back to korea the year after for a holiday, it ahd shut down and Freestyle football Z was created so i devoted my time into that. But again, when i came back to AUstralia, it did not work. When this came out on steam i was so excited.However, There needs to be some changes that i would think in helping the game.1, servers need to be more stable and diverse. Currently there is only 3 servers but i hope you expand it to oceania, etc.2, Matching system needs to be fixed for a more balanced game. Im currently a lv 40 SS and im being matched with lv 9s and 10s.3, The pricing on the items could be reduced. When i played the game in Korea, the prices of clothes (permanent) was really cheap. For example, a top would be 5 dollers where as here, it is 14.4, More items including characters. I've played this game for a while and i was there to see the end. I have a good understanding of what characters you will bring out but the characters you have now are way too overpriced for the thing you are getting. It only gives you 24 more stats and doesnt have a special skill or more stats.I hope the developers look at this and also if you want tips to this game if you are new, please add me, ControlTowerI am willing to help anyone who is interested in learning!"

You want to be a defender, you will have stats as a defender, that means that you should be good at intercepting, defend your half before the situation is getting too difficult and aid your GK, block etc. Beeing out of position, or not respecting your role will give you a bad end-result at the end and your party will not be very happy either.There are also more all-round positions, but additional positions options can be unlocked on level 40.In the category soccer games or football games (There seems to be a difference for some people) this is a very enjoyable game with the right people, or just join a guild with like-minded players who also enjoy the game in a nice 4 vs 4."

,Not Recommended,568810,30208800,Posted: 26 February,all,JakeFighter,"02.07.2017The game is dead, they added cards for no reason and absolutely PUMPED the game with P2W aspects, they tried so hard to revive it via events that give free characters but it simply didn't work, the FSF devs are money makers, carry on to FS2.VERY OLD REVIEW BELOW_______________________________________________Compare this (22Feb2017) to FS2 and you'd see the difference is night and day. Not gameplay wise, there's obviously differences between football/soccer and basketball. But compare it in a.. lets say technical way.First the cons.A minor con but,the controls are super unresponsive and sluggish.They're terribly unresponsive, there is a reason to this though, the controls need to act late so you have time to do another move, say, a kick feint, you NEED to press Q afterwards otherwise you'd mess it up and accidentally shoot.Grinding for points takes AGES.Having to train your character to keep up with the stats in the higher ELO/Level games is difficult if points are super hard to get, I've gotten to LVL4 Training and I can't upgrade at all now, takes too much time to just get a ""Training Failed"", either increase the chance of training success or just give us more points.The tackles are super wonky and weird.It seems as if it's ALL RNG based, If you aren't a defender, slide tackles are only possible from the side and stand tackles have a huge chance to miss, I'm assuming the character's only SOLID meshes and entities are the legs,torso and head, seeing as theyre the only thing that can trigger a header,tackle,block, but maybe that's way too technical and more realistic than it should be, I say keep it the way it is right now.Pros:The game is not pay2win AT ALL.Literally. There's nothing that gives others an advantage that they can get with real money, the only real thing they can buy with real money are skill slots, but I'll get to that in a second. Gold coins are purely for cosmetics, and E-Coins were the best idea I've seen in a F2P game in a long time, you're heading in the right direction, devs!The skills.The skills actually seem quite fair.I've played in high elo games as a low lvl character with no skills equipped and I saw no advantage to the opponent's use of skills at all, we all played the same and it was completely skill based rather than SPAMMIDY SPAM SPAM like in FS2.No cards to give extra stats.All clothing items regardless of price or premium/not give the same amount of stats.EVERY single clothing item in the game gives +20 in a stat you choose, premium doesn't give more and non premium don't give less, this is absolutely amazing.There's alot of positions to choose from.You get to branch from:FW to CF, SS, ST, WFMF to DMF, CMF, SMF, AMFDF to SW, CB, WB, LIBEROI have to say I've never heard of the Libero position before, but after doing research I found out that it was an ACTUAL position in real life football!The lobby.The lobby is excellent, it's well made and you don't have to be in the main menu to be invited by people, you also don't need to have people added on every character you have, i'll talk about that next.Manager.Having a manager where you can manage all your characters at once and add people and their characters all at once is quite a good thing to have. In FS2 you had to add people on specific characters, now you can add them by their manager name too!Clubs.Clubs are pretty good, as I said, the same club is on all your characters due to managers. And even after 5 days of the game's release, there's already rivals! Keep fighting for the top spot, mates.Music.The music in this game is such a big improvement from FS2 that it's superior with only 5 songs.None of that ""WE BE BALLIIIIIN"" stuff to annoy you to headaches, you've got quality main menu music IIIN ENGLIIISSHHHH and NO ingame-music, which keeps you focused till the end!My favorite song in the game is Break It Down - Galaxy Express!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiSVPzJvnW8The playerbase.Compared to FS2, even though theres still the arrogant ones around here and there, theres alot less here than there were back in the hellhole.I'll add more pros and cons as time passes by, please tell me what to add and give me your thoughts and opinions!"
,Recommended,568810,30183802,Posted: 25 February,all,Mitorah Games,"This game is pretty awesome. Personally I don't even like the cartoony graphics but who cares when the gameplay is so fun.However, the matches are laggy even though my ping is 30. It's worth the free price anyway but it makes the game a lot less enjoyable than it could be.Only gameplay problem: Clear offsides are sometimes not counted at all and when they are, the offending players are just forced to pass the ball backwards (often back to their own players). So the penalty for offside is too minor in this game. I'd suggest that they were forced to pass the ball without a chance of failure to the opposition 100% of the time in this case."
