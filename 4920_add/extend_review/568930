76561198048974498,Recommended,568930,35021716,Posted: 17 September,all,rjmacready,"Slightly silly title. Really good game.First up, the graphics far exceed the low expectations I've learned to harbour for ""indie"" horror games. This game is frequently gorgeous, from the sheets of drizzling, misty rain through to the shafts of sunlight peering through the trees (during an uncommonly serene opening sequence). Bodies of water are also highly effective, and the monsters in the game memorable and genuinely frightening. Nice.Secondly, the sound - and atmosphere created through the mix of audio and visuals - is top-notch. Long before you ""meet"" anything, the creepy noises of things checking you out from not-so-afar will keep you on your toes. This is a scary game long before the♥♥♥♥♥♥officially hits the fan.Which brings us to a third noteworthy accolade: the build-up. Rare is the horror game which does such a fabulous job of keeping you in the dark - often literally! - in regard to just when the danger will finally emerge from the shadows to menace you. I won't spoil it for you, other than to say that it's quite a while before you'll truly need that ""sprint"" button. But you'll be hitting it in panic long before that anyway, thinking that something must surely be about to beset you at any moment.Now for some more neutral points. The ""puzzles"" are generally solid, if not always entirely logical. I had no idea, for example, that a plank of wood I was carrying about was capable of bridging a gap a good few metres wide. The whole time I thought I was carrying around a stumpy stick, useful at best for beating off feral dwarves, but was in fact lugging about a well-hewn hunk of tree capable of giving a lumberjack back pain (and was still able to sprint from fast-moving monsters whilst doing so).The story, while certainly nothing to complain about, also isn't much of anything to write home about, and starts quite a bit more compellingly than it finishes. It's fine, though, and services the gameplay perfectly well; which, when all is said and done, is what most game ""stories"" are about anyway, aren't they?Downright negatives? There aren't any really, unless you include the lack of remappable keys and the thoroughly stupid decision to have the player jump AFTER the space button is released. You get used to it, obviously, but it kinda sucks when you have to die a few times to get the hang of such things.Look, honestly, I play a lot of indie horror games, and this one gets an awful lot of things ""right"". It's about the right length (around four hours), has about the right balance between linearity and lack thereof (areas seem quite large at first, but you soon whittle them down), is reasonably challenging without being crazy difficult, and has its fair share of chase sequences without them becoming tedious or redundant. And the fact that this was developed by one guy is downright INSANE.An extraordinary effort, all things considered. Pretty much a must-buy for all genuine horror-lovers, and we shall definitely have to keep an eye out for the name Alessandro Guzzo in the near future...Verdict: 9/10."
76561198053422627,Recommended,568930,34965878,Posted: 15 September,all,Zaxtor99 ® YouTube,"This is one of the rare horror indie adventure games on Steam that is actually well worth its asking price.  There are a lot of choices on Steam for this type of a game, and while I livestreamed this entire game in a single sitting on its launch day here on Steam, it was a very fun and gripping game experience.I love the HP Lovecraft style of story woven in that you will gradually uncover until the dramatic and satisfying final ending scene.  The game has a really well imagined and thought out plot and sequence of how you uncover the secrets within waiting to surprise.. and shock you.While I've played a good number of these type of games, this game did make me jump at several points, and even had me screaming to hold on to my life as death itself tried to chase me down.  ..If only I can run just a little fasterrrr!  Runnnnnn!   Awesome and exciting moments for sure!  ..Mix that with a well imagined and good story that you discover as you explore this beautiful world and you have one helluva game for a small price tag!Not without faults, this game hard crashed on me 15 times on its launch day, but thankfully the game does frequently auto-save often, and these autosaves take no time at all, and do not make you wait, so neither crash or death in the game will set you very far back.  Already on just the day after launch, this single developer has already patched the game to fix the crashes, so this is VERY impressive and a quick response to criticism and bugs within his game.  For a developer to respond so quickly and professionally is pure delight and all the more reason I recommend this game and hope that he does very well with this title!  I also look forward to any future titles he might bring to Steam with this title and professionalism shown already.  Love it!My score for this game, even with it's minor faults is a strong 8 out of 10.  Beautiful graphics, gripping and very enjoyable story make this a high recommend for anyone who likes these types of games."

Main focus is on telling the story and ambiance, which it does very well in my opinion. Gameplay consists of finding a certain object (a key, shovel, or other item) which will let you progress. Rinse, repeat. There's also a puzzle or two in there.From time to time a creature will hunt you, but its done in moderation. You're not always chased around and can take in the atmosphere for most of the time.The game looks beautiful on high settings, yet it crashed about 5 times for me, but always after a while of playing. Only a minor concern, since the game autosaves every time you made any kind of progression. Seems its like a memory leak.If you enjoy atmospheric horror adventures with light gameplay I can definitely recommend it. I did enjoy it."

Not only to support him but use this experience for my own research into making my own game.Other than this game being a horror title, it has excellent gameplay. I clocked the game in just under 8 hrs. Great puzzles (love the hint button, used this a couple of times).

,Not Recommended,568930,35119026,Posted: 21 September,all,fantomchoder,"From what I was able to play... it was awesome. The graphics were fantastic with a good attention to detail to build terrifying environments. The sound quality was excellent and helped create a tense atmosphere. From what I played, the story was simple but made me want to keep playing to find out more. However, this game is a technical mess and I gave up on it despite all that.As others have confirmed, the game will randomly crash for no apparent reason. Luckily my save points weren't affected and it always crashes clean so it was easy to pick back up - but yeah, obviously very annoying regardless.I was going to keep playing despite the crashes, but then I lost my save point. I'm on Win10 playing with a Xbox One controller - and the game handles it fine except for the menus. I noticed when starting a new game that, when it asks you to confirm yes or no to begin, moving the thumbstick left/right to choose yes/no didn't highlight the active choice to show what you're about to select with the gamepad. At the time I just blindly moved the thumbstick left toward yes and pushed A which successfully started my new game. When I was done playing for the time being, I hit start and then moved the thumbstick down until I got to the option for exiting the game (these menu texts highlight correctly). Somehow I ended up being prompted for a new game with the blind yes/no confirmation which confused me since I was certain that I hit the exit game menu option. I again blindly moved the thumbstick right toward no and pushed A - and to my surprise it started a new game which wiped out all my previous progress. This is when I learned two annoyances about the controller support for my setup. The first is that the yes/no confirmations don't let me select no at all... it always selects yes regardless of which direction the thumbstick moves. The second is that I can't use my controller to select the option to exit the game. For some reason it skips over the exit game option and moves back to the first option which happens to be start new game. I realized when I thumbsticked down to the menu option before exit, I hit down and then A very quickly without confirming that exit actually highlighted which then lead me to the confirmation that doesn't let me say no. And there's my lost progress.A few other annoyances were some delays when pressing jump which seemed to be randomly mistimed and poor collision detection with objects. There's some areas where your character tends to get a bit stuck, or an impossible jump that looks easily feasible.Very disappointed that I couldn't finish it."

76561198219302152,Not Recommended,568930,35223435,Posted: 26 September,all,twice_crispy,"This game lacks any sort of design concept. Most of the time you walk aimlessly through the woods, looking for randomly placed items. I don't think this game was tested by anyone other than then dev before releasing it. A good example of this is when you find the house with the lamp on inside on the second floor and there is a broken ladder where the character says something like ""the ladder is broken. I need to find another way up."" I looked around that area for a good long while and didn't find anything that would allow me to climb up, so I decided to forget it and keep going. I hit a trigger that made me turn around because the character said something like ""I'm not done looking in this area yet"". So I continued to waste time looking for a ladder that didn't exist. Got fed up and tried much luck going down the trail again. This time it let me go past where it had initially turned me around and sent me back to the cabin. I walked a long ways down the trail to, my surprise, find a ladder. There's nothing that would have hinted that I should go far away from my current location to look for a ladder to use. It's a game of randomness and guessing. That doesn't make for engaging gameplay. I understand the dev is probably only a dev and not a designer, but at least have people test the game and give some feedback.Aside from that, the game look pretty. the atmosphere is kind of creepy at first, but the beauty is quickly drown out by frustration of a lack of design. This is more of a walking simulator than it is a horror game."

I feel like that wasn't play-tested at all. While it's pretty, it's increadibly boring to do all that running at the start. The location of the ladder vs where you need it is pretty poor design, imo. In addition to all the running, it's dark as hell and increasing the brightness requires a full reboot of the game.It also crashed on me, which put me over the edge of requesting a refund."

I couldn't believe my eyes when ( after I had been stuck for ages ) finally cheating and looking on youtube I could indeed jump across the 'dead-end', the distance for the character to jump was unrealistic but that that is what you do! also the monster appears too much at the beginning of the game when usually games do the opposite they make a game harder as you go on not easier. so why do I recommend the game? because the graphics the music the sounds the atmosphere the story  is up there with top-notch games. if you loved amnesia the dark descent then you will love this it could even be scarier!"

I urge any potentially intersted person to try the demo; it will give you an idea of the core gameplay and performance. Keep in mind the most interesting ideas and experiences are found in the main game.The Land of Pain provided a harrowing experience well worth the price. The developer has created wonderully tense and oppressive environments, where I could almost feel the weight of the surrounding darkness pressing in.  While the graphics are as pretty as you might expect from CryEngine, I was struck in particular with the stellar sound design; every creak, rustle, and squeak in the game seems perfectly placed to make me freeze in place out of fear.The story is engaging, with world-building that quickly moves in directions I doubt any would be able to predict, though it does adhere to a familiar Lovecraftian tradition. The monster is not a constant companion as in other games, but its presence is felt more accutely when  it appears, and the dread of it never truly went away as I played.The puzzles are not particularly complex, but are enjoyable and offer some challenge. They are helped by the fact that exploring the world is compelling on its own. The Land of Pain has game play, story, visuals, and audio to entertain for a few good hours, with a good price. I thoroughly enjoyed my time running, hiding, and exploring in it. The main character does walk kinda funny, though."

Graphics and atmosphere are quite good (especially for indie title), story is not bad but the ending is kinda rushed. I didn’t encounter any gamebreaking or serious bugs. The UI needs polishing, especially for controllers. I played with “experimental” version, which is the same as patch 1.02 released on Sep. 29 and had zero crashes. The price is right and considering it’s made by a single developer I highly recommend it, we should support such independent developers in the age of microtransactions, paid mods and “horse armour” DLCs."

There are multiple times where you would almost think you are actually walking through the woods.  Not sure if the game originally had dialog or not, but being a European (I believe Italian) made game translated to english did not have any dialog, just subtitles.  I look foward to seeing another game released by this developer."
,Recommended,568930,35467260,Posted: 4 October,all,kamyk,"Well that was interesting, a nice little lovecraftian game that didn't stink.  Fairly immersive to a point, and a couple of interesting twists.  Definitely in the adventure category as it mostly consists of finding and using items, definitely an item hunt.  I do have to say there were a very few points where what you were supposed to do or where to go next was a little obscure, and a couple of the item orders will have you scratching your head at the lack of realistic logical setup. Without giving anything away I'll just say that it seems like an awful lot of trouble for cultists to go to every time they want to open their secret entranceIt has pretty good atmosphere, and it made me jump a few times.  After a while though you get used to the rules of the chase and it looses a ltittle of it's tension.  The first person is very smooth, although crossing narrow boards, or jumping gaps is a bit clunky at times (not that it really matters as checkpoints are plentiful).  The graphics are superb as one would expect from someone using cryengine. The music is suitably atmsophereic, although what really made me most tense were the occassional periods of absolute silence. On sound I have to say it went a tiny bit extra.   In the woods, you hear twigs cracking  that you didn't step on letting you know that you aren't alone out there.  Animals sometimes go silent around threat. Large bushes swish when you go through them.   Nice little touches.  I didn't notice any glaring graphical or technical issues, and overall it was fun.  A tad short, taking me 5,7 hours, so expect 4-6 depending on how much sightseeing you do.If I had any real complaint about it, it would be the font size of the readables.  Anyone with bad eyes not sitting within 6-8 inches of the monitor will be lucky to be able to read any of it.Overall, I quite enjoyed it.  On a scale of 1 to 10 (Amnesia being my 10)  I'd give it a 7.5"
