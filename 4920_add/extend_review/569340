I don't know if they used ASMR for recording sounds, but I was having goosebumps quite a few times. Or maybe it's just that the story really got to me.On the other hand, it sure is short and it lacks replayability (or maybe after a month or so it will have similar effect as during your first playthrough). And achievements implementation is kinda out of tune with the game's motif. They can easily destroy the bittersweet feeling you get from the play. I wish it had only one achievement after the playthrough."

I actually quite liked the concepts and certain aspects of Thing-In-Itself. The game, delves into how the protagonist deals with being rejected however the game only scratches the surface of its topic and then ends. After playing it I hit youtube to see a handful of other peoples reactions and sadly their reaction was the same. Not left in deep contemplation like you might have after playing other thought provoking sims, but instead,  wanting more and going 'I paid $2.5 for something that feels incomplete'. And in all thats the reason why I am not recommending this game.Whilst it has some interesting ideas, and the function of the game is fine. But after feeling like playing a student game that only just barely achieve what it wants to. I would recommend this game if it were free.Reviews can be edited, so I shall amend my recommendation if this title were to ever become free. For the amount of money you spend, with the amount of polish and emphasis on its own topics. I simply cannot recommend this game for any price.You can see further details, and developers I put in a section of constructive critism in this video -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkOKeszNL_4"

It really shows how someones point of view is reality to that certain person. This was an interesting game and has likable characters that you get pretty attached to over such a quick time. There are a decent amount of choices in the game, but it doesn't effect what's going to happen much. I enjoyed this game and it caused me to look back at my past. If you are looking for a game that might cause some thinking or isn't like the usual game then this is for you. If you are an achievement hunter then this is an easy perfect game.

76561198045463716,Recommended,569340,29786328,Posted: 8 February,all,gentlyreadlit,"Over three acts taking just under 15 minutes total to play through, we experience a moment in the life of the characters Ted (voiced by actor Sam Retford) and Molly (voiced by Gray) and Ted’s fish, Henry. The point of view of the game is Ted’s as he and Molly have three conversations. Without revealing too much about the plot, we are acting through Ted’s eyes as he deals with the dissolution of relationships.Intimate games like Thing-In-Itself allow us to pick up philosophical concepts (or psychological or moral, if you prefer) in a casual manner–the game it cheap, brief, and simple to play (although in no way easy).Thing-In-Itself perhaps gets too mired in solipistic thinking or, rather, the tension between subjectivity/objectivity leads to easily to making sweeping generalizations actually moving us farther from understanding. But all in all, the brevity of the game and its intensity in the moment make for a lasting, quality experience. For a debut game, Party For Introverts have done well with Thing-In-Itself."

76561197989132185,Recommended,569340,29045202,Posted: 5 January,all,pulp-reduced,"I just finished reading a book on Kant. For all the complexity, for all the supposedly speculative wonder of the Thing-in-itself, there is no proper way to imagine, observe, or grasp it in any particular way. It comes about through practical reasoning, thinking with finality. You could call it baseless, a sort of “frictionless spinning in a void”. And Thing-in-Itself, the game, seem to acknowledge this to some extent.This is good, since there is truly no suprasensible entity that is open to the understanding other than a purely speculative one, in the pure negative; illusory, even. Teleology becomes a divine concept when it comes to conclusions of this kind. What else can determine or be imagined to will these things into existence? How can we transcend our human nature, or our tendencies? We never do. When we claim we do we simply posit another version of our tendencies, the practical speculative tendencies that lead to suprasensible concepts.Another tendency is rejecting and being rejected. But before I get into it, I should just touch on the fact that the “game” distances itself from being called a game in a traditional sense. It recoils away from the regular definitions put forth in game's media and deems itself an experience and hopes you enjoy it. But was it meant to be enjoyed? Is this not an incredibly sad story? There was no palpable sense of enjoyment here, other than the hints of philosophical concepts, that I enjoy. It sets up a premise of the world being seen through the subject, which is proper, and does this in an interesting way. Where objects in your room change their nominal determination based on the current mood of the “played” character. Door remains Door, though, for a while, which I thought was very funny.But it does evolve into becoming this interesting comment on the fleeting nature of our perception of the world. But maybe it should not be made into this great commentary. Instead it seems we simply change our Umwelt, the immediate surrounding and its conceptual linkages. Each sensible experience leaves conceptual effects, stemming from habit, or past experience and its repetitions. Mutable contexts precipitate a conceptual change. And I imagine we all experience it to some extent, only not to this absurd degree. And this is what is properly Kantian about this game. There are only concepts, between them is empty space, a void. This does not seem to be as properly connected to our intuitive being-in-the-world, our immediate presence and experience. Our brute experience, you could say. And this aspect is neglected entirely.Because is the only answer to these situations to pathetically subject oneself to the conceptual sphere? To not understand humanity as more than its concepts? Why can things not be met with silence proper, in this game? There is the “...” response, but where is the hanging up option? Where is the do-not-call option? We inflate the subjugating aspect of humanity while ignoring the schizoid and indeterminate one, to put it in Deleuzian terms.But only what is there is there. Kantian philosophy is not my thing, in general. Maybe this game wasn't either. It's a miserable thing to put one in the shoes of being rejected, with the sad longing for words where they are no longer truly meaningful. Why should I be subjected to this? Should I have stopped playing? That would be the proper thing to do, but I subjugate myself to the experience of this creation for the sake of writing about it. So I can only blame myself. But I am just asking really what the point was. Is the point of this game to feel empathy? To watch the nominal world change its appearance? In a way I do not find this possible to represent. In fact, it is changed entirely in the process of making a game. To the player, we only see a difference in text, and name, whereas truly it would be a much more full-bodied experience. It would be truly an exhausting things to look at these objects of sprouting associations of longing and confusion. It would be painful. And in the game, instead, it felt like a cute concept. But these things are not in their true appearance cute concepts or cute representations of philosophical concepts. They are much more severe and serious. And perhaps this is conveyed if the player find they can relate to these changes in words that are coupled with mood-changes. At times I could, at times I could not see it as more than what it was: words, only words.Objects are in their true sense not numerical. You cannot quantify the experience of an object without the arbitrariness of delineating it. We already play this out with presuppositions that are not thought-through with any kind of exegesis or critical mindset. There is no freedom in this idea, other than through the faculty of imagination. And who cares about this frictionless frictionlessness?What else can be said about this thing? It's straight forward, it does not set out to do much, but I can perhaps say it succeeds in what it tries to do. I would recommend it for its novelty, even for the idea that philosophical concepts can be expressed through games. Because I see a great possibility in this endeavor, and I think with a more exciting concept, at least for me personally, it would be a truly amazing experience, or an educational experience, even. Games as education have been around for a while, so why not add philosophy to the curriculum? This is a decent start to show some of the philosophy that came out of the era of the German idealists. I dread the day where Hegel gets a game in his honor. But that dread is of equal parts excitement. And that is a sentiment I could just as easily apply to Thing-in-Itself, the game.Sadness or the misery of this kind is not necessarily something that cannot be enjoyed. It is still interestingly put together, albeit in a minimalistic manner. It has enough elements to put forth its ideas and emotional ground, even if the former was done with greater novelty and while warranting more intrigue than the latter. But perhaps the emotional aspect of the game was subservient to the Ideas, in a way I saw this as being the case, and that might validate the pointless misery of it. Practical solutions to serve the Ideas. IDEA! IDEA! IDEA! REASON! REASON! REASON!♥♥♥♥ all of it, I don't care. This is not writing, this is an experience, I hope you hated it. I hope you see a bubble with text inside of it that says “I hate this writing, this is bad writing”. Okay. Buy the game, support interesting things, it's cheap and short, who cares."

It feels unfortunate that it started so close to the end of the relationship.I do think it's worth playing & recommending, but it could have been a much better experience were it longer."

It leaves you wanting to understand the characters more and their reasons, but it just stops the way it does. This is not a critique to the length of the game, but in that time I could have been given a deeper sense of connection to the story so i wouldn't just be left with an ""uh, okay..?"". Mabye its partly subjective because ive dealt with peoples traumas and personal luggage to realize why they can react in ways like this.

I think the experience might also be affected by your previous knowledge of the central concept of the game - since I'm somewhat familiar with things-in-themselves and similar empirical arguments, I wanted the game to take the idea further, and felt that what I saw was mostly a re-hashing of something familiar (though tied to everyday life experiences in a clever way). For someone who's new to the concept, I think this is a fun way to get an introduction! And it did remind me of something I learned about a long time ago, which I appreciate. It just felt a little ""Philosophy 101"". All of this to say, in the longest way possible, that the game is fun for what it is - a brief musing on one of Kant's ideas that is cheap to buy and quick to play, and that's probably all it's supposed to be! I hope the creators continue making games, and perhaps something longer and more complicated, in the future. I'm sure they'd be very enjoyable and thought-provoking."
