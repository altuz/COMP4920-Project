The backgroud is designed to make the game look like its being played in an arcade game which is pretty nifty. Unfortunately I didn't find Space Distant to really be offering anything that other, cheaper games already do better."

76561197971341065,Recommended,569610,28498044,"Posted: 20 December, 2016",all,sfnhltb,"Space Distant is a fairly basic Space Invaders update, although not all that much of an update, and it is inferior to the original in a few ways, although it has a few good points as well. You aren't likely to get a huge amount of play time out of it, but it is okay for what it is.You get three repetitions of five levels of growing difficulty (mostly more shots raining down from more alien types) then a boss fight - the normal waves are fairly easy although you have to take care as you have three lives to clear all 18 levels - as unlike the original the aliens don't advance down the screen you can play it safe in the middle of the screen and take your time picking them off - each alien type fires in a different way, and the more powerful ones take a few hits to go down as well, which tends to make the sides of the screen dangerous particularly when certain alien types are present. You do also (randomly?) get a triple shot attack for a short while when you kill an alien (or a missile), which can help clear the screen fast.The boss fights are a bit more interesting (and difficult) as you have the combination of a constant rain of shots you have to stay ahead of and dodge between to keep attacking the boss, but also after a short while the boss will also launch missiles (which you can shoot or feint and dodge), and then start doing both at once, which is where it gets difficult not to get hit. The bosses look different but seem to behave the same - well, the first two did as far as I noticed, haven't got to the third yet - and that may take a while as the green wave aliens make things tough in level 14.The controls are fairly responsive, and the graphics are basic but clear, apart from the one exception of the cyan enemies shot coming down being fairly hard to notice if you are shooting in place, but overall this is fine for what it is, but don't expect to play it for long (or more than once), and there is little innovation or interesting in this example of a very well trodden genre."

I liked the variety in enemy formations and even though it is a space invaders ripoff, I enjoyed  the simplistic gameplay a lot. If you came to this game for an easy 100%, you are in the wrong place. It is important to know that you will never complete this game. Never have I seen achievements be so straight foreward yet be so impossible. All in all for the price that I bought it for (couple of cents) this game was insanely difficult (just wait for lvl 15) and a lot of fun. Recommended for people with inhuman reaction speed and a lot of spare time."

,Recommended,569610,31278251,Posted: 21 April,all,Thundra the Sexy Sex Offender,"The game is kinda cool at the start, but dude, they went overboard with the missiles on the last levels. It's really annoying how you can only get hit 3 times in the entire game, and you can easily get hit 3 times on the last 2 levels. That, combined with the fact that you must start from the beginning of the game when you lose, makes it very difficult to complete, and to get the last achievements. A stage selection screen would've been very helpful, or at least some form to get health back. I really hope they add something like that someday, because IT IS really annoying."
,Recommended,569610,28497609,"Posted: 20 December, 2016",all,Redbeard,"Space Distant is a retro-styled version of Space Invaders.There's not a lot to it - just the usual case of shoot down the aliens before they get you.Some of the bigger aliens take more than one shot to kill.Several aliens shoot diagonally.The first boss is massive and has heat-seeking missiles(Apparently there is a second boss - at level 15? - but I haven't got that far yet.)Although Space Distant doesn't specify what controls the game uses, after having spent thousands of dollars on exhaustive research and private investigators, I can now reveal that they are:Spacebar = shootArrow keys = move left and rightThis game is not one you would want to play over and over again.But, then again, it has achievements, so you might want to play it a few times to get those.It's a cheap game, just under a dollar, so you can't go too wrong with it - however, considering how basic it is, I would have thought that 50 cents would be more reasonable.For a cheap game it's ok, but nothing more than that."

Its really hard to actually play this game, I thought it would be easy to win the game, but it isn't which I really like a challenge.If you like a challenge while playing a game, you might as well try this game, because it is is very very compeitive.
