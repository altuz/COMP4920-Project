,Recommended,569630,34301311,Posted: 16 August,all,SKΛTΞºʳÐ¡Ξ☠  [222],It's fun.  Highly recommend to those interested in a zombie tower defense.  Plus you can shoot big guns and use melee.After the tutorial.  The game starts off with you defending a pub for 3-5 minutes.  They just drop you in the middle of a zombie apocalypse with a real sense of panic.  Looking everywhere for shotgun shells.  Zombies breaking windows and climbing in.The animations and decapitation ragdolls are just plain fun.There's even a little pug dog that you throw a tennis ball and he runs over and discovers sh*t and heals survivors.The god view and setting up towers in a gas station parking lot is amazing if you like tower defense.  Upgrading.  Resupplying ammo.  Sending survivors out to collect scrap and hoping they don't die.I think this game is perfect.  I love it.  I like it WAY MORE than the original Out of Ammo.  GG!

Out of Ammo was a great idea, and his concept was (still is) very experimental for virtual reality, mixing strategy and shooting action, tabletop and first person perspective. They worked hard adding more game modes and contents, but still the game was a bit out of focus without real goals.Where Death Drive is built over the Out of Ammo foundations, is just more than a simple upgrade. This is actually a real game, with a campaign than mixes first person and third person chapters in a meaningful way. It has a story and a very humorous zombie environment, I laughed several times finding my all time favourite weapon inside (there are countless weapons to use): a stylized Gibson Flyng V electical guitar used as an axe, than actually is a dangerous thing to manage for your safety even in real life.First person missions are not just about killing waves of zombies, where this is obviously an important part of the game. It implements a  nice dash teleport locomotion like Raw Data, and if you're using a melee weapon you can dash over enemies inflicting damages. Third person are basically the old Out of Ammo way to play, with additional resources to extract like a common RTS, because your goal is to collect enough scraps to continue your journey. You still can use any unit in first person to fight, if you prefer this approach.A classic issue with the old Out of Ammo was the weak frame rate, and an annoying aliasing. Both are no more a problem, the game run just fine with a 970 and everything is sharp. The only real issue I can mention is the overall lenght, I wish the game was longer (can be finished in less than two hours) but the price is reasonable for the quality delivered and old owners can get a 20% discount buying the Fun Bundle."
,Recommended,569630,34352945,Posted: 19 August,all,GreenFireToast,"Good concept, well executed and reasonably priced. You should get itEDIT: so it turns out the game is pretty short, I beat the campaign in 2 hours, but its still enjoyable and I think reasonable for the price. I really hope the devs bring some updates though to better flesh out the systems they have in place. I felt like just as I finally got hte hang of properly positioning buildings and upgrading them the game ended. Would like to see either a few more levels, or an endless mode of sorts, and would like buildings to have more than one level of weapon upgrade. Still a good game. initial review continues belowThe campaign has you roaming from place to place in a van, with the levels being places you need to stop for one reason or another. You get some sequences that are played in first person, and they're enjoyable. The majority of levels so far are the strategy types where you build defences and position your guys. They added a mechanic where you're not just defending from endless waves which is nice and increases the challenge. When you arrive you assign a couple guys to collecting scrap who will be defenseless while they collect, so you protect them until you have enough resources to complete the level, at least for the first few levels. That's the core gameplay loop for now, and though its simple it's a lot of fun.I think I'm on the 5th mission or so, with an hour and half clocked. Not sure how long the game is but really enjoying it so far. Starts off pretty easy but gets challenging when they introduce new enemy types."

,Recommended,569630,34689203,Posted: 2 September,all,Dominus,"Out of Ammo was one of the first VR games I have played that is not no-brainer shooter.I really liked the idea they went for but application was somewhat lacking.Death Drive feels better in gameplay-wise and it has a soul compared to Out of Ammo.Although game is fun, it is way too short to next to none replayability.Once I finished the campaign, I have tried the ""hard mode"" - appreciate devs going for that by the way.To be honest, it didn't feel like a challenge even in the hard mode. It is fun to play but it's not in any way challenging to play.This can be a hard turn off for some folks along with it's campaign being really short. So keep an eye out for that.I have enjoyed it but if I knew it was this short and easy - I would probably wait for some difficulty fine-tuning and extra content or a sale.Nevertheless, I recommend the game because we need more devs doing some out of box games in the endless sea of no-brainer shooters of VR. Gameplay feels great and makes you feel VR has much more place to grow except shooters.PS. for some reason Steam shows 0.2 play time. Actually completed campaign twice on normal and hard mode. Not sure why it's not shown."

,Recommended,569630,34306377,Posted: 17 August,all,WeirdWizardDave,"The World has fallen to a Zombie apocalypse (again) naturally the only choice is to make some desperate journey to find safety, luckily some nice chaps in an RV provide just such a chance! As I shall (inevitably) demonstrate in video formhttps://youtu.be/ibogMyq6loQGameplay consists of a mix of pure first person fights for survival in a variety of locations and real time strategy/tower defence like missions which have you towering over the battle like some sort of giant, ordering defences to be constructed and upgraded or leaping into the action directly by taking control of a survivor.Its very polished and satisfying, with an endearing simple art style. As you would expect from a squeal the gameplay is slick and well paced with a great amount of content for the price (Although more would always be good).Cons: Teleport movement isn't ideal and the restriction in where you could move to had me struggling to reach scrap piles without hitting things in the real world occasionally.Zombies aren't very dangerous in the first person missions.Would also love a spectator cam for making better video content, but that's purely a youtuber thing."

,Recommended,569630,34316445,Posted: 17 August,all,Double Dose VR,"Video of gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=♥♥♥♥4jG5DiMThe video has the letters F, A, and G in it right in a row so steam is censoring that part of the URL and it doesn't work.  to see the video go here:http://www.youtube.com/c/doubledosevrThis game is fantastic!  There are LOADS of weapons, from lightsabers to sniper rifles.  There is a story to this game instead of it being a tower defense wave shooter.  In between each tower defense sequence is a mission where you must do things in first person such as gathering supplies or surviving for 4 minutes in a pub awaiting rescue.  This game isn't too short, especially for the price point.  The amount of weapons you can choose from makes this game more replayable.  It'd be great if the developers add co op in a future update."

Very hard to actually die though, plenty of weapons and with no teleport cooldown its a breeze. Im expecting the survival modes to be the same as the last game. So no problem for me there."

I honestly would've rather this been a DLC for the base game, but I understand that this would be pretty hard to add in to the main game.I was kinda hoping for more levels, and more exploration levels (like the mall and pub), but the game just came out and I really hope new content comes soon.This is probably the 2nd funniest VR game i've played, the number one spot being Rick And Morty Virtual Rickality.What are some good and bad things about this game? Well, here it is!Good-A guy in a flying bathtub-Decapitating zombies with a claw, then burning them with the claw-Base defense-DOGGO-Dean Xtreme Action Figure (limited supply)-Hilarious concept-BOAT-PizzaBad-Some times, survival missions take a while to complete. I've had to restart some a few times, but it's all a learning process for next time-Mall level took me a while, 25% spooked, 25% killing zombies, 50% trying to find the items because they're near impossible to find-No multiplayer-Limited contentThat's all I can say bad about the game.If you loved Out of Ammo and wished it had zombies, buy this, full price. It's a great game, very fun. Thank you, Out of Ammo devs, for making this masterpiece! I shall play more when more content comes!"

Not a fan of the teleport.And being able to move around when zoomed out would be nice too, or be lower angled, since you're always looking straight down it gets a bit hard on the neck.Difficulty setting would be a welcome addition too."

,Recommended,569630,34321805,Posted: 17 August,all,HOPWhiteyFord,"Very Fun game. A little bit of light RTS / resource management and a mix for levels where you are on your own. The strategy view rewards experimentation to find the optimum approach to winning a level. It has about 60 to 90 minutes of fresh content, but you can always test yourself with different playstyles and increase that amount. Also, the writing is refreshingly light and whimsical considering the subject matter."

76561197972207517,Not Recommended,569630,34378890,Posted: 20 August,all,RIZIN86,"I really like the concept and mechanics of this game. I dont have much play time because I was getting pretty frustrated with how dificult it can be to select units or structures when they are close together. If I wanted to possess a unit who was standing just outside a bunker it would almost always possess a unit standing inside the bunker. This would happen over and over basically leaving that unit useless untill he walked away on his own. Trying to hold my hand at just the right angle to select the unit I want would often lead to accidental upgrades and resources spent on a structure. I understand that I could avoid this with more carefull placement of my units. I could try harder to keep them away from each other but that feels like a chore especially when things get hectic. This may not be a problem for others but for me it made me put the game down. I feel like out of ammo worked better as far as unit selection.I also think the voice acting is pretty rough but the dialog can be genuinely funny when its not overly cheesy. Some of the melee weapons are held at odd angles, making them awkward to use.My overall feeling about the game is that its good but has some frustrating flaws. I was really excited to play it but it left me disapointed. I will play it again and if they address some of these issues I will change my review to recommend.I felt the price is good for the content and experience they offer."

However they simply don't need them as the difficulty doesn't ramp up.Picking up items felt clunky and unintuitive which lead to the first person missions simply not being fun.Personally controling the towers was more of a gimic than actually useful, as the AI was perfectly capable of manning them. Nor was it intresting as the weapons stayed the same depenent on the tower built.Overall pretty dull experience."
