76561198086542708,Not Recommended,569760,29178246,Posted: 10 January,all,UnimaginativeHandle,"Start to finish in 22 minutes & a splash screen that informs me that 'This is just the beginning. Thank you for support!'. I won't be supporting it.Firstly, no full screen option & everything seemed to have an odd blur about it, I'm used to Unreal Engine & CryEngine indie games having an odd gloss to surfaces, but all the graphics seemed hazy & off-putting but not in an uneasy horror sense or a 'we tried to do a film grain' effect sense.Anyway, this starts out as one of those horror games where you have little direction (but not a 'we won't hold your hand' game) & you have to wander the map passing over triggers for some jumpscare or other & then wander the map again until something else that isn't particularly scary happens & when it locks you in a room or similar trope; the pauses for effect are way too long, you can take in the entire bathroom in about 2-3 seconds, but it makes you wait for another 8 to 10 seconds for the standard trigger of a thumping at the door. You get these too-long-delays a few times in an admittedly short game, but I've played too many of these types of games for it to not annoy me immediately so this might be nitpicking.It sticks with this style for the first 2 stages & then the game then becomes a P.T.-them-up for what felt like ages but was probably about 10 minutes of just corridors & occasionally a woman who was evil or injured, maybe we had something to do with it; there was a story with subtitles & voice-acting which were both adequate, but it was still poorly communicated as to why we were there & our involvement.It boiled down to a basic ""did I?...what have I done?!?!' story & it wasn't worth it; it also seemed odd that they bothered to do voice acting but there aren't incidental voice acting parts from the player character like a ghost woman was literally on fire in front of you & you remain completely silent; are you paralysed with fear?Bugs: during the first stage, pressing F on things that aren't interactable doors won't trigger the door handle sound; but from the second stage onwards the game just plays that whenever hit the F key no matter where you are or what you're doing. Never know how much playtesting these games go through but seeing as this game is basically directional keys, mouse movement & the F key, there really isn't an excuse for not testing it thoroughly).Also at one point during the second section, there is dialogue that says something like 'what's happening? I can't move' but you aren't prevented from moving & then he has a conversation with his injured grandmother but there isn't any additional character models around, not even the ghost woman. This could be one of those 'this is a jumpscare where you should be forcing the players field of view to look at the jumpscare but you don't so it doesn't make sense' moments that you get in a lot of indie horror games on Steam, but who knows at this point.Returned"

Bequest is not worth your time at the moment.The grainy graphics do conjure a bit of a sinister atmosphere, and the music and sounds help a little too. Because of this I wanted to give the game a chance. There really is very little to do. There is far more story in the Steam Store description than you ever get in the game. The actual voice acting of the main character is fairly well recorded, but makes little sense and contributes nothing to story or plot. The voices provided for the ghost or ghosts, are awfully done; people trying to sound 'horrifying' with a bit of reverb and altered playback speed it seems.There are no options except for language and volume, and if there is a way to exit the game without ending the process then it is fairly well hidden. There is no kind of interface to control things in the game other than WASD and E or F, which seem to be used interchangeably.I will not mention specific events to avoid spoilers:You have to interact with items to make another item available. This takes place in only a handful of rooms. It takes a lot of interaction to get from the first few rooms to the next. Every now and then an object falls over or an image appears. Even accompanied by a sudden, dissonant chord, they are not scary in this game. It seemed to me as though you have too much warning that something is about to ""shock"" you.At one of the major ""shocks"", it was impossible (in my three games) to know if you died, were knocked out or just pushed into the previous location. There is zero in the way of story or explanation of events as you go along.The game environment may have made for a good story if one was present. Perhaps it will in the future. At the moment, there really is nothing to see here except for someone making a few spooky looking rooms with Unreal Engine."
,Not Recommended,569760,29307080,Posted: 16 January,all,JohnWolfeYT,"The description on this page says this game will be provided with ""additional content afer its release."" This is, of course, describing an Early Access title, but the game isn't classified as such.Bequest currently has 20 minutes of ""content"" before suddenly ending in a ""Thanks for supporting!"" screen. The 20 minutes consist of walking down looping hallways and up/down stairs until doors open up to the next area, and there are poorly timed, constant jumpscares throughout. That's it. That's the ""game.""You can find plenty of free games on Itchio/GameJolt with more quality than this, and almost exactly the same P.T.-clone gameplay. Just to name a few: Continuous. Dead Man's Journey. RE77. Repeat. Mind's Eyes. Hell, just play P.T. if that's what you're looking for - there's no reason to spend five bucks on a subpar, unoriginal ripoff like this one.If you're just looking for something scary for half an hour of fun, you don't even need to spend money. Google ""Notes of Obsession"" or ""The House Abandon"" and thank me later. Just don't waste your money on this garbage."
,Not Recommended,569760,29171723,Posted: 10 January,all,Gordon Freeloaf,"I can say off the bat it's not worth it. Yes, I don't have a lot of play time in the game, but it's far from what I would call a game in it's current state. I can't even go into full screen with it or pause the game at all. The character sounds like a really stereo-typical Canadian you'd hear in movies. And at the same time, the character sounds completely oblivious and unaware of the obvious things around him (which is very few, and not even remotely scary). I am not at all sure if these positive reviews are just bulls**** fake ones, considering the only reviews in English think for the most part its garbage and the rest Non-English ones think its great. How?? But I can't honestly reccommend it in it's current state. This isn't even Pre-Alpha ready. Star Citizen is further along than this game in development. This should say It's early access, otherwise its deceiving. Thank Valve for refunds though. But steer clear of this one ladies & gents. This isn't even worth making a YouTube video if you were thinking it."

,Not Recommended,569760,29843633,Posted: 11 February,all,Seaniemaurice,My updated review here -https://youtu.be/fAkDlCU8yGASo turns out the developer has remade his game for unknown reasons. I can only imagine Harshly Critical and Mr Kravins reviews tarnished the original title being Bequest resulting in the developer going back to the drawing board.Taste Games have downgraded what was originally Bequest with 'Last Answer' with a game that isn't a game. Nothing literally happens. This developer is a scammer and charges $2 for a game with no content. If you purchase this... refund it as soon as you realise.My original review of bequest before Taste Games changed it -https://youtu.be/qCK2o5jDQmY
76561198079754370,Not Recommended,569760,29310280,Posted: 16 January,all,DarkSquirrel,"Its an early access game, only about 20-30 min worth of play time. Altogether i was unimpressed. The sound for the voices was low even at max volume. The graphics are sub par for the horror genre. The jump scares are overused and play repetitive sounds. The enviroment jumps to horror elements too quickly preventing any kind of build up for suspense. The character doesnt react sensibly during horror scenes and he also walks extremely slow. I would not recommend this game at this stage of development."
,Not Recommended,569760,29183270,Posted: 11 January,all,Huckleberryhound,"https://youtu.be/j0iqt-skKHsBefore i start, i have to first apologise to the devs what what will be a thumbs down. It's possible nae likely that you spent a lot of time on this, and for an arm chair critic to♥♥♥♥♥♥on it must be tough. Also, i should point out thta when i bought this game (on day of release), it already had 23 reviews. This is odd...i do this a lot, and it's worthy of note.This game is not a game. It's a Ghost train walk through, with no apparent ""game play"" unless you count ""Press F to activate jump scare"". I make videos of small indie games called !The first 15 minutes of..."" where i play the start of a game, and see how long it takes before i like or get bored of it. It's not very original, but it's what i do. This game is not...well, a game. It has horror aspects, it has walk through to jump scare moments, but nothing i can see where there is any skill or anything that would affect the outcome.I bought it for €3.49...it's full price (according to steam) is €4.99. For 5 euro i'd feel royally ripped off by this. If they advertised it as a game, anyway...which the did.Sorry guys, but i have to be honest.Peace...Huck"

The games voice acting and canned sound effects are the least of it's worries. As a gamer looking for the next Allison Road or P.T, this isn't it. The scariest thing about this game has to be it's narrative driven story and thrilling gameplay ""Sarcasm"". Bequest needs alot of work before i can feel comfortable recommending it. You can heck out the video below for my full walkthrough and impression of Bequest.https://youtu.be/lR-GdQpXvxo"
,Not Recommended,569760,29880846,Posted: 12 February,all,Reasonableman,"The game formerly known as Bequest, now Last Answer, was previously kind of fun and hilarious. Now, after the update and name change, it appears to be broken and impossible to complete. The price also dropped by 50%, so really, anyone who bought this game because they liked what they saw of it got completely boned. It is actually worse than when it originally released, and that is something else."
,Not Recommended,569760,29195627,Posted: 11 January,all,The Jigsaw Man,Russian trollware- No save (15 min long game so didn't need one)- Defauls in a 2k + wide resolution to look hardcore- Alt + F4 to escape to look hardcore- Game involves walking around tripping jump scares to progessuntil the protagonist gets locked in a dark room talking to his grandmotherfrom this point you can't see anything and can't find your way out.Some people (I don't know how) got past this and a short time later game endswith a 'Thanks for supporting us' splash screen.Basically a short protoype to fund a larger projectTrollhouse cookies are $2 cheaper and taste better so save your $
,Not Recommended,569760,30229887,Posted: 27 February,all,^4W^7ar^4M^7achine,"12 minutes of playtime, I had to let the dogs out just as I started so about 2 minutes.So you change resolution, you crash, you press tab, you get stuck and crash, Cntrl Alt Del shouldnt have to be a method of stopping a program.Steam has it setup where you get instant refund on♥♥♥♥♥♥games like this, mine is already here."

It was mediocre before, and it appears to be mediocre after. Additionally, the English is abhorrently bad. Don't bother playing this unless you'd like to torture yourself-and not in a good way...A message to the devs:If you're gonna make a game, stick with the game. Improve it.Don't just change it into another game.And don't sell the prior game as DLC after. Include it, as it was the point of the original purchase.And please, use proper English. Hire a better translator, if it isn't your first language."

,Recommended,569760,29261623,Posted: 14 January,all,PeppaSmurf,"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=842569945THE GAME IS NOW IN FULL SCREEN!I can imagine someone who isn't scared to move every 2 seconds is able to complete this portion of the game very quickly (not in the hour it took us...).We wern't aware that it was essentially early access, I think it should definitely specify that on the steam store page.Aside from that, it was quite enjoyable to play, especially considering it's quite cheap. The horror is just jump scares, there's nothing more to it than that to be honest and there's not many of them either. I'm definitely looking forward to playing more though when more of it is released as I think it can be a promising game.The volume of the characters voices definitely need increasing though as it was set to the max volume in the games settings but it was still barely audible.Also please add brightness options as the game is a little bit too dark, I know it's a horror game but I still think it's required as some parts are impossible to see."

76561198137186270,Recommended,569760,29172907,Posted: 10 January,all,NetworkWorthy,This game definitely has the potential to be something big BUT they need to improve the brightness in the game first. I can see the point why they chose to set the scene very dark because it definitely helps with the atmosphere but it doesn't matter if you can't see anything throughout the game and don't know where you are or what you are doing.but still i would give it a 4.5/5check out the walkthrough that i made on this game here:https://youtu.be/q-78Ui3bya4
