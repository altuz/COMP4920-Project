,Recommended,569770,33706985,Posted: 21 July,all,DasMoss,"Its a pretty fun game but its early access does show. This game is a diamond in the rough, with a bit more polishing it will absolutely shine. The building is pretty simple and straight forward, making money is easy enough. Only things that bother me are as follows.1. Sometimes when you warp into a new system, you can warp into a bunch of mines. Ive had many encounters with pirates where I'll warp in and then get nailed by 1-2 mines, crippling me and allowing the pirate to finish me off. It seems extremely unfair and you will be praying every warp that you dont jump ontop of the North Korean DMZ.2. The friendly AI seems a little wonky. I can be kind of funny or frusterating. From the Friendly AI crashing into eachother and in a pit of road rage (space rage?) opening fire on everything that moves, To a friendly AI smashing into you. ( Not only do they crash into you, they BOOST once contact is made, WHAT?!)3. The combat can be weird. Various weapons have different firing arcs and varing turret rotation speeds. Also during combat it is not uncommon to miss the majority of your shots due to the weird way the game handles aiming in general.Despite those issues, the game is plenty of fun for a 5 dollar title. As long as the developer shows the game plenty of care the game has a good future."

Super addicting upgrading your ship amongst the different star systems towards the galactic center.Game is mature and very, very well made.  Of course some of the text can be polished in english but these devs really know what they're doing making this one.Adventure around in approx. 20 x 20 km star systems.  they include asteroids to mine from and enemy ships to fight against with the existing allies that help you, or shoot you if you shoot them too much, lol.Building your ship is outrageous, I mean, you start with simple hull structures, then make them into armor or introduce a plethera of weapons to choose from!  This is all happening when you are deciding where to install your thrusters! yes!YOU BUILD YOUR SHIP YOUR SHAPE, YOUR WAY!There are several diffent weapon types to choose from for placing onto ship, and repair guns for allies, energy, lighting, fuel tanks, balistic and laser guns - small and LARGE.You are in control of every single pixel that is made of your ship!Design your ship long/skinny to round, this game is so worth checking out.  If you have been following this one and are remotely interested, you have found a rare gem!For the price it is totally worth it guys, cheers!"

,Recommended,569770,34552900,Posted: 28 August,all,danielxancient,"Fantastic space building game!!!What I like about StarShip Constructor :* Freedom of building ( any shape you want)* Building mode accessible at any moment so you can adjust your ship any time you want.(change guns, add shield, etc,etc)* A lot of diferent weapon to choose from* You need to earn materials to be able to build bigger, better ship by mining or destroying ships.* You need to unlock modules to be able to build more complex ships.* Excellent animation and fx* Brilliant sound and background music.* Exploration* Trading* Fighting bogeys.* It is not all about building in this game, the main point is to be able to get to the center of Galaxy.What I would change in StarShip Constructor:- Skill tree ; I didn't notice any impact on gameplay, I was messing around with skills for a bit ( cos you're able to change skills as you play ) but haven't noticed any visible changes to a gameplay.- It glitches sometimes but it's Early Access at the end so I can live with that.Over all SSC gets 8/10."

Aaand I'm happy thus far. i know its still extemely early days for the game and there is a lot of work that still needs to go in like more weapons, more modules , more everything, but the expierence thus far is quite enjoyable . Highly recommend this game if you are into the whole grind and build model or just want something with the potential for more later on."

76561197969202706,Not Recommended,569770,33725223,Posted: 22 July,all,Fulby,"Looks promising but not enjoyable yet and very rough, both in terms of UI and gameplay. Sporadic bugs (some enemies don't take damage; after leaving a station you spawn kms away from it) and spelling mistakes on the main menu suggests it needs more attention to detail in its design and coding, rather than is just an early release."
76561198124260145,Recommended,569770,33844698,Posted: 27 July,all,Ant the Gord,"This review is being written very early in development, and with this developer's consistency with updates so far this game will likely go through a lot of revisions before more people can read this.This game has a good premise, slightly cartoony graphics (good for some, not so much for others like myself), fun mechanics, and oddly enough a fairly small learning curve considering the tutorial is fairly bad at getting you actually acquainted with the game. This isn't a huge gripe however because like I said before, it's easy to learn after a bit.The graphics and particles are of great quality and are splendid to watch.With the natural flow of updates and time, this game has the potential to be a great new space sandbox block constructor, it's a great foundation for a future amazing game. Definitely reccomend with the caveat that this is indeed VERY early in development and it shows."

76561198085231637,Recommended,569770,33711781,Posted: 21 July,all,pepperchestnut,"Issues I'm having.Tutorial works fine, freezes for about 10 seconds three or four times when you first enter the galaxy.Game stops working when you go into warp and the windows stopped working window pops up. But if you click wait until it responds, it starts working again right away.Could just be my worthless machine though.Other than that, I haven't noticed any bugs that weren't mentioned in the forums.This game is really cool, and has a lot potential to be a major success.Also, once all the bugs are woked out, this game has an even larger potential to become a huge success if it's made multi-player."
76561198212355595,Recommended,569770,33759618,Posted: 23 July,all,Satan,"Very fun, the only thing I have a problem with is that I'm constantly fighting the fact that there is no rotational deceleration that isn't input by the player. I.E. if you start to turn your ship, it will spin until you stop it, which unless you decide to sit in one spot makes flying difficult. Other than that its just an overall fun game."

,Not Recommended,569770,33674123,Posted: 20 July,all,Dave,"The game is a little ""too"" early access. Text in the game is clearly not translated properly. There needs to be way more tutorials before entering the game. Game feels like it's an MMO with other ships seeming to all be after your starter ship.There is no real balance between those ships and your starter ship.Compared to Cosmoteer (an itch.io title so far) this looks like something I could have written.Maybe later when the game goes out of Early Access, it might be better. Now however, nope."

76561197998964861,Recommended,569770,34902821,Posted: 12 September,all,Southern Wind,"UI and combat style is similar to SPAZ1 and Reassembly. It you like those games you probably like this game too. it is good game but short compare to SPAZ1, Reassembly. My play time is currently almost 8 hour and I have maximum size ship. Even I am on the level 2/5 sector. I reach to the maximum and unlock everything and have huge money. Is that because of the low price?Things need to be done list. Mostly UI improvements.1.Block size and block performance shoud be proporion. The performance is same regardless the size. So the smallest blocks are always the best. It minimize the change to be shot and maximize the armor and hull. All spec includes weight are same now.2.Need a key (ESC) to go back in the menu. Currently, you need to press the button with mouse respectively.3.Function to select multiple weapons and blocks.4.Maximum ship size limitation should be increased"

I enjoy the game and it is rather addictive, however there is much needed work.Although given its early access state, it is a stable EXE and is honestly worth 5$.Pros:Simple RetroSmall EXELarge array of componentsChallenging custimizationCons:Very poor translation.Construction can be clunky.Lack of clarification on statistics.Poor AI.Collisions are more deadly than combat.Developer Reccomendations:Correct AI trajectories. (Detect Collisions)Perhaps no clipping (Collisions), when there are other ships it can be impossible to fly away or fight without killing friendlies or yourself.Mining script should be optimized, causes minor lag.Drone command UI is a must.Hire a translator.Thanks SSCTEAM!Keep up the good work!"
