This is DLC.This is just theRIGHTend of the story.There's no huge world like we had before. There's no hidden items or puzzles.Just a bunch of new enemies that appears every second and new combat screen with torn clothes.But orphan finds the way to see his parents and finally join his lost friends. That's a pretty happy side of the story.For me, the game is overpriced as the2-hour-pressing-one-buttonexperience.Though it has collectibles, achievemets and couple of funny dialogs.It's just the tiny part of original inviolable game"
76561198054953841,Not Recommended,569970,30823005,Posted: 29 March,all,Vance Finiraldi,"To best sum this up, this is whatshouldhave been the previous game's final section/dungeon packaged as its own separate game... at an asking price of 2.5 times more than the original's.Okay, so to preface this, I wasn't coming in expecting high art. After all, I've slogged through the schlock that was the first ""Chosen"" game; I know what I should generally expect from this game as far as presentation is concerned. I bought this mainly to provide myself closure to the cliffhanger the last game ended off at. However, when you put out a completely linear experience that's even shorter than its predecessor and sell it at more than double the price, that's something worthy of being pointed out. Loudly.Aside from that, if you've played the prequel, then you have pretty much played this game, as it has almost of its mechanics, quirks, and issues. Generic RPG story, bland cast, basic RPG Maker battle system. At the very least, character portraits during conversation between the main characters are relatively ta-- oh wait, no.  There's gratuitous clothing damage to their portraits, which now appear in battle in lieu of their sprites, to compensate! This must be where the developer chose to invest what little ability they had to innovate, instead of using that effort to write a story that can stand on its own without the need to remember its predecessor's in detail. Bravo. /s (And before anyone even dares to counter this jab with a certain portion of my own game library, let me just say that most ofthosegames are upfront about who they're targeting.Thisgame, on the other hand, has these fan-service elements while trying -- and failing -- to be taken completely seriously.)Overall, this really isn't worth it at full price. Hell, it's hard to recommend this at any price even if you lower your standards a substantial amount. If you know what you're doing, you're going to breeze through this in just barely over an hour and feel as if you've had an incomplete experience. Which could have been mitigated by switching to the previous game's party every now and then while they're doing things of importance, but whatever. If you're really curious as to how the previous game's cliffhanger is resolved, then go for it... but I'd recommend you at least wait for a sale.P.S. To this RPG Maker game publishers that engage in this practice (including this one), please stop citing established JRPGs and series without context in order to drum up sales. That doesn't work. Never has and never will. Not without good writing or your own assets. Try to sell us your games on their own merits."

,Not Recommended,569970,32259170,Posted: 7 June,all,TheMauRisen,"I bought this game because it was on sale for 49ct and I played the first Chosen game. I wasn't expecting much and I wasn't suprised. There are only 3 bossfights, the final boss included and also a ""hidden"" boss which is not too much off a problem. The only real problem in this game is to fight the zombies although they drop a good amount of experience and gold they are just annoying to fight against. For the story it takes place after the events of the first Chosen game. That's about it. You try to get back to the real world and fight alongside your family while doing so. This game is even shorter than the previous game which would be okay, if the price wouldn't be 4,99€. Also the only time the enemies change is on the graveyard. So you just face the same enemies during the next 2 hours. Also most of them are weak to fire and are just weak in general and some of them, for example the zombies, are just too strong compared to the other enemies. In conclusion I would only suggest to buy this game on sale and if you played the previous Chosen game. It isn't worth the full price, as the game feels just like an expansion to the first game as former reviews stated already."

What can I say about this game? It's short, very, VERY super short. Like a lot of other reviews have said previously...this game mostly feels like some the ""true"" ending they forgot to add into the original game and was tacked on as DLC content.If you enjoyed the Chosen RPG (or Chosen 1) then I would pick this game up mostly just to witness the ""true"" ending for yourself."
76561197994272491,Recommended,569970,30955855,Posted: 4 April,all,forkless,"I do recommend this game, but absolutely only if you enjoyed the first one.If you haven't played the first game, buy that instead. If you didn't really like the first one, you're not going to like this one any better.Personally though, I did like the first one. These games are not deep at all, short, and very cliche. I think there's something refreshing to that though. It's nice to play something now and then that can be easily finished in an evening without a bunch of grinding and frustration. Not everything has to be a huge epic experience. Short, but fun can work too.The only issue here is that the original is $2 and this one is $5 when it's really just the final chapter of the first game rather than a new adventure. I don't mind that this is basically DLC for the first game, since I'm not sure how releasing DLC for a small RPG Maker game like this would even work, but the pricing is an odd choice. On the other hand, it's no secret that this game will go on sale for less than $1 (it's already happened), so complaining about the price is pretty pointless.If you liked the first one, just wait for a sale. It's an enjoyable experience in the same way the first one was and wraps up the story well enough."

I don't want to give too much away, because you get a nice amount of story and information within the first hour.-Turn based RPG.(Magic/Special Attacks/Weapons/Armor/Potions) The usual.-Armor/clothing tears after being damaged and repairs after healing.-Auto run (hold run to walk instead). (I thought that was a nice touch, no need to continually hold the run button like in most RPG's I've played.)-The story and concept is interesting enough.-You learn quite a few techniques and spells right off the bat.(An hour in and I'm level 11 and have quite a few spells and techniques.)-Combat with base enemies is intense right from the start. However, once you have your party it's pretty easy to spam Heal spells and not really struggle for a while.) Be sure to grind a bit and at least get Edge to Level 18 and the game shouldn't be much trouble.-It's a short game, so keep that in mind. Not as battle heavy as the first,but more of an end to the story.If you liked the first one then you'll probably enjoy this one too; at least I did anyway.It's basically a grand ending to the first one, but I really enjoyed it. You'll probably be more satisfied if you pick it up on sale rather than full price."
,Not Recommended,569970,35217571,Posted: 26 September,all,Terror_Cookie,"This game sucks.The story continues right after the first game and is built to reuse a lot of old assets(characters, maps, ...). I usually wouldn't mind about the story in general, but every character just acts unusual. It's not at all convincing how they act/react. An example:The loved one of the main character is in critical danger and is about to die. He just stands there. The question comes up what he's thinking about. An okay answer would be ""I'm unsure whether I did the right thing by killing our enemy,because she offered to save her."" oder even ""I could never tell her I loved her."" He says  ""I'm thinking of how useless I am."""" instead.However the gameplay itself is anything but great, too. The first monsters you encounter are pretty tough, so you might just level up a bit. After doing so for some minutes every fight for the next hour is pretty easy, but very annoying. You might eventually come to a point when you can buy stuff and quickly find out that you can buy a ""revive"" for 60 crystals, but sell it at 120g. This means that you can farm up some crystals for the only time you will actually buy something. The equipment you've just bought is better than almost anything you'll find later on in the game.The level/map design itself is built in a annoying way. Lots of mazes where you have to push boulders(it's not even a puzzle element, it's just pushing them forward a bit), holes and stairs with no purpose but to send you back a bit and checkpoints every two screens. However they are pointless, because you can heal yourself with potions/spells and save the game at any given time in the menu.The potions themselves are pretty weird, too. You start out with a few hundred hp per character and potions that heal 500hp. This is fine. At the absolute end of the game your main character might have about 800hp and you will have hi-potions that heal 2500hp and potions that ""heal your full health"".TLDR:The game clearly was not tested, is mostly annoying due to level design/boring fights and the story does not add a lot to the first game. Easy achievements, short game, not worth the 4,99€ by far. This might as well be a free add-on, but it still wouldn't be ""good""."

I already forgot what it was about.not even once did the story or the fighting draw me in, I played it on auto pilot and completed it in less then 2 HOURS.the women in this game where bikini plates as armor.. besides your ingame mother, she has a bit more armor but this doesnt make any sense and is just distastfull as they lose parts of their armor as they get more injured.also how do was penerate plate armore of this edge guy... that armor must be made from butterif this game was less the 1 euro then I would say pick it up if you want to play something short and decently ok but for 5 euro's I say move along and maybe wait for a big sale for its not worth the asking price.my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK-Wiqz8OSQ"

,Recommended,569970,31024985,Posted: 8 April,all,Lumina,"My hours in game are not representitive of how long the game actually is, I just grind a lot.The game is shorter than the first one which is a little dissapointing and there is not as much ""open area"" as the first one had but due to your location that is understandable and I will let it slide.If you have not played the first one than you should go and play that first, with how cheap it is you would be silly not to as the story follows on, if gives you a brief description on the past games events at the beginning but better to experiance it for yourself right.I wish the 3 ladies from the first one were in this game more but I would not say it was a negative that they were not; just my personal preference if they were, also found it really weird your parents look the same age as you.The battle system is similar to the first one except when it is the characters turn now their image appears on the screen quite big which took me a little while getting use to and the more damage your people take the more damaged their clothes get, nothing nude though (just thought I would throw that out there as people migh thave brought it expecting it) .The game had some good music in it which I will continue to listen to out of the game.A lot of people say what you get for the price is not worth it and it should have just been on the end of the first one as the proper end but for me personally the price is worth it, especially coming from the first one as the cliffhnger gets resolved, also as I said above the music is decent and can be found in the games local files so can be listened to outside the game and I would have paid the price just for the music as I enjoyed it.If you are coming in fresh and have not played the first one, than either buy the first one first than get this or if you do not want to buy the first one than wait till this one is in a sale because you would not find it worth the money.So I recommend it to anyone who has played the first one and recommend it to people who have not played it if it is in a sale."

While I have trouble calling this a separate / standalone game, I will call it addendum - since it provides a tidy conclusion to the original's cliffhanger. I thoroughly enjoyed the original game... not so much with this addendum! I would not recommend this on its own; only to follow The Chosen RPG.I was not a fan of the changes to the battle interface, but I did think that the character clothing getting torn when damaged was a neat feature."

While they have improved the gameplay in some areas, they have made it worse in others. Now, instead of getting sucked into battle every 3-5 seconds, prepare to get sucked into battle every 1/2 second-2 seconds. Think of Pokemon but instead of you hunting them... they're hunting you and incessently. The dialogue had more humor in this game while also adding some of the cheesiest dialogue I've heard in a while. The battle interface had some additions and improvements that were nice. The game is ~2hrs long. Although the games really could have been combined, I can't really fault the developers for splitting the game in two as I imagine it was done for financial reasons. There did seem to be a bug or a badly implemented game mechanic (cutting out abruptly while reading text) after defeating the final boss that gave me the final credit screen instead of the last part of the game and prevented me from getting the last achivement. I had to replay the final battle (and make sure Serenity didn't die during the battle) to be able to play the rest. I'd really only recommend this to someone who liked the first game or who doesn't like things to feel unfinished."

The story was more interesting, albeit harder to follow - although it's possible I wasn't paying as much attention and am more tired - and slower.  However, the combat improvements more than make up for it.  The lack of a completely overpowered stun which works even on bosses makes it MUCH more balanced, and the party layout is also more traditional - 2 fighters, a mage, and a healer.  Bosses do a lot more damage, but unfortunately, have MUCH less HP than in Chosen 1.  As such, they remain pushovers, which is truly a loss, because this game could have had some interesting boss fights.  Altogether, this is a MASSIVE improvement over the first installment; I was extremely skeptical after the ""To be continued..."" but boy, I wasn't disappointed.Play this for closure if you've played the first one.  It's much, much better and more enjoyable.  However, to newcomers of the series - I'd still recommend some other RPG.  However, for as cheap as this one is, if you want to save your cash - try it out.  It's pretty decent.EDIT: Additionally, the girls undress as they take damage.  And they're cute.

This entire game takes place right after the end of the first game as you Edge 'the chosen one' have to escape from the Underworld with the help of your dead mother, and father, and this girl that feels like a secretary.   This game is woefully shorter than the first, has even less combat, there is hardly any reward for exploring (there's like 2 side paths in the entire game leading to treasure equivalent to what you can buy in the shop), and the final boss is just blugh.The finale was the least impactful I've ever seen mainly due to the characters not having much development since the first game, and due to the length of time before the previous entry and this one I forgot who all these people were.  Plus the finale you don't even get a chance to re equip your new characters before the final boss, in which kills your entire party in 2 attacks and since you don't have a healer anymore you will be constantly tossing healing items hoping that edge can perform his super move 3 times due to how overpowered it is.And the worst part is after the 3 form final boss (which isn't needed due to how bad this game is) there's a big long scene, and then a text scroll, after the text scroll something is coded wrong CAUSING AN IMMEDIATE GAME OVER!
