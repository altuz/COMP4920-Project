I never really thought about the idea of having VR music videos but you seriously owe it to yourself to try this out.  My 7 year old daughter danced her little butt off to this 4 times in a row, she absolutely loves it!  It's so silly, fun, and the aesthetic and art style works so well.  Please make more of these!!Feel free to watch me get silly in my quick review of Old Friend!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=838278154"

It's colorful with a good song and with stuff going on everywhere. I will admit it's not very interactive, you just control the hands and the the wobbly arms attached to them. I'll also say it's kind of short, but it's also only $3. I was smiling by the end of it both times I've watched it so far, totally worth $3 to me.Also I hate to dance, but this made me dance a little. Well jiggle. Whatever. Shut up."

It's basically a VR music video but you do get your own pair of visible arms and legs so you can see yourself groove to the music. It's very colorful, fun, and happy. Those naked Elmers seem to be genuinely trying to make you smile so perhaps it's something that can be used to boost up my mood when I'm feeling down."

Have watched it many times so far, the song is great, the animation is fantastic, and I keep finding little things I didn't notice before (for example...spoiler... the clouds change their facial expressions depending on if you are looking at them or not. )Overall it is simple, just a music video with minimal interaction, but it is funny, psychadelic, and just plain weird in a good way. Would recommend for the price. :)"
,Recommended,570000,28652978,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Dknighter,CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS ENOUGH!!!!This is beyond perfect for a music video. I was sad when it ended so I rewatched it 3 more times :D It's great!I will definitely go and rewatch this a few more times and show this to everyone I can. There is some interaction as well with the amazingly well done arms and clouds! 100% worth paying for!
,Recommended,570000,30891152,Posted: 1 April,all,ogresav,"Old Friend affects the brain by increasing the activity of at least three neurotransmitters (the chemical messengers of brain cells): serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Like other amphetamines, Old Friend causes these neurotransmitters to be released from their storage sites in neurons, resulting in increased neurotransmitter activity. Compared to other potent stimulants, Old Friend causes greater serotonin release and somewhat lesser dopamine release. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in the regulation of mood, sleep, pain, appetite, and other behaviors. The excess release of serotonin by Old Friend likely causes the mood elevating effects experienced by Old Friend players. However, by releasing large amounts of serotonin, Old Friend causes the brain to become significantly depleted of this important neurotransmitter, contributing to the negative behavioral aftereffects that players often experience for several days after watching Old Friend."

What's not to love?The only problem with it is that I was having so much fun that I was sad when it ended.Also, did I mention that you have noodle arms?

Got this as part of a bundle and saw a 100% positive review for it.If you like to dance in VR to a silly song with interesting graphics and the ability to see your arms and legs move, let me tell you, this is the game for you. I can well imagine if your showing this off to your 5 year old, its literally hours of fun for them.If however you are an adult who does not particularly like dancing to silly songs. Then you just wasted your money. No replayability, no scoring system, no variation in the experience if you're dancing your♥♥♥♥♥off to stood still.Certainly some props to be given for a new way to use VR and I haven't seen anything else like it, but as an experience, it's 3 minutes then uninstall."

,Recommended,570000,30470215,Posted: 12 March,all,Gnathonic,"This can evoke joy in most people and will even cause sourpusses to bust out in dance. Until the remember they are being watched.If happiness lasts for more than a few hours, see your doctor.Details:It's essentially a music video with some interactive elements and a lot of content packed into 3 minutes. The dancers will bat you away if you try to interfere with their dance routine. The clouds and mountains will get super happy if you look at them. When the big head shows up it will follow your view so you can't miss it. During the free dancing segments each dancer has a unique (community submitted) silly dance. So you'll have to watch it a few times if you want to see all of them.Since you aren't just a viewer, but rather somewhat of a participant, the emotional response is far more punchy than what a normal music video can achieve. Everything is just overflowing with joy and it's infectious."
