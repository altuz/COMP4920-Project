76561198086016572,Recommended,570860,29056513,Posted: 6 January,all,Morgan Freeman,"TL;DR: Get this game. Support its developers. We need more of this. It's an amazing concept for only 10 dollars, and this could seriously grow into a hit.Long Version: Okay, don't let the broken english of the description send you away from this game. This game is exactly like the Drums from Rock Band, with an amazing arcade style vibe, and already some really catchy tunes.Pros:Absolutely great concept. I would play this for hours trying to get a high score.Amazing aesthetic and design choice.Great song choice for first 6 songs.Cons:Needs more songs. (Currently only 6)Steam Workshop support. With a good mapping tool, this game could make itself within the community.(opinion) Color code the 4 hit bars. It would make realizing what notw is coming down which lane a lot easier, without disparaging the difficulty.This game absolutely gets my support, and I can only see this concept getting better."

Pop'n?This review is aimed at you - because I am, I'm a super-diehard Bemani fan from back in the 5-key days on.I was a bit skeptical about how the lack of feedback would be with the Vive wands, as I am the type to put Sanwas in my RED ASC... but I was pleasantly surprised - this actually plays very well. There are a range of interesting note types beyond just impact. You have directional flick arrows - which are very satisfying, and you also have the classic hold note... except it pulls an SDVX - on tougher notecharts, the hold notes may move and zig-zag in an SDVX kinda way. Of course. there are also chords.To the most important stuff: the timing and combo structure work exactly like you would expect from a true Bemani game, and the grading system also fits the mold. The difficulty is, in true Bemani style, divided into three tiers - with individual notecharts having number ratings from 1-15.I got a B on the hardest chart in the game after only 10 minutes of play or so... so this isn't the toughest thing ever - but it's the most difficult rhythm game for VR at the moment. The difficulty splits well across the three tiers - the number determines intensity, while moving up through the tiers increases complexity/technique, in a way that feels right for a Bemani style game. I would compare a level 15 track on the highest difficulty tier to roughly an H6 or H7 in IIDX, and maybe an H11 in SDVX, somewhere around then. It may not go as high as you'd like, but it's certainly high enough to give you that Bemani feeling, that combo-trance.The notecharts themselvesdefinitelyfeel in line with the Bemani style, they line up with the music in the same ways as you'd expect, and have the same consistency and flair. They do depart from just being drums - while most notes are in line with the drum track, the hold notes and arrow flairs in particular often line up with synths, effect sweeps, and oneshots. On which note, there are unfortunately no keysounds. It would bemuchbetter with keysounds... but I don't find that a dealbreaker here, and I'm usually a keysound junkie.While as of this review there are only six tracks, it's only six bucks - and the tracks are good - each with three notecharts, and it seems clear they'll be adding more music. If you're into Bemani, and like me you've been searching for the VR rhythm game thatproperlyscratches that itch, this is something you want to be supporting. It's out of China, not the west, and it feels like it. It's still a bit low on content and could use an in-play score counter, but these are early days, and the fun is there.Verdict: Highly, highly reccommend for existing Bemani fans. If you are not familiar with Bemani, expect a steeper difficulty slope and higher difficulty ceiling than you might get from western VR rhythm games - and to perhaps be disappointed by the six Chinese indie-electronica/rock tracks on offer."

I can barely manage B on easy, my parents would run away after just watching my attempts.It's bursting with quality and consideration, this isn't another quick 'we got an algorithm so you can put your controls in the right spot at the right time to match beats' game. There's engaging unique mechanics like arrows that appear where you have to hit the beat and then swerve the controller in the arrows direction, and super neat touches like a character popping up when you reach any hundred combo.The imagery is very nice and distinctive, though I'd like there to be some additional indication like a bit of a glow/etc when it's the best time to hit the beat.Additionally its very responsive and I didn't notice any accidental double hit/miss etc as a result of the 3D space, though I could barely keep up with the rhythm so I might have missed that.Even though I'm not able to meet the difficulty this game presents, there's no way I'd refund this as it definitely deserves the asking price as long as they hopefully deliver more songs not locked into expensive DLC etc and refine the experience a bit, even if it is already almost polished to perfection.A terrific experience if you're up for it, great job developers."

,Recommended,570860,30133205,Posted: 23 February,all,Scavenge,"Based on a very short play, i like it.  It's fairly priced and pretty well done.Is it gonna blow your mind?  No.  It still needs a few things, but it's pretty good as it is.  I can only assume that it's one dude developing the game so you can't expect a huge amount of content.It's a little focused on (i believe) Korean pop music.  Could use more blends of other music genre's.Also really, REALLY needs some haptic feedback when you're hitting notes.  It'd make it so much more satisfying to hit the notes (hopefully that comes soon, now that Valve is pretty much opening up everything on the Steamvr platform).  Otherwise, nailing long rolls with directional flicks, multi-taps, and quick segments feels very rewarding and in-tune with the music.  I also had originally thought that the game had the same problem as guitar hero and a lot of the other rythym games (i.e. the ""notes"" are always very SLIGHTLY off time and it drives me nuts), but i quickly realized that you don't, and shouldn't, hit the notes -right- when they get into your indicator.  If you hit them ON-BEAT with the song, it most often gives perfect hits.  Kudos on that.All in all, it's worth your time and money.  Particularly if you're looking for those VR titles to pull out at small parties/gatherings.  Again, though, don't expect a whole lot of content."
76561197968496198,Recommended,570860,29081752,Posted: 7 January,all,Zaptruder,"AudioBeats is as polished as any typical non-VR release*.*there are some spelling mistakes (or are they?) in there that brings down the professionalism of the game as an english release - such as; ""Original Cracks 1"" instead of 'Original Tracks, Vol. 1' - but that's just been nitpicky, and is a largely forgiveable flaw given the current small state of the market meaning it's often difficult to justify additional professional translation expenses.Currently features 6 tracks and 3 difficulties for each. Pleasant asian pop music (the game is made by a chinese developer).The beats are hand crafted (which is a vitally important point of difference from more procedurally oriented beat/rhythm games) allowing the gameplay to be a lot more interesting and dynamic feeling (as in the transitions between each beat feel a lot more interesting and challenging).The only flaw is not really its fault - it's the lack of tactile feedback. I found that while standing, I'd slowly drift downwards as the game got more and more intense, so I had to pull up a chair which allowed me to be more consistent.It is a fairly hard game though... difficult ramps up quickly, and by the end of the first song on basic mode, you're already approaching the difficulty level found on moderate hard songs in medium to hard difficulty in Rockband/Guitar Hero (although it's been a while since I played those games).If you like asian music, or even if you dont' mind it and you're a fan of the rhythm music genre this one is for you."

76561198031749349,Recommended,570860,29313167,Posted: 17 January,all,Lord of the Stack,"Great game. One of the most unique techniques I've seen for a music game.What I mean is, there is a great deal of variety in the way you must respond to the beats.We are all familiar with hitting beats, check.We are all familiar with holding a long beat, check.But wait, sometimes those long beats MOVE! yeah, u have to move your controller to follow it while still hitting other beatsThere are also linked beats (two hits at the exact same time).And my absolute favourite, 'cast' beats. u have to hit the beat, it attaches to your controller and you have to 'cast it away' ie fling it a certain direction (if the beat is a left arrow u hit it then flick ur controller left). It adds so much flare to the game.You truly feel awesome when you nail a song in this game. It is really on the same level as DDR or other very mainstream music games.I only have 3 criticisms for this game.1. Only 6 songs available, and it is not clear if they are adding more to this version or not.2. No steam leaderboards (highscores). I like the challenge of trying to improve my rank, which this lacks3. The 4 drums really should be colour coded, sometimes it's hard to tell if notes are top row or bottom row until they get really closeKeep your eye on this game, it could be the breakaway winner of the vr music genre"
76561198058602281,Recommended,570860,29179905,Posted: 11 January,all,Controversy,"Looks great.  Plays great.The only issue is that there are only 6 songs.   The other VR music games allow you to play any song on Youtube, so that would be a good addition to the game."

76561198204798857,Recommended,570860,29257864,Posted: 14 January,all,Count Jelqula,"Got it on sale and glad I did. I never really got into (or tried) many rythm games, yet it's one of only a few games I have gone back to after the first try on the Vive.I am pretty bad at it, as the commands become overwhelming even on easy for 5 out of the 6 tracks. I'm sure (at least I think) that if I keep at it, I will improve.One thing obviously lacking is the tactile response of actually hitting the drums or whatever they are. That's just a limitation of VR, though, and I don't hold it against the title especially considering the price. If someone was willing, it wouldn't be too hard to set up some real-life props to correlate to the drums!I enjoy the artwork, just wish there was even more crazy stuff popping up besides the chick at every 100-combo interval- even if it probably would take my attention away from the commands. I also like the songs especially the darker sounding ones with hints of dubstep in them."

It's got the look, the sequeces, the tracks.  But it's really too frustrating to play the way it is now.  It's such a tease because you want it to be good,  but ultimately feels like you're playing a broken game."
,Recommended,570860,29067387,Posted: 6 January,all,FancyPants,Fun game! Reminded me a lot of the Japanese rhythm arcade games. I didn't recognize any of the songs but they are catchy and fun to play. The game offers many different levels of difficulty so people new to rhythm games should be able to pick it up fairly quickly and veterans can get a real challenge. Some improvements would be more songs and better feedback if a note is hit or missed.
,Not Recommended,570860,30578775,Posted: 17 March,all,⎛⎝Duckers⎠⎞,"It has a really good promise, but i feel it lacks higher drums as when it adjusts to your height,  you can't see the drums unless you crouch a bit. Plus since the drums are very close to eachother, i then can't get a good score cause i then end up hitting the other which cancels the combo.and what would make it easier is to hear each drum, aswell as a force feedback in the controllers when i hit the drums.I like the game for what it is, but those small details makes me not able to recommend it as i struggled to hit the right drum  or managed to hit 2 at once because of how close  they are and not being able to see them when standing up straight and looking at the highway of the dots.."

,Not Recommended,570860,29164746,Posted: 10 January,all,Kris.vdv,"This game is well produced featuring an excellent UI and the environment and drums all look good.But to be honest, don't buy this game if you are over 30 :).  I think it's more suited for teens with very fast reflexes. It makes Audio Shield feel like a game for the elderly. ;)  Even the tutorial was too fast for me.Also, I don't think you'll like the music if you're over 30.  ;)"

76561198027151743,Recommended,570860,29125821,Posted: 8 January,all,Joiemoie,"The mechanics are nice. A suggestion I would have is to have an option to put all the 4 notes on the same horizontal level, rather than having the two side buttons elevated. Because the relative positioning of notes is very important to timing, having the two side buttons be on different levels is very confusing."

,Recommended,570860,29084908,Posted: 7 January,all,IronPanda,"I was a bit wary about this game after seeing comments about how difficult it was, not the most co-ordinated and  suspect my reflexes aren't as sharp as they used to be. Worrying too was that not only do you have to hit one of four drum pads correctly in time to incoming 'beats' but some you have to hold and even 'flick' in the direction of the arrow.First effort and i was scoring 'B' (on easy level) for the songs i tried, no doubt i'd crash and burn on harder levels but it's fun. Different enough to Music Inside, Holodance and Happy Drummer to make Audio Beats a buy.Pros:+Price, $6 at the moment!+Crisp visuals+Only 6 tracks at the moment but they're well matched and have a good beat.+You have to really concentrate but it's not a great deal harder than similar games of its type.+not a big download and doesn't hang on exit.Cons:-There's a decent enough hit area but if you move you'll start to miss. It's not like Music Inside where you're watching the drum set itself - you're attention is more occupied by the incoming notes.-no leaderboards  (yeah, i can dream...)Rating: 9/10"
,Recommended,570860,29177449,Posted: 10 January,all,Necroburn,"7/10  now, 10/10 with updates.This game has HUGE potential. Each song is captivating and has the different ways hit the notes are engaging. There is 3 mechanics to the game: Hitting the notes like a regular drum, Blocking the notes in the form of a moving laser beam continually as a run-on note, and directional hits that you must hit the pad(s) in a direction to not miss the note.If they added maybe one ore two more ways to score such as star mode, combo hits, or some kind of drum solo mode it would have enough features to last into 2nd or 3rd VR generationsIt has only 6 songs at the moment, but I got it on sale for $6 so as long as it has updates for more songs I will be very happy with my purchase andrecommend it to all VR owners."
