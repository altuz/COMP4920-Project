,Recommended,570970,34980220,Posted: 15 September,all,Dimension Five,"Another culturally insensitive masterpiece from Crian Soft.  It's a pretty basic fighting game with entertaining mini-adventures between fights.  You might be running from a boulder ala Indiana Jones, dodging swinging blades, or a number of other events that can all lead to a quick, brutal, and hilarious end.  Then it's right back into another fight.  These little diversions really do help to keep repetition from setting in.Combat is similar but different enough from Age of Barbarian to make this game feel different, but still close enough to keep the two games feeling linked.This is a game that will entertain the right audience wonderfully.  People outside of that niche likely won't see the fun though.  Like its glorious predecessor Age of Barbarian - if you're a fan of 80's barbarian movies - you'll no doubt get a great many smiles and laughs from Arena."

The stage exploration seems to be gone, and the game takes a more linear arcade style path. Fun mini stages between arena battles help keep things interesting. Also 3 new characters to play as!AoB always reminded me of the ""Barbarian"" games of the classic 8 bit computer era, and this installation even moreso!"
,Recommended,570970,35038123,Posted: 17 September,all,Robert Stack,"Like the previous installment this game pays homage and tribute to the classic genre of sword and sorcery style movies and games of the late 70's/80's. Criantsoft is what seems to be a small but dedicated outlet for this venue who regarldless of realease mishaps, botches and patches. Aims to deliver exactly waht is described above!If you are a fan of Frazetta and Boris Vallejo art as well as movies such Barbarella. Conan and Hurcules of the 80s and especially a fan of the orgininal Barbarian Series. Then this game is up your alley is and a worthwhile play. In this installment Crian Soft devilvers a delightfully tacky and appealing sword and sorcery game for those who enjoy the concepts of primitive fantasy, scantily clad heroines, beef cake barbaric hunks, and evil sorcerers who aim to stifle the player every step of the way.The game is challenging, the developer is responsive, and the game is a fun challenge for those who enjoy a classic side scrolling beat em up with heros and enemies who wish to stain the floors and walls with the crimson red blood within our bodies!"

It does seem to have launched with a few problems.First off, the uncensor option doesn't work, so prepare to see strange ovals with pixels all over the place no matter your settings.Second, there are several glitches and crashes.  I was disembowled by a panther and the whole game stopped working and I kept getting run.exe errors.Still, I think it COULD be awesome.  Let's see what the patches bring."

Pretty much what you expect when you are getting an AoB game.Still some bugs, which hopefully they will fix, but nothing game breaking.Definitely a more ""pick up and play"" cousin to the AoB game already on here."

76561197970738041,Recommended,570970,35089172,Posted: 20 September,all,Batty,"This is the arcade game that should have been made but never was.  It plays, looks and feels so much like an old game that I could believe Crian Soft found a lost prototype and ported it to PC.The perfectly realized genre glory from the first Age of Barbarian returns in Arena as does the utter and shameless disregard for political correctness.  Arena is a smaller game and priced accordingly.Importantly, Sheyna is back.Buy it before the SJWs ban it."

76561198009213925,Recommended,570970,35222659,Posted: 26 September,all,Sblade,"I would like some of the old negative reviews to comeback and edit because they speak about fixed issues in just a few days.This original game that transport us back to the 80´s ""conan the barbarian"" era, has quite skilled and polished combat system, has mini games that you have to learn, and has difficulty levels for those who want to be spanked.In short, a very good game for an indie developer with small team, lot of core issues has been fixed and it would be fair if some of the reviewers edit their one, specially the day 1 players.Have nice day folks"
76561197968302047,Recommended,570970,34982930,Posted: 15 September,all,skunk ghoti,"If you enjoyed Crian Soft's previous release, Age of Barbarian, then I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this game to you. It's a great continuation of the ideas in that game, and while it can seem pretty tough at first, in part due to the minimal explanation of new game mechanics (and that ""Barbarian Brothers"" inspired battle will frustrate the button-mashers out there), once you get a handle on things it becomes a hell of a lot of fun. Yes, there are certainly some bugs at the moment, but Crian Soft have shown a serious dedication to their games in the past that puts most other developers to shame, so I have no doubt that these will be fixed soon enough.For the uninitiated, I'm genuinely torn between recommending Arena or the original Age of Barbarian; Age of Barbarian has some light rpg elements (you increase character health and unlock moves as you progress) and a gentler difficulty curve, despite being a really tough game in places - like some of those optional boss battles (the Basilisk still gives me nightmares) - but Arena is cheaper in price, has a better character selection, and a greater variety in terms of gameplay styles. At the end of the day, if you like the look of the trailers then you'll likely be happy with either game, particularly if you remember the 8-bit Barbarian games from the 80's, or have a soft-spot for those cheesy 80's barbarian movies. And if not, there's always Steam refunds. Oh, and the Arena theme song is made of purest awesome :)"

I am sure I can safely review this game quite well, so here are my pros, cons and misc.Pros:-Quite a bit of humour-Surprisingly not too sloppy controls-Not too difficult moveset-B movie effects and gimmicks-Decent musicCons:-Bugs, bugs gallons of the stuff (Still got that sabertooth tiger bug and others)-Occasionally unresponsive controls-Grammar errors and spelling problems-unbalancedMisc:-Blood! Gore! Boobies! Magic!-I will rip your heart out!-Khaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan!-Stop runing my meat sack!-My middlefinger salutes you!-Controller recommendedFinal note:This is not a game for everyone, this is more for those with very specific tastes on cheesy b-movies and violence... Do I recommend it, in a way, yes. Yes it is enjoyable, though I know of some people who can be annoyed by the minigames and I can perfectly understand them on that point. This is not a game for graphics or voice acting."

Problem I've encountered are PvP mode doesn't work due to controller issue hope they fix it. And the uncensor doesn't work after completing with Mobata, I hope they fix this too. Game play is entertainingly chalenging in simplicity if your a fan of Heavy Metal Fantasy GET THIS GAME!!!Crain Soft, please fix the PC version PvP. There is no P2 controller config."

It really takes away from your character models. Why hide your artwork under that filter. Thats my two cents, keep up the good work Crian Soft."

Sadly even though this game looks as if it would have build on the basic gameplay from that, it seems to be one big bug. unresponsive controls, enemies who can hit you while you are dodging are among the issues that make this not only not un, but also plain not playable.I hope the devs manage to fix it."

Sadly Arena is too linear of an experience for me, and while AoB was no storytelling masterpiece each level had its own mini-story and unique environment. Don't get me wrong I enjoy the over-the-top bloodletting, but I do like my barbarians with a little bit more purpose.For now, I will just replay AoB and beat that damn dragon..."

I have no idea what I'm doing wrong - if I'm doing anythign wrong - but this game is just not working for me. A shame."
,Not Recommended,570970,34983513,Posted: 15 September,all,Pozhinateli,Game theme is great. Combat is fun.But:- tons of bugs- annoying mini games- it is called arena but can not set own matches. There should be custom fight option where player can chose how many enemies fight and with ones.- beside 1v1 and story filed with annoying minigames no other modes.- uncensor options does not work.- No characters screams from previous release.
