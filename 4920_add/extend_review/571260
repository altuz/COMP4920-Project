,Recommended,571260,32750108,Posted: 24 June,all,S C O O T I S,"Great port of a great game. Runs like an absolute dream on my mid-level rig and it has all the features you've seen on the PS4 version on top of the configuration options you'd expect a PC game to have.However, SNK's curse of poor netcode remains. Online is absolutely TERRIBLE. It's about as choppy as the PS4 version if not worse in most instances. I could barely play a match without stutter or high input delay and this was with people who were as close as possible to me.Netcode issues aside, King of Fighters XIV is an outstanding game. Loaded with a huge variety of both returning and brand new characters, a renewed MAX system that combines elements from KOF13's HD/Super meter into one, all the while maintaining the series mainstay mechanics such as rolling and blowback attacks. It's a fantastic experience and there is a lot to dive into that can keep you busy.I highly recommend this game for local play as it's one of the best fighting games out there right now and a must own for anyone who is a fighting game fan. However, in regards to online play, do not put money down for this if you're planning to play online until a patch comes out to optimize the netcode."

You've got a proper ten stage story/arcade mod, as well as survivor and time attack modes. And it has a gallery to gradually unlock. Visually, the game boasts passable PS3/360 era graphics, falling somewhere between Dead or Alive's pleasing aesthetics, and Street Fighter 4's stylized flashiness. Sound assets are quite good too, with some memorable stage themes. I can't rate the voice over work, because it's Japanese, and there's an unwritten rule to assume that ALL japanese voice over work is top notch. (real talk, the last KOF I played that was dubbed was maximum impact, and well........ I want to forget that maximum impact ever happened. And I also hear that KOF 12's dub was genuinely horrible)It's a great package offline, but unless you live in Japan or the States, forget about it, as the netcode can't handle long distances. Also, I'm convinced I'm the only person in Australia that bought the game......"
,Recommended,571260,32444917,Posted: 15 June,all,wyulf,"i've been playing the kof series since it's inception, back in 94. i've always been a fan, and i bought all the games, through the playstation(s) era, all the way up to kofxiii; and i've spent hundreds of hours on kofxiii alone on my ps3.kof has always been known for it's nice 2d art, and it was epitomised in kofxii, with a reset in the art department; big characters, all beautifully hand drawn. while i did play kofxii a bit (not much to be honest), it felt like an incomplete game. still, the new system was fun, and had me looking forward to kofxiii ... and snk delivered. kofxiii was not only beautiful, it was a great game too.fast forward to kofxiv. when kofxiv launched on the ps4, i was almost tempted to buy a ps4, and a new stick, just for that ... but i stopped short right there. why? the graphics, was a bit of a turn off. snk had decided to shift to 3d instead, and those who have played the maximum impact series would know, snk isnt really all that great at 3d. that stopped me dead in my tracks, and for a long while, i had kept contemplating if i should actually splurge on a ps4+stick+kof because that would cost me a chunk of money.so eventually, snk released kofxiv, here, on steam and i thought ... ok, now i have a stick that works fine on pc, and i dont need to buy a new console, so why not~ and thus i plonked down the money for the pre-order/closed beta session ... and ended up spending a ton of time on it as well.what i'm trying to say really, is that while kof have (regretably) shifted from 2d to 3d in the latest reiteration in the series, it's still a really great fighter. of course, the change of system almost necessitated a change of the combat (albeit, only slightly), but it plays and feels very much like the kof of old (not old old, but the advent of the 'max mode' first introduced in kof99, evolved to much of what we know now in kof2k2, leading into the more elaborate combo strings of kofxiii). over time, it's easy to overlook and forget about the 3d-ness of the game. in fact, comparitively, since snk released the new shaders, kofxiv has looked much better since the launch back then.more importantly, i've tested online play (primarily in closed beta), i guess it goes almost without saying that it's smooth and without problems when playing with people nearby (e.g. same country), but gets bit laggier for longer distances. you would have to keep in mind that the latency where i'm from isnt all that great, so it's probably much harder for me to call this aspect accurately; although when i was playing it with my friends (within the same country), it was all fine and dandy, went smoothly without any hitches at all.so yea, as a summary of sorts, graphically, it's not too shabby afterall; but the main ingredients of the game, which is the battles, and the system, is still a great joy, and still brings great fun. not as tough to pick up as a newcomer (as opposed to the guilty gear series), and plenty to learn and master if you want to be competitive. online play is also fairly good for me at least, and being the latest iteration of the game (as of posting at least), there'd be plenty of fights to pick online too.do pick it up, especially if you're an old kof fan, who was skeptical about the graphical direction of this. you wont even notice it as much once the battles heat up."

Shame about the graphics though...KOF IV is a very good game with the full roster available immediately on start-up unlike some other game *kof*kof*SFV*kof*kof* (yes pun definitely intended). It has all of the modes you'd come to expect (again unlike some other game), the classic KOF game play with some new tweaks, better online net code, basically it's everything a great fighting game should be. Overall it's a great game, too bad the onscreen graphics looked like they were lifted from the PS2 Maximum Impact series. if they only retained the KOF XIII art style...I’ll make this review short, KOF XIV is a great addition to the long running fighting series, the graphics are outdated, but that can be overlooked, the soundtracks and the sound effects are once again impressive (seriously listen to these footsteps) the game play is fast and fun, this is a complete game out of the box so you will spend a lot of time unlocking materials in the gallery section unlike another fighting game that came out recently that didn’t have the basic.Conclusion:Graphic always not a first place for a fighting game, however balancing, system, story as well as in game content can make fan or newcomer satified to buy.KOF 14; yes,reach the requiement mention above."

The combos all feel really fluid and finding new ways to chain them together is always a blast. You can spend literally hours just messing around with them in practice mode. As far as different modes go, this game has quite a few of them. Arcade, vs., Survival Etc. Enough to keep you busy for a while. Everything you'd expect to see in a good fighting game is here, and if you were a fan of previous KOF entries, i'm sure you'll enjoy this one as well."

However, the developer behind this port job Abstraction Games did a terrible job here.This game had a closed beta (only available if you pre-ordered to sucker you in) that lasted a little over 3 weeks until the game was officially released. And all of the issues I'm about to list were present during the beta and absolutely nothing was done to fix these issues:NETPLAY IS VERY HIT AND MISS. Sometimes you find a great connection and sometimes you don't. This is because the idiot developers at Abstraction decided not only to not add Ping numbers and replace the incredibly inferior bar system for network quality. But even in a good connection it will lag on occasion. Which is unacceptable.THE BARS DETERMINING NETWORK QUALITY ARE WILDLY INACCURATE. You could play someone at 4 bars and the connection is unplayable. Underwater. But you could play someone at 2 bars and it's fantastic.THERE'S SCREEN TEARING. The only way to maybe fix it is adjust the settings on your video card and hope that fixes it. As for me it didn't and it's very distracting. Screen tearing happens during pretty much any movement from characters.OTHER BUGS AND ISSUES. The game might lock up on you. It still might crash. I've had it happen twice tonight where it didn't recognize my keyboard at all and I had to hit the Windows key and select the game for it to recognize the keyboard again. Other's have been reporting that the game doesn't even launch for them.Abstraction Games chose not to listen to customers and these are the consequences. Online is pretty dead right now if you live in North America. I implore SNK to not re-hire Abstraction Games again and do their PC port jobs in-house. I honestly think Dot Emu could have done a better job (yeah, I went there). Because I was watching Steam Database for this game during the beta and saw maybe 1 person in-game (for the Steam edition not the closed Beta). And Abstraction didn't work on weekends either. It wasn't until the last 7 or so days until release Abstraction added more people to work on the port.And you know what they did instead of fixing all of the issues customers had? They added support for obscure controllers and joysticks instead. Get your Sega Saturn pads ready. Abstraction and one of the reps from SNK have yet to address any of these issues that should have been fixed during the beta.Stick to Tekken 7 guys until this port is fixed. And Abstraction Games has personally been added to my Crap List."

The graphics aren't great, but they do the job. The netcode on the Steam version is quite commendable, better than the console version. Has story mode, many online modes including online training mode (!) and a fairly robust tutorial. TBH it's a much better value than SFV, just gets overlooked a lot. One thing I will add is that there is this myth that KoF is hardcore or the learning curve is steep -- it really isn't."

I missed some old faces here though. Here you have 50 characters to choose from. 4 additionals if you get DX edition which imo is totally worth it.* It has a tutorial which is much appreciated nowadays.* Many modes, online and offline, such as tournament, practice mode, lobbies, etc.* Character designs are nice, better than kofxiii, with some details that could anyway be improved (a few extremely thin/childish characters which was also a problem in kofxiii).I totally recommend this game, the only cons I may find here is that this game has a feral and savage competence here. (Inj2-Tk7-MVCI-SFV-MKX, etc) that could make ppl to not give it the proper attention. Never ever have been SO MANY AAA FGs at the same time.Nevertheless you may find this game totally joyful, give it a try and find friends to enjoy it.I am a big fan of kof 2002 and this game while still lacking some key characters to me (New Faces Team) still must be given a chance. Don't hesitate and get it :)"
76561198032507845,Recommended,571260,32462578,Posted: 15 June,all,Towerbooks3192,"Solid fighter containing staple features such as arcade,survival, time trials, versus, etc. The roster is huge and there is a huge variety of characters to choose from. The roster goes to 50 characters (54 when deluxe is purchased) so you have no shortage of fighters to pick.Traditional KoF matches are 3v3 where you pick a team 3 fighters and a round ends when one fighter is knocked out. You can't tag in like other games rather the fighter you picked in order will replace the fallen one and the round resets. HP of the surviving fighter will be carried over to the next round only recovering a bit depending on the remaining time from the previous round. The meters are carried over from round to round and shared between your team. This is what made KoF great. You need to put careful consideration in picking your fighters and the order that they will be fighting. You can use canon teams or just mix and match.Mechanics-wise KoF is deep and satisfying. You got emergency escapes (rolls), varying jumps, and the super/advance/climax cancels. It is hard for me to explain these since I am fairly new in terms of really analyzing the mechanics in KoF despite playing for some time but the game does a good job in teaching you the basics of these mechanics.One of the biggest ""issue"" that most people seem to have is the jump from sprites to 3D. I personally prefer the sprites and still find ones from Garou or 2002UM, heck even 98UM still looks beautiful.I am a bit biased but that doesn't necessarily mean the graphics are horrible. By today's standards it doesn't look like Tekken 7 or Injustice 2 but it is still good. What I do love about the visuals though is how smooth the moves translated from sprites to this. I was amazed when doing the same moves across 98UM,2002UM, and XIV and they look very well in 3D.I can't review the online part due to my internet connection not really the best. I leave that to other more competitive people to do.All in all this game is a must-buy for fighting game enthusiast. You get a good solid package and a great entry in to the series. Hopefully if this succeeds we will be seeing XIII UM or more cool SNK fighters (we desperately need a new Garou, Last Blade, or something like the good old battle Coliseum!)"

,Recommended,571260,33501586,Posted: 13 July,all,MentalAsPants,"I had a massive text block describing my history with fighting games from before even Street Fighter 1 and how only the true fighting game fans stayed around for the drought of 99-2007 (which The King of Fighters series stayed true, releasing games that whole time).  But decided to say, fighting games, have never been about graphics, its has always been about the soul, technicality, depth and fun.Firstly if you know you fighting games, then you'll know Garou: Mark of the Wolves battle designer, Yasuyuki Oda.  He is the Director os KOF XIV.Garou: Mark of the Wolves is arguably the best fighting game of all time (Yes, even compared to SF3:TS).The King of Fighters roster is incredible and KOF XIV is one of the best rocking 50 (unique) characters old and new (with 4 legendary extra characters in the DLC), you won't find ONLY Charge characters or Shotos, etc.  You'll find a fireball character that has charge moves, command grabs and 2 ""supers"" with two levels of power and a final third CLIMAX super, making up 5 total (Options).  You have many different jumps, from hops to long leaps, meaning you can start with normal jumps but end up being able to plan moves with a tiny little overheap hop.  There's no catchup gimmick and there's no learning other characters special life or abilities above their movelist.  It really is everything a 2.5D game could have to let you feel in control of your fighter.Before my final words, The King of Fighters XIV has;- Arcade Mode (with ending)- Auto combo system for newbies, that allows casual fighting game fans a great stepping stone to true combos- Team specific endings (pick the people from a team and get a canon ending), over 50!- Online Training mode (train with your friends/enemies/teachers)- Online Ranked / UnRanked modes (with great netcode)- Basic Systems Training mode (Character neutral)- Mission Mode for Character Trials (Combo examples)- Survival Mode- Time Attack Mode- Unlockable gallery (Pictures, movies etc)- Great PC Port with minimal requirements (Which is updated all the time).NOTE: Please take the Negative reviews with a grain of salt as the game is updated all the time and as PC gamers we realiseyou need a certain level of hardware for modern games. (Sorry it probably won't work on a business Dell from 2008, but it will work on a minimal gaming rig from 2012).I'll leave you with this, take a chance on The King of Fighters XIV!  It has over 26 years of history, characters and story development. (The King of Fighters Universe, includes but not limited to Psycho Soldier games, Athena Games, Ikari Warriors, Fatal Fury/Garou Series, Art of Fighting Series, Metal Slug Series, and the list goes on).  All mixed in a pot with superior & more varied characters than any of fighting game out there.Come visit Southtown, if you give it a chance, it might just change your view of Fighting games!And as the Lone Hungry Wolf himself, Terry Bogard would say;""Get Ready!  A Storm is coming!""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZAupwRyuow"

This game does not cease to provide players fast-paced, execution-heavy gameplay, and with the tweaked system drawing familiarities from 2K2UM and XIII (such as MAX Mode and CLIMAX DMs), this game proves to be more friendly for newcomers to the series and less arcane for veteran KOFers. The game is also a lot more balanced compared to its predecessor, along with a larger roster of 54, allowing for more creativity and variety on a player's part.Pros:+ Fast-paced gameplay that rewards high-execution mastery+ Large, balanced roster+ Team Battles, 3v3, and 1v1 are all available+ Solid netcode and input reading+ More beginner friendly than XIII with auto-combos and removal of Drive Cancel+ Not just an SF clone+ Gallery and DLC artwork are actuallyreallynice without just being a 'fanservice corner' (I look at you, BB)Cons:- Absolutely poor visuals all across the board (and yes, this game was rushed in development due to some large changes occurring with the company itself, but don't let this discourage you unless you have legitimate reason; I myself say that the XIII 2D visuals were beautiful compared to this)- Quite pricy to most, especially with all the other games on the market- So-so story (the stories in the KOF series have really never been that 'great', per se)- Primarily built for people who are already fans of the series (so not as newcomer-friendly as, let's say, GG, but still more so than XIII)- ...that's actually it.Overall a solid 9/10, there have been some reporrted issues and bugs so far so there is no rush to by this game unless you are just a fan of the KOF series, play competitively/are a pro, or any other reasonable motive to do so. But do I recommend it still? Yes, it is a good, solid fighting game that should not be neglected just because of GGXrdR2, or Tekken 7, or I2, or anything else in the future (I'm looking at you, MVCI).If you need any help or have questions, just leave a comment, PM me, or check the forums to see if someone else had a similar question (you probably want to do this first).*EDIT* (16 June 2017, 14:44) - A patch was announced earlier today that addresses the reported issues and bugs of which I spoke.

Release the jump fast to long short hop; do it without the down press to hop shorter or jump shorter. Hold X/B  and press the dpad in the direction of your opponents when close to opponent to throw and if being thrown press the heavy punch or kick button of the throw quick enough and you can escape it. Press Y/B to do a power (knockback) attack and it even works while airborne.  To block press away from your opponent and to block low press away and down at the same time (diagonal).  For max mode press all four buttons at the same time (A,B,Y,X) and you can rush attack (usually hit X four times but not too quickly for all characters). Oh and A is light kick, B is heavy kick, X is light punch and Y is heavy punch. Now go and rip it up!"

The combos have been made easier if you connect at the right timing which wasn't easier if you were a newbie in KOF XIII but if you are a newbie in KOF XIV then just keep pressing LP repeatedly and it will auto combo for you. This does not mean that you will master it immediately. There are 50+ players to choose from and you have to win tactically, not just mash buttons.There are no problems playing online but if someone is far away then it will lag and if it lags too much then there is a possibility that the game gets frozen and you just have to close the game which is a shame because I found the same problem in KOF XIII and it hasn't been fixed yet.

,Recommended,571260,32470922,Posted: 16 June,all,RageZhar98,"The King Of Fighters XIV is the newest installmet of the KOF franchise of fighting games, which I am a avid fan of. I've played all the KOF games growing up and XIV has honestly surppased my expectations. Seeing the trailers when it was announced for the PS4 almost made my buy the system just for this game. When hearing the PC port announcement, I was so excited and pre-ordered it straight away. This was definetly worth it as KOF XIV has definelty lived up to it's expectations in my opinion compared to other KOF titlesThe gameplay of KOF XIV is where it shines the brightest; it's smooth, consistent and solid making it both welcoming to newcomers (with the Rush system) as well as catering for the hardcore fans like myself. The mechanics are also a new welcoming change, with the return of the MAX mode and the cancelling into Climax moves which opens opportunities to land some real damage. The moves of most of the characters have translated very well from the previous titles as well as throwing in some new ones. Apart from some balance issues here and there, the charcaters play really well and complement the gameplayPerformace-wise, KOF XIV is a worthy port with the game mostly running a smooth 60 FPS, save for the 30 FPS drops here and there and the special character interaction sequences in-match. Other than that. it runs beautifully and there are plently of graphics options to tweak to your preference.In terms of graphics, KOF XIV has taken a drastically different art-style with 3D models as opposed to the majority of previous titles being 2D pixellated sprites as well as the hand-drawn visuals seen in XII and XIII. Personally, I liked the new 3D models despite them looking a bit out-dated as many people have voiced concerns about. I can understand SNK's reasoning behind the graphics because they wanted performance to be smooth, but at the same time they could be a touch better. That being said, it was very good of SNK to release the patch on the PS4 which improved the visuals and shading quite a bit. Compared to the previous graphics, they are much improved and better looking than before. The backgrounds are also amazing to fight on, with a wide range of beautiful landscapes as well as reimagined versions of old favorites (such as the Transcontinental Railroad from Fatal Fury 2/Special) being added via free updates.The character roster in KOF XIV is outstanding, offering a total of 50 chartacters consisting of the original cast (Kyo Kusanagi, Terry Bogard, Ryo Sakazaki, Mai Shiranui etc.) and newcomers alike (Shun'ei, Sylvia, Meitekun, Xanadu, Mian etc.) which all play very nicely and all give a unique way to play the game. The 4 DLC characters are also a nice addition with the likes of Rock Howard, Yamazaki, Whip and Vannessa being very fun characters to play as and I do hope SNK continue to support the game like so with faces new and old being added to the roster and at a reasonable price compared to other fighters on the market.The music, like in all KOF titles, is amazing and an absolute treat to listen to. SNK's talented composers have once again outdid themselves with the soundtrack of this game and are continuly adding more wonderful tunes via free updatesAll in all, KOF XIV is an amazing installment to the franchise which stacks up very well against previous KOF titles. Although it doesn't stand out to some, it's a very solid fighter with amazing gameplay and definetly worth your time for newcomers and veterans alike"

People can complain all they want about the graphics, but what matters most is the gameplay, which SNK has done a very solid job with this game.  This game is worth every penny.  With a roster of 50 or so characters, this game feels way more complete than other popular fighting games.   The game runs flawlessly on my laptop.  I did play one online match.  Unfortunately, there are no players close to me, so I have to set the distance to worldwide in order to get a match and the match only had a 1 bar connection.  It was a very smooth experience till the 3rd round.  It had some hiccups, but nothing game breaking like SFV is.  Imo, the netcode seems better than most other fighting games. I feel way happier with this purchase than SFV.  The 18 brand new characters feel really unique and are incredibly fun to play with.  I especially love Mian and Xanadu.

The normal windowed mode seems to function just like borderless windowed mode should for me, though. I also had to download the GamePad tool they mention on the forums to configure my stick properly.

The combos are significantly simpler than previous ones, meaning if you just start from 14 you can play as well as old players with some practice. The input optimization for keyboard is also very good. The 3D character models are certainly not great(compared to Tekken 7 or SF 5) but everyone except Kyo looks OK to me.Honestly SNK does everything right except the graphics in this game. So overall I would recommend it. If they can make Kyo a little more ""badass"" look rather than ""innocent teenager"" look it would be great.The current best KoF available on Steam is KoF 13, the 2002UM is pretty good as well. For KoF fans, give it a try. For everyone else, it's a fun fighting game if you don't mind the awkward graphics."

Tl;Dr: The game port is good and it is a quality fighting game.KOF XIV breaks tradition in a lot of ways. Tons of new characters, as in fresh characters to the SNK universe as well as some older SNK faces unexpected in KOF, a very home focus on marketing the game and a new 3D animation style that is pretty in some places and rubbish in others. I am a massive weeb so I prefer 2D animated fighters. I can appreciate a good looking 3D art style like Guilty Gear Xrd. KOF XIV does not look anywhere as awful as it did in it's debut trailer and certainly does what it is trying to do at least. It just visually very shiny but a bit bland and while some characters like Yamazaki show so much energy and prove SNK was trying hard to make the best of their 3D it still comes off as bland looking.Gameplay wise obviously it is good. SNK have dumbed down the game a bit but have not sunk as low as some developers go and that is nice. Years and playing and I still have a tough time really getting down the more advanced stuff of KOF even in this easier game but that is entirely my fault. The game remains very fun and shows that some games can go on for fourteen damn games and still be good. The auto-combo system is stupid. A stupid choice made for stupid people. Not that I mind folk enjoy fighting games on a casual level, fighting games can be fun for all, but I dislike auto-combos as a concept and this game does nothing to change that.The King Of Fighters XIV Steam Edition is a good fighting game worth your time. If you want to get into the KOF series I would recommend this or '98 the most at this time."

My specs are above the minimum, yet the game runs at about 30fps when on 1280x720. FMV cutscenes skip and lag a lot. Whenever Vanessa is played, the game suddenly drops from 60fps to 40fps, even on super low res. I'm not the only one who has complained about these issues, some with above the recommended specs had these issues too.The game itself is basically like other KOFs. Simpler than most of the other KOFs, but still more complex than some other fighters right now. Linking from max mode activation cancel is easier than in KOFXIII. I love many of new characters, and many of the choices for returning cast. Lots of game modes, extra content, and the roster is diverse enough to see a LOT of different play, making it very replayable, just as with most fighters.I am sad to be getting a refund on this game because I seem to be one of the unlucky ones when it comes to running it. Some people have it just fine, some even with high specs don't however. I would recommend this game to anyone into traditional 2D fighters, but I give this game a Not Recommended because of compatiblity issues. I would recommend you buy this with caution.

Creative and imaginative supers.3)Great sound effects and voice acting, screams and shouts is energizing.4)Addictive Music5) Challanging boss fight, not cheap invincibility armor bullcrap like Tekken 76)Great Tutorial training mode7)Combos are satisfying to pull off, can be done many ways8)Gameplay encourage risk taking, not a camping turtle korean back parrying nonsense like Tekken 7.Things are difficult to rate at the moment1)Multiplayer, but still able to invite friends, create rooms and play.2)Rank not really working at the momentI bought this for 1/3 of the price of Tekken 7 Deluxe edition. I think its worth it right now when there is a discount, buy it."

76561198006653128,Recommended,571260,32456139,Posted: 15 June,all,ssfsx17,"GameplayDespite being 3-D, it plays like a true KOF game, as opposed to Maximum Impact. The speed of every move feels just right for KOF veterans. It uses the classic Advanced groove, with 3-on-3 fights.StoryEvery single special introduction is now a mini-cutscene. If you loved keeping track of all the special relationships that existed between KOF characters, this game takes it to the next level. It's like SvC's battle intros, except voiced, and without the horrendous flatness of SvC. There are a few unfortunate ones missing, due to the fact that they never brought back voice actors to help with DLC character intros (e.g. no special Vanessa versus Ramon intro).The main story itself is not much, but it still makes more sense than the entire Ash Crimson saga, and it promises a lot more in the future. It does not rely on yet another evil person running the KOF tournament but secretly trying to take over the world, which is a welcome change from past KOF story formulas.Character ListNot as good as KOF 1998, 2002, or XI, but the most iconic hero teams have all returned. There are also lots of new characters who are far better than Ash Crimson, and many of them could easily become iconic in their own right. Unlike a certain other fighting game, it never feels like some character is just the evil version of another one. Hopefully, more fan favorites will get added in later seasons of DLC.MultiplayerHaven't tested - but local multiplayer obviously works well enough for tournaments."

The lag is simply astonishing.I REEEAAAALLLLy wanted to love this game, I have been waiting for a solid ""2D"" fighter since SFV sucked♥♥♥♥♥ and I am not really a fan of Tekken's 3D sidestepping nonsense. I pre-ordered got the deluxe version even and then spent the first 30-40 minutes of my game time trying to get my fightstick working right, after that I spent about 30-45 minutes doing Trials to learn some basic combos and the flow of the game. I then hopped online, played about 6 matches and refunded it.Maybe one day when they fix everything wrong with it since beta I will come back, but until then if you plan on playing online I warn you to be very very disappointed.EDIT: People saying I am the only one experiencing issues online, lol.People saying refunds are a bad thing, lol.People thinking I only ever played this on PC and know nothing about it after ""2.5"" hours, lol.I formed this review based on the product I was given. It is MY OPINION, my outlook on the game overall. If you don't like my opinion, or you already OWN the game and feel otherwise. go write your own damn review and stop plaguing mine with ""you're wrong, blah blah blah."" Since I will just delete your comments as there is no reason for them to exist."

,Not Recommended,571260,32464875,Posted: 15 June,all,≋R≋i≋z≋i≋n≋g≋,Played about one match and already want to go back to KoF 13. The game feels worse then many other similar 3D fighting games.The transition to 3D seems to kill an aspect of the traditional 2D route that I now prefer. It's slower and pacing is reduced as a result.Tekken 7 had similar issues. Past games that I played on other platforms felt much faster.It's a shame because I was looking forward to this so much.
