,Recommended,571310,35222086,Posted: 26 September,all,Dark Bison,"SteamWorld Dig 2 is everything that I wanted from the first game and more, from the story, music, atmosphere, gameplay and level design all comes together to make a very fun and addicting experience. In the game you play as Dot, a robot who’s goal is to find her friend Rusty and to discover what is causing many dangerous earthquakes in the valley. Along the way you will meet fellow bots to help guide you on your adventure.Image & Form really stepped their game up with this one, they’ve listened to the complaints with the first game and made sure not to make similar mistakes, for that I applaud them. All the hard work created a beautiful and mechanically satisfying masterpiece. SteamWorld Dig 2 plays a lot like a Metroid style of gameplay except with ya know digging, you can explore and make bank or stick to the main story at hand, it is up to you and your playstyle.Oh boy the music in this game, let me tell ya, it’s real nice. Walking into the hubworld for the first time made my ears dab with elation. A lot of tracks in the game fit the locations and atmosphere perfectly, at least it gives you an incentive to keep your lamp aflame when digging, if ya don’t then things can get a bit spooky, real quick. The visuals they’re great, just look at the trailer and see for yourself, they’re freaking gorgeous. There are some sections in the game that made me stop and go “whoa that looks insane” and I’m sure others would agree when seeing it for the first time.Difficulty isn’t too high, however, it is much higher than the previous game forsure. Enemies in this game actually have attacks and can feel threatening when encountering them for the first time which is pretty awesome. There is a place from the previous game that has been completely reimagined for SWD2 and holy cow the enemies in that level scared the bolts out of me, I had no idea I was stepping into Resident Evil: Robot Edition. Was a really terrifying and badass experience, had me on edge the entire time.Pros:-Graphics are really really nice-Music is down right awesome-Much longer than the first game if you 100% everything-Upgrades, lots and lots of upgrades-Did I mention Graphics? Cause those are pretty darn good-Collectables with hilarious descriptions to find-Actual storyCons:-Some platform sections can be a bit confusing on where to go-Still wish it was tad more difficult but that’s just me-Should be a stat screen after beating the game to help speedrunners-Fen ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Conclusion:Do I recommend this game? Absolutely, this one is far more superior than it’s predecessor in every way shape and form. Image & Form said “YOLO” and put all the effort into this game. These guys really knocked it out of the park and I hope their future projects are as fun as this one.If you loved the first game then you're in for a treat."

If you're familiar with this genre you know exactly what to expect.Personally I have tried many metroidvania games and I don't really like them. They're neat and kind of clever but not really that much fun to play. The only metroid games that I do like are the original ones.Steamworld dig 2 is a game that I do like. Not because I'm a metroidvania fan or I like the steam world games per se. I like Steamworld dig 2 because it's so well made. It's made by people who loved it. It's a child that grew up in a happy family.Exploring is fun. Upgrades feel meaningful and let me explore new places and reach spots I couldn't before. There is some sense of excitement when I get a new toy. For me this is the meat with metroidvanias. Exploring and feeling good about upgrades.The game is fairly easy, at start at least, but it's challenging enough that I can't just play without thinking. Which is a very good thing. But it's easy enough that I don't have to restart from the starting area every 5 minutes because I died.I would warmly recommend this game to people who enjoy metroidvanias and like the steam world game series.*disclaimer* metroidvania is a game where you explore a non-random world (often in 2D) and gradually upgrade your character's abilities and gain access to new areas and secrets *disclaimer*"
,Recommended,571310,35168966,Posted: 23 September,all,Ronnie Filyaw,"Steamworld Dig 2 is all about progression. You start the game with a pickaxe and walljumps but by the end you have a jetpack, triple grenade launcher, flaming pickaxe, and all manner of life preserving upgrades.Movement feels good after you get a few upgrades, there are a few quirks to mining that may tick people off (you can't hit blocks while you are jumping) but taking some time to learn the game if you weren't already a fan of Steamworld Dig 1 will help. Tip: Stand on the edge of a block to hit a block that is one further away than where you can normally hit.Backtracking to complete earlier caves isn't a pain thanks to the transit system or the constant need for more money to spend on upgrades.You are heavily rewarded for being on the lookout for hidden passages and secrets. There are caves (puzzle rooms) towards the end of the game which will test your agility, timing, and sometimes patience, yet you always complete one feeling just a little proud.The visual style is charming and the music is adequate. There is a large variety in visual design for the places you explore, to name a few: nuclear-irradiated underground forest, apocalypse god worshipping temple, and a very cyberpunk-inspired robot graveyard.I highly recommend Steamworld Dig 2 and also 1 if you haven't already played it, it's considerably shorter than 2."
,Recommended,571310,35163274,Posted: 23 September,all,ITS PICKLE RICK!,"Completed the game in about 8 hours. A little slow at first, however not enough for me to put it down. As I get older it's harder and harder to get into single player games but this one was pretty fun.I regret not having played the first one now, but if you're questioning whether you have to - to play #2, don't worry about it. Didn't bother me."
,Recommended,571310,35205020,Posted: 25 September,all,DaBacchus,"This is a review from a player that never played the previous SWD.I beat the game with 83% on first play through which took me 12 hours. I then went back and got the rest with another 4 hours of play.Graphics - (6/10) Nothing special here. I like the art style but there are very few different tiles which I expected a lot more for this kind of game.Gameplay - (9/10) This is the ONLY reason this game is positive for me. The gameplay is great and a lot of fun. it gets repetitive but that's the level design fault.Controls - (8/10) The controls are very responsive and easy to pick up. The one thing that I don't like here is the wall jumping which can be very annoying at times.Level Design - (6/10) Some puzzles are good and there are neat hiding places but overall the level design is just mediocre. There are very few gimmicks which are not used to their fullest potential. The levels also don't use the players tool to their full potential.Enemies - (3/10) Very simple and boring AI. Not that many variety, not that many bosses. Everything kind of works the same. So many enemy types missing that would complement the block type gameplay.Story - (5/10) Predictable all the way. I kind of don't want to give this a score because I don't play these games for the story but if you're looking for a more engaging story like in Hollow Knight, this is not it. It does have some good humor in it though and tons of references.Replayability - None."

It takes everything I loved of the first game and added even more awesome stuff.- There is much more to explore and the areas are way more diverse. There are so many more hidden areas that end up being very interesting.- New tools that will help you in the mines that can be upgraded extensively.- A lot of background story is provided through hints in the environment but also through plenty of interesting NPCs- The soundtrack is fantastic.Get this.

Graphically smoother and prettier, new interesting mechanics and upgrades etc, along with the old  favs, wonderful music and sound design. I do not see any steps backwards , every element of the game feels improved to me.I am not typically a casual gamer,and usually focus hard on competitive FPS games , but I do play some single player stuff to relax. It is not unusual for me to uninstall a casual game within minutes if I can just tell I wont spend time on it, so when I do install a casual game and end up spending time on it, it feels worthy of reccomending....so here goes."

SteamWorld Dig 2 is a super fun metroid-style platform rpg, where you can gather materials, upgrade your abilities, discover secrets, and traverse an interesting world. If you liked the first, you'll love this. Some of the challenges have definitely been ratcheted up, and I had some near rage-quit moments. Even after beating it, though, I was compelled to continue playing immediately to uncover more of the secrets and go further with my own upgrades. The Steamworld games are getting better and better with every incarnation, and I cannot to see what comes next."

When they were planning and making this game, I image this is how they planned the game:Monday 9:00am - Figure out the story for the new gameTuesday 8:00am - Hey, ask the fans what cool stuff they wish they had in Steamworld Dig 1Wednesday 8:30am - Hey, would do you think we could surprise the fans with?Thursday 9:15 am - Hey, ask the fans what they like in a new game and ask them to name a character while you are at itFriday 7:30am (Breakfast meeting) okay, we got the story, we know what the fans wish they had, we know what we want to surprise them with and we got a wish list from them... now let's make the game!!!I image this is true because the Steamworld Dig 2 speaks to all of this.All good sequels have these traits in common:- Builds on the strengths of the version prior- Addresses the weaknesses / shortcomings with code fixes and/or improved game mechanics- Enhance or add new game elements based on customer feedback that do improve the overall experience- Ignore trolls that don't understand the genre and innovateSteamworld Dig 2 accomplishes all these things and more.  There so many good things about SWD2, but here are the highlights:-	Great story with surprises-	Tight gameplay-	Meaningful, new game mechanics-	New Cog system that allows for unique and varied gameplay based on personal preference and desired challenge level-	New mechanics provide the right amount assistance to aid in finding secrets which is unique / rare in this genre-	Has the right level of difficulty for achievements with ones that speak to players of all skill levels Causal / Regular / Hard-CoreClocks in around 15-20 hrs finding all the secretsOnly one con, I really wanted more to play.  The pace of the game and length is right through.

All of the care, attention to detail, and creativity that was displayed in the first game has been turned up to 11 here. The lightning is gorgeous, the new bots that populate the town are more fleshed out, the new town itself is so much more lively. I love the little touches that really enrich the environment. The first boss fight is both funny and enjoyable. I like the new blueprint system too. This game has more of a story than the first game too (although this is the weakest link in mho) Beware! traps are now much more prevalent.

,Recommended,571310,35341884,Posted: 30 September,all,Keyrock,"The tl;dr version: In a word, phenomenal.SteamWorld Dig 2 takes the enjoyable formula established in the first game, refines and polishes it to a shining diamond, and adds a lot more to it.  This game is bigger and better than its predecessor and one of the best metroidvania style games in recent memory.At its core, SteamWorld Dig 2, like its predecessor, plays as a cycle of dig deeper, return to the hub, sell your ore to buy upgrades.  Once you have amassed a good bit of ore to sell you have a choice to make: Do you play it safe and go back to town, or do you push on and risk dying and losing some of your haul as your light dwindles in hopes of getting more ore and discovering a shortcut back to town deeper in the mine?  Along the way you encounter entrances into short, self-contained puzzle challenge rooms.  These rooms tend to revolve around a central mechanic and test the player's wit and skill.  There is quite a bit of variety to them and while they start out quite easy, they get fiendishly difficult later on.  These rooms often have secret objectives beyond the main objective too and these secret objectives can be especially tricky to obtain.  One such room presented me with a difficult decision at the end.  Once I figured out the mechanic to get through the puzzles it was down to my dexterity with the controller, something that has diminished as I've gotten older.  After several tries, I had reached the end of the puzzle, yet there it was, the optional objective, tantalizingly close, yet I was at near critical health and while the climb to get to the optional objective was short, it was definitely dangerous with a definite potential for me to take damage.  Do I leave the room, go back to town to heal, and come back for the optional objective?  If I do, then I have to go through the whole puzzle again, including a climb that requires a good bit of dexterity and split second climbing.  Or do I go for the optional objective since I'm already right there?  If I die then, while I don't lose anything I got outside this room, I will lose what I got inside it, including another optional objective I had gotten that was out of the way.  I would have to go out of my way to get it again, should I fall.  In the end, I decided to man up and go for it, and I succeeded, then limped back to town on a sliver of health after glorious victory.  The game throws such nice moments of tension at you from time to time.There are also some pretty cool boss fights, as there were in the first game.  I won't spoil anything, but I think the boss fights are even better in this game.  They are quite imaginative and really fun.The controls are tight and responsive.  There are a variety of mechanics. both from your own abilities and the level design, which is quite excellent.  There are quite a few available upgrades that you can tailor your character to your play style.  While you will eventually be able to afford to max out almost everything, through the early and mid game you need to decide what's more important to you, carrying capacity, light source, health, or some of the various digging implements and tools you have.Visually the game looks great.  Image & Form have established a really nice aesthetic for their SteamWorld games and this may be the best example yet.  While the art style is very different, SteamWorld Dig 2 reminds me a bit of Trine in how colorful and vibrant the world looks.  It's very pleasing to the eyes.The musical score is solid, as are ambient sounds and sound effects.While replayability is a bit questionable, the amount of content offered here is quite generous for the price asked.  It's definitely a good value.Overall, SteamWorld Dig 2 is a really excellent game.  It looks great, it plays great, and it's constantly very enjoyable."

Being only an hour into the game, it is a hard to tell anything about it but still, here's some interesting game mechanics and impressions.Upgrade/Cogs mechanic : I love the fact that once you collect cogs, you can use them on specific upgrades without worrying too much about it since you can remove a cog from an upgrade amd use it on something else. This back and forth mechanic makes it easier to play around the different options.The game is just as smooth as the original and I can already tell you that there are plenty of secrets to find. ;)If you enjoyed the original SWD, you will definitely love this one."

76561198408140793,Recommended,571310,35247323,Posted: 27 September,all,Midian,"SteamWorld Dig 2,Or SWD2 is a 2D Platformer first and foremost with light action, RPG, Puzzle and crafting elements.You play as a Robot named Dorothysearching for her friend Rusty, the protagonist from the first game. After a short tutorial dungeon, (to which you can return and loot once you get better gear, love it) Dorothy finds herself in a quaint mining town, tasked with discovering the source of their mysterious earthquakes.From here the player is almost free to explore a vast, 2-D open world. At its core, the gameplay is""press a key to swing your axe.""Futhermore you can jump, dig around, collect and sell resources, gain Experience and levels, fight a few enemies, maybe bosses. You can jump back up walls, but you are fairly limited by the pickaxe's inability to cut diagonally or great distances, and the amount of light your lantern has left. Plan out a route in order to make the most out of every trip to the mines. Every time you die, you lose most of the resources you've collected.This is not really a rogue-like.Upon re-entering mines or dungeons, the enemies and some unique rocks respawn. Everything else like the paths you dug, remain the same.It's a bit of a grind:dig around, collect gems or upgrade Gears, return to surface to sell for Cash, repeat.This is where SWD1 got repetitive in my opinion, and if it wasn't for the crisp controls and exploration, I would have stopped playing.SWD2 has plenty of unlockable gear and upgrades as you progress. You start with the plain axe which can be upgraded to cut stronger blocks, mine more efficiently, deal more damage to enemies etc. After the axe, you may unlock a water bomb (which can later be upgraded to a grenade launcher,) a jackhammer, hook shot, and more. Most of the equipment has several base upgrades for cash, (which is really how you progress the story and unlock new areas), then 5+ specific upgrades for Gears. After the first town, I exploreda lotof optional dungeons and corners of the map before really progressing the story.I find upgrades stream in at a fair rate, and even if you don't want to explore everything or grind much, you will make a good pace.There are some upgrades early on to accelerate your mining, like a larger backpack, or 2 gems per slot.Navigating the mines is the main reason I bought the game.Controls are crisp and responsive. Jumping (you can wall-jump too,) running, mining, combat are executed well. The game supports controllers of course, or you fully map movement and equipment to the mouse or keyboard. You can even use your mouse's side buttons, fairly uncommon for platformers. PersonallyI use WASD for movement, space for jump, and everything else on the Numpad. One thing that bothers me is the glide when you turn in midair.If you find yourself lost, blocked in, or out of lantern fuel, and you can't climb back to town, there are a number of ways to get out of a jam such as fast travel tubes scattered aboutat a fair distance.These will warp you to and from town. There is an upgrade that allows a one-way trip back to town if you are on flat ground and away from danger. You can always suicide, losing some resources of course.I've seen several different environments so far. Besides the tutorial dungeon, west desert and town, there is a windy eastern desert, regular mines, glowing mines,different temples,water, temples, and lava. There's even aHalloween-looking areafor you holiday nuts out there.Not going into detail about the story because A.) I'm not finished the game and B.)That's not why I play platformers.There are some references to other games in the series, but the game stands well on its own.Graphics, art style and color palette are perfect for the theme IMO.Game looks good at 1080p with no glitches so far.Graphics options 1And 2Pros:Large open worldGood pacing on normal modeMostly crisp, responsive controlsTons of unlockable equipment & different upgrades to suit your styleLots of secret areas, optional dungeons and Treasures, which can be traded for unique upgrades.Some quirky humorThe hook shotSome interesting puzzles IMO, like the mine carts and the one where you lure enemies onto pressure plates.The soundtrack is good, though short.Cons:Most puzzles are not revolutionary or particularly difficult.I was hoping different resources could be crafted into different things this time. Instead, you basically sell everything for different amounts of cash.It can be a grind if you don't enjoy the gameplay or exploringNot many different enemies (better than SWD1 though)Turning in mid-air and swimming controls feel strange. Trying to monkey-bar your way across the ceiling with the hookshot is a chore.Kind of annoying to navigate the fast travel map.TL;DRGreat game in its own right, also great sequel, one that returning fans and newcomers alike can enjoy. I rate it aGreat 8/10with 0 being raw sewage, 5 average, and 10 being the greatest 2D platformer of all time, Warioland 3. I would have rated SWD1 a Very Good 7/10.If you are a fan of the SteamWorld series, platformers, mining and/or 2D exploration this is almost a must-have. In terms of pricing thus far19.99 USD is steep for a 2D platformer. I think a $12 sale would be a perfect value. Anything less is a steal. Definitely one of my top 10 games from 2017. Everybody does a space sequel, but this game really sets up a good one."
,Recommended,571310,35146071,Posted: 23 September,all,Majin Boo,"3 hours in so far and loving every minute of it.  Wouldn't mind it being a little more difficult; there were some nice platforming puzzles where timing was key and provided a decent challenge though.  Hopefully it comtinues to ramp up a bit more... Devs nailed the theme once again! I enjoyed the music enough that I didn't mind it looping.  Dialogue sincerly made me laugh at times and I am actually interested in learning more about the world.   Overall it's the quality that I've come to expect from the SteamWorld series (I own steamworld dig and heist) and I wouldn't have it any other way.   So far I'd say it's worth my $20 and if you're a fan of the series it's for sure worth picking this up at full price.Great job guys, hope this game can get some free content updates or dlc in the future because so far I don't see myself wanting to stop playing."

Steady progression of enemies, environments and tools spread throughout the game, so it never feels too grindy. Not too long, which is a bit sad, but at the same time 10 hours of solid gameplay for a single run is fine – you can always try to 100% everything and that will add some hours.As far as comparing to it’s predecessor – I’d say it’s a complete upgrade (not that SWD 1 is a bad game). It feels very similar in theme and gameplay, yet abilities are varied enough so you don’t feel like you are playing completely the same game.Overall quite good game, I enjoyed it despite the fact I’m not a at all a big platformer/Metroid fan. Good theme, solid mechanics, and a ton of pop culture references in artifacts (they make me feel a bit old thb, but alas). Looking forward to the next one from the same developer – they already have 3 games set in the same-ish world, and hey, it’s a nice world."

Beaten Metroid 1, Super Metroid, Fusion, Prime 1-3, Zero Mission, working on AM2R and SR and also beaten Castlevania SotN, CotM, HoD, AoS, DoS, PoR, OoE and other giants in the genre like Ori, Axiom Verge, Guacamelee!, The Shantae Series, Rogue legacy, Teslagrad, Dead Cells, Shadow Complex, etc.SteamWorld Dig 2 is sublime. Easily the best of the non-metroid/castlevania metroidvanias. I am skeptical another game will ever reach SotN/Super Metroid levels of awesomeness, but this game sure as hell comes close. Every area is handcrafted, a lot of thought went into the map. Tons of secrets are everywhere, opportunities for sequence breaking are abundant, the atmosphere (read: art design and music) are top notch, the difficulty curve is just right. I have no real complaints about this game. I'm not done yet but I'm already hooked - this game made me put down Metroid SR. Please make more. One thing I really liked about the first is that is didn't overstay it's welcome - that is, there is no grinding and each moment of playing both steamword dig games feels new, original and not like repetitive/lazy copy pasting - quite a task for a game about continuously digging down to sell gems and repeat. You feel like you're always progressing, always getting new upgrades, always unlocking new areas to explore. And then...the game ends! No wasted time. That was true for the first game anyway, and so far that's been true of this one."

It brings to mind the days of Nintendo cartridges that were bug tested and polished to an infinite degree,  because you can't patch a cartridge once it's out in a customer's hands. These guys deserve a lot of credit for putting out software that is as near perfect as you will find anywhere.The movement, sounds, animation, and music all work together perfectly, like an orchestra. The world they have built and the characters that inhabit it are very charming,As the game begins you play the part of a mining robot who is looking for their lost friend. You come into a town where you suspect he may have been seen. Things open up from there and you set to exploring. Going deeper into the tunnels, mines, and other locations requires upgrades to your base equipment. By mining resources and trading them in town you can decide which upgrades and perks are most important to you. The designers left this very open and you can tailor the upgrades to your play style. It is a lot of fun to see the results of your hard work when you get to try out a new upgrade.The gameplay is superb. Playing with a keyboard did not feel like a hinderance, but I would imagine this game would be perfection with a controller. The movements of your character felt just right, and the game seemed to have a real atmosphere and weight to it. Things felt natural and the physics were predictable and consistent. That is important in a game with lots of jumping, swinging, flying and floating.There is a large variety of challenges. The mines and tunnels have a number of 'rooms' that are self contained puzzle areas where you can find more treasure and artifacts. Some of these can be very frustrating, but they do end up giving you good training for what is to come further in the game. I was swearing like a sailor and vowing to never buy anything from this developer again, but when I finally managed to get through a puzzle, it was extremely satisfying.This developer also considers the player from every angle. Everything is fast, menus are simple and easily navigated. The intro videos can ALL be skipped by tapping the space bar a few times. It also tells you how long it has been since your last save when you decide to quit. Small but important touches that make for a great playing experience.If I had one complaint about the game, it might be length. It feels like it ends just when you are really getting the hang of it. There is not a 'third act' so to speak. Even though the story is complete, it feels like a chapter could have been inserted in the middle to flesh it out a little more. It is priced appropriately, however, and the time you do spend is action packed and lots of fun. To be honest, there is still more to go back for, as I didn't find all the artifacts, but there is no new areas to explore.I certainly got more than my money's worth. I was just sad to see it end. I can't wait to see more from the SteamWorld!"

You have many game series diverging from what made the first game so good, but this game hits the nail on the head. Retaining most of the art style of the original, it still looks and feels like the first, but with extra replayability in the form of achievements and challenges. So basically, without spoiling it, it's the first game on steroids and a tone of extras."

,Recommended,571310,35493858,Posted: 5 October,all,Oli,"Lovely game but a little too easy if you go for all the upgrades early on.There are parts of the game that give you cogs for hard platforming elements. These are made really simple if you go to them late-game and have things like the jetpack but they can be done much, much earlier. Doing them early allows you to get a load of extra upgrades early on. That makes the whole thing really easy.I didn't die once on the final boss.That all said, itisa lovely game. More of the same as SWD1. But prettier and somehow less grindy. I like it."

The core gameplay mechanics have been improved and it feels more like a platformer. You have more abilities and it is more action-oriented than the first.  There is a broader skill set that you can practice and hone your skills.  They really expanded upon all the fundamentals of the game while keeping some of the core concepts from the first.The RPG elements are better, the story is better, the characters are better, the abilities, game mechanics, size of the maps, and length of the game are all just better.If you found the first game boring, you should definitely give this a try because it might be fun enough for you to enjoy now. For others who enjoyed the first game like myself, you'll most likely love this sequel!  Runs beautifully in Linux and with a gamepad, great couch game, well done devs! <3"
