,Recommended,571350,29539493,Posted: 28 January,all,Kodyd194,"I find DED to be an enjoyable Early Access ""Shoot 'em up"". I like the art style and gameplay, it all seems easy to learn but hard to master. As of now there are multiple patches coming with new content soon. Here is to hoping it doesn't stop there.I realized after posting this review the reason this game reminded me so much of Bloody Walls is because it is from the same Dev. If you liked Bloody Walls I strongly recommend you try this game, or vice versa.http://store.steampowered.com/app/531960/"
,Recommended,571350,29529644,Posted: 27 January,all,DrDoSoLittle,"So yeah. Mixed feelings on this game. The primary combat system consists of pressing m whenever the combat bar is on the green bars. It is kind of like that 1970s Troll gameshow, only in this you are getting shot at and die before you have killed three baddies.The game has balance issues in that the baddies can shoot you when you stand right next to them and you cannot shoot them in return. Your character has no ability to take cover, only move and shoot. The reloading time is not my favorite, it loads like a shotgun (IE one bullet at a time). There is a glitch that if you keep pressing M, you will not die until everyone in front of you is dead.It is free and in Beta, so there is time to fix things, so I am going to recommend the game and review it after they have worked out the kinks."
,Not Recommended,571350,29528255,Posted: 27 January,all,Saltlord For Hire,"Controls like hot garbage, UI is a mess, and there's this slight lag whenever you try to select anything in the menu. Also, the gameplay is nothing to write home about.It was free and Early Access so I can't really be TOO upset, but I would figure you'd at least want your product to be somewhat enjoyable. I'll try it again when there's some actual updates."
,Recommended,571350,29583978,Posted: 30 January,all,Dalibar,"I see a lot of negative reviews saying the game is too hard. Don't expect to go into this game and just mow your way through enemies (like I had first expected). You have to learn how long the enemies take to shoot you with each weapon, dodge out of their kill range, and take aim to get better crits. The game is definitely a challenge, which is what makes it enjoyable.The art style is very nice and fits the game, and the music is fast and energetic. Being in early access, it still has its glitcheslike holding 'M' keeps you from dying until you kill all enemies in range, and if you stand against the wall where enemies spawn, they get stuck on you and you can shoot them without getting hurt. None of these are game breaking and are easily avoidable if you don't purposefully do them.*Fixed*All in all, I would recommend DED for anyone who likes a challenging game with simple controls. The updates look promising, with achievements, bosses, and perks planned. And the developer seems to listen to the community so far, which is a huge plus.Pros:- Nice art- Simple controls- Challenging- FreeeeeeCons:- Not enough locations (they all sort of look the same so far, but I'm sure that will change seeing the screenshots)- Not enough weapons- Controls on the menu can be a bit annoying (hint: press esc after changing volume)"

Really good job guys! I like how its not just a shoot kill game, you have to sort of plan stuff out to kill the enemies. I can't wait for the new updates. 10/10 simple yet fun for short game sittings"

,Not Recommended,571350,29551462,Posted: 28 January,all,supedeglupe,"i personally did not know what to expect but after reading the reviews, I think people have a misconception of the diffference between ""hard video game"" because its hard, and hard because it is bad. The controls are weird for no real reason on keyboard, and the UI even more so pitiful. I was hoping for a little bit more even though its early access and free but I guess not? Hopefully this game will redeem itself later down the line but i am not holding my breath for it"

,Recommended,571350,29688680,Posted: 4 February,all,Hydrus BlaZe,"NOTE: I would highly recommend reading my indepth guide on this game if your confused about something.So after bashing your head against your keyboard out of frustration of not knowing what the perks do, how to dash and what the bars do under the enemies (all features that wernt explained to you) you come to the steam reviews in desperation for help before you uninstal the game. Dont worry, papa Hydrus BlaZe has got you covered. First of all the perks I still havent understood all of them, the first perk gives you another heart the second the skull gives you a heart for every 5 kills (4 with next upgrade and 3 with 3rd upgrade) the bullet gives you more bullets and the dash icon makes your dash recharge faster, speaking of dash, you use the < > keys, not the arrows keys , ♥♥♥♥ knows why you cant change key binds and the bleeding heart increases your crit and with the next lvl increases your damage. And the last perk makes easier crits thats all I know for what the perks are. Your guess is as good as mine as for you wont find that out by playing the game.Now for the random bar at the bottom of the enimies. This is the critical hit bar. Shoot the enimie when it goes over the yellow bar. (BTW the shoot key is M terrible keybind that you cant change and are forced to strain your arm over the period of playing this game.Over the time of playing this game Ive realize %50 of the time is trying to beat the 3rd level %25 is learning wtf the perks do and the other %25 is playing levels over and over and over again. (I manged to bag all the achievements :D) hard core mode being the hardest of course but I spent three hours on the same lvl not realizing there was a perk that made you do more damage lol. Restarted the campain and finished almost flawlessly with the damage buff in about 15 min. So yea... I would reccomend the damage upgrade,Anyways this game has potential, but my stategy to you is to save bullets, use your dash ability that you only learn how to use after a hour of game play to go past enimies to go to one side of the screen the unload on the ""train"" enimies and dash past them and repeat.Not bad indie title and I have high hopes for it and cant wait for the dlc."

,Not Recommended,571350,29688453,Posted: 4 February,all,Eminem,"After playing this game for an hour. I can surely say it is very ♥♥♥♥ing poorly made. My main problem is the ridiculousness of how robotic your strategy has to be. There is no way anyone can play their way, but must instead play like how the cockhead devs wanted it to be. Maybe this game might be better when the game isn't beaten by Bad Rats in gameplay, graphics, and difficulty. R.I.P Gaming 2017... we hardly knew thee."

Great game nonetheless.I would like to know the story behind it all, why would a criminal organization kill a family man and his wife, to then kidnap their daughter?And what with the angel wings?I NEED ANSWERS.Now waiting for a sequel.Grampa took down an entire criminal organization, which means the turf is now open for business.A new gang is in town, they hear of the exploits of a old man who was able to annihilate the previous gang. They see him as a possible threat, so they put a hit on him. Unfortunately, Grampa is killed, and his granddaughter is orphaned. One of Grampa's old war buddies takes her in, and trains her.

,Recommended,571350,29614614,Posted: 31 January,all,Step Vibes,"Damn challenging game this was, though I did enjoy playing it. I went in thinking it was gonna be a story-based game (judging by the trailer), but it turned out to be a simple wave-based game. Although I'd prefer if it did have a small story mode, it was still fun to play. And I know it's still in development, so most likely the dev(s) are gonna add much more to the game, including weapons, enemies types, upgrades, and maybe even a story (who knows). Cool game nonetheless!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrlVIrqez0k"
