My friends and I will switch between the two games depending on which style of gameplay we'd prefer for the evening (or sometimes play both!). GWYF is slightly easier to get into and the controls make the game slightly more reasonably competitive. GWYF also has a more polished feel. Golf It!, on the other hand, is a little more zany (for lack of a better word), and the controls add more pressure to every shot.With the addtion of extra clubs and considering the possibilities available with the level editor and Steam workshop integration, this game has almost infinite replay potential."

,Recommended,571740,34217035,Posted: 13 August,all,Kalli,"Golf It! is not your traditional mini-putt you used to play on various flash games websites. Using the Unity Engine, its a 3D golfing and putt-putt game that ditches the traditional ""Power Meter"" in favor of using the mouse to control the power of the swing. The player brings the mouse back to prepare the swing and the power of the swing is determined by how strong (aka: fast) the player moves the mouse forward.This brings a frustratingly fun aspect to the game that differentiates itself from all the other golf games on the market. Combined with a very diverse map creation kit and multiplayer it makes for great fun with friends.For the low price point of the game, you can get tons of enjoyment playing this thing. While it is in its beta stages as of the time of writing, I expect more polish and to iron out the physics kinks as time goes on.8.5 / 10"

,Recommended,571740,30382527,Posted: 7 March,all,Big Beef Derky,"Number One Complaint I've ReadThe number one complaint I've read about this game is the controls for putting the ball. I went in thinking it would take me a few hours to get the hang of it. It took me about30 secondsto understand how it worked, I cannot understand what the challenge is for some people in figuring it out. You point the ball in whatever direction you want it to go, left click to set it in place, and then the putter appears. You actually use the mouse to swing the club, so you have to move the mouse quick if you want to hit it hard, or slow to just tap the ball.It's the closest thing I've felt to actually playing minigolf, bar none, the best controls for a minigolf game.Rest of ReviewI haven't got a chance to play any multiplayer yet, as I just purchased this a little over an hour ago. I went through the first 18 course hole, Grasslands, and it was fun to play through, even on my own. None of the holes felt poorly designed, or lazy. The physics from hitting the ball never went crazy, every hit went exactly how I expected it to go, depending on how hard I hit the ball. I was not disappointed, in the slightest, with my purchase after completing that course. I look forward to seeing what the other courses look, and play, like. Also, for whatever updates are to bring to this well-crafted early access game. I enjoy Golf with Friends a lot, but this game adds more to the genre, along witha lotmore customization, than GWF probably ever will. I've always wanted to enjoy a map editor with a friend, and this is the only game I've experienced with where that is finally possible. The editor is very complex, and you can get overwhelmed by the options presented to you, but if you're like me and explore/test things out, you'll figure most of it out within half an hour, at most. This editor is lacking in the tutorial department, by a lot, but I figured that will be added on at a later date. I spent around an hour just goofing around and finished designing a single hole, and was so pleased with the outcome. I haven't been this excited for a map editor since the first couple far crys.Final VerdictWith the lack of tutorials, I think that is this game's only downfall, as of right now. I didn't experience any bugs myself, but I didn't play for a long time, and I plan on pouring a lot more hours into this. The graphics were fantastic for a minigolf game, I don't know if it's the best out there, but it's the best I've seen. The soundtrack was soothing, I'm not a stickler for the game's having a poor/awesome soundtrack myself, but for other's sakes, I would say it fits with minigolf very well.I would give 'Golf It!,' in it's current state, a 8/10. After a few updates, and tutorials added for those who are having troubles with the game's controls, it will be even better. I look forward to seeing the progress of this game, and hope you enjoy it as well, should you decide to purchase it."

76561197966522589,Recommended,571740,29988500,Posted: 17 February,all,Teut,"One of the best crazy golf games I've played.Usually I play 'Golf With Your Friends' with a few others. While 'Golf It' is slightly lacking in some of the crazier options of GWYF such as low gravity, big balls or shapes. It makes up for it with better and less bug free gameplay.Input is analogue based, moving the mouse to swing the putter. A far better method than the power-level of GWYF, where it was easy to remember a power-level and angle to get an assured hole in one. There's an option to change the sensivity of the mouse and the putter speed to your taste.The maps are interesting, fun and really good looking usng the Unreal engine to good effect. Hopefully some more graphical effects will be added later to really utilise this engine a bit more.There's a couple of holes that are really hard, particulary on the mine level, trying to get the ball onto moving carts.I'd like to see an option added in the future to decrease the size of the holes. AS it is it's a bit easy once your close to get the ball in. Making the holes optionally smaller would add a little bit more challenge for seasoned players.I tried to have a look at the editor, but I couldn;t find any way to add stuff to the new map I started. A tutorial or link to an instruction manual would be really helpful. The option to allow friends to edit the maps with you is quite original, I'm not sure if that measn you can all edit the map, or just one of you while the rest comment...or critique like the muppets I play with.All in all it is by far one of the best crazy golf games, if not the best. Pricing is spot one."

Both have differences. This game is less buggy and much more fun. There is even an option to download maps from workshop or make your own. How great is that?

It's become the perfect steam off-blower around the office with coworkers in the evenings.Mini-golf game-wise, it's no better or worse than any other, although the miniscule development team of 1 makes it a little rough around the edges sometimes. What makes it so interesting is the simultaneous play of all players in the multiplayer mode I mentioned, so you can be a♥♥♥♥♥♥and race to the hole, blasting others out of your way. That and the fact that all of the 18 holes have to be laid out on one physical course like real mini-golf means you can make all kinds of terrible shots that land in the green of another hole, which is hilarious.It's wanting of a little visual polish, and very much looks like a basic Unreal Engine game, but man it's good fun with friends."

,Recommended,571740,33266294,Posted: 5 July,all,123,"This game, like Golf With Your Friends, will always be something you and your mates can fall back to and count on for carefree, stupid fun (or anger, depending on temper levels).While GWYF will provide you with greater gameplay customization and a simple-to-grasp physics system, Golf It makes up with the ability to play user-submitted maps that anyone can create, which will ultimately add to the game's longevity and your own personal enjoyment as it continues to push through early access. And its physics and putting system, while a little more annoying to deal with at times, creates a bit of a more interesting dynamic when it comes to playing through courses as you can't just replicate power levels and setup consistent, reliable hole in ones, something far more possible in its counterpart.I'll definitely be seeing myself sinking more hours into this than I did Golf With Your Friends (which is by no means ""unfun"" either). If you and your friends are willing to splurge the extra couple $$ and are looking for something that you can kick back and socialize over for consistent fun, I'd look no further!"

It's a simple game, course design in interesting, a little luck is required (like any mini golf games), and even after becoming comfortable with the controls, I've come back to play it over and over. Worth it for the price if you're looking for a golf game with pretty graphics and replayability."
,Recommended,571740,31981300,Posted: 26 May,all,Dumle,Golf it is a pretty fun mini golf game where you can gather a couple of friends and talk nonsense while playing a couple of maps. The big advantage of this game is the level editor and though i haven't myself made more than a couple of holes there are enough map makers for there to be fresh levels when i want to play a bit with my friends. Hopefully this will continue to be the case. Overall the game does what you would expect a mini golf game to do and there is a bunch of map themes and gimmicks which can be used in maps.The game do have some problem and these are more visible in custom made maps. The hit boxes of objects often does not fit their visuals and tiles sometimes does not fit perfectly together which can cause the ball to go in unexpected way. You can of course blame it on the map makers but it is still a problem. Sometimes the physics also seems odd and some levels causes frame rate problems. I have also encountered some problems joining games but it has often been solved by restarting the game. The music can also get a bit repetitive.

I found I had to turn up the putter movement from 5 to 20 because it just took to much eeffort to hit things hard.The one thing I would love seeing is Jumping like GWF, that simple mechanic makes it so much fun to try to cheat the maps. Some small tweak I would say is decrease the ball size and the hole size because that hole is the size of a basket ball net.I would recommend people to get this game if you enjoyed GWF, making your own holes?! sold!"

,Not Recommended,571740,31210368,Posted: 17 April,all,Andem,"I don't really want to give this game a thumbs down, but I can't recommend it when I feel there's another very very similar game that does what this game tries to do, but better. Golf With Your Friends is cheaper, and quite frankly is the superior game when it comes down to it.Normally, I wouldn't mind some flaws, but this game has two major cons that I don't think will be able to be fixed without MASSIVE reworks to the entire game, sadly.First and worst of all, the level design is extremely unforgiving. I don't mind a challenge at all, but this is mini golf. Meant to be a casual game to play with friends. I think maybe in the first level on maybe hole 4 or 5, you'll see the start of an awful trend in these levels.There are MANY many times when you work your way to a hole, usually taking a few strokes to get there, only to find that if you make a mistake on the last stroke, the level will send you back to the very START of the level. It's extremely frustrating, and quite frankly too unforgiving in a game for casual minigolf.Some more signs of unforgiving level design. There are QUITE a few spots where there's just holes in the map for what seem like the sake of frustrating you and your friends. This isn't inherently bad, but it's used MUCH too often in this game I'm afraid.And worse still, there are a couple holes that are quite literally just RNG/memorization. I REALLY do not appreciate that kind of design in just about any game. By RNG, I mean pick a hole to go in, and it shoots you out to your death or back to the start of the level. Now, many minigolf type things do this, but in this game, its either you pick the right one and go to the hole, or you just fall into a pit and lose a stroke or are taken back to the start.I will be fair on that last one, however, that there's not many RNG/memorization holes. Maybe 2-3, but, still, it shows off a lack of understanding to level design.The next major con is the physics. The physics are not terrible by any means, don't get me wrong, but they're just not good enough, I'm afraid. When putting, you're meant to sort of ""flick"" your mouse and how hard you ""flick"" it is how hard you will send the ball. Unfortunately with this style, it is VERY hard to be precise with your power, and with the horrendously unforgiving level design that DEMANDS precision, it makes for an even more frustrating experience.The ball itself also REALLY does not like to stop rolling. This is a big problem as well since most rounds are timed. I actually found myself having to increase the standard time by one minute simply because of these wonky physics. It also makes for a lot more downtime between shots, which isn't fun either I'm afraid.I'll give a brief view on the Pros, though. The graphics are great. It's a nice looking game. The level editor is a super idea. The online is also quite good, however the UI needs work. (Have to start and host a new game every time a map is finished.)My recommendation is just get Golf With Your Friends. It's cheaper, has better physics (slightly!) and has much better and more forgiving level design suited for casual golfing with well--your friends.  The graphics are not as pretty, and the online can be a tad wonky, but I don't find that to be a major downfall personally. There is no level editor in that game, yet sadly, so if a level editor makes or breaks your decision, then I suppose go for Golf It! for now. I assume Golf With Your Friends has plans for a level editor in the future.Sorry for the downer review, it's not a bad game by any means, but simply feels inferior. Maybe the devs will prove me wrong and fix the issues I have with it now, but in its current state, I wouldn't recommend picking up this game."

I get the moving of the mouse mimicing the swinging of the club, but in that case you should add and option to do side to side swings instead of just forward. I feel like I can't control the power pushing forward very well, so my ball always goes flying off or barely moves, it's rare to get in between. If I could do a right to left motion (or left to right for the lefties) I feel like I could control it much better. I also tried to change the settings, both for mouse and putter, but I'm not sure if I should be putting thier speeds up or down. Didn't really feel like it made much of a difference. So for that reason I guess I'd have to say don't recommend.Also if that is an option in game I didn't see it, so in that case you'd need to make your menues more clear I suppose. I would recommend if the controls were easier to grasp."

,Recommended,571740,34840053,Posted: 9 September,all,hydro,"This is a very fun and challenging game that is sort of like a puzzle but I have noticed a few bugs while playing although this is in early access so im not too fussed (read whole review)Some bugs:- The screen when you recieve an item after the game is bugged and sometimes shows twice and I can't click out for like 20 seconds, also I play on 1080x720 windowed and the tint isnt there on the sides.- The lost connection screen has the same problem- The ""you have been kicked"" screen has also the same problem- The ball sometimes changes randomly to different colours- The menu screen when hosting/joining is buggy when someone joins a custom map it freezes for a little.Things I would like to see:- Editor tutorial. I went on the editor to try to mess around and I got stuck quick, I would like to see sort of like a welcome video or a basic tutorial as it doesn't tell you much.- Host Options. When I host a game and I accidentaly miss out in writing something I think ""well sh*t"" because now I have to re-host the game which is a pain; I would like their to be a way to edit the titles and the amount of people allowed in the lobby, just for the sake of time.- Server hosts. This would be a *huge* addition to the game, investing in like 5 servers would help out the game a ton. I'm suggesting they put a COD type menu where after a game you can still stay in the lobby and you can vote for the next map (the maps can be the most rated in workshop) to help with the flow of the menus. Although this is a big ask I would an extra $4-$5 for this and I think others might as well; the server hosts would also help with the connection.Pro's/Con's of the game:Pro's:- Fun and easy controls- Has an in-game editor and workshop- Customization (a little limited)- Ability to play online or single player.- Has an active community- It's more laid back and chillCon's:- The search filter doesn't save so it's a pain to search for games without passwords.- Limited ball customization.- Editor is very hard to use if you are new to map making.- There are barely any servers there so its hard to find people to play with.- Lots of out of bounds glitches.Overall this is a very good game and I have had a very fun time playing it, and would recomend anyone to buy this as long as they are not on a laptop trackpad. If any game developers would like me to go into more details add my steam and I can message you."

,Recommended,571740,33046878,Posted: 30 June,all,OmicroN,Fun mini/putt style golf game specially if you like Golf With Friends.  The thing this game has going for it over GWF is its steam workshop support so there's lots of levels to play on vs the 5 or so GWF comes with.  This game doesn't have as many customization options as GWF does and of course the putting style is different where's GWF uses a meter to determine how hard you it and Golf It uses your mouse to control how far back and how fast you swing which is more technical.I'd say get both games but although this has a lot more course choices to play on me and my friends still play GWF 90% of the time over Golf It for all of its customization like ball sizes and shapes and hitting style.

Golf with Your Friends is a fun and simple game which understands the idea of a casual crazy golf game, Golf It simply does not. It has moments of unique brilliance with cannons and some pretty crazy courses, but the gameplay mechanics just make the game less fun and more of a chore to play.Maybe I'm too used to Golf with Your Friends, but Golf It, when a simple golf game, is at its best, but once it adds numerous gimmicks, it just becomes a complicated mess. Honestly, I hoped for more after reading the reviews but this game is honestly just a lesser version of Golf with Your Friends and after playing each course once, I just wanted to get a refund as soon as possible."

This really makes Golf It a better choice than Golf With Your Friends, both games are very similar in the way they play and work.*******************************************************************************************************Golf It is essentially mini/crazy golf with a bit of ball customisation and a few other rules such as ball jumping, changing club and hitting your opponents ball out of the way or knocking them back down ramps and obstacles to troll them to hell. As a single player game it only has 4 courses and will get boring quite quickly but add a few friends, discord/skype and a custom map and it's great fun and well worth £5. I'm not saying the average player will get hundreds of hours out of it but its defiantly a game to kill the odd half an hour here and there.I think it's a better game than Golf With Your Friends purely because it has Steam Workshop content and you can build and download custom courses. There are currently over 1000 courses on the Workshop made by players.The devs have basically taken all those browser and webpage mini golf games added a few rules and allowed friends to play and troll you by allowing players to take shots at the same time and race to the hole.New players can download my courses from herehttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198130063094/myworkshopfiles/?appid=571740"

They have a wide variety of maps to download (subscribe to) in the workshop and well designed maps that come default with the game, along with scoreboards at the start up menu.

The graphics are very whimsical-esque and range from an underground theme to a winter wonderland theme.  The game is in Early Access but it seems to be an EA game that has a solid standing, unlike other games that have weak releases or are very VERY early Alpha demos.   There is not a whole lot to say about the game, mostly due to its nature so I will list the pros and cons and then have a final note.Pros:Easy to pick up and easy to playDecent graphics that look good enough to enjoy without being hyper realisticInteresting map themesMini golf sandbox (will talk about later on)Steam Workshop capable[[*]Devs have positive attitudeConsCertain levels dont feel balanced but no biggieMinor bugs and glitchesNot much variety or challenge once you beat each courseMusic used for each map theme gets very annoying after the first few times of hearing itFinal thoughts:    I saved this part for the last since this is the biggest and best feature that the game has going for it.  Gold It! has a sandbox mode where you can make your very own golf course.  I only spent a few minutes on it but for those who have always wanted to make their own mini golf course design, this is for you.  You can choose a bunch of assets and visual effects and what not.  There are people who have already made a bunch of maps already, many of which are very enjoyable to play.   When I have time, I plan on trying it out myself, but for now, its a great feature for those with the will to make a course.In short, this game has a fair price and offers a few hours of entertainment, more if you are into creating your own maps.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys some casual mini golfing and for those who enjoy creating maps."

How hard you're going to hit your shot does take a bit to get used to but overall I really like the extra pressure it adds having to be precise with how far you pull back and the tempo at which you push forward with.I enjoy all the base courses except for the one with cannons and teleporters. Personally I don't enjoy the cannon or teleporter mechanics.   The workshop also has a lot of really good courses, so there is a lot of good content here.Cons:Early access means there's still a few bugs in the game.  The only ones I have encountered have not been game breaking though, but I have lost a few strokes from the ball going in the hole and registering as out of bounds on occasion.The UI also needs some work.  Chat can break between shots and holes.  No way to kick an afk player in the middle of the match.Overall: 8.5/10"

If you like playing with a friend or preferably for this game, a small group of friends you're in for a treat.I bought this for myself and 3 friends and holy crap we had a blast. It's early access as of this review and I saw some people having technical issues, but none of us actually ran into any. The only thing was that one of our friends has a rather crappy computer and he would lag in our games. We figured it was his internet connection, but after looking at the forums and finding a post by the developers addressing this, he only had to turn down his graphics and everything was peachy.Turning collision on and playing this with a group of friends is probably one of the best multiplayer experiences I've had in quite a while. We were laughing and shouting so much!As of this review there are 5 18-hole courses with different themes. You've got the default grassy plains, winterlands, mines, graveyard and pirate maps. These are a lot of fun, well thought out and I could actually feel myself wanting to master them when not trying to screw over a friend.Then there are the workshop maps and we've only just gotten started on those. I can image that as this game gains popularity and players there will only be even more awesome courses to play and the potential here is great.Anyway, there's a reason I usually don't write reviews, I just blab out my thoughts as they come, but in any case I just wanted to leave a thumbs-up for this game."

,Recommended,571740,34964113,Posted: 14 September,all,Dippy Eggs,"While San Francisco may be better known for its private clubs such as U.S. Open venue Olympic Club or San Francisco and Lake Merced golf clubs, there are a few public gems in the immediate area and a wealth of daily fee courses in the metropolitan area. Within San Francisco, the famous TPC at Harding Park, where the late Ken Venturi developed his game, is probably the best known. Renovated a few years ago, the course has played host to several high profile events recently, including the President's Cup and the Champions Tour's Schwab Cup. But there are some less expensive options inside the city (although certainly not cheap), such as The Presidio -- a former military course turned public, with terrific views of the Bay – Golden Gate Park and historic Sharp Park, a 1932 Alistair Mackenzie design. But because San Francisco is landlocked and quite congested, the vast majority of great public golf lies in the surrounding areas, from Oakland to the wine country north and south. For example, just across the Golden Gate Bridge, there's Bodega Harbor Golf Club, a Robert Trent Jones Jr. design overlooking the ocean. About 45 minutes down the coast from San Francisco is the 36-hole Ritz-Carlton Half Moon Bay, which rivals Pebble Beach, when it comes to ocean views. Or head toward San Jose to check out the impeccable CordeValle Golf Club, the former home of the PGA Tour'sFrys.comOpen. Of course, if you're in San Francisco, it would be a shame not to carve out a couple of days to head south to the Monterey Peninsula, where you’ll find the famous Pebble Beach Golf Links, Spanish Bay and Spyglass Hill, just to name a few."

We both enjoy playing in the real world but was skeptical about planing on digital media.  Was pleasantly surprised by it. The courses are challenging paring up for a multiplayer match simple and well worth the 20 dollars total we spent for the game for two systems.  Highly recommend this game if you enjoy miniature golf and you can customize your game experience and your balls to different colors.

Yes, it's a bit buggy and a little glitchy here and there but it works amazingly well! The only thing I wish for in that (which it is under development) is that when you duplicate an object, it keeps it's properties instead of resetting to the default (ex. candles, rotators, transformers, etc.).The steam workshop integration allows for hours of amazingly fun gameplay and you should definitely gather a few friends and play a game!

The game is easily in Early Access mode as my friends and I have found many bugs, but we expected that and actually came with some extremely funny moments. I do like the maps already in the game and cant wait for new ones. With the workshop there is an endless amount of courses so it is not as boring as Golf with your Friends. I enjoy this over GWYF for some reasons, but vise versa for GWYF. I would have to say GWYF is my favorite as the controls just seem better, but with the workshop this is a CLOSE second."

So either you play solo (ew what) or you play with your friends.I have a bit of a performance issue, mainly due to the Unreal Engine, but also because my computer sucks.Finally, the pull back and launch mechanism is ingenious, but tedious.

Much more creativity and variety of maps in this game than in golf with your friends, so there are many fun courses to play. Also, you have to judge the power yourself by dragging the mouse, which makes the game enjoyable and challenging. It's much better than the power bar used in golf with your friends, as this makes the game too boring and easy.

You can really create whatever you want and it's quite easy to get the hang of it. Plus you'll never run out of holes as the steam workshop is full of well-built creations from the community.-- Can be laggy and lack optimization overall. There could be more default maps, but they promised to add a few more.A lot of people seem to criticize the aim & shoot system but I think it's just a matter of experience; you get used to it after a few games. To me it's even better than a classic power bar where you just have to click to shoot; here you actually have to move your mouse and imitate a swing movement which is quite fun.I would definitely recommand this game, but only if you play it with friends.

I thought this would be better I can't wait for the update that makes this worth the extra $3 over Golf with Your Friends."

,Not Recommended,571740,32956954,Posted: 28 June,all,WoodyPlaysGames,"This game seems to be a clone of Golf With Your Friends. Unfortunately, it misses the mark for me. The courses (and individual holes) are VERY difficult, and some are near impossible without hitting the ball just perfectly. There are too many trick shots and stunts needed to complete many of the holes in the game. Many of the holes could be more enjoyable if there were more walls to keep the ball from falling off the course. Plus marks for being able to play with friends online or locally, but it's really annoying that you have to create a new lobby after each game and send invites to all of your friends again. As a streamer, it's not good that everyone gets booted and must rejoin the lobby over and over. Overall I like the original designs of these courses, but they are really too difficult to play without wanting to rage quit many of the holes. Take away some obstacles, add more safeguards to keep players from leaving the course, and fix the auto-terminating lobbies and this game could be right there with GWYF. Until these improvements are done, I won't be encouraging my friends to buy it."

You have a developer who is constantly adding new features while squashing bugs in multiple, weekly updates!  Not only that, the dev actually listens to customer feedback, replies to discussions and implements many of the user suggestions in new versions plus he's a genuinely good guy:).  The multiplayer with friends is super solid, haven't had a single connection issue and pace of play is very quick which is a good thing.  With the integrated course designer that allows you to create the course of your dreams (or live cooperative design with friends, unbelievably cool) there should be a huge variety of course freely available to play as the game continues to develop a following.As good as the game is now there are some things that can use more tweaking.  I've recently been playing a round or two on Friday nights with a small group of friends and the most common complaint I hear while on Discord is that at times the golf ball doesn't bounce off walls with enough energy.  Another one is that the ball can take too long to come to a complete stop when on a slight grade.  Fortunately, these are both simple issues that I have no doubt will be addressed.If you've bored to death of the same courses in GWYF and want a mini golf experience that requires a bit more skill you will absolutely love Golf It!"

I'm looking forward for this game getting out of early access.The reason for my downvote however, is because the main thing in this game is flawed: Actually hitting the ball. It is fairly difficult to determine how much force you're actually using when you swing the golf club, thus the results are very irritating as the ball flies over the edge instead of just few meters forward, or doesn't move at all.I hope that the creators will look into alternative options for the club swing, and maybe add them to game.

,Not Recommended,571740,30228788,Posted: 27 February,all,Lettre,"So before you go further with your decision to buy this.  Know this one thing.Most of the holes that are cumulative in each course have unfair gimicks.  Many of the holes either start you at a spot where an intended flow of the course isn't feasible, or the shot count doesn't line up with the actual possible route to the hole.  Currently in the Pirate Course under development, the cannons do not work.  The second time the cannon appears, the cannon doesn't have proper strength or power output making the hole impossible.  This is echoed nearly every subsequent appearance of the cannon.  Some of the obstacles make actually playing the game unfair.  There is a hole where you need to shoot from a cannon through some palm trees.  A later hole has a gosh darm SAIL in the way.  hitting any of the trees is an instant restart.  And the expected stroke for par count is entirely unrealistic.  Hole 18, Grassland, the bar at the top of the slope makes it almost impossible with the putting system to sink the putt.  Hole 18 Winterland, the blocks with the gaps between them mark an incredibly difficult end to a rather easy course.  It can be compared to a level on Super Monkey Ball 1 Master 1.  Most of the platforms are either useless, or a deathtrap.  If you land on any of them safely, you have no choice but to restart.  I honestly think that before this Dev team should consider releasing content,  PLAYTESTING each hole, to answer the question: Is this fair?  If your putting system is going to be as granular as moving your mouse back and forth, where not all mice are created equal, you absolutely NEED to test for fairness for each hole.The only saving grace for this title so far is the Steam Workshop support.The TL;DR really is HESITATE before you buy, it's too late for me to get a steam refund, but it's not too late for you to save money."
