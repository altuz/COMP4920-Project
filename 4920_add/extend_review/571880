You're not going to get much gameplay, but you should know that already.It's sort of a 'choose your own adventure' style book with some twists. If you're fine with multiple playthroughs (the game gives you skip options) then it's definitely worth it. If you're not, then it's not your kind of game, silly."
,Recommended,571880,32055084,Posted: 29 May,all,Jozz,"This game is...interesting! The story is bizarre, the characters are quirky, and the premise of the story and the origin of this dragon society are just plain*zany*. The story's tone frequently crosses the line between serious/somber and lighthearted silliness without care.However, once I got over the shock of how weird the premise is, I found this game to be a lot of fun. This game knows how silly it is, and is filled with jokes and easter eggs that had me chuckling pretty often. The individual characters are for the most part fun, unique, and well-written. Most are likable at some level and have their own demons that give them depth and make them relatable. I think this is where the game is at its strongest, and it makes the game worth it.Being an interactive visual novel, the player is given many choices in the story. There are many endings. Each of the five main characters has a good and bad ending. There is also an additional bad, neutral, and true ending. I would say themajorityof choices impact either your relationship with a character or the main story in a substantial if only minor way. It's nice to see the game reference an action you took far back in the story (or even an earlier playthrough; yes, the game has meta-narrative elements). As the game requires several playthroughs to achieve the true ending, it is fortunate that you can skip any scene. You can also blaze through text you have already read, and the game will stop automatically if the dialog has changed from any prior playthrough. You'll be using this feature a lot if you want all the endings. You can save also save at any point, and the game offers plenty of save slots.Now the mystery elements. Again, if you can suspend your disbelief and get over the bizarre premise (why is an alien ambassador who appeared mysteriously from another time only watched by a single unarmed bodyguard??), there is a fun little mystery to figure out here. Figuring out how to achieve each character's good ending is compelling enough, but the true ending I think is where the game could have done a little better. Instead of playing through the game several times to figure out a specific set of choices that will result in a good ending for everyone, you simply need to achieve each character's good endings in separate playthroughs. From there, the true ending more is more or less automatic. You basically run through the story as you normally might, and most of the bad stuff that can happen pretty much just prevents itself from happening. When you get to the end you are simply given the option at the end to say ""OK I want the true ending now"" (to be fair, there is an explanation for this, albeit an outlandish one). You are then given some additional cutscenes and all is revealed. Because of this, the game is less so about solving a mystery and more so about achievement hunting.Because of how the mystery is solved,I would say this game is a dating sim with mystery elements rather than the other way around.My only other complaint is the disparity in quality/style of art used throughout the game (as mentioned by many other reviews). Most of the backgrounds are professional-grade stills done in an anime style, and there are also some very nice looking stills of the characters that are shown in different scenes as well as the gallery (I really like these) outside of the story. However, the character art for the dialog screens is done in a simple cartoony style that I find clashes with the rest of the game's art (Lorem for example always looks so out of place). It took me a bit to get over this. Also, it's obvious that the backgrounds are stock and were not made with the game in mind in order to keep costs down and save time. For example, I'm pretty sure most dragons in this world would not be able to sit in a restaurant booth (at all?) clearly desgined for humans. I understand the game is targeted at a small niche and only costs only $10 at full price, but I feel this won't stop it from this problem bothering most players.In regards to music, there are some nice although generic ambient tracks in here. I'll be checking out Crinkles' other work in the future.Overall I had a lot of fun with this game and am very happy with it. It has its shortcomings, but it holds a special place in my heart as a unique experience that dared to be something so strange with strong passion behind it. It's a silly dating sim in which you get to know some suspiciously human-like dragons from an alternate reality but with some mature and relatable themes. If you are interested in a unique story-driven experience and have an affinity for cartoon dragons, I think you'll find something to enjoy here. Otherwise, it's hard to know whether or not you'll enjoy this--it's too bizarre and incoherent thematically."

,Recommended,571880,29729717,Posted: 5 February,all,❄kitten clanclan❄,"(The review is first, but quick details on why the game is friendly to different sexualities, lifestyles, identities, etc. are in the comments, if you're interested. I hit the character limit and couldn't fit them into this post)Someone bought a friend of mine this game as a gift to troll him, and after watching the trailer, we thought it was corny and might get a laugh out of him playing it on the big screen. Having played several visual novels, already (mostly on console or handheld, I'm not big on PC), I somewhat knew what to expect and was curious about how this game would handle its premise. I mostly expected it to be laughable, semi-pornographic bait, and was ready for it to be either amusingly bad or over-the-top in obviousness of how badly the creator would have been attracted to their own characters.Instead, I was treated to a much more thoughtful and wordy experience than I could have expected. Within an hour of him starting his game, I was already asking him to stop so I could go and play a copy I'd just bought, privately. For the next few days, I was hooked, spending huge portions of my day playing it and finding myself deeply involved in both its story and characters. I kind of ended up falling in love with the game, and it's arguably my favorite visual novel, at this point (provided you don't consider Shu Takumi games visual novels, just adjacent to them).Angels with Scaly Wings is a visual novel that is a tad more verbose, grounded, and dry than many of its peers, but I feel this ultimately works in the game's favor, in some ways. I know it may sound ridiculous to call a game with a muscular Dragon wearing a police badge around his neck who you can engage in relations with ""grounded,"" but I genuinely believe its characters to be far more founded in realistic, down-to-earth personalities than that of comparable games who typically lean toward ridiculous exaggerations of their personality types. While most other VN's with dating sims element reduce their characters to their appropriate ""type"" (i.e. tsundere, genki, nerdy), I feel like this one had a lot more depth and facets to its characters, should you be willing to sit through a lot of relatively ordinary conversation with them.For many, I'm sure this means they'll complain about the characters being either too boring or too uninteresting (I'm sure some will call the characters by their stereotypes - alcoholic cop, clumsy introvert, etc.), but I feel this is because the game is more focused on fleshing out the characters through dialogue and companionship than it is defining them through larger-than-life events you'll experience, together. Despite an overarching plot that contains a lot of intense drama, most of your time spent with the characters defines them through mundane experiences. You're never offered particularly dramatic moments to prove yourself to them, and your relationships are strengthened almost exclusively through emotionally compatible dialogue.For me, this is a wonderful change of pace and allows me to feel closer to the characters - it's almost as if they were people I knew. For most people who play games to feel constantly empowered, I feel like this might leave them cold and having less empathy towards the characters because of the lack of forced drama allowing them easy opportunities to feel more superficial connection. For example, another visual novel might allow you an opportunity to stand up to a bully to protect an introvert and use that as a point of bonding with them - in Angels with Scaly Wings, however, simple opportunities to quickly build character like that are largely absent and replaced with lots of talking about yourselves.For everything you see in the world that doesn't initially make sense, you'll tend to get a (generally lengthy) explanation for it. Dragons using human-looking furniture and buildings was rather ridiculous to me, at first, and something I was having trouble dismissing, even though it was likely just an excuse for environmental art to be easier. It does end up being explained with well thought out reason, however, and so do most other indescrepencies and loose ends. It tends to do so in casual dialogue with characters more than it does in huge exposition dumps, leading a lot of it to feel naturally explained to the player, rather than beaten over their head - of course, there are still some large exposition dumps.Like many visual novels, this one tends to work on a mechanic that revolves around restarting your experience with minor knowledge of previous events, and it uses this narrative device much the same way that other games that use this do. If this is something that tires you, by now, I can't say that you're really going to be turned around on the concept. I understand why they used it, however, and feel like it does ultimately end up adding to the story - but this is a personal feeling, and at the same time, I feel like it's almost impossible to use a device like this perfectly elegantly. Subsequent playthroughs become more about dating, and lose a significant amount of the grip that the drama had their first time around, because you're skipping through what you've already seen. The game is, at least, very good about its skip features.I found the art done for the game to be perfectly adequate, and didn't find problems with the quality differences being jarring, as some others seem to have. The dragons are cute, the detailed transitions in more serious moments are nice despite the obvious change in artists, and, overall, I felt it to be a largely pleasing game from a visual standpoint. Full disclosure, here - I'm a furry, and though not really a particularly big fan of dragons, I do like them. Whether or not you think this indicates a bias is up to you, but I've played through several visual novels I've enjoyed despite not liking the character designs (I nearly loathe the modern anime aesthetic, especially how it depicts women), and feel like I would have still greatly enjoyed this with worse art or human characters.The music is also surprisingly good, and there's a shocking variety in the amount of tunes to keep things from ever getting stale. Some compositions feel like they were banged in an hour or two while a few others feel as if they had more work put into them, but the sheer number tends to ensure that if you don't like a few songs, you're going to be rarely hearing them, anyway. Many lower budget visual novels often suffer for trying to find someone to score their game and end up losing a lot in terms of mood, but there's a definitive victory scored here in terms of both quantity and quality.Ultimately, I feel like you should pick the game up or give it a chance if gripping, somewhat slow-moving drama with surprisingly rounded characters is your type of thing. Or, y'know, if dragons are your thing. Cuz this game's sure as hell got dragons. I honestly found myself growing significantly more fond of the concept of dragons over the course of playing the game, and felt like the overall tone of Angels with Scaly Wings was one of compassion and empathy. More importantly, it's about such sensitive things without constantly beating it over your head, and it develops them slowly, subtly, and for me, ultimately more meaningfully. While there are moments that player avatar compassion feel forced, and the game obviously leans toward you doing good, I feel like this doesn't diminish the work put towards those positive feelings being ultimately genuine and with more depth than its peers."

Instead I was completely blown away by how amazing this game turned out to be. I found myself very invested in the characters and determined to find every ending, and I'm happy to say that I succeeded on that. While I believe I've found every secret this game has to offer, I can easily see myself replaying it again in the future. I'd happily buy DLC or a sequel if more content is availible some day, and I'll definitely look out for games from this developer in the future.Also, Remy is the best dragon and none of you can convince me otherwise."

Romance isn't forced on you, you can fully complete the game without romancing any dragons should that be unappealing, and it's still well worth it without being interested in this aspect.   Not much more I can say that hasn't been covered elsewhere, definitely recommend to people looking for story and characters."

,Recommended,571880,33421532,Posted: 9 July,all,Admiral Admirable,"Just a heads-up, this is a pretty lengthy review. I got some stuff to say if you will listen.But since I'm writing a review for this game of all things, and since you're reading it, I think we both have some explaining to do, just so we're clear...It was a Summer night, 11:20 PM, and I was thinking to myself, ""Hey! You know what'd be cool right now? Game with dragons!"" Pretty normal stuff. Searched ""dragon"" and found a bunch of crappy RPGs. Then I stumbled upon this game. Now, I don't know about you, but when saw that title, I was kind of curious. I certainly didn't expect to be looking for a visual novel. But I was curious enough to click. And what I saw... well, it didn't impress me. I thought I'd found a weird sub-culture dating sim. The information about the game on the side seemed to suggest that the plot was some sort of fan-fictiony trash. But, to my confusion, it seemed to be positively received. To me, that made me think that something was up. I looked throught all of the photos, and the last one made me stop for a second. It's nothing really special: Tons of visual novels are plots involving murder. But I wouldn't expect that from a dating sim. Something was clearly going on here, so I read some reviews. They were so... positive! It seemed to indicate that this game is some sort of anomaly. Something that supposedly made people who had bought and played it as a joke very invested in the story. People who had no expectations for it found themselves brought to tears... Looking at this game, it just felt strange that it could invoke this much emotion. People praising the plot, the characters, the ideas of it all. It made me so... curious. I bought it. Now... it seems to have gone full circle. Maybe my little story there puts it a bit more into perspective. However, it doesn't tell you much about this game. So how about some of that?I can't tell you much about the story because... well, it's a visual novel. It's a book with some pictures and choices. A book with pictures and choices that can take thirty hours to completely finish reading. But I can tell you this: You might expect this story to involve lots of fantasy elements, but it doesn't. Like, not at all. Believe it or not, the plot is pretty much completely sci-fi, as odd as that sounds. But you'll find out soon enough. Telling you more is doing quite the disservice. In fact, even talking about a core part of the gameplay and story is a massive disservice! I'll leave that topic by saying that there aren't many types of these plots that are really good, or free from massive plot holes, but this one sure did it well! Now, onto the gameplay! I can't talk too much about this either because the gameplay works in tandem with the story. I'm sorry, but that's just the nature of this sort of thing! Now you play as a generic protagonist. Whenever they have control, they say mostly neutral things, but that's all fixed by the choices you make. I may have mentioned before that you make choices, and boy do you sure do make choices! Have I said choices enough to get across the point that there are branching paths in the gameplay and narrative? 'Cause there sure is! Anyway, the options given to you normally cover anything you would actually want to say in that given situation... and some other♥♥♥♥♥♥too... (Seriously, what the hell?) Also, a funny thing about those choices that the game doesn't actually warn you about: Many things you say or do can make certain characters think differently about you. That's pretty much a given, but you can actually check this in the status menu when you pause. From worst to best, the statuses are: Abandoned, bad, neutral, good, impressed. If your status with them is bad or abandoned, they won't talk to you. Just in case you wanted to know!Now, something that might be on your mind, and maybe the reason you are here: Is this a dating simulator? Whether you hope it isn't or maybe you hope it is, you wouldn't really know given what information is available on the page here. So, let me enlighten you! The answer is: Maybe. Now that's a very vague answer that deserves some explaining. Basically your asking if you can have sex with a dragon and now I'm telling you maybe? What the hell man! Ok. So, if you wanted to ""romance"" a character, you could. However, you can only get that option if you really, really tried. And you don't even have to. The game never forces you into romantic situations. But, if you really want, you sure can try. Basically, it's your choice! Don't worry about accidently getting... intimate, because it would be very difficult to do so by accident. You'd have to know a character very well, and at that point you could choose not to get anywhere close if you don't want to. However, even if you do it by accident, you can ALWAYS turn them down. You might worry that this will make them hate you, but nah. Nothing wrong with just being friends. Anywho, if you really went for it, you could. But the option is always yours. Then end goal isn't to get into romantic situations, and you can one-hundred percent complete the game without ever being romantic. No endings rely on it.Speaking of endings, this game has quite a few. That means you gotta play the game over and over and over again to get all of them. You might be thinking, ""Wow Admiral, that sounds really boring! I already beat the game and now I have to do it ALL over again to get the ending I want? Ugh!"", but hold onto that thought for a second, Sonny Jim! On subsequent playthroughs, you have the option to skip straight to the nitty-gritty. You can skip through areas with lots of branching dialogue chains that won't tell you much more about the plot if you've already read them. Speaking of already read, you can also skip right to important choices and new stuff. This takes away all of the tedium that would otherwise be involved with playing the game all over again. Of course, you could just play over again without skipping anything at all to get every dialogue option, but you have the choice at any time to not.So the art is pretty decent. Better in some places, of course, but doesn't at all detract from the experience. In some places, the art and backgrounds looks... really good! You probably also don't need me to tell you the story and characters are good, but they really are. I can say NOTHING about that though. Dialogue is good too, of course, 'cause it's hard to have good story and characters when the dialgue and text sucks. One more thing: The music in this game works really well. I know I'm saying ""really"" a lot, but I have to get the point across suffeciently. The music sounds great and sets the tone perfectly. I certainly wouldn't mind buying the OST someday.Now, just one final note: This isn't a very happy game. There's a whole lotta murder happening here. Kinda important. And people will die. All our beloved characters have at least one way to have their lives brutally ended. In fact, YOU have a few ways to die. You don't have as much plot armor as you think, bud! Be careful! With characters dying and suspicion thrown around, you'd have never thought it would come from this of all games. Looks like a bloody happy dating sim, but now all of my friends are dead! Even the happy endings involve severe tragedy! But with a way for everyone to die, you'd think that it would just be misery all around. Not completely though. Everyone's deaths can be prevented with the right courses of action. That's right, your choices matter here too! Crazy right?And that, finally, is all I have to say, and hopefully, all I need to say for you to decide whether to buy it or not. I've never written a review this long or this heartfelt, but I just had to, as you can probably tell. There really is nothing quite like this out there! And I didn' expect to enjoy this game nearly as much as I did. Funny how these things work out. Thanks for humoring me!"
76561198004354107,Recommended,571880,30765960,Posted: 26 March,all,Rurikredwolf,"Somehow managed to kill two love interests and a few children in under 4 hoursEdit: Finished game, time for final thoughtsTL;DR edition:Pros:+Characters+Interesting way of how dragons are presented+Multiple Endings+Depressing as ♥♥♥♥+When allowed to show, the plot is interesting.+THE SKIP MECHANICCons:-Some of the endings are too rushed or aren't satisfying.-The plot is jumbled-Too much telling, not showing-Writing seems a bit amateurish at times-Could have used more artLONG VERSION:This is both one of the best yet clumsy told stories I've ever experienced. I don't make that statement lightly, as I am in such conflict over this. Honestly, this game is something of an enigma to me. For every good thing it does, something that could have been improved on is in the next door.I'll start with the negatives first, as to end it on a high note.The most glaring of the problems with this story comes from the fact that it's too reliant on you seeing different endings and there is too much telling. Like, if you were to see one ending, and then get another, you have vastly different outcomes. In a bad way. I feel like this game was made to have an order in which you get the endings for first, as some of them explain things you already know or something along that line.When it does get going, however, there is too much telling. The most infamous scene people seem to know about is when you first talk with The Administrator, who goes on an 15-30 minute plot dump. And its black screen, so you have no interesting pictures to look at. It's like reading a book – which this is supposed to obviously be – but it's presented as a game. A visual medium. So staring at a black screen forever made me want to slam my head in the desk. I was streaming this entire game, and I wasn't the only one who felt this way.In fact, that's the biggest problem with the narration; the black background parts. Each character has a scene or two where you figure out their biggest secret, and its told in the same way The Administrator drones on in. Thankfully, not as long, but its still a glaring oversight. A picture or two to show what was going on would have vastly improved the weight it was trying to carry.On the subject of art, some of the drawings are a bit awkward in angles. The most glaring I can think of is one of Remy's and the one in Anna's good ending. A bit more polish and it would have looked good. I understand perspective issues, and for the most part it works, but some should have had a bit more editing.Same with the writing. For the most part, its good (I'll get into that more later). However, there are times where it could have been edited more. There is one part of Bryce's third date where every sentence or two has the word 'even' in it. And this went on for at least five minutes worth of dialogue. Being a writer myself – and no I'm not going to take the high-ground – I have the same issues with that word. Everyone has one of those words, but a bit more editing would have really helped. I'm not going to nitpick every spelling mistake, either, as on a whole it wasn't too noticeable.Finally, some of the endings flat out didn't work. Both of Lorem's endings were rather blah, and I oddly found Adine's bad ending to be much better than her good ending. I won't go into spoilers, but when you see them, you'll understand my point. In addition, once you get said endings, you just forget about the character. And if one is to die during anther's dates, they won't act like they died. It's a lack of continuity in some areas that makes it stand out.Something I should mention that doesn't really count as a negative is that some things are really obtuse to get. To get Anna's good ending, you have to do something you'd think might♥♥♥♥♥♥her off. Or get all the way to date three with Remy. Getting the good ending for Remy is also near impossible on a first playthrough. However, that is part of the fun. It's just that it could have been a bit more telegraphed in some areas. At least, that's how I felt.Now, for the good parts.The five main characters are five points in their own. Each of them are interesting in some way and they are different enough to leave a lingering impression. My favorites were Anna and Bryce, but I certainly didn't hate any of them. The only one that dragged on in locations was Lorem, but that was mostly his second date and I had already seen some of the stuff it was implying.Each of them have their own problems and situations you gotta address, too. Mostly because if you don't, they all die. And yes, it is possible to kill them all. I liken it to the gif where the guy comes in with the pizza to chaos, except it has all the characters dying in their respective ways. They are all romanceable (even if I only managed to do it with Anna and Bryce).They all have different endings, as previously said. The best ones I found were Anna's. Her good ending is downright depressing. It left me cold and hurt, as any good story should with the situation she has. It even managed to overcome the back screen of doom I mentioned before! Remy and Bryce's good endings were also quite good, with the former's bad ending also being very depressing.I really cannot stress this enough, though; for all of the faults I have with the game, these characters are so interesting that I want to go back and explore each and every option with them to find any hidden details.Something to help you get to the true ending is the ability to skip past scenes. Sometimes, you don't want to do it. But it helps you save a bunch of time on subsequent playthroughs. As such, it's not as big of a problem to get everyone's endings.Finally, the way the dragons are explained is very interesting. I won't give it away, but it made a lot of sense. When it isn't plot dumping you, the plot itself is interesting and the way they explain the resets to get each character's endings is clever.Now, before I give my grade, I want to explain how I do this. For me, a 5 out of ten means its average. Not bad, but probably not something you'd tell your friends about. Anything above it is above average. I don't like the way game reviews are these days, where if its under a seven it's absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥With that said, I give this a 6.5. Each character is easily worth one point. However, the flaws with this game/story are too glaring to ignore. With a bit more polish, and possible patches, I think this could really shine."

Sprinkle with relatively well-written scifi and a dash of (PG-13, optional) furry wish fulfillment.  While it never quite reaches the highs of any of these games, it is a competent if not astounding title that was obviously made with heart.The main characters are also surprisingly three-dimensional and believable considering they're anthropomorphic reptiles.And yes, you will be gay for Bryce."
,Recommended,571880,29803765,Posted: 9 February,all,❄FurryIceDragon❄,"Okay, just a couple of things I wanna say about the game:= First off, let's say that if you're an avid fan of dragons/reptilians or likewiseGET THE GAME THIS INSTANT= And it's huge, believe me. (Or at least it's bigger than what you might think it is). Either way don't let the trailer trick you.= Seriously you can spend days on this game and eventually grow pretty attached to it= The game will also send you into one big emotional rollercoaster, rocking you up and down making you wonder whether you have packed your stuffs for that feel trip(that was so bad, I'm sorry xD)= Overall: 10/10= For a 10-buck game I can say it's worth it (at least to me)'Aight so let's move on to some pros and cons:+ The plot is just ... wow. I gotta say it'sbig.+ Charles Dickens should be proud of how good it thickens.+ The artworks are just decent+ The ingame arts are even better as they reflects the mood of each characters pretty well- On a side note,Remy seems to be blushing in situations he shouldn't be blushing, uh...+ The music (might not) seem very impressive / memorable at first, but it fits the feels perfectly and you may just grow to like it before you know.+Check out Zhong's records, tho. Maybe those tracks could change your mind about the music entirely+ The skip mode is pretty neat and awesome- The transition between ingame art and cutscene art is quite bugged?- Or sometimes when you're skipping, the animation on the cutscene/background art will keep going while the ingame art stays still.+ The characters are pretty unique+ Like, can't you see how adorable / handsome / beautiful they are?+Would go gay for Bryce any time-How come I can't date Sebastian? He's a rather cute guy for a police officer <3+ I love how the game deals with some of the more... unconventional matters.Probably to keep the protagonist gender-neutral. Andthere are no pornographical materials, you perv. Unless you count a censored pic as one.+ I also love how a lot of lifestyles / identities / orientations are presented in the game. Kinda like how all the characters come from different walks of life, but regardless they're still treated the same (based on their personalities, of course. Eg. you're hated for being a jerk, not because of who/what you are.otherwise you're pretty much screwed since you're a human and not a dragon like the rest of them)+ It's much like our world. Or rather, the dragon version of our world, just certainly more peaceful.That's it for now. I haven't fully cleared the game yet but I'm working on it.And this game is amazing like seriously"

76561198037648448,Recommended,571880,34268213,Posted: 15 August,all,Anachronity,"If you are interested enough in this game to be reading these reviews, then I feel utterly obligated to convince you to buy this game.This really can't be called a dating simulator even though it does cater to that crowd. Instead this is a very character-oriented choose your own adventure soft sci-fi novel. In fact, it is literally the best sci-fi novel I've ever read (and I've read a sizeable number).Hmm? You don't trust a random stranger on the internet?Well, I almost didn't buy it because of the name. Now here I am writing a lengthy review for it that my friends and family may or may not see and make certain... assumptions. Even more, I don't actually like visual novels that much, it's really just that good.I'll limit any spoilers to whatever is covered in pre-game narration or in the screenshots above, or else I'll vaguely describe a few things that you will find out regardless of the choices you make and which aren't intended to be a surprise in any way. Be assured, this is the sort of game that you don't want spoiled.First, the 'dating' elements...A very good comparison for this Mass Effect: there is some flirtitious dialogue and highly seductive poses but with no explicit material (I actually don't even think there is any swearing in this game). If you take things any farther then you get a fan service image with artistic censorship where necessary, then the camera fades to black and the rest is strongly implied. I actually don't think it's possible to go that far with all of the main characters, and it's pretty clear from an early point that, while the characters are unusually amorous and blush with startling frequency, this is not the full breadth of what this game has to offer.Next, the setting...Why the author chose dragon-people in particular baffles me slightly, but it's clear a hell of a lot of thought was put into their society. They explore the full ramifications of their different physiologies. It goes so far as to even explain why, for example, the doors you see in the screenshots above are still human-sized even though many of the dragons hunch or are quadrupedal. One of the ongoing mysteries from the very start of the game is how their society could possibly be so similar to our own.As far as being a sci-fi novel, it is very clear that the author(s) did their research. While not completely ironclad, their explanations for how things work are at the very least convincing and often close to our actual understanding of things. If you're comfortable not overanalyzing, for example, a movie like Star Wars or The Minority Report, then you're going to be able to suspend your disbelief here.As for the characters...They all display impressive depth-of-character relative to the amount of 'screen' time they are given. All of them have very realistic flaws and insecurities and very admirable strengths. What's more impressive is that all of their interactions with other characters and their place in the setting are very natural and appropriate. Particularly given the extreme degree of...PLAYER AGENCY!!!Agency, or the ability of the player to control the flow of the story (e.g. who you decide to save, kill, or♥♥♥♥♥♥off, as well as what happens that would not otherwise have happened as a result). True agency is impossible to achieve in videogames with complicated storylines, so there are always compromises.Some games try to eschew storyline in favor of a sandbox approach, and are typically procedurally generated. These games generally don't have good depth, or else have a single deep-but-linear storyline amidst many shallow side quests. Other games have a single fascinating story which gives you some leeway, but which always has certain events transpire regardless of your choices. There is no avoiding this, to at least some degree.That is where this game is truly astonishing; the degree of interconnection between your many, many possible choices and the events of the story are as flawless as feasibly possible. There are not just many endings, there are many in-betweens. There is a staggering amount of content in this game that you may very well never see, just so that the content you *do* see on even your third or fourth playthrough can be somewhat unique. What's more, the game has a very intuitive set of UI tools which allow you to skip ahead past parts you've already seen and explore new dialogue trees, making repeated playthroughs very unfrustrating. This game gives you a level of agency in the developing story which I have frankly never seen before."

All the characters are fantastic and lovable from the silly dating scenes right down to their deep secrets they confide to you. Admittedly I bought this ""because I'm gonna date the dragons, dammit,"" and was slowly drawn in and amazed by how deep the world was. It has such good replayability with how many choices you can make and trying to uncover all the different endings, and I found myself unable to put it down until I got the happy ending I was looking for.To everyone who might be looking at it saying ""I want this as a silly thing so I can date dragons and laugh,"" I highly recommend getting it because it offers so much more while still giving you what you want.As a silly side note, I 100% have the hots for Bryce and will date him as many times as I replay the game."

Sure we're a human and their a dragon but if gender was an issue it would have been pretty interesting lol (personal prefrences)Note: You have one chance to make a name and never change it (for those of you who care about that)."

You could call it a bias, but I don't even connect to foxes (my favorite animal) anywhere close to as with dragons. Dragons in games are important to me, and this is no exception.The writing (as a writer myself) is top-notch. The story is woven delicately to tell a story of multiple main characters. It truly unfolds when you play the True Ending (by getting all 5 good endings, one with each main character).The characters are all loveable and have personalities that are enjoyable. Even with characters such as Maverick,who seems to hate you for most of the gameI just wanna give him a big hug and say I'm sorry he feels the way he does. I can't say which dragon is my favorite because all 5 are so close in different aspects. I've fallen in love with all of them...The illustrations are beautiful, and the backgrounds are detailed. Even the backgrounds (why they use buildings, chairs, etc) are explained by a plot element. All the gallery pictures, dragon faces (especially when they blush!) are so charming and heart-warming.The game isn't all sunshine and rainbows, though. It's possible for every character to die, sometimes in multiple ways. If you want the true ending... you'll see your favorite dragon die. More than once. It's heart-wrenching, and it hurt me a lot to see, but... I can say that in the end, the outcome is worth it.The Skip function makes your second and consecutive playthroughs way faster because it stops the text at any decision and at any text you haven't seen before. You don't have to worry about skipping things you've seen or redoing the large parts of the game if you're going for certain endings.Different timelines, replaying the game over and over again, is a part of the game. You have to unfold the whole story and every outcome before the True Ending can be unveiled. Like with Undertale's true ending, if you play this game... play it to the end. Get the True Ending (even if you have to use guides!) and you'll thank me.I love this game so much that I bought the deluxe edition for the soundtrack/extras, the level 5 badge, the foil badge (which cost me $200) to proudly show on my page forever, and I got every achievement in the game, making Angels With Scaly Wings my FIRST and ONLY perfected game on Steam.Do yourself a favor: buy this game. It's a rollercoaster of emotion, and for a game made from a kickstarter campaign (and only 10,000 pounds) you would be surprised how good the quality can be. I'll take games like this over huge 100 million dollar Triple A games any day!We need more beautiful, touching games like this."

Well, the answer to this is under the spoiler tag below.The answer would be... two, as far as I see.  Well, kinda.  You don't actually SEE anything.  Only two of the main dragon characrers have this, but only if you have them Impressed on Chapter 4.  A third one only has an innocent shower scene.While the scenes don't really show anything, it can still look suggestive/lewd.  The game simply leaves anything unseen to your imagination.  Dragons don't wear clothes anyway.  Well, most don't.After you have a final dialogue choice with them, the screen fades to black and goes to Chapter 5.  Once again, use your imagination on what actually happened.I recommend this game.

,Recommended,571880,30367104,Posted: 6 March,all,Lyra9852 🐦 🐉,"Going to refer to Hatoful Boyfriend a bit since that is the only other dating sim/visual novel that i play to completion and bought on steamFirst of all if you consider yourself a scalie or just like dragons, I highly recommend this game.One thing i like about this game is how there is an ingame reason why your character goes back to the start after each endingAnother thing I like is how the player's gender is never stated so you can make it whatever you want it to beThe story I felt like was a little like Hatoful Boyfriend's, where humanity is on the brink of destruction so they send one human to represent the race and see if both species can live together. While Angels with scaly wings doesn't follow that exactly it does seem similar.The characters are for the most part cute and have quite a bit to them to make sure they stand out.One of the things I didn't like about this were the endings. Compared to Hatoful Boyfriend's, the endings are really lacking in making them feel really different from each other. The real difference between the ending are which character shows up, other than that they take place in the same place and usually end up the same way, especially the bad endings.A feature that is in other visual novels is the skip/fast forward. While im not sure how other visual novels use this besides, Hatoful boyfriend's where it's just a fast forward that will go through all text and stop at a choice or scene change, this game uses both skipping and fast forward. The skip is very useful on repeat playthroughs when getting endings but can be annoying when trying to get everything because when you skip if you got the good choices, it will automatically pick those if it involves a character. The fast forward is useful when getting all endings and achievements since it will stop at any choice and it will also stop when you get dialog you didn't see before no matter how small it may be.The music is good but not exactly memorable . It's there as background noise and to help with whatever mood the game is making. While compared to Hatoful boyfriend, each character has their own music which, even though it's just stock music, really helps the characters stand out.Overall I would recommend this game especially if you don't look see this as a buy it as a joke game and just see it as a visual novel where almost all the characters are dragons instead of the generic anime girl who has boobs."

Not just the major ones but so do the minor ones and you can even have a meeting with these minor dragons and see more of their character.+Both the plot and world building of this game is finely turned. The world feels like it's a world tailored for dragons rather than just the dragons you see and the plot has an interesting mystery behind it that further unravels hidden depths with each ending.-The backer characters and creator made characters are a bit different in art style making them stand out a bit too much. It's only minor compared to the other two flaws though...-The protagonist is overall a weak character. I can understand what the creator was going for, he was trying to go for a midpoint between a vague character which the player can project themselves into and a defined character with a distinct background and personality. This backfired, the protagonist knows things and has plans the player doesn't which increases the disconnect and with the character not being too defined to make them more relatable, we overall have a flat main character we feel more like we're a guide to rather than in the role of. And while visual novels can usually get away with a faceless protagonist, there are two incidents in the game which would favoured the protagonist having an avatar.-The last issue is linked to the final ending of the game. While most endings have good payoff, the last one does not answer enough questions raised by the game. This was ripe for a ""Where are they now"" ending that would fit perfectly! Hopefully an update in the future fixes this issue. (I won't go into too much issue about this issue as that would be major spoilers)Overall, this is one of the better visual novels I have played no question but it's hard to get the two noticeable flaws out of my mind. I do recommend giving this game a go though, especially if you're a dragon fan!"
,Not Recommended,571880,29665533,Posted: 3 February,all,Dragon,"UPDATE: Alright, I grinded the game some more, and I have realized that the game's characters do certainly have some depth to them. However, my negative review still does not change as I have a very hard time seeing someone who isn't a furry having an emotional attraction to a dragon (It's like asking a furry to have a relationship with a human.) This game would best belong on another platform other than Steam, and I believe the price is incredibly high, shown namely in the mediocre art styles and free music as the soundtrack, when the developer raised well over 10k euro on IndieGoGo alone. A smaller price would be better accepted, maybe around $5 USD. The story is predictable, so buy this game if you want a dragon dating sim.Above all, this game confuses me.As a rather avid fan of dragons, I picked this game up release day not knowing what to expect. Well, I did expect a rather generic visual novel with dragons as the main interactions in game. And I did get mostly that.However, this game has some really nice storyline work, and while it is a very popular concept (You're thrown into another world with a huge conflict to solve, and you can either save it or f*ck all of the NPCs) the developer uses dragons as actual story elements, and even though there isn't a lot of depth in the story, it doesn't feel like a cash grab.Artwork in general is praise-worthy. Most of the drawings look great, especially the backdrops. I'm not too fond of the faded-out looking backdrops of typical visual novels. In this game, you get a sense of where you actually are, so not all of the attention is focused on the characters.And now for the bad bits. While the art is nice, it awkwardly switches styles at sometimes. While I do understand that this was to put less of a burden on the artist and add more character expressions at a lower price, it's rather annoying. The soundtrack is nothing special and I certainly wouldn't consider purchasing the special edition upgrade. The characters themselves are cookie cutters. They act exactly how they look, and don't have much depth to them. The nerd is the nerd, the muscle is the muscle. Finally, the main issue I have with this game is that it doesn't do too much to stand out.Without the dragons, this visual novel would be nothing.Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game. Despite my love for dragons, most of the characters failed to grab my attention. Like I said before, dragons are what this game uses to stand out, and yet at the same time they are its biggest flaw. I applaud the developers for putting so much time into this game, but they put that time into making a dating sim and less of a ""compelling sci-fi visual novel.""So why am I confused? I don't know who this game is trying to appeal to, the average visual novel player, or the furries and scalies. If itistrying to appeal to the latter, the store page certainly doesn't sound like it. Also, a lack of story depth will dissapoint."

,Recommended,571880,29787521,Posted: 8 February,all,Xanderg,"TL;DR - If you like dragons or visual novels, consider picking this game up, especially since it's not an expensive game.I completely forgot that I followed this game just over a year ago on Greenlight, it was a pleasant surprise to have been notified that it came out on steam.The game didn't ask for much in terms of price, so I figured it was worth a shot. I jumped straight into it and while I didn't know what to expect, I was hoping it'd turn out to be a great game.Turns out, I was hooked.I realize that my opinion is likely biased because I really like dragons, but the game loses out on so much if the main characters weren't dragons, the whole plot wouldn't even make much sense.The art in the game is adorable, to the point where I'd say it alone develops a sense of attachment to the characters themselves, and when you get down to it, the game tops it off with some interesting personalities for each of the characters, each one having their own lives, goals and flaws, even if they might come across as a little cliché in some cases.The music benefits the game greatly, in that it adds a sense of immersion so that it truly tries to make you feel how it wants you to feel. Some of the tracks were more memorable than others, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, what's more important is that it suits the situation well and that you don't feel like the game loses its flow as a result.The choices you make in this game do make a difference, and I appreciate the writing in that regard, not every dialogue option is meaningful, but given certain circumstances, going down a certain path could make the difference between life and death for a character, or whether or not you get a good ending out of it.Some plotholes do exist within the game, but all things considered, the game does a really good job at explaining everything so you get an idea of the big picture, to the extent where you could even consider it thorough.Overall, I haven't felt this attached to a game in a rather long time, I tried to immerse myself into this game as best as I could, and it paid off more than I thought.There are a couple things that affect the game in a negative way, but they are comparitively minor to the experience that you're given, it's well thought out and I enjoyed every moment of it.I wouldn't classify this game as a must-have, rather a ""must-consider"" if you will, as it might not appeal to everyone, but that simply depends on whether you like these kinds of games or not. If you do, then it's unlikely you'd be disappointed."

Was looking for a game that wasn't particularly gameplay intenseive but wanted something with a great story. I remembered that a few weeks prior that this was recommended to me for being a dragon game after recently playing Skyrim. At the time I just brushed it off, as something that probably wasn't very good, but it had caught my eye. I was bored, and said, ""♥♥♥♥ it. I'll buy it."" It was a great decision. Blew through the game in 3 days. I just had to see every ending right away.  The characters are just so lovable and the story was just so not what I expected, catching me off guard at the best of times. I would love to see the community grow, so I implore people to try it out. Also, Remy best dragon."

Forget that it's called a dating sim, tho it has elements of that and is closest to that in description, I'm getting my heart wrenched from bad stuff happening again and again and again and again. Despite this, despite each good ending that I'm getting, I am propelled to keep playing, to find that perfect path where I don't have to see a death, where each character that I grew close to just.... avoiding spoilers but... god damn. I can't even blame the estrogen on this feels trip.This game may not be katawa shoujo in how well constructed the art is or the varying postures (would be nice, but apparently was way above par for the course) but the feels I'm getting here are just as strong, and that's why I like them both... onward, to the undertale ending!10/10, would be determined again."

Brilliant dracoform variety; An understanding of the mythology surrounding them, and the nature of mythology and religion in general; Rounded characters that compel you to think of them as real; And just enough mystery to inspire your intellectual curiosity without needless frustration.It's a grand thing. And it's a dating simulator. It's a dating simulator that feels a heck of a lot more intelligent than Game of Thrones. I don't know how to feel about that, though it is how I feel about it.It's not for xenophobes or equally shallow thinkers, mind you, as it'll alienate the living heck out of them. I know there's at least one article out there where it's expressed that the writer just found it too strange to be dating a dragon. It's important to know if you're this game's audience. If you are, you'll love it.I do think it requires at the very least a modicum of open-mindedness. With that, though, you're going to have a marvellous time! I'd say that with as much exuberant confidence as this title's own Chief of Police himself. There's so much variety of character, here!It's pleasing to me. I find that my partner and I have been talking more about it than any other game we've played in the past number of months.I just hope you can enjoy it as much as we did. From one open mind to hopefully another, I can't recommend this enough. I really can't. And I'd even say to go with the digital deluxe edition, they really do deserve it.I'd raise a giant bowl of liquor to these developers! Good show!"

The game delivered above and beyond what I expected and kept me hooked on the story.  I'd recommend it to anybody who likes any combination of dragons, sci-fi, or visual novels, and has an open mind or sense of humor enough to handle dating dragons as a thing that happens.  The game never really reaches beyond PG-13, although in some cases more is implied.+Story is excllent, with a unique concept for a world+Characters are likeable and varied.+Visual aesthetic is very good, although the art in (literally) one or two cases could use some work+Controls and User Interface are well optimized for all kinds of play, from first-time player to completionist.=Almost all characters are dragons, including all main [dateable] characters-Some of the things required to get -all- the secrets are a little obtuse.

,Recommended,571880,29647683,Posted: 2 February,all,Sect The Wayward Astalos,"The storytelling is AMAZING in this game, and to me emotionally, it dwarfed games that I had tried before such as Morenatsu. Each character feels different and alive, and the decisions you make in this game feel like they have a lot more weight to them.The plot was well thought out and there is a lot to love from this game. I won't go into spoilers but in the end, this is a game that is an amazing story, but very punishing if you weren't paying attention. And to be honest, that is not a bad thing.The only downside to it is a few things are difficult to understand. (Ah, Multi-verse theory's a ♥♥♥♥♥)But I do have to recommend this game for those who like visual novels, Mystery games, Dragons, or just want a fun game with a ton of unlockables for the low price of $10.-EDIT-After playing through enough to finally get an ending that satisfied me, I have to say that this game tormented me for the better. I honestly felt like I could let go of my own past as I played through it. I made new friends. In a way, this game helped me sort out my life in a way I never thought possible.And even through all the heartbreaking moments that tore me asunder I have to say ""Thank you so much"" To the devs and the community. But now, looking back on the adventure... it leaves me feeling a bit empty inside... almost as if I need more.the truth of the matter is that this game is simply a work of art. Not only does it tick the boxes of good expectations, but the characters are simply amazing. You feel emotionally invested in them. and the problems in the world can be easily acknowledged in our society today... the game takes a lot of real world problems and really shows you the devastating effects to such a degree that... it really hurts.If a sequel ever becomes a thing... my money is ready."
,Recommended,571880,29733550,Posted: 5 February,all,Dr. Gonepostal298,"(This is my first real review, so its not going to be perfect. I apologise.)This was quite a surprising game to be honest. I obtained the game as a gift from a friend, though I would've bought it myself too as the game has motherfrickin' dragons in it. I've never played a visual novel before, so I went in expecting it to be something like the infamous Hunie Pop, as it was the closest thing I had to it. Boy was I wrong though.Angels with Scaly Wings started off with a simple yet interesting premise, before quickly blossoming into something much more complex. The characters were wonderful to intereact with. Sure, they aren't anything unique, but the game made me love and respect them. The art style was appealing and cute, and overall I was very invested in the game.For those who don't want minor spoilers, I'll say my overall review here. I'd give it a good 9/10, as it genuinely made me feel things, and I yearn for more. Happily, the developers hinted at more being made, so who knows. If you're a person who likes dragons, or likes getting a bit deep in lore, or even likes getting attached to characters, I'd recommend this game to you.-Minor spoilers from here on, mainly pointers of what you'll be getting into-Now, these aren't major spoilers or anything, but if you want to go into the game completely blind, then don't read on. So, one thing I didn't realize at first is: You will not get the best ending the first try. In order to get the best ending, you have to keep playing until you have every character's good ending. Another thing: The game will toy with your emotions if you like these characters. It is NOT kind in this regard, and will screw with your feelings. The story will quickly spiral into something much more complex than it originally seemed like through little exposition moments, so you'll want to pay attention if you want to remember it all. Thats about all I can suggest, really. I hope this helps you in your endeavors if you plan on playing this cute, yet cruel little game!"
76561198030690472,Recommended,571880,29685732,Posted: 3 February,all,maestro,"Angels with Scaly Wings is a game that I've quickly grown to enjoy, in my somewhat short time with it.I can't say I've played a lot of visual novels, or dating sims, but I would have to say that I enjoyed this particular one. I came to see the dragons, and I have had a rather enjoyable experience with it. First off, let's start with the usual ratings:GraphicsFirst off, I will say that the backgrounds are rather well-drawn, with nice vivid colors. The characters' artwork might not be top-notch quality that you'd find coming from popular artists at, say, DeviatArt or other similar gallery sites but I found them to be very reasonable and pleasant. The ""cartoon"" style fits well enough, and outside of Reza, it is nice to see very little if any anime influence (nothing against anime, I just feel it is overdone).Score: 8/10SoundMost of the audio in the game that you will hear, is ambient soundtracks, though there are sound effects that are sparsely added in during some scenes. The sound effects are about what one would expect (though the gunfire sounds a bit quiet and distant, even if it should be close-by). The music, though... there were a few earworm-ish tracks in the game that I rather enjoyed, and even those I didn't notice straight away were pleasant enough. No complaints here.Score: 8/10Controls/GameplayThere's not much to say on this subject, because this is a Visual Novel afterall, however I did find the Skip Feature to be cool, it allows you to replay the game without having to spend hours reading large text dumps of things you've already seen. The only thing I wish they had done, was give us a rewind ability, or the ability to replay a chapter if we screwed up, or forgot something but that's a minor issue. It isn't too hard to be lazy for the rest of the playthrough if you missed something, and if you use a lot of skips, you can get through a whole playthrough in <5 minutes so I suppose it isn't too big of an issue.Score: 7/10DifficultyIt's not easy to try to rate the difficulty of a Visual Novel, however with this being a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" type deal, there is a small amount of difficulty in figuring out how to get each character's Good Ending. Some of them, from the sounds of a guide I leafed through, are somewhat obtuse. I'm going to avoid spoilers here, but the game makes it clear from early on that there's never a situation in which you are going to die outright. Other people you care about.... well, that's a different story. I feel that the game isn't too easy, but yet isn't too hard either, even if I feel that some of the puzzles are a little on the obtuse side. But then if you check every single possible combination of things you're allowed to say, you'll eventually suss it out. It's more of a battle against your patience, really.Score: 7/10StoryI saved the most important bit for last: the game's story. Average players who aren't passionate about Visual Novels should enjoy the game's story for what it is, but enthusiasts and hardcore story people might not like the plot holes the game presents. It is difficult to explain without spoilers, but the game places you (or, well, the character you play as) in a position where the player might wish to do something that he/she knows he/she should be able to do, but the game simply does not allow that option (it could be difficult to code? Don't know the reason). This opens up a plot hole, because to be quite honest, the in-game charactershouldbe able to do the things the player would think up of... but can't, because the game doesn't give the choices to do it.Some of the game's events would/should be hugely affected by this, to the point if it weren't for limitations with the game itself, the entire story could be turned upside down if only the game would allow.However, I don't think that is such a huge deal, but people who are hugely into story and don't like plot holes might not enjoy that aspect as much. I'm willing to hand-wave it, but YMMV.Score: 8/10OverallIs it worth $9.99? Well, that depends on two things:1). Do you respect work that is put into a game?2). How much do you value $10?The artwork and music alone is easily worth $10. You can tell the game's developers crafted the game with care and love, and they put forth a genuine effort to give us a game to enjoy, and a story, world, and characters that we could relate to, connect to, and immerse ourselves in. Despite the aforementioned plot holes, I found myself developing an attachment to at least a couple of the characters in it, and I find myself re-playing the game again and again working for that ""True"" Ending I know must surely be there, as I'm missing many achievements just yet.****Please read the update below.$10 these days barely gets you a lunch, but buying this game gives you a memorable experience. I would recommend it to anybody who likes dragons, who enjoys fantasy, and those who are willing to hand-wave minor imperfections in a story's plot. The game's story easily leaves enough room for you to insert your own headcanon, and I think that adds to the value of the game itself.Should you give this game a try, I do hope you will enjoy it as much as I did!UPDATE 02/05/2017: So I've played through a couple more endings, and the aforementioned ""Plot Holes"" are not actually plot holes, the reason behind the way things are is actually explained in a reasonable way in the game universe, well, kinda. I still feel there are options that are not covered, but the plot holes are nowhere near as big as I first thought. I was actually impressed that they did actually explain it, BUT, you only see this explanation in one (maybe two?) of the endings, so it is easy to miss your first time or two through the game, depending on who you take a liking to the most.UPDATE: 02/09/2017: After seeing 99.9% of the game's content, including the two secret endings, I very highly recommend this to anybody who likes visual novels or even just plain novels. This game gives you a nice vibrant world/universe, concepts, and characters that you can easily go wild creating headcanon for. This experience will remain with me for a long time, long after I've exhausted the game's content. I might come back a time or two and do another playthrough, though like many visual novels, replayability is not particularly high once you've seen all the stuff. But still, it was very fun and highly recommended for people who like this type of material."
,Recommended,571880,33024141,Posted: 29 June,all,silalus,"My god, I hope this developer never stops telling stories. I say without hyperbole they may be one of the most promising storytellers of our era. I regret not being prophetic enough to have supported their crowdfunding campaign- the community that did should be thanked by everyone else. (So for any members of that community reading this: THANK YOU, for helping this to exist.)Here's the thing... I don't like visual novels as a format at all, and I especially find so-called ""dating sims"" awkward and off-putting. Heck, in all honesty these days I'm not even a huge fan of retro adventure games or RPG's with heavy amounts of text and no voice acting. Those kinds of games just don't hold my attention anymore, and haven't for a long time.And this game is unashamedly all of those things- a simple visual novel interface, with an openly dating sim vibe, and literally over 100,000 words of text with no voice acting at all. It's basically a choose-you-own adventure book with motion comic artwork, and with a premise that's more than a little odd-sounding on top of it all.And yet this now easily is on my shortlist for one of the most unexpectedly impressive games ever.I don't seem to be unique in this. You see lots of reviews from players and critics that have either never played or, like me, even actively dislike other games superficially similar to this one- yet love it. That's a heck of an achievement.And I think it's because the game is really not much about sex or even romance, although it has some of that in it. It's not even entirely about the story, despite having a frightfully intricate one. At it's core what this game really is about seems to be exploring different types of connections that can be made between people. It's not just about finding the ""right"" thing to say or do- on the contrary the whole mechanic of the game essentially revolves around figuring out how to connect to characters on an emotional, intimate, vulnerable level. It does that really, really well... And it turns out that's really, really important to storytelling.Through the course of searching for those connections you may find yourself with tears in your eyes at 2 in the morning because of something you can't stop from happening to a 2d, non-animated, non-human character.I did.I almost feel like it shouldn't be possible, but it happened. This game really is that good."

I loved getting the chance to meet all the dragons I could talk to, each moment in a dragon's story made me laugh and smile and sometimes sniffle. Getting to know each dragon pesonally made it really hard to let go and start a new once you finish their story. Each dragon has his or her emotions and way of thinking that really shines the further you go through their story. Most of the time I felt like I was in the world solving the mystery and helping them. The game isn't perfect on account of some of the machanics, but I feel the developers did an amazing job putting the game together.

,Recommended,571880,30222951,Posted: 27 February,all,Labrafaggot,"So, I bought this game for a joke. I figured ""It's probably some cringy garbage, might as well pick it up"". While the artwork can sometimes be a little to anime-esque for my taste, the story is phenominal.What I enjoy the most about this game is how it doesn't necessarily forces interaction with the main characters, but encourages it. And when it comes to it, all the characters have their own pasts, what makes them... them. It's a touch you don't see in most run-of-the-mill visual novels. Most authors and creators have an approach of ""MAKE THIS GUY LIKE YOU, MAKE THEM HATE YOU"" etc. AWSW wraps the mystery of the story cleverly with the pasts of Bryce, Remy, Adine, Lorem, and Anna to the point where you WANT to get to know them better. And that is a key stand out for the game.You WANT to know them. You WANT to find out what is going on. You WANT to solve the mystery. But you don't technically HAVE to.All in all, this game is phenominal. After buying the original game and choking up a multitude of times, I went back and purchased the Deluxe Edition because holy HELL is the soundtrack terrific. It's one of those tracks where it works very well with the tone and style of the game, but is not offputting to listen to as a stand-alone.My verdict on this game is: Buy it. Buy it, play it, and enjoy a truly remarkable experience."

You either got this game because you're a furry/scalie, or for the lulz.There isn't much gameplay in this game with it being a Visual Novel, mainly just clicking on a choice that pop up time from time. Some of these choices don't affect the story much/at all, but some choices can have dire consquents later on.Without going in to many spoilers. The story doesn't change much each play through even if you chose different choises.Differnt dragons will die depending on what you dobut the main plot is the same, with the ending being different wether you got a good or bad ending with different characters.The characters are amazingly writen. Their hopes and dreams are interesting to read into and you can feel that a lot of thought was put into this area, which, in a visual novel, is one of the most importaint aspects to get right.The script is properly the only downside to this game, but it's not a major downside to this game. Many times the diolog felt cut off, or ended abruptly. But as far as that goes the game is very polished.There are alot of achevements in this game. Most of them are just the possiable endings that can happen while others are for completing silly little objectives. The game also throws in a few reverences including Ace Attorney (Objection!), Pokemon (I wanna be the very best), JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (But is was me __!) and a few more.Overall the game has great replay value with the amount of diferent endings there are. Interesting story line (At least for the first play through). And very interesting characters to learn about.10/10 would cry on Adine's bad ending againOverall I rate this game a 8.5/10"

76561198055363852,Recommended,571880,29795377,Posted: 8 February,all,Selias,"Overview:I'm not as infatuated with this game as other people seem to be. As much as I'd hoped to be after waiting 2 years of my life for it. I really, really wanted it to be a 10/10 game. I still like it overall, it starts off strong and does a few things right, but it falls flat halfway through and has some serious, glaring problems. Though it is important to remember that this game was basically made by one guy with outside contributions, and it's pretty good for a 1-person indie game. If you just want to buy it for the sole fact that it's the only non-vaporware dragon VN in existence, it'll be worth your money. But there's not much else keeping it afloat.Warning:Very mild first-hour spoilers ahead. Proceed as you will.The biggest issue I found with this game is one that I've seen many times before, in games like Wildstar and Abzu and every Blizzard game in the last 10 years: it doesn't know how serious it wants to be. You can already see what I'm talking about by watching the trailer video in the store page, which plays again when you start the game. The music is muted, the text is all dark and melting, and it parades a bunch of pastel cartoon dragons in front of your face, juxtaposed with ""deep"" and ""profound"" words like ""black holes"" and ""somatic barrier"" and ""refracture syndrome"" with absolutely no prior effort made to make those words actuallymeananything to the player. It just kinda struts around like it's as complex as The Great Gatsby without actuallydoinganything to earn that complexity. Honestly, the first time I saw it I burst out laughing. Compare this to the trailer for, say, Undertale. Most people who played it feel that Undertale is a really deep and touching game. Yet, you see how upbeat and ideologically humble the trailer is? Undertale was a game that worked in part because it knew how serious it wanted to be. It was self-aware of its own cartoonish nature and allowed the meaning to come out through humor and personality and breaking the 4th wall rather than trying to make things super down-to-earth and logical. And don't get me wrong, realism is an equally valid angle. But you have to go all in on it, which this game does not, as explained below.Once you get inside, the pattern continues. When you first get there, you're aliteral alien life formthat represents a scientific revolution. If that happened in our world, there would be an entire army designated to retrieving and guarding it and the portal it came from. The dragons do start off in agenerallyrealistic direction, transporting you under cover of darkness and assigning you a personal bodyguard, but then not evenone full daygoes by before they just start letting you walk around by yourself, in broad daylight, and start giving you your own authority over their intelligence department. Few if any people stop to question you. The entire police department and general populus just kinda has complete, unwavering, undeserved trust in you from day 1, even after they see the actions of the only other human on the planet.And occasionally they'll randomly flip flop back to serious, when it's convenient, like when your bodyguard can't walk you home because he has to ""write a report""""Day 3, stayed inside writing reports instead of protecting the priceless alien again"", but in general the citizens of this world don't adhere to any logical system. In fact, one of the main antagonists in the game is a ""bad guy"" for being the only cop who actually cares about doing his job and questioning what he's told.Everyonegangs up on him for it. How can I take the game seriously if even the characters themselves don't? It might seem petty, but these kinds of little details matter in order for the world to feel grounded and consistent, which is a prerequisite for a genre like murder mystery that depends on such overtones.Moving on to the next major issue. As I said in the overview, the game starts out strong by introducing you to lots of characters and environments, but after you play through it once with your favorite waifu/hazubando it begins to feel very, very empty. The general story stays exactly the same through every single character, with the only difference being a handful of personal 1 on 1 scenes with them. And then you have to go through all their bad endings, which change even less. Your character's behavior adapts very little, and the ultimate point of your being there never changes at all. Most of the important information is hamfisted to you in an excruciatingly long neutral scene on your first playthrough, with no tact whatsoever. Environments get recycled from the neutral scenes. None of the characters are interconnected for any reason that affects your present actions in the story. Ultimately it results in this hours-long meaningless grind you have to go through to see the true ending. Which, though I won't spoil, I will say was short and underwhelming and alotmore could have been done with it. It has no longevity and little growth other than the occasional extra paragraph of text.The last thing that's really wrong with it is the software itself. There are typos, even though the release was delayed an entire month explicitly to iron out things like these. There's an ""Idle Mode"" button in the main menu that doesn't actually work and doesn't check the box or do anything if you try to click it. And though this won't affect you if you're just now purchasing the game, achievements that were earned on launch day (1/31/2017) don't show up in Steam unless you reset your entire save file. And it's not my responsibility to delete everything I did just for Steam credit.Beyond that, there are some things that are either a mixed bag or just entirely neutral. For instance, the artwork at times is really good, like in the backgrounds or the gallery images that the game gives you for connecting with certain characters. Then there are things like the sergal student dudealmostknowing how to smile, or Lorem being weirdly undershaded compared to everyone else, or Remy looking like an amorphous bloodsucking worm about to consume your face in one of his personal scenes. The music is largely the uninspired gentle piano that you hear in every VN ever. The overall plot is passable and contains a couple genuinely surprising twists (the first time you hear them), but won't make you feel like you ""learned"" anything or ""changed"" at all from completing the game.Now for the things it does objectively well. Firstly, it managed to create actual in-canon continuity between individual playthroughs (even though it's only utilized to a token extent), something I've never seen before in a VN and something that was very fluidly incorporated. It also invented its own card game with classic 4 suit playing cards, or at least showcased a game I've never seen before. It had a few cute and humerous moments. And of course, it did what so many of us have been longing for for so long, what no other game was brave enough to do: satisfied our need to date dragons. The creator of this game saw that something people wanted didn't exist, got off his butt, sat back down on his butt (in front of a computer) andmadeit exist. And he actually finished it. It's easy to take that for granted now that it's all said and done, but that alone is commendable.Overall, this game is far from perfect, but I think the pros outweigh the cons and I would recommend shelling out the 10 dollarydoos to play it. For a first major game produced largely by one guy, it's amazing, and I look forward to seeing what he makes in the future (especially a sequel). Solid 6.5/10, one of the best JRPGs to ever come out of triple-A gaming.Sebastian is not fully dateable, -500/10 worst game ever made by anyone."

I went into this hoping for some romance and some neat plot. Not only did I get those, but also a legitimate rollercoaster of emotion, especially with Anna's story. I was in tears at the ending I'd recieved,even though it was noted as the 'good' ending... and sincetime travel is readily available in order to try and fix mistakes, I can't help but try and save her anyway. I've never wanted to see a character recieve a happy ending more than I do for her. I genuinely feel like this fictional character deserves happiness, and 100% of my effort in order to save her.And the music of this game is pretty great. Every scene has a tune that fits well, and helps with the tone of the setting.

I will be honest, this is the first thing in a long time that has actually made me cry when a character dies. No joke. They are just that well written.Its a sci-fi visual novel with some dating sims stuff in it as you can hang out with the 5 main dragons or 5 secondary dragons. You have to different things to unlock them all and the game also has different endings based on different things. YOUR CHOICES DO ACTUALLY MATTER.Each time you play through the game you will see more and more of your previous choices pop up and see clear changes in the story depending on those choices and which good endings you have gotten. You need them all to get the best ending possible.Your choices will affect alot of things, especially the direction of how the story goes, will you become friends with a dragon? Will you get all the good endings by finding out stuff about each in each playthrough? Or will you just do what you want and get the bad ending? The choice is yours.I cannot wait for more content, fan made on the steam workshop (YES THEY ADDED SUPPORT FOR IT) or canon made by the devs. Maybe we will get a sequel or maybe thanks to the workshop, the devs can keep adding stuff to the game so that we don't need one. Personally I hope we do get a sequal that follows the true and best ending.Keep writing novels, I'll deffo support them and fund em if I can.I recommend this if you like Sci-fi and like dragons and amazingly well written characters.My current game of the year 10/10."
,Recommended,571880,29885317,Posted: 12 February,all,Adine the Banana Wyvern,"Angels with Scaly Wings, it certainly is a hidden gem in the Steam community and it certainly needs more attention.I had no idea what to expect when buying this game. I was honestly just curious to see what the game would bring me. I am not a scalie and nor will I ever want to become one, but I’d definitely recommend this game for people that are not in that weird social group for sure. It’ll have a storyline that’ll grip you in and have you awake all night, telling you to play the game until you’ve found the true ending. It’ll make you cry when a tragic event happens to your favorite character. And speaking of your favorite character, let’s not forget you’ll fall in love will the main cast as well and you’d practically want to be there to see them physically.(This section contains minor spoilers, so hover over the black mass when ready:)The main thing that makes me unhappy about this game, though, is how the true ending went. I with many others felt as if this was rushed. A true/final ending is supposed to ensure satisfaction in that you have finally finished your long and tough journey having to witness the hardships of life and death while even feeling emotions of sadness and hate. Sure, this ending revealed all the secrets we needed, but it didn’t give us insight on what happened to the main dragons next. Let’s not forget that one character that constantly dies in all of their endings. If the game gave us an insight on what their happy future looked like, then we’d definitely be satisfied, but I guess that’ll have to wait in a mod or potential sequel.Alright, now here comes my rants on other reviews. I’ve seen some short reviews of “This game was fun and I loved it.”, but going onto metacritic, there were some pretty bad and misleading reviews from actual critics. Why were they misleading? *sigh* Because this game didn’t have enough “adult content.” This game already DOES have enough adult content, look at the darkness this game give! You certainly wouldn’t find this dark stuff in a T for Teens game. Unless they are complaining about there isn’t enough sexual content in the game, then they shouldn’t be critics at all. If you wanna wank off to a game, just use the tag “Sexual Content” on steam and then find a game to wank to, or just get an account on a rule 34 site and let your inner preschooler out. End of mini and pointless rant.With that being said, this game certainly changed me. Though I’m taking a break from this community for reasons why, I’d certainly recommend others to try this out for themselves. This is certainly a game worth getting into a conversation with friends and family about and telling them how they should try it as well and see what they think.My total score? Who needs one…? Unless you are desperate and seriously want an overall from me, 9.5/10."

,Recommended,571880,35144825,Posted: 22 September,all,NYKevin,"First things first: Angels with Scaly Wings is not a mystery.  If you read its Steam description carefully, you will see that it has not been explicitly advertised as one, but you could be forgiven for having that impression from some of the screenshots and Steam tags.With the most important caveat out of the way, we can get to the actual plot.  Well, plots, really.The main plot of the story is essentially a police procedural (but with dragons).  As with many visual novels, the plot is not gameified; there isn't much in the way of winning or losing here, unless you're playing for achievements.  As a result, this part of the game has almost no replay value.  You're not trying to win anything, so once you have seen the ending, the only part left is to explore the options you missed last time.  You do learn a few new things, and in one or two cases you can get better outcomes.  But there aren't any major reveals because they don't know which options you'll take the first time, and can't risk spoiling the ending.  The good news is that the developers knew this kind of material could be really annoying to click through when replaying, so you don't have to do that.  The game makes it easy to skip through anything you've already seen, without accidentally skipping things you haven't.  As a result, the lack of replay value in this section is unfortunate but does not drag down the rest of the game.As the tag ""Dating Sim"" suggests, the rest of the story is focused on meeting and getting to know a few of the main characters in each playthrough.  Some of these characters have optional romance scenes, but not all of them.  The emphasis is on companionship rather than sex.  Unlike some dating sims, AWSW mostly fades to black rather than showing anything explicit, although there are a couple of suggestive images here and there.The term ""dating sim"" is problematic in its own right.  If you click on the Dating Sim tag, you'll notice that it spans everything from shooters to visual novels, and everything from horror to comedy.  Outside of Steam tags, I have also seen it used to describe ""normal"" games like Mass Effect (actually, I'm pretty sure everything Bioware ever made has been called a ""dating sim"" at some point).  In the case of AWSW, it does have a grain of truth to it, since there are failure states for all of the characters (i.e. you can make them hate you).  In some cases, you can trigger these failures quite easily, with relatively little hinting that you're doing something wrong.  But it doesn't matter, because the game specifically encourages multiple playthroughs.  With the benefit of hindsight (and enough replays), you can befriend anyone.A game like this will largely stand or fall on its characters, especially given that it specifically wants you to make friends with all of them.  Personally, I found them a heartwarming and likable bunch.  You probably won't love every single one of them, of course.  They're a diverse group, and don't always get along with each other.  But they have all been well written, so the average player will take a strong liking to at least one or two of them.Unlike the main plot, the side plots have a great deal of replay value, and not just because you get to meet more characters.  The gameplay has a bit of a Majora's Mask feel to it, in that you're repeating through the same events, never able to help everyone in the same playthrough.  It's a bit depressing at first, but the game finds ways to improve on this formula.The true ending is reasonably satisfying.  Most of the bad endings are quite painful to watch, as are some of the ""good"" endings.  This is deliberate, of course, and well executed.  The only major problem here is that most of the endings are nearly identical for large portions.  The game's skip functionality works as intended here (except for one brief scene which is ever-so-slightly different in each playthrough but still similar enough to annoy), but it further robs the game of replay value it could have had.Overall, I enjoyed the time I had with this game, but I feel like it squandered some of its potential.  While AWSW certainly has more of a plot than a typical dating sim, it still feels less like a story and more like a vehicle for character development.  If a sequel is made, I hope it goes further, with a less linear plot and greater emphasis on player agency and story-relevant choices."

There's a lot more going on under the hood, with a sci-fi plot woven into a tale full of personal tragedies and very human emotions to endure.That said, the writing is not terrible; it could see more variety and some stronger composition in places, but I don't think it is a detriment to the game's experience as you play. The characters themselves are a delight to talk to and get to know, opening up as friendship blooms. There's a pretty nice musical score, nothing out-of-the-ballpark, but there are some strong mood-setting pieces and atmospheric melodies that compliment the game quite well. Artistically speaking, it's very colorful, vibrant, and I thoroughly enjoyed the expressiveness of the characters and simple art style.There may always be for improvement, but honestly, any shortcomings this game may have did not hamper my enjoyment of the experience and it's absolutely charming characters."

Don't go in with the preconcieved notion that this is a dating sim. It's really not. While yes, you can form very close relationships with most of the characters, this game is a very in-depth visual novel with a multitude of endings, and a very thought-provoking story. My first ending, everyone died. Everyone. No one was spared, and I am still recuperating from that fact.The game has an AMAZING soundtrack, with some pretty good heart-wrenching visuals here and there. While I will honestly say going through the story multiple times was a bit repetitive, the game has a very intuitive mechanic of fast-forwarding, without skipping any NEW dialogue and choices, and when you've done an entire scene before, the game asks if you'd like to skip it entirely.And lastly, I largely appreciate that in playing it a second time through, there were a few hints here and there that some things carried over from the previous ending. Such as, the main character remembering a very odd detail here and there, and I'm curious to see if this will be prominent as I get more and more endings. Overall, I'm hugely emotionally invested, and there's no turning back."
,Recommended,571880,30151726,Posted: 24 February,all,Sandalwood,"'Dragonronpa'.  That's the idea that popped into my mind when I first watched the trailer--Danganronpa, but with dragons.  And while some people may see 'Dating Sim' in the tags and write off Angels With Scaly Wings as just that, Danganronpa incorporates that aspect of its game about as much, and yet I don't see a 'Dating Sim' tag on that title at the time of writing this review.  I want to draw a parallel between both of these stories, though.Both games use mystery to drive the plot and encourage you to explore the characters around you, but where Danganronpa focuses on a battle of hope and despair caked in psychological horror to motivate the player, Angels WIth Scaly Wings does this through compassion and curiosity alone.To avoid spoiling anything, I'll simply say this:  I have not shed this many tears over a story since Undertale and I expect to shed many more, both joyful and sorrowful.  Whatever you may think this game is at first glance, it's actually much more powerful than that, and it will find ways to surprise you.  Do yourself a favour and play through blindly--avoid walkthroughs--and keep something on hand to dry your eyes."

I don't want to spoil too much but this is the most intriguing visual novel I have played yet and there seems to be a ton of secrets. I see myself spending quite a bit more time with this one.""The definitive Corydonn Review~The ""You should buy this game"" PitchI really -really- recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of dragons, visual novels or even just are a fan of games that remember your actions and give you tough consequences to chew on mentally. I bought this for the novelty of dating dragons but I found this game had so much more and few games, Heck even few mediums of fiction rival Angels with Scaly Wings in the emotion giving department. It's hard even to put into words dangit.Gameplay -This is surprisingly good for a visual novel and felt more like a puzzle game rather than just a visual novel you replay randomly selecting different choices to see the outcomes. There are multiple clues to each path if you pay attention and you are given a few tips early on through achievements and the starting sections that sometimes doing the same command can yield different results. I had no trouble going through the game and achieving all I wanted to achieve in the story. I did have an issue where I was missing an item I thought I grabbed long ago but that was of my own fault loading a saved game before I actually saved having the item in hand. A handy status screen was able to point out what I was missing near the end so I could figure out myself on what I forgot to get.Story/Writing -Definitely the meat and stength of the game. You start out as an ambassador from a world of humans to a world full of dragons. You have five main characters and five minor characters to choose from and multiple playthroughs to do them in. If you can emphasize or sympathize with any of the characters in the game, You are going to have a great time if not one wrought with ""feels"" and deep thought over the actions you take and the events that occur.Another quick point I want to highlight in the writing of the game is that the game has a few characters that highlight a great introduction to many scientific concepts and beginners psychology. If you find yourself liking these characters I would highly recommend doing more research on these topics yourself. The game isn't too pushy about the subjects but does give you geniune interest in some of these very fascinating topics that I think more people should get into.Sound/Music -It's hard to judge the music in a visual novel because unlike a more action based game you really can't put the music to a specific battle or moment. The music was nice and atmospheric but not too memoriable in that if you gave me all the themes I doubt I could match them to the scene or character. There were also a few issues when using the skip commands to fast forward where the music and sounds would become a bit interlaced but moving onto the next chapter or section would have the reoccuring sounds vanish and the game would play normally.The Bottom Line-I really think this game has a good shot at being my Game of the Year for 2017 for PC even though it lacks multiplayer, a competitive aspect, or much action at all. Angels with Scaly Wings just has pure -soul- put into the production."
,Recommended,571880,29911960,Posted: 13 February,all,Codelizard,"I just finished my first playthrough and am eager to start another.Angels with Scaly Wings is a visual novel oriented towards replaying it to see what other paths you can take, even facilitating it by allowing auto-skipping of previously seen dialogue by holding Ctrl. The characters are varied and interesting. The presentation is minimalist but does what it needs to do very well. It presents a mystery, exposes bits of the story to you at a good pace and intermingles it with character development. The character personalities are well done, as they don't fixate on a single thing and all have their own mix of interests.I don't usually go for visual novels, but this is a particularly well-executed one, I feel.

Spoiler incomingI'm at the part where I've just gotten past the first investigation of the death of a dragon, and I chose to talk to Lorem in the bar about humans and what not.I haven't encountered any cons in the game yet as I'm still in Chapter 1 but I am sure to update this if I find any.Right now I got to say this is a great game so far, it's totally worth picking it up during the Steam Summer Sale.Update!So now I have just finished the game. Spoilers ahead!I of course in my first playthrough of this magnificent game got a neutral ending. How I was going to be sent back but then the portal was mysteriously broken. Stayed for some more, talked to Remy and helped him organize his books aswell as break a priceless artifact (sorry!) and break his game on the computer (sorry again!). Talked with Lorem about his game he was making along with his room mate (real nice fellow).Then I set off to talk to Adine, played some sort of game from a magazine, of course I had fun doing it. She's real nice, I like her. I wish I could have talked to her more before the end. Lastly I talked to Bryce. Talking to him about Reza at the bar, he's a real nice dragon and honstly was fun to hang with. Had a nice drinking contest which ended with him winning and me passed out on the ground.And last but not least it was Chapter 5, the end. The fireworks show was beginning, making my way to the portal I found Sebastian dead (NO! One of my favorites and Reza killed him!) and hopped down into the lab underground where I finally met Reza, that smug a-hole. Some talk ended with the place destroyed, humanity doomed as well as the dragons. Found out that the dragons were a civilization that The Administrator somewhat created on Earth and a comet wiped them out and that the future civilization. 20XX was nearly wiped out by a solar flare.Enough talk about the game aside, all in all this was a damn good game. I mean I really enjoyed it. I liked the art style, I liked how you could be a complete d1ck in this game, which I chose not to, I'm a friendly guy. I especially liked the different responses you could give, I laughed at a lot of them (not that they were stupid, just laughable).The con is that the game is short, but I think the con solves itself with the different endings it has and the replayability, so I guess no cons.

This is easily one of the most complex and compelling storylines to any game that I have played before. Despite being a scaly and having a thing for dragons I can easily put that down and let alone say the dragon romance aspect wasn't even needed at all given the dedication put behind this. But I'll leave it as a bonus.Essentially upon buying this game I had a feeling it was going to be rather generic and just wanted to give it a shot. And well, I was in for a real surprise. There are many endings... 14 I believe. It has a true butterfly effect component that any game even AAA titles couldn't give. I feel it's a shame this game hasn't gotten more attention and praise. You will need to play this... a lot. Over and over but you'll feel compelled to given you crave a final solution; let alone a good one. There is a lot of scientific dialogue that maaay throw some people off who aren't great with understanding it; but even the average Joe will understand a good portion of it.Speaking of science; there are some potholes in the plot but given how complex this storyline is it's impossible to make it absolutely perfect. Let alone much of the ""potholes"" people point out will be explained in the true conclusion. Otherwise this was carefully thought out and carefully put together with such a delicate and complex main topic I won't spoil. All I can say is this is so worth the purchase.Tl;drPros:-very powerful and well thought out storyline-great characters and emotional connection (definitely can be non-romantic)-a massive plot puzzle you believe you've got down that will only stump you later (which will be explained in the end)-amazing art and soundtrackOKs:-dragon romance, it isn't forced but could have been excluded for those not into this stuffCons:-some scenes can drag on a liiiittllee too long but luckily you will later have a skip and fast forward option given when you have to face them again.Overall, please do buy! Definitely on my favorite games list!"

I spent 7 hours straight playing it, and I do not regret a single second of playing this. I will say though beforehand this is a semi-biased opinion since I happen to absolutely love dragons, but this game deserves a lot. The story is definitely an emotion ride, and that is not a bad thing. The characters are easy to care about and the story changes a lot based on choices you have made, which is definitely an impressive feat for a game that got funding from a site. To my own knowledge, after playing through the many replays I have done to see and do everything, I will say there hasn't been any sort of plot hole, everything is explained and has reason, and everything is touched on.The characters, oh boy the characters. This game has wonderfully written characters that have plenty of story to most. (as a side note, I do wish the side characters did have a little more to them, maybe not to an extent of main character but some sidestory would've been nice). I will say this, I enjoyed all of them, and almost every interaction with them. The characters pull you into it, and they certainly won't pull out."

I expected a medicore story that was light-hearted. Basically I just came for the dragons.Instead, I got a dark and grim story with twists and death and pain, in addition to allowing me to date said dragons.Okay now for some actual proper review stuff:The story: It was, as mentioned earlier, was of unexpectidly nice quality. The characters were better written than I expected, with deeper pains I never saw coming (Though, that may just be my inexperience with character focused games) I found it as a decent balance between several moments of calm mixed with darker tones of loss, pain, and murder.The music: I'll be honest, this soundtrack didn't really stick out as anything special, just something to get the job done and set the mood for the scenes.The gameplay: Well, it's a dating sim. There isn't much gameplay to speak of, besides saying that all the branching paths work like they should, and your choices are remembered and can affect the personal stories of the main dragons as you learn more about their pasts and involvements with one another.Overall I've had a fun time with this game as I played through the different paths to try to get to the best ending."

,Recommended,571880,29683576,Posted: 3 February,all,Chriscosmo12,"I know people are going to criticize me for writing a review about a ""Dragon Dating Simulator"", but I didnt feel as if it was a real ""Dating"" thing. I even feel as if I risk something by having my friends see this, but honestly I don't care. This game has had an impact on me.When I first got told about this game from a friend of mine last night, I was already interested since it involved dragons and the reviews were all positive. Something about the game initially felt as if it was going to be a waste of money... although I see now that it definitely was not. After playing through around 3/4 of a single run I decided to go ahead and stop playing for the night. I sat in the main menu for a second, listening to the music, realizing how much significance the backround for said main menu meant for the storyline. I felt like I was doing something wrong in stopping the game at that moment and even thought ""Man, how much I would give to see a real dragon like the ones in this game"". So I played for another 30 minutes before eventually falling asleep.Today I managed to finish the ending ""Adine's bad ending"" and boy, it really WAS a bad ending. It left me completely shocked aseveryone that I had gotten to know had died right there in front of me. All carried out in detailed images of my favorite mythical beings shot to death.Believe me, the developers (Or developer) have done an amazing job planning out the many plot lines, personalities, artwork and when to use the right music. You get so attatched to the characters that when something bad does happen, it hurts you as well. The way the game responds to previous decisions also works really well, the humor is enjoyable at times too. The ""status"" tab in the menu proves to be very helpful if you want to see how your relations are with others. At this moment, I have finished 2 runs and I can easily say that this game is one of my favorite games I have ever played.Sure, it might have some assets where you can 'date the dragons' as the devs say, but I think that is just how you get to know the characters better. All in all, I have enjoyed this game and plan to finish all of the endings. I feel like the developers have made a game about these creatures that I have come to love. Dragons have been a thing I have been interested in for nearly a year now, and it is good to finally see a game that provides such an amazing storyline centered around them. I hope this convinces some people to buy this game, even if you feel skeptical like I was.EDIT: Bryce is certainly my favorite of all the characters. Or maybe its Maverick.EDIT #2: (Contains spoilers about Maverick, don't say I didnt warn you)Maverick is an interesing character and seems to have gone through a lot of trauma especially after having to kill his brother due to a degenerative disease that he had.. It was quite sad to see this scene play out on its own. The other problem is that there is no real way to befriend Maverick to help him through what he went through happened. He just stays being cruel to everyone along with not trusting the humans. In one of the chapters in the beginning, it reveals the ""hint card"" of Maverick lying down on the ground with the word ""Loss"" under it, reminding me of him loosing someone he loved to something he couldnt possibly control. The last thing is that in end of every path, he either dies horribly with two *detailed* shots into his head or he ends up threatening to kill the main character because you did something that is extremely bad for him (causing Bryce's death) or you end up shooting him yourself for attacking The Administrator (probably the worst of them all for me).This essentially means that Maverick dies living a cruel life of killing his own brother at a young age, losing the trust of Bryce who is one of his best friends, never really getting to prove to everyone that he was right about the humans (except the part where you shoot him) and ending up losing his girlfriend because his job was taking up most of his time.Sorry for those of you who are annoyed by a big wall of black text, but this is literally killing me as I cant sleep without thinking about the game. I just wish there was a way to get Maverick to trust you, and help him along through his suffering. Hopefully the devs read this and think about adding some DLC to the game that adds more content, because as of now I feel like I cant do anything. This game is amazing, though I feel as if people would be pushed away from it by being called a ""Dating Sim""."

This isn't your typical animu♥♥♥♥♥♥in-your-face Visual Novel. You can date the dragons, yes but it also has substance to it. There's a plot and a rollercoaster of emotions in store. Sure there's a few over of used tropes but over all it's pretty solid. I think that if you're looking at reviews for a dragon dating sim murder mystery visual novel you're probably going to like it. It has a lot of replayability (though it's required for the full story/ good endings) and I'd say 10 dollars is worth it, but if you'd rather wait for a sale then by all means. Be warned, it's got quite a bit of reading involved."

It's a relatively unique concept, the story is unique point-blank, and it's all executed well. It's true, that as a person with a dragon for a profile icon that I'm biased, but if I encountered a stranger on the street, and somehow magically knew that said stranger would consider buying a visual novel/dating sim, I would recommend this game even if their full name was Human-Muggle McNotascaly.The Good:The characters are all great and I adore each and every one of them, even the ones I hate, with the possible exception of Reza. He could have done with more characterisation (we see him one time in the beginning and one time in the end despite his critical importance)The story follows in the best traditions of soft Sci-Fi. The world they've built is incredibly interesting and I can't help but entertain about 20 'what if?' stories surrounding it. I really, really hope the creators build off of it in future projects. That said, it's about as soft as sci-fi comes, so be sure to check any education in physics or cosmology at the door.Criticism:I would have liked a few more scenes with characters. Two more would be fine. As it stands, the time budget is a bit too strict and you can't really explore your options beyond a love interest and a friend-friend (of course, it has multiple endings so multiple playthroughs are expected)The pacing of the story could be a bit more even. You seem to spend a large part of the game in a holding pattern as far as the plot is concerned. This may just be a quirk of the genreCertain situations could do with some more dialogue options. Specifically, the game generally lets you choose to either come on to characters strong, be friendly but somewhat reserved, or just be outlandish; I often found myself wanting for a more subtle 'wait for their cue' option."

I was very suprised that it actually felt like a good game. I had to tell people how it isnt something weird and its actually a good game when people asked me about it XD. Sure, there are some parts (if you have finished the game you know what i mean) that have to happen in order to get all the good endings but all in all it is a solid game. The story is very interesting and really gives you that ah-hah moment when you put it all together. I know its not a game for anyone but with a little bit of open-mindedness and it would be worth the time and money."

This is simply my experiance of the game.This game is in need of a completely new story. It was alright to play though the first time, but after that the game was just tedious. I truly liked the origninal idea behind the story, but I don't think it would be something that I would like to see a sequel of. I liked the original artwork of the game and enjoyed the charectors quite a bit. However, I was quite astonished to find how quickly the relationships, ah, escolated. I honestly did not think things would, um, go down that road. I do think that the game is priced right. In my book 1 hour of game play is a dollar of entertainment so if I spend $50 on a game I would expect to at least get 50 hours worth of gameplay. Which is to say, I clocked about 9 hrs total in the game and paid about $9 dollars.With all of that being said, I would say that this game is worth a try if you are looking for something different to do. However, I do not see myself contiuing to play more of this game as after you complete the story the first time, the game is quite tedious."

(This is still early in it's release and might still change slightly to fix some lingering issues if the ability to do so is there)  Even with some inconsistancies and a little jarring with the change in art style when a dragon is introduced as compared to when you are talking with them. I feel strongly that I will likely play this over again multiple times to try to clear the rest of the achievments and to enjoy the Visual Novel again. This made me laugh, cry, become shocked, cringe, and so many more various emotions the deeper I got into it. Not to mention how fustrated I got at times with Resa. Learning about the characters and comparing my first impressions verses how knowing so much more about them had changed my opinions of some of the characters.I would love to see another Visual Novel made by the same team. I can only speculate on how one could continue this Visual Novel with a sequel that is within reason, but a compleetly new story would likely be amazing if I had to guess.Play this Visual Novel if you like to have all the Feels, like Worm Hole travel, and/or Sentient Dragons!"

I'd been following this game for a very, very long time, possibly two or three years. And I cannot say that I am disappointed.I was never one for visual novels. As much as I loved books, they just never got to me.But this game appealed to me on all levels.I am a dragon adorer. I'm fascinated by mythology. I may even go as far as to admit that I believe in dragons. In fact, this game is EXACTLY the ""truth"" I believe in. I won't spoil it.I was so happy to pick this up on launch. I'd been dying to try it.I've barely gotten anywhere and I've found myself deeply enjoying the story. It is very unique, and has multiple endings by the looks of it, maybe thousands. I haven't ventured deep into the game as of the time of writing.I quickly met a few characters and began to understand who they are and what they do. They're all unique and also are quite pretty I will admit. I was told by a friend that Iwillfall in love with a character.He wasn't wrong.I found a character who I felt deeply related to. He's quiet, doesn't have many friends, supposedly doesn't have a family, he's shy, he loves mythology, and he loves video games and aspires to make one. He's literally a dragon version of me! I felt attached almost instantly. I had to get to know him more.I progressed to try and understand him to see if my first thoughts were correct. And they were. I feel inticed to discover more about him --- and every other character in this game.But I can't bring myself to be mean to people, as that's a given option to do so.In this game you can really be yourself. Usually you don't get many choices but I felt like they would pretty much be the generic choices of a person anyway, not something absurd.I can't wait to delve into this game more and uncover every last word of its multiple storylines.For now, I will happily give this game a 9/10 purely for its depth and story, as well as character design. I will update this review as I continue, so stay tuned.EDIT:  progressed through the game entirely and achieved the ending. I will not spoil anything.This game had me in tears."

Because dagnabbit, this game broke my heart, that's why.Pros:-Can date dragons (I mean it kinda was the point right)-Sci-fi plot does indeed exist-character art and such is decent-Minigames really added to the game experience and enjoyment by having things to do and interact with other than just picking my option. Even a couple simple puzzles, good stuff.Cons:-what even is this protagonist? to avoid spoilers I won't go into too much detail, but I really don't think a plot twist for the player should be reserved to about midgame (on first playthrough) to reveal your OWN backstory. There are clever hints and foreshadowing to stuff you should already know in character, but...none of that is self-evident the first time through.-sitting through 5+ versions of the end credits while the music plays (or more if you're trying for all the endings) is super frustrating, and yet necessary to continue advancing the story.

The clues are slowly building up together, getting really close to find the solution out of this whole mystery. Also, Kevin is such a geek <3[...] Finally, after 16 hours, the true ending.This game plays like a very good book, you always want to go forward, understand moreof the plot, get to know the characters. They are all unique and interesting.Everytime I though I was done and found everything, the game surprised me with new events, new little things. The hints about the story are clever, and I rarely felt uncomfortable because of a weird chain of events.

,Recommended,571880,30696465,Posted: 23 March,all,Korvia,"First I must say at the beginning going through it blind, it was quite an experience of unsure what to expect! The possibilities I thought were quite open and the story had a good plot to it though it seemed a bit.. missing pieces. I won't be giving any spoilers but I will say there are several playthroughs needed to unlock the 'final' piece of the puzzle for the ending of this game and it does get faster when you see some similiar scenes and remember choices.Overall, the music, the art and the story is what caught my attention. The aspect of 'dating' isn't as literal as people may take it, sure there are qualities of it, getting to go out and know and even fall in love and feelings for characters HOWEVER in my personal opinion? That didn't seem like the main focus point of the game for its story. Yes, it plays a vital role to get to KNOW them and help them on a personal level with their hopes and dreams and intentions, and maybe even change fates for them, however to officially romance long-term with any one in specific I don't feel is the highlight here.  It's all pieces of a puzzle and it does take some thinking and time building trust, friendship and just being there for those you love or would call a friend truly.This is what has touched me most espcially coming to the conclusion of the game, sitting at 98% achievements (I think the one is bugged at my attempts) I have pretty much cleared it all, and would HIGHLY recommend it to those who'd like to delve into a rather well thought out story.The only seeming long part that may or may not be an issue for anyone, is that one does have to practically do everything to accomplish and the dialogues are different to where you cannot 'skip' unread dialogue however you can use that for future assistance if needing to repeat a scene or quick through it and just make choices selectively.Getting to know the characters has touched my heart, and I truly hope there is a sequel as from what I grasp, there is much potential for such! Only by completing it fully will it all make sense and even then, it leaves it open to potential continuation or up to imagination."

If you really likedragonsa lot, FOR THE LOVE OF WHICHEVER GOD(S) YOU BELEIVE IN, DON'T GET THIS! Why? Simple: FEELS. No, really.This game starts out simple, happy and awesome; I mean, come on you get to talk with FRICKING DRAGONS, what could be better!? But then you get to your first ending and... OH GOD, I DID NOT SIGN UP FOR THESE EMOTIONS.There's no way of explaining it besides this: the game lets you choose a dragon companion, fills your heart with happiness and joy - woo, dragon friend, awesome! It then proceeds to tear your heart out of your chest, smash it into a million pieces in front of you and force you to collect those broken pieces and put them back together just so it can smash apart your heart again and again, each time killing you more and more inside.I was stupid enough to play through the entire thing in 2 days (offline, so ignore the glitched time spent playing it; Volvo, plz) and I'm not afraid to admit that on more than a few occassions I may have shed more than a few manly tears and left with a feeling of terrible hollowness, dread and sadness.And yet still, I would recommend this because it's an experience.

If you try to romance someone but haven't figured out some crucial backstory and puzzle to their character, you get some tragic ending which motivates you to figure the game out to get that happy ending.Repeat this core gameplay loop where you unravel the main story and all its mysteries relationship by relationship and you get to the meat of this game. Then I hear there's a super good ending where you puzzle out the *real* motivations of the main villain or something.The themes they touch on are also super mature, ranging from cancer, to orphans, to a loved one's death etc. Dang.Angels in Scaled Wings definitely does seem so far to be much more than what one might think from the cover. I also really appreciate that the romances are optional, so you don't even have to get into that to experience the game.Not only that, but if you manage to puzzle out do all 5 'good' endings you get a True Ending that will hit you right in the gut if your feels weren't already all drained from all the other bad endings you get. Even the 'good' endings made me cry.It has a few flaws, such as being very dependant in boring-as-hell expository segments, and could use another run of spellchecking and proofreading. After 20 hours of playtime I still do not get some of the meta explanations which infringes on spoiler territory but if you're willing to look past that you will experience a very great game.The game receives an incredible recommendation from me and most definitely should be tried out at its low price.TL;DR Incredibly engaging story, fleshed out memorable characters, interesting meta narrative that lasts though your multiple playthroughs."

Sure, maybe the writing is not always up to its full potential (e.g. overexplanation), but that I can easily overlooked here.I found some topics raised to be bold in a positive way and while this is not a pornographic game - really, NSFW content would take away from it - the creators manage to get the right amount of innuendo, grown up humor and difficult topics in there to make it a well rounded experience.The settings, the artwork, music, details about how the different species cope with their strengths and weaknesses in daily life, show me that the makers of this game gave a lot of thought to it.Ultimately a game like this lives and dies with the characters, though (pun intended) and wether or not I can empathize with them. I can only speak for myself here of course, but I will say this: I could easily empathize with them and I want them to survive and be happy. In fact I have to admit that at one point I wanted the good ending of one character so badly, that I looked up the steps in a guide here and discovered that this character’s plotline can go a third way and I know I will never have the heart to chose this third route for him.I like how all of them have a reason to be the way they are and that these backstories can be found. It is these interwoven fates together with a lingering threat that makes it a thrilling and captivating experience.The technical realization seems spotless to me. The game allows to easily skip over passages of text and scenes that have already been seen, allowing for rapid repeated playthroughs. Autosaving works great and I did not encounter a single bug yet. In general the makeup of the game is very fitting and sympathetic (UI, sounds etc.).Needless to say that a game like this is not for everyone, but I am not even half through and got more than my money’s worth out of it. Surely it helps a lot when you like dragons, I mean, what other audience does it aim at?I already gifted the game to some friends and bought the deluxe edition upgrade, because it well deserves supportingThe game raises the right topics and sent me on an emotional roller coaster more than once. After all it does not go easy on the player. Well done and thank you for that."

I didn't think much at the time, and then I was surprised when a copy was bought for me.I went in totally expecting semi-pornographic bait. Dragon lover/furry fan-service. But oh no, I was blown away. I shouldn't have been so cynical.I don't play many visual novel games, so I certainly can't say I have refined taste. But the story was much, much more than I anticipated, and I was left surprised right until my last moments playing. There's plenty to do and plenty to unlock, but not an absurd amount. I got a solid 20 hours of genuine entertainment out of what I expected to be 1 hour of cheap laughs at best.You don't even have to be a fan of dragons to enjoy this. The artwork was fantastic and colorful, the story was interesting, and it's very clear the devs and artists put their love and care into this. I am really, really looking forward to any updates or future content from them.And for a $10 price tag (though I'd recommend the special addition to get that soundtrack/additional art), it's more than worth it."

,Recommended,571880,29902610,Posted: 13 February,all,Nubnubbud,"NO SPOILERS HERE! Come in, read a bit.Alright, this game is one of the few that I'll actually review. This game is HUGE (in length and scope), so I'll only break down where it stands in relation to most modern games, and suggest this to anyone who is tired of games that pander to you, and try to be what you want. This game doesn't care what you want, and it'll make you love it for what it is.The short and sweet:This game breaks down what human society is, with a focus on intimacy. Intimacy is an integral part of any society, and AWSW, beyond anything, nails that. As well, for any lover of sci-fi, Isaac Asimov himself might as well have drafted the technical details. You can eat your heart out, Mass Effect.The not so short and barely sweet:AWSW approaches science fiction and character relations in a way no AAA game would dare, or really has. There is no magic here, and if you see a plot hole, chances are you're not reading the text. There are also adult themes, but nothing explicit. The character are who they are, not token insert personalities, and no dumb excuses are made for characters who do conform to stereotypes. The characters don't need a reason to be a certain way. some do, some don't. And boy, when I say maturity, do I mean it. This game just barely escaped Mature ratings by being indie, but it's not about mature stuff. Intimacy is an integral part of any society, and this game nails that. Once again, eat your heart out, Mass Effect.STORY:OH MAN.if this is what you want in a game, play this game. no spoilers here, except that it's a sci-fi, and approaches the entire topic with a thouroughness only expected of Isaac Asimov himself. Bravo. This is the only area where the game truly shines.The characters can be a little bland or stereotypical, but beyond that, they each have their own charm, and a personality that feels substantive. They make decisions, and rope you along, and some aren't afraid to be a little rough on you, emotionally. There are a couple quick inserts from high sponsors, but that's a given, This game needed to roll in something just to release at this quality. With more funding, their stories may be expanded.ART:with the exception of a few assets, the art here is fantastic. Most visual novels use blurred out photos, but for the most part, the backgrounds here are handmade in a variety of ways. It was clear, though, that if it had gotten maybe five times the funding(the entire thing was made with under 12k to fund two years of development), Full animations may have mde it into the game.Music is a bit odd at times, but truly fits the themes, I would have liked a bit more variety, Though, too much would be a bit overboard-calm is good here.Sound assets are absolutely fantastic. As a sound designer, I would love to know how they were obtained. They're used very well to puntuate the story, without being obtrusive. I wish some more were used for ambience however."

76561198036561843,Recommended,571880,29947142,Posted: 15 February,all,Owlflame,"So let's get the pros and cons out of the way.Pros:-characters progress in really interesting ways. If you have a dragon you like and you get to the parts where you learn more about them, you do actually gain a lot of insight into how they became the kind of person they are today and why they'd be so suddenly desperate to want to be a part of your life. A lot of them are really human, like Bryle and... um... Adile I guess. Which was kinda nice because from that point it was one of those stories that just felt like a people story but replace people with dragons.-the art is pretty alright (for the most part.) while it's true that the art has a tendancy of being inconsistent, I attribute that more to laziness on  those few moments rather than the game as a whole. Drawings of characters, backgrounds, and those really uncomfortable sexy pans all look nice and I never felt any ire toward them.-The story was weirdly consistent. Spoiler alert: If you wind up getting to the part where you learn you're in a time loop, you may notice that each character's ending contributes to the story differently. New events may happen and entirely different people may die or live causing your character to have to take different actions when returning to the previous timelines. Those even present themselves in other endings (not in order, but that's not a bad thing.) and you can piece together when things happened. That's a neat touch.-I like the ability to skip through scenes you've already done in subsequent playthroughs. Really saves time because the game is actually surprisingly long for the genre.- the game is really fun to achievment hunt through. There are a lot of achievments and side things to do. It's a nice touch- Spoiler alert: You can get remmy to kill himself. That's pretty cool. ♥♥♥♥ that guy.Cons:-On your first playthrough when you're trying to learn about the world, you run into a moment that shakes everything you've been thinking that whole time without even meaning to. Spoiler alert: until around the chapter 3 arc, you assume you're just some guy from earth. Probably our earth. Your buddy dresses like a normal dude, and you're just some guy. It turns out that your planet was struck with solar radiation equal to the equivilant of 1.3 billion hiroshima bombs and pretty much destroyed humanity when it was at it's most vulnerable. I'm gonna ignore forever that 1.3 billion hiroshima bombs would wipe out the earth (just 1 almost wiped out a population.) and instead get to the fact that you had no reason to believe you came from an apocolypse. It is straight up explained to you that you come from a mad max world and all semblence of reason and logic have flown out the window as everyone is scrambling to fill unnamed and made up power vacuums. (not the story making them up, society is. Which is fine.) So then why are you a normal dude, and your partner is also basically a normal dude? Sure, he goes on a murder rampage, but who wouldn't? The problem is, he didn't seem like the kind of guy who would.-Some of the art is really bad. Characters like Lorem and the college guy suddenly have really gross, heavy outlines around them that clearly seperates them from the more restrained rest of the cast. That includes Sebastion who stands right next to Lorem in Lorem's first scene.- There are two really weird moments when your character is uncharictaristically rude to people. The first being when you meet the college guy, and the second being your fourth scene with Lorem when he offers to buy you pizza.- the ""friendship"" meter or whatever in the status bar should probably be represented outside of checking the status bar. Mostly because of trying to get the good ending for characters like Anna.- I'm not a fan of the fact that if your relationship with anyone turns ""bad"" for any reason, you can never talk to them again. You can't even try to bring it back to neutral. Which is a shame, how you can sway a character to be your friend again after they decide they don't like you is often a great way to learn more about what kind of person they are. I'm not saying every character needs it, but Bryle certainly does, and so does Remmy. Probably Anna as well. Actually, absolutely Anna.- there's a very uninteresting plot dump with a character in a mask at some point, and to really give you a feel for how long it is, I want you to grab a stop watch and get to that scene on your second playthrough. Don't skip the scene itself, but after you're asked to skip the scene, hit the fast forward button where it just shoots through the scene as fast as it can. You'll be amazed at not only how long that scene is, but also how few times anything visually changes. That's a good half hour on your first run at least.- I think Maverick could have used more flushing out. I found his character the most interesting but you only learn about him in snippets. He has the most to lose and the most investment in what's going on. Hell, you even go to a barbeque with him like nothing's wrong and I just want to know what he's thinking.- For some reason, only in interactions with Remmy, you can continually solicit him for sex. You're never given that option for any other character, so I'm made to believe it's cannon that your character is most sexually attracted to Remy. I wouldn't even have a problem with that if there weren't only two characters you could have sex with, spoiler alert, and remmy isn't even one of them.- I think Lorem's story and progression in general are very weak and poorly handled. Which is a shame because I liked his character in meetings 1 and 2. He came off as someone who had goals and was new to exploring them. Then in 3 it's like ""let's have a treasure hunt."" and you do and learn nothing about Lorem in it. In 4 he comes to you with an existential crisis that sounds completely out of nowhere, then you solve it, then he comes at you with a second existential crisis that also comes out of nowhere and you resolve that too.-Lorem's good ending is incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to stumble upon.Conclusion.I'm only clicking ""not reccomended"" because I genuinely wouldn't reccomend this game to anyone but people who think the pros are ok. I had fun with it, I'm sure you'll maybe have fun with it. The main cast are all so interesting and varied in their own ways you'll find someone you like... but that's about it. Play it if it's your kind of game. Don't if it's not."

The best option is to do it yourself!!!Another big part of is the characters and the possible endings you can have with them. You can easily fall in love with every single one for their personalities are very unique.(Me personally I fell in love with that beautiful charcter Lorem) At one point I had accepted he was my baby, I loved him so much!!!If I had to say one thing that disappointed me was the fact you couldn't keep living with them after the ending but my time with the characters was amazing none-the-less.But hey I'm just some random reviewer, try it for yourself and see what you think.

It takes an hour or so to get going, and a couple of sequences are a little clunky, but overall it reads pretty well and once it has your attention you'll want to see it through more than once.  It's worth it's asking price.The plot is interesting, and the central narrative is cleverly layered.  The characters are a varied bunch which is always good in a VN.  Also the story can get pretty grim at times - fair wanring has been given.If you're concerned about the dragon dating aspect I shouldn't worry too much.  There are a couple of romance elements, but it's predominantly a character-driven story, and having non-human characters is a fundamental aspect of the plot as opposed to a superficial thing.If you're reading this you're probably already interested, so if you haven't already bought it you're in for a pleasant surprise."

There is a dark over tone, and some scenes can be sad, and violent, but its' story and well crafted characters shine through."

This game is soooo much more! The whole place lives! And it´s an incredible feeling, to discover this new world with dragons. All the people with it own problems, joys and feelings.Overall the whole place, all dragons that lives there, the interaction they have in this world, works. Not perfectly, I have to say, but it gives a real feeling about this world.I can´t say this game is for everyone, you have to be openminded. But if you do, this game will certainly have an impact on you. For me, it was a remarkable experience.Also I can recomment to play it more then once. Everytime I found more places and dragons with it own storys.Edit 06.08.2017Since I recommended the game, I couldn´t stop thinking about it and playing. There was so much more to discover. And I´m so happy about this game. It´s outstanding! It´s catapulted to my top favorite games! Really the best thing that could happen to me. Even though, it was a rollercoaster of emotions and othen hard to stand, in the end, it´s just makes me incredibly happy. I´m so happy came across this game.The more amazing thing is, it changed a lot of things. I love this society, I feel so happy in it. I know, it´s not perfect, you clearly see some problems in this world, too. Anyway I want to say, some people could learn from it. For example the incredible tolerance, that´s also necessary, when you think about the many different species, that life together. Things like that changed my point of view in some issues. I have more hope in things and be more positive about it.It´s incredible what a single game could do. For me it´s perfect. Thanks for doing this game, it gives me so much. It´s truly an outstanding game and I love it :-)"

""I rarely play  visual novels AWSW may have gotten me into playing  visual novels.more  your actions effect the story and it has cute and loveable dragons. You really get attached to the characters"" lorem needs more love though"
,Recommended,571880,33967487,Posted: 2 August,all,Darkwing,"♥♥♥♥ this game, what an emotional rollercoaster.I've played almost no visual novels before this game, but damn, am I satisfied at the quality of the story-driven nature of this game. A game where the canon story has you play through many, many times (minimum 13 times for all main endings) and it makes sense to do so. Every single question I had in a playthrough was answered in another playthrough or the true ending. I'd strongly compare this game to Kentucky Route Zero in terms of gameplay, as KRZ was just a visual novel with interactive movement elements.Don't be so quick to judge this game as a ""dragon dating sim"". It has elements, but it isn't horrifically in your face about sexing things ala HuniePop or Hatoful Boyfriend. Each character has their own side story arcs, and it isn't really about banging them. I nearly cried when I was told about one character's depressing backstory. Anna's good ending is the most bittersweet story I've heard in my life. The true ending was worth it, and more than satisfying.I'll put it this way. If you have even the slightest interest visual novels, get this damn game."

Well first is that this game is very well written, I enjoyed all of the dialogue and especially the art. All of the endings were interesting and kept me wanting more, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys reading and especially dragons! The reason why I got this game is because it's about dragons and probably the reason why I haven't been able to stop playing! Personally it was an emotional rollercoaster through some of the endings and a little confusing at some times as well but I'd recommend this game to you ESPECIALLY if you love dragons and enjoy reading as well. I don't think I have much more to say other than BUY IT, IT'S SOOO GOOD!? <3"
