,Recommended,572160,31018256,Posted: 8 April,all,R3T.R0,"**Last updated: 12.06.20179/18 not enough holesI recommend the game but I can't recommend buying it as of now.The gameplay mechanics are interesting with the game's physics and controls.However, there are currently only 9 holes to play on.The maximum of 4 player per game is also somewhat annoying since I imagine this game would be a blast if there would be more map variety and maybe 8 (>12 might be a stretch) players per game.EDIT: There was an update increasing the max. amount of players from 4 to 8 so that is great news!It still needs more maps though and a map editor could boost its longevity by a great amount (maybe even a gamemode where players have assets to play on a map and they then play it; kind of like Ultimate Chicken Horse)These missing features are most likely added later on since that's already planned according to the ""What the developers have to say"" part.Reasons to pick it up now:You were a fan of Golf? (Golf Questionmark, which is pretty much this game's predecessor)You want to pick it up for 4,99€ (or whatever your price is in your country) since the price will be increased in the futureReasons to wait:Not enough content as of yet (only 9 holes to play on)*You might need to portforward the port in the option's menu if you want to allow others to join"

Best golf game ever? I wouldn't know, I don't really even like golf but I sure do love this game. There's no better way to spend $5 assuming you have friends that will play this with you. Buy it, now."

,Not Recommended,572160,31004715,Posted: 7 April,all,Pandoomic,"This game didn't seem to work as intended for me at all. In the first server I joined I wasn't able to move. The second server I joined removed parts of the HUD so I couldn't tell what I was doing. The third game finally worked okay.I'd be willing to put up with this much weirdness in an early access title if the gameplay were good, but it's not.The concept behind how the golf swinging works is good. You have a bar that you swing your mouse cursor across in a golf-club-like fashion, which determines how your ball travels. Unfortunately, while looking at this bar the camera is locked on the ground at your feet so you can't really guage anything by sight.All in all I'd give this game a 2/10 for good ideas implemented badly."
,Recommended,572160,31167986,Posted: 15 April,all,mufasajones |6FN|,So much fun so far. I played a round by myself then just spent time doing practice swings.
76561197971480311,Recommended,572160,31889213,Posted: 21 May,all,Johnny7,I played an old version of this game over ten years ago but thought it had disappeared for good several years ago.When I found this on Steam again recently I bought it straight away with no doubts. The game is limited currently but what’s here is even better than I remember and great fun to play.I really hope this game is the success it deserves to be and gets developed to its full potential.
,Recommended,572160,31851163,Posted: 19 May,all,Chaz,"So I saw this was available for a free weekend, and I'd been curious about it for some time. After taking this opportunity to play the game, I bought it in a heartbeat.For all of its bizarre visuals and eerie music (Which I admittedly turned down in favour of playing my own music while golfing, sorry devs!), as well as its silly golf-cart physics and other shenanigans, buried deep beneath all of that is a surprisingly good golf game.In particular, the game's advertisement of having ""A swing mechanic designed to be satisfying"" is actually spot on the mark - For a simple mechanic based on using your mouse to imitate the swing of the club, the game does a really good job of helping you feel the 'weight' of the club, and the guide ruler helps you angle your shot just right. I've had a lot of fantastically satisfying moments where I've chipped a ball into the hole from off the green, and it feels perfect.My only complaint, one that is shared with other players currently, is that there's only one 9-hole course available at the moment, but honestly for the price (55 cents a hole when it's not on sale!) I'd say it's worth it.I have not tried this game multiplayer yet, but I hope to convince a few of my colleagues to join me for a few rounds of ball chess soon."

76561197976599815,Recommended,572160,35233881,Posted: 26 September,all,Bazooka Sven,"Golf for Workgroups is a very fun, unique game that uses simple art to transform the golfing experience in to something extraordinary. Tracking your ball and driving the carts around the courses is particularly fun with friends. Definitely worth the price if you play it a few times. I hope to see this title fully fleshed out."
76561197978445005,Recommended,572160,35233818,Posted: 26 September,all,Sven the Gnome,"I was a huge fan of GolfQuestionmark so I'm glad to see that it finally made its way to steam (under a new name). It's nice to have a full fledged golf game rather than just miniature golf(which is fun too). Plus, why wouldn't you want to drive around in golf carts with rocket sauce?"
,Recommended,572160,35233864,Posted: 26 September,all,BerlinWallNeverFall1991,"Golf for Workgroups is very similar (if not the same game) as Golf? on windows 95ish? Anyway this is a fun golf game that you can play for a while with friends. There is only 9 holes, so there needs to be more, but the driving of carts is a different and fun experience. I do like the obstacles such as the water, the black holes and other things that I have no idea what to call. It seems like the difficulty messes with the gravity and forces you to be perfect with your shots. There is nothing wrong with this game as it runs well when you make your own server. The only negative thing I have to say is there is not enough content to continue to play for hours. I am hoping and fairly sure there will be more holes, content and extra things to be added in the future to make this game even better! However I do have a lot of fun with my friends playing this game a little bit at a time and would suggest to others if you have a few dollars and friends to play with to get this game. This is a fun and different experience than Golf with friends and Golf It."
