It absolutely takes skill - but if you tend to get frustrated when random chance foils your opportunity for success, this isn't the game for you.  Definitely worth it for the price.  I'll keep playing until I finally win, but I sense that it will take a long time.  One way to win the game is to survive through winter, and I've gotten to about 15 days left in winter before dying.  Major accomplishment."
76561198068066750,Recommended,572300,29655876,Posted: 2 February,all,metalpencil,"Fun game!  Definitely took the entire tutorial to get things firmly figured out.  And there is a learning curve, for sure.  My first few games were riddled with big mistakes, which immediately cost me the game.  But, it was fun enough that I wanted to keep at it.  Got really far during my third attempt... but one bad decision ended up snowballing in to another failure.So, there's definitely a challenge, VERY worthy of the $4 price tag... and the game has so many ways that it can eventually expand, that it might be the most inexpensive game that I'll keep coming back to again and again.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~UPDATE (after having played two more games):My opinion has not only remained VERY POSITIVE, but I think I like the game even more now.For the reviews that say ""luck kills you every time!""... No, it doesn't.  The last two times I played, I won both games.  Yes, luck plays a major part in the game... but there are definite ways to enhance how your luck goes.--Make sure you have a fairly even amount of resources on the dice, because you they ALL seem equally important.. so being without one is really bad.--Go on adventures, but always keep rolling back to your home base.  Build up your food supplies and upgrade the hell out of your home base.  Make it so that every time you visit home, you have a steady supply of Food and Survivors to get yourself back to 100%.--Figure out a hierarchy of your crew.  Someone might have to die.  And instead of spreading your injuries around, kill off the least valuable member of your crew and then immediately go home (if  you have an upgrade that brings people in) and replace him/her.--When you do get new Survivors, be smart.  Don't attach yourself to anyone.  Pick the team with the best balance and the least amount of Food dice.  Blanks suck, but blanks don't hurt you like Food hurts you.--And lastly, when all seems lost, it can be easy to lose hope and abandon the game.  But you can still survive.  Food can eventually be replenished.  More Survivors will come immediately.  And, I've found, the more you suffer, the greater it feels when something does fall in your favor.  It actually feels like you're trying to survive.  Low lows but very high highs."

With just about everything resolved with a roll of the dice, and the life of your main character and his companions held in the precarious balance of Lady Luck, it may not be for everybody, but if you like the thrill of casting the dice, then it's worth a looksie.A rogue-like through and through, it offers a good deal of replayability. While I wouldn't give them any awards for music or graphics, I wouldn't say they're bad, either; good enough to get the job done. The resolution mechanics, I feel, are simple enough to understand within a few conflict resolutions, but complex enough to make things interesting and challenging.The writing is good stuff.I'd say, over all, that this game is well worth the price tag, and wouldn't even be opposed to throwing an extra buck or two to the devs for what you can get. I'll be keeping my eyes on the Happy Hobgoblins to see what other gems they produce, because I don't think they're the one and done type."

But it gets better after you play, get XP and you get your bonus.And yeah, it's one of these games where you say ""I'm gonna play just one fast game more"" and you end at 3:42AM playing (again, don't ask).PD: I've finished the game after 7+ hours. 3'5€ and 7h, 50 ♥♥♥♥ for every hour. And I'm going to still playing this game to get the other endings so, yes, buy it."

The player's goal is to  help the city recover from a devastating plague.  He does this by building a base, assembling a team of helpers, gathering survivors (abstracted) and surviving until spring.The skills of the player and his team are represented by eight sided dice each of which has some combination of the four skill attributes, at least one blank side and at least one side that consumes food.  Game tasks and threats are slso combinations of those same attributes so the player's goal is to assemble a team that will best be able to defeat both the know and unknown dangers.I play this mostly on my iPod.  It's a pleasant and sometimes annoying diversion  for those times when you want to let your fore-brain take a well deserved break.  A couple of thumbs up from an aged player"

,Recommended,572300,29800497,Posted: 9 February,all,Alexander,"Nyheim is actually a deck + dice building game which is done very well.1. deck + dice building :if you play boardames with deck-building concept (like dominion) and you know how it works, you definitely wanna give Nyheim a try2. as to the map, there is no much strategy in it. basically you set HQ as middle in the map as possible to make sure you can reach places where crisis are gonna explode. Then pick the path that you dont have too many risks to deal with and you shall be fine lol who knows but if you're good at deck building then you probablly lower the risk in advance.oh and i beat the game once (so far i've only played for 2 times lol) it took me some time(lots of) to get HQ fully upgraded. BTW at the beginning you are gonna let people die in order to get rid of those injurey cards quickly lol"
,Recommended,572300,29657353,Posted: 2 February,all,riotsquad,"Just managed to set up my first HQ and I'm still quite a bit confused about things but it's been getting clearer for each decision and this seems like a whole lot of fun....in a dystopian; ""You're all doomed"" type of fun way....It has me thinking of a combo of This war of mine and Tharsis, the obvious rolling and usage of dice of the latter and the exploration/searching for items that will make you survive. (this may change as the game moves on, but....)This seems like a lot of fun and it seems to have something that Tharsis lacked (as far as keeping me interested) in it's more open board, Tharsis had the ship and that was it, you saw the entire board at the start, this had you move into new territory, it gives you perks with drawbacks and so on...I'll certainly play a lot more of this....maybe I'll realize it is awful 20 hours in....but that'll mean I enjoyed 20 hours of it and that's still great value...."

Provide resource to counter RNG lose during your exploration-Balance drop between 'loot' vs 'risk'.-The game is very transparent about it's roll / risk on the hex / skill / threat in future turns.Overall: Entertaining for 2-3 hours until it start to get repeatitive, especially at the late part of the game."
,Recommended,572300,29751572,Posted: 6 February,all,-- scippie --,"Allright, this game is surprisingly great!Its price may even be too low, although music and maybe graphics are not that great (but who cares about the latter when the gameplay is great)The game is based around luck with dice. You can be against this kind of game, but in this game, I believe it works. I have played 2 games now and I even won the 2nd already. I must have had lots of luck or... In any case, I will certainly play again, I had great fun with this game and I got my money's worth!P.s. I bought this game after seeing that the developers added a release for Linux in less than two weeks after just one person asked for it. These devs are great and should be supported!EDIT: I just wanted to add to this review because after playing another 5 hours, I realise that this game is even better than I initially thought. Some people complain that it is too random. I disagree, I disagree completely.I have had situations in this game where I thought I was doing great. I was getting over confident and went for locations thinking 'I can handle it' without thinking through enough. If I would have inspected the location better before going there, and had looked around the location better to see that there were no escape routes, I wouldn't have taken the chance and would have just taken the disaster which would not have meant end-game. Now, instead, only two turns after my over-confident choice, I was left with my main character with a wound and no more food having no escape route and thus no places to go and rest. I died from starvation.This is very realistic and I don't agree that it is too random. Instead, you must play this game expecting every roll to be bad and anticipating on that. You will get lucky here and there and that's fine, but expect to not be lucky and things go better.In retrospect, this is much like poker. A game where lots of people think that it also has to do with luck. I have seen people have terrible cards during the whole game, knowing when to bluff and knowing when to run immediately, only to end the game with the first lucky draw (getting two aces) on the final turn.EDIT: Beat the game twice now (played 8 times or so), so this game is certainly doable. Play smart. Don't be overconfident and think before you take your risks. Build up your food early so that by the end of the game you have almost inexhaustible food."
76561197996142533,Recommended,572300,29688171,Posted: 4 February,all,xandier,"First off, Nyheim is a good, but slightly difficult to approach game. It's essentially a single player board game and a pretty good one at that. The tutorial introduces you to the basic rules as you come across them and you are likely to lose the first game or two before you are familiar with the ruleset, but it gets easier after that.Nyheim has pretty nice replayability value. There are different ""mutators"" to the ruleset you can unlock after playing a game or few, like starting with 3 people instead of one but having every space occupied by a threath, or having places less likely to contain threaths in exchance for them emptying faster. There are also 3 victory conditions as far as I'm aware that alter somewhat how you try to survive in the game. Lastly the achievements are suprisingly well thought out, introducing some limits to add challenge for yourself.Most of the cons in the game come from it's inspirational roots as a board game. Even if the game does a lot to mitigate the randomness, you might get unlucky with your dice rolls and early game has little options to mitigate that, and if you get the game going well, it can almost end up being too easy as there is a small power creep effect when you get enough people, skills, equipment and headquarters updates,In the end I do highly recommend it, After learning the rules I had a good time and 2 hours went by without me really noticing."

Once you figure out the mechanics, it does get easier but man sometimes a run of bad dice rolls can ruin you haha! It's got a lot to offer, and I'd highly recommend it. It feels like a digital version of Pandemic (board game) without it actually being Pandemic. I like that you face off against all kinds of rats that carry the diseases.I would love to see some more content, but for 3 dollars on sale, you can't complain!!9/10"
,Recommended,572300,30022386,Posted: 18 February,all,DJames,"I quite enjoyed this game. I would recommend it for anyone that's a fan of board games like Tharsis. It was tough at first; but eventually I understood the mechanics and had a blast. Like any dice game, the RNG will sometimes be infuriating; but upon gaining a full understanding of the systems, I really began to ""roll"" with the punches and enjoy myself. Great, casual game overall."
,Recommended,572300,30436120,Posted: 10 March,all,~Drelor~,Love this game. Tharsis feel with the dice roll but way more to do. Great music. Easy on wallet. Worth the spend. A++. Would like to see the locations and speciatlies random and a random map.
,Recommended,572300,29783464,Posted: 8 February,all,Super Shooter,"Good game overall, A bit to easy when you figure it out. only way to make it challenging at that point is to like build HQ in camping grounds, witch is what im going to do now, but after that i think this game has run its course.Did not bother with the modifiers becouse the game was easy enough to start with but i guess you can pick the ones with the biggest drawbacks or just save exp and play them all with drawbacks, probably going to try that.Really like the consept of these games, rats are a bit boring do, mostly becouse they are all the same and the game is going for simple. don't get me wrong, I really like simple, but this was a bit to simple.Games should be EASY TO LEARN, but HARD TO MASTER.this game failed on the last part, mostly becouse i think they prioritised the first part.With all that said, I will keep an eye on these happy goblins."
,Recommended,572300,33474860,Posted: 12 July,all,mounrou,"(Spent most of my time on the Android version instead of this one. Anyhow.)It's an easier version of Elder Sign.When you first dive into it, both are just as hard. Once you get used to it though, you'll find that the food system and the ability to choose from random d8 sets largely eliminated the two most lethal things in the Elder Sign setup. So once you get past midgame, usually in Elder Sign you'll be half dead and probably fully dead soon, but in Nyheim you'd be strolling through the park waiting for it to end. The additions of EXP-based bonuses only makes it even easier, especially the ""more food"" and ""more item"" ones.Still, by itself it is a pretty good boardgame, and the beginning can still kill experienced players every now and then when they misjudged things.Takes a couple hours or so to finish a game, good for every now an then."

For something which is heavily abstracted into dice, cards and symbols, it manages to get across a good atmosphere of desperation and survival. I was pleased to find that there were no zombies (I'm a little bored of zombies). Your enemies are rats, dogs, injury, starvation and winter."

,Not Recommended,572300,33253567,Posted: 4 July,all,Full Frontal  Yeti,"This game is, when stripped down, the equivalent of guessing what number will come up next on the pRNG table that ranges maybe from from 0 to 500,000. With just lots of nice fluff, flavor, and time sink. At least in vegas you get to know the odds. These devs might not have cared enough to have a clue.This game does not see any issues with handing a randomly icon sided pair of eight sided dice to play a game that requires the player to roll an icon, not on either die they were given. As the first thing they needed to do to advance the game.Offering the player to random redo the dice is the lazy fix for that the designers even allowed to happen.The game that ends in just one or two rolls, is craps, slot machines, black jack, etc. Games that are not expected to go on long. I see a game  here that seems to expects to go a bit longer for such long odds."
