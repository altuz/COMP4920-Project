,Recommended,573170,33957655,Posted: 1 August,all,Degran,"As someone who really enjoyed the Witness it's great to see the not only the line-drawing mechanic reinterpreted as a fast-paced dungeon crawler, but to have many of the same revelatory moments occur in a completely different context. It's a perfect median between very contemplative puzzle-games, and action-oriented roguelikes."
,Recommended,573170,34008823,Posted: 3 August,all,"yes, this is tim","A very tight, very demanding puzzle-ish game that uses a simple, easily learnable set of mechanics to force you to make mind-destroyingly difficult decisions; getting near-perfect completions of most of the later floors requires you to think five steps ahead, but you don't have to be anywhere near perfect to progress to the next stage, which is a pretty lovely nugget of design. You gain items and health for doing earlier floors better, so performance on early floors affects your ability on later ones, and even when you can't figure out the perfect solution you're always pressured to do as well as you possibly can.The randomly generated levels will occasionally throw you a floor you can wipe in one try out of instinct, and occasionally something that has you completely stuck, which can be demoralizing near the end of a good run. There's also a timer on each level, which I guess is there to make sure you can't be TOO cautious, but getting wrecked by a ghost when you're 3/4ths of the way through a tricky level can feel frustrating all the same. Despite these gripes, each individual puzzle is still a joy to solve. I don't know if I'll ever be able to 100% this game, but I find that just loading it up and playing a few floors is satisfying even when I don't get very far. I absolutely got the Tetris Effect going the first night I bought this, when I played it for an hour or so before bed."

Fidel also achieves an old school sense of discovery about the way enemies work and little secretes that arent always immediately obvious but feel incredibly rewarding and exciting to discover as you play.Definitely grab this, very well designed game that seems small at first but surprises you as it expands its world  and depth with secrets."

If you like either of those types of games, you're in for a treat. Fidel's design is simple, devious, and very satisfying. The art, sound, and gameplay all form a very coherent package: short and sweet, and ridiculously replayable. You may not understand what you're doing the first 10 to 15 runs, but then the game's design begins to reveal itself. That's when Fidel gets its hooks into you. I might come back to this review. I just urge you to give this a try if it piques your interest."

Classic line drawing mechanic, combined with (mostly) stationary enemies and the ""three-in-a-row"" bonus somehow gave birth to a super compelling experience. A great example of how the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.The enemies are interesting and intuitive; you pick up on their nuances quite naturally without any tiresome hand-holding.I thin it's a game you really have to try for yourself. I watched Northernlion's playthrough on YouTube and wasn't that impressed, but decided to get the game anyway. 15 mins in and I was hooked. Initially I was a little put off by the time pressure, but after awhile I began to appreciate the tension it provided. The game is not about finding the perfect solution(which often gets tedious in my opinion), and the time pressure just encourages you to move things along with a good enough solution.Also, I'm happily exploring secrets.Overall, highly recommended."

I can see the resemblance! Finding the best path is a real joy, especially because you can take back moves after you make them so you're not just staring at a screen trying to solve the puzzle. Instead, Fidel is always adventuring, trying to find the best path, and maybe sometimes barking.Like all great rouge-likes, the real joy comes from understanding all of the interactions in the game. Like when I discovered if I combo three enemies in a row, the red spiders flip over, vulnerable, until another enemy is killed.It's worth the money!"

At it's heart Fidel Dungeon Rescue is a puzzle game, a very good puzzle game, It puts a board in front of you allow you to attack it as you see fit. You are also able to rewind moves as you make them, and you will definitely need to rewind.I have beaten the game multiple times but still feel compelled to play more of it.

It's genuinely impressive that the creators have managed to make this concept into a working game. The complexity required to make a puzzle/rougelike that works and is consistently fresh each run is executed extremely well. The game never feels unfair, every mistake is something you can see in advance.It took me around 8 hours to complete the game in its current state, although I haven't done the extended challenges. There's definitely room for some more mechanics and ideas to be implemented, and I hope the devs are still planning on releasing a bit more content.Overall, it's a fun and short game, that doesn't get boring before you finish it.Also, bark at everything."

The brick-wall problem where you're struggling to find the only solution is nowhere in Fidel, where you're trying to make the best decisions you can, thinking into the middle, and long-terms.  Failing doesn't feel bad, becasue you feel like you're learning a skill.  Succeeding is grasping little optimizations, and understanding the quirks to best solving a problem.This is the only edge-of-the-seat puzzle game I've ever played.Fidel's great dude"

,Not Recommended,573170,34096852,Posted: 7 August,all,xer0,"I wanted this to be a relaxing puzzle game but the timer/ghost changes that dynamic. I know many players like a little pressure and say it's not a problem if you get better. For me it's an immediate turn off and I'm not interested in playing long enough to become ghost-proof. I'd rather have an option to just disable the ghost, so no timer and instant death. Making a mistake and then trying to correct it in a handful of seconds is just not fun for me.Other than that it's actually a cute game that broadens the line puzzle concept nicely. Discovering how the different enemies work and the imperfect levels forcing you to choose are clever additions."

For instance, I discovered after several matches that if you press enter you can switch the start and end squares, which is useful in some levels since the positioning of the enemies and loot is not symetric.

From the moment you see the opening screen for the first time, it becomes obvious that it's really well designed and polished, and absolutely charming.The first level of each game is always as a kind of ""tutorial"" used to teach you (or, rather, to let you discover by yourself) how the different enemies behave and the best way to approach them, and after that you start descending into a dungeon of randomly generated levels.As for the dungeon itself... it's much more rewarding if you discover for yourself everything that Fidel has to offer, but suffice to say that it's always varied, challenging and, above all, fun to play.Games usually last just a few minutes, but always manage to leave you wanting to come back for ""just another round"".On top of all this, it's also really cheap for everything that it has to offer, so... what are you waiting for?

,Recommended,573170,34099115,Posted: 8 August,all,bace,"Fidel Dungeon Rescue is a challenging puzzle game in which you move around a randomly generated dungeon of monsters without crossing your path. Everytime you ""attack"" a monster you lose some health, and everytime you move over a health pack you restore health. As you collect experience while you progress through the increasily difficult dungeon floors, you level up, causing the amount of health you have to increase, providing an incentive to maximum the experience you gain on each floor. While this may sound like a simple concept, there are enough secondary mechanics, interesting monster behaviours, and challenging trade-offs you must make to keep the gameplay varied and interesting. If you lose all your health or spent too long on a level, the ghost will appear to keep you on your toes. This provides a very fast-paced gameplay, while forcing you to pay careful attention to every move you make, even if there is an undo command.Unfortunately, the game is not without its flaws. The ghost can be an annoyance to those who want to take their time, or experiment without worry of having to start all over again. Furthermore I was unable to get my controller working with the game (although I suspect things like this will be patched in the future..?). Regardless, this game is highly enjoyable and I would recommend to anyone interested in puzzle games!"

The quick gameplay sessions allowed me to play it in my spare time, a thing I can't do with many games. If you don't have 60+ hours to put into a game but still want to enjoy a great experience, this is THE game to make that happen. Thanks for bringing this to life!"

Put simply this is game is a great little puzzler with a cute avatar, short but rewarding play sessions and a nice ramp up in difficulty to stump but never annoy!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CubsCscXbGk&index=4&list=PLrHW69YeI7GTKkg8foD1foI7uRhDfhCGJ"

You will adquire progressively the knowledge of the game, and how everything works, until you find yourself doing the puzzles at high speed without thinking much about it."

Very bad for productivity hehe!I really like the puzzles, I love all the things the author did with a few rules. The only things that I don't like are some punishing mechanics, like not being able to go back if my doggy dies (I go back but the ghost always catches me), and having a time/steps (not sure) pressure to complete a level (hate that ghost). Another thing that I felt is that there is a big increase in difficulty from level 1 to level 2. On my first try it was a bit intimidating, maybe on the first try I would have liked a few intermediate levels.Overall a really good game, if you like exploration, pixel art and logic puzzles, definitely check it out!"

,Recommended,573170,34217967,Posted: 13 August,all,MercilessMerc,"A simple but fun puzzle rogue-lite dungeon crawler. Prepare to die a lot, learning about the ghost and other enemy mechanics, but eventually you'll learn you have plenty of time to thoroughly consider your route on each level. Soon, you'll become experienced enough to rush through without dying, and beat the game on its normal difficulty, and that's when the real challenge begins! I haven't even beaten the unlockable hard mode, and with all of the secrets along the way, there is plenty of content to be had here, for a good price!"

,Recommended,573170,34911130,Posted: 12 September,all,jasonrohrer,"The best game that I've played in quite a long time.  A masterpiece of micro-design, with an insane amount of polish on every corner.It's a ""small"" game, but so deep that it takes quite a long time to work your way through it.  And just when you think you're done, a whole new layer unfolds for you.I just finished it, 15 hours in, but there are still a few loose ends left to tie up.Also, it takes quite a while to understand all the nuances that are present in even the earliest levels.  But you can still make your way through them without full mastery.  I recall a gradual process of getting it more and more on each pass through."
