76561198005947553,Not Recommended,573490,34717909,Posted: 3 September,all,ihavealamp,"Let's get this out first: this is a game with a huge amount of potential and I truly enjoy the core concepts, but it falls apart quickly due to a combination of poor AI, data transparency and UI design. Have put 10 hours into the game across three play-throughs, two of which went past 20 years, both of those having kicked off interstellar colonization.At this point I'm putting the game down and won't be coming back until some key items are addressed. I'm taking the time to put this together because I enjoy what the game could be and can easily see myself putting another 50+ hours into the game with some minor adjustments. Please take the feedback below in that lens.The Good:-Core delivery model - It's Space Truck Simulator 2017, plain and simple. All the right bones are there and when it clicks, it feels very good.-Theme comes through - I feel like I'm running a logistics company, spread across a harried amount of demands.-Runs well on my crap laptop - It's a really crap laptop and the game still loads super fast and handles quite well. Exceptions to this are when I'm spamming rockets with the ships and colony screen open, then it goes to crap.-Not fair - I'm a big fan of hard games that point you to a big wall and let you fall flat on your face. This certainly fits the bill, although there are issues here I'll address below.The Bad:-Very limited data transparency - I'll be honest, this is a huge one for me. This is at it's core a market game and we have no view of market prices. Big miss. Going beyond that, there's no view into the variables that impact things. Event (famine, etc.) modifiers, population supply/demand drivers, basic colony supply/demand view, potential growth view, fuel costs, maintenance costs, in transit goods view, company reputation impact, etc. None of this is icing on the cake stuff, it's all core requirements to having a market based game. Look to Paradox games for suggestions on top notch tool tip views.-Shoddy menu UI - I'm at the stage where I want to murder something every damn time I need to buy a new ship, especially once I'm in the mid-game 100+ ships deep. Let's order three ship copies for an existing delivery line... pause the game so the ship menu doesn't glitch out, find the ship in an unsortable list, duplicate the ship, edit and copy the ship name for consistency, oh it jumped back up to the top now scroll back down, rename the ship and save, oh it jumped back up to the top, let me scroll back down... sigh.-Terrible AI companies - There's not much to explain here, the AI companies will hold strong on unfair difficulty for the first 5 years or so and then start falling apart. Plenty of demand and money to be made, but they can't seem to make a steady profit beyond that point and collapse like a poorly made flan. This compounds the issue of growing colony needs, as the AI companies won't fill the gaps like they should, leaving it all up to the player.-No AI replacement or generation - The game doesn't seem to close out failing AI companies and refresh them, nor will it generate new companies on the fly for specific needs. Both of my 20+ year games have ended with only my company ships in the skies.-Unclear expectations - The game doesn't give you a feel for what's expected by colony. Part of this goes into the above, as the game doesn't outright tell you ""hey man, this planet really can't grow crap, you should really pay attention here,"" it'll just hit you with famines. Not to say it's not an indicator of failure, but it's not readily obvious out of the gate and certainly doesn't give you a feel for what to focus on until you have a game or two of failure under your belt.-No menu filtering - What I would give to be able to sort ships by route, or tag ships as certain types (food, passenger, etc.). Finding specific ships to view, copy, replace, etc. is really painful right now.What's Making Me Walk Away:-Crap AI companies-Poor menu UI-Extremely limited data viewLooking forward to what the game can become, especially after these key issues are addressed, but will be putting it down entirely until then. Completely understand that this is in an early alpha state, and that combined with how much I enjoy the core gameplay is why I'm taking the time to provide this feedback. Hope this helps, for what it's worth."

As there are multiple planets to settle in the starting system alone, you will be kept busy modifying creating and deleting new routes. You can develop the planets from tiny expeditions with a dirt landing to multi dozen milion populations with interstellar ports and industry.This game released on EA on 16th of August, and has already seen its first patch based on community feedback. It is still not without its bugs, but as far as EA goes, its very stable and has sufficient content to keep you koing. It needs only few minor tweak to be enjoyable for a very long time (think dozens of hours) at which point you will easily get your money's worth out of this game.Some things that seem to be missing and might reimain for some time, is customization, more in depth economy and late game balance. AI needs work too (tho it might have actually been partially fixed today), but the developers are very open minded and responsive to feedback.If you are still unsure, put the game on your watch list, as more tweaks patches and updates are said to be dropped in next few weeks; check youtube for some lets plays to give you a better idea on what you can expect."

A large variety of ships to choose from with an expanding list of destinations to supply that grow over time with evolving needs and resources to exploit.I'm very pleased with the experience so far.That said, this game is very buggy in its current state. Like with most Early Access games. At this time if you don't have the patience for buckets o' bugs, imbalances, and other weird stuff happening please wait for a more polished experience. If these things don't bother you and especially if you like being helpful with suggestions and pointing out issues you will be rewarded here in the long term.The dev so far has been responsive to questions and reports and active with updates and fixes. If this keeps up this game will be a real gem in the future."

Now, I have not played a lot of the game thus far and the games I have played weren't terribly long, but they were incredibly fun to play. As someone who enjoys business management kind of games, this was right up my alley, and it shows. Every little thing can change the balance of the game, star port got upgraded? Oh no, now the competition can get access to the planet. Famine starts? OH boy, more demand for food and water!I will be playing this more and more and checking out everything there is thus far. But from what I've seen, and combined with the somewhat constant updates (There was an update a day after I downloaded the game) I expect to get a lot of fun out of this game."

,Recommended,573490,34282231,Posted: 16 August,all,[PUG] Carson,"Before you buy, keep in mind that this is in early access for a reason. The game isn't close to the final product, but I see no reason to doubt that these devs will hold good on their plans.Interstellar Transport Company is a game in the transportation genre, it tries to simulate the logistics of human expansion from the near future to beyond. The game in it's current state is very fun, especially in multiplayer. There are some issues (multiplayer saves can't be loaded, hotjoin doesn't work yet, etc.) but these are being worked on, its the first day of release after all. The singleplayer is good, and the AI is okay (it will still buy hangars in random spots, ruining your beautiful bays.) but on easier difficulties it can be quickly surpassed by an experienced player.Overall, if you are interested in this concept, try the game out. It may have some flaws, but this game has some amazing potential."
,Recommended,573490,34336508,Posted: 18 August,all,Will2brown,"I have played this game for just over 2 hours at the time of writing this,bearing in mind that this game was release to early access just 2 days ago I think I have stumbled onto a gem.Pros:1.) Very complicated game, this means there is so much to learn about playing that you end up spending hours perfecting strategies, and given this is very early access, it will only get more complicated from here2.) Huge amounts of gameplay, Earth and the Moon is only the first step, gradually the game expands onto a much larger scope, with each knew planet and star system being new yet helpfully similar, meaning there is potentially hours of enjoyable, non repetitive gameplay in each game.3.) Competitive multiplayer gameplay (This feature is currently bugged, but is planned for future release) judging from how the game plays with one Human and multiple AI, there is the potential for incredibly competitive multiplayer games, as the basis of the game is to out compete your fellow space transport companies.Things I am not sure about being a pro or a con:1.) a simple tutorial system: the current tutorial (It will change as new features are implemented) is very simple, telling the player what each game system does, but not telling the player the best ways of effectively using each system to its advantage. I like this because it leaves the strategies to be figured out by the player, making the player spend hours figuring out what and when to do things.unfortunately this also may lead players to think the game is impossibly hard and cause them to quit.2.) the game is Very hard, at least in my opinion.this makes the game fun as it is a challenge to overcome but also can lead to boredom at failing every time you try to expand your buisness to mars instead of just the moon. (maybe I am just doing it so horrendously wrong that this isn't an issue?)cons:1.) a bit buggy in its current state, but no more than is to be expected of an early alpha2.) Multiplayer is bugged, and custom matches bugged the last few times I tried them, nothing majour though, they will likely get patched/ implemented quite soon.Summary:A fun game with nice visuals and huge potential in the future. This is the type of game I, and likely many other players have been searching for."
76561198009509328,Recommended,573490,34401538,Posted: 21 August,all,Hopdevil,"This game is fun.  Easily worth the $20 they are asking for it.Trade is dynamic.   Meaning, as you fill the demands your profit margins shrink.   So you cannot just set up routes and forget them.   This forces you to plan ahead and at times subsidize less profitable routes knowing they will become profitable later.Right now it's a ton of fun.  The roadmap of features to come look like they will make the game much better.  At the same time it's not overly ambitous.   So hopefully it will be done before too long.  The fact that so much of the game is already there inspires confidence in what the eventual final product will be.I recommend you buy it.   But if you decide not to, keep an eye on the store page for sales and the eventual full release.  It can only get better."

The first 3 hours playing this game just flew by without me noticing - I was lost in the details, trying to maximise my profits like a latinum-hungry Ferengi.While it appears there is a lot that needs to be improved and implemented, this is a very promising start. Keep up the great work devs!"

Almost every single thing I could think of to suggest(and then some) is already on their design document apparently.It's already fun to play for a few hours until it starts stuttering due to the hundred or so ships running around the solar system(alpha is alpha afterall) despite its early alpha state and the features to come make me very excited to see how this game develops.I'm also very optimistc about it reaching completion. The developer is very active and responsive to player feedback, even if it's just to let me know that they are already aware of the issues I had with some of the GUI. So I feel confident to say that this game is not going to go the way of abandonware if they have anything to say about it."
76561197970967930,Recommended,573490,34486347,Posted: 25 August,all,A Pimpfo named Info,"24th of September 2017:The changes to the ship UI in 0.16 focus on the ship management. The ship UI in it's prior form was troublesome to manage as it was static outside of individual ship updates.The new UI adds more information and a host of filters which help with management,as well as AI improvements that brings them to a whole new level.10th of September 2017:Last week the game was updated to 0,14 which rebalances ships, adds a few mechanics and gave us some new bugs to report. ;)Most importantly though, it moved back expiration date on some ships significantly in lieu of those that will be added in time. Thus allowing those who want to play beyond 100 years in-game time to do so now.26th of August 2017:A major patch broke the game, but the 2 devs got it back up and working as intended in just 12 hours.Inital review:Do note that this game is in an alpha stage, there are a lot of winky wonkies which need to be bypassed with manual actions to get the most out of the game right now.For example, the game should always be paused when you have your ships menu open or it will cause massive lagspikes as soon as you own a few ships. As long as you do not mind and can work around such things, the game is very enjoyable and holds a lot of promise.The current state is a an arrangement of figuring out your preffered method of lucrative trades, there are some short term and long term options avaliable, but for now they mainly differ based on how much of an investment you choose to make and the variation of strategy that is avaliable is a bit limited, albeit you need to pay attention and act to tackle money-sinks smoothly to get the most out of the trade as a lot of it can be limited - depending upon your own and opponents choice of action.The two devs that work on this is very active and chat with the EA players that want to over on Discord, taking suggestions and ideas live as well as updating us on what is the ongoing tasklist. I'd say this game is just about halfway there, but the foundation is very solid so I bealive in this title and it's future development."
,Recommended,573490,34366492,Posted: 19 August,all,Marcus,"This game is Capitalism 2/Capitalism Lab in space. It's amazing. It's the most fun I've had in a tycoon-type game since RCT3.The easy way to make money at the beginning of the game is to bring water, food and colonists to the Moon which kinda becomes your mining place, then choose between sending your raw materials to either Earth or developing a base on Mercury.Eventually you'll have to colonize Titan for the crystals that are used to get to the rest of the solar system, but that's a bit of a dumpster fire right now in my game because I heavily favor high-capacity ships over fast ships and it's causing famine and drought on Titan and I now have an influx of refugees to Earth. It's fine. I'm a survivor, not a victim.Two weaknesses:1) It's early access which means it's got a bug or two. Nothing that caused a crash to desktop, but I did have to restart my game once.2. It's not optimized. After 5+ hours of a single play session on a single save (yes, it's THAT fun) my 6700K was brought to its knees any time I opened the ""ships"" window. It was fine when I closed that window even with tons of other stuff happening on screen."

As I can see by now (aug. 2017) the developers move in the right direction about features, balance and all stuff. :)You should be aware that the game is still in an Alpha stage. Also the game does not teach you how to be competitive and successful, so you have to figure it out in a hard way. :)"
76561197977555389,Recommended,573490,34556733,Posted: 28 August,all,ajar1189,"This game is a logistics simulator with a space theme.You play as a space trucking company competing against up to 7 others (up to 7 AI in single player games; haven't tried multiplayer yet). Supply and demand drives prices for resources that you need to transport between planets and moons as humanity colonizes the solar system and beyond. Choose different types of ships for your transport fleet based on your needs. Some ships are faster than others, carry more cargo, are more reliable, etc.I started off binging on this game as it was alot of fun to get into (and i really like logistics for some reason). I slowed down a bit later, since the game can get a bit repetitive and overwhelming with the amount of ships you have. However, I find myself thinking about new strategies and wanting to test them out, an so I do. There is not a ton of depth, but the game's core seems to be built in such a way that would allow for alot of extra features and such from the devs.Pros:-Gameplay is pretty fun with a decent amount of strategy involved.-Runs well on low-end systems (so I've heard)-The game's foundation and core lends itself to being expanded upon alot-Dev team seems extremely active (especially for only 4 people total on the project?) and has released like 4-5 patches in less-than-two week period since the game has been in EA.-$20 price point seems spot-on.Cons:-Can be a bit boring if you're not that into logistics simulation.-Has some bugs that can be fairly impactful to gameplay (what EA game doesn't?)-Some UI elements and data transparency needs to have added elements (transaction history, price, etc), but basic UI so far is pretty decent.With any early access game, you need to be wary about the product your are buying. However, with the current game state (I still have fun playing it) and the dev activity (extremely active), I have no regrets buying this game and anticipate a lot of cool new features to be added to this game to really flesh out this gaming experience. At $20, this game has already given me more gameplay time than many other $20+ games.As of now I would probably give this game a 7/10 in its current EA state. I'm looking forward to see how this game progresses and have high hopes for the future."

The AI and I started sending ships back and forth from the moon and everything was ok. By the second year the AI totally vanished. No ships anywhere and they were negative a few hundred grand. The AI has no idea how to make money I guess.Went and took over Mercury and Venus, then suddenly at year 2061, the AI suddenly decided to start back up and started using nothing but 1 way rockets to Europa. Year 2068 now and still nothing but single use rockets, most of which are only carrying a couple food, not even fully loaded.Its early access so Ill cut it some slack, but still the AI really needs to get fixed for this to be playable."

This game is everything a management and sci fi lover could dream of, this game lets you be a trading tycoon who shapes the solar system by transporting goods with ever increasingly capable ships. Although the interstellar part of the game needs to be fleshed out and more ships and gameplay should be added like more infrastructure on the planets and hopefully space infrastructure, the solar system trading is extremely fun and tense with challenging AI making sure you have to fight to earn your place in the market. Really good potential and suggest you buy it even now."
76561198030752471,Recommended,573490,35229030,Posted: 26 September,all,Valzin22,"Excellent:Theme. The game brings this out very well. It really feels like you are running the company that is responsible for the interstellar expansion of humanity. The visuals work well. The planets look cool. The ships have fun names. The line of ships you get going from home, out a colony, and back looks good. It is satisfying to see the progress as a colony develops. It feels like you are working to established permanent homes other worlds.Strategy. You have a lot of choices. You are always deciding what ships to buy, what they should carry, and what route they should take. You usually have options that are either ""cheaper and better now"" or ""more expensive and better later."" You always have ""things to work on."" You can choose where new colonies will go. You can tinker with current trade routes to make them more profitable.Good to Mixed:Balance. The overall balance seems good for what has been released. There are subtle changes that could improve things, and I think the devs have their eye on that. (They have made a few balance changes since the game was released and all the changes were steps in the right direction.) Later game stuff does need more work, and this is on the dev roadmap forward.Replayablilty: Generally one game versus another does progress in a similar way. You have information about what is needed and you take care of that. If Mars needs more water you buy a new water ship and send it to Mars. You can get a long way just by playing this way. That said, after a few games you understand more of the subtlties and can min/max your trade routes. I find that I enjoy trying to minimize extra costs and squeeze out maximum profit.The UI. The UI has improved greatly with the latest patch. It seems that this is where the devs are currently focusing. It does take some getting used to, but with the new changes I feel like I have the tools I need.The AI. I have played a number of games both with AI opponents and as the only company. Honestly, I've never felt like the AI opponents add much to the game. In games with AI opponents, they sometimes help get colonies going a bit faster, but usually I just notice them doing thing that I wouldn't do because it's inefficient. Generally they serve as a minor hinderance. By late game the AI doesn't have much of a presence. For me, the game is less about beating my opponents, and more about establishing a huge interstellar trade network. Whether the AI is present or not only affects that a little. Also, I have found games without AI opponents to be more fun. Without the AI you have more control in things like in fine-tuning demand without causing famine and deciding what colonies should get limited resourses. If playing against a competitive AI is important to you, this game might not be the right choice. If you aren't worried about the AI and your priority it to build up your trade empire, the weak AI won't hinder that. Also try playing without any AI opponents.Reasons to wait a bit:Lack of detailed information. Much of the financial numbers are ""under the hood"" at this point. There are ways to estimate the cost of a given trade route if you work it out. The calulations that go into how much a route earns is a mystery. The Devs have said that this is on their radar.There are a few bugs (It's still in alpha). The devs have been doing a good job of dealing with these, but some can be annoying. That said, in my last game, there weren't any bugs that prevented me from making progress.Overall:I'm having a lot of fun. The theme is great. Bringing 500 million people to an interstellar Earth-like planet is satisfying. I find that I want to try out new strategies and maximize my income. The devs are working to make the game better, and it is improving. I certainly think it is worth the price in its current state."

I really hope the devs keep adding to the game and make a load of much needed changes and additions the game sorely needs as, as it is right now, although playable it needs a lot of love. For a economic trading game it doesnt give you enough information, it tells you supply and demand but doesnt go anyt further than saying it wants ""this"" and supplies ""this"" and although a lot of other games have done similar in the past to good effect, this game leaves you feeling unconnected and detached and not really involved in the planets success or failure. Also there doesnt seem to be any real reason to spend your own companies money on buildings on a planet as there doesnt seem to be any real positive from doing it besides from being able to sell more of that resource as the planet takes ownership of the building. To me that seems pretty stupid, I spend 290,000 of my own money to find that all ive done is made it that theres more resources on the planet that anyone can buy and I make nothing from it except what I ship myself. would rather spend my money on a ship and buy the resource elsewhere. also I thought you would be able too corner markets or even whole planets but atm it doesnt seem like you can at all, all your doing is buying a ship setting up a route and sending it off to make money to buy another ship and carry on the process without feeling like your accomplishing anything, or getting anything out of it on the whole. also atm your reputation on planets doesnt seem to have any real effect to yourself or the game at first i was buying a  headquarters on a planet thinking it would benefit me but then noticed my reputation was pretty much the same as i was delivering too on planets without a headquarters. But its not all bad even though im making it sound like it is. Its only in alpha, and the core of the game is there and it has the possibilty in becomming a great game but it needs a lot of work and attention.i doubt il play the game over the next few months, but I will come back and I am hoping the devs will of put atleast some of the things it needs into the game to make it feel immersive and like your actually doing something worthwhile."

You also need to balance yourself against the AI that is also supplying, affecting demand... it felt like spamming one shot rockets in the beginning was the only way to give yourself a necessary boost of cash to compete easily with the AI, this still seems to to be ongoing throughout the game... spamming rockets to make some extra cash while managing an entire fleet feels like a click fest, speeding up and slowing the game down.6hrs or so in, here's the issues you run into...The game starts to get less personal, you are dealing with bubbles (planets) and floating icons (ships) no detail anymore... this takes away any visual detail the game has to offer.You are manually going to each planet (or supply route) ensuring your ships are meeting the correct demand and they are turning a profit, this starts to get slightly exhausting because the UI isn't built efficiently for this.The scale of this game is huge and tapping into 1/10 of this game makes you wonder how they will keep the player engaged... you get to a point where you are cycling through planets and maximizing routes and thats it... and that's only 1/10 of the possible management... too much with little reward if at any... unless you just like dots and seeing money rise...It would be interesting to see where this game goes in 6-12 months... if you want something more finished, I'd definitely wait, they are still tweaking major aspects of the base game while breaking a few things along the way at times."

76561198019994180,Recommended,573490,34347545,Posted: 19 August,all,xfx888,"Lots of potential for this game, and only really held back by the need for optimization. There's a sense of expansion at every step, and there's a sense of grandeur as you build your trading empire. However, if you haven't already figured out, there's really only one path currently to succeed at the game.Hints if you are struggling to keep away from bankruptcy:Machine and rare material production simply does not ramp up quickly enough, so it's pointless building machinery cargo on your ships. Right now, machinery is a newbie trap. Let the bots transport machinery, since it will quickly run out on Earth. You can get away with transporting only a small amount to make a little bit at the beginning of the game. Otherwise you will be wasting a lot of cargo room.Once you unlock Jupiter's moons and the Gorman Dart, you can just transport 30-40% passengers and the rest water/food, and demand for food and water will quickly rise on that moon, activating a subsidy. You can easily just make millions off of it. I found this to be a very reliable way of racking up a large sum of money quickly.Another tip is simply to cash in on Luna, then get to transporting food/water/passengers to Mars quickly. Luna makes a lot of money early, but it becomes pretty competitive once the AI starts transporting stuff. You will usually find yourself losing money after the development reaches 100%.Currently, development and population doesn't seem to have a large effect on resource production and resource profile. I hope that the devs will update this, so then planets can begin to produce more rare minerals and detritium."

And while there's still stuff I haven't done which I may do just to see if it changes my impression, I think, for the most part, I'm largely done.It's a nice looking game, and there's much I like about it. But it has two gaping problems.The first is depth - you can set up routes and ships to run on them, and fiddle them to make a profit. But once you've done that, it's just an exercise in doing it a bit more, and making a bit more money. There doesn't seem to be a goal. Even the inclusion of AI competitors is a bit shallow - because the AI never stops you from doing anything you might otherwise do. They're just there as decoration.The second problem the game has is clutter. Most games like this, there are two ways of playing - conservatively where you gradually build up your organisation; or spamming. And whatever mode you play, the AI spams. As a result, very quickly, the shipping lanes are full of ships. Hundreds of them. And caring about the fate of your handful of ships in a universe where they awash with hundreds of other ships is difficult. They just become blocks to build your bottom line, and they essentially disappear.This is a game in progress, and added depth and reduced clutter may happen down the track. But for now, it's a cute game with a limited lifespan."

I encountered a UI bug, for example, where I couldn't give one of my ships a route.The game needs far more randomness and depth imo, it just feels like those moble games where you tell some planes to fly to different cities, ie, not a game that you can just sit down with and enjoy.I feel like this game is trying to go for the OpenTTD vibe, and what really seperates this game from OpenTTD's beauty is the lack of building train tracks and roads. I like to be able to make my own designs more efficient, not just buy another spaceship or terminal gate.I bought this game on sale for $18 and I can't recommended it for even that discounted price."
