,Recommended,573520,29074176,Posted: 6 January,all,geodude140,"Fun little platforming game that gets pretty difficult pretty fast. Cute characters, good level design, unique boss fights; what else could you ask for? Would make for a fun speedrun (^:"
,Recommended,573520,29072486,Posted: 6 January,all,Mister Misty,"This low budget indie game is bursting with charm, snappy music, and good old fashioned platforming challenge.Check this one out, it'll make you happy for a little while.[ADDENDUM]Now I'm sure there's gonna be some jackwagons complaining about the price seeing as this game is only a couple hours long, but five dollars is totally worth it. That game costs less than a movie for the same length of entertainment, and this game is a whole lot better than most of the movies coming out this month, that's for sure."
,Recommended,573520,29078257,Posted: 6 January,all,LolzLolzFTW,"Short game, but it's worth the $5 just for the consistent fun and charm it provides.  Seriously, this game will give you a serious case of the nonstop smiles."
,Recommended,573520,29124005,Posted: 8 January,all,YellowAfterlife,"A small and charming game.Pros:Art style is simple but consistent. Gets it's themes across.Difficulty is moderate - not easy enough to be boring, not hard enough to ragequit.Increases gradually, ""croaktel"" mode being a harder than ""crowtel"".Levels are very decently made, with no off-screen or instant-kill hazards.Neutral:Isn't a long game - 2-ish hours to complete, plus 1..3 hours to play through developer commentary and challenges.Neither does it cost much, though.Also means that even the harder achievements (speedrun / no deaths) aren't too frustrating since you aren't loosing hours per attempt as with many other games.Cons:Firing requires button-mashing, with a on-screen projectile limit. This is by no means new and adds a risk-reward scheme where you can get dangerously close to things to quickly take them out, but personally I'm not a huge fan.~15 minutes into ""crowtel"" mode you get a ""charge up"" attack which then becomes a preferred method of dealing with enemies but in ""croaktel"" there isn't anything like that.The game could use a setting to separately adjust sound/music volume.Overall the game's nice and pros outweight the cons in my opinion."

,Recommended,573520,29081271,Posted: 7 January,all,Floof Cheeks,"Fun, simple, and charming! Don't let the short play time ruffle your feathers, it's unique and memorable and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it! This game is definitely something to crow about and it'll certainly caws you to smile!"

,Recommended,573520,29073018,Posted: 6 January,all,Snork,"DISCLAIMER: I REALLY LIKE BIRDS THEY ARE CUTE AND SMART AND FLUFFY AND I FEED THEM CUTTLEFISH TO KEEP THEIR BEAKS STRONG.I HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME SINCE BEFORE THIS GAME WAS EVEN MADE SO I HAVE BIG EXPERT OPINIIN ON THIS GAME AND EVEN THO MY PLAYTIME IS ONLY 2 HOURS IIVE ACTUALLY PLAYED FOR LIKE 800 HOURS ACCUMULATED SO IM BETTER NYA NYAH.Crowtel is a game where the bird wants to make their hotel good, but people want to tell him their hotel is bad. So he has to find the people who are making him look bad.On the surface this story seems fairly basic, but play the second episode and then the story is still basic but it's nice anyways. i think it's better than the main game.I think crow is very cute and I hope he does well in this disgusting hospitality industry because management is hell and i wouldn't wish it on anyone especially not a bird.$5 is fine, quite being poor."

,Recommended,573520,29131358,Posted: 8 January,all,Count Mippi,"A fun little game with a chirpy bird and chirpy music.  You'll probably beat it in less than an hour if you're decent at platformers, but I still got my money's worth."
,Recommended,573520,29107122,Posted: 7 January,all,Hotel Bones,"I already beat the original title when it was released on itch.io however the ""renovated"" version presents more content WHERE YOU PLAY AS A FROG. The difficulty in this game should not be taken for granted as it becomes more difficult as it progresses. Also this game is just the dandiest charm jiggler ever. Seriously, watch it jiggle that charm."

,Not Recommended,573520,33065420,Posted: 30 June,all,Tillburg,"GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: 37% YES /63% NOGOODMusic is adorably retro.Characters are simple and clean.Two small adventures in one.NEUTRALAlmost every single boss can be dps rushed. No need for strategy or dodging, just stay in one place and blast away.Sound effects range from decent to low effort. For example the thuds for foot steps sound good but the cries from ghosts are bad.BADTiming on the icicles is too tight which causes the snow areas to be way too annoying.Physics on water propelling you up to jump feels unreliable and goofy.Some ghost enemies are designed to pop out of furniture, which is fine, but they pop out at face distance so you're almost guaranteed to get hit if you didn't know it was there ahead of time.SUMMARYThe cost is low but the experience is mostly filled with annoyances and wondering why icicles are your new bane. I wanted to find this charming and enjoyable, but the gameplay just didn't warrant me putting in effort most of the time. Too many puzzles and bosses can be solved by just standing still."
76561198240777776,Recommended,573520,29073894,Posted: 6 January,all,skidmarktwain,"My team and I were going over surveillance footage from one of our cold cases when one of our interns pointed out that the tatoo on the perp's left buttocks was something called a 'steam code'...We set about investigating this breakthrough and found that this code was in fact for a game called Crowtel Renovations.  At first we couldn't make much of it until our behaviour analyst stepped in and infformed us that this 'game' was in fact a freudian allagory that could possibly be the closing lead.According to our analyst:-This hotel is in fact representative of the victim, cluttered and unkempt...reaching out for help but avoiding it when it arrives (note the giant head in the upper levels, note how it will openly avoid the phone).-These cat inspectors represent all that looks to sabotage this person as they reach out for help under the guise of authoritarian, 'we're here to help you' nonsense whilste only showing there true colors when confronted and relenting and willing to make a deal once undone.-The crow itself represents the inner struggle of the deceased, trying to clean things up in a true mannor before outside influences bring everything to an end.The case is still under investigation but we salute this 'Sink' individual for having the courage to put this raw, unbridled creation out into the public at large so everyone can take a good long look at his take on the doings of societies underbelly.  We don't know how that steam code got onto the street-walker in the footage but we can all sleep better knowing you're fighting the good fight.9.75/10"

,Recommended,573520,29456657,Posted: 23 January,all,emit renob butb,"Crowtel Renovations is a fun little game that doesn't take itself too seriously and plays a lot like an early nineties budget NES title. Every design choice for this game seems to be made around the question of ""what would be the most charming way to do this?""Crowtel is really short, but it's not frustrating (frequent check points) and stays fresh from beginning to end. Bonus: It includes a nice little side story game about Lilly the fatalist frog, so you can do that, too."
,Recommended,573520,32883204,Posted: 27 June,all,RapperGerste,Such a lovely and fun game (except Croaktel which was hard af).Can only recommend it good job developer and thanks!
