I dont like gun sounds though-feels like airsoft little bit. graphics is cool, idea is very good."
,Recommended,574080,30104661,Posted: 22 February,all,FSgt. A. Switz [3rd MAR],"Fog of War places you in the middle of the Eastern Front on a warm summer day with a sort of Frank Miller (Director of ""300"") thing going on making it all dark and gloomy that reflects the ugliness of the Eastern Front during the height of the German Offensive.Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a slower and somewhat lone wolf style of gameplay mixed in with brief moments of the need for good teamwork and timing.The GoodThe maps are very large and with Company Commanders able to move Forward Operating Bases (FOB's) around, the lines shift constantly and Intel on enemy forces FOB locations mixed in with some strategic indirect fire from your teammates can devastate your opponent.Some of what makes this game a possible great game is perhaps by accident.  Tanks require two players to operate.  A driver and then a gunner.However, the targeting system is very bare bones and very slow to swivel and find infantry unless you and your driver communicate.  The driver can only see directly in front of them and the gunner can swivel around slowly.  Often times in matches you will here tank crews (who perform well) work together by having the driver point the tank in the enemies direction and calling out compass coordinates to the gunner.  If it where not for that communication, the tank would not have any impact due to the gunner not knowing where threats are coming from.It is these types of imperfections and difficulty that actually turn out to be for the best and there are a few other areas in this game that are like that such as needing two men to rotate field guns to adjust aim, spotters to help mortarman zero in on a target and so on.Finally, enough cannot be said about how vital and important heavy weapons, armor, vehicles and artillery are.  They are each very hard to take out and truly precious in every match.  To give an example, my team was getting nowhere trying to reach an objective with an enemy T-34 holding its ground directly in front of our next objective.  It took 4 anti-tank gunners hitting him simultaneously to take him out all the while having support infantry mask our movements with smoke grenades when the T-34 zeroed in on one of our positions.It is moments like these that will make this game great.The BadThe game currently falls flat in a few areas which I will get into.    Not enough mechanics are in place to encourage teamwork.  In fact, not enough is also to dissuade ""too much teamwork"" in that players spending all of their points for a tank for example can be immediately hijacked by a new player who gets to it before you do and goes off and drives it into a lake because he does not know the map well.- The in game map is pretty useless.  It is an obvious placeholder, however, you can tell it was very rushed.  It does not even have coordinates on the maps frames at least.- There is also a in game compass.  However, it does not work while inside vehicles.  May be a possible bug.  I hope not on purpose.  As this can really help tank crews out.- STG's and PPSH automatics are way too strong currently.- The core gameplay and for how a team wins is done by who holds objectives the longest.  If a team holds a objective long enough they win it and a new obective in another part of the map is made which is very fun as you now see a mad rush to get there that resembles the Blitzkrieg with infantry and vehicles all racing ahead.  The only downfall is that this occurs only three times.  More objectives should be added to make the matches last longer.- Bugs.  Naturally, a Alpha build will have them.  But nothing game breaking ATM other than a few people who cannot start the game at all.RatingsVISUAL - 4/10Visually the models, weapons and assets are impressive.  But the map assets and textures are pretty HL1.  Even on Ultra, it fell more like 2001's ""Darkest Days"" than anything you would expect to see this day in age.  One thing lacking as far as core gameplay is involved is some sort of hit indication.  There is blood so if the target is next to a structure you will see some splatter, but for those long range shots it is hard to tell if you are even hitting close to the target or not.SOUND - 6/10Not much immersion as of yet.  Just a dead quite battlefield other than what players are doing.  The weapons themselves sound a bit unpolished.  But they are good enough.  The sound occlusion to determine where shots are being fired are very good for a UE game.WEAPONS - 6/10The creators look to be going for a very realistic approach with heavy weapon sway in ADS, no teammate icons, slow shooting, slow moving...etc etc etc approach.  The weapons feel very clunky and hard to control.  In addition, the developers added weapon sway while in normal movement where your weapon would not remain directly in front of you but could be moved to the very far left or right depending on which way you look thus making it even more impossible to ever feel confident behind your weapon.GAMEPLAY 8/10The current gameplay is there to be enjoyed.  It is just the rest of the game that makes it not as fun as it could be.  More emphasis needs to be made on forcing teamwork and language barriers.OVERALL 6.5/10As a EA I can see the potential and it grows on you the more you play.What it needs to be EpicWith a little time and effort this game has a lot of potentiol.  What will launch it to the big leagues are (and some, if not all are in the plans but not currently in the game yet):✦ New theaters of war, currently all the maps look like they are in the same region and all look alike.✦ More dynamic (not predictable) map objective advancements and new game modes.✦ Lesson Automatics (who also have a Anti Tank grenade).  Replace with more Field Anti-Tanks that spawn every 20 minutes and add a Bazooka class or purchase option.✦ Gear the game to force more teamwork.  Buffs if working inside zones platoon and company commanders are present.  Better order system and VOIP✦ Force newly purchased equipment such as Tanks to only be operated by the person who bought it.✦ Allow Steam Workshop intigration for community created content on private servers******Everything below this line are for many of my friends who come from the games below******Comparing it to Days of WarMany of the bugs we see in DoW are here as well.  Granted, it is using the same engine so that explains a lot.  The grenade system is how DoW was in Alpha phase where they would glitch at 1 FPS and randomly explode somewhere 10 seconds later.  Hit Registry was very bad, or could had been due to a lot of rubber banding and high ping.  Gameplay is 80% slower and weapons are not even near the same caliber.They are similar in that MG's have tracer rounds, bullet impact debris on hard surfaces and not much health.Would not recommend.Comparing it to WW1 SourceInaccurate and hard to control weapons, large openness all point to you guys may being able to enjoy this game some.  The weapon sway they use is a lot like RnL as well and that should be familiar, but it does not handle the same.  However, the lack of action may get to you.  It takes a long time before any actual territory is gained or lost.  And like WW1 Source, all it takes is a coordinated push since it is so hard to shoot anything.Recommended!"
,Recommended,574080,30233979,Posted: 27 February,all,Bl00merz,"As with any Early Access game that was just released, people will tend to write negative reviews on how broken it is. Ignore those people... Fog of War was released less than a week ago...Now, I know I have only played for about 90 minutes so far. You'd think I'd be underqualified to write a review with such little play time, and it's probably premature to write anything at the moment anyways, so the following review may be lacking as far as details, but I'll probably rewrite it in a few weeks :/The ReviewThere have been a lot of new WWII games that have been released recently. From Day of Infamy, to Days of War, to Battalion 1944, there has been a huge wave of WWII games releasing on Steam in the past few months. Fortunately, Fog of War isn't a carbon copy of those three games. This is one of the more tactical and slower-paced titles on Steam, so if you love Squad, Red Orchestra, Rising Storm, or even the older Battlefield games (before EA went south), you will probably like this title too.Like it was mentioned before, Fog of War is still in Early Access, There are a lot of features and new content on the way, and the devs seem like they will be in this for the long haul, so don't expect them to abandon it like a lot of the other Early Access titles out there.That being said, if you have a low tolerance for bad textures, choppy animations, and the occasional cancerous chatter in voice chat, do not buy this game at this time. But if you can look past that, I can see some people pulling a couple all-nighters playing FoW. The maps are huge, which makes the gameplay very dynamic, unlike titles such as Heroes and Generals. The buildings are destructable, which means you will be moving from cover to cover when capping points.Also, the reward system's concept is balanced and has meaning put into it, where you have to score a certain amount of points in order to spawn in tanks and elite soldiers, instead of being able to spawn willy-nilly with whatever you've already unlocked or bought like in Heroes and Generals. Coupled with a limit as to how many elite units can be on the battlefield, it makes sense that only the players that actually play and win get rewarded, instead of having some noob hog the slots and ruin the gameplay for everyone. And if there is a cancerous player, then your entire team can vote to kick him from the match.All in all, Fog of War is still in it's Alpha stages. There will be bugs here and there, but development seems to be going smoothly. There isn't a lot of content right now either, but I'm pretty sure that will change very soon. If you want to give it a try, go ahead and buy it. I think I'll be keeping this title around for a while. :)"

Because all the reviews anly seem to have one issue with the game, the fact that there is no players. There is not going to be any players with these reviews.I would suggest that you read all these bad reviews and really think why they gave the thumps down.It's not the game.The game seems to be very very well made.It's basically what squad promises to be in WW2 settings.It already has a very well tought out squad system that prevents everyone to be snipers.By playing you get points that act as money. With that money you by yourself a role, any role if it's available.The price of the role makes it hard for anyone to be a tank commander. Tank commander costs nearly 5000 points.When basic rilfeman costs about 100 or so.In the game you get points for capturing areas.What is unique about this game that besides that it's very well made (Very beautifull and runs very well atleast for me. Weapon handling is exelent as are the sounds. It has in game communication system that seems very much the same as squads system.) is that it has very wide range of weaponry. Besides the usual infantry weapons it has mortars, tanks and antitank artillery.If these things seem good to you in a game, help this game by getting it and becoming a player. If there's enough of players there's going to be players in the game. Then we can start making reviews about the actual game itself instead of complaining that it does not have any players."

The game itself feels like an arcade version of RO2 with elements of SQUAD in them. I honestly think it'll be a pretty good game with everything is sorted out. Always found decent matches with decent ping. theres a spike here and there everyonce in awhile but they can fix that it's not a big deal. Would recommend for a early access.

The other negative reviews are unfair to the devs who really want to get a spring board like Squad. Squad had ""mixed"" reviews when it was first released because it was too ""buggy"", now its one of the more popular FPS's on Steam.This game is worth the $15 ($11.24 at the time of review) to keep the devs going on perfecting this game."

76561198262799780,Recommended,574080,30113726,Posted: 22 February,all,Lassital,"In the short amount of time I've spent learning the basics, I've found that I quite enjoy it for what it is. Currently its very small as I suppose not many are willing to throw down $12 on a game with little to no PR, and a 30% review on steam in the first half-hour.That said, its an absolute blast!The gunplay is a joy to use. Two things you may not like, is that the standard issue bolt action takes 2 hits to fully kill and that there is not much hit regesitry. Automatic guns, though not immensly accurate, easily make up for it in volume.  But the Bolt actions range will greatly make up for it.Feild artillery and mortars are powerful, but so far I havent seen much of them, nor really used them (when the issues with the servers are resolved and allow for more than 16v16s, as they are unfortunately capped at, Im sure they will become prominate. Tanks however are fairly rare and extremely helpful. Again, watch out as you can have an infantry throw 2 anti tank grenades on you and take you out.Biggest thing you need in this game, is teamwork. This is a team focused game and you should always be focusing on teammates. Mortars can only be set up with two men. Artillery needs to be towed to be useful, but that requires a nother person to spawn and tow it. Tankers need tank gunners. And infantry needs transport.As for the lag, yes its noticable. But with the 32 player cap, its managable.Graphically, it leaves some to be desired. And with only one map, it's sure to be stale soon. But for now, it this wonderfully fun little meal that I intend to eat warm. $10 for allot of fun, albiet shortly, aint too bad in my opinion."
76561197962794603,Recommended,574080,30499200,Posted: 13 March,all,Wingnut,I think best way too describe this game is Heroes & Generals or the Battlefield series meets the Red Orchestra series. This game takes care of my primary complaints about said comparisons. H&G/BF not being realistic and RO not having big enough maps. I think it hits a sweet spot in the middle with realism with big open maps similar to Squad or the Arma series. It has a lot of potential no doubt about that. It's still rough around the edges which is expected since Early Access just kicked off less than a month ago.
,Recommended,574080,30141179,Posted: 24 February,all,Vene,"Fog of War is an amaizing WWII Title which combines the mechanics of games like Insurgency and Red Orchestra which makes for a great gaming experience if familiar with those games. Despite it being in Alpha, it has a lot of focus on teamwork which requires players to work together instead of working as lone wolves. The game also features support weaponary like light tanks and artillery which can give a great advantage if used correctly.

,Recommended,574080,30104991,Posted: 22 February,all,Battle8111 [8thMB],"Keep in mind, I have played this game BRIEFLY, and I want to update this review as the game progress as its in Early Access.Fog of War, in my opinion, is a mix of Heroes and Generals (H&G) and Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad (RO2).Wise of the mechanics it takes from H&G is the leveling system, I have not totally explored this in depth, so I am not sure how ""grindy"" this is, but this is a comparsion that in some sort of sense could be good, or it could go horribly wrong like H&G. Also I guess in the sense of large battles, but RO2 has that as it is. Also from the movement system, it feels very much like H&G...Now here comes RO2 likeness of the game. The game's gun mechanic is quite good, guns feel right and hit home on targets, I really only experimented with the mosin, but from observing how other player used the GW43, MG42, SVT-42, PTRS? and the PPSH-41 all seem pretty good. Though some balancing might need to be done to those weapons, this gun play in this game is overall heading in the right direction, compared to H&Gs gunplay which is not very good.Now, since this game is in Early Access, there are gonna be some immediate issues you are going to run into...Server Lag:The servers seem to lag really bad with desync with the vehicles and grenades. Gun-fire and player movement seems mostly unaffected though by this lag (strangely).Graphics:I played the game on Max settings and its not very good looking, wise of a game's graphics though, I honestly don't care how good it looks so long the game is fun and runs well. Also I can see the graphics being improved in the future.Performance:The game runs decently for an Early Access game, it has frame drops regularly, but it personally did not affect my gameplay, and I can see this being smoothed out in the near future.Overall, the game needs a lot of work, but from what I seen from playing in this short amount of time, it takes some of the best concepts from popular games that I enjoy. I recommend this game for its low price of 11 dollars (roughly) and is worth the buy now to support the developers and see this game improve.Its heading in the right direction.Again, I want to update this review as the game progress and improve it to cover new improvements and features."

I mean people give it a thumbs down and say ""has potential"" or ""No one plays"" which to me seems a little counterintuitive.Does it make sense? Thumb a game down and tell people not to buy it, yet complain nobody's playing. Hilarious the logic in that.IT'S AN ALPHA!!!!!Now we know it's not polished and perfect but it's a very fun game when you have a good group playing and awsome WW2 fire fights. The Graphics are pretty good and the Game is Stable (Unreal Engine 4). The Developers are good and care about it too. In the last little while I had this game there's been many updates and tweaks for the better. Monkeys Lab Listens. If you got a gripe go to Discussion section and gripe FFS, not on a review.For the price I'd say it worth it. Sit on it and wait. Check the servers periodically and you may be pleasantly surprized. 75% of the thumbs down are people that have less than an hour on it. Probably check server once and review. Trust me, I've had many many good games on this with 30 people or so. It just needs more people and praise. Still very fresh and new.Gameplay is like a combo of Red Orchestra 2 and Squad. If you like those FPS then you'll like this one. Very Realistic Shooter with huge maps and more content on the way according to the news.I don't understand Early Access Reviews. Should be banned.

I am worried however that this EA is a bit too early with finding multiple bugs within the first few seconds of the game.As it seems to be Russian made with a small team, it will most likely be a slow development process. And at it's current level I can see lots of refunds coming, however the price point is indicative of this.4/10 for Early accessin comparrison I gave SQUAD a 6/10 for EAI am reccomending this game purely on price point and the fact it is WW2 and I had some some fun with my 1 hour so far, but was a little frustrating having to run from main as I couldn't work out how to spawn anywhere else."

However, there seems to be a trend of late with early access games being 'unplayable' on release. I expect at least to be able to play the basics without problems.Hellion and Fog of war are 2 recent early access titles I've bought and both at this stage are unplayable for me. I bought Fog of War as an alternative to Heroes & Generals which I've been playing for over 2 years now.Firstly, I'm left handed (Yes Devs, there are quite a few of us out there!) and I'm unable to remap the arrow keys for movement. This is a huge omission on the part of the devs and one that they need to correct asap. So I finally set up the keys which is really awkward without being able to map the arrow keys for movement. I find one server! It has 2 players on it! I spawn in and at least framerates are good. I start to head for the objective and then stop to look around. Ok, I'm not moving but the 'run' animation is still there!? Cant raise my weapon, can't do anything because my guy is running on the spot even when crouched!...lol! I exit the game and spawn in again...same again! The highest resolution I was able to select in game was 1920x1080 but my monitor is 2560x1440! All basic stuff that should have been sorted before release. Spelling mistakes in the UI and however many times I selected English for the language it reverted back to Russian.Early access seems to be an increasing trend but Devs ffs please make sure the basics are working before you release in any shape or form.

The game has a good concept and definitley shows potential, but right now it's in too early of development in my opinion. The game seems a little unstable and its kind of hard to tell who is who from a distance. It's hard to get any kills if your ping is above about 120. I would definitely check this game out again after it's had more work done to it."
76561197999494448,Recommended,574080,30122294,Posted: 23 February,all,Paratrooper82,"What is ""Fog of War""? Fog of War is a first person multiplayer shooter in a WWII Eastern Front setting. It sort of reminds me of the old Red Orchestra where you had large scale battles over a large map, fighting over control points and setting up new spawn bases.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77sM9cdDFUYAt the same time Fog of War has similarities to the game ""Squad"", in terms of vehicle combat, class and squad systems, control points and setting up temporary spawn points for your team.One HUGE pro is the fact that you can serve in a rifle squad or a support unit like a Mortar Team, a Tank team, or an anti-tank gun crew. This is almost revolutionary and amazing!Now here is my big problem with this game, though still in early access, it seems to have significant lags, horrible gun play/gun mechanics at the moment. I mean you can unload an entire magazine with a Stg44 on someone, only for him to kill you with a carabiner rifle. LoL I understand the game is in early access, but the lags and bugs run so rampant that it is almost hilarious trying to play this game at the moment.The community is a mix between helpful teamplayers to complete *****...I still really have high hopes for this game. If they fix the issues, lags and bugs and generally improve the game, this could be a very good WWII tactical shooter.Right now I rate the game 5/10, because they need to work on fixing the issues at hand, and the game has huge potential."

,Not Recommended,574080,33166277,Posted: 2 July,all,Walderschmidt,"Graphically, this game is pleasant to look at. But that's where the good part ends.This game is a buggy, unplayable mess in its current set up, with rather strange controls to someone who is familiar with a variety of shooters, having played casual up to mil sim in the last 10 years.I bought this when it first came and and tried it again today. It feels more buggy now then when I started.Maybe I'll try it again in a year."
,Not Recommended,574080,30358935,Posted: 6 March,all,Shoeby,"Bolt-action rifles completely underwhelming and underclassed by assault weapons not because they're not effective at long range, which they are, it's because they're the most trash thing in close quarters. Now you're probably saying to yourself that's a no brainer, why would they be. I'll tell you why. The standard of killing someone now is 2-3 shots from a bolt-action rifle. Being that all the obectives ever are close quarter compounds, train yards, or apartments, you just get destroyed by SMGs, every time. You'll never get that lucky hip fire unless your enemy misses every shot, or you just happen to hit him in the head or he's just convientantly at low health. Most games it's a standard to have bolt action rifles be very lethal yet cumbersome. It's really hard to do that when I can single fire people with the PPSh from 150 meters.PS; no one ever in this game buys anything other than tanks. Every game is just a grind till someone gets a tank and steamrolls the other team."

,Not Recommended,574080,30231228,Posted: 27 February,all,Snappedfir,"I was really hoping for this game to be good the trailer looked nice and I was pretty excited when I downloaded the game. Now I'm really sad to say that in the 30 mins that I played the game it just did not live up to what I saw in the trailer. One example I can think of is that my buddy and I wanted to play as a mortar crew. Now we ended up getting the points for it but for some reason a solo player took over one of the roles and didnt even know how to use the mortar itself rendering that whole mortar useless. Another con about this game is the weird coloring/filter on the maps. In a game like RO2 they made it to where you can make out distinct differences in uniforms such as colors, coats, hats, and helmets. In this game with the weird filter you cannot make out any distinct color of the uniforms resulting in TONS of friendly fire. To add on to that after a certain distance it seems that everyone turns into shadow men thus again not being able to make out wether or not that guy is an enemy or not. My final con about this game is the connection issue. In a ""NA"" server I get over 160 ping resulting in bullet delay and rubber banding although im sure this issue will be sorted out quickly.Overall I think after a lot of updating and work by the developers (who seem pretty active) this could truely become a great game. I will be refunding this game and will return to a hopefully fantastic game."
