I've always been interested in Slavic folklore and this scratched my itch. Beautiful art, animation, and music, as well as fascinating, albeit poorly translated (it kind of added to it in my opinion though) myths. The puzzles can be a bit tedious, but none of them bothered me too much. There were two tracks that were particularly ear-grating, so you'll want to turn down your volume in those areas. Other than that, well done. If you're interested in Slavic folklore, which was extensively featured in The Witcher series, you'll want to check this out.PROS+Short and sweet---this one won't take up too much of your time+Beautiful art and music+Great soundtrack+Atmospheric and spooky+Fascinating Slavic myths and legendsCONS-Short---even though I think it's worth 6 bucks, the 2 hour length might not justify it for some people-Somewhat tedious puzzles-Slow movement speed (this got a bit annoying in some areas)-Extensive translation errors, though it didn't bother me too much"

Mooseman is a tale of discovery and ritual, as you travel down into the underworld and climb your way back up, and perhaps more importantly, you learn why, and who. And it is gorgeous. The art seems drawn with charcoal, the music is provided by choirs, and good lord, it works for me. The finno-ugric mythology is a joy to learn while providing clues how to progress. Mind you, this is a game about exploration, and linear at that... and yet, having completed it, I find myself wanting, eager to solve the riddles I noticed but looked over, to dive in again, to once more walk that path. Perhaps, hah, perhaps in a week's time."
,Not Recommended,574310,31827920,Posted: 18 May,all,Kita-Jin,"This is a rather pretty looking exploration of a Sápmi myth, and it's quite atmospheric with some great music that is very fitting for the setting, but sadly this is a boring game. The story of the game is told mostly through lore-collectibles that unlock somewhat poorly written text (at least in the English translation) that's accessed through plain-looking menues, and through text-cutscenes; the main story is actually told in the lore-collectibles before you reach it in the actual story progression, which takes away the value of the narrative of the game, since you already know it by the time you reach it.The game tries to be atmospheric, by having a slow movement speed, which is suitable for the sensation and the myth that it is trying to deliver, but the controls of the game are quite bad, and often lead to repeating puzzles as you fail, and the slow movement it is then less atmospheric and more frustrating. It would have been less infuriating if the puzzles weren't for the most instant kill on most occations, requiring you to repeat the same sequence again, with the same poor controls.I had great hopes for this game, but they all fell short. The delivery of the narrative is uninspired; the myths, culture, and stories of the Sápmi people are told in such a grueling way that it soon leaves you not bothering to read more of it. And the game is extremely short, clocking in at around 90 minutes, and that was with several repeats of sections as the miserable controls made things more difficult than they should be."

But i have found screenshots of this game are promising, so i have decided to give a try.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=866912161The gameplay of this game is new for me, but i think this idea is already used somewhere. You control a man who can move beetween two dimensions : the real world and the world of spirits. So when you find obstacles which cannot let you move forward you must move your character to another dimension. I have found gameplay of this game is simple and relaxing.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=866912481The main story of this game is based on myths of one nation in Syberia.While i was playing i didn't pay attention at the story, because it was a liitle bit unclear for me.Everything fell into place at the end of the game. I have realized the real meaning of this story. And it was awesome.The main value of the game is art design. The Mooseman has really beautiful views. I haven't seen repeated locations in the game. Everything was unique.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=866911879The game is short. It is good for people who value their time. I have passed this game for 1.3 hours.This game is like an exciting movie.I recommend ""The Mooseman"" for everyone. Enjoy!"

When we found out the full version had come out, we were very excited.Played this one, and we were speechless at the end. Absolutely beautiful game, stellar atmosphere through the splendid art and soundtrack. The story was engaging and exciting, while still holding room for fun mechanics and a perfect balance of difficulty.I absolutely adore ancient myth and theology, and I think that this game did a perfect job of representing such cultural aspects without appearing gimmicky.I found the addition of the idols to somewhat distract from the primary narrative, but they were still fun to find when you stumbled across them. Just didn't like having to search the same areas for them over and over.Loved the game. Huge respect to the dev team, HUGE respect to the artists, huge respect to anyone involved in this masterpiece. Worth way more than the 9ish bucks I paid for it. Recommending to my friends without a doubt."

Beautiful imagery coupled with simple gameplay make this an extremely enjoyable experience. The fact that this game is based off of real beliefs and the devs used historical documents to put this together really shines through, without making it seem like a history lesson."

It has a strong visual art style, amazing music and introduces the player to myths and legends of another culture. The work put into it can be seen in the Extras (buy those too, you’ll get the music and lots of great art) and makes you appreciate the love placed on this work.If I had to place it in a pre-existing game style it’s more of a walking simulator… you are retracing the path of a mythic hero, so it’s all about the wonder of his path among the three worlds, the sight and sounds, the perils and the purpose of this pilgrimage. I really love it."
,Recommended,574310,30293060,Posted: 3 March,all,Tannerdark3,"This was a short yet beautifully crafted game that I wish more people knew about. The game, while lacking action that many people seek out, had an amazing atmosphere paralleled by the stunning soundtrack and artstyle to create a very unique feeling at least for me. The few puzzles were not hard, but they didn't need to be for this type of game, if the puzzles were hard it would break the immersion the game captures so well. The way the lore is delivered makes for an interesting read to help progress the story the game is telling. Overall I love the game for what it is and I would recommend it to people who enjoy these type of games. I wish I saw more of the beautiful areas I was shown and that I could walk a tad faster, but it isn't needed just something I personally would've liked. Great job on the game from the team who made it, hope to see future titles!"
,Recommended,574310,34016994,Posted: 4 August,all,Solearis,"The Mooseman is an atmospheric side scrolling almost religious experience. I am somewhat hesitant to call it a game, as this label lessens the depth of what the authors tried to achieve.The core game loop consists of progressing through various natural and supernatural environments, with some mild puzzle solving along the way. As you proceed through the very strongly stylized environments, the core takeaway of this experience is revealed to you: the myths and believes of people native to the area of today’s Perm. Don’t be alarmed, there is no preaching here. As far as I am concerned this is an excellent non-intrusive way of preservation of days past of nations vanishing from the present. A decent amount of lore is supplemented with visual story telling. While the experience is rather short clocking in just above two hours, it is instantly memorable and best of all sparks your interest. Luckily the Internet is here to help you. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself reading up on the various tribes and historical events. I know I did. I firmly believe the authors can be proud of that. Now when the Komi, the Mansi people or Anbur is mentioned, those who partook in the experience will immediately recognize these.A very distinctive feel of The Mooseman is amplified by the excellent use of ambient sounds and thematically appropriate music, in key moments amplified by an elated choir. The composer managed to very accurately supplement the visual style of the experience, which in turn is distilled from the various historical artifacts from the area. The way historical artifacts are obtained and presented is one of the few items that fall squarely into the “gaming” category, as the player needs to unlock each artifact by finding it’s hiding spot within the world. Contrary to this, the entirety of the lore is accessible from the start. The catch is that all of it is written in Anbur, an Old Permian Script. Each snippet is only translated to your language, once a certain totem is reached on your journey. I must commend the authors for taking the flow of the experience into account and making some of the puzzles optional. While enhancing the game aspects of the piece, I feel it would have considerably detracted from the experience.Overall, I have a single minor quality of life level complaint. Artifacts and lore are presented in a paginated list of items that resets to the first page after a stage transition is performed. This is truly a minor point, as both categories only have several pages.I would recommend The Mooseman to those who enjoy focused audio-visual narrative experiences. Especially considering the price of admission, as 9 whatevers nets you the soundtrack and a comprehensive art book."
,Recommended,574310,29991982,Posted: 17 February,all,Quay (b-day in 2 days),"Took my breath away. This game has a very pagan/Tribal feel to it. Being based on Komi and  finno-ugric culture. The artwork and soundtrack are utterly breathless, while the rich immersement into the story will leave you in awe and wonderance of reality. The gameplay is fun but challenging, and will want you to continue on until the game is done. Would reccomend this game to anyone interested in shamanistic culture."

The story is based on myth too, and all visuals and music greatly inspired with beliefs of those ancient northern people. While there is not that challenging as somebody would expect looking at Limbo-like screenshots, and you actually need about 3 hours to complete whole game, this is still very strong impression, and really leaves great afterglow. The closest thing to compare IMHO would be Oknytt game (which is also great and myth-based)."

76561198091197472,Recommended,574310,30287916,Posted: 2 March,all,Jtaylor18,"NOT FOR EVERYONE, BUT BEAUTIFUL IN STYLESo I originally bought this game based off its visual presentation, and in that regard it did not disappoint. The game is very fun to look at through its entire narrative. However I found some of the other elements to be disappointing. Overall I enjoyed my time in the game but bellow ill list some issues that might be deal breakers for others, in hope that it can be useful to those who are on the edge about picking up the title.*Questionably Written Lore Entries and Narration.A large part of this game is traveling across its world and collecting Idols and symbols to unlock lore entries about the mythology and culture covered in the game. I am not sure if it's due to poor translation or if the entries are intentionally trying to keep the flow of the culture they came from but many are structured strangely and at times difficult to follow. Id imagine if you have a great interest in old world mythology this probably wouldn't be an issue, but for me I found it hard to keep interest in the entries as the game continued on.*Very Simple GameplayThrough most of The Mooseman you will literally just be walking forward and solving basic puzzles, where the answer is often apparent at first glance. The mechanics of the game are not very engaging or challenging so if you need engaging gameplay to enjoy a game you may end up disappointed. Visually all the bosses, puzzles, and scene transitions were very impressive but mechanically it's all very forgettable.*Old World StoryThe story line of this game is a slow unraveling of ancient pagan myths, and they are not modernized or doctored up for presentation. If you approach the game as a short interactive glimpse into an ancient culture's beliefs this isn't really an issue but if you're expecting a very compelling narrative with character building, twists, or logical consistency you wont find it here. Most religions are not exactly known for their skillful writing, and many things in this story are simply stated as fact without justification and may contradict themselves two entries down the road.All in all I enjoyed my time in The Mooseman and given its reasonable price it was easy to look past its short comings. It offers a short unique experience that is definitely not going to be to everyone's tastes but if you're willing to give it a chance there are some truly stunning visuals along the way."

There isn't gameplay. You hold the right button (or D as per your preference) read some notes on russofinnish paganism (I heard about this and is why I bought the product having predominantly finnish ancestry) and occassionally press the spacebar.It's a neat product for learning somewhat about a 2000 year old dead culture.

It is a slow paced game with a few elegant puzzles that rely on you picking up the cues, no explanation needed. The folklore is well applied, and the graphics are beautiful.It is not a fast paced game, the action is sparse and not the centerpiece, instead it takes you on a limbo-esque folklore journey. The folklore aspect reminded me a bit of never alone, though it is a very different game, but if you liked that particular aspect maybe this is for you too."
