,Not Recommended,574640,33597279,Posted: 16 July,all,Loutishh,One of the worst games I've ever played. Even with the coupon I used to get this game for $0.25 it's still not even worth that price.
76561198123594863,Recommended,574640,29349607,Posted: 18 January,all,Necrolexicon,"Unaliveis arogue like/shooterhybrid in which you run through random rooms shooting spiders and other mutated insect like creatures whilst picking up various items that provide your character with powerful passive upgrades similar toBinding of Isaac. There is a crafting system in place which allows you to collect items like gun powder, nuts and cubes to make ammo, grenades or health packs at the crafting benches scattered throughout the rooms.Unalivehas recently been updated fixing the amount of ammo found throughout the game so that you should never really run out unless you are being very wasteful or have an extremetly unlucky run. I recently finished the game with 5500 ammo left! The music and sound effects are minimal but errie and complement the games lo-fi aesthetic. Overall a fun, well priced budget game for fans of therogue like/shootergenre."

,Recommended,574640,29719695,Posted: 5 February,all,L.A.,Not so bad as described by others. My main issue was the computer A.I. as some enemies kept stacking in the doors. Rest is at quite good level. I like the visual part and the soundtrack. The game is good but it would be even better if the developers improve the A.I.
,Recommended,574640,34689251,Posted: 2 September,all,Error 404 Entoco Not Found,"I got this product with a 90% coupon and i decided to buy it. This game, although might seem trash for the graphics is actually very cool and can make people rage quit as sometimes (especially in the last boss), it can be difficult and you die, leaving all your objects, but it is very worth it to help you pass your time. So i give it a 9/10"
,Recommended,574640,32639116,Posted: 22 June,all,Sharp Income,"Shoot Enemies. Gather Resources. Craft Supplies. Try to Survive...Nice little roguelite/like game. Procedural generation is nice, but the levels are still linear. It's just a different layout each time you'll have to remember (to get back to the crafting table). Nice atmosphere, music is decent and well suited. Simple variety in monsters in their look, HP, attack styles (shoot vs melee) - not a lot but its a simple game. You get a single gun (left click) and mines (right click) - not 'grenades' because you can't throw them which is a bummer (or I'm doing it wrong?). You also pick up random items that give you some sort of boost for your character such as increase critical hit chance, random +/- grenades, + speed, + healing. The store page also mentions traps... I don't know if I've come across any traps or maybe when I randomly get pushed back I'm being hit by a trap? IDK.I thoroughly enjoyed the game as a bite-sized sci-fi rogue adventure simple top down shooter to kill a bit of time with. I don't get all the negative reviews - sure the game could be better, but for what it is, it offers a good chunk of funand rewards you with trading cards ;).suggestions to developer:A melee weapon would still be a nice addition though, and grenades, instead of mines (& increase crafting cost). Also would be nice if some of the crates could be 'opened' instead of having to be shot (or hit with said suggested melee weapon). And would be nice if sometimes you just straight up got ammo/grenades (maybe you do but I didn't come across that yet?) And maybe an additional item(s) you could craft from a different type of work bench - gun upgrades! increase fire-rate -> rapid fire. add a reload mechanic then a few upgrades for increase mag size, increase dmg."

,Recommended,574640,34111149,Posted: 8 August,all,Miraculate,"Almost all the negative reviews for this game were written by incompetent kids. Reading other reviews you will hear complaints about achievements, difficulty, and a lack of warning of whats dangerous.The third complaint listed above is the only reasonable complaint however it can be dismissed with about .5 hours of trial and error. After that time you should have a basic understanding of what is and isnt dangerous.The most common complaint I have seen is that its too difficult to beat the game. Its a perma death rogue-like shooter. Read the tags before you buy a game it will actually end up saving you money if your not looking for a challenging game. Not to mention that after a little trial and error you find that the game is actually quite easy.And the final complaint I have seen is about the achievements. The achievements appear harder to get than they are. Its important to note that each achievement asking you to get a certain number of kills or gather a certain amount of ammo is asking you to do it within a single run so if you die you have to restart. You need to have 1000 bullets in the top left corner of your screen to get the achievement. The rest of the achievements are self explanitory.Ammo boxes are found from breaking boxes and doors. When you first start you should run around and see what your able to break and what your not able to break. Dont worry about ammo you will find much more than you will lose."

,Recommended,574640,34367172,Posted: 20 August,all,Freddols,"I got this game for 25 cents because i had a coupon from a badge i crafted. At that price it was not a bad bargain. The game is pretty decent with slight problems, although i'd love to see it have more features, that i will be talking about in a second.Pros:- Enjoyable, Semi-Hard Gameplay.- Not the best graphics, although very fitting.- Has a ton of In-game Perks throughout the game.Cons:- Very short Gameplay (I finished it for about 76 mins, including the learning curve).- Gameplay is very dull and repeatable.- Not really worth the original 1 dollar price. Maybe if it was half that, i'd still be more worth it.- No other weapons except the default, although Perks make it better.Things i think this game needs:- Longer gameplay, so more Dungeons to go through.- Weapon / Perk Shop throughout the Dungeons (Sort of like the Crafting tables u come across).- Some sort of Multiplayer or Online Co-Op (I think this game is perfect for that. Go through the dungeons with a buddy. This would increase the game difficulty).Overall:Now, i know that this game is supposed to be short and simple, but if the game is going to keep that shape, it better down the price a little (i'd price it at 45 cents).Im recommending this game only because there is a specific group of people who are on the look for Small Games like these. If u are that type of person / gamer, i think u should try it out if u don't mind paying a dollar for it.Overall, the game is really not that bad. I had quite a lot of fun while it lasted.Good luck to the devs!"
