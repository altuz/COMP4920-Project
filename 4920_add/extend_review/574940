,Not Recommended,574940,30953770,Posted: 4 April,all,Gamblore,"Single player story is pretty cool, but it is very short. There seems to be a lack of story. A little voice over the radio telling me about the situation would have improved this so much."

I expected some decent VR space game and got a great atmospheric short story with very good gameplay and space feeling.Game is very short, so look out maybe for a bargain. I got it myself in a cheap bundle and have to say it is totally worth the price for me of the bundle in general.I can't wait for the story to continue. There was in this 20 minutes more or at least the same atmoshpere like in recent Space Games à la Prey, Dead Space or Alien Isolation, etc.Especially the end blows you away.I did not have any nausea or crashes of the game.Recommended short story."

76561198341476147,Not Recommended,574940,30942226,Posted: 4 April,all,Lexx,"I bought this for the zero G mechanic and to experience the earth from a space station, but it's been severely watered down (there is no transfer of kinetic energy to angular velocity when you touch something - you just stop!) and they have annoying flaps on each side (helmet I suppose) which restrict peripheral vision.The FoV is already insufficient on the first gen HMDs and the last thing I want is a further reduction.I understand some people may need this to avoid motion sickness, but there should be a non-hobbled option for those who wish to experience a realistic zero G experience, in which one rotates when touching or throwing things, and which may cause the player to float upside down.I'll most likely be refunding this one unless I find some redeeming quality that makes it more than just another rails shooter."

,Recommended,574940,33074119,Posted: 1 July,all,RC-1290,"A fun short demonstration of movement and interaction in a micro-g environment. I would not have picked it up for the full price, but it's definitely worth checking out now that it's 90% off.I was surprised how much I could float around without triggering some form of simulation sickness. Exceptions to that being cases where the game brings you too close to the floor (your character is horizontal, even if you're standing, in some cases it might be better to play crouched down). I occasionally also feel disoriented when I walk around while I'm floating, so I recommend stopping your flight before moving your head a lot (In future versions of the game, they should probably detect head movement beyond a threshold, and stop your floating movement at that point).The game uses a fancy Inverse Kinematics rig to give you a body in the game world, which is pretty neat when you play with a friend. Combined with the effect applied to your friend's voice when they talk to you over the in-game radio, it results quite an immersive experience.Those Inverse Kinematics also get in the way a bit unfortunately. Objects you hold are not tracked directly to your controller (I would prefer this in future versions). The in-game hands try to follow your controller as closely as possible, and due to some issues with the shoulder placement in the current version, that be off by quite a bit, so you can't rely on muscle memory or slight adjustments in your grip while shooting."

But I got it for 0,99€ in the summer sale.So grab it at sale, great 20 minutes! Do not buy it at full price, its not worth 10 €."
76561198063942102,Recommended,574940,32720590,Posted: 24 June,all,PS5Owner,Not a game.  just a polished zero g experience.really feels like youre floating around in a space suit.There's about 4 different environments to mess around with.  Has virtual arms and good interactions.  Nice presence in this demo.One of my favorite environments to just hang out in while listening to youtube.
76561197972025376,Recommended,574940,33160956,Posted: 2 July,all,justintd,It's worth the 99 cent sale price but not much more due to length. Get Detached if you want zero G.
,Recommended,574940,33332165,Posted: 6 July,all,pittsburghjoe,"Worth the price, when on sale. I haven't tried multiplayer yet. I get sim sick somewhat easily, but didn't this time, the dev's must have fixed it (after reading other peoples reviews)"

76561198016307146,Recommended,574940,30866768,Posted: 31 March,all,ClutchRocketship,"Loved this game/demo....HUGE potential!!  I love seeing new ideas and experiments brought to the VR table and don't mind paying a few bucks for a totally different experience.  If it's done poorly then yeah, it should be free but when it's done well...I don't think $10 is asking too much. Especially if it goes toward a full version of the game.Regardless...I hope this gets expanded on and becomes a much longer experience."
76561197970805976,Recommended,574940,30927079,Posted: 3 April,all,Prince of Presence,"The graphics are amazing. AAA quality. Although the single player campaign is short, it is a fun way of getting used to the locomotion which is amazing. The real star of the show is the deathmatch! I logged in during a ""play with devs"" session organized on the steam community forum, and it was pretty intense. The zero G mechanic creates a whole new style of mulitplayer deathmatch and I think it's amazing and really well suited for VR. Getting kills and getting killed in zero G feels really epic, and it's fun how you can shield yourself from incoming shots using space debris.If you want to play multiplayer then be sure to add me as a steam friend. I'll be down to play anytime so we can build up this community.Also keep an eye on the community forum for scheduled matches with the devs."

76561197984435867,Recommended,574940,30864103,Posted: 31 March,all,[RIP] XXLpeanuts,"I think people are being a bit too critical of this, as a pure tech demo, for what I hope to be an eventual complete game (cut them some slack guys, there are no AAA studios making games like this yet) it is fantastic.The movement is great, but I am fully comfortable with Onward style movement, this feels as natural as that if not more so because you are floating and dragging yourself.The environment is stunning, physics spot on, and while terribly short story experience, is has coop to fool around in zero g with a buddy (first game to have that I believe) and a deathmatch mode which would be good if anyone played, actually it would be amazing, 8 people vs apparently, so think shattered horizon but in VR, yes please. I bet it could be awesome but noone is online waiting for a game as of day one.TLDR: For the price, I feel its completely worth it if only to float about in a space station, with a really nice and unique movement method that felt 100% natural. The fact it has Coop and MP deathmatch make it a must have.**UPDATE** Having played the deathmatch now, I can seriously say this is a fantastic game, and a very justified price concidering the content and replayability of the deathmatch. I also have a video up if you want to see us play, also features a developer giving us some insight on the game itself.https://youtu.be/ChoOfGwJ5X4"
,Recommended,574940,30867696,Posted: 31 March,all,Bygrace,"I have spent an hour in the game only playing deathmatch. The game has a great atmosphere and has a lot potential. The story mode is short, but the game environments are beautiful. This is a great buy for 10 dollars if you have some buds to play coop/deathmatch with after you beat the story. This game feels like a fully fleshed out game that will be fantastic after a few content updates."
76561198355642537,Recommended,574940,30882549,Posted: 1 April,all,Wurlman12,I loved the game but for the price even for a progogue was to short. As i just got used to the controls the game was over. But the consept and controls are great. I personaly recomend not buying till the price goes down to a 3 or 4 $ price range
,Recommended,574940,30875558,Posted: 1 April,all,Kris.vdv,"Played it till the end and here's my review:pro- I love the general concept and story a lot!- visually very good, I love the colors, textures are really good, everything looks great- atmospheric lights and sound, I like it- very smooth, runs excellent with high framerate -> zero nausea!- love the idea of flinging- love the minimal music you sometimes herecons-  flinging should me made a bit easier!  Could be that I'm clumsy, but I'd love the fling mechanism to be a little less hard-  like many VR games/prologues,  it's (very) short.  A better price would have been 4.99 or something like that.Bottomline :  I can't wait to play the full game!"
,Recommended,574940,31068705,Posted: 10 April,all,DoomShifter,really fun coop-just a little short
,Recommended,574940,35035211,Posted: 17 September,all,Game Cooker US Rocks VR,A rare cheap VR experience that is actually enjoyable.This short experience is well worth the ride for a cheap price. It is a Prologue so don't expect a full game. It is just an intro to what is coming. It does have co-op and MP if that is your peeve. I liked the SP so no need for MP for me. Short but very sweet. It is well logical to support the devs for the upcoming episodic game. They just changed the price to $2 it seems. I just bought it for $2.50 but that is ok. I am not refunding at all since I had such a nice time.Here is a video of my first live stream play:https://youtu.be/sX39ZXkPCRs

76561197963327589,Recommended,574940,34500214,Posted: 26 August,all,Obfuscator,"This is a pretty nice showcase for the potential of zero-G games in VR. The grab-and-push movement mechanics are somewhat unique and pretty intuitive (but might trigger slight motion sickness if you're sensitive to it, I'm not). Even though it's set in outer space, there's a pretty noticeable atmosphere (haha). You get this creepy ""what happened here"" vibe, and then you find weapons and think ""this might get hairy"". The enemies are a little uninspired, and are not really a big part of this demo. It's very short, but I think one or two dollars isn't that much to ask for a brief yet polished experience."
