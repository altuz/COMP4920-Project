Well because the Devs for this game actually give a damn about the fans, left a comment, and nullified all my complaints in one fell swoop. My initial positive review was, in short, about how well written this game was. I wasn't much a fan of the voice acting, but that's really more of a personal opinion than a game flaw. My negative review followed close behind 'cuz I replayed the game a bunch and found the choices lacking in terms of impact, I felt like my hands were tied in only getting the ideal ending that the devs had mapped out. Well, I was wrong, sorta'. According to top-secret documents for which I must now burn, the Devs have a remedy to my complaints waiting in the wings.In short, buy it. 'Cuz Elves.Also because the Devs are pretty cool."

After waking up from a play session of Celestial Crossing one day, he discovers his female elf warlock raiding partner in Celestial Crossing Nerith is suddenly right in his room at his apartment. While trying to help Nerith return to her world in Celestial Crossing, Nerith reveals to Hikaru that his only friend Mika may actually be attracted to him.The game has its share of humour and fanservice. Although there are no achievements at the time of this review, the developer announced achievements will be added at some point in the future with trading cards already being released. Recommended when at discount or in bundle offer as it takes less than 10 hours to read through the storyline and dialogue and reach 4 possible endings."
,Not Recommended,575010,32262427,Posted: 8 June,all,Azura Squifflepants,"There's a short VN and then there's one which takes 28 minutes for a playthrough. This is the latter. It's a shame because there's lots of talent on display here. The art is good, the voice work (about from the strange ladyboy playing the elf) is good, the writing's not bad and the story has a ton of potential but sadly, it goes unrealized. It's like the devs ran out of money after making the first 1/10th of a story and went ""stuff it - we can finish like they did at school -with then they all woke up."" Which is pretty much exactly what happened here.Would be interested if this team ever actually releases something full length but this is pretty meagre value even on sale. Thumbs down."
,Recommended,575010,28969312,Posted: 3 January,all,IlleniumBound,"First let me detail that I'm not a huge VN player, though what few ones I have played have been quite enjoyable, so I like to think that I can tell the difference between one that is worth playing, and one that is not.With that said, the reason why this particular VN attracted my attention was because of the unique story concept, Literally, the first thing that hooked my attention was; ""Would you get along with your game character?"" When I first saw that, I humored to investigate the game, read some reviews and see the media files covering bits of it to get a taste for the artwork. After that, I was sold to give it a try, especially considering it was on sale.First thing I'd like to compliment toward is that the game went for fully voiced dialogue (save the protagonist, which of course is obvious why they wouldn't). I get that a lot of instances people prefer to imagine the voice of characters for themselves in visual novels, to create the story for themselves. Other cases say that the voice acting in this game wasn't very impressive, which I could understand, it wasn't Disney-quality audio, but it was definitely better than a lot of others I've heard before, and was well enough that it helped to set a positive mood for the story and it's characters than the alternative of ruining the experience, which has happened before.. The only complaint I could possibly voice on this subject is that part of me felt like the voices sounded very ""hush-hush,"" as though they were trying to use indoor voices. Which is understandable, considering unique circumstances and the possible lack of a studio, but it occasionally took away from the emotion that was to be expected out of certain scenes, such as Nerith raising her voice in frustration. But again, it didn't ruin the experience by any degree, so it's hardly worth faulting the game over. It's more of a personal opinion.On part of the artwork, I personally enjoyed it. It felt familiar; as though I've seen similar, but there was nothing wrong with that. The artstyle worked and was very well done, especially in respect to the scenic (background) images, as well the sprites. I felt the cinematic scenes could have used a little more work in some cases, but never so much so that it was ever disastifying to look at.As for the soundtrack, I loved it! Though there didn't feel to be very much variety of individual songs, that was hardly a problem considering that most of what was used worked very well for different scenes. I'm specifically a fan of the main menu theme, as it does well to set the feeling of fantasy elements, even though the beginning of the game is the only time it fully adopts the atmosphere of a fanasy setting.As for the story and the length of the game, I found it to be very pleasant, especially considering typos and grammatical errors were few and far apart. Though I do feel the game was a bit short-lived, which came as a bit of a disappointment when I met the conclusion, I had certainly hoped to have had a lot more involvement in the course of the story. Thus far, I've only been able to find 2 endings, being ""Home"" and ""Next time."" If there are more, I'm not aware of them, yet. Though what I felt to be a short game, it certainly wasn't disatisfying (especially considering the top-secrect information that has been leaked by reliable sources that shan't be named...).Overall: I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who can appreciate a well-written VR with pleasantly above average attributes. 8/10Nerith is 10/10wouldromance though, just saying..."
76561198145570247,Not Recommended,575010,30075257,Posted: 21 February,all,SSDkoChan,"6/10Okay, so, I've played 89 minutes of the game and managed to get all 4 endings without a guide (I don't think making one is even worth it). The game is really short and didn't manage to immerse me at all. There weren't many choices to make, which is understandable considering the length, but a lot of them are arbitrary and dont impact the story at all. After playing through two endings I figured out that there are only two or three choices that change the ending.The voice acting was really irritating to me, especially because of the few japanese words put in just to make it more japanese. If I'm being really blunt, it's weeb♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's kind of cringy, having english speaking and english sounding VA's saying ""Kami-sama"" and ""kun"" and ""chan"". However, I will give them credit for having voice acting in the first place; not a lot of VN's go for it.If there's one thing I'm going to praise it's the art; It was better than a lot of cheap VN's. Even though the art is good, however, theres not much use for it. While this game does have the nudity tag, it's not at all an erotic game. If you expect some kind of erotic story or even just a few erotic scenes, you're not going to get anything from this game. A lot of it is just alot of easy to spot attempts at forced sex appeal.Overall I'm only mildly disappointed. The first playthrough was quick but not awful. I did find myself growing fond of one of the main characters: Nerith. Maybe if the game had gone on longer, I'd have more of a chance to attach myself emotionally to the characters; and maybe they'd have the chance to tell a deeper story and sprinkle in a few ero scenes."

76561197970369027,Recommended,575010,29166842,Posted: 10 January,all,Omega Red,"Not a terribly long game with a nice premise that I think we have all thought about happening before.The voice acting of the main character you interact with grates after a while but the story itself is fun. At times you are given choices in how to interact with certain characters but there are few and far between. As a whole it is a nice little time waster with some good ideas and a great art style. At just over an hour to complete a run through I am not sure if it's price tag is justifies but perhaps there will be new content released in future to add longevity.Don't let the 'nudity' tag fool you, it is not as adult and crass as you might think.Worth a shot if you can grab it in the sale and you enjoy this style of game"

,Recommended,575010,30385309,Posted: 7 March,all,8th | Cоsмоиaцт ☭,"If you were expecting something with nudity, mature content, or branching romance paths, this isn't what you're looking for. Semi-misleading tags and pictures aside, It's a nice little VN with a cool premise. It is on the very short side however, and seems overpriced for the amount of content that it offers.The voice acting, while appreciated, can be a bit cringy at times. This is most notable when the voice actors are pronouncing japanese words which just seem haphazardly thrown in because 'muh animuu'. It just doesn't fit perhaps as well as the devs envisioned.I will say that the art is phenominal, and was the primary drive for my purchase of the game in the first place. Though I wish there was an easier way of finding out who did it, because the only way I can currently find out is by completing the game and getting to the credits.The characters seem likeable, though due to it's length, I felt I didn't learn about them as much as I would have liked. Would have loved to see more content. That, combined with a lot of missed opportunities for character development and dialouge, is what kinda irritates me about this title.Regardless, I enjoyed my time with it and was a bid sad with it's abrupt conclusion. It is a nice game, if overpriced. The sweet story and fantastic art are the pillars that hold this game up. This is a great base for this studio to build on, and it's one that I really hope they do. A tentative yes from me."

Rather short and compact, the story has four endings (that have been found at least), and involves you suddenly meeting one of your MMORPG avatars... in a rather strange way. Anyway, you then have to navigate life with a seriously annoyed elf warlock that wants to go back to her home... and also deal with any fallout of her sudden appearance. Can you handle it?"
76561197993928733,Recommended,575010,29839946,Posted: 10 February,all,Cool_Flying,"So I've never really written reviews on games before, mostly becasue i'm too busy playing them. But I would like to give my thoughts on this game. For starters, it is fair to say that this game was a bit too short for my liking. I would like to see more content from a game like this, because it's one of those where you enjoy the story so much you hate that it ends so quickly. Perhaps there is possibilty for future DLC for this game, like maybe a route for Nerith were you go through the door with her and are in the game as well. I would pay for DLC that juicy. Honestly whatever it could potentially be if it ever happens, I just want a Nerith route. Other than that, this game was very enjoyable. I always enjoy a slew of choices, because it makes me feel more engaged in what is essentially a story. Often times I find myslef reading great stories with great characters, but the few choices I come across disappoint me. The voice acting was great, I thought it really brought even more life into the characters. Overall, I believe Celestial Crossing is a must play, and while the DLC that I and others hope may come most likely won't, I look forward to your future games, and I can guarantee you I will buy all of them.This has been a Cool_Flying review for a fly and cool game."

Still haven't finished it, and honestly, I am going to jump into some better VNs and leave this one until I have nothing left to play.Update: Okay, so I finished it. Writing it terrible, I powered through to the so-called endings, each of which were profoundly disappointing.Bee tee dubs, if you think there is a route where you can romance the elf, you're wrong. This is a single story game, that barely changes depending on route. Worst off, the achievements for this game didn't even unlock, despite going through it multiple times.Voice acting is also sub-par, Nerith's VO needed a pop-filter on her microphone when reading these lines.This game is trash. Not worth buying even if it is on sale."

If I'd been focusing entirely on the game I could have finished my first route within fifty minutes and every other route in another five. There just isn't anything /here/, even if what they provide is enjoyable.But consider that there's all of three full images, no image viewer, no route viewer, and the VN's are embarassing to listen too. I tend to value my hour at more than what this game costs. Two hours? Woulda been worth it."

76561198297188564,Recommended,575010,28939383,Posted: 2 January,all,WillowD,"I'm glad I bought this game. I love the story. It has excellent background music. They hired voice actors to speak the dialog. Did I mention I love the story? I really, REALLY love the story. And I really like and identify with all three main characters.On the down side, I finished the game in 2 hours. I got ending #1, which ended the way I wanted it to, where he gets a girlfriend and a best friend. And since there are no steam awards I have no idea if there are alternate endings. I'm not going to bother finding out. (Note: Another review says there are alternate endings.) The voice acting was merely adequate rather than good but they are way, WAY better than not having voice actors so I still consider the voice acting a BIG plus.The big down side is price. I have purchased a number of other multiple choice visual novels for about 1/3 the cost that I enjoyed just as much and that gave me a lot more than 2 hours of game play. If there is only one ending then this is a very pricey game in terms of dollars per hour of game play. Despite this one big flaw I am still recommending it. The game IS that good.Note: Another review said the developers are planning to release a significant update to the story. I'm looking forward to playing it."

She's still not short though.  As can be expected given the premise there is a whole lot of awkward (which includes very non-Japanese voices using Japanese affectations), but if one can get past that there is a lot (a little) to enjoy (because the game's short).  I found the voice acting charming despite some weirdness.  The art was rather pleasant.  The story bumbled around a bit but that was entirely appropriate given its circumstances.  Our time together was brief, but I found myself rather attached to the characters by the end.  I hope things go well for them.Despite its brevity, this game is an easy recommend, especially to anyone who has put long hours into MMOs (where the brevity may be a plus), especially on sale."

,Recommended,575010,30489852,Posted: 13 March,all,スブ,"First impressions: for a game that costs 6 dollars and has some voice acting. Yea, it is pretty decent.Voice acting is ok, not super high quality.Art is good, but it won't make the game.Background music and art is generic. It is like slide-show presentation quality.Text, well, decent and easy to read. Just minor pet peeves with the immersion breakers.For VN standards this is ok in my books, but this could have been worse.Pacing with the text and voice acting is great. I would have dropped this game instant if it would only have been ""only text with pretty art"". I think every girl has good voice actress, but you can clearly hear that some of their dialogue are recorded in basement or in their rooms.Girls design look something I would want to see more of, they are simple and easy to recognize. I think that was most where they put effort on and that shows.My own biggest problem is those ""-san, -kun, -chan"" ends. It does not work in ENGLISH! Out of context it makes characters sounds like biggest anime fans they can be, but in story they don't show any slight interrest in anime. It would be ok if they spoke like normal humans and not japanese wannabes. It breaks the flow, when someone adds it. I really love these voice actresses, but when they forcefully add that ""-kun"" or ""-san"" I cringe little inside.Because do you think normal people in america add those? Make dialogue more fluid and human. Like if they would actual say something to each other.Overall I think I this review more towards to devs and actual bame buyer, but hey.To you, who are thinking, should you buy this game?Yes: If it is on sale under 4 dollars, it is worth that much. You are pretty much paying for audio book than VN. Or you like VN with voice acting and want to support devs to challenge themselves to make a more grandier game with better quality and spot fixing these little ""things"".No: If you don't like that anime style, like, this whole game is very unoriginal. Idea is great, but like, if you want to just enjoy VN with like actually believable story, skip this. Not worth of your money. You would rather watch Anime or play something else.BUT, would I recommend this game to someone. YES. As a study game. Let them see, how you can make a decent game that is enjoyable to play, but has too many minor nitpicks that crushes your suspension of disbelief. But I hope, if devs gets something out of this and makes a improved game in the future. I would be happy."

Second, it is REALLY short: it looks like I have done everything this game has to offer in about 2 hours.  I'm going to have to leave this game on to get the trading cards it has.  Other than that, it does have voice acting, which I wasn't expecting, and it was a pretty fun experience.

The entire game runs about 2-3 hours per playthrough and there are only 4 endings, none of which invovle getting together with the warlock. The characters are mostly bland rehashes such as the  beta nerd made intentionally bland so you can pretend to be him, a childhood friend that loves him despite him having zero desireable qualities and a couple other minor charcters with too few lines to really matter. The only good character is the Warlock, a violent musclehead that cares little for the norms of this world. While her character is good enough to make the VN entertaining, a lack of a romance route with this character really dampens the ending.Also the voice acting is cringy but that could just be me."

(Mostly two, since Mika is offensively reduced to being a prize more than a person, typical of the girl-next-door archetype.) The POV character is an unbearable amalgam of NEET stereotypes lifted straight from ""Welcome to the NHK,"" minus the humor and knowing winks to the audience. Runtime is short and replays are unrewarding considering the four (4) endings are left intentionally unsatisfying to allow for a sequel that does not appear to be forthcoming.I regret that my experience - and thus this review - are so negative, as the failings have more to do with the writing's inability to transcend well-worn genre conventions, but if games are meant to be an immersive, interactive art-form then this is the equivalent of a 200 page-count airport novel.
