,Not Recommended,575140,29683931,Posted: 3 February,all,Monsieur-Owly,"I don't know what the positive reviews in Russian are saying but all I know is that, aside from the old-school FPS vibes, Cemetery Warrior 3 has not much to do with the intense and fast-paced Serious Sam and Painkiller. In fact, it is a game plagued by its kinship with mobile and web browsing games. If I'm not mistaken this game has been released few years ago as a freeware.NEGATIVES-Slow character's movement-No jump button-Unexciting gunplay-Lack of visual feedback when hitting or shooting at enemies-Very small combat arenas-Very few ammo box to pickup-Poor visuals-Annoying soundtrackPOSITIVES+1$ price tag+Not made with GameGuru+Smooth framerate+Loading time almost nonexistentConclusion: It is unfortunate that the devs didn't bother doing a remake or remaster for the Steam release since it has some potential. The hellish settings and the nightmarish bestiary show some consistency.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vct4koJ0yV4Rating:2.5 / 10"
,Not Recommended,575140,29722306,Posted: 5 February,all,Aythadis,"This game is not fun to play, even consider it to be painful, and it's got a lot of Ear♥♥♥♥♥♥sounds.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQZghpQHy6wFor the people that don't want to watch the video of me suffering through half of the game:This game is trying to be like Painkiller... but is no where even close! The graphics are not that good. There is even NO option to change graphics. Hell there wasn't even a Unity start up menu (like most Unity games end up using.) The option menu in game is just sound sliders and screen resolution. There is no secrets, you can't interact with anything. Lava does kill you though.The gameplay is simplistic. You move to room to small room, and fighting spawns of monsters/demons, while some Metal is played. Now the movement speed is PAINFULLY slow, and there is no sprint. There is even barely a jump. Most monsters are actually faster than you. Don't get me started on the sounds. Sounds are off, or sounds like they are in a completely different direction, some sounds are even pure ear♥♥♥♥♥♥ Some sounds are even ripped from Doom! Some monsters that I encountered don't even have ANY sounds. When you die there isn't even a sound for that! I was also killed from a monster shooting through a wall.There is also no health/armor pick ups. You only get health when you complete a room and move onto the next area.The weapons are pretty generic, machine gun, shotgun, rocket launcher, there might be another one, but I could not get past the second level. Picking up the weapons don't give you any ammo, and completing a level takes away your weapons, leaving you with the chain melee weapon. The amount of damage done to monsters seems to be random. Sometimes you can kill them in 1-2 shots, other times it takes 6-9 shots. You also don't take damge from your own rockets.The only good thing I can find is the music... sometimes. Out of the 5 songs there is, 3 of them are actually good! (If someone know where I can find the music or how I can rip files out of Unity, please let me know.) The other 2 are horrible loops. This game ALSO has the issue of the music will just randomly get louder in certain rooms, or when you go to the next level, or when you die and restart... and I mean REALLY LOUD! And it's usually the sh*tty loops that end up being really loud.After my horrible and not fun play and not able to make it to the second boss, I checked out the game files in hopes I could steal the music to listen to... The game is only 115 MB. AND according to the files, there is only 4 maps!The game also crashed when I died and tried to go back to the menu.EDIT: I card farmed the game to get the 3 Steam Cards. The first two dropped in about 1 hour... but the last card took ALMOST 4 HOURS!!Pros:- Metal Music- No Achievements (No need to play through the entire game)- Steam Traiding CardsCons:- Horrible Graphics- Horrible Sounds- Some Music is horrible- Damage isn't consistant- No health pick ups- Small boring rooms- You are slow as sh*t- Only 4 levelsNo. Just no. It's not worth the $1."

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byW0NlqC0ZEA truly desperate attempt to make a quick dollar, and a desperate purchase for an FPS shooter with sooo many much better FPS games on Steam now.Let me give you a few of the many reasons to avoid this..- No health packs, no armor, nothing to pick up except weapons and ammo.- No sprint button, no blocking, no dodging, just mindless spamming/holding M1 to win.- Mindless action, gets very repetitive very quickly.- No score, No healing, No Co-op or Online modes.- Horrid collision detection, Minimal monster animation, non existent AI, and laughable and lame rag-doll physics.- Looks, plays, and feels like a game put together in Game Guru or the Unity engine in about 3 hours time max,- Just a quick cash grab through and through, though some people might feel it's worth the low price tag."

,Not Recommended,575140,29754512,Posted: 6 February,all,carrieshot ♣™,"I can't say this game is very good for how fast you swing, the second level is just patience, like most people would die alot there without learning the technic, if there was more work put into the game, like creating a remaster of it, then I would see it doing well, but why port it over instead of trying to work on it. I just don't understand why this game actually got released in the first place."

76561198045314216,Not Recommended,575140,29884409,Posted: 12 February,all,-=Dungeonjay=-,"Cemetary Warrior 3 initially looked like a good grab.  I watched the developers on their last couple games and they did halfway decent on them.  Thought maybe they would be beginning to polish some of their experiences and unfortunately they haven't gotten there yet.  The hitboxes are off, AI movement isn't polished and you can't rebind the keys.  I can even forgive the no native 1080p support as this is a cheap under dollar title.  Overall, I wasn't really convinced to give this game a positive review as it just lacks that umph to push it over the thumbs up threshold.  Hopefully, they will go back to the drawing board and spend some more time on these types of games because they got the basic idea down and a little more motivation and they could be hitting the market with decent cheap indie titles.....Here is my recap first look:https://youtu.be/0iNsi9w7HDw"
,Recommended,575140,31512337,Posted: 2 May,all,Apollyon,"Surprisingly very enjoyable game. Seems like Painkiller, mb a bit Serious Sam, but reminds for me more Necrovision, I mean style. Very easy graphics, nothing special, but nothing bad. Actually there is no good optimisation or graaphic settings, but thats no terrible(see the price, right?).I especially want to mention the soundtrack - Slayer+Mech+something like Behemoth, and mb a few meldic-death. Btw its really colorfull with game and enjoyable. Gameplay is very similar like Painkiller, but with one thing - no medkits make it really hardcore game sometimes.Unfortunatale there is no achievements - why? Idk, mb devs will add that later, I hope. Also I wanna a few better optimisation, and a few graphic settings. But for this price its pretty good game to have fun."
,Recommended,575140,31958810,Posted: 25 May,all,Ya Girl RadNat,"I paid 50 cents for this game, NO COMPLAINTS, it's pretty fun. Room to room, round based shooter with cool weapons and sweet music. The Ragdolls are hilarious, especially with the SHOTGUN.If I had a complaint it'd be that the chain weapon you start with is USELESS, and you pretty much need to eat damage if you try to use it"

76561198004588005,Recommended,575140,31473939,Posted: 30 April,all,Ikari,"I got this for a $1. Not sure how much this game was when it was released. Don't get me wrong, the game looks pretty bad and it could have more interface options like many other first person shooter to make the game more user friendly but I got it for a $1. The game is rewarding, such has executing well time attacks to kill monsters, even early into the game and featuring a checkpoint system after a game over. I can't really say that's a bad thing or a redeeming feature. It's in the game, so $1 for a game with forgivable features and decent gameplay like this is a bit of a steal."

,Not Recommended,575140,33914844,Posted: 30 July,all,Redbeard,"Cemetery Warrior 3 feels like a somewhat upgraded version of Doom from the 1990s, although not as much fun.You are in a fort/complex built of rock, which you run around in killing monsters, of which there are several types.The first type of monsters (zombies?) seem to be able to hit you with their arms from about 20 feet away - which would be acceptable if their arms were 20 feet long, but they're not.That especially seems to happen when you've attacked them and then moved away. Possibly the game is still registering you as being near them? Whatever the reason, it's annoying.There are several weapons available to fight the monsters with.You start the game with a chain, then obtain a machine gun when you get to the next level, and then a shotgun after that.The shotgun seems rather over-powered, but you don't get a lot of ammo for it, so it balances out.I was tempted to give this game a thumbs-up (making it just over the line at a 5.5), seeing it's just a cheap game (and you get what you pay for); but, even with that considered, it just didn't seem to be particularly enjoyable or worthy of recommendation.There's not a lot to the game; not much in the way of a story-line, and it brings nothing new to the genre.It certainly didn't leave me thinking, ""Well, that was a bit of fun"".If this game appeared in the mid-1990s, then it would have had some credibility - although not a lot, as per the above-mentioned problems - but as a modern game, it just doesn't make the grade.Overall, Cemetery Warrior 3 was underwhelming and forgettable.Not the worst game I've ever played, but just not good enough to recommend.4.5/10."
