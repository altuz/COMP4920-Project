You build insults and try to defeat your opponent with them. Usually they don't make any sense, but that is why these games are funny. There are some gameplay improvements like comebacks and it shows the score of each sentence now, but I honestly think that most sentences that come out of the list or from your character's own list aren't as good as in previous game. Delivery is alright, but the first one had much more funnier characters (and better voice acting) than in this game. Workshop is a nice addition, but pretty pointless in my opinion. Art style is good for the most part, but I just find long arms a bit distracting, but it's not a deal breaker.You most likely get what you want. I would recommend this game if you liked the original, and it's cheap."

76561198259988601,Recommended,575330,32237293,Posted: 7 June,all,MechanicCave,"This is better than the original game.You can be famous parodies of film stars with different strengths and weaknessess, and original (and often really funny) situations. There is so many more insult combinations that you can make with the increased volcabulary and a new ""Comeback"" system that replaces the original insult endings from the first game. If you are dealt enough damage, then you can charge your comeback up to 3 times. The more your comeback meter is charged, the better comeback you'll say.AnywayPros:Twice the volcabulary of the original gameNew and unique characters with their own strengths and weaknessesGreat voice actingOften hilarious resultsStrategy, the dumbest insult isn't always the best. You have to think ahead and plan what you should do if your enemy chooses a sentence that you are planning on taking. Not planning ahead will often cause you to fail and do no damage to the enemy.That feeling when the enemy is on 1 HP and you're only at 75%. Should you do a simple insult to finish them off, or should you burn them to the ground with an enormous monster insult with a stage-three comeback?Custom characters: I'm not sure how it works exactly, but apparently you can create your own characters via the steam workshop.Cons:None of the characters from the original game return, which means no saying that someone ""moves like a pregnant yak"" with my favourite character Lo Wang :(The characters' arms look like limp noodles...Some insults may insult the player too, but if you didn't want to be insulted, why did you buy it?The game is 3 times the price of the original, but still cheap.Not for gamers who don't have a sense of humor"

This is one of those games you should pull out at a party to kill some time and have a few laughs. The computer makes a fine opponent as well.

After taking it for a drive, I expect I'll be spending many hours on this one, just as in the original. There are some improvements in the game, sometimes allowing for even more constructive sentences, which have a tendency to make more sense overall and can allow you to be a bit more creative.Also, I'd like to add there are some minor flaws which I expect will be cleaned up as time goes by (the game has only been out a few days). This mainly includes phrases spoken which don't match up at all with the words you chose. Though this has little to no impact on the gameplay, it is minorly distracting.Overall, I recommend this game if you played the first, but do keep in mind this one has a different feel to it, especially as the overall theme revolves around acting/Hollywood/etc.Also, as a sidenote to the developer, if you're reading this: Could you PLEASE :)  lower the volume of the intro credit scenes? I'm talking about the first two momentary screens that load, when the game first loads. The sound effects/music are extremely loud (RIP headphone users). I've adjusted the volume in settings for the gameplay itself, but it has no effect on the game intro music (perhaps a bug?). I love the game, but always dread that 150 decibel flute that starts playing. It's a cute/creative intro, I wouldn't change it, except for the music level."

,Recommended,575330,32106125,Posted: 1 June,all,GoldFish (SVK),"Great game about duel of the wits. Come up with a better insult composed of randomly generated set of words, beat your opponent, win. Pretty fun.This game has deeper gameplay mechanics than its predecessor (Oh... Sir! The Insult Simulator). I personally miss the Monty Python references that were ever-present in the first game very much. Also the insults seemed more funny to me in the first game.This is still a recommendable game, for the price. If you liked the first game, this is a must get - more or less the more of the same thing with deeper mechanics. If you're a newcomer, I'd probably recommend trying out the original Oh... Sir! The Insult Simulator first."

The set-up and organization of the game feel much more fleshed out and complete than the first version. That being said honestly I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about most celebrities so a few of the references went over my head and most of the ones I did get felt like cheap family guy references.So it's kind of a mixed bag for me: more and better game, kinda lamer insult experience.

,Recommended,575330,32105396,Posted: 1 June,all,LotusBlade,"I personally dont like 'Oh... Sir' sequel. Yes, i agree that game became much deeper and pleasant in terms of possibilities and variabilities for building interesting insults, yet, it became less fun. First of all, there is more pause between words so it takes longer to talk (or atleast it looks like it). Second, 15 seconds is not enaught to read and understand all those sentences for someone who is not perfect god of english. I am seeing players doing a lot of mistakes, i do them as well, not because of missclicks, but cus we dont even understand which part of sentence this 'xxxx' should be put in. Right now there is no proper interface feature that can help you understand which words is usable there or there.The next ptoblem is, most insults are way too much specific. It appears that a good part of those require some special treatment just like Hovercraft in prequel - its really hard to use it right. And there are way too many of such words. Moreover a good pile of people mentioned here are a mystery to me. We all know Gendalf, Harry Potter and Marilyn Monroe, but who the heck are these guys we insult in text? Well, just now i checked Steve Buscemi and do remember this guy from Boardwalk Empire, yet, 95% of others are unknown to me. I dont understand how to build sentences around them and it requres you much more then just knowing who they are. It feels like i am forced to actually be one of those celebrities to understand their world and therefor insult properly in game.Now the last part, when you have first turn you get lots of possibilities, cus you probably just gonna steal the first 2 phrases good for damaging opponent. The second player often left with some crap which will deal 5-7 dmg in best scenario, but mostly will end up at 1-4. And, to be honest, all those mega smart insults are smart to an extent where they stop being funny and just become smart... Its not interesting to listen to them. I mean, in previous game there were lots of ways to harm opponent's pride, but right now it feels more like a bucket of vomit. I end up using 'your dog', 'next movie' and other things that i think are not an insults in a first place.So, what can be done to improve game?1) Add some more basic words and sentences, like mom and dad (i am missing those 'dumb and ugly', etc stuff);2) Add 1 additional line of random words to the middle field, its now hard to build properly with increased vocabulary;3) Songs with words inside which are played on background are not just ruining atmosphere of this game but also annoy a lot;4) When game is minimized it should play sounds, which will help us understand when its time to get back to 'insults tab', since staring into monitor for 15 mins until i find opponent isnt right;5) Some heroes are booring and anooying, like that bonsai girls and Monroe - if you gonna add more characters, make them agressive, loud and harsh like Serious Sam... So we can understand what they are saying;6) Solo campaign (careere?) is kind-a booring, mostly cus enemies are mega dumb; and repeating the same quests for every hero is silly - give everyone different quests, so we have something interesting to aim for."

You now have a comeback meter which will slowly fill as you take damage, and can be used to add a witty ending to an insult adding between 4 - 10 points to the insult depending on the meter level.By far the biggest enhancement is simply more information though. You can now see how the parser is assessing the insult and the scoring for each individual clause, so it's a lot easier to understand why certain combinations are scoring higher than others.The core gameplay remains largely unchanged, which is not a bad thing, and the humour is mining that same satircial, python quoting seam as the last game. If you enjoyed the last game  this is a no-brainer. If you haven't it's hard to go wrong at this price."

A sense of humour is obviously required. :)It's the same basic mechanic as the first game, with some additions. The characters and dialogue are all new, and the scoring system is much clearer and seems to have been improved a little. The single-player ""Career"" has various objectives to complete so the challenge is a little more engaging. It's still pretty easy to win though.The possibility of adding custom characters via Steam Workshop is intriguing. Hopefully a few gems will emerge from the talented army of modders online."

Nuff said, amirite?Seriously though, the developers did improve on the gameplay with the addition of comebacks. And the characters are deeper, somehow they did manage to make a mashup of Clint Eastwood and Harry Potter work. But it is also harder now to say things that are terribly inappropriate in an implicit way. Such as ""your face smells of your mother"", that was a favorite of mine. Not sure if this was intentional.So the game has improved but I still miss the level of crudeness possible in the original. Oh well, at least I get to play with a greasy wizard."
