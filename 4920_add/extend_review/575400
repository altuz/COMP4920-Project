,Recommended,575400,29070447,Posted: 6 January,all,gameface,I checked out Try Hard Parking when it was in early access and found it made me rage.  If you like a game with a real challenge this should fit the bill.  I did an updated video for my channel.  My rage level didn't max out and my controller survived unscathed so I have to give Try Hard Parking my seal of approval (whatever that's worth).Leave a comment on the video to have a chance to win a Steam Key for Try Hard Parking. I have two keys to give away and will announce the winner on this Sundays episode of Seven Days.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NljYS0Wd170

,Recommended,575400,29056346,Posted: 6 January,all,Achebé,"Good game but really too short and not really hard. Only 40 minutes to beat every levels. Controller strongly recommanded because the control on the keyboard are awful. It's only difficult when you chase a gold time.Once again, the game is good but a map editor could be very appreciate.PS : if you have struggle to pass one level, go play something equal to your skill. Like, Gone Home or Dear Esther."

,Recommended,575400,31696984,Posted: 12 May,all,Metrike,"I don't get why people think this game is so difficult, you just have to spend some time learning the game physics and the controls. I think people just played it, rage quitted the game after a short while and declared it as impossible, without even trying to learn it. I think the game is really fun and worth the low price.  Only downside is how short the game is, but hopefully there will be more levels soon."
,Recommended,575400,29196798,Posted: 11 January,all,SkyL3R,"""Hardest and most Rage Inducing Parking Game in The World"".Gotta say that's actually true.The controls of the cars are sharp, so you are to be very precise, when getting over the obstacles.The neon graphics and the synthwave themed music are pretty nice,Sadly, there are not too many tracks, however, they are quite unique.7.5/10"

76561198077268507,Recommended,575400,29912991,Posted: 13 February,all,HammerToTheFace,"I Love this game!! The aesthetic and music are superb and the mechanics are on point!I would definitely pay more for a more fleshed out version, more levels, perhaps a level editor...The only thing negative to say would be that you can't use your controller in the menus (but I'm sure that's being worked on).Gearspecs, keep on doing what you're doing, for the love of god!!"
,Recommended,575400,29899819,Posted: 13 February,all,stanty16,"Fun, but very short.Reminds me of browser flash games I played when I was younger. Enjoyable, but very short (Completed in 23 minutes logged).If you enjoy games like Trials, you'll enjoy it, but it really needs a lot more levels I feel"
76561198043379927,Recommended,575400,29244455,Posted: 14 January,all,maxilboia,"A good game with awesome background music that you can listen while playing.Car controls may be a bit difficult and frustrating at first.It would be great if after completing all the game levels you could unlock new cars with different driving styles (more gentle acceleration, better breaking or turning) to try and improve your best times. This would improve the replayability and longevity of the game too."

,Recommended,575400,29102987,Posted: 7 January,all,Mr Tnk,"a very fun and addictive game, but a word of warning it contains the trials evolution/fusion effect, that means rage by constatnly trying to improve your times or completing some levels, overall 10/10 keep up the good work"
,Recommended,575400,29151416,Posted: 9 January,all,cheese.nachos12,"Fun, challenging game.  Kind of dissapointing how short it was.  I got only 50 minutes worth of gameplay.  It is very cheap, however."
76561198069536432,Recommended,575400,29010823,Posted: 4 January,all,Hardcore Motherfucker,Very hard game yet is fun to play and the retro experience is also very nice.
,Recommended,575400,29919456,Posted: 14 February,all,9000 Aero #SAAB TURBO,Good but way to short so the game needs more levels.
76561198130616834,Recommended,575400,29045793,Posted: 5 January,all,XxF3ARELIT3xX,Really Ragingly Frustrating. Was Recording A Video For YOUTUBE. Got To Level 4. Couple Minutes Later I Ended Up With A Smashed Battery Pack And A Nearly Broken Controller. Over Than That I Can See This Game Going Far And The Miami 80s Sorta Retro Style Is Amazing And Really Like The DeLorean Too. I Wish The Devs Good Luck

,Recommended,575400,30533790,Posted: 15 March,all,no swearing relax be cool,"What grabbed my attention to this game was the 80's asthetics and the DeLoreans! I love DeLoreans.Fun game.Only bad thing about it is the delay, and that seems to be a common issue.The game would be so much more entertaining if the delay was removed.I'd like the developer to answer me: Was the key-to-movement delay intentional?"

,Not Recommended,575400,29100795,Posted: 7 January,all,Laika,SHORT VERSION:I am too noob for this game.LONGER VERSION:I know the whole point of the game is to have sh*tty controls which make it very hard to play but this level of sh*tty and hard is just too much. I needed half an hour and 40 tries to beat Level 1. Not my kind of game.
,Recommended,575400,29007446,Posted: 4 January,all,Nugget,I couldn't even beat level 4. Rage inducing indeed.
