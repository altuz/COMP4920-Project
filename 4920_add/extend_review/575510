76561198132354359,Not Recommended,575510,29562759,Posted: 29 January,all,TastyNutz,"I'm not a fan of giving negative reviews, however this game isn't really worth $8. The problem I have with this game is the limited number of backgrounds and characters. You don't get to see the enemies or the main protagonist (your character). Using my imagination to picture the enemy in my head isn't somthing i'm very fond of. As I am not too far into the game yet my opinion is subject to change, of course. On the bright side, the main protaganist is very comical-- especially with his sexual innuendos. Even though these are the same perverted jokes common to most anime, it doesn't come off as any less entertaining.The 2 female characters are very actractive though.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi1MH_mVOmg"

I liked the MC, at least he’s quite honest (and doesn’t act like a clueless “little saint” or tries to “calm down” his hormones all the time lol). The girls were cute, and the story was… Meh.I liked the crossover with $akura Beach tho, I did not expected thatThe stories of the $akura games never made sense… But this one was bad. All the pitiful fight scenes have no CG or whatsoever, just the girls have their own. Which I can understand, it’s a fan service game. But the price is insanely high for just a few CGs with a poorly written story. The other games were somewhat enjoyable, but this one isn’t.3/10. Buy it only on a huge sale AND if you want to complete your collection. If you’re new to this franchise, don’t waste your money or time, there's still hope for you. lolAlso, I’d love to see Inma’s art in another visual novel besides the $akura franchise and A Little Lily Princess. They’re very talented."

76561198069159152,Recommended,575510,31122499,Posted: 13 April,all,wrb41977,"This game is Sakura meets James Bond. As in you play a secret agent who likes to get with beautiful girls... and hey, here are two now! Over the course of the game you bond with them and probably end up in a relationship with them. Getting all the CGs is relatively easy, and there is a guide for the trickiest achievement (the card game). The cards are also nice looking.There is a patch to enable more explicit content. Frankly, considering you are a lethario agent... probably a good idea..."
76561198147140160,Not Recommended,575510,34938988,Posted: 13 September,all,Player_1,"You know, I was heavily biased in favor of this game. My last experience with Winged Clouds, Sakura Santa, promised overall improvements in how they developed visual novels. And I always loved this artist's (called Inma, btw) anime girls at least as much as I love secret agent stories. Mix it with a supernatural theme giving off an MIB-vibe like here and I'll practically be your personal b*tch.Let it be said that having all this going in its favor, Sakura Agent may be the Winged Clouds WORST effort to date in making a Visual Novel. This time, they couldn't even properly program the music to play in the title screen. Congratulations in that regard, I guess.The story and characters are so forgettable, I don't even know where to start since stuff just seems to happen here and there, out of nowhere. There was a poker scene that I halfway enjoyed and was the highlight of my experience. I swear things just happened randomly in the story to forcefully tie in with the commissioned artwork from Inma. I'm not exaggerating.Don't buy this abherration of a VN, except if you are studying on how NOT to develop one. Or morbid curiosity. Please, please, PLEASE, remember that if you are here for dem sweet animu tiddays, you can find them very easily looking in the right places."
,Recommended,575510,31694548,Posted: 11 May,all,The Angry Sakura Game Nerd™,"Honestly, one of the better sakura games availible on steam, although this game's story tends to follow winged cloud's two girls+one guy=threesome schtick, I actually enjoyed this one.for anyone who has played the sakura beach games, there is a nice little easter egg in the game you will encounter and appreciate.besides the fact that a lot of the game is straight up porn with the uncensored patch, the art in this game is done by the better artist (in my opinion) at winged cloud. with that artist, the story minus the porn and outrageous sexual hijinks that comes with the sakura games actually ended up being pretty interesting. definetely not lacking in the creative department there.overall, if you are buying this for the porn and want to support the winged cloud team, do it. but if you are looking for a SUPER SERIOUS DRAMA FILLED ROMANCE VISUAL NOVEL avoid all sakura games. these VNs are meant to be enjoyed and give a comedic feel like a rom/com ecchi anime, not taken as seriously as a Triple-A title."

In all seriousness, this VN is pretty standard as far as Sakura games go, so if you're a fan of this franchise, give it a whirl. For those not interested in ecchi fan service, you'd be better off looking elsewhere for your visual novel fix."
