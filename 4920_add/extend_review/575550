,Recommended,575550,29215169,Posted: 12 January,all,drew8898,"It's hard to look at a game that releases on sale for nearly 1 USD and not think it'll end up being garbage.  Nevertheless, sometimes it's worth giving these little games a fair shot.  I'm glad I did for Hell Girls, at least.Let's start with what I don't like after about an hour of play.Cons:- Not fully translated into English.  There are a small number of text boxes that still come up in Kanji.  Mostly it's the alert boxes that say ""You don't have enough experience for X"" or ""You don't have enough currency to buy Y.""  These aren't important to the game as you can figure out what they're telling you based on context, but it's annoying nonetheless.- Not translated into English very well.  English was not the first language of whoever translated the game.  It's not bad enough that you can't tell what the characters are saying, but it's bad enough that you laugh at a line or two.- Art style outside of battle.  It's incredibly simple, and doesn't mesh well with the in-battle art style.- Boob physics.  Can we not, please.  It's distracting how much they bounce giving how little the girls move.Pros:- Boob physics.  Don't judge me!- Mini-events that appear during a match3 ""battle.""  Sometimes a bomb will appear on a tile with a countdown, and you have to match tiles ina  certain way to destroy it before it damages you.  Sometimes a chest will appear that will reward you when destroying it.  Sometimes tiles will get ""cursed,"" dealing damage to the character every turn until you use them in a match.  These little events keep the match3 experience from getting stale, and ccould potentially add an interesting amount of depth and difficulty as the game progresses.- There's a world map.  Anything that reminds me of the old Puzzle Quest games gets an extra point in my book.  I feel like I'm uncovering a world with each section I reveal.- Quests.  There's stuff to do on the world map.  =DAt 2 USD (or 1.19 for the launch sale) this game hits the sweet spot for value for money.  It's not the best match3 game.  It's fairly average, but at this low of a price, you can't go wrong.  And the RPG elements ensure that there will be plenty to do hours on end.  If you're looking for more match3 in your life, Hell Girls looks like it will turn out to be a hidden gem."
,Recommended,575550,32323554,Posted: 10 June,all,Apriarcy,"This was by far the most unique ""Match 3"" style of game I've ever played. Not only are you matching 3 or more of the same tiles, this time you have an actual reason to be doing so. You're using the matching icons to battle the enemy on the right side of the screen. You need to manage your health and shields as well while exploiting the enemies weaknesses to magic or physical while ALSO trying to open chests and prevent the enemy from altering your board.There are 3 different characters that you'll need to level up. Yeah, that's right. This is an RPG as well boys. You'll need to level up, unlock and manage armor and upgrade and manage spells. Using the right characters againts your enemies and properly equipping them will make some major differences in the success department.It looks like the game has been updated to include some new CG, but I haven't personally seen them yet. I 100%'ed the game before the update. Hopefully some work has been put into the English translation as well, it wasn't bad, but it definitely needed some work."
,Recommended,575550,32926683,Posted: 28 June,all,Athravan,"My entire steam recommendations feed seems to be anime from playing this one game now... oh well, time to embrace it.Hell Girls is a link & match game with a hefty dollop of anime fanservice on top. It's casual, it's got terrible, cliché dialogue and the desperate attempts to add sexual overtones just made me giggle and facepalm a little. But despite that all sounding negative... it actually works. It's fun, it has an up-beat fighting style soundtrack, bright colours and quite a bit of content. The opponents are reasonabley varied, and each does have a skill that makes you play a little differently. You have three characters and you can choose between them for most of the maps; with a few maps being locked to one specific type. You can choose their spells and upgrade them, and there are a few outfits that get skimpier and skimpier (naturally, who doesn't go into battle in their underwear or a bikini) but do actually make a difference to gameplay.It just works and argh, it's addictive!Most people will describe this as match 3 but I call it link & match - you can make long chains of as many matches as you want going in any direction. The longer the chain, the higher the reward (physical damage, magic damage, armor or health) and the bigger the bonuses. Each character has a unique bonus that triggers from the special spellbooks that are created from long chains. Making combos and setting up the board for something massive is genuinely entertaining, and makes you think ahead a little. It doesn't have a great deal of depth though, and goes from insanely easy to annoyingly hard in an instant.Of course it's all very x-lite. It's a casual game through and through and yet I STILL KEPT PLAYING IT! No matter how dumb I think the sexual cutscenes and skimpy outfits are, I simply cannot deny that I enjoyed playing this game. So much so, I 100%'ed it.☑ Pros: ☑Genuinely fun, addictive gameplayJust enough differences to add some strategy to stop it getting boringLarge map, plenty of contentAchievement hunters will find it relatively easy to get 100% onAtmospheric fighting music ♬ ♬☒ Cons: ☒Stupid sexualisation and anime fanservice (maybe you'll put that in the pros, if you do, I'll try not to judge you.. but you're making it hard for me)Terrible storyline, including plenty of typos and poor translation on some things. Seeing angels constantly typoed angles from one character triggered me. The angles will save us! Mmhmm.Pretty easy for the first map, then grindy for the second with nothing in betweenDoes get repetitiveWhat can I say? This is a game that I hate that I love. I recommend it if you're looking for a casual matching game, but I wish it had more depth and better writing."

76561198158309410,Recommended,575550,29543429,Posted: 28 January,all,Lady Chaos,"Friend, who gifted me this game, said something similar to: ""This is a pretty decent time-waster"". That is a perfect way to describe this game. It isn't nearly interesting enough to keep you interested on its own, but as something to play in the ""background"", when you are listening to podcast or half-watching something, ""Hell Girls"" are perfect choice. Story is stupid, badly translated and completely skippable, but the gameplay is good and it actually gets challenging and requires a little bit of strategy (although Thunder Girl is really overpowered).Plus, for the price of 1,99€, you get a well-made game that lasts about 3-6 hours, which is a good deal. It's pathetic that some developers put some half-naked anime girls in poorly made games and then charge 10-20€ for it. ""Hell Girls"" is not a game like that. The developers clearly care about making decent games AND about their customers - check out their refund policy.Recommended as a ""background"" game."

Simple time waster, minor rpg elements.Honestly, not a GREAT game, and I wouldn't recommend it except that frankly, the price is right. It's a $2 game, and it's worth maybe a bit more than that.Pros:RelaxingMatch 3 plus someCute anime boob jiggle and ""Yatta!""s.Cons:Pretty much zero story, in fact the small bits of dialog only serve to make you wish it had more.One of the few ways to alter your characters is by collecting and changing their outfits for special effects, but pretty much every outfit is a downgrade from the default (nerf some main abilities to buff one ability.) Usually not worth it which means no real reason to swap outfits. Plus it'll annoy you usually getting ALL of one girl's outfits first, then ALL of the next ones, instead of hunting down and getting different girl's outfits at a time.Eventually repetetive."

,Recommended,575550,30101682,Posted: 22 February,all,talgaby,"Short version: 63%Hell Girls is a bit clumsy, but enjoyable and fun little chaining match-3 combat game… as long as you can force yourself to not read the story (unless you speak Chinese).Long version:Hell Girls fills a rather large void in the casual scene, as it combines the combat match-3 genre with the tile-chaining mechanics instead of the more traditional tile swapping—which is, surprisingly, an almost non-existing combination in match-3 games.As usual for combat match-3 titles, there are only a handful of gem types (melee, magic, mana, health, shield), and creating longer chains nets more impressing results. Hell Girls’ unique mechanic is the introduction of skill books: chains of 4, 7, and 10 spawn books which act like joker gems. They can also destroy enemy blocks and treasure chests, so they are rather useful.The combat aspect offers three playable characters with distinct enough stats, spells, and skills—although you may end up favouring only one, because the game, while fun, is a bit shoddy in all aspects. For example, Fire Girl’s powers are horrible but she receives her bonus item the earliest. In addition, most enemies on later stages have rather cheap gimmicks (like being immune to all damage but skill books) that drag out the levels way too long.The story is… let us just say that even with the constant updates, the English translation is horrendous. If you manage to look past that, Hell Girls provides ample fun for its price tag, but not something that will enter the hall of fame of match-3 games."

Spend it. Fork it over. You won't regret it. Do it.
,Recommended,575550,29255633,Posted: 14 January,all,TheToad,"So, I just finished this game... and it's one of those games that you don't want to give a negative review, yet it is a bit hard to actually recommend it.Is it a good game?The gameplay is very simple. Connect 3 ""gems"" of the same type to make them disappear, and gain some sort of bonus (health, mana, deal damage, etc.) by doing so. Each of the three characters have some basic spells that they can spend their mana on, and it's also possible to find or buy certain items and skills for the characters.A game like this needs to be addictive for people to keep playing, however after the 4 hours that it took me to clear this game I pretty much felt like I had had enough. Then again, getting 4 hours out of a $2 game is not really that bad.The English translations are not very good, and I couldn't really understand what the story was about or some of the things that the characters were saying. However, there is (at least in my opinion) a certain charm to cute anime girls speaking broken English, so I'm willing to let it slide.One thing that I actually thought was pretty good was that the enemies in the game actually felt quite different from one another. One of the enemies gave me quite a headache until I figured out how to deal with it. Actually having to adjust your playstyle depending on the enemy was a nice and unexpected plus.So, do I recommend this game?It's very hard to say yes. However, it did have a certain charm to it, and the developer seems to be fairly active in the forums, listening to feedback and fixing bugs.I really wish that it was possible to give a neutral rating, but seeing as it is not, I'll just ask myself these two questions:- Do I regret buying this game? No.- Would I buy it again? At a 40% discount? Yes.As long as you're not expecting to get more than a couple of hours of casual fun out of this game, I'd say it's worth it."

It can take a few tries on some levels, as One Girl's Element & Abilities may be better suited than the others.A helpful suggestion: Don't stick to just 1 Girl, as this will probably lead you to a Dead End @ some point in thew game, where you can't advance.I also suggest replaying some levels so you can earn enough coin to buy the higher skills earlier, as they do make a difference.I had fun in the short time it took me to complete Hell Girls. Can be semi-difficult, but not overly or impossible."

I had played HuniePop before and seeing that it's a Match-3 sort of game, I thought I could give it a shot. As it turns out, while not much similar to HuniePop it was rather entertaining. Completed the game in its entirety (with a little griding at times).My main complaint was with the lacking English translation (and sometimes missing translation). I contacted the devs a number of times offering to help out with this - and as it turns out I rewrote the English translation. Devs were very encouraging and accepting."

I am not a big fan of match 3's however I thought it wasn't a huge install so I'd give it a shot.It's actually pretty decent, it's obviously not breaking any new ground, its not going to win game of the year, hell it's probably going to be forgotten about if you get it after 6 months. However for £0.95, its a fun 6 hours or so. That's how long it took me to finish the game.It reminds me of puzzle quest which I had on the xbox live arcade, kind of a mixture of RPG and Match 3, but with much less depth. There's the added bonus of fanservicey waifu's and stuff.The game I'd give a solid 5/10, not great, but not terrible. However buy it for the price, support this dev and their practices. :)"

Also, naked and very subjective scenes. You can find new outfits for them which grants boosts to your character too.You can level-up your ladies and buy some new skills for them to use. You collect the stuff required to upgrade and buy new things by winning an encounter with a group of monsters and the better you perform, the more rewards you get. If you're not quite strong enough to win the fight, you're still rewarded too, albeit receiving quite a bit less stuff.Graphically speaking, the art style of the game isn't to my likings. It's passable. Also the story... Is a little underwelming to say the least. It's poorly written and it doesn't really make any sense. However, the music and the gameplay is where this game shines in my opinion. The songs are quite repetitive, but I love their vibes. As for the gameplay, well the game is just pretty fun to play.An additional note if you are going to play this game, be sure to understand you have the ability to create spellbooks where you want! I did not understand at first and I was losing a ton of games due to being unable to open chests and getting killed by spiderlings. When you match 4+/7+/10+ tiles together, the book appears where you are finishing your move! Of course, if tiles falls beneath it, the book will fall... But you get the idea!Also, the length of the game is quite.... Eh... It takes about 2 to 4 hours to complete, which is a little on the short side, but the game is 2 bucks.Overall I'd say this game is worth it if: You like anime games, you like match-3 games or you like games that are relatively easy to get 100% achievements in."

,Recommended,575550,33406007,Posted: 9 July,all,Blinkdog,"for a match 3 game its not bad but if you just want the sexy pics its not worth it.why? there are only 6 and even with the uncensored patch (look in the guides part though its in german) they are not all that satisfying. you get one pic at the beginning but then you wont see another till about mid game, then the rest are that the end. with no nudity during fights (there is a 2 piece swimsuit) if this is your only reason just for thinking of getting this just go to the games pictures and save the different ones. they have both the censored and uncensored ones there.GAMEPLAYyou are not timed and though the enemies can change some icons on the board they do not match them. you play by dragging your mouse over 3 or more of a icon to do its ability like swords/stars do damage, blue potions give mana (you start at 0), shields refill armor, and hearts refill hp. you can connect icons by going up, down, or diagonal and the more you connect at a time it will spawn a spell book for said girl. these books can be chained with any object and will do a spell depending on who you're using and the number of items you chained to make the book. these also break open chests and destroy object the enemies place on the board.there are also rpg elements in here where you can level each girl to Level 15. you can also find or buy spells that use your mp that damage, heal, buff, or debuff and you can take up to 5 in to battle. each girl has 3 outfits each to unlock (school uniform, school swimming uniform, and a 2 piece swimsuit). these and the spells are found by breaking open the chests on levels and as for as i know are fixed to location (not random). x item is found on x level and redoing levels you got the chest on wont give another reword though the chest will respawn.GIRLSthe red head is your strongest hitter but has the worst spell books for breaking open chests as they only effect icons around the book. late game she does get a spell that can damage special icons.the brunet is the mid character. has ok states all around and her spell books effects icons in strait lines.the white haired girl is week but her spell books hit any special icon on the level (chests and breakable items) if there are none it will add damage to an attack.GLITCHES AND OTHER ISSUESto beat the game you'll need to grind a bit to level all 3 characters. the 2nd board will split up your 3 girls to fight alone so if they are under level you'll need to go back to grind.there is a glitch that if you finish a match at the bottom of the board sometimes it will not vanish and there will be 2 icons there. you can see what it is by hovering over the it.some of the items tool tips are not translated so you have no idea what they do till it activates."

The matching technique is quite simple, match as many crystals as you can, even around corners. Enemies have special abilities that you will need to work around, which steadily increases the difficulty of the game. What I also liked is the fact that you can level your characters and customize their abilities, which really makes a unique play style possible. In addition, the achievements were easy to get, but the game offers so much more than that. I was honestly surprised.Plus points:+ different outfits with different stats to make your game even harder+ 4 save slots+ different difficulties/boss fights per level+ 18+ patch (for people who want it)+ several hours of playing+ tons of achievementsTo sum up, buy it, if you love match 3 games. If you aren't into that type of a game you will be disappointed. Content-wise, you get more than you pay for."

Without going into too much detail, I'll list most of the positives and negatives of the game, in my opinion.Positives;-Fun RPG/puzzle hybrid gameplay that has multiples enemies with unique abilities.-You need to think about which characters are better at fighting certain enemies.-Has a good bit of fan service in.-Has a very low asking price.-Just PM the developer if you want a no strings attached refund. You don't even have to delete the game.-For me, it took a decent amount of time to complete.-It ran perfectly well on my gaming laptop (Uses a Nvidia GeforceGTX 960m)-Supports 5 different languages, which I think is impressive considering the type of game it is.-The games 'story' does reflect the actions you make in game.Negatives;-It has a thread bare story, with the protagonists having almost no personality or character development to speak of.-Not very many soundtracks.-Not much background variety, a lot of them just look too similar to each other.-For the final boss you gain the ability to switch between protagonists during battle. I think this ability should've been available from the beginning in order to make good use of each characters unique traits and to discourage people from just picking one character as a 'main'.-Could use more CGs for that fan service.-In my opinion, the Hell Girl of Fire is just a little bit♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-Near the end of the games. A few enemy ability descriptions hadn't been translated into English, which was really disappointing to see.In conclusion, I spent very little money, for a lot of fun and I'd definitely like to see more games from this developer in the future."

,Recommended,575550,30504967,Posted: 14 March,all,MAGIC IS EVERYTHING,"Very addicting puzzle game, and like the creator's other games, it's a very good deal for the price.Basically, when you start a level, there's a grid with a bunch of different kinds of tiles. Then you try looking for any pieces that are neighboring each other that are the same, but unlike other games, you can go in all 8 directions, so people with keen eyes will have the upper hand. Some pieces let you do physical damage, others magic damage. Some pieces are special, like spell books, which can be combined with any other sequence for extra power and/or act as a gateway to reach a piece on the other side of it. Others let you recover health and store up MP which you can use for character-specific skills. You'll have to take into account what you need in the current situation so that you don't accidentally get killed while trying to rack up damage, because believe me when I say that difficulty ramps up rather quickly and you can get yourself killed if you don't pay attention. Also, there's no time crunch since it's turn-based, so don't worry about taking your time thinking about what moves to make.There's three girls to choose from that you can select before each level. Each girl has their own element and set of magic skills to help do additional affects during battle. These are integral to the gameplay; you can't really beat later levels without choosing the right chick. The girls themselves are rendered as 3D models and are pretty cute and sexy. You can unlock bonus costumes and skill increases as you progress through the game, so each one gets her own time in the spotlight depending on what the level requires.There is almost no story at all, but I don't really mind. It's a puzzle game at heart, and for the $1.99 price tag, I can't really complain about a game that does so well in what it sought out to do. Definitely get this game.Additonal note:Big tiddies are abound but nothing explicit and uncensored like in Super Star. I still recommend this game though."

I also like that this game doesn't require a large amount of time to devote to it in one sitting... the battles are simple enough that you can complete one in a few minutes.  Besides, the moe anime girls are entertaining as well.The English translations are a bit off, but not too much as to not be understandable.  In fact, they do add a bit of comedic charm to the game.All in all, I'm giving this one a hearty thumbs up.

,Recommended,575550,29239522,Posted: 13 January,all,Garce,"Edit: Three months after I wrote this initial ""review"", the dev is still patching the game and tweaking things. He cares about his games - and this IS a good game. Also corrected some spelling mistakes...------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A fantastic ""Match 3"" game (and I HATE those games) with RPG elements. Calling Hell Girls a ""Match 3"" game is doing it a bit of a diservice. This game is more of a ""Match Everything You Can"" - You can create combos that literally clear the screen.Most of the tiles provide benefits: Restore health, Increase attack / armour, fill the mana pool for magic attacks and healing, etc. But on the right side of the screen is a baddie that wants to f*ck your sh*t up. He / she / it attacks by adding tiles that increase THEIR damage and / or heal themselves.I really hate it when monsters heal.The English translation is hit or miss (Edit: April 25, 2017 - The English translation is MUCH improved.), and the game goes FULL JAPANESE after a half dozen levels or so. Note to dev: NEVER go FULL JAPANESE. I won't post any spoilers, but - yes - sh*t gets weird here. But I am having a blast. The gameplay is fantastic, but the poorly translated ""story"" tends to CRINGE at times. But the gameplay is solid. (Edit: Story is much better translated now.)Its a good game. And its one dollar.  But its not ""Match 3"". If you match 3 - you lose. You'll need to match four (weak) to fifty (kablooey!!!!). And those massive combos are SO SATISFYING! Because FARK YOU DEMON THAT I HAD TO COLLECT♥♥♥♥♥♥♥FROM! FARK YOU STRAIGHT TO HELL.Did I mention that the game gets pretty Japanese pretty fast? You've been warned. But its hilarious, its one dollar, and I am going to go play some more. Sure as hell beats the pay to play crap on Facebook.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: That is an lightly edited version of my frst impression of this game. It (the game) has gotten better over time. It gets updated. The dev actually seems to care about the games that he releases. And I have purchased all of his games as a show of support.This is a good farking game."

76561197971948490,Recommended,575550,32214837,Posted: 5 June,all,Wraith_Magus,"I'll go ahead and give this game a thumbs up mainly on the basis of the fact that I still enjoy playing puzzle games and it cost less than a soda when on sale.Gameplay consists of connecting tiles to perform attacks or heal yourself.  I've played several games like this, and the effect still is somewhat weird, since it goes against your natural puzzling instincts to want to go for a shorter combo that performs the action you want instead of just reflexively matching the biggest chain you can see.  In this regard, Hell Girls does better than many games, as it's purely ""turn-based"" (enemies only move after you make a chain), and so unlike games like 10000000 or Legend of Fae, there isn't that stressful demand for a split attention between targetting enemies and matching simultaneously.That said, the game has serious balance issues.  There are three girls, each elementally based, and the ice-elemental girl is just flat-out better than the other two.  This is because they all have both individual ""spells"" that are rewards for long chains (a Level 1 book tile appears for 4 in a chain, L2 for 7 in a chain, and L3 for 10 in a chain), and ""skills"".  Fire spells destroy nearby tiles, lightning spells target the bad blocking tiles specifically, and ice spells eliminate whole columns or rows.  This is a massive disadvantage for playing as the fire girl because you frequently need to eliminate whole columns or eliminate blocks that are difficult to place a spellbook tile near, while getting a spellbook in the same column is easy.  The skills make the Ice girl simply the best, because one of her skills freezes the enemy for three turns (four if you make her wear the bikini) and can be stacked infinitely, ensuring that the enemy can never attack you back while also draining the enemy.  So long as you manage to regenerate enough mana, you can stun lock the enemy and bleed them dry with ease... and another of the ice girl's skills is to convert HP recovery tiles (you don't need them, you're not taking damage) into mana recovery tiles, and still another makes 7 more tiles of a chosen type (14 if you wear the gym outfit) appear, making giant mana-generating combos easy.  There's a point late in the game where you need to use all the characters for specific levels, but since EXP is gained as a party, you can just grind with the ice girl in the colusseum until level capping everyone.The plot of this game is pretty much an excuse.  I feel like about three minutes of exposition was cut out of the beginning because I have no idea who the characters are or what they're doing in the place they are exploring until halfway through the game when they talk about their mission like you should have already known it.  The game's first line is even a minor character thanking you for saving him from monsters, with zero context.  The ending apparently feels obligated by the fact that it was made in Japan to wind up being a church conspiracy, because you can't have a JRPG without either a ham-handed environmentalist message or making the villains a stand-in for the Catholic Church.Regardless, the protagonists are apparently named ""Fire Maiden/Girl"", ""Thunder Maiden/Girl"", and ""Ice Maiden/Snow Girl"", (the translation isn't consistent) so don't expect too much, here.  Their personalities can best be described as ""angry but serious"", ""angry and psychotic"", and ""sulky"", respectively.   They constantly insult and/or threaten to murder everyone they meet or at least shake them down for every dime they have.  This is where the dialogue options pop in, and often amount to ""do what she just said she was going to do"" or ""do the exact opposite of what she just said she was going to do"", which is both often the right answer and also the one that makes her look schizophrenic.There is a patch out there that removes the underwear from the graphics, but to be honest, you shouldn't base your purchasing decision on that.  (Well, unless you're decidedly not into anime girls, in which case, even the ""wholesome"" censored version has you sending girls out into the tundra to fight ice monsters in bikinis.) There's only 5 such images, and all but one come from the end of the game, and they don't have any real context to the story, for that matter.Also, it's not important, but the animations are really silly.  The girls do a victory pose that involves swinging their swords through their own necks before ""resting their sword on their shoulder"" in a way that involves actually plunging it through their arms.  For that matter, they hold their sword in the first place by jamming a pair of fingers inside it's haft instead of gripping it.Ultimately, I was reasonably entertained for a few hours on a seriously low budget, so I don't really have much to complain about, but this is pretty clearly amateur hour stuff.  Not BAD, but really obviously lacking in polish to the degree that I was making fun of the game as much as rolling along with it.  That said, there were some times near the end where I had to replay the missions for full points (didn't defeat the enemies in a low enough time to get full score) and I quickly found I was pushing myself just to finish the game, and I don't have any interest in replaying it further.   If the game was any harder, I'd have quit from lack of interest rather than feel challenged to try a new strategy.  As such, I can only offer the usual caveat:  If this game LOOKS like the sort of game you like, it's probably something you'll enjoy, and if it isn't, you probably weren't bothering reading the reviews in the first place."
,Recommended,575550,29441369,Posted: 23 January,all,Vex,"It's a fun little puzzle game. While it's simple in its design, do not be fooled, this game will pummel you with no warning. Unfortunately, after an hour or so of play, I discovered there is quite the grind of replaying previous battles in order to earn the exp needed to level up the girls so they can actually survive mid-map fights. While this isn't so much a big deal if you love puzzle games, it can get on your nerves doing the same fights over and over. But, this is a great time waster that should be picked up if you like puzzle and / or anime games.Note: The translations from the Chinese are kind of funny and may cause some confusion to those not used to it. Luckily, I'm used to such things so I understand the devs meanings when things show up in broken English.All-in-all, pick this up.

There is some attempt to explain what's going on, but it's hard to understand.- The game has some minor bugs, and the tool tips can be difficult to parse.- The girls could use some balancingThe good:- Basic game play is clever; it's an interesting take on a match three game.- There is a bit of depth and strategy to the game play.  The girls each have their strengths and weaknesses, and they are customizable in some interesting ways (and not just the fan-service artwork.Note:- The game takes about 4-5 hours to complete; probably another 1-3 to unlock all the achievements.

Also, the music and sound effects can be repetitive, but I think it can be turned off.That being said: The gameplay itself is, in my opinion, rock solid. It requires you to think, and you have time to do so, since there is no time limit on your turns. The abilities you get are kind of interesting, and can make a difference if you use them appropriately. You can change them up as well, and combined with the 3 different outfits for each girl that changes her stats, you can make a strategy of your own.In short: Solid gameplay with a bit of inspiration from Puzzle Quest, and a game that will entertain you if you like the match 3 genre."

When I reviewed this game, I had completed it.  The developer has since added additional content to the game.  I haven't played it yet, but once I found out about the additional content I re-installed the game and am looking forward to playing it.  Additional thumbs up to development person or people.  ThanksEnd of Additional Review, below is my initial game review.Hell Girls is a fun little match style game.  Especially for the $1.19 or so that I paid for it.  There are a bunch of achievements, but I was able to get all of them in 6 hours of play time; not too difficult.  I was almost OCD on this game by the end and instisted on getting 3 Star Ranking on all of the levels.  So whatever my play time shows when you are reading this review, is how long it took to reach that goal.  Some of the monsters later in the game have some tough abilities to fight through that end up requiring a particular Hell GIrl (Fire, Thunder, or Ice) to defeat if you expect to meet the requirement for 3 stars.The graphics were quite good for the price and your three heroes are cuties even in all their different outfits.  The English translation is pretty bad, but you are able to get the gist of the ""quests"" if that is what you want to call them.  As others have mentioned, initially, Hell Girls had uneven sounds where some where low and others weirdly high.  The developer patched this issue since then and the sounds are more even and easy on the ears.Overall, I got my money's worth out of the game."

,Recommended,575550,32182512,Posted: 4 June,all,Gouko Tenrou,"Where to start......Firstly, this is not the kind of game you want people you walk in on you playing (learned that the hard way)Hell Girls is hard to define, think of it like Bejeweld but there's ecchi elements to it. Hell you can take it straight to hardcore hentai if you apply the R18 patch (I'm talking about the unlockable art work here)You have three female characters you play with, each having access to one element for their abilities. Elements are Fire, Ice & Lightning.As you progress through the map defeating monsters you get experience and gold that allow you to level up your characters and purchase new skills. These skills get quite pricey at one point but are well worth it.Another thing to note is there are four outfits for each character, Combat, Student, Gym and Bikini are what I would call them. Each outfit has a different buff/de-buff for you character. This makes it interesting as certain outfits will be very powerful vs certain creatures whereas other will get you creamed (pun not intented)This is a fun little game and will most likely only appeal to you if you are an anime/echhi/hentai person, but lets face it if you are reading this then chances are you know what's up ^^Its a nice cheap game that is perfect for turning of your brain and enjoying a little bit of eye candy."

It's decently done and at times challenging if you want to 3* all the encounters.  There's simple progression/levelling with unlocking and equipping of skills.  It's not puzzle quest but it could do if you are starving for a clone of it, although simpler and watered down.  Don't get this for the H.

The game's mechanics are competent, with a decent RPG influence and some enjoyable combat abilities. You control three heroines who set out to save the world (or something), defeating monsters along the way. In most battles, you can freely choose your hero, with each offering different abilities (lightning, fire, ice). The battles are relatively easy, with a difficulty spike towards the later levels.The game's story is negligable and riddled with bad translations, but easily ignored. The art is better, with the world map deserving some praise.After key moments, the game throws in some ecchi artworks, which tend to seem somewhat out of place, but are still competently made.All in all, you get a fairly good game for a bit more than a buck that will keep you mildly entertained for some five hours."

,Recommended,575550,35371814,Posted: 1 October,all,DraxxorT,"It's a little fan-service-y, which shouldn't be unexpected, but the puzzle-based RPG gameplay is solid. It's a good twist on the standard ""match-three"" model, allowing you to chain ""gems"" in any shape you chose, rather than just straight lines. Creative pathfinding is required, rather than quick swapping. The battle elements have a pretty good learning curve. You'll rarely, if ever, die on the first map, but the second map poses actual challenges that will give you some close calls and require you to rethink your strategy.  It'd be nice if there were other game modes than the campaign, though. As it is, once you've completed the story mode (which is pretty light on story), there's really nothing left to do. It's cheap enough that I feel ok recommending it, though, despite the paper-thin plot and lack of replay value."

Hell Girls is NOT as 18+ as Huniepop, there are only 5-6 lewd CG pics and none of the huniepop ""night dates"",  but the gameplay is the same type of instantly gratifying semi-deep fun. Hell girls take on match 3 is pretty interesting and engaging, the game has no turn limits like in huniepop but instead your combos on the match 3 board do damage or give you health and mana. The opponent you are facing attacks you every couple moves, lowering your hp and/or placing damaging tiles on the map that must be destroyed. This system makes the game a bit easier than huniepop and more of a nice mindless timesink. The match3 system in this game is pretty interesting as well, as you can match in any direction and make matches over all of the board, leading to insane combos even in earlier parts of the game. There are 3 girls with different spells, playstyles, and stat-changing outfits, that give variety to the game.Pros- Its 2 bucks and has easily 8 hours of gameplay with tons of easy achievements- Has anime girls- Gameplay is easy but makes you feel like a match 3 god and has a few fun broken spells/builds- Enemy variation is actually pretty good and balanced, and some girls are actually better/weaker against certain enemies- Game has very little grinding for levels or gearCons- Lots of♥♥♥♥♥♥easy unnecessary fights early on- Gui is glitchy and dialogue boxes and parts of game overworld look bad- Doesn't have a hardcore mode or difficulty- The leveling is that lame jrpg type of leveling where your stats just go up a set percent every level and don't bring in anyhthing new or interestingOverall: For what it is its 4/5 ~ 4.5/5.

The achievements are a bit on the basic side, you can repeat the same battle over and over for the victory achievements (not what I did, I just revisited a few past battles when I got stuck.), and the rest either involve collecting a set number of skills or costumes or levelling up.Overall design is okay, but I think costumes could have varied a bit more, they all have the exact same school uniform, gym uniform and swimsuit, even a colour swap for these (For example, red swimsuit for Fire, blue for Ice and purple for Lightning) would've been nice.The only real issues I have with this game are the poor translation, it seems to have either been translated with Google Translate, or by someone who does not have English as their first language, as well as the not so random placement for enemy skill blocks, 99% of the time, they will somehow be placed in just the right spot to screw you over big time.All in all, if you're a fan of puzzle games, I'd recommend this, especially for how cheap it is.

Music is stock standard, four different loops that play on repeat, but they really went above and beyond with the singular sensual moan that played whenever I healed myself.

But the core mechanic turns out to be so much entertain and addictive. You have to match at least 3 in direction to damage opponent while keep your health and shield. Each turn allows you to use character skills as buff / debuff and let you think for best chain combos. The more you progress through story, the more skills, equipment, and challenge to unlock.The game might be overlooked due to some anime fan services (which is totally personal) and require some grinding. But the gameplay is very solid, casual, and fun. Worth every penny"

,Recommended,575550,33295700,Posted: 5 July,all,詐欺師,"Don't Shave That Hair!!!I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my♥♥♥♥♥hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. ""Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!"" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. ""How many Indians could there be?"" said by General Custer. ""Looks like a good day for a drive!"" by JFK. ""There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!"" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my♥♥♥♥♥of hair. Occassionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My♥♥♥♥♥was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.Little did I know.I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic♥♥♥♥♥♥ molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky♥♥♥♥♥♥sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my♥♥♥♥♥off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering♥♥♥♥♥♥sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my♥♥♥♥♥cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own♥♥♥♥♥♥blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: ""It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.""Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my♥♥♥♥♥at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for♥♥♥♥♥hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your♥♥♥♥♥having the texture of a brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.Friends, DON'T SHAVE YOUR♥♥♥♥♥HAIR!"

,Not Recommended,575550,32226521,Posted: 6 June,all,Bob Spigot,"Its a pretty crappy game, but I suppose you could figure that out from the screen shots.but I did expect it to be some cheeky fun trash, rather than how tedious it actually was.At first it seemed a pleasant surprise, the models arnt terrible, a few varieties of monster pop up and you get in to some of the mechanics. Then nothing much changes... from beginning to end the games feel more or less the same and it begins to really drag on as the monsters tank more and more damage. There isnt really any challenge to it at all, especially as one of the girls can basically keep a monster from attacking indefinitely so you just run through the motions battle after battle. Sure you unlock stuff but it ultimately makes very little impact on the fact you cant really lose anyway. (You are actually forced to use the other girls at points, it felt annoyingly luck based. One game youd fall apart, the next youd obliterate the enemy and with no discernable change in tactics or skill.)There isnt really a coherent story, the translation is bad enough that it goes beyond funny to basically incomprehensible and in some cases its not translated at all. Even if you are here to perv it gives just a handful of images, tame even when nude patched.Far worse than just being bad is being boring, and thats what this is, very boring."
,Not Recommended,575550,32078838,Posted: 30 May,all,Shrouded Wolf,"Well, the game does have some interesting ideas. They aren't exactly new, but it's competent enough in their execution to be acceptable. The addition of skills is also a nice bit that keeps the combat from being entirely run by RNG. It's not much, but it's certainly helps. Having multiple characters and, thus, slightly varied gameplay styles is a boon as well. And, of course, the pricetag is also inoffensive enough to not be a major issue for anyone that just wants to take a chance on something that looks interesting.So, why the rating? Unfortunately, the game itself, while competent, doesn't really do anything to stand out. The animations are incredibly basic, the story isn't noteworthy in any way, the music is forgettable, the art isn't particularly interesting, and even just the interface feels very...mobile. This may be fine on Android or iOS, but with as much competition as there is on PC (especially, in a genre as crowded as match-three), you really need something to draw you back in once you've had a play session.As a bit of a tip to the developer, pick a direction and stick with it. No story is perfectly fine, if the mechanics are solid and the other aspects (e.g. soundtrack, VO, etc.) are a well executed accompaniment. Alternatively, a well written and gripping story can help make up for somewhat flawed mechanics. Also, having something in your title that sets you apart from the rest of the pack is essentially critical...though, if that's outside of your scope, at least take the time to make sure that everything is well designed and properly tightened.The bottom line is that here was my experience with the title. I fired the game up and played it for a while, curious to see where it would go. Sometime later, I tabbed out of the game and eventually just closed it down. Around a week later, I fired the game back up again because, as the title was so lacking in anything notable that, I had no recollection of what this ""Hell Girls"" was and why it was installed on my tower."
,Not Recommended,575550,33390859,Posted: 8 July,all,jurchiks,"TL;DR - the game is crap. I've completed it 100% and it definitely was not worth it (damn completionism got the better of me). Started out pretty nice but got frustrating in the first few levels. After that it only got worse and worse.+the gameplay mechanic is unique and interesting, but that's where the fun stuff ends (unless you play this for the slightly erotic pics and ♥♥♥♥♥ bouncing animation, both of which are absolutely not worth it; just find the pics on the net if you must)-the graphics are bad, particularly on the girls; the models don't meet properly, textures are off, etc.-sometimes NPCs do their move even though it's not their move yet-several important items don't have English tooltips and you can only guess what bad effects they have - and they are pretty bad-sometimes items fall into each other, e.g. you create a book from a combo but it somehow bugs under the item below it, and you can't use it anymore; extremely annoying if you created the lv3 book from a very long combo)-the music is EXTREMELY annoying, but thankfully can be turned off (and you can't even open Youtube in background because for some reason while this game is running everything in the background just hangs up)-the game in general is a grindfest, you can't realistically finish it without grinding at some pointIt is pretty much impossible to get 3 stars in all levels unless you grind for exp in the arena and upgrade all your characters to near max level (particularly the ice girl is pretty useless early on and generally the weakest since her combos are not that good; both other girls' combos can be extremely good - I've managed to get over 2k on each).Basically, if you want to get any sort of enjoyment out of this, level up only the fire girl until you get to the arena; go through the left side of the map first to reach the arena, but be prepared as it will be pretty hard the first time, particularly the eye thing is very annoying and hard to deal with. The arena gives A LOT of exp compared to every other level; at the start you will be able to upgrade multiple levels on any girl from one completed arena. IMO a broken game mechanic, but without it you'd be pulling your hair out out of frustration.The second floor of the game will require you to use one specific girl in most of the levels, so this is where you will need to have farmed the arena because if you didn't level all the girls, you will get frustrated really fast."

Well, the good news is, Hell Girls have perfectly serviceable gameplay. It is hardly revolutionary - your classic Match-3 setup, with RPG-elements and useable skills attached... a model that hasn't really moved since the days of Puzzle Quest, way back in the near-forgotten days of yore. (Read: 2007)It's just that everything ELSE about this game is a mess. The story is near nonexistent, and what bits there are of it are poorly translated and filled with typos. You have to get rather far into the game before you even find out that your three heroines are supposedly angles sent to save the world from a periodic invasion from hell. (Well, okay, to be fair, the game manages to call them ANGELS maybe half the time.) By the time you reach the second world (which is around the time where the Steam Achievements run out), you're also going to start running into bits that just plain haven't been translated at all, so I hope you've brushed up on your japanese!The screenshots on display above might suggest to you that the game is, at least, rich in erotically-charged anime-style art. It isn't. As far as I can tell, the images shown up there are the ONLY ONES in the game. So if that's what you're looking for, just spend a bit of time perusing the available screenshots and save yourself some money.Well, if you're just looking for a cheap-but-competent Match-3 RPG, I suppose Hell Girls is a decent choice, at least if you catch it on sale. If you're expecting anything beyond that, though, you WILL be disappointed...EDIT: Since I bought the game, it seems a few of the 'erotic anime images' have disappeared from the preview screenshots. So hey, if you're desperate for a bit of softcore erotica, there might be another reason to get the game! It contains, like... 4, maybe 5 pictures. Extravagant!"

Bigger chains make better spell books.It can get a little tough at times, but that's mostly because enemies either hit like trucks (even when you have plenty of shield) or they have frustrating special attacks.Was it worth $2 dollars for 5 hours of mediocre puzzle game action? Meh.Even if you buy it for anime bewbs, there's a few still shots and you can wear a bikini in battle; I hardly even noticed that since I was just playing the game, not trying to perv out.Overall, again, meh.

,Not Recommended,575550,32106020,Posted: 1 June,all,Capt_Blakhelm,"Hell Girls is a weaboo trash Match 3 game that plays like Ironclasts and Hunie Pop, with neither the quality or the charm. First glance of the boring and weak trailer gave me a bad impression, but the low price and my love for the genre made me buy the game. There's a reason why this was on sale for $1.19 - while a reasonably solid, casual game, the hentai-esque characters and jiggly boobs are trashy, the animu moans are annoying, and worse off, the game is boring. While you can get some massive chain attacks or streaks of high damaged mixed with spell usage, the game never feels fun or interesting. There's nothing here you can find in a better match 3/RPG. Add to that, somewhat decent, but unexciting battle music that repeats endlessly and loops poorly, PS2 era cel-shaded graphics without anti-aliasing, and a program that doesn't close unless you go to windowed mode and click 'X' leaves you with a poor game.Look I've said mostly nothing but bad about this game, but if you like ""weaboo"" anime trash (which apparently, this game has a nude patch), and simple match 3 puzzle combat, you will probably love this game. If you're like me, and like Match 3 puzzle combat, and only care for ""actually good anime"", pass this up, and don't waste your time and money."
,Not Recommended,575550,31736846,Posted: 13 May,all,Vex,"The Match-3 genre is a simple one, and is arguable one of the hardest to mess up. Somehow, SakuraGame managed to not only mess it up, but also managed to not fix that mess at all. The game starts fine enough, but quickly descends into a bland and tedious grind that never really becomes rewarding. Whether it be from woeful incompetence or inexperience, SakuraGame deliver a dud.+ Clean, if somehow dated and simpistic graphics. They get the job done, but little else.+ Artwork is nice, to the point that it seems all effort went into it rather than the game itself.= Boring but otherwise servicable music and sound effects.- Characters can level, but they don't really mean much, and the cap is so low it's pointless--especially since the enemy stats continue to ramp up at an exponential rate. Leveling itself takes forever, especially when you have three characters to level independentally.- Characters can earn new costumes, but developer laziness entails that all three characters get a unique primary while sharing the exact same alternative ones (not even color changes).- Certain blocks must be destroyed with easily lost spell books, or by dropping the block in question to the bottom.- Enemy skills are poorly designed. Often they will spawn at the very top, in pairs or triples, with four turn delays. Not entirely awful, aside from the fact that they also can create blocks beneath them they require spell books to break, which can be sealed by runes. Enemies can also stack these on top of their own skills, or that of a previous enemy. Certain skills can even do twice your max health, leading to an instant loss.- Storyline is your typical mainstream anime garbage. Bland characters abound.Really, the game is so bad and poorly designed that the developer relies on anime boobs and recently added ecchi-esque CG to sell this crapper."

Sadly this is complete try and error. You must use the spell books to destroy it. OK so far so good. But saddly none of the three characters has any controll on what is hit by the spell books.The three characters also look to be somewhat inbalanced and not in a good way.
,Not Recommended,575550,31930115,Posted: 23 May,all,gamerhoofster-pony,"Hell Girls is a fun game similar to HuniePop. The differnce here is you can connect the same symbols as much as you want and in any direction of connecting will work. The goal is to elimitate the enemy quickly as possible in the smallest moves as possible.You have three warrior women to pick from. A woman that has fire element, a woman that has lightning element and a woman that has froast element. You can level up each woman sepertly by earning spirital point from beating missions along with earning money to buy element upgrades. When fighting enemies though you can't switch characters once dead, your health goes to zero your done but there can be up to 5 enemies per macth.Missions are based on by completing it and getting stars. One star is passable but to get all three you need to do it in less moves, get the specal items and not die. Once you complete another shows up from the dark of the map.The enemy verity is okay around 6-10ish enemies. However the enemy difficulty seems to be random. First enemy can very weak and the same enemy can be very stong.Winning a misson seems to also be more luck based then straghety base. I found it luck by getting a good set on symobs on the first round. There is no stragety really involved.Element books are cool, the player can create an element book by combining 4 of the same symbols. The player can boost up their attack or sheild or mana recovery along with doing some damage to the enemy by connecting 3 or m ore symbols to the element book. However the enemy can use their special ability and cover up those element books you worked so hard to create.The graphics in the game are okay and not the worst but there seems to be lag when set on the highest graphic setting.The sound is aweful though since the characters don't speak during diolog and only make any noise is during combat when using their specail ability or dying the the sounds are the same every time.The music isn't any better, there is like 2-3 music in the game so far I have played.With everything said and done Hell Girls gets a 4/10 score. There just isn't much here for players. You will mostly get annoyed at repeating sounds and music along with random enemy difficulty levels.Thanks for reading my review"

The achievements for this game are not well thought out.  You get an achievement every time you level a girl up, or you add a new costume (just the total count, not ""The bikini for Fire Maiden"" or anything). Other such achievements include ""chained 4 together"" then ""chained 5 together"" then ""chained 6 together"" etc.. also ""won 5 battles"" then ""won 6 battles"" then ""won 7 battles"" etc...I'm tempted to keep going just to secure the steam badge.. but that's really a dumb reason to keep going..."

Here's what I think.This is a decent game, like, not really good, not really bad, mediocre. You can have a bit of fun with it, but I miss something from it, and I can't really grasp what.What I  like about it:- 3 different characters for different ""playstyles"" on the levels (if you can't beat it with one, try the other)- I havent't got to the point where you can purchase clothing, but apparentl, as is the case with anime-style games, that's a big part of it- Fast-paced gameplay and plenty of insane gem combos/connecrions, you'll rarely be chaining only 3-4 gamesBut I don't like that even though they implemented buying skills, none of them feels necessary and all that impactful IMO. You can totally march through the game (I think so far) with the starting skills. Should have added more options (things) to spend you money on. This goes to show that mixing RPG with match-3 isn't always that good. It's not a bad game, it's decent enough, as I said, it just doesn't stand out so much so that I could really recommend it.If you want to try a great match-3 game with anime style, although it's adult-themed and not so child-friendly and the whole atmosphere is really different, try HuniePop. Like, even alone and/or friends, you can have a ton of fun and good laugh. Played it through once with a friend of mine, and we literally laughed in tears for the whole game, and IMO it's more enjoyable as it succeeds in bringing what it's promised, and has a more diverse gameplay all in all."

So I wish there would be inventory and more skills for purchase and use.After beating all monsters in the first map (or maybe getting all 3-stars? ), a second map will become available where the last 4 CGs are hidden. The last battles are really tough as the enemies are strengthened significantly, so utilise your rotation wisely.以这个价钱来说算是不错的休闲游戏。基本的游戏方式是连接多个同种类宝石进行消除，不同女主角有不同的优缺点和技能，需要根据角色特点来制定战法。剧情聊胜于无，CG基本只是单纯的福利，跟剧情也没多大关系，而且也不是小黄油那种级别的福利。中期需要稍微刷一刷经验，钱则是无所谓，后期多到用不完，如果能多一些装备技能的话就更好了。第一张地图的战斗全通过之后（或者是全3星之后？）会开第二张地图，后面4张CG都在第二张地图里。最后几战敌人大幅度强化，还是比较有难度的。"

76561197984092963,Recommended,575550,33686187,Posted: 20 July,all,Whizzy Charms,"This little gem of a match 3 style game provides a light-hearted, yet strategic story campaign that took me around fifteen hours to complete. The player guides three heroines of fire, ice, and lightning to various sites on a map while completing objectives, leveling, and acquiring new spells and outfits. When fighting monsters, the turn-based gameplay consists of matching three or more of a kind of five different gem types (mana, health, shield, physical and magical attack) to perform actions appropriate for the matched gem type.This game shakes up the match 3 formula in several ways. First, each girl has four slots for spells that can be cast during battle. The player selects the four spells among those spells compatible with said heroine and accumulated during the adventure. Spell abilities include effects that explode treasure chests, boulders, and certain other things on the game board; other spells might freeze a target for a number of turns or allow a player to change a single gem on the game board (and more!). Outfits further enhance certain skills, giving a nice variety of playstyles. Second, each girl has unique skill books that form on the game board upon matching increasing amounts of gems.  These offer fire explosions, chain lighting, or columns of ice to further manipulate the gameboard and defeat the adversaries. Thirdly, monsters attack and use skills that have effects such as placing scrolls on the field that limit certain abilities of the hell girls or placing giant bombs that the girls can then detonate in various ways. Monster actions are indicated in advance, allowing time to prepare a game board to deal with the monster skills however the player chooses.Translations can be a little rough around the edges for the storyline (one game board skill/gem is untranslated in mid-late game) but it's easy enough to read and understand what's happening and enjoy. Difficulty feels just right and it seems that we can progress the girls' levels indefinitely although I'd love to see a new game plus sort of mode in a future version.Hell Girls has all the markings of solid game design; it emphasizes playstyle variety while tackling the match 3 genre with the added bonus of roleplaying elements and a light story with a few interesting things to say about life."

But i know you didn't buy this game for achievements, get the patch already.Oh yeah, most of the picture on the gallery will only reveals after you reach the second map, so yeah, pretty annoying if you are a pervert lol."

Very enjoyable RPG elements such as gearing up your girls, leveling them and getting different spells to help you fight the monsters.Music is enjoyable, girls making sounds when getting hit is stranglely.. pleasant.Achievements are easy to obtain.Everything is just really nice and casual. Would 100% recommend if you've got time to kill!Would rate this 9/10 for what it is and is supposed to be."
