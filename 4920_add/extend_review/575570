It is fun, I will give it that, for a little while. It feels good and is difficult in a good way.Now onto the parts I dislike... I think the minigame part is ridiculous, it does not fit the game in any way, like trying to put a corner piece of a puzzle in the center, it just doesn't fit, I appreciate the devs allowing you to remove this.They also have too little things and actions, why can't I fill an empty bottle with snow and boil it? Why are the only foods you can find sandwitches and chocolate bars? Why are there no water bottles, only juice? The devs act like this is a finished game, when it is only a skeleton.There is no way to see how your score adds up, my first game I got a thousand points, only lasting two days, another I last five or six and only get two hundred more points than that. I then see this guy with three thousand on the leaderboard, and have no way of knowing how many days he lasted, it is a disfunctional scoring system when you ahve no idea how the points add up, giving you no way to compare it with other people.All in all, a fun little game, I'd price it at five to eight dollars in its current state. If the devs update it regularly and flesh the game out more, I might be able to recomend it, but until I see improvement, I cannot."

I kinda just want the nightmare stuff right now lol. When the game gets more content then my review may change but as for now it needs a lot more work."

,Not Recommended,575570,31792259,Posted: 16 May,all,32.33 repeating of course,It's a cute game with some interesting mechanics but it just doesn't make any sense.Why are sandwiches and batteries buried in snow mounds on these ice islands?It's more of a weird dream than a game.
76561198045411208,Not Recommended,575570,33842998,Posted: 27 July,all,minndawg,I can't believe I paid $13 for this...Get the demo and save your money. Great concept and was fun for about 15m but the dev said that's all you're getting out of this game. They thought about a desert skinned version but no.For $13 there are so many other games you can get and you'll get more than half an hour of entertainment out of them.If this game were $5 I would recommend.

The game itself was amazing, the soundtrack for the Snowball fight was amazing. The Survival aspect was okay. Gave me chills when I found the remains of my predecessors, Once again. Amazing Game."

,Recommended,575570,31814562,Posted: 17 May,all,Unidentified,"Honestly i love the game ad i cant wait to see what they do with it.I hope they add a little more detail on how to get rescued.. i used both flares at the start of a day and nothing happent, I lasted 6-7 days ad by the 5th i was running completely out of food and juice ad barely strugling to get more that 6th and 7th day literally maybe took 5 min because there was no more food or water. Hopefully they add a way to boil snow ad make fishing a bit more reliable-the runing away from the boat minigame i always get and iv never been able to beat it.. i think the last jump is a little too big.However all in all i think its a great game so far and cat wait for them to add new stuff"
76561198006556273,Recommended,575570,31771909,Posted: 15 May,all,Corkell,"So I picked up this game when it came out ... a huge fan of these sorta of games. From the first hour-ish of playing I can tell you that this game does not hold your hand in anyway. Its really..really hard! You will die and you will die over and over!The stove wouldn't go on, spent the night in the dark because torches are somehow hard to work and died alone while cooking my only fish I got from the worlds smallest hole.10/10 would play cooking sim again!I did a review of this game on the following link.. WARNING strong languagehttps://youtu.be/Jd5Lwu2hJUI"
,Recommended,575570,31779054,Posted: 15 May,all,Byzanoid,"Survived well for a while, got into a rough spot though. I was shoving snow in my face just outside my tent as I started to hear an odd sound. A helicopter! I stood up and turned to rush to the tent for the flage gun cartige. Then I fainted.That feeling after waking up, the absence of the beating blades. Nearly dead of dehydration. No strength to go out scavenging...10/10 would get my soul crushed again.A nice game with a lot of potential I hope is realized. Whether you have the nightmares on, or off, it is challenging in what you're willing to go through to survive. I'd like to see more survival options implemented, such as special tools to make survival a little easier late in the game, especially a findable pot to melt and boil snow in.In the future, I'd also like to see the ice changing every day, even by a little. The path you took to that dead fisherman the day before is no longer there now, and you must find a different way.One thing I would not like to see out of this game is the main character reaching Land. This is survival on the ice, and should remain that way, and be developed to expand upon that.Currently things feel very finite. There's only so many bottles of juice and cans of gas on your ice flow. In many ways this is really part of the game, to eek it out until you can get a signal out so you can be saved. However I feel that if the player really puts a lot of effort into it, they should be able to survive indefinitely.On a final note, if you're thinking of getting this, Get It.It's a wonderful experience made by people who have put a lot of hard work and passion into this project to give us the uncommon experience of a stranded ice-fisherman. Fresh, new, fun, and unexpected."
