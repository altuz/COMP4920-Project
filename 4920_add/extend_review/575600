However slow reload, only locomotion being teleportation and the fact you have to use buttons to change weapons instead of reaching for them at your side takes away from how awesome it really could be."
76561198020445786,Not Recommended,575600,31758153,Posted: 14 May,all,M1ng0J1ng0,"5.9 out of 10I'm finding this difficult game to enjoy. The game has the right ideas in principle, but the overall polish in the production is lacking in many parts and it drags it as a whole down. For example, the weapons feel limp and stiff animations are not convincing.VR can boost the enjoyment of average games significantly; if this was played on a monitor, the reviews would be mostly negative. It's just an okay VR game right now, but has the foundation of something good if the developers can realise it's full potential.I also struggled in multiplayer, the ping was fine but the game lagged terribly. I could see the other players moving around normally, but the zombies stuttered around, many stuck like statues. Couldn't tell which were targets or bugged. Big shame as I feel the coop is where it's most enjoyable, the single player experience gets dull after a while.Why bother with this when Arizona Sunshine exists?"

It has a few rough edges, and lacks overall content, but the experience it offers is second to none at this current point in time. To say it borrows inspiration from certain other FPS titles *cough* COD *cough* would be an understatement of epic proportions; however this game still manages to feel envigoratingly fresh, due in large to the fact that it is VR. If you've got £11, a vive, and a hefty PC you just can't go wrong. I can definitely see myself playing this for at least the next couple of weeks, levelling up, and unlocking all the perks. And providing the developers continue to add more maps, weapons and a revival notification (also please reduce the revive time to 1 roiund instead of 2) I will continue to play. I know there's a new map coming soon, and I eagerly anticipate decapitating some zeds in it. What more can I say, for the price of a five guys burger you can have hours of VR fun; buy it now!"

I couldn't play at first but the developers had fixed it very quickly.Still needs a bit of work but I can see it getting a lot better. I wholly recommend it."
,Not Recommended,575600,32131660,Posted: 2 June,all,Spoiler Alert,"It's Zombie mode in Call of Duty, in VR.If you enjoy COD zombies, you'll like this.If you think zombie games are now overplayed and stupid, you won't.I fall under category B (but Arizona Sunshine wins top marks!)This is not Arizona Sunshine.This is stand in a room, build barricades, and survive boring wave after wave.If you like Zombies, snag it. If you don't, avoid it."
,Recommended,575600,30040285,Posted: 19 February,all,HUNK,"Honestly the game is pretty decent it runs well but the whole point of this kind of styled game is just ruined , the multiplayer is a ghost town from what I'm assuming considering that the Join Game button doesn't do anything.You can create sessions but that's no fun if there's nobody to invite and nobody to discover either.I mean you could buy it , but if you're looking to play with other people i'd probably be a little iffy on this one."
,Not Recommended,575600,31733573,Posted: 13 May,all,STEREO,"Did not like this game at all.  Teleport only?  Yea, that's a mistake.  Weapons feel stupid all around, from the angle they sit at, to the rates of fire, to the ridiculously slow and lazy reloading ""mechanics"" (single button press).  This game is just trying to rip off COD Zombies and did a pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥job of it, except that they hit the mark with the stupid aspects of COD-Z, like making headshots not count for♥♥♥♥♥♥ having a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ money system, and giving stupidly low amounts of ammo."

76561198124516461,Recommended,575600,30062716,Posted: 20 February,all,bigtroy1114,This is the first Vr game in my opinion that really gives me that cod zombies feel.Needs better graphics optimization and a few fixes but it's in EA so that's to be expected.I say buy this game if you like killing zombies and want to help build the player base for a multiplayer zombie game that has alot of potential.
,Not Recommended,575600,30956308,Posted: 4 April,all,GamezFreakHD,"Okay, I'm not going to go into depth in this review I am just going to get streight to the point, 2017 VR Online is nothing special. When I 1st played this game I could not even get the games audio to work. Just to add insult to injury everytime I attempted to start &/or join an online game (If you can even find any) the game would just freeze then crash, which pi*sed me off big time.This is all I am going to say about this, it's not worth $19.99 by no means. It should be 75% cheaper! Then It would be one of those games you pick up for yourself and your friends just to go mess around in..On to the gameplay side of things, the game uses the normal teleport based movement you see in most VR titles, Then zombies start to spawn and break down your barricades as you defend yourself. That's it. Nothing more. Not to mention you can shoot AK's & shotguns with one hand..If you want a good, fun & awesome single player or CO-OP VR zombie game take a look at Arizona Sunshine. That game has a CO-OP story mode plus a wave based survival mode as well. Yeah, it's more expensive than this but you're getting a quality game. So, yeah 2017 VR Online is not worth it."

Simple zombie defense with barriers that can be rebuilt.As of now, they have updated the game for Oculus controls, so you will see the controller textures in game now as well as have them aligned properly.Solid experience, always wish for more content, and I hope the devs deliver as this game grows to be better and better!"

,Recommended,575600,30214372,Posted: 26 February,all,Apollo,"So this game has a great potential to be an awesome game.Pros:Love the co-op so far very fun.ZOMBIES!, Yeah this is a pro no matter what.Forgot is how fast the developers add stuff and fix things super pro in my book.Cons:I would love the option to do manual reloading if I want to, one of the best parts of having VR.Maybe allow the purchasing of ammo for the weapons you only get randomly so you can keep them longer.Gas canisters should only be a one shot explosion not 4 shots...Also it takes way too long to level up, I mean I did 5 matches and am a sliver from level 2, if it takes this long at low levels I don't even want to imagine the higher levels.Would love to have the ability to change the angle of the gun up and down, at the moment feels like the gun when holding the controller the right way feels like it's leaning more towards the ground than straight on.I'm switching my review to recommended because of how quickly the developers adjusted the problem with accuracy I was having rather than just saying it was me like everyone else. I will admit when it's my accuracy problem rather than just blaming the game...Thanks for being awesome guys and fixing things people are having problems with!"
,Recommended,575600,29997730,Posted: 17 February,all,Skyguy,"This'll be the first actual review of the game [original not recommended due to the game not functioning], so here's what I've taken from it.What I've been wanting for a while was a VR COD-Zombie-esque game, and this is exactly what this game is. It's not exactly special in any way--not too much polish, graphics are all right, and the gameplay is there. But if you're looking for a game like Nazi Zombies and a bit of fun, this game won't disappoint.However, there are a few flaws. This includes poor translation to English [though it's about understandable], obviously some glitches, small map [only one because the second map won't let you play it], and weapons feel somewhat ""odd.""It's good, and I recommend it at this state for a little bit of fun."

,Not Recommended,575600,31010430,Posted: 7 April,all,Caindris,Half the settings don't do anything when clicked.  Microphone chat never works and it seems to capture all open mics so you can't even use an external program (steam chat) to voice chat if you wanted to.  Zombies randomly teleport.  Bullet dynamics seem to have a mind of their own.  Could also stand to have something of a tutorial.

The graphics are great , didnt have any bugs when me and the wife played it .. Didint play on multiplayer (couldnt find any player)  my guess is the game is to new and there isnt alot of players yet.Final thoughts::If you are thinking of getting this game , buy it now!! at $14.99  because I promise you in a week or two, this game is going to be $39.99 .I bought Arizona Sunshine for $19.99 , three weeks later it was $40"

,Not Recommended,575600,35253043,Posted: 27 September,all,23Link89,"In mediocrity could be a VR game, this would be it. Little to none of any of the content used is orignal. Nevermind good. The game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ especially when there are a lot of zombies, the map designs are laughably bad. Zero room for movement, they do not expand any furthur, so what you see it what you get. The UI is horrible, the controls feel unresponsive, especially in press mode. Movement is also controlled by where you look meaning you can't use where your controller looks instead which makes strafing and firing a nightmare.On top of that the game looks like ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ the textures are laughably blurry, (This is on high settings aswell) with the color pallete equivalent to that of my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The gunplay is awful as well, the only thing you do is fire, THAT'S IT. You press buttons and the game does everything for you, now I can understand the pistols and the rifiles, they can be unintuitive to some people. BUT THE ♥♥♥♥ING SHOTGUNS? REALLY? You can't pump them, despite showing it in the animation, you can't open the double barrel break secondary. Not to mention most of the weapons are pretty generic, and limited. You are limited to (Least from what I've gotten from the box) two pistols and a revolver, a auto sniper, a regular sniper, a flame thrower, and like 3 different shotguns. That's it.Look, I had hopes for this game, I cut it some slack back in 2017 mostly because it's a 'proof of concept', a year later and the game still has enormous amounts of bugs instability issues blandness and boring gameplay."
