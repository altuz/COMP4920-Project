Now teleport through the dark portal and witness the end!”“Find all hidden treasures” = “Nice observation, how about a hearty handshake?”“Win the Civil War scenario playing a the Confederates” = “I missed that day in history class XD”“Beat the game without dying or loading from a savefile” = “You truly mastered the game, grats!”Let’s see what ZUP 3 has to offer:“A” = “You want achievements? Gimme your money!”“A” = “You want achievements? Gimme your money!”“A” = “You want achievements? Gimme your money!”“A” = “You want achievements? Gimme your money!”“A” = “You want achievements? Gimme your money!”“A” = “You want achievements? Gimme your money!”“A” = “You want achievements? Gimme your money!”“A!” = “You want more achievements? Vote for me on greenlight!”“A!” = “You want more achievements? Vote for me on greenlight!”“A!” = “You want more achievements? Vote for me on greenlight!”“A!” = “You want more achievements? Vote for me on greenlight!”“A!” = “You want more achievements? Vote for me on greenlight!”“A!” = “You want more achievements? Vote for me on greenlight!”“A!” = “You want more achievements? Vote for me on greenlight!”…….Besides repeating the same thing over and over 7 times, it’s so sad to make easy money by selling achievements.But that’s only a glimpse of the sadness iceberg, what’s truly sad are those achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s who support ZUP with all their heart.I don’t refuse games with tons of achievements. On the contrary, Isaac & Gemcraft are my favorite games, and they have 758 achievements combined. While Isaac can easily offer 200 hours of enjoyment, ZUP gets repetitive after a cup of tea. Without enough content and gameplay to support the achievements, they are dumb and meaningless.Had to idle the game for 5 minutes in order to write a review, I wish I'd never gain a single achievement from this crap, but 14 achievements popped up upon opening the game. Hope I can warn others with my words.I know some achievement hunters bought ZUP just because of peer pressure: lots of friends gained 2000 achievements from the series, and I have none.Well, it’s okay. Nobody will think less of you, just because you didn’t buy ZUP.If you loathe ZUP just as I do, instead of joining the lemon party and dance towards the seductive booty of braindead achievements, it’s better to give ZUP 4 a negative vote on greenlight and let it never be released."

Where I like some easy achievement games from time to time, putting over 1700 achievements in one game with the playtime of not more than 1 hour is simply a slap into the face of every honest achievement hunter on Steam.

,Recommended,575640,31998810,Posted: 27 May,all,Blanchflower,"This is the 3rd game of the Zup! series. It is popular among achievement hunters due to the sheer number of achievements and fairly easy to obtain all of them.At the time of this review, I have already played the 1st 2 games of this series. By far, this game is a little bit harder than the previous 2 but it is still possible to obtain all of the 1,708 achievements within 2 hours. This is a puzzle game which provides a fair bit of challenge at the latter levels. As usual, the developers have made a great effort in releasing a bug-free game (a rarity among modern games) and all the achievements are working and in order as the previous 2 games. The physics of this game is superb by the way.I highly recommend this game to the hardcore achievement hunters as well as for casual gamers. This game is also highly suitable for young children."

,Not Recommended,575640,29292923,Posted: 16 January,all,alex.n.gregory,"108 minutes played. In that time, I obtained more than 1700 achievements. We're through the looking glass here, folks.As much as I enjoyedZup!andZup! 2(a deceptively-simple pair of puzzle games that have you clicking on explosive red blocks in order to get a blue block over to a green platform and unlock the next stage), this third installment is already pushing the limits of what I'm willing to tolerate. I considered the DLC for the second game a neat little bonus, but it's as if the developers saw how much people were playing their little title and decided to go all post-modern and edgy on their player base.You can't start this game for the first time without getting 20 achievements. Click on anything on the screen, another 3-6 achievements. There are so many achievement messages coming on-screen at once that it actually messes with the flow of the game in certain situations, by making it so that you either have to wait or click through the achievements in order to activate the exit gate.And that's not even getting into the game itself, whose sole innovation this time is that the item you have to get into the green ""safe"" area is now a ball instead of a square, and there are white tiles you have to click on in later levels in order to make them vanish and solve certain puzzles. Couldn't this have just been produced as an add-on for the previous title?I'm not sure who this game was intended for. The achievement symbols themselves are noticeably less polished and refined than the ones from the original game (which look very nice in an achievement showcase, similar to howLYNEhad its set of achievements). There's no real innovation or unique designs on display here other than a reliance in the later levels of using ""step"" tiles to roll the ball into certain areas. The achievements feel like a giant joke that was designed to undermine and trivialize Steam's achievement system.You're better off sticking with the first two games and not wasting your time on this unless you're desperate for more achievements. Even then, the sheer absurdity of the way achievements are integrated with the game is off-putting."

,Recommended,575640,29301849,Posted: 16 January,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Zup! 3is a great way to diminish the efforts of people that, in my opinion, waste their time trying to simply increase the total number of achievements they have on Steam.Because, let's face it, at the end of the day it's just a money game, right? Plus you are suffering through some pretty crappy titles in this race, too. And who wins?Honestly, I'd like to fund a game where you get one million achievements for simply clicking 'start'.I'm driven by achievements within games, but certainly not total amounts within Steam.I get that Steam in itself can be a game, but don't you feel at that point that you are just being tricked by marketing?I *love* Steam. In some ways, I'm a Steam fanboy, but I generally know when I'm being duped. Yeah, I spent some money on cards from time-to-time, but I am aware of its stupidity and feel dumb about it. I should also note, that the money I spend is generally 'pocket change' and certainly not substantial.Again, these are my opinions,but if you get the feeling you are running a race that can be won with money, everyone is likely to lose (except whoever is selling to you).===Beyond the elephant-in-the-room achievement novelty,Zup! 3is actually a cute little puzzle game.I've played worse, for much more money."

He setup some multiplicator for each single achievement to 14x and for levels 7x. Since Steam can only show 3 newly popped achievements you have to wait for Steam until you can finally play the game behind this big mess. Even if you get rewarded with 1700 achievements in the end. More achievements doesn't mean more fun. That's a fact you can learn after playing this game. And there aren't either way more levels than in the previous ZUP games. So to speak it's rather like a Steam social experiment."

,Recommended,575640,29215136,Posted: 12 January,all,C̮̥̥͋o͚̖͛ẅ͖̭̜̑̏++,"The third instalment of the Zup! franchise takes what is loved about the previous two games, and turns it up to 11, or 1708 in the case of the number of achievements. Nothing noteworthy has been added; the overall difficulty is slightly increased, and in a few of the later levels there are two blue blocks instead of one, but the gameplay is essentially unchanged.The main attraction is once again the achievements, with over seven times the amount found in Zup! 2. Each level gives at least 14 (seven from opening, and another seven for beating it), and there are a few hidden ones along the way. Some levels require somewhat precise timing to clear, but the game can still be completed in under an hour. There is also no reason to replay a level unless you want to figure out an alternative way of clearing.The game can probably stand on its own merits, but is clearly targeted at achievement hunters. Concerns about devaluing achievements aside, this has started a trend of cheap games with a massive number of achievements to make a sale. I'm unsure what kind of problems this will lead to in the near future.Ultimately, Zup! 3 is at least still a game, and should still be worth a look if you know what the game is about."

With such an insane boost to any collector’s count, and at such a low cost, this game is pretty much an insta-buy. I can probably guarantee that 80% of the people checking the reviews right now are just wondering how easy and how long it will take to get them all. The answer is: super easy, and most likely under an hour (upwards to 2 hours depending on skill).Those Missing AchievementsIn fact, the achievements are so easy to get, there are probably only a handful of moments where there wasn’t an achievement getting unlocked. With 77 levels to play through, the achievement requirements basically include: opening/beating all levels, clicking anywhere, restarting levels, and finding specific symbols/shapes “hidden” (in plain sight) throughout the levels. The Discussions are starting to get flooded with questions of missing achievements.Hint: some of the symbols are obvious, some will require some ""needless"" exploding.Hint 2: take another look around levels: F, L, S, 2, <, [.What About the Game?Regarding the gameplay, I’ve actually found it to be somewhat enjoyable, much more than other cheap cash grabs on Steam, but something expected for a single dollar title. This physics based puzzle game revolves around clicking explosion blocks to propel hardened blocks/ball(s) to a goal platform. The physics is oddly satisfying, since there is an order to the madness. Blocks will magically land in such a way (skewed, angled, stacked, blocked, etc.) to get the ball to the goal. Most of the levels do require a little bit of timing, so it isn't just a monotonous slog, but there isn’t anything real challenging here. There are definitely a few cheeky levels thrown in there for the dev to have some fun too.Complete Walkthroughhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWAd5_sO-5IBefore You Buy– analyses of newly released indie games"

The new clickable white boxes didn't really add much depth to things, only small annoyances that left for way too many retries.As far as difficulty goes, the game has a steeper curve than the previous two installments, but again, I feel like it's for the wrong reasons.

Общая мысль такова: это просто не мой жанр игр. В игре не было багов или каких-то откровенных глупостей, не было пошлости или жестокости, но не было и особого смысла. Слава Богу, что ее можно пройти всего за час (+2 часа на карточки, как вы можете видеть по времени, что я провела в игре), иначе я бы сошла с ума от скуки. Геймплей жутко однообразный. Взорви блок, заставь мячик двигаться, понаблюдай, как он двигается и останавливается на зеленой платформе, кликни на дверь, перейди на следующий уровень. Вот, вроде бы, и все. Все-таки я ожидала более интересные задачки, а предложенные мне уровни были удивительно легкими.Игра на один раз или для любителей легких ачивок, ни более, ни менее. Лично мне не интересно тратить время на что-то подобное (то же относится и к кликерам), но и бросать вещи на полпути я тоже не могу, поэтому пришлось пройти все до конца. Стоило ли оно того? Ну, учитывая, что я потратила на всю игру всего 1 час, то жить можно. Однако, я не могу дать положительный отзыв игре, которая мне не доставила ни капельки удовольствия от ее прохождения. Одним словом, жаль, что в Steam нет нейтральной оценки. Окончательный вердикт: ничего особенного. Игра на любителя.Я очень надеюсь, что мое мнение никого не обидело. Я не преследовала цели унизить поклонников данных игр или смешать с грязью сам жанр. Просто так сложилось, что мне не нравятся подобные произведения и я не вижу причины это скрывать.Chu~This is going to be one of my shortest reviews. And there is a good reason for this – there is not much to talk about. I cannot say that the game is bad, no, but the good parts of it are not worth a positive review. I wish there was a neutral mark, but, unfortunately, Steam sees everything in blue and red only.However, I should also mention that this type of games is just not my genre. I like neither clickers nor short plotless games like this. What is the main idea of Zup? Bring the ball to the green platform. Repeat 50 times. Get 1000+ achievements. I hoped for some kind of challenge, but there is none.Sorry, this is not what I like in games. I gave it a try but that is it. I do not think I will play any other games of this series. They are too simple, too repetitive, in my humble opinion. It does not mean they are bad! It is just not my cup of soup. For this reason, I just cannot give it a positive review even though there were no bugs or obviously unpleasant moments like violence or nudity.I hope fans of this game will understand my point of view and will not be offended."

,Recommended,575640,29468625,Posted: 24 January,all,JacquesLeSauve,"Zup! 3 is everything that you'll find in theprevious gamebut this time with the added novelty of having almost two-thousand achievements to unlock - easy ones, too, the kind you'll get mostly just by playing the game. I think the justification for this is that they can be used for display on players' profile pages.So, for example, when you complete the A stage you'll be awarded several ""A"" achievements of various colours so you have a choice when it comes to showcasing naughty words on your page. But I personally think that's all beside the point; it's there to enjoy or ignore as you please. But I think the real issue with Zup! 3 is that Zup! 2 exists... You just can't recapture that same magic by merely repeating the same trick twice.While the second in the series felt like an evolution of the idea and brought some fun challenge along with it, this really feels like more of the same without adding much new (not massively surprising given the quick turnaround of all three games). In fact, many stages feel like rethreads of levels from the last game. At one point near the end it threatens to get exciting when it introduces two balls to deal with instead of one. But this is quickly abandoned after a few levels before reverting to type.Again, as with the previous entries, this is a solid, enjoyable game, and it even lasts longer than the others, too, clocking in at maybe thirty to forty minutes this time. But I can't help but feel a little disappointed that it's merely an extension of the old without ringing in the new. In the event a fourth game is ever released, I hope they just go wild and throw everything at us. Then we'll have something to get excited about."

This is utterly ridiculous, most of the time, you get something like 12 or 14 achievements with a single click.Was this necessary ? No. Is it enjoyable ? No (there are so many achievements that they usually lag behind what you're actually doing). The puzzles are still of the same kind, easy but enjoyable for a short time, that's the only good point.200 or 300 achievements would have been fine, we're way overboard here, but if that's what you're after, why not after all ? You'll get them in roughly 1 or 2 hours."

The puzzles are relatively straightforward and well designed. Some may catch you out a little here and there but for the most part they're not very tasking and you can complete any of the games in under an hour.This game did exactly what I wanted (gave me lots of cool achievements to decorate with) and wasn't a chore to play so would recommned highly to gamers with similar intentions. If you're actually looking for a challenging puzzle game however then there are probably better ones on the market.

In only an hour you can earn 1708 achievements and 100% the game and for the price of 1$ you can't beat that at all.  The game itself is fairly fun, which is why I choose to recommend this title, however the amount of achievements is slightly absurd.  The first two games have a lot of achievements but not even a fraction of what Zup 3 contains.  In my personal opinion this game just has too many achievements, with each action and level giving you 5 or so achievements.  The game is a great way to bring your achievement number up, but I'd recommend just sticking with Zup 1 and 2."

Whilst most puzzles are very simple, the physics and timing involved do afford for some variety--and I have found that several puzzles have alternative solutions (random chance not withstanding).The vast number of achievements is a bit of a stretch, however, some of the logic behind this can be in the graphics of said achievements: All Zup! game achievements are essentially emotes. Steam users can use those achievements to add additional personalisation to their profiles (spelling out their user names perhaps etc.).Overall, the Zup! series makes for an enjoyable diversion--a diversion which has greater depth than the achievements afforded by Zup! 3."

Zup and it's predecessors are casual puzzles games where you have to blow up red cubes and get a blue sphere to land on a green platform. What separates this game from most other puzzle games are the huge chunk of achievements you can get just by doing simple things like clicking icons on the main menu with multiples of the same thing with this game in particular. This had lead to some criticism in that over 1700 achievements earned in such a short time is a bit of an insult to the many hunters out there who worked hard to get the amount they have right now. Here's my standpoint on the situation.Pros- Simple easy to play puzzle game good for relaxing to.- Short game which can be beat in less than an hour.- Very creative levels, some are fun to watch.- Easy achievements.Cons- Some levels are more tricky than others.- I feel there are just too many achievements (I even feel a little spoiled by it)If you want a relaxing puzzle game and earn tons of achievements I say go ahead and get it but if don't want to cause it's demeaning to achievements hunters than don't it's all up to you."

Out of 70 levels only 5 or 6 were more difficult and forced to think to solve the puzzle. And these 5 or 6 were not the last ones, more towards the middle. In general the game seemed too easy and too short. I completed it in around 1 hour 20 minutes, while playing at quite slow pace. Next thing was that game lacked polishing, as some levels seemed just as done in few minutes, i respect indie game developers, but if you release final game, put some effort guys! I know the game is 1Euro, but still :)To sum up:Pros: Innovative gameplay, great physics, good priceCons: Short (less than 90 min to complete), repetitive, too easy even at the end, not visually polished.Thanks!"

,Recommended,575640,29321873,Posted: 17 January,all,dalieni,"So here we are. The legendary Zup! trilogy comes to an end. I have played the previous two and this one didn't do anything too wild or new. There were a few levels with cool new mechanics. Sadly these new mechanics only lasted those few levels, not to be seen anymore in the game.So what is Zup you might ask. Quickly summarized, Zup is a really short (20-40 minutes) and really cheap puzzleish game. You click some boxes and try to guide your little ball into green area. That's all that there is to it really. Now the real catch of the game is usually the hundreds of achievements that you get playing the game. These achievements are like letters, numbers etc to customize your profile with. Zup! 3 includes 1708 achievements. It's a bit of an overkill to be real and sadly the achievements in this entry are really bland looking. Yeah you get your different color alphabet and numbers but that's it really. Atleast in the previous entry you got a damn Gabe Newells face to make your steam profile shine.In summary, it's an ok game for under a buck. You have a little bit of fun, you get a bunch of achievements to customize your profile with and that's it."
,Recommended,575640,29330993,Posted: 17 January,all,Sinful Sorcerer,"This is what I had to say about the first Zup!:""To be enirely honest, I went into this with very low expectations. This was mostly due to my prior experiences with Super Duper Flying Genocide 2017, another recent title that markets itself in a similar fashion. ""Short, Simple, Earn loads of achievements"". And I'd be lying if I said this game is perfect, but I have to give praise where praise is due. This game really surprised me!The very first distinction I'd like to make between this and Super Duper Flying Genocide 2017 is that unlike that dissappointment, I would actually consider this a game and a rather enjoyable and intuitive one at that! It is clear that Zup! goes for the same demographic; achievement hunters, completionists, whatever you want to call them. I consider myself part of that group, so I felt inclined to give this game a try despite my rather low expectations. Very much like the building blocks that you interact with in Zup! my expectations were blown away! This is definitely a puzzle game first and foremost, and an achievement treasure second.Your objective is to bring the blue square onto the green tiles through the use of explosions. The red squares are explosive and clicking them will make them blow up, knocking any yellow and blue squares away in the process. It really is as simple as that. But just because the mechanics are simple it doesn't necessarely mean that the game itself is easy, in fact I'd say far from it.The levels start out easy enough, and for the first few levels it feels like this might have actually been a bad choice after all, just another cash grab copy paste job with loads of achievements attached, but then you reach level 10 and things start to get interesting. As you progress through the game each level becomes more and more challenging and you need to both think of the right solution and make use of your reflexes and predictions to launch the blue square with the right trajectory and force to get it where it needs to be.Soon I had forgotten about my prior pessimism and was instead joyfully exploring in how many ways I could try to knock the yellow block-towers down and with what sort of speed I could send the blue square flying in order to solve the puzzle in front of me. The simple yet addictive nature of the game had caught me entirely off guard and I was getting more and more intrigued and hopeful for the next challenge the game would provide me with...And then it ended. Just like that.If anything, that would be my only real gripe with the title, it is extremely short. I beat the whole thing with 100% achivements in only a couple of minutes, and I wish it would go on for a bit longer as I was actually having quite a bit of fun with it. But to be fair the game has a very low price point and the tags do describe it as ""short"" so I should have been expecting it to end rather quickly.All that said, I hope you understand my thoughts about this game but in case I was too lengthy in my description of it and the enjoyment it gave me let me try to sum it up in a few short words:This is a short but fun and intuitive physics puzzle game. I had a lot of fun with it and the achievements are a bonus rather than the main focus. I recommend this highly if you want some quick fun, and I suggest you pick up the Zup-Zup! Bundle which hosts all three games for a very affordable price. I have not yet played the other two titles, but if they are anywhere as good as this then I cannot recommend it enough.""After playing the two sequels I can happily say that they are worthy successors. If you liked the first two games, you are going to like this. If you did not, you won't find anything different here. It's the same concept with more levels, more achievements and more Zup!One thing this one tries to innovate with is the introduction of white blocks that you can remove by clicking on them. These give further depth and variation to the levels, but unfortunately come with the downside of making things feel a bit more trial and error. Some levels can feature ten+ white blocks in a row, and the smallest variation in which blocks are removed can completely change the outcome of the level. I felt the will to innovate was welcome, but sadly I believe this to be the least enjoyable of the three games as the white blocks took away from the game's simplistic but challenging and fair nature, and put it closer to the concept of ""repeat until you succeed"".None the less, this is still a very nice simplistic puzzle game for a very affordable price. I recommend you check out the first two, and if you like them, then come back and play this afterwards."
