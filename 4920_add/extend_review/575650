I think that for a casual game/visual novel, this one did a nice job. Also, the art quality and user interface are pretty nice!If you want a quick experience, this short VN might be for you. Just be aware that all the routes have some insane plot twists, lol.8/10, I really want another game like this one, but longer."

,Recommended,575650,29072011,Posted: 6 January,all,ミントSupreme,"I've played this game on multiple platforms, so don't mind the play time.-------------------------------------------------------------If you don't like visual novels, this is not for you. It's short as well, so that is also something to keep in mind. The game plays with a lot of humor and inconsistencies (as in, the story changes as your choices do) if you've played the other paths, not something you would find in a lot of choice-based visual novels. The writing is pretty consistent, that is to say if you don't like it after about 20 minutes, you probably have the gist of things. Probably best to not go into this one taking it completely seriously.With that said, I for one like the writing, and especially the art style. I would generally say that the preview video and images for the most part sum things up quite nicely, although the game isn't exactly sexual in nature as some had assumed on the greenlight page. It's meant to be a cute little diversion into a world you help shape, so the narrative is based around that. For the price, you get a good amount of content. If a goofy little visual novel is your cuppa tea, go for it.Little known bonus fact: The developer of this game is actually a vegetable."

I think it made more sense as a free game, to be honest, but I bought it on sale and I'm not mad that I paid for it."

,Recommended,575650,30953546,Posted: 4 April,all,SilentCaay,"It's a cute little VN with 15 endings and each path takes about 1-2 minutes to complete so you're looking at less than an hour's worth of content. It's a bit unique in that your choices don't just change the path of the story but the origin and characters, as well. For example, if you pick a friendly choice then you're character might be a friendly person with friendly intentions but pick a creepy choice and your character is actually a creeper both at present and in backstory. It kind of makes the story ""lolsorandumXD"" since nothing is ever concrete but it's good for a few laughs.There are better things to spend $3 on but it's not like $3 is a lot. It's alright for what it is."

,Recommended,575650,29147357,Posted: 9 January,all,Gray,"This game is a good visual novel for both beginners and veterans of the genre. Beginners will like that it is cute and easy to navigate and doesn't feature any R18 content. Veterans will enjoy the funny storylines and twists around each new choice you make. I got a laugh out of some of the storylines, and enjoyed trying to get all the various endings. The price seems to mostly be about supporting the developer, and since the dev is nice and listens to bug reports and feature requests, I would advocate buying. If the price is too much, the game is currently free on mobile and giving them a good rating on there would still promote the dev's hard work.Pros: Cute artstyle, funny storylines, lots of endings, multiple clothing options for Lily.Cons: The game is simple and once you've unlocked all the endings and gotten the achievements there isn't much else to do in it."

,Recommended,575650,33269536,Posted: 5 July,all,Uradamus,"This's a really short game, less than 2 hours of content, but it still managed to be quite entertaining. One of the more impressive features was the music with 16 tracks that helped to really give each path its own unique feel. The story was quite enjoyable as well, always keeping me interested in seeing what the next ending would bring. The art was alright, a bit above average for your typical small indie VN. It fit the game fairly well and you can see most of it in the preview images above to decide if it's for you or not. There was also an interesting animation demo included where Lily would move her head around to follow a target you could move with your cursor that was rather well done, though it's just a shame they didn't manage to find some interesting way to incorporate it into the game somehow, maybe with cut scenes for the endings.Overall I would definitely recommend this if you are a fan of VNs, especially if you can catch it on a sale."

Only the mouse/touchpad click advances text, and my touchpad clicks very audibly.There's no need for a guide to get achievements; every combination of choices leads to a unique ending. Takes about half an hour to get all endings. It's about thirty minutes of cliches and stereotypes. It wasn't great or terrible. It was just average."

It’s actually brilliant the way different options make the story quite different.On one hand, it’s sad it’s so short, but on the other it’s actually a good thing, since it would end up being repetitive, and this way is just right.The true end is not my favorite, but it’s good on its own way."

The price is way too high for a VN that you can beat in about 30 minutes. I got through the game in 45 minutes getting all endings and all achievements. The game's choices make the game take HUGE turns into much different stories, and each story is equally amazing. Especially the true ending. The true ending was wayyyyyy out of the ball park. In one story I was a stalker, and in another, Lily was. And in one ending, you murder her, in another, you both become a murdering duo, and this is just a tiny fraction of what the game has to offer. TINY. (Each ending is like 3 minutes though) You should REALLY buy this game if you have the time and money, it's totally worth it. Please lower the price.(but i returned it because i need money lower the price to like 99 cents so i can afford the game"

76561198129411711,Recommended,575650,29259404,Posted: 14 January,all,Inconsistent Gamer,"InLily's Day Offyou play as an anonymous guy. You suddenly find yourself in some neighborhood where a teenage girl is crying. You recognize her as the famous pop idol singer Lilypad Lily, but she apparently has no memory of who she is. It is up to you to try to find out what is going on.This game is a type of visual novel. Unlike some other visual novels, this one is pure comedy. The game mechanic is a little different from regular visual novels in that your choices do not really direct the course of the story but rather dictate what the circumstances of the story are. In total, there are sixteen different endings that can be achieved.As a comedy game, the main thing here is the humor. I thought the humor worked well in this game and I got many laughs out of it. Much of the comedy comes from the various absurd directions the story can take. In one route you might be a stalker, but in a different route it might be thatLilyis the stalker. It all just feels so ridiculous that I cannot help but laugh.The other aspects of this game take a back seat to the jokes. The art is nice and colorful, even if it is rather limited. There is no save function, but it does not really present any problems as the game is so short. The short length of the game is really the only negative here. I was able to easily get 100% completion in just under an hour.Overall, as a comedy game, I thoughtLily's Day Offwas hilarious. At an asking price of $2.99, I think I got my money's worth considering the amount of laughs I got."

This game didn't appeal too much for me, because of the type of visual novels I enjoy to play. I'm not saying that it won't appeal to anyone. I think that there will be a lot of people into this game, such as those who want to play a very quick game and don't want to think too much. The stories to me were quick and to the point. I didn't really appreciate them as much, but I do believe that some people playing will be surprised with the outcomes. In terms of choices, I did like that there were several choices to choose from, but since each story was so short, I couldn't really get into it.The artwork is extremely cute though. Really enjoyed the artwork and the music complimented nicely. I personally didn't enjoy the text used in the game. Once again, these are my personal opinions, so it could be something that others like.There have been quite a bit of glitches on this game for me. When some of the text is going up, a giant black line will appear. I also have been dealing with the screen blinking black a few times, then going back to the actual picture. I do believe that this will be fixed in time though. Granted, I defeated the entire game under an hour and completed all the achievements, so really, I won't be playing anymore."

There is a skip text function that works sort of okay (it seems to stop every time there's an animation, even if the scene isn't over), but it really isn't all that big of a deal to just skim through the text. There is also a handy feature where a choice will gray out if you've done all the options that go along with that choice to help you keep track of what you've done.Overall, it's a short but quirky title with short pathways that range from odd to sort of fluffy to even a little spooky. It probably helps if you like visual novels in the first place- but personally I quite enjoyed my time spent with the game and I happily collected all of the endings (though I was happy to only stumble across the 'True Ending' path only near the very end of my playtime- I think you can just get that ending at any time, which I think might spoil the experience a little if you get it too early)."
