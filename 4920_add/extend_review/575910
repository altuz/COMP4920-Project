Why is this on Steam? There's nothing to do after the first minute of gameplay.Also, why the hell does money falling on you in a Trump Simulator cause damage? What the hell man, totally unrealistic."

,Not Recommended,575910,31310633,Posted: 22 April,all,Redbeard,"Trump Simulator 2017 is a very simplistic game, with very little to excite the mind. By all means buy it and try it if you want to; but only buy it when it's on special, because I doubt that most people would bother playing it for more than a few minutes (unless they just leave it running for a while, so as to get the Steam cards).This game might be worth 20 cents, but not much more."

,Not Recommended,575910,35324295,Posted: 29 September,all,djoxyk,"awful game. or should I call it mini-game? whole gameplay is what you see on screenshots and in trailer. 2 levels, 4 buttons to move, 2 actions to perform the whole time.My ZX Spectrum 30 years ago had better games than this ""game"".real shame we have to buy such things in 2017"
