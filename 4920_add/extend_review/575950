,Not Recommended,575950,31474505,Posted: 30 April,all,IAmPattyJack,"Blood Feed is a horrible game, there is no denying it. That being said it's far from the worst trash game I've ever played which is some sort of achievement probably.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uxpecP_0_kIf you are looking for any sort of competent game turn around immediately as Blood Feed offers nothing but as many assets as the developer could find along with some horde missions that throw everything at you in the most basic form possible.Even so, I actually enjoyed my time playing this game in some twisted way and the developer seems to have put actual effort into some parts of the game.I play and cover a lot of trash games. Usually they end up being a bought map with three enemies or include five minutes of gameplay.Blood Feed manages to at least offer customization options, mutators and a good variety of weapons to choose from. Even though most of this may be bought assets, it at least makes the game not a complete waste.The game barely works from every angle. The enemies get stuck, weapons are all extremely overpowered and the voiceover work is laughably atrocious in every way, but the developer seems to relish in that fact so much it almost makes the game enjoyable.While I have to give this a negative rating because the game as a whole is terrible, Blood Feed at least makes an attempt to do SOMETHING, which is more than I can say for all the other trash games I've played this year."

All the assets!There's no real point in playing this.You just... shoot bugs and other creatures, all of which arepresumablybought assets.It also took me, without me realizing, ~15 minutes or so to get all 3.000 achievements in the game.I did nothing special to get them, I just played a little of the campaign mode and when I realized that I promptly quit the game and made this review."

,Not Recommended,575950,32588949,Posted: 20 June,all,Szymas | Fan Isca,"I like all the products made by Racing Bros, due to the similarity to Serious Sam series, but... it's hard to call them ""games"". They're more like tech demos with plenty achievements, what makes them popular, but not good at all. The devs made some cool graphics and wrote funny plots for their products, buy did not care enough, to develop something, you can play longer than 1h. [refunded]"

Nothing new, nothing really memorable. Just a quick hundo and additional 3001 trivial achievements. If you want subtance, there's an experience system, but other than that this is nothing but bait for achievement hunters such as myself. Achievements!"
,Not Recommended,575950,33570379,Posted: 15 July,all,Blade,"Ridiculously bad game. It's a very generic arena shooter with generic weapons, environment, and enemies (most likely asset flips). Enemies are thrown together nonsensically, as in there will be spiders and demons and chicken raptors in the same wave. Wave options don't matter, either; you can set yourself to infinite health and infinite ammo from the New Game menu, yet you take damage and run out of bullets. What's the point of that screen if you won't even save our settings? Nothing is unlocked, since you start out with every weapon in your base camp.You can run through trees and other objects. I would be surprised that there's a flashlight and night and heat vision, but I'm sure they were included by default in whatever FPS maker these ""developers"" spent 2 hours creating this ""game"" on.There is no point to playing this, other than for the 3001 achievements and trading cards (protip: ASF). And achievements pop like hotcakes whenever you get a kill, so you waste 1.3GB of bandwidth downloading this game that it takes you 8 minutes to 100%.Please, don't make any more games."
,Not Recommended,575950,32676761,Posted: 23 June,all,Lamanus,Dev spam same games without any improvements. I think dev should upgrade the first one what he made not just make another. Otherwist there should be any improvement but I cannot find. There is no reason to buy this one except the number of achievements.

I feel like a real-life big game hunter while playing this game. I feel powerful. Whenever an achievement pops up, I got a like erect because I'm so excited to show my mother dearest what awards I have obtained today. I like it. Bought it for $1.50. Good for  laugh. Got money's worth. Nice"

Of course the graphical look isn't too great but the gameplay feels just good and I had no performance issues. Something I can not say about other early acces titles I played so far. And i guess i need 2000+fps for playing this amazing game. c:"
,Recommended,575950,31959651,Posted: 25 May,all,fretzur,"Good game so far.Things to point out;-RPG needs better splash damage, seems to only kill the NPC that the projectile hits when they're in a group.-Minimap needs to be scaled down and improved, looks like the NPC is right ontop of me when they are really 10 meters in front, sometimes dead NPC bodies show up on minimap.-Reduced on-screen damage art, too much.-Reduced NPC death animations, too much.-Simpler, easier to understand UI in all aspects of game. (In combat, main menu, escape menu, etc.)-Personally I would like to see more exotic dinosaur, reptile creatures instead of mainly insects.-I enjoy the firefight style gameplay, however needs another objective besides just killing. Maybe different objectives to complete for each level while killing?Overall enjoyed the game so far, developer seems very cool and is communicating with players. For $5 it's fun to try out and help them make it better."

76561197972469397,Not Recommended,575950,33664874,Posted: 19 July,all,bi204-1,"Huh, its okay, its not a horrible game, but its not a great game either.  It could use a bit more story and a bit more strategy.   I know they said it was supposed to be mindless, but it was a bit too mindless.  I thought it would be a bit more like Serious Sam.  I also beat the campaign mode, only for it to take me directly into survival mode, so it wasn't even clear to me that I had beaten it.  I wouldn't recomend this game even for the price, unless you're desperate for a new first person shooter.  I have played worse, but I've also played much better, even for the same price, or only slightly higher.  This could have been a much better game if the devoloper had only spent a few more months on it, adding new features, and gameplay mechanics.  Even adding the option to have subtitles would have made it a slightly better game.Update 7/19/2018 at 10pm,Oh and I forgot to mention that the mini map is not the most accurate and sometimes enemies just appear right in front of you, out of nowhere."
