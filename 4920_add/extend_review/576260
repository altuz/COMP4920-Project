Also, there is a stock exchange, and your decisions regarding buying and selling goods in the various ports will have a direct effect on share prices.  You can make big money investing in a company, supplying it with raw materials and selling their products.Countries may go to war, and issue contracts to spy on enemy territory, or transport troops or supplies, or they may undertake public works and require construction materials to be transported.  If you're on good terms with a country, you will be able to establish your own settlements in their borders, and these settlements provide you with free goods to sell or supply your own invested-in companies.  Companies will also issue contracts for supplies or transportation of their executives to other towns.  Towns will grow and establish new businesses as they are supplied with goods and these businesses will level up, increasing their productiviy and profitability.I'm a bit of a pacifist so I've played this with combat turned off, but it's an option.  You may be attacked by pirates if you have a valuable cargo, or you may choose to play conquest mode and attack your competitors ships in an effort to bankrupt them. Combat is a hexgrid turn based easy to understand system.There's been some criticism of the random gen maps, but I actually think they work quite well for this kind of game, and offer more replayability than other similar trading games.  Each one is different, wih countries, goods production, and investment opportunities changing with each new map.  There are even jumbo maps now for those that want them. I think this is much better than either Port Royale or Patrician, which had fixed maps, towns  and production and therefore less replayability.Altogether, this is a great game, with a realistic economy; atmospheric music; authentic looking ships that react to the wind direction; lots of variety of goods, types of businesses, investment opportunities; the option to turn off combat, or enable unlockable features, being contracts, loans, stock exchange and settlements from the start of the game; the ability to play as a trader, privateer, smuggler or investor; and lots of replayability.I look forward to playing more, and recommend it highly to anyone interested in trading games."

In the beginning I started to go back and forth between an handful of cities just to win little money sometimes and lost it most of the time.Then I started to check the news, pay attention to the hints and research some more on the market prices and other extra info. That's when the missions became available and it added just another thing to consider when travelling between cities too far away. At this point I'm pretty sure I'm still far for having exhausted all the features from the game :)These are the things I liked the most so far:The gameplay it's really hooking once you get to understand the mechanics of the gameThe graphics are really nice, some details are missing but overall it's a good experience to watchMusic does its job pretty well, never getting bothering and playing well with the ambient soundsThere are some cons, thoughThere should be a little tutorial, I have to confess that it took me a couple of minutes to understand how to move the shipThe gameplay can have some slowdowns on a 4k display with a Geforce 860M board on a laptop when using that resolution, which makes sense but it's worth noticing"
76561198006524453,Not Recommended,576260,29913915,Posted: 13 February,all,Hassie54,"Ok, so I got this game, when I read that excerpt that said. . .""Winds Of Trade is a strategy game about running an ocean trading company in the 18th and 19th centuries.""I was really excited. I thought this game was going to be exactly what the doctor ordered. It looked like a fun, well thought out, simple and yet somewhat deep trading econ game. I read the 18th and 19th centuries, and thought that was wonderful. That is when the whole world was open for trading. You had ships going from the East Indies to America, and from Europe to South America, and EVERYTHING in between. What a WONDERFUL era to have a trading game, in this style, where you can create a company, and make a trading empire that spans the globe.The only thing is, NO YOU CAN'T. The game uses procedurally generated maps?!?! Not only that, but they are TINY procedurally generate maps! You get some fake countries, fake cities, on some fake islandds that make you feel claustrophobic. The map is so small, you do not ever feel like you are in charge of an Ocean Trading Company. It is more like a large lake trading company. At MOST it is a small sea trading company, with the amount of cities in the game from the generated maps, no way in hell you can consider that an ocean trading company.STAY AWAY from this game, if you thought you were getting a game that had expansive possibilities. This game is very limited in scope, which ruins all the fun in my opinion.This game is ONLY worthwhile if the dev realizes that creating Earth, with the hundreds of port cities that were bustling centers of business during the 18th and 19th centuries OR barring that, you add the option to alter the size of the generated maps, to be MUCH larger than what is currently available.. YES, this would be very labor intensive, I am sure of that, but it would mean you are creating something that no other game as done since Uncharted Waters: New Horizons for the SNES. Kalypso doesn't do anything more than small sections of the world in each of their games, which limits those in scope too. If someone could take the time to create the entire world, then that would be something worth spending money on. This though. . .well this is similar to windwar, except turn based battles, and inferior graphics.This game is not expensive, and at it's current price point, it is definitely possible to be a decent purchase, but not with what is available in game at this time. The trading system is very basic, and the maps are so small, most people will most likely be disappointed. You will have to make your own judgement, but I expect many people will refund this game shortly after buying it, because of the things I listed, not to mention other things like not being able to put ships into fleets, not being able to attack other ships, or the fact that pirates are invisible and just attack out of nowhere. That last one actually is ok to me, but the fact that there seems to be no recourse for dealing with pirates, such as finding and raiding their base, does make you feel too powerless.In closing, don't burn your money on this game at this time, but if you really like the idea of this game, just WAIT for the dev to get wise and add some basic features that should have been available on release. I don't think this game is early access, though some say it is. It seems like it should be though, and needs lots of work to be worth more than $3-$5."
,Recommended,576260,29981514,Posted: 17 February,all,Narnach,"Winds of Trade is an interesting game with a lot of potential to be the big trade game of 2017. That said, around launch (mid February 2017) the game is a little rough around the edges, and has room for improvement. In the first nine days after launch there have been four patches that added quality of life improvements and bug fixes, as well as a tutorial to explain the basics of the game. So far, the developers have been very receptive to feedback from the community and seem very committed to work with the community to turn this into the great game it can be.Winds of Trade probably could have launched in early access for a month or two, but what's done is done. The developers are actively improving the game post-launch, so for me that's fine too. If you want to experience a richer, more fully featured game, add the game to your wishlist and ""Follow"" to get updates for patches, then check back in a few weeks.Current features:- Randomly generated world with 20 cities, spread across a few islands with multiple countries.- 20 different goods, with production trees that require input materials to produce their output.- Prices that fluctuate based on supply, demand and availability. It's not as immediate as in Patrician, which causes some balance/exploit problems right now. The devs are looking into this.- Industries in cities level over time, and new ones might appear once a city grows larger due to being supplied with goods.- Some goods are illegal in certain countries, but smuggling is a real possibility (with risks).- Different ships have different trade-offs, as well as an upgrade system to customize each ship with different types of sails or cannons. Different cities have different upgrades!- Automated trade route system, which unlocks once you have 3 ships.- Contract system with different assignments/quests to transport specific packages between cities, or to supply a city with a type of good.- Option to start the game with all ""unlockable"" features unlocked. This is great for a second play through (or a third, or a fourth...)- Stock market for non-player companies (think Industries in Railroad Tycoon), that works based on actual performance. This unlocks once you have 9 trade licenses.- Turn-based combat with pirates, though your faster ships have a good chance of getting away from them, and not risking themselves to be sunk.- Colonies, which unlock once you are friendly with a city/country (haven't used this feature yet).- Events that change the circumstances in the game. Two countries might go to war, and they start issuing assignments to transport troops or arms to the front lines. Demand for arms goes up, and by proxy the demand for iron and coal. A country might have a bad harvest, and it will produce less food for a while, affecting prices.This is pretty long list of features, but there are a number of rough edges on using them, or at least some room for improvement. Some of the unlockable features are not visible until you meet the criteria for them, possibly leading you to believe the features don't exist early on. Price tables were not sortable at launch, but they are now thanks for a patch. A lot of places now have useful popups with price information, and cities show how much resources they consume.There are unfortunately no fleets in the game, yet, but you can copy orders from one ship to another if you want to have multiple ships work the same route. You can add ships to control groups, similar to how that works in strategy games, but that is only useful if you are manually trading. Fleets might stand a better chance against larger pirate fleets.The map size can not be changed, which is something quite some people asked about. This might get addressed, but the devs stated they chose this size to balance world size with keeping it small enough so you can know and remember all the cities in the world. In my game so far (4-5 hours of gameplay) I have Trade Offices in 9 cities across two countries, and I don't find myself wishing for more cities yet. Easier management of trade routes and a better insight into trade opportunities between cities is something I find myself thinking about more... because larger cities tend to both produce and consume a lot of different goods and thus you find yourself studying the cities and making notes about what each city needs and what they produce in excess. The second patch added a tooltip to prices in the ""for sale"" list of a city, so you can put the city's price in context with the lowest/highest price, as well as the average. The fourth patch added insight into a city's domestic consumption of resources, which makes it clear that they consume a *lot* of resources.TL;DR: this game has a lot of interesting systems in it. A game of this complexity is difficult to get right in one go. Luckily the devs are producing patches every few days to address smaller and larger concerns. Check out the discussions, and the patch notes, and use that to judge whether you want to buy the game for its current features and future potential, or whether you want to wait until more of the potential has been realised."
76561198004368051,Not Recommended,576260,33839224,Posted: 27 July,all,DFuxa,"I had high hopes for this game; managing ships and selling around selling goods from destination to destination. However, after 15 hours of play I have come to the conclusion that a lot of work still needs to be done in the game. Some issues that I had playing-You can't jointly carry contract goods in different ships - everything has to be loaded in the same ship.-When loading and unloading ships you have to do it manually for each ship; I'm not against this being an option but when you have a fleet of ships you should be able to load and unload the whole fleet at once.-Difficulty is adjusted on a single slider. Could have been much better to have multiple sliders for starting money and pirate attacks for example-When you are attacked it just randomly happens at the whim of the RNG. Likely the game would have been better if things like Pirates or Faction Ships appeared 'on' the map.-Economy is really easy to abuse. You can ship some Gold for example to a Jewelers shop for a tidy sum; and if there is too much Gold its value doesn't really depreciate enough to stop you from buying it all at a reduced price and then sailing to the next Jewelers shop.-This isn't a combat game but the combat could be fleshed out a lot more.All in all the potential for a good trading simulation game is here but it needs to be fleshed out more to be worth it."

I have not played many games quite like it, and now that I have WoT it won't be necessary, but I do frequently play strategy games. You can practically monopolize the market of any commodity if you are savvy enough. My competitors cringe at the mention of jewelry, ivory, or gold, because I own tens of thousands of tonnes of it and now profit millions. I have never had so much fun molding the prolitariat by exploiting every market loophole imaginable and giving a friggin crimminal 0.04% of my revenue to labour. Seriously, I should be hung!Also, it is worth mentioning that the developers do a fantastic job refining the game with updates."

,Not Recommended,576260,29925892,Posted: 14 February,all,VanillaPCStrategy,"I was very excited to see this game, I love economic simulators and the idea of a dynamic trading world was right up my alley. However the game immediately grew tedious as every action required micromanagement and the UI provided very few clues on the right moves to make. The dynamic markey was pretty great, I must admit, but unfortunately that is all there is to be intersted in. While on paper you have competition, I never saw any indication of that. For example, my ship was the only ship I ever saw on the world map... it felt completely sterile and dull. I had a couple of pirate attacks and never had a clue they were coming until it cut to the tactical screen.I really wanted to enjoy this game but it quickly grew dull and repetitive for me and I just couldn't see myself having fun. Luckily I was able to realize this quickly and was able to get a refund before my two hours were up. I applaud the developer for his efforts and the ideas behind this project but unfortunately the result has come out very flat."

As a result there are a number of very basic issues that a month in EA would have caught.At the moment the game gives you very little info on how to do stuff in-game, although there are tutorials coming. There are numerous minor gameplay, balancing, and QOL issues.To be fair the dev team is checking out the forums every day and implementing suggestions. They want the game to be better, and make changes pretty quick.Was definitely worth the under $20 pricetag though."

I was looking forward to something on a bigger scale.Maybe I haven't gotten the hang of it yet but also feel like there isn't a logical reason for why a wheat producing port is completely out of wheat.  It seems to happen at random with little to do with the ""news"" flashes that I get.  This makes developing a reliable trade route difficult.  I have been playing in sandbox mode and the only leaps of growth I can get with my company is when I smuggle illegal goods and that unfortunately is very hard to do as sneaking fails about 95% of the time.I am sure the devs will fine tune but I think I am going to put this game down for a good while and let them do just that before I begin playing again."

The game has a lot of interesting new ideas, however the graphics are far from the similar ones, but this wouldn't be the problem. The problem is the algorithm of the supply and demand system, which is basically the core of the game. We can call it to an ""exploit"" (like mentioned here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/576260/discussions/0/1473095331503624096/) or whatever, but the game simply fails in its core because of this nonsense issue.

The game starts you off on a ship near some islands and good luck to you. No hint or suggestion of which goods the local port requires, no way to know for sure if the goods you have on board would be needed in another port. The 'industry' tab gives you an overview of all production processes everywhere rather than the specific needs of the location you're at. No other way of figuring out who produces what (and what they would need) other than based on what is available to be bought. (clothes / cloth... then probably someone is producing this). frustrating experience"

Beyond the graphics itself the map is just really boring to look at. The landscape (again like Mount and Blade) is just barren beyond the city itself. No farms, settlements outside the main city, or even military installations; just barren map. That really breaks the atmosphere of the game for me. Even the natural terrain is pretty boring, again like Mount and Blade: Warband, it's as if the modelers just created bumps in the maps and didn't bother to detail them. I've also noticed the trees look pretty bad unless you zoom in all the way and max out the graphic settings; I assume this is because of engine optimization (however at least I haven't experienced performance issues while playing). To be honest this game is just aesthetically really ugly.The trade and navigation mechanics are fine, nothing particularly interesting. I find the combat mechanics to be stiff. It doesn't feel like I'm actually commanding a squadron of ships since you generally find yourself having to stop to fire your cannons. Also you can't really avoid being hit by the enemy so no matter how good you are as a player you're only as good as your in-game equipment.The in-game universe is also pretty inconsistent. The countries you interact with are fictional however the default name for your company is the “East India Company” which implies this game is set on Earth (in what I assume is an alternate timeline). I'm not sure if any of the city names are real either assume they're only made to resemble names in East Asia.While playing this game I could only think about how other games have already done their mechanics better. I actually began to wonder if I accidentally bought an early access game because it seems the trade mechanics were all that was done and the aforementioned problems were just placeholders. I actually don't plan on requesting a refund however because I'm interested on seeing where this game goes, however I could not recommend anyone buy this for full price.(I actually set out on writing a postive review for this game until I reread what I wrote.)"

It would be nice if you could click somewhere on it and it wakes you to that place. I would also like a way to set my own personal hotkeys. I tried but it did not work. Sometimes i become confused when i look at the ""goods prices"" tab because of the buy price and sell price confuse seem backwards in their position.

Each map is dotted by colonies that produce specific goods that can be bought, transported to other colonies, and sold for a profit or not according to your timing. In addition, ships can be purchased, upgraded, or repaired, and captains with different buffs can be hired. If you've ever played a Port Royale or Patrician game, you'll get the hang of it pretty quickly, but there are differences, such as the fluctuating market prices, which vary much more realistically. Also, there is a stock exchange, and your decisions regarding buying and selling goods in the various ports will have a direct effect on share prices.

También podés decidir si ser un comerciante honesto o hacer fortunas contrabandeando! Es un juego muy versátil que promete mucho. Creo que le faltan pulir algunas cosas pero en líneas generales está genial!

Although it reminds me of a game called Trade Wars, which was not a graphics game, and is from many bygone era's. I believe it first came out on the ibm pc, or the comodore not sure which.As for the winds of trade uninteresting, considering there are no instructions yet. Even Trade Wars had instructions, and was more interesting and more fun at the time.I played for a while, actually bought some goods, traveled to other ports, but never figured out how to sell the goods. As a matter of fact after the short time I did play. Didn't remember what goods I bought. But maybe thats the challenge. Since the game is reletively NEW. I will give it a chance and wait a while.I would like to see real world maps and ports for one, and some higher level graphics more in the lines of World of Warships.AS for recommending the game, I will neither recommend, or Not recommend. I will wait. Ooops seems we only have a yes or no on that question so I will say no for now."

The whole game is just about clicking a bit here and there. I stopped this experiment after 20 minutes. Give the game 2017 graphics and sound, double or tripple the price and sell it again."

The game mechanics seem to be well balanced, and there is much to explore in terms of game play.The atmosphere is immediately set thanks to the amazing music/ soundtrack. And the music blends brilliantly into the game.The graphical interface could have been better, but is by no means a game breaker.The tutorial does the job and gives you a smooth start."

In this game it is more of the economic standpoint and not a sailing standpoint though, as you dont actually sail the boat but you instead tell it where to go. you also have more variety to choose from rather than just shipping, you can fight other ships, you can do missions and quests for towns, and can buy stocks in companies. But after about the first few hours you will get bored of that gamemode, so i suggest going and trying out other gamemodes or looking into if there are mods for it. The game has many different modes though so try them out."
