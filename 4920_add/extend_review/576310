,Not Recommended,576310,32706299,Posted: 23 June,all,Nuuskiss,"I really wouldn't recommend this unless it was less than 1$ or free to play. There is so many good walking simulators in Steam, but when it comes to Oracle it feels that it is swiftly develeoped and the story + enviroment is crudely pasted together that holds just barely.There just doesn't seem to be any immaculate element in this game - the island which is available for player to explore is filled with random landmarks and each of these reward player with storytelling which is bizarre and so clueless that it's really hard to if not impossible to keep track on it. From the very beginning to the conclusion I had no clear vision what narrator wanted to tell me, but I might have been too bored even to think about it. There is also apparent graphical glitches occasionally and the exploration is roughly limited with invisible walls.Every cloud has a silver lining though. While the Unity has made it much easier to develeop visually impressive games there was a few points where I forgot the dullness and cons for a moment and just admired the landscapes around me while decent ambient music reached my ears..If you have a thing with walking sims I really would look elsewhere, but if you still keep considering I am sure that the Oracle won't kill your wallet with those couple of bucks it asks."
,Not Recommended,576310,31653309,Posted: 9 May,all,Stachmo,"The first impressions were not great. The graphics are obviously busted and the view distance was very difficult to deal with. Since this is a walking simulator, it is among some of the worst out there. The walking speed is painfully slow which ruins the beauty of walking simulators that it was absolutely torturous being forced to walk slowly on the incredibly hideous  landscape. Sure there are some beautiful moments in this game but this game reminds me too much of the infamous broken game called Jurassic Park: Trespasser back in year 1998. Their graphics and gameplay are surprisingly similar. There are plenty of glitches and invisible walls that add to this unpleasant experience. This certainly did not help me to enjoy Oracle.The only positive is the narration. The narration and difficulties the main character deals with are somewhat solid but that is something to be expected in all first-person adventure games though.Overall, Oracle is simply NOT a good game.3.2 out of 10"

If you like this type of games (and especially those of high quality),do not buy this one.Disadvantages:•It has no obvious beginning or end.•The game seems to be incomplete.•Speed of ""walking"" is really slow.•It does not work properly on the graphics site too - plenty of bugs and glitches, invisible walls, short draw distance on high details, the ground and rocks textures are rendered in a low-resolution.•Audio and narration needs fix too - the story is interesting, but the voice of the narrator has not captured me.•Graphic artists could work more on buildings. They are common and uninteresting. They should add maybe add more details but I have made a few nice screenshoots.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=924057422Advantages:•The game is not overpriced.•It is droping cards and badge looks good•Easy achievements for achievement hunters (guide for getting them ishere).•Short playtime4/10"

You wander around, and at various points some dialogue is triggered.  But since you can wander almost anywhere, you are never sure if you have triggered all the dialogue, or if you did so in any order that makes sense.  Along the way you encounter many graphical flaws, misplaced objects, glitches that stop you from moving, invisible walls, terrible draw distance issues.  If it was finished it might be OK, but as it stands I cannot recommend."
,Not Recommended,576310,30256981,Posted: 1 March,all,Helelix,"Incomplete.I was expecting something like Dear Esther, uncovering the mysteries of the island & the character while you're exploring scenic vistas or haunting caves. Instead there's a swathe of issues detracting from the experience, turning this into a game with the player trying to find & decipher the dialogue snippets. A few things I noticed in my brief 20 minutes of gameplay:- The distant land is bugged. You can see trees in perfect clarity but not the land underneath them. RESOLVED(ish)- Buildings exist but are un-enterable.- The path is covered in shrubs, making it easy to lose.- Some objects are not placed on the ground but rather hover above it.This needs a fair few improvements to make it worthwhile.EDIT: Since I've been asked, I've played the latest version for another 40 minutes. Screenshots with comments can be found in the linked imgur gallery, otherwise i'll surmise here.This review of ""Not recommended"" will remain for the following reasons:- Footfalls (steps) only have a single sound regardless of surface. This is jarring, and breaks immersion.- Its fairly easy to find floating objects. There is little care & attention to detail in placing objects.- There are a number of objects that you can walk through.- Its also not hard to find a clearly uncompletded section of the map.Images of issues;http://imgur.com/a/CUAm2"
76561198048974498,Recommended,576310,33181863,Posted: 3 July,all,rjmacready,"A lot of people complain about ""walking simulators"" being too linear, but after playing this one, I gotta say...a little linearity doesn't go astray.Unless you're someone who prefers a gaming experience with quite literally no goal or purpose, other than to wander aimlessly and hear broken shards of narrative whilst accruing the occasional Achievement, the level of satisfaction on offer here may be questionable. I tend to like games with a beginning, middle and an end, and Oracle...well, I guess it has a beginning. And some stuff which comes after.Which is not to say the game has no redeeming features. The sound design is mostly excellent - a vivid recreation of nature in all its splendour - except that the footstep sound effects, like the painfully monotonous voice-over, don't vary much, sounding the same on wooden floorboards as they do on dirt roads. The enticingly abstract piano music which plays throughout, on the other hand, is almost enough to persuade one to forgive the game's other aural shortcomings.The ""jump"" button is a true curiosity. The sound effect it creates is...er...a little immersion-breaking to say the least, and while it's sometimes necessary to use the button to access certain areas, I encountered at least two points where I was able to magically jump by increments to a preposterous height before coming back down to Earth. A glitch, I'm presuming. Nothing much to complain about, in other words, but not exactly something to praise either.(I might also add that jump buttons are often a tad inadvisable in games which aim to be relaxing and dream-like, as the player must struggle with the constant temptation to idiotically bunny-hop through much of the game, especially if not much of anything is happening. Doesn't exactly add to the ""atmosphere"", I'm afraid.)The graphics are also generally nice aside from bodies of water, which are regrettably prominent throughout and look more like a ""green-screen"" insert than an organic part of the game's world (you CAN walk on the bottom of the lake without dying, though; which is, er, ""novel"" to say the least)! The draw distance of the graphics also proved somewhat dubious, as geography in the distance can sometimes vanish or appear, depending on the angle you're approaching from (I'm assuming it wasn't just my laptop, which generally has no problems with demanding graphics; though Rise of the Tomb Raider admittedly did a good job of kicking its butt)! You'll also occasionally find yourself chasing landmarks which simply can't be reached, although there's no way of knowing that 'til you've wasted several minutes trying.Walking speed is another frequent bone of contention in walking simulators. Here there is only one walking speed, despite the fact that holding down ""shift"" does try to give the illusion of slowing down by halving the amount of footsteps you hear...without the actual physical speed changing one iota. And then, of course, there's the quality of the writing, the importance of which can never be underestimated when it's the only thing resembling ""narrative"" in an otherwise meaningless wander. Let's just say that the writing here, while perfectly serviceable, is certainly nothing to ""write home about"" (pun most likely intended).When all is said and done, the best walking simulators have a sense of focus. Even if the story only intermittently ties in with the scenery being presented, there's still a genuine sense of the player having been on a journey from which they emerge a slightly ""changed"" person. Sounds a tad lofty and all, but there's ultimately not much point to the narrative unless it tells an interesting story, or at the very least tells us something about ""ourselves"". I don't feel this game did either, but there may be some out there who feel differently.Only recommended to those who think that ""open world"" design is a good thing, even when it comes at the expense of a more substantial narrative experience (and anyone willing to hunt down all twenty-four of those Achievements is a ♥♥♥♥in' SAINT, I tell ya).Verdict: 6/10."

,Not Recommended,576310,30526121,Posted: 15 March,all,CorvusCorax,"Oracle is perhaps a great first step towards the walking simulator genre. A good game to experience what it means to play such a casual game with a peaceful environment.The problem is that the game often feels unpolished. We explore interesting locales with our globe-trotter protagonist but some of these locations feel unfinished. You have clipping issues here and there, glitches occur randomly and some of the objects (including trees) seem to be floating just above the ground.It's nice to have high mountains and - as the description says - a 5 square mile map but what is the purpose of this if you see a lot of ""empty"" areas? I saw a section of a mountainous region only to notice texture issues. You can also jump into the water but swimming is not an option - you walk on the underwater floor while looking at the plants and strange effects accompanying this experience.The music and the voice over are great. The game reminded me of Bottle several times, however, the aforementioned game was a properly finished product. And while the story is interesting it can never reach the level the Old City Leviathan has.I do not wish to be too critical. Oracle is a somewhat mediocre walking simulator, however, some of the greater names out there can also be purchased for the same price and offer way more insight into this genre."
,Not Recommended,576310,31652666,Posted: 9 May,all,Kovic,"I like Walking Sim games, so keep that in mind with what I write.This is a poorly optimized cluster of assets with a non-linear progression that is entirely confusing and not enjoyable.My frame rates bounced anywhere from 25-62 FPS depending on the location.  Not good.The story is simply a narrative you here once you are near a random location, no way to know if your hearing a story in the correct order, or if the story has a point.There is a reason many walking sim games are mostly linear, its because they are designed to allow a flow to the player as well as a solid structure for a story arc, something this game is missing.Graphically it is nothing more than a bunch of simple assets thrown together and you'll notice many areas of overlap, basically the entire map needs refinement.  For instance, I was able to walk on water at the beginning, then simply walk at the bottom of the water in most other areas.  I also fell through a bridge twice and had to make my way up the cliffside, which jumping up near sheer edges mostly works.You will get lost, the paths are not easy to follow, and after about 30min you will probably turn the game off and forget about it.  That said, there are achievements, so if you want to slowly wander around a mostly open world to find every location, go ahead.As you can tell I did not enjoy this, even if I only paid $0.67 for it.  It more about the time I spent than the cost of the game.  The main reason I enjoy walking sim games is to be immersed into a world/story and truly escape reality for a few hours, this didnt do that, in fact, it was tiresome and boring.I respect that a dev took time to create this world and story, but it is far too rough around the edges to be considered a recommended walking sim."

Found several buildings and structures, most bizarre of which was a huge skull rising into the air on the end of a sword. The reason for this being there is either beyond my comprehension or perhaps I didn't uncover everything to be found on the island, which I'm sure I didn't. Dialogue from the narrator and person living on the island pops up whenever you find a landmark. Made with Unity the graphics look pretty good and framerate ran at a steady 30. If you like a nice country stroll with soothing music in the background then try this out and perhaps you'll play the whole scenario and discover what it's all about. For currently $1.49 spend your cash and support this indie developer."

If reached, there was no option to enter or interact with them in any way.

,Not Recommended,576310,31059385,Posted: 10 April,all,Emily Kaldwin,"Oracle is a very pretty game, but that doesn’t matter much at this point. I knew this was a storyteller game, and I’ve liked those in the past, so I bought it. Fortunately it’s really cheap, but if I had known what I know now, I probably wouldn’t have paid for it at all. Like I said, it’s a beautiful game, but when you can’t interact with things, and all you do is walk… In my opinion they could’ve worked a bit harder on making it look great. Because I’m sure it could’ve been better. If you could interact, or if there were other people or animals there, or just… MORE, then maybe, but you walk and walk and walk, and the trees and mountains disappear, so it’s glitchy, and you walk sooo slowly. To be an open world, let the player at least have the option to run. Or walk faster, anything will do. I know the point is to kinda take everything in and all that, but if you get the option you can at least slow down. It just annoyed me a bit because with a bit of work it would be a relaxing, beautiful game. And at this point it’s not.Also there’s a story but it’s hard to pay attention to it. To be honest, I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because I’m getting annoyed by everything else, or maybe it’s just not interesting enough.Either way. Needs work. Not really worth the money, even if it’s cheap. But!!: it has potential though!"

The island is full of levitating trees, bushes etc., water has no animation at all and there's no such thing like swimming animation. You just walk across the bottom of the lake, your screen turns blue-ish as you go underneath the water level and you keep exploring bugged plants and rocks.Whole world is over-highlighted, and actually hurts my eyes, lacks distance rendering and its exploration is boring.To summarize this,Game is unfinished, unoptimized and since there's plenty of issues, it is unplayable for more than half an hour, because it gets boring.

,Recommended,576310,34449208,Posted: 23 August,all,demofusion,"A neat, prettily designed short game without much action besides walking on a strange island, discovering half-ruined landmarks and reminiscing on your relationship with a sinister woman whose influence on your life has been disastrous. The deeper nature of the narrator's feelings for and about her are gradually revealed in voiceover as he stumbles upon each key location.Although any underlying themes are never made entirely clear, the experience in total is quite absorbing and enjoyable. That said, there are some amusingly unrealistic details, like the fact that you won't be killed even if you fall down a mountain slope - you never really fall, you just keep running along the cliff - or spend hours wandering underwater without needing to come up for air (which could simply be a device to avoid complicating the plot, but it also made me think of a certain theory that I won't divulge for fear of spoilers).Interestingly enough, the way dry ground blends into the sea bed is poetically surreal in places, with stunning colors and blooming vegetation peeking from just below the surface of the water. The various monuments are beautifully made (if creepy sometimes) and relatively easy to find and explore - except the ancient mine which, sadly, appears to be inaccessible for some reason.This isn't a game for action enthusiasts. It is somewhat idiosyncratic, story-driven but obscure at the same time, looking more like a demo rather than a brief but complete game. However, the lovely landscapes and dreamy atmosphere are worth at least one playthrough. The puny price and the bonus of achievements and trading cards are an additional couple of reasons to give it a try."

It looks kind of nice, which you can say about most of them.  As mentioned the draw distances are wonky and there are no graphical settings other than resolution (it didn't list my monitor's res).  The game claims dozens of locations, but there really aren't that many places to go or things to hear.  There is no path.  You basically go anywhere on the map except the castle on the hill with the invisible wall stopping you.  I didn't get more than 45 minutes and couldn't see anything I missed.  The voice acting would be nice except there are no audio controls so the voice is set way louder than the pleasant music.   Here's the thing about pleasant music and calm narrators.  It can make a junky narrative sound completely reasonable.   If any human being said these things outside of a calm voice lulling you into thinking it's poetry, you'd think the person had mental problems.  Honestly the narrator is just gushing about a woman who is most likely a complete sociopath and the narrative literally goes nowhere.    I'd say something similar about the Drivel Path games, except that at least those are much more complete, much longer, more intricate, and are on a completely different level graphically and atmospherically."

They are wonderfully mixed generating the thing we callatmosphere.

Its like reading a good book but also starring at your screen and being forced to walk around to listen to the rest of it.The draw distance could be raised, especially in a game like this that isn't taxing on most hardware an ""Ultra"" with really great draw distance would make the game better, Also adding animals running around would be great, we hear all these birds and crickets and other animals singing about but see nothing, helps add to the envirnoment and will for sure help the atmosphere.(again from what i've played) There is no map, And your travel is completely based off what you see far off in the distance.

I would quite often stop and look at the scenery and marval at the water lapping up on the shore or the sunlight reflecting on the waves. If you go into the water it really does feel like you are under water. I overlooked the fact that you can stay underwater indefinitely. The trees and rocks and the whole look of the game is very good for such a low priced game.Unfortunately that's where the positives end really.The character moves painfully slow. I guess it prolongs the game and gives you a chance to view the scenery but it can become a little frustrating.The story is non-scensical and a bit pretentious. There is no story really. Just a man talking about meeting some journalist I think. I would have much preferred it if there was a decent story related to the island. At one point they mentioned giants. Why not pick up on that storyline?Overall I quite enjoyed just walking around and getting all the achievements. If you like walking simulators I would pick it up in the sale. I only paid 36p ($0.5) so I definitely have no quibbles paying that. I feel there was a missed opportunity with the storyline as the environment is surprisingly well done.

I got stuck in a spot that I can't get out of so I haven't been able to finish the story, but so far it just sounds like a boring narration of a John Green book.I'm glad I only wasted 50 cents on this, but even that's not worth it."

The island itself is attractive enough, and buggy, and you will spend your 2 hours with the game walking around it.  There is no interactivity, only short bursts of a ""story"" that is somewhere between a plea for experiencing art without preconceptions, and the diary of a serial killer.  I played Oracle after the achievements were added, and I'm grateful, not only do I like achievements, but, otherwise, I wouldn't have known there was an end to the game.Bottom line: Worth a couple bucks if you like exploring for a couple hours on a pretty island with some knick-knacks.  Nowhere near as pretty as Dying Light: The Following's countryside, but it gets the job done."

Just be advised it looks like it needs a lot of polishing. some areas look very unfinished, the graphics are....quaint... and there's nothing to do beyond walking around and triggering narratives. If you REALLY need a walking sim fix, this will do, it's dirt cheap. If you're looking for an experience, this isn't for you."

(If ou can find them)The graphics are fairly low end with a short draw distance which also means you can't scout from high points, as objects that may be within distance ""pop in"" to existance once you get close.There is no life what so ever in the game. Its a dead island without so much as a bird flying off in the distance.You can walk up sheer cliffs and underwater and simply using the jump button can climb any terrain but can jump a log on the ground!After a couple of hours it just becomes a chore trying to find some hidden places to get the next paragraph of the story that by this time has already be all but forgotten.As far as walking simulators go, this is down the bottom of the list.Even for its low price, it is still barely worth it!"

View distance limited and water looked pretty bad. Would be great if you could enter buildings, etc., but that doesn't happen, as far as I got, which wasn't that far as I got bored. The story line was really weak and contrived.  The movement is jerky and what bothered me the most, or became irritating was the same sound of footsteps no matter where you went, even in water and the slow sprinting speed was also frustrating. Like others said, this needs a good story line with real content and better involvement.OK for $1.99 and I hope the developers can do better on their next one."

,Recommended,576310,30256061,Posted: 1 March,all,KyleKidd,"First Impressions Gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQPTeetMZyg&feature=youtu.beEDIT:The newest update for this game addressed a few of the concerns I originally wrote in this review.  For instance, movement speed is now faster, and you can also sprint with shift.  Frame rates have improved, and the game looks a bit better off into the distance.  There is still room for improvment, but I feel that I can now recommned this game.  I also want to point out that the developer reached out to me within minutes of my review hitting the store page; addressing my concerns and discussing improvment to the game with me.  It is apparent that the developer (who is one person by the way) cares deeply for the game they created, and wants to create something that people will enjoy.  I'm confident the developer will continue to refine this game, and I'm looking forward to games released by Watercolor Studios in the future.Original Review Below:I bought this game randomly seeing the low price of $1.49, and the great looking preview videos on the steam store.While I cannot recommend this game in its current state, I can definitely see potential.  If the developer can fix a few key issues (such as the terribly slow walking speed, various graphical issues, optimization), I could recommend the game with a clear conscious.I can pretty much sum it up my experience with a pros and cons list:PROSThe game looks great.  Built with unity, there are parts of the game with some really nice visuals.Voice acting is decent. I wasn't blown away, but as far as immersion goes, the voice acting was good enough to get me interested in the story and had me looking for dialogue.The sound track is awesome.  I truly loved it.The scenery gives the game an interesting twist.  There are areas and props in the game that really had me scratching my head.  Not in a bad way, but more of in a ""whats going on here"" kind of way.CONSRight off the bat, I was hit with some really low frame-rates.  I have a beefy computer, so I'm not sure if maybe there is an optimization issue or whats going on.  It did seem to smooth out after about 5 minutes or so after I left the starting area.Graphical issues are noticeable.  Some of the props seem to be sunken into the land (take a look at the back of the church and the windows).  The clouds do this weird thing where they can clip through the trees.  Objects seems to pop in and out as they are rendered at what appears to be a hard set render distance.  And some objects seem to render fully while others appear foggy at a distance.  I noticed this mostly with trees in the far distance being rendered seemly in the middle of the air in the distance, while the land they were on had fog of distance.Not always a clear direction on where to go.  After the church, I was lost.  Saw a large skull floating in the distance, so I went that way, only to wander off again.  I'm sure I missed a lot of the game from just skipping around, which is slightly annoying.  It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the next issue:You cannot run.  I get it, this is a walking simulator, but with the scale of the terrain in this game, it really just makes the experience feel drawn out.  Walking slowly from one place should be an experience and play a role.  Not just an excuse to make the game feel big because you move so extremely slow.  Maybe include a toggle-able option in the menu to allow sprinting for when you miss something all the way across the map.  Most people are going to get frustrated spending 20 minutes walking back and forth through an area you've already been.Another note about moving: for some reason you can walk underwater.  When walking into water, you just casually walk under the waves as if the water was not even there.  Also, any steep terrain can be navigated by simply jumping repeatedly while moving forward."

Sprint increases speed by about 1%, narration gets detracted from by the fact that it's fragmented. By the time you unlock another piece of the story you tend to forget what the last part was. There is no direction, there are invisible walls preventing access to various landmarks.The 'game' feel's like it's only half created and hasn't yet reached beta. You get what you pay for."

If you are searching an immersive indie game this isNOTfor you. The graphic is kinda nice but it falls in the mediocre. Let me start saying that the water in this game looks really bad at the beginning. It made me wanna quit the game. Other than that there are way too many factors that just don't allow you to be fully immersed like the fact that you can climb stupidly stupidly steep mountains by jumping and that running is as fast as walking.PROS:decent plota lot explorecheaprelatively good graphic (6/10)CONSnot immersive at allkinda frustrating cause the character is really slowbad interface during dialogsGOOD GAME FOR THE COST 2 BUCKS.FINAL RATING (6.5/10)
