It is indisputably a beautiful game... If you can get past the main character's horrendous personalities somehow. Honestly, all of these characters lack even the most basic of normal tropes. They are ALL so... Weak, pathetic, annoying... I hate them all. The only characters I took any interest in weren't even important in the story. AKA the Waiter and the two ""noblewomen"". The random♥♥♥♥♥Cat quest was weird and unimportant. I opened up most of the story by skipping because I couldn't take another mispelled word or the characters themselves. They are so shallow it's disheartening.While I don't recommend this game, I don't necessarily regret buying it. The artwork and music truly is beautiful. Not only that, but this game DOES have potential. It's features are very interesting, I imagine it must have also been quite limiting. A worthy attempt at something different for sure.Creativity: 8/10Characters: 0.5/10 (The side characters are the only reason this is not a solid 0)Story: ...No.Artwork: 9/10Music: 9/10Overall: 1.5/10 (Story and Characters are very important...)Sadly, I play visual novels for the story and characters. Could not care less about the art and music, so for me this is a no go but perhaps for someone interested in art and music this could be a nice change of pace. This does also have great potential. I just hope the author in question works on their storywriting and making their characters more believable with preferably better options. Best of luck, everyone.(Don't mind the amount of time it says I've played. From the beginning alone it's quite easy to tell what happens after the first 15 minutes. It's a drag on of a ""story"" as well.)"

I bought this game because it claims to offer different new features and I must say it was able to keep me interested for quite a while. Frequent choices and the fact that you can shape each character attitude is quite a nice mechanic.Also i really liked the music, very immersive and relaxing. The art is cute too.PROS:- The game gives you the possibility to play it in different languages. There are fews VN in german. That is a big +- Free 18+ content on their website.- Lots of interesting game mechanics like the Karma- Awesome music- Good artCons- I found a side quest (the cat one) not so interesting ... but that can be skipped- It takes a bit of time to get used to the characters, at the beginning they seem like jerks but when you start knowing them well they are quite nice.Overall yeah the game was a blast, I had a good time. 8/10"
,Recommended,576400,31096790,Posted: 12 April,all,Amber,"As far as Visual Novels go, this one has to be the most feature packed. The replayability is boosted by the ability to control the behaviors of not just the ""main character"" but all the supporting characters as well. Making one character a pervert, and making that same character smart and good natured in another playthrough.There is one thing that bothers me though, and that is the Knight.Possible Spoiler WarningThe Prince is short tempered and stubborn, and the Merchant is level-headed but flaunts his wealth. Supposedly, the Knight was meant to be something in between these two extremes. Elisa even comments that the fact that he refuses to flirt with her makes her wants to try even harder... then within the next 10 minutes of game, he is already falling over himself to keep her around. He knows nothing about her, and she knows nothing about him. There was no character development, and yet he has become a totally different person just in the time it took her to change his bed sheets.I agree with Elisa's original statement in that the mystery of the Knight is what had drawn me into wanting to get to know his story... but how quickly he flipped and became basically ""just another smitten suitor"" was very offputting :'(That being said though, the game is still WELL worth 10USD (current price as of 13/04/2017). The writing is a nice balance between historic (Using titles such as Your Grace, and My Lady as per the time period of the game) and modern (relaxed tone such as ""What's up?""). The music, when lowered to the first quarter of the volume slider makes a perfect background addition to the events taking place. The art is very well done, and the expressions of the characters are believable as well as invoking some empathy (if one happens to be empathetic :D ).My only real gripe is the save naming system could be improved:)I may have my gripes about some of the ""character development"" in the initial scenes, but it's still an excellent game. Definitely worth a try for any VN fan."
,Recommended,576400,29988834,Posted: 17 February,all,Saitzu,"I haven't played much yet but for now, all that I can say about this game is pretty much all good.I have played plenty of  VN and Otome games and it is the first time I play this kind, it is completely different to the games that I am used to play.First of all, I have to say how much I love the Cg's. I love how well they are done. The music is another really good point, there are plenty and different. Some times you can even see the characters interacting in the background, it gives a new feeling than just seeing an static one from the place where they are at the moment.The game has a few different endings and it is ruled by Karma. I haven't figure out how it works but I guess I will eventually.Maybe something that I would like to change about the game is the skip button, it skips too slowly, it would be good if it were faster and just by clicking in the screen be able to stop it and not having to search the skip button to stop it.I haven't seen any other bad things, maybe some minor mistakes but nothing to be too concerned about."
,Recommended,576400,32068186,Posted: 30 May,all,Red Steel,A fun interactive visual novel has several choices that change the story as you progress. You can be evil or good. I can confirm different choices lead to different reasons in the story. Beautiful art and music.

The art is excellent and I feel transported into another world of this fantasized version of Europe/Italy and I do love all of the work that was put into this.I don't understand why there are choices because it didn't feel like I was part of the story, the choices were there to make them good or bad, but I honestly felt I wasn't making any kind of difference. In some cases I felt like I was making things way worse and some storylines got really boring.Elisa's action and thoughts REALLY♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off immensely. How can she run an Inn with her kind of attitude. She can't afford to lose anyone but loses a guy who has been by her side since childhood?There are way too many points of view to focus on and it's hard to keep track. It'd be more focused if you could play the WHOLE game through the eyes of one of her suitors and the others were the ones you went against and you just played a role in the story. In cases of visual novels I like first person rather than 3rd person or omniscient POV's.I would not recommend this game. Despite the fantastic art and setting, it's too unfocused, long and a few of the characters' motivations are either outrageous or don't make sense or are cliche."
,Not Recommended,576400,33303649,Posted: 6 July,all,Dragoslove,"The characters in this feel more like caricatures of their professions than people.  The Prince and Merchant are both complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and only serve to make the knight nicer by comparison.  I coudn't make it past the first 15 minutes of the game due to horrible dialouge."
76561198354077790,Not Recommended,576400,34871447,Posted: 10 September,all,TaiChi963,"WARNING: Re-released recently, and it think that it's to combat its poor reviews.I get what they were trying to do here, breaking the mold and all that, but seriously, in order to get emotional investment into characters and therefore get any emotional response, you need to have relatable or likeable characters. Every single character is such a piece of crap, being characatured stereotypes of their vocations: You have a douchy prince who thinks his name is enough to woo Elisa, a merchant who thinks his wealth will woo Elisa, a servant who thinks that his loyalty will woo Elisa and, interestingly, a MGTOW knight that wants nothing to do with her until she actively makes it her business to seduce him. There is next to no character development, and the charactes never stop being the most annoying I'v ever seen in a VN. I do have to give them credit for the decent music, nice visuals and at times quite funny moments, but still, I bought this on sale and feel ripped off. Go buy The Last Birdling instead."

,Recommended,576400,31535485,Posted: 3 May,all,Stray,"5 hours for the only ending that's worth it,(Knight)and even the epilouge afterward is pretty cringe.. It's full of grammatical errors and plain awkwardly translated sentences since the author is Italian. The two characters in the beginning are horriblly unlikeable and will constantly impede the story's progress. The art is alright, I'm not sure why it's tagged for nudity, because there's none. Background art is constantly re-used even when noted it's a different bar or inn. The added ""side-quests"" don't addmuchbackstory. One is literally about a cat that will never re-appear again. All in all, it kept my interest, I unlocked 4 other endings only by reloading by 5 minutes to see what would happen and the other characters are not well-written or interesting enough for me to want to invest any more time in this game.Recommended with a hot mug of tea, but wait for a sale, the most to pay is $5 for ashort,mildly amusing read.P.S. The music in this game is extremely cozy, get the soundtrack."
,Recommended,576400,33152847,Posted: 2 July,all,angelpsyche,i bought this on sale as i'm looking for an otome/visual novels. its a good price on sale.game play is quite unique/different from other visual novels. you play as an inspectator guiding the characters and discovering how things unfolds.art and music are nice.the characters are not perfect. they can be a bit too much at times.i mean elisa is a seductress who enjoys playing/seducing any men who comes in her inn. the prince is self centered. and so on...but they learned to grow depending on the choices.story is not as smooth as i hoped for but its okay. i enjoyed how things unfolded but needs additional content to explain more about things. story and ending felt a bit rushed.still this is a good read to pass the time.

76561198069159152,Recommended,576400,34429892,Posted: 22 August,all,wrb41977,"This is an interesting game. The routes are not traditional in method, as there is only one place where Elisa ends up with a love interest. Most of the game revolves around how her actions (and those of others) interact.It is a decent game, but I would suggest getting it on sale. Also, there is an explicit patch, but I am unsure how well it works."

You Start As A prince And Work Your Way Through Each And Every Character Creating A New Story Each Time You Play And To Be Fully Honest It Was Very Enjoyable.I Recommend This Game To Anyone Who Likes Multiple Endings With The Most Amazing Artwork You Could See On A Visual Novel, While Bringing Both Excitment And Cheer Into A Light Hearted Game The Only Way To Play This Game Is To Explore.Eliza Is A Very Cunning Girl And Even I Was Slipped Up From Her Words At Times....She Is One Strange But Hilarious Person I Tell You!."

76561198041810417,Not Recommended,576400,31663725,Posted: 10 May,all,Katana,"At first I was excited by one of the features of this game. Choices have an impact on way the story plays. You do not just control the MC's choices, but the suitors as well and each choice is either labeled angelic, neutral, or demonic.My issue started with the MC. She is dressed provocatively and says she is a nice decent girl not interested in romance, but IS SHE REALLY?! The Knight, at first, does not care for romance either, so what does this MC do?! She likes that he's hard to get, goes to his room to change his sheets so that she can ""reel him in."" That is the picture you see up there where she is sitting on the bed all seductive like. So, I got the feeling she is just playing with everyone's emotions and her words/actions do not match up.Continuing on...I ended where one of the Knights retainers talked to his superior about how he would follow a girl like that like a dog on a leash.It sort of ended it for me. I don't like those kind of characters that lower themselves so subjectively. I am not sure if the story get's better because I immediately requested a refund. It might get better. I'll let you decide. For me, I do not wish to take the chance and spend my money if I am going to sigh with annoyance with this characters."

Instead we got a stand alone adult thing.I'm still not interested in reading all age Elisa, buy now I've got an adult stand alone thing that is useless if I don't read all age Elisa.There's also this new Nutaku adult game, But I won't give them anymore money at this point.Anyway, I don't buy things from site like Nutaku : site with more than 90% trashes."
