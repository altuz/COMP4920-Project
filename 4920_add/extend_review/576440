It is stolen from ""Bootham"", created by visionstudiosUK that is ranked #1 on an indie game site and was released in Oct 16th, 2016. They stole the same art and concept. The game play is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥and jump scares are easily ignored after the first one. Go download ""Bootham"" and enjoy the actual, finished game."
,Not Recommended,576440,32573972,Posted: 19 June,all,MAriskaDeville,"https://youtu.be/g1B59c_Xxu0This game really adds very little to the formula of wonder round empty corridors and collect items. Graphics are ugly for the most part, the audio is average and the controls are cumbersome because you can't sprint.To amke matter worse to collect 'battery power' for your feeble flashlight you need to investigate random corpses (no I'm not joking) and sometime they have power for your battery, but sometimes they have (dull ) jump scares that increase your fear meter. Once your fear meter fills up you die, and its game over.So the overall expeience is just dull and plodding. This game really needs to get to a hospital as it is on life support already."

The game is broken, the first level is unbeatable, its extremely slow, you walk at slug speed, it only has Unity Store Assets and the whole game makes no sense whatsoever and still, it has bad english saying ""You are died"" when you die.I made a whole video about this crap:https://youtu.be/bVtQySbInfc"

,Not Recommended,576440,30399569,Posted: 8 March,all,CorvusCorax,"""Are you ready to face into fear""?Talk about bad English grammar! In recent months I have played some indie games with such bad grammar (I'm looking at you, Conclusion) but to see this is now a trend along with a (probably) Unity-based, quickly-put-together, barely-tested environment is just sad. Very sad!Funny thing is I purchased the game as it was cheap and I liked some of the screenshots (also horror is my favourite genre). Yet, I was unable to understand the story itself. The ""intro"" (i.e. a text read aloud by a guy with similarly bad English) talks about an accident but I could not figure out why the hospital where our protagonist awakes is full of dead bodies (some of them are standing?!) as well as why these cadavers have batteries on them (essential for our flashlight).Once you're in possession of a guide telling you what to do the game can be completed in 20 minutes. But hey, if you play for several more hours you get to receive some more achievements! The ending is a let-down (along with the entire game, for that matter) so much so that you feel embarrassed because you cannot respond to the ultimate question: ""Why did I even bother?""Horror Hospital suffers from the typical symptoms these games have:-- horrible graphics (often untested i.e. artefacts and glitches here and there)-- horrible everything-else (gameplay, music, sound effects, etc.) -> no production value, whatsoever; it can only result in an unpolished game-- horrible English grammar (sometimes the text appears in Turkish)If we keep upvoting these and giving them a chance for Greenlight or Early Access or whatever system it is they can get through they'll just keep popping up as an easy cash-grab. Why is this a problem? Because it could have been something much, much better based on the idea."

,Not Recommended,576440,33143425,Posted: 2 July,all,Nosferatu,"This game adds nothing new to the horror genre, you walk around & pick up items. The graphics are not good looking. The controls are annoying (with no sprint option). And lame jump-scares.You're supposed to search random corpses in a hospital for 'battery power'. Sometimes corpses have energy, sometimes they have poor jump scares. Enduring jump scares increases your 'fear meter' and once that is full, you die.There's no in-game option for graphics or audio, you have to exit to the main menu to adjust these.The game is not good."

Needed something to get the old adrenaline going and all this did was♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. When I see bad reviews why don't I listen.  Many of the games I have on my wishlist have bad reviews, time to lighten the load!"

,Not Recommended,576440,34157800,Posted: 10 August,all,Chemkitty,"Seizure warning. Drunk walking. ZERO meat to the story.It gives you some background in the binning and after that you're just kinda there. I guess it's a good deal for $1 though, you get most of your achievements and badges from just starting new games or playing for amounts of time so hey, free steam XP right?..."

Check it out and see for yourself.  But just no to buying this one...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBOXbSNMqw0"

76561198062085771,Recommended,576440,31554200,Posted: 5 May,all,matt19852085,I played this game until the end I was not fussed on it but then again I dont think I paid much for it it was entertaining to a point where if you died you had to go right back to the beginning and start collecting eight photos again which were hard to spot not much horror really only 2 people wondering around trying to scare you has you progress through the hospital.
,Recommended,576440,31026471,Posted: 8 April,all,Chulupian Spiderman,This game takes you through a journey of self-worth and finding out who you really are as a person. The horror and jumpscares really give you a perspective on how terrifying the real world can be. Not only was the horror good but the ending left me in tears because it was the most beautiful event i have ever witnessed. Finally a good horror game to really frighten you and makes you question your own sanity

After dissapointments such as skyrim, fallout, GTA 5 and many more at last a game that is really worth hours upon hours of gameplay. Highly recomend! The ending is life changing."
,Recommended,576440,29061008,Posted: 6 January,all,Huckleberryhound,"https://youtu.be/hpKCJGcYYo0I have this thing where i play the first 15 minutes (give or take 20 minutes lol) of new indie games, then totally judge the game in my ignorant non designer fashion. This video is another such endeavour.I have to say i am giving this game a thumbs up. I spent last year playing small indie games with a horror bent, with costs ranging from 0.99 to 19.99. It's made me rethink what we are supposed to expect for our money, and how our expectations are skewed by steam sales where we can buy AAA games for a fiver.This game is nice on the eye, and basically in one piece. To expect more for 2.39 is a big ask, IMHO. Not only that, it's playable...which believe me, is a step up from some of the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you get on steam. If i had any criticism, it would be...1) the kills/jump scares are pretty random/arbitrary. This takes them out of the ""Gameplay"" realm, as there's no obvious reason or way to think your way out of the,.2) the Mcguffins you find are really small, making the gameplay a little difficult for no emersively obvious reason.3) A plot of some kind would help.None of these things take away from the fact that the game for what it is, is fairly well put together.Couldn't find the last two photos in my short playthrough, and found no obvious use for the book...but what you gonna do. I might even play it again to see what i can do lol.On a sidebar note, the child laughing audio they used is the same as one my mother in law used for her ringtone. Not sure if that makes it more or less scary.Huck."
