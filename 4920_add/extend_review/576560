It seems this new rise of easy achievement games are using achievements to make ppl buy their crappy game. Zup has started a trend that started out new and intresting but if the gameplay is♥♥♥♥♥♥there is no point in the achievements. I will not be buying anymore easy achievement games if the gameplay is boring/rubbish/repetative etc.

They made 1 map that they loop for 12 ""levels"", where u kill ""zombie spawn generators"". Next level adds 1 more generator, and that's it. 500+ achievements where u kill 1000 zombies and shoot 3 guns into the air.. = 100%.. So.. yeeah. This is the future of Steam cause nobody gives a s**t.."
,Not Recommended,576560,29204547,Posted: 12 January,all,Vaagur,The achievements are uninspired and the gameplay is really boring. There's only 4 or 5 guns and one level. It's always the same thing execpt for having more spawners in further levels...The boss is also always the same and the game takes about 45 minutes to complete.I can understand that one dollar is cheap... But it wasn't really worth it haha.

You have the same 3 basic zombie types (Which to mention, their models are quite broken and so are the sounds) inclduing the ""Crawler"", ""Giant Zombie"", and your regular average everyday ""Normal Zombie"". There are 4 weapons in total that you can obtain by the 4th level out of the like 12 levels there are. I played this game on Hard and it was just like melting butter in half with a 1000 degree knife. By the way forgot to mention, the ""Zombie Boss"" isn't much of a boss, it's just a typical villain named ""Cyborg Leader"" that spawns zombies in and is just annoying, you see him everyday and he is just another zombie that deals more damage and has more health, nothing much special about him. The map is the same thing over and over again, the same subway station that you're trying to ""Help clear out"" which most of this just doesn't make sense, especially the fact that you need to destroy generators in order to stop zombies spawning and coming out of the ground? I don't know, I just don't like it, sorry but this game seems like it was made in the year 2000, it reminds me of Medievil for Playstation 1. The difference is, Medievil is a great game with variety and it's fun to play."

,Not Recommended,576560,29205155,Posted: 12 January,all,Vincentimus,"Very boring gameplay. The first level is fun, the rest of the levels are the same map but with a few more zombie spawners that you'll have to kill. At level 4 you've also unlocked all the weapons so after level 4 nothing gets added to your gameplay anymore.You can simply hold shift and left mouse button since you shoot just fine while sprinting and all ammo is infinite. Also you gain health for killing zombies, so you can't really die, even if you get hit a lot.This game has 578 achievements and you get none for completing the levels or playing at a higher difficulty. You get 500 for 1000 kills, meaning an achievement will pop up every time the game registered 2 kills (which will often take more than 2 kills). The remaining 78 achievements are simply for using weapons. It takes only half of the game to get 578/578.EDIT: Achievements have been added for completing levels, up to 12.There is no point in completing the game. After one level you've seen it all and if you like achievement hunting you'll be done at about half the game. There is nothing rewarding you for completing the game or any level whatsoever.The game is cheap and for a very short period of time it was fun but seeing how I completed the game after 0,8 hours it might not be even worth the small amount of money I paid for this game."

To me having a lot of achievements is supposed to show dedication, having entierly completed a game. Which this is entierly contradicting, with its 578 achievements that personally took me less than 30 minutes to unlock.The game itself isn't very good either, it both feels and looks like an uncompleted project that was edited to simply capitalize off steams achievement system. Bad graphics and extremely linear and easy gameplay. For its price I don't expect much more than it being a money grab so I can't particularly complain too much about the quality of the game."

But the fact that it's so badly executed makes the game not worth your while. Unless the developer would somehow manage to get this game running smoothly in Unity, I don't see how anyone could enjoy it for longer than 10 minutes.(For the record, I played it for a bit longer to get all the achievements, but I think my effective gametime is around 30 minutes, the rest is due to lagg, loading or crashing)"

Does it feel worth it for 8p? Not really.The best thing I can equate this to is a 1 hour extended version of a mediocre song. It was alright the first time you tried it (level 1, so to say), but it drives you insane very quickly after that, since it is all on the same map with either a new spawner or the infected have more health to draw it out even more.  not to mention the constant achievement popups for killing two zombies. The in game audio will very quickly annoy you, with no ingame option to change sound from what I could see (had to use windows volume mixer to mute the game so I could listen to something more enjoyable via the steam web browser). If the ridiculous amount of achievements and how unbelievably frequent was meant to be a joke, it could have been far better executed, since the constant achievement pop up is extremely aggravating.I can see that the developer tried to do something, but the game feels very unpolished. The gun icons for the ammo do not match up to the weapon be used, especially with the machine gun which has an AK on the ammo bar. An ammo bar is also a bad idea, since it does not give as clear of an idea as a traditional ammo count. The infected and the cyborgs also do not seem to have a fully programmed death animation, since most of them go into a T-pose and then flop onto the ground.

Stopping at each station you fight hordes of zombies spawning out of destroyable generators. So far for the story.It's remarkable that all subway stations look the same. There's a station floor and a underground floor. Just the number of generators increases with each level but the positions aren't very surisingly. That supports the first impression that you are fighting on a very tight and boring single map all the time. Like on Killing Floor's 2 map ""Burning Paris"" only the small part inside the subway.In the first half hour of gameplay I didn't even understand the game concept. After killing 1k zombies and watch the 580 achievements popup for each of 2 kills there was still no progress and aim. And the so-called sidemissions are just secondary aims like make 100 headshots for weapon unlocks.Until I found out you can run to these strange generators and destroy them with a few shotgun shots. Then comes the most ridiculous bossfight against the cyborg which looks like a very rude model steal of Hans Volter (KF2) which his glowing twinfangs. Apropos some Unity assets can be found like the uninspired zombie models or the Subway station in parts. From the gameplay and gore view it's a very cheap simulation of KF2. Somekind of repetive, undetailed, boring disappointment.My highest level I reached was Station 9 of 12 levels. Due to unexplainable reinforcement zombie spawns after even destroying some generators the small map got stuffed with zombies and unkiteable anymore. Thankfully the achievement ""beat 12 levels"" counts accumultative on replaying the earlier maps.So in conclusion: nice try, but way too unpolished, lazy and cheap."

Its rather headache inducing. Also the game suffers from long load times for its single map. You died and want to try again.... Hold on.... hold on.... Its loading... ok finally loaded the only level in the game.Complete garbage with no redeeming valie. Avoid.Update:An option menu has been added I will have to see if changing the settings improves the experience. Nice work Dev, but its a good idea to include this before release."

,Not Recommended,576560,30128076,Posted: 23 February,all,だてんし - Ultra,"Quick note before starting: I crafted a badge and got a 90% off coupon for this game, so I only paid 11 cents CAD instead of the full price.Alright, so this game is really short. I will make a list that sums up the whole game and put a grade for each point. + = Good  ~ = Medium  - = Not good- All you do is shoot, run with infinite ammos and break spawners (electric generators).- There are 12 levels, but in reality, its 1 level 12 times. There only one extra spawner that appears each time you complete a level. Those spawners also become more resistant, at a point that in last levels you will need a whole machine gun ammo clip to destroy one.+ After completing a few levels (like 3 or 4), there extra zombies that appear as reinforcement to make the game a bit more difficult.~ Game over? You start all over. You only have one life. To be fair, the game is very short and there the next point below.~ When you kill zombies, you regenerate health. When you get the upgraded ""health on kill"" buff, you can easily Leeroy Jenkins an horde of 50 zombies if you hold your fire button with a rifle or machine gun equipped, and beat the game easily.+ Oh and speaking of the buff I mentionned previously, there actually ""bonus missions"" that you can do to unlock stuff like extra health, the ""health on kill"", but also weapons which are the shotgun, rifle and machine gun.- How much time did fun last? Around 30 minutes.- There barely is any difference between difficulty levels. Honestly, I think I didn't see any. Just get the machine gun and the ""health on kill"" upgrade in 3rd-4th levels and boom you easily beat the game, even on hardest (nightmare) difficulty. To make it short, get them and ""you're winner"" (Reference to Big Rigs).- The achievements. Oh god bloody hell... those achievements... 590 achievements. That's wayyyyy too much. 80% of them are just useless. I got all of them in 80 minutes. I could almost bet that some people suspected their friends of using Steam Achievement Manager, but the achievements are way too easy to use it (right now, 32.8% of people have all achievements of this game). SAM is not even legit anyway.To get all achievements, you must: Complete 12 levels (No need to complete all of them ), Kill 1000 zombies (you get one achievement for every 2 zombies, which equals 500 achievements), fire 104 times with you pistol, 52 times with your shotgun, 130 times with your rifle. I'm sure they can all be done in one single run.The last thing I have to do is to get the remaining card drops.To conclude: With the content this game has, yes it was worthing the 11 cents I paid for this game. If you plan buying it full price (1.09$ CAD), don't. Its better if the game is either on sale or if you have a coupon to buy it cheaper. The only worthy things are the card drops and the achievement. I do not say that I am cheap, but an achievement is an achievement.Quick question: Was this game made with Unity? I worked a few times with this game engine and this game reminds me of it.Bonus thing I noticed. On difficulty select screen, there is a typo in the tip about the shotgun at the bottom of the screen. It says ""your"" instead of ""you're"" near the end of the tip."

,Recommended,576560,29655642,Posted: 2 February,all,GeoLuz 🎮💯👊🤙,"Pain Train is a very basic FPS set inside a famous subway station in New York City called Herald Square. The game is about zombies infesting the subway station and you, as the anonymous protagonist, must kill zombies and the cyborg boss that appears at the end. You deliver the pain in Pain Train. That is all there is to know about the narrative of the game.The game is divided into 12 levels, but each level is the same in design and the zombies basically look the same. Zombies come out of the various spawning machines scattered around the train station, both upstairs and downstairs. The objective is to destroy each spawner to lessen the hordes of zombies. After destroying all spawning machines the cyborg boss comes out and is invincible until you destroy the generators connected to him. There are bonus objectives such as a set number of headshots and destroying a set number of spawning machines for more powerful weapons such as a shotgun and an assault rifle. There are also new abilities to gain after completing bonus missions such as the ability to move faster while shooting. The levels are so monotonous that the cyborg looks like the same mastermind in each level. The higher levels are more challenging, as they include more spawning machines to destroy and spawning machines with more hit points.The graphics are somewhat decent by today’s standards, but there was some clipping especially when zombies were crawling on the floor. The graphics, like the gameplay, are quite monotonous because every level is set in the same train station. This game does not have much variety in level design or gameplay.What this game has plenty of is achievements. There are 590 achievements to earn and I managed to earn all of them in about 1 hour, including completing all 12 levels. I think that this is the aspect of the game you can get the most for your $0.99. If this game had cost even $5.00 I would’ve completely trashed this game for its repetitive levels. Each level begins with a train entering the station and when you look around there are hordes of zombies to kill and they will not stop coming until you have destroyed the spawning machines. There are really no save points in this game, so if you die in any level you must restart the game from level 1. If you have enough experience with FPS games you will have enough strategy to finish all 12 gory levels in a short time without dying once. I played it in normal mode, but after I finished it I did not feel the enthusiasm to play the remaining two modes, hard and nightmare. This is due to the monotony and repetitive nature of the game. In other words, it feels like a game with low replay value. However, I cannot expect too much from a game that is so cheap at $0.99.I would conditionally recommend Pain Train. What I mean by ‘conditionally recommend’ is that you should buy this game if you truly desire to gain 590 achievements. I think getting the achievements and the entertainment value you get from a short game are worth your $0.99. If you have no desire to gain 500+ achievements, you should consider other FPS games on the Steam store. I might as well call this game Achievement Train.My Score: 6/10"

Once you kill all the spawners in a level, you are tasked with taking down a boss's shield generators and then finally the boss.Each level is the same environment, a subway station. Some variety here could have gone a long way.Every so often you're given a weapon upgrade. All weapons have infinite ammo.There are also challenges to meet (such as getting a certain number of headshots). Each challenge completed gives you an upgrade such as more HP or life steal. Unfortunately there aren't many of these challenges and you'll go through them pretty quick.While not a particularly original or long game, I still had fun with it.

,Recommended,576560,29343785,Posted: 18 January,all,DePhoegon,"Honestly.. This 'Game'  ... Well, it's good in the way Bad 'B' Movies are.  I can't really complain about it or site any real problems, outside some really poor loading times.Easy enough to beat fully (all achievements, as well)No real challange past taking the time to get the 2nd & 3rd 'objectives'--Which honestly would be needed if you care to remain sane in the later levels, for even one run throughGood for a quick few minutes of slaughtering 'zombies'A few faults would lie in 'reinforcements' if you want to call them that, always spawn from the same place,--Random locations would have atleast made it half way interestingThe 'Boss' at the end of each level can get literally stuck behind the zombies.-- Which makes the later levels honestly.... easier to do the 'boss' then to deal with the spawners before hand.Crawling zombies can easily hide under bodies.  (which might be the point, but still rather ...  annoying if you stand still)Does not communicate you can switch weapons.  [Which is fair enough, except for when you need to unglitch a gun or use a gun that can actually pull headshots off]Every 'Objective' is completed naturally except-100 Head shots [Easy enough], but the shotgun which you will have (for killing 20 zombies) isn't able to get headshots easily, as in I've pulled less then 10 shotgun headshots through the entire time, and you need to use the Pistol which it doesn't tell you how to switch.- Take 200 Damage, [Well easy enough, and is more threatening then is seems]--- Best done on level 1 or 2, leaving one spawner up and 'using' the regen on hitting enemies mechanic [which is never really explained]  letting one enemy hit you till you're low, and just kill them in untill you regain enough, and repeat.--- Best done lvl 3 or before. [as the rest of the objectives are based on elements of level progression, and it's best to not tempt fate by completing it after you complete the other objectives.-- Really not smart to try it on lvl 5+  (as the guns, you'll have just aren't enough)Early levels are more risky then later levels.-- It doesn't drag-on, but perhaps allowing some minor annoyances to show through.Slow Loading times on a system with a RAID 0 & GTX 950I had only 1 death, because I'd not noticed the regen on enemy hits.2 level lockups (requring ALT+F4 to exit)--Both where triggered when I used the steam overlay on the loading bit of a level when the train pulls inExceptionally slow loading times.-First time I assumed it was for a big batch of transcoding TS files into MP4 (changing ac3 to aac in them) & RAW AVI writing to a seperate SSD in the system, Though equally as slow loading times when nothing was happening.Fully completed the game in just over an hour, with about  10 minutes wasted on the first failed run, & 5 in menus overall.--Not even enough time to get all the card drops.Kinda wish the weapons where more animated.. the LMG has no real animations.This may be a big bunch of assets, but honestly  I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ because it's solid enough and it's really not that bad or offensive.   In short it's fun enough for alittle bit of kicking around, and silly enough for a pack of achievements that for once aren't a nightmare to get, or even time consuming really."

I played on Nightmare and it was really easy considering you have to do Missions (shoot that money Headshots etc) to get better Weapons and/or more Health or Speed.To gett all Achievements you need like 30 Minutes or so, not very much.Downside is that the game runs on 1000000 FPS without Vsync in the Game your GPU will run at Maximum Speed and you will hear your Fans the first time.The Devs already said they will patch a Option in to the Game which caps the FPS to 200.If you like to shoot and have 1$ left over, enjoy!"

I used a coupon to get this game for even cheaper than it already is. In my opinion, it is definitely worth the .99 cents it costs to play it. The later levels seemed to get a little repetitive but I could tell that the hordes of zombies were coming faster than the previous level. The game is not perfect, but I didn't expect much when I bought it for so cheap. I will be picking up Pain Train 2 as soon as it comes out. Also, this game is great for achievement hunters!"

I had expected coming in to this for the game to be another one of those cheap games just made to get some quick money. I was wrong. PAIN TRAIN was one of the most refreshing, new, innovative, and unique gameplay experiences I have had in a very long time. The game starts you off at, ofcourse, the PAIN TRAIN and you step off and immediately get into fast paced, heart racing, adrenaline pumping fights against 2 zombie spawners. this is truly a challenging game at first but once mastered it is a-lot of fun.Overall review 9.5/10-0.5 because it crashed .1hrs in and stopped playing there."
