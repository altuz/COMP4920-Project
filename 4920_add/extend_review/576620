,Recommended,576620,29053569,Posted: 5 January,all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","The Puzzle Room is another one of the good ones, and judging from the menu there's more coming in addition to the two rooms the game already has. There's a lot of things to play with, hats to wear, things to paint on, and puzzles to solve, and that makes this one feel unique; not everything in these rooms are related to the puzzles, some things are just there to let you wind down and spray paint the walls or put on a Vader helmet and swing around a lightsaber for the fun of it. The second room may or may not have a problem because one of the keys on the computer's keyboard doesn't work for me that may be required for the answer, but otherwise this is a firm contender for ""one of the good ones"" in the Escape Room VR category."

Make sure you have bigger room scale than the minimum, 1st room is ok but in the second one you need about 2,5m x 3m space. Cleared the 2nd room ok, very solid experience and fun to solve. 1st didnt start off too well, have to give it a new try. Waiting for new rooms on this one!"
,Not Recommended,576620,33726168,Posted: 22 July,all,DeadGavin,"Short Version: This game, althrough better that it's successor, is way too short and uncreative for a $13 dollar entry price.Length: This game too me around an hour to complete, but that was extended 20 minutes becauseI didn't see a puzzle piece on the roof in the second roomand since I had an issue withthe brain in the third room not allowing the key to come out of the dummies body.Also, I spent 10 minutes shooting the gun and buildiung the robot in the spawn room. So what essentially is a 40-50 minute game should not cost 13 dollars for puzzles that does not offer anything new or too interesting.Puzzles: Some of the puzzles were cool. None of them took much thinking which, for me, is what makes escape room games fun. While the puzzles were fairly simple, they were sometimes fun to solve. I will not go into depth just in case of people not wanting to know what puzzles they should be looking out for in the game.Why do I not recomend this: I know I liked some of the puzzles, but none of them were unbelieveably cool. If the game was a little longer, the puzzles were a little bit more though provoking, or the game a little bit cheaper I would have recomended it, but that is not the case."
,Not Recommended,576620,32062312,Posted: 30 May,all,JadeK,"In this game are three different rooms, each with a different theme, and you need to complete a series of tasks to find the key for each room and escape. Room 2 and 3 are enjoyable, the design in these rooms are good, the puzzles are of a medium difficulty and Room 2 was the most enjoyable because there was interactivity with many of the items in the room, an additional mini shooter game to play, and the room is the most detailed of the three in it’s design. However, music was again absent in this room and also room 3. The game could do with a series of improvements to be up to par when compared with other VR escape the room type games. Although the puzzles are of a reasonable medium difficulty, the design is lacking and feels unfinished. The game is also overpriced for what it offers, the room designs should be more detailed, music should be available, more rooms should be added. I don’t recommend this game simply because there are many other VR escape the room games that offer better value for money. Overall, the game feels overpriced and unfinished. Additionally, there also seems to be a problem with the physics – In Room 2 I flew out of the window and had to restart, and in Room 3 my mouse got lost in the wall and I had to restart that room as that was the only option available (both of these moments have been left in my let’s plays so that viewers can see this problem). That therefore impacted the enjoyability of the gameplay as this problem results in less immersion.https://youtu.be/Uw3NNCrdl9E"

It puts you in a room where you are trapped yet you have freedom to interact with almost everyth single aspect of that room. The game at its current state is not to hard, but if you are one to mess around in vr you can easily waste time in this game and still have fun. Currently it only has 2 rooms to escape from. The first room being short and easy yet still fun. While the second room feels the developers put more time into it to make it a little longer. Both rooms are still fun and possible to complete. If you are looking for an escape the room for a decent price and future updates the price on this game is pretty resonable. Id reccomend this game to anyone looking to escape a room or two, and definitely reccomend throwing some friends into the game aswell."

All objects interact the way you expect them to, and each room really has its own flavour.  Currently three rooms available, but it seems like the dev is actively adding more, which is great!"

I really hope they add a teleprt feture for those of us without massize rooms. Despite this what i played was really fun and i would recomend it to anyone who likes somlive puzzles.P.S. Please release a teleport even if its optinal so as to not ruin the experiance for people with bigger rooms :)
,Recommended,576620,30120368,Posted: 23 February,all,ForbiddenWolfie,"Honestly, I really liked the idea and concept of this game but, what really annoys me is that the game isn't really rendered toward your room scale expectations to your play area. And some things I can't even get to because of that, for example, Job Simulator actually adjusts itself to your play area so you don't have to worry about going out your boundries you have made when your first got VR. Now, I'm not saying this isn't a great game, it is! I really like puzzle rooms in VR, and this is one of them. I suggest you try to make that fix if you want people to try your game. But, this game isn't really worth $12.99 for the state it is in right now. I reccomend that you wait till there is a sale, and try to go from there. In conclusion, great concept, needs fixing."

76561197972337172,Recommended,576620,30345511,Posted: 5 March,all,o_O,"It's unfinished, but there is a lot of potential here. This VR game is like the job similator of room escapes, at least it tries to mimic job simulator in terms of the style of art and it's lightheartedness. However, there is no story (which isn't the end of the world considering it's a room escape), and there are currently only 2 very short escape rooms (hopefully more are coming). My personal opinion is that people should take a wait and see approach. It's kind of an interseting demo at the moment, but If the developers add more content then I think it is a definite buy."

,Recommended,576620,29708117,Posted: 4 February,all,Wally,"The Puzzle Room has a lot of different cool things, including a suprise Johnny Five, i'll list the pros and cons for the current version:Pros:*A lot of puzzles, you need to think here, and is very challenging* Johnny Five* You can change your hairstyle and see yourself in reflections.* Two rooms you can play in.* Spray Paint* Playable Records.Cons:* Sadly the game crashes a lot, not sure why..* First puzzle was not completable in one segment as the flashlight would not work in the secret section, had to restart game.* You can't fully assemble Johnny five ( No Disassemble :()* A little expensive for how buggy it is right now.Overall I believe this game has potential but I would wait until the bugs are fixed or it's on sale."

,Recommended,576620,30062460,Posted: 20 February,all,Braddigan,"Nice little puzzle room game that you can get a half hour out of.  Nothing too challenging.  Most puzzles involve finding objects in the room or finding numbers.  There are a few more interesting ones in there but not many.  Only two rooms, the first one being fairly straight forward and the second one being a jumbled mess with some references mixed in.  Hopefully they release more."
