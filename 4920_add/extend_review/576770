You collect loot and manage the inventory. You can sell, upgrade, buy, and craft loot. You level up and gain better abilities. You can customize your party. All the numbers are transparent as far as the battle system goes.The 'arena' mode is currently fully implemented (6/2017), but the story/campaign mode is not available yet. Don't sweat it - I do think this will be delivered upon BUT it doesn't matter - it's worth it in it's current state. The arena mode will keep you busy for (probably) dozens of hours.Pros:+Addicting RPG tactics gameplay that you want out of this sort of title+Coffee break/quick run gameplay is great+Steam cloud and easy save system is perfect for this kind of deal+Managing the party is fun and feels good+You can get away with only using the mouse (part of the 'coffee break' deal), but keyboard adds additional functionalityCons:-The party members avatars look like they were cut from the covers of romance novelsIf the trailer interests you - I assure that you will not be disapointed.Worth more than full price easy cheesy."
,Recommended,576770,32632400,Posted: 21 June,all,Moofy,"Been looking for a straightforward turn based DnD/Pathfinder simulator? I know of none better.  The game needs polish but is super fun and has a lot of room for the addition of more classes/races/etc.  If you don't have nostalgia for old school graphics or can't look past them, maybe play something else.  That said I love where the game is now and I'm looking forward to seeing it grow.Low Magic Age has helped me scratch my tactical RPG itch with an emphasis on the DnD combat model; there are practically no good turn-based games like this.  Thank you for this game!(My sole complaint thus far, actually, is the numerous boring boss fights with giant ants.  Would like to see more variety in the boss fights.)"
,Recommended,576770,30400994,Posted: 8 March,all,Rafael M.,"Low Magic Age is a great surprise; a real hidden gem. This game had a good but warm reception at launch, because it was only in available in chinese. At the end of February, more specifically on the 24th, the English version was released, with a great translation, by the way. At the moment, Low Magic Age has only one game mode: Arena. In it, you will fight several randomly generated battles on procedural scenarios. You have to win four battles, plus another one with with a greater difficulty (which serves as a kind of boss) to proceed. Fight, reach the next wave and repeat - that's it. As the game is still being balanced, you will face occasionally a situation where victory is not possible - with enemies knocking down your entire team in three hits, for example. Luckily, you can generate a new set of battles by paying a certain amount of the currency used in the game. This includes the possibility of choosing a specific difficulty level, which is cool to make a grind to collect money and equipment. Yes, random gear is won after a victory. In total, there are over 100 different monsters and over 100 different items.The ability to hit or miss a hit, including critical hits, is entirely based on the d20 System. Thanks to the Open Gaming License (OGL) from Wizards of the Coast, a publisher specializing in tabletop RPGs and collectible card games, the developers of Low Magic Age were able to freely use this system, which came from the tabletop RPGs. To make everything clearer to the player, the battle log details the numbers that were taken and why they resulted in a hit or miss. Although this information is easy to consult, you must also take into account factors such as variables (more or less) caused by the equipment used, as well as the status of the characters.While the Arena Mode can entertain you for many hours, keep in mind that the universe of the game will be greatly expanded. In future, devs will add a Sandbox mode, which is infinite and customizable, and Adventure mode, which will be an open world campaign, with procedurally generated dungeons and permanent death, as well as Tales of Maj'Eyal (ToME). And speaking of Tales of Maj'Eyal, the similarity in the graphics is no mere coincidence. The developers of Low Magic Age acquired a package of tilesets made by Raymond E. Gaustadnes (Shockbolt), the same one who created the arts for ToME. What for some may seem strange, to me it's great, because it reminds me of this roguelike that I like so much (but there are also one or another tileset not used in ToME).Low Magic Age must remain in Early Access for at least six months, but this time may vary according to the demand. It's worth mentioning that the team that develops the game is always listening to suggestions, criticisms and answering questions in the forums. If you are interested in the game, I recommend getting it now, not only because the price will go up later, but also because it is quite fun, well done, and with a beautiful soundtrack."

Imagine my surprise at this hidden gem.  Just a very excellently thought out and executed game.For those, like me, who bang their head against their keyboard at character creation in DnD games (best way to do it if you can't figure out if Will is better than Charisma) LMA gives you pre-created groups and assigns points at level up and chooses feats.  OMFG, what a relief.  And, what do you know?  It works.  I have all the fun of outfitting my guys, crushing my opponents, figuring out my strategy and learning how to play without spending untold minutes forcing my brain to grapple with the concept of feats.Ya, ya, laugh at me all you DnD nerds who I secretly admire for the way your brains apparently work.  Since this game allows you to create your own characters and parties and manually level up, it has everything you want to enjoy your DnD torture chamber.While the rest of us STILL get to enjoy the game.  Super!Even though in EA, highly recommend.  Extremely enjoyable and satisfying."

76561198006449264,Recommended,576770,31330125,Posted: 23 April,all,xodarap777,"I was going to thumb this down, but then I realized that I'm 6 hours in and plan to play more, despite the other titles in my Library calling...It's DnD 3.5 (pathfinder) as a TBS.  It's just an ""arena,"" but it plays out like an old-school dungeon crawl because of the way the loot works.  The huge negative to the game, right now, is that you're limited to the most basic of classes: fighter, cleric, rogue, mage.  And no multiclassing.I can't position my crew before a fight, so if I get ambushed, my mage and rogue get one-shot.  No prestige classes or multiclassing means I can't really level them in a way that can protect them.  The rogue is hugely underpowered because there are no traps or skillchecks, and the game's mechanics favor armor far, far above dodge.  So... don't make a rogue.Wizards not only get one-shot, but all of their spells share an ugly CD mechanic, so they spent 2/3s of their time shooting a crossbow or flinging a sling - which they really aren't good at.  With the over-the-top armor mechanics, this equates to a 5% hit chance.  Big spells like sleep are handy, once, but mages end up being highly expendable.Ranged is too underpowered to work.  It's easy to get stuck in melee or unable to shoot around a chokepoint.  In the end, the armor mechanics make it too hard to land a shot - even if you've built a fighter *entirely* around the longbow, with every possible feat and stat in line - you're still looking at 25% chance to hit a well-armored enemy.  Don't make a ranger.You want to win?  Make three battle clerics and three 2H warriors.  Find immunities (through races or equip).  There: you'll own everything.The game needs to rebalance because the settings and set-ups aren't DnD.  Rogues' backstab, for example, only seems to work if the enemy is flat-footed.  There are no ""facing"" mechanics, so you don't get to BACK-stab.  Even when you do, the damage isn't on-par, remotely, with a 2H warrior who can also take way more hits AND avoid those hits far more often with their armor.3.5 wasn't well-balanced in the TBS sense.  It was a matter of teamwork, keeping that mage in the back and relying on a well-timed spell.  Battle after battle in an arena, with no pre-buffing, constant ""rest"" periods, etc., this game needs serious balancing.  And a lot more classes.Promise and potential.  This is a 50/50 thumb-up, thumb-down."

I cannot wait for more contents!So far, it's an arena game were you can fights packs of monsters and villains turn by turn.  After a win, you receive experience, glory points (which are use to get some (out of arena) advantages, gold and sometime magic items.All pack of monster have an assigned combat difficulty, and you can refresh the offered packs with gold to have a new one of the same level (easy, average and hard).  More strong the opponent, more rewards.You can create a party of 1 to 6 characters with some of the most iconic D&D classes (Cleric, Rogue, Fighter, Wizard and Barbarian)  and races (Human, Elf, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Halfling, Gnome, Dwarf), and select feat and spell as available.It's so fun! It's a good game if you want to play a couple of games and take a break with this one.  I'm so eager to see all the content that they want to add, as more classes, races, a campain, more spell... A lot of good stuff that will make the game even more replayable and deep.Good Jobs so far, keep it up"

It's using a basic idea that works incredibly well. The simplicity of design and the freedom that the player has in creating his own party of adventurers is what lacks in all of the current triple A titles.LMA is pretty much like ToME but with a party of 6 and based on D&D ruleset which really reminds me of the time i was playing Neverwinter Nights 1/2 with a bunch of friends. Currently the only available mode is Arena which let's your party progress through waves of enemies while constantly getting xp/gold/loot per win with a shop stocked with random goods that change after every encounter.So to summarize it is a turn based, survival D&D ""Spartacus"" meets ""Gladiator"" ToME looking fantasy game. :)I rarely bother to write a review but this game is gold. I wish the devs all the best and hope for a nice story/adventure mode in the future!"

It's essentially an AD&D rule set, roll up characters, build a party, and just fight. The fights are fairly simple, but they are fairly well balanced and fun to play. There's lots of loot and magic items. It's like a little combat-only D&D game. Totally worth it for such a small price!"

Although reading would add all the tidbits of info and immersion, so I am missing out on all background stats and details that surely I could use..I would recommend waiting for the english translation, although you can figure much out by the normally used mechanics of moves and skills, use of magic, melee, exp gain, purchases of weapons and armor types , drops, etc. Who gets what and uses best takes a bit of thinking, but fun anyways.Seems just arena right now, but I have not gone too deep into play choices. and again cant read a thing, but understand symbols and the usual context of things.Definite recommend watching this one."

Clearly its a big improvement over the gold box games tactical screen, everything is well laid out, and the ruleset they use offers much deeper character customisation.But yeah, if you remember the old gold box days, or even if you just want a proper D&D tactics game, look no further."

This is a fun small game to play to pass away some time while your inbetween games. There are a lot of magic items to find, monsters to fight and there is no limit to how many levels you can gain in the Arena basically alowing you to keep playing for as long as you want. I do believe the game will continue to get better and I have shared some ideas in their forum on how to make it even more interesting. I play a lot of games and this is one of the rare few ones you'll likely play for some time so for a low cost of $4 it's worth it as folks who buy it now will get the Adventure mode when it's released so I'd get it now before the price goes up as this game is worth more then the asking price so I'd take advantage of that."

,Recommended,576770,31538075,Posted: 4 May,all,Wafflecopper,"Thumbs up because for the low price it's pretty fun for a while. This comes with some big caveats however. Firstly, the game in its current form is very repetitive. You have to grind a lot of very similar battles against the same enemy configurations to unlock new, tougher enemies which actually mix up the gameplay a bit. Then you grind them instead until you get the next batch. This is mitigated somewhat by the random arenas and spawns so that the battles aren'tcompletelyidentical, but this brings its own problems: sometimes your squishier characters (eg mage) will spawn closest to the enemy, which can make them very difficult to protect. I even had one battle where my mage got killed before I took a single turn. Losing characters to pure RNG before you get to make a single decision is not fun.There are very few spells currently in the game so there's not much variety between mages. Clerics don't even get to pick spells, they just get given more every few levels. Spells are on a shared cooldown system, so you only get to cast one every 2-3 turns, which means you usually end up casting the same one or two most powerful spells (usually fireball once you get it, or the healing spell for clerics) and never using the rest. This doesn't help the repetitiveness of the gameplay at all.Also I have no idea what the devs were smoking when they came up with the title because wow guys it's D&D. My party are running around decked out in enchanted gear making them as strong as ogres while chucking lightning bolts at skeletons and summoning fire elementals. If that's low magic what the heck is high to you?TLDR: Fun for the price, but repetitive, shallow, and very rough around the edges. If it cost any more it'd be a thumbs down from me. The game shows promise though, and hopefully will improve as development continues."

Apart from 1 very minor not-even-wrong but quirky text on one button (still completely comprehensible!) everything seems just written by a native english speaker to me (I myself am not an english speaker however, nor have I scoured over all text with a magnifying glass).So the game currently exists of numerous challenges in random small maps versus different enemies.That may not sound too enticing, but it actually is.Here's why:1) you find items after a victory2) you get experience and level up3) you face progressively harder enemies with even a kind of 'endboss' every time you complete all current arena challenges4) there's a shop you can buy stuff from and sell stuff to. It has randomized items.Thinking about it, one could say the only things missing for this to make it a perfect turnbased party-based roguelike is:1) an overall quest/goal2) walking in-between the fights, having to pick up loot manually and stairs between the maps instead of the arena ui3) having to find the shops4) possibility of running away or sneaking past enemiesSo I guess that's why I am enjoying it so much, it's just fun turn-based combat very similar to D&D (maybe it's 100% the same even but that depends on what version of D&D and I have not kept track after AD&D 2nd).Don't get me wrong, I am very excited for the coming Adventure Mode, but if this seems to you to be your kind of game I'd recommend getting it, it's very probably worth the low cost :)EDIT: oh one noteworthy addendum: the AI seems to be above what you'd normally expect, my summoned air elemental took a deliberate attack of opportunity in order to attack three enemies at once with its AoE instead of staying put and just damaging that one enemy he was next to."

LMA is cheaper than a trip to Starbucks and has taught me aparently games do not need too much in the way of story, graphics, advertising, and unique gameplay mechanics to be fun to play. In fact Low Magic Age does nothing (that I'm aware of) to change the tried and true DnD combat formula. As always it's a system that works well and makes the game engaging even absent any background story or polish. LMA one game mode is Arena and you run from skirmish to skirmish with a chosen band of the usual rpg suspects. You get solid tactical combat with a proven combat formula featuring progression and not much else is really necessary. There are bonuses and penalities for being in certain positions (flanking, behind cover, etc.) and the RNG is setup in a way that allows for tension without wrecking a good strategy.Bottom line here is that Low Magic Age offers more than enough good times to justify forking over the $4 dollar US asking price and never look back.

Low Magic Age is like a love letter to all of us who played Dungeons and Dragons back in the days of 3.0. No you may not be able to play as every single monster race in the world and there are not any world shattering spells available yet but one thing is for certain and that is the mechanics that are present have been very carefully built to make a challenging yet fair game. Right now there is nothing more than an arena where you fight hordes of enemies varying from common human bandits to mythical beings straight out of nightmares and even corrupted animals who have grown to monstrous sizes with fiendish intelligence. Currently an adventure mode where you do normal DnD things like you would find in any pen and paper campaign is being developed. Personally this is the part of the game that snagged me when I first bought LMA half a year ago when it became available to the public. I can only imagine how amazing the adventures will be once the new mode is available and whole-heartedly anticipate its completion. All in all this is a ♥♥♥♥ing amazing game that is well worth your dollars and promises to offer many thousands of hours of entertainment just like the original pen and paper."

More magic, currently it is powerful, but i feel uderwhelmed by the amount of spells and AoE spells often just cancel each out, so there is not much variety.2. Basically, more options.

The game found a great balance for both types of players.The cons:Some players may find it a little repetitive. If you like other roguelikes this won't be a problem for you. If you don't know, $4 isn't too much to risk trying it out.Also the game is still in early access, so you are limited to 5 classes and a single game mode.

They do intend to make a campaign, but it doesn't exist yet, so there's no reason to assume it will be any good or even exist at all.

Only thing is that the challenge level of the fights are not always accurate. Sometimes a ""Normal"" fight is super challenging while a ""Hard"" fight is not. The most difficult battle for me thus far was against a party of archers using poisoned arrows. I had no defense against poison. Luckily, my tank was the last survivor and just barely finished off the archers. No matter who dies in combat, they always come back at full health for the next battle as long as there is at least one surviving party member. And there is no experience loss even when most of the party dies. If everyone dies then that is considered a loss and there will be an experience penalty. Lots of magical items. Good merchant system. Can even upgrade your equipment for a cost. Sorry, no crafting. Right now it's only arena combat with small maps, but throw in a story like gold box games of yore, increase map size, iron out difficulty system, add more spells -- a wizard for some reason does not have access to all his spells as their is no memorize system. Always create your own character. Otherwise at level-ups, the game chooses everything for you. There is enough here to wittle away lots of hours of enjoyment. I wouldn't pay more than $6.00 for the game as it is now. I got it for $3.99 and am very happy with my purchase. final note: beware battles with tons of minions because, even though i had a high level party, the minions all targeted my quishy mages and killed them before they got a chance to react. sometimes, a battle will start with your party being surrounded by enemies and their minions, which is not fair"

So my only comparison is the battle of Wesnoth.  LMA seem to be headed for an adventure mode not unlike Wesnoth.  The depth of the battles in LMA is better though.  At present, the game is not much more than just isolated battles linked together in the arena mode.  This does make the game seem small.  However, firstly, this is done very well.  It's not buggy and it's complex.  I can see I won't be mastering this quickly.  Secondly, the future addition of an adventure mode will definitely help playability.  There are also plans afoot for the multiplayer.  Thirdly, the devs are active and responsive.  This is great.For 4 euro, this is a good buy.  When they add on the adventure mode and multiplayer, this will be very good.Currently: 8/10."

The area at least (which is the part they have developed so far) doesn't have depth beyond the actual individual fights, but that's ok. It's a cheap game, it's coming along etc. If individual arena matches aren't your thing, wait until they've done more dev work and see how it ends up. You risk slamming it for being a bit one-dimensional, and given it's a work in progress I think it deserves time to see what it becomes.At its core though, I like turn based tactical fighting games, even simple ones like this is. And at this price, I say jump in. Keen to see what it's like when it 'grows up'. So I'm happy to give them support along the way. It cost me the price of a coffee FFS. Not going to criticise them when that's all they are asking of me!"

I kept and I occasionally play on it. It is a good game to pass some time and make you think hard on strategy. I  never played RPG turn based games like this but the game has made interested in the genre. The game is pretty friendly towards new players since theirs a wiki page on all the infromation in the game. The developers seem like nice people and they are working hard on the adventure mode which I am excited for. Overall its a good game and you are actually getting more than what you paid for. There are some complaints on the character skins but i think you can just get mods on it."

Even if they never added Adventure mode to this game, I would he happy with what I paid. Right now the game involves turn-based combat, collecting loot, leveling up your characters, buying/selling/crafting. So really it's an RPG without a story arc.

As I got older I got into games like Betrayal (and Return) at Krondor, Baldurs Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and Final Fantasy Tactics. I saw this game go on sale and it instantly caught my eye. I felt no remorse adding it to my cart and purchased it right away. Today I got to play it for the first time and have spent a few hours with it. I have enjoyed the pre-made group they provided me and look forward to creating my own group in the near future! Seeing as this is an early access game, it makes me excited to think about the content coming and that I will have a hand in testing. The Devs seem to be updating and patching regularly as well as taking community bug reports and suggestions into consideration. I look very much forward to growing along with this game.If you are looking for a team based, turn based, tile based, old school D&D ruled, digital tabletop experience, this could be a really great game for you. The Wizards of the Coast Open Gaming License is at use here as well as lots of familiar things from D&D v3.5. If you are familiar with the tabletop, a lot of things will be familiar to you. If you are not familiar with the tabletop, this game would be an awesomely smooth transition for you into seeing what rolls and modifiers from feats and stats do for each character.Very cool game to say the least, and I hope everyone finds it as intriguing as I do! Supporting this developer seems like a good move.Sincerely,~Eldaran"

But I'm getting the hang of it, it's not overly difficult so far. It's like Pillars of Eternity or stuff like that. Pretty cool. Arena type of thing, you fight more and more battles that progressively get more difficult as you go along. Grind your party up, gear them, get stronger. Take the next challenge, the next boss, etc. Pretty much what it boils down to so far, and for the price, it's a steal! In 3 hours I got my money worth already. Definitely.

Despite the game's cool title, there's actually plenty of magic to sling around if you pick a caster.It currently has an Arena mode, where you select 6 custom or premade party members and face against a variety of monsters in randomly generated arenas. Light of sight and fog of war affect what you can see and strike. Most actions can be done through context, click on an empty space to go there, click on your unit to stand up or defend, click on enemies to attack. Then there is a hotbar at the bottom with all your skills and spells. Everything has tabs when you mouse over, and highlighted keywords can further be moused over to explain stats or effects.Despite being pretty faithful to 3.5 D&D, the game plays very quickly, with simple graphicss, animations, and effects not taking up time being gratuitous. Combats last only minutes and while music and sound effects are likewise simple and could use some punching up (I think), combat still has a tense feeling of the brutal, albeit limited, low level combat of D&D. If you can beat a battle without having anybody hit 0 HP, you'll get a gold bonus and a couple random items.Between arena battles There is a shop available, which restocks a few random magic items between bouts, and a stable of plain weapons, armor, and ammo. YOu can also sell old and uneeded gear. You'll then be able to level and equip your party before heading back into battle, and that's essentially the gameplay loop.Fight, Level, Gear up!The game is still in development, with an adventure mode as well as other features to come! In it's current state, if you like D&D, tactics, and/or SRPGs, get it for it's low price point and fast combat and know there's more to come."

I'd give this game a good score.But when adventure mode comes out, look out.
