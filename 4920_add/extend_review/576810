,Not Recommended,576810,31264641,Posted: 20 April,all,Kovic,"-Movement controls are a bit too sensitive-Jump button works sluggishly, most likely because of the Ninja Gaiden'esque jumping animation. (tried with keyboard and controller = same result)-Moving camera during levels is disorienting when trying to make jumps, especially with the precision jumps required in certain areas.This could of been okay if the most important thing in a platformer, the controls, were better."

There are 7 levels, 2 bosses, and they also give you a checkpoint after each tough part of the level.The humor is VERY stupid, but I find stupid humor funny, so I enjoyed it For $0.99, I would most definitely recommend the game if you like platformers, and humor like Monty Python or Kung Pow - Enter the Fist.The dev asked me to post my gameplay here, so check it out if you'd like:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhMaLw-ggxk&t=81s"

76561198043115858,Recommended,576810,29736944,Posted: 6 February,all,Vitamin Ex,"It plays just like the old Shinobi games.It's a combination of both action and platforming. There are sections when you're going to need a perfectly timed jump in order to clear a section. There are enemies as well as boss fights which is a nice break from the platforming. Each level has several checkpoints, and a nice auto-save feature that will save not only the level you were last on but also which checkpoint you were at on that level.A lot of people have been bashing the game because of the name and the silly plot of the game, but if you look past that you'll find a rather enjoyable indie game that has a real retro feel to it. I really don't see how a name can make a game bad.For speedrunners, this is a game worthy of speedrunning. No annoying global-timers to worry about. Stages are independent which makes it easy for FS splits or IL times. The game also runs real smooth, so no lag issues to worry about."

This meme filled rage game is not an enjoyable time at all. With mismatched graphics that range from decent pixel art to crap clipart, terrible voice acting, and the least fun checkpoint gauntlets I have seen in a long time, please don't waste your time like I did. If you already own this game because of a sale or bundle, first, my condolences, second, just idle for cards and uninstall.Also, this game ends with a♥♥♥♥♥♥shapped tank, and it wasn't even a well done♥♥♥♥♥♥tank."

This makes the game pretty diffucult and really frustrating.But the worst thing of all is: you will get addicted. YOU CAN'T STOP PLAYING ANYMORE. you need to get to the next checkpoint and even your girlfriend in underwear won't stop you from reaching your goal.This is why i will give this a positive rating without a doubt. I recommened this game!"

,Not Recommended,576810,30325836,Posted: 4 March,all,danmerey,"Very poor game, looks like the first game of newbie game developer. Well, the cost is pretty low, but still worth refunding :DI love quality hardcore platformers. That's why I do not recommend this game. Yes, this game is hard, but not because it's well designed, but because of bad controls and unfinished game mechanics. If you are looking for funny plot, you will find it in trailer, but not in game.Cons:- Not polished frustrating platformer controls:1) No remembering pre-pressed jump button – so if you are in air near ground and pre-press Jump, you will not jump after landing even if you are holding the button)2) Can't stop moving by X in air – you can just switch direction from left to right and from right to left), so it's pretty annoying when you have to aim while jumping.3) Stick is not supported for Xbox controller which is bad for platformer.- Bad camera behaviour, just feel uncomfortable.- Very poor sprite graphics and animation: low ammount of sprites, not smooth transition between animations and changing direction of character, bad resolution and quality of sprites and textures.- Didn't find any intros or cinematics in game that were trailer.Pros:- Developers read my first review and fixed critical bug (I couldn't jump), so I bought the game second time after refunding it (well, I will still try to refund it second time).- Pretty funny trailer (didn't find anything in game though).- Low price, but still the Game shouldn't be in Steam in current state."

LOVE IT :D It's everything the description promised! It is mindbogglingly frustrating and just as pleasing when you reach a checkpoint. I died 348 times during the YouTube recording (Yes, I did count them all).Pros:- Cheap as f***.- Funny dialog (because it's sooooo bad).- Good old classic platform gaming when its best.- Major gratification when you reach a checkpoint after 200+ tries.- There's a freaking♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Tank!Cons:- The music tends to be rather uniform... especially when you've died for the 129'th time!- A few more checkpoints would be nice.- I expected more reference to the ""original work""."

It makes it quite cringy instead.But platforming is on point. Character's movements are sharp and responsive... Sometimes too responsive, which may lead to unnecesary frustration."
