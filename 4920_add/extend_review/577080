,Not Recommended,577080,29382006,Posted: 20 January,all,Digaly,"This game isn't funny nor scary, wanna know why?The actual gameplay sucks♥♥♥♥♥The mechanics are very glitchy, making the experience frustrating rather than terrifying.Here's some things that would make it better:- Make dragging the little guys not as cumbersome and truly frustrating, they fly all over the place, break too easily and fall too easily. You have to drag them with the patience like you're defusing a mine, it's ridiculous- In the baby crib level, objects start flying all over the place, sometimes right in your view and blocking your ♥♥♥♥♥. I died from the huge baby behind thanks to simply my ♥♥♥♥♥ not going anywhere despite me frantically clicking.- The indication for when your cooldown is active is unclear while shooting, especially during the first level- It seems if you start holding right click while the cooldown is still active, but you hold your click until past the cooldown, you won't♥♥♥♥♥♥after releasing the mouse button anyway. This makes shooting extra frustratingPros:- Great scary environments, very nicely detailed characters and props, looks out of this world- Nice ♥♥♥♥♥"

Doom is about killing demons and it does it well. For a game that is about ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the dark...It doesn’t do it well... It also has a whole bunch of other stuff in there I honestly don’t know what was going on. The developer has written this like script for these minigames or scenes which is so convoluted and boring.... you just sit there and poop. Whilst the novelty of Goat Simulator might last an hour before getting bored, the novelty in this game lasts around 60 seconds before you're left questioning what the ♥♥♥♥ is the point of this game.THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED and proving my point at how any shmuck can now make a game on unity and charge money for it.

I wouldn't call it black humour, or gallows humour, because it's straight horror with a twist.  reminds me of American McGee's Alice."

NOPE1. maybe its just my poor graphics card but i cant hardly see jack sh*t in this game2. the idea of playing a BUTT that contiuously shoots sh*t's like a gun3. i was able to even sh*t on my pet bird4. its not even a game... there is no w.a.s.d keys to move around5. sometimes you have to wait for someone to say something, and in the meantime you do nothing6. sometimes you have no f-ing idea what you're suppose to even do, like when you're being dragged by a lady and a man with a hatchet comes after you. you can sh*t on him all you want and he wont die7. charater has no arms or legs, so just like a dirty conservitive. this avatar thinks his sh*t dont stink8. sometimes its like hearing a kid joke a little too much. i think the farts were over killthe good thing about this game is...1. its much different from any other story game ive ever played2. you cant find too many dark humored games out there because people are afraid of a challange3. the idea that the developers have is very unique, its too bad you cant hardly see anything4. i think the name of this story game is perfect and lives up to its name5. it seems to be funny at first, but because i have poor graphics im probably not getting the best out of iti cant recommend it now though, the main title appears inside the game instead before the game starts. there really is no storyline to why im a butt...and im not really digging the optimization here. but i did like the price tag....i think its worth at least $3. you have a deal there. thanks for the cheap laugh"
,Recommended,577080,29215389,Posted: 12 January,all,「SUNBOAT」,"For the year wait for this product, I have to say that I LOVE how the horror is actually executed. It's not a walk around the corner get spooked sorta thing. There's no jumpscares. It's a decent horror game, on it's own.. Y'know. Without the butts. And the poop. But, those two aspects actually help the game on certain parts. As you don't know who you are, or what body you belong to. All you know is, is that you're a butt. And you must poop. However, the preformance isn't that good. It's also, made in unity. So Nvidia users like myself, tend to have a rough time trying to make these games work. Regardless, it's a great concept, making it become a seriously grand idea. It, however. Isn't executed properly. My main problem with the game, is that.. You don't know when you die. And you tend to not know how to prevent it. No directions tends to be a double-edged sword, and being unable to have checkpoints, and the blindness of it all, tends to make you restart from 10-20 minutes ago, having the majority of the time being wasted on atmosphere, not chasing. Just things slowly setting in. The mouse controls also feel off, probably because there aren't that many games in this sort-of perspective, and it should probably be played with a VR headset. But, still. It's playable. I'm so glad that the game's this polished, but I'm utterly dissapointed that it isn't fine tuned, nor polished enough. It's more like a $1-2 game, and I'd definently say it's worth more if problems are fixed and content is added. But for now, I can only say that if you want to see the game grow. Buy it. See how it is, and see if you can put up with the issues.I'm not really a fan of horror games, I never was. They always made me straight out blow my brown load. However, this one's jsut right. It gives you a turtle-head, before letting the dam give sweet release.Continue the good work.Favourite moment : The worst graphics option is named ""Utter♥♥♥♥♥♥"" Best one is named ""The♥♥♥♥♥♥"""
,Recommended,577080,29290839,Posted: 15 January,all,VidEvage,"I'll make this simple.To start, I crapped myself so much that my white rump turned black.I found out that my poo actually flung at a velocity that could ruin water towers.I discovered I could shoot down barrels and make a stain so potent I doubt even Mr.Shine could wipe it all off.But the best part about this game that I found? There is, quite literally, a crazed butt stabber who chases you... or at least in the portion I played.Honestly though this game is something you'll want to play with your friends watching because by yourself it might just be incredibly awkward.If you want to have a look at the game you can always watch me take a crack at it to give you a rough idea.
