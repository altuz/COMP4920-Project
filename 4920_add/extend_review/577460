Played it for 14 mins and got all of them once I closed it. While the game itself doesn't look bad for the time I've spent in it, I don't think this is the right approach - to add hundreds of pointless achievements just so achievement hunters (like myself) buy the game.Can't wait to see the new system that will replace Greenlight (which is so faulty right now, but that's a long story) if that ever happens."

,Not Recommended,577460,30342417,Posted: 5 March,all,niX,"This game is terrible. I saw a few friends playing it and thought for a dollar it would be worth a go.But no.Although I was intrugued by the nearly 700 achievements, I didn't buy it with the knowledge that you can simply idle this game for the achievements like 90% of the other people out there. I legitimately thought that the achievements were by making progress. They'd throw you an achievement for small little actions or for making progress or something. Even though the achievements don't make a lot of sense, I thought that was the dev's plan to motivate people to play their game.So I played 90 minutes of this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I thought I'd give it a chance... what a waste. The writing is cringeworthy. The battles are no challenge at all. I've been to three different towns and have not once seen a place to buy new equipment. No map. They hand out items and money like candy, taking all difficulty out. The story is poorly implemented. Poorly designed in general. Steam overlay doesn't work, and even trying to tab out using alt+tab doesn't seem to work. Sometimes, it'll also crash on start up. They've tried to mimic the dozens of other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cheap RPGMaker games here on Steam, but they fail even at that.Then I realized, ""Wow. Huh. I've played this for 90 minutes and gotten 6 achievements. Friends of mine played this for 20 minutes and have all 600. What gives?"" Try to find answers in the discussions section of Steam, and even the dev doesn't seem to understand what's going on or give a clear answer as to why the hell this game is so busted. The way it's SUPPOSED to work is that it will give you 1 achievement per second of playing. But it seems to work at random for some people, and not for others. HOW DO YOU ♥♥♥♥ UP THIS BAD?Lose lose situation. I wasted a dollar, I wasted 90 minutes of my life, and I had to idle the game for about 5 hours until the achievements unlocked. At least they unlockd, but still. About the only plus side of this was that it has card drops, and by selling my three drops I was able to get most of what I paid for this game back."

,Not Recommended,577460,30500719,Posted: 13 March,all,Xepherian,"This game was the tenth game I've reviewed for my ""Steam Redlight"" series, where I review games when they're 'in the red' in reviews to see if it's as garbage as everyone says it is.You can see the review / reaction videohere.In summary, I wouldn't buy this game unless you have an undying love for RPG Maker byproducts. The game is not absolutely terrible, but there are far better RPGs to spend your time on.Hunter's Grimm is an old-school RPG, which in my shallow game history is closest to be compared to Final Fantasy 4 in both its good aspects, and bad. You're inevitably going to fightEmperor Behemoth, just because you're wanting to teach him a lesson on how to name himself, becauseEmperor Behemothis surely not to be taken seriously.Realistically,Emperor Behemothkicked a lot of♥♥♥♥♥back in the day, but when he eventually got beaten, the four Hokage separated his armor in the four corners of their evidently flat world. I'm assuming, somehow, the armor got reunited, and these poor teenagers you'll be dropping in the story as, will have to try and de-throne the Emperor. It's worth nothing that the Sarai and Nicholas' parents both went to the store a year ago for milk and haven't been seen since. Unfortunate.A fun fact, also, is that this game was released back in October of 2013 by a different developer. The publisher and developer acknowledged on the community board that this is an updated re-release featuring new art and some other stuff. You can still find the older version of this game, albeit much more expensive, on some corners of the Internet.Enough of the formal introductions, let's see the good, the bad, and the score.The Good:Graphics: For coming straight out of RPG Maker, almost four years ago this year, the updated character and monster arts are pretty decent. This is including the sprites. However, the title screen is horrendous.Sound: In my Steam Redlight time, I always find games that have either an unfitting sound-track, no sound-track at all, or something that could only be related to drinking bleach, but with your ears. This game is unique in the way that I didn't want to take a sander to my ears after a reasonable period of time.The Bad:Gameplay: If you've played one RPG Maker game, you've played quite a few of them. This game doesn't introduce any cool mechanics or core competencies, and thus the gameplay is bland and uneventful. Not only this, but the game doesn't share certain information. For example. there's a part in the game where to continue, your character has to jump over a river. There's no indication that you know your character can do this, and they haven't done this in the past. You likely wouldn't find this out until you decided to walk around and press the action button on every square pixel in every cardinal direction, leaving a frustrating experience for players.Also, I paid little to no attention to the battles. I have a tendency to grind through each mob that I can see just so I don't risk falling behind, and because of that, all mobs I encountered I eventually found myself browsing my phone while tapping the action button repeatedly. Perhaps my own fault, but there was simply no need for any additional mechanics or attention.Story: RPGs are generally lore-rich adventures, but I found this game's universe to be pretty bland. The characters were intolerable due to upholding their tropes and the story-writer's love to play a joke out until it's dead. I couldn't be arsed to play the game past my initial 3.5 hour time limit I gave myself to decide if I wanted to play it, and because it couldn't keep my interest, I stopped.General: I don't particularly care for achievements, but I was able to get all 695 by leaving my game on for an extra hour after I decided to stop playing. I did it as a test to see if it actually happened, and it did. So if you decide you want to pay $2.00 for 695 achievements, here you go.The Score:For those who are unfamiliar with my channel, my scoring is a little less-than-traditional, but still relatively simple. I rate five categories from 0 to 2; 2 is great, 0 is terrible. The four categories are as below reviews, with the last being a ""Wildcard"" category. This category allows me to grade games based on criteria that some games have that others won't. For example, I wouldn't try and grade this game off how unique and innovative it is.Score: 3/10Graphics: 1/2The character and monster arts along with the sprites are all well done. Unfortunately the environment, shading, and title screen are bland, subpar, and/or just straight up ugly.Sound: 2/2:All music and sound effects I encountered seemed appropriately placed and not insanely obnoxious. Although, any time in one specific level may drive you insane, but that reigns true for most games.Gameplay: 0/2I was able to do some light reading on the Internet while handling these mob fights. It was great, yet I felt only have productive.Enjoyment: 0/2The enjoyment is rated at the lowest because I found myself questioning how long has it been and when I got into the three hour mark I was relieved. I was able to decide without hesitation that I didn't want to continue in this game.Storytelling: 0/2Wildcard Category- The story is there, but it wasn't engaging to me. This could have been overcome by having an interesting cast or crew, but I didn't want to learn anymore aboutEmperor Behemoth, or about how much Sarai enjoys chocolate milkshakes. I do think it's cool to have a ghost butler, though, but he wants to leave that realm as much as I did.If you like pina coladas and getting caught watching strange YouTube videos, you can start your journey here to the sweet succulent sounds of my voice:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGlNvKELYC4"

Hands off!"
,Not Recommended,577460,30659708,Posted: 21 March,all,"Axel ""Not the Real"" Foley","Hunter's Grimm is a typical RPG Maker game that claims inspiration from a slew of JRPGs that tug at your heartstrings and make you wish for the days where you stayed up late playing Dragon Warrior or Chrono Trigger.The problem is, it is nothing like any of the games it wants to take inspiration from, the sole thing they have in common is the fact that they're old school RPGs. Hunter's Grimm has a lot of problems, but I'll begin by listing the few positives it does have.Unlike a lot of RPG Maker games, the assets feel like they have a different touch to them. Unless it's the actual game interface, it feels like some work was put into either having someone else create the assets, or the dev found non-default assets to make their game. The base story of the game is not a bad story, I enjoyed the ""detective work"" in some quests.The issues with this game lie with it's dialogue, interface, and a few ""oopsies"" that were never ironed out. Your quest begins and it feels fairly obvious where to go. You are not introduced to a world map until you are struggling to find your second quest, which your quest log explains is ""north of your manor"". Since there was no world map before, I figured I would just try to go north outside of the manor, as the quest said. It didn't work, you have to go south, completely out of the manor's map to get onto the world map. On the world map, towns are not marked as FF-esque town sprites, instead you have half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sparkles showing you where to go. The sparkles in lieu of sprites are embarrassing in any RPG Maker game, because I know how easy it is to make a world map on there, no clue why the developer didn't take a couple seconds to make the world map aesthetically pleasing.After the second quest line, you are told to go to another town, Omber or something (everything in this game gets forgettable after the first fifteen minutes) - on the way to this town, you are introduced to a mountain maze. The level design is completely shoddy and angered me so much that after I got to Omber, I had to put the game down. It's not that it was hard, it was tediously long, and on the way there was nothing to look at. There was a patch of the maze that was literally nothing but grass, and this part can go on for up to 15-20 minutes if you have trouble navigating the maze. It was poorly developed and probably will reduce you to a ragequitting mess.Oh yeah, there are enemy battles. They are initiated a-la Earthbound style, except the enemies are much slower on here and you can easily ignore them. I fought three enemies in the entire time I played - two quest battles, and the first monster I encountered. The battles are dull, and the sprites don't mash up with what you actually fight, so the ghost you have to fight in a quest turns out to be a headless masquerade villain?? It's just typical, default RPG Maker combat with nothing added in to spice you up.Overall, an okay story and cohesive graphical design (except the fact that your main heroine's portrait looks absolutely nothing like her sprite) doesn't save this game from being a mess in what matters, the gameplay. The towns become forgettable as you begin to realize everything looks and feels the same. As the towns feel the same and battles get boring, you realize you're not playing a Square classic, or even a good RPG Maker indie like labyronia - instead, it feels like you're playing your younger sibling's RPG Maker creation and it loses it's appeal quickly. Sadly, Hunter's Grimm is a predictable, ""Grimm"" experience."

,Not Recommended,577460,33940235,Posted: 31 July,all,ToiletROCK,"I got a 90% discount coupon from crafting and decided to give the game a go since it was basically free, in a sense. Hunter's Grimm is an old-school RPG where two heroes you control embark on a journey to kill the Emperor Behemoth, the final boss apparently. There aren't many good points about this game other than its decently-drawn sprites. However, there is an overwhelming number of bad points in this game which resulted in me not recommending the game.1. The title screen is absolutely atrocious. Most of the UI options and button selection is handled by F-keys on your keyboard. Other than the girl artwork, everything else about the title screen simply screams ""no effort"".2. The story is bland, dull and uninteresting. It is rather predictable, but at least the characters follow a plot, which I guess isn't too bad. The story won't keep you playing though, for obvious reasons.3. There is a lack of proper tutorial. Although some may enjoy the joy of discovering every element of the game by trial and error, I can guarantee there is absolutely no joy in doing so. While most controls and mechanics are easy to grasp, there will be certain parts of the story where the lack of direction can be annoyingly frustrating since to progress through the plot, you can required to perform certain actions at a certain place. But since the game doesn't tell you that, you wouldn't know unless you button-mashed your ""Interact"" key everywhere and happen to chance upon that. Moreover, the currency on screen is indicated as ""G"", which one may assume is gold. For some odd reason, when you pick up money from the ground, it is called ""Silver Keys"". Very confusing indeed.4. Battles are rather lame. I got through most of the battles by button-mashing ""Action"" or ""Attack"". There does not seem to be any strategy involved nor do you need to plan your moves for each encounter.5. The achievements are senseless and pointless. They do not relate to the game at all. You get one achievement every one second you are playing the game; nothing related to completing tasks, reaching goals or progressing through the game. Nothing. If you just want free 695 achievements to increase your achievement count on your profile or be able to use emojis as your achievements, you can pick this game up and just leave it running for ~12 minutes to get all of them.Overall, I would not recommend getting this game at all. The game is not completely unplayable or downright horrible, but there is a lot of room for improvement and much to be desired. I did not finish the game; my patience ran dry at a certain point and just stopped playing. Honestly, the money you spend on this game just isn't worth it, imo. The only reason why one would even willingly purchase the game is to farm the easy achievements and trading cards."

It's one of those games where it's not bad, but also not good.I got through my first battle in the game, i was kinda dissapointed actually. The thing that bothered me was the battle sprites for the main characters. the battle sprites are overworld sprites for the main characters. enemies get like a huge, detailed battle sprite and you look tiny compared to your enemy! Battles are as generic as a good ol' fashioned RPG game. kinda dissapoints me with nothing different than other RPG games.World design is good, even adds in a little game for you to check every barrel and object to collect pieces (which is cool in my opinion because you get a reward).Characters are good but i think they went overboard with the personality. I know good character design is needed in a game but this game likes to make it feel like a anime show. Maybe excessive dialogue pains me.I haven't noticed any grammar errors that make this game hard to play, and if there is any errors than it probably flew over my head.Story is so far good surprisingly. I came to get this game for emojis and now i'm here hooked on the game. Speaking of emojis, the achievements icons are stolen from the facebook emojis, so thats a added plus. whats even better is that if you manage to get all the cards by lucky good drops and paying for the rest of the cards when someone is curtious enough to lower the price (seriously, a dollar for a card?). You'll get a emoji, but it's actually a emoticon. pretty cool right.I'd also like to note that the story seems kinda predictablewell, theres your review from someone thats only played 0.4 hours of the game. i still haven't gotten a achievement (maybe one day) the price is ok, but even better with a coupon. buy this for the emojis or good story."

(AFK)","Now this game is rather confusing....Because this is RPG maker and RPG maker shovelware is straight forward on steam.Let me tell you a fact about the steam store. If you look into RPG's under 5 dollars (Not including winter/summer sales / events etc) normal price you might see an oversaturation of RPG maker shovelware titles. Most come with about 5 to 10 achievements, some arent typical RPG titles as some use a less combat-centric playstyle and use a more story heavy or episodic series style for multiple follow-ups of the same *quality* but none the less its pretty straight forward.This was an idle RPG maker title. 600+ steam achievements for being afk and leaving the game open. I dont remember even walking, or any memory of even playing this....Not only is this an issue with me, because it is a RPG twenty some years of gaming has taught me the story kinda matters. The gameplay matters. Even if it is a♥♥♥♥♥♥ant old school EXP per kill turn based playstyle at least it gives me the incentive to play the actual game.This one was confusing. I got it for badges, achievments and nothing else. Filler for the fudgers.((EDIT)) I had to write this in at the last second, the final achievement in the game that you idle unlock is the confederate flag of the south.....I find that oddly interesting."

,Recommended,577460,33736301,Posted: 22 July,all,Jones,Achiements are senseless. The effort is present and tangible but it does not live up to the end user's expectations. And don't let the game cover fool you or anyone.edit: After 2 hours it gets to be playable and its fine.
