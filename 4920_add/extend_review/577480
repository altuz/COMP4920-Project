,Recommended,577480,31713125,Posted: 12 May,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"The first part of the answer arc of the series, and honestly, it’s amazing and addicting. After you start to read Meakashi, you won’t stop until you’ve read everything. Each chapter makes you so curious that at least to me it was impossible to wait a while before reading the rest.This “Eye Opening” chapter is directly related to Watanagashi, showing us another perspective of what happened on the second game and its answers (at least most of them). Ryukishi07 (creator/writer) did an excellent job here. So far, Meakashi is one of the best Higurashi chapters I’ve read so far, not only because it helps to answer several questions, but because it’s so well written and connects so perfectly to Watanagashi that once you reach the end you’ll feel that youneedmore of this series, but you have to wait for the next translations. Damn.∞/10.Also there’s a mention of the best girl during Rika’s death. ♥"
,Recommended,577480,31432477,Posted: 28 April,all,Luftwafl,"By far my favorite arc of the entire series, Meakashi is probably the spoopiest and most mind blowing Higurashi gets (based on the anime and manga, that is). As the first answer arc, you begin to see similar events to past chapters but from a different perspective, with huge differences in understanding because of it. This factor makes Meakashi incredibly satisfying on account of the new information and plot twists, while Ryukishi does an excellent job of posing questions that even the characters who drive the story can't properly answer. I obviously wouldn't recommend it unless you've experienced chapters 1-4, but picking it up should be a priority for fellow moe/comedy/horror/mystery fans."

,Recommended,577480,31455334,Posted: 29 April,all,Yureina,"The first of the ""Answer Arcs"" of Higurashi has finally arrived... and it does not disappoint.Meakashi tells roughly the same story as the second chapter of Higurashi, Watanagashi, but from the perspective of Shion Sonozaki. Through this change of perspective, you find out what really was going on during that earlier storyline and why. And that story, the story that Meakashi tells, is probably the best one in Higurashi. It also is one of the most depressing tragedies I have ever come across.Keeping this review free of spoilers means I can't get into things in any real detail, but Meakashi affected me quite alot when I first came across it. While earlier storylines in Higurashi have a similar pattern of watching a pleasant world crumble, before you didn't really have a clear sense of what was going on. Here, you know exactly why things go wrong, and it is easy to understand the motivations behind it all. The villain's actions are horrific, but you are able to see the road that led them there and how something that started so sweet turned into an inescapable nightmare fueled by madness, paranoia, and grief.While some other arcs like Tsumihoroboshi or Tatarigoroshi come close, Meakashi ultimately is my favorite of the eight main Higurashi storylines. It can be incredibly disturbing and hard to stomach, but to me that is just proof of how well-written it really is. Obviously, you should play the first four before getting to this one, but it is all very much worth it. As far as I am concerned, this is among the best that VN's and storytelling have to offer.Hope things go better... in another world."

It does a really good job answering a lot of questions (it is the first Answer arc after all) but does an even better job creation new questions that will hopefully be answered in the next arcs. It really does a good job at giving another perspective of events of past games and helping understand what happened, all coupled with great story and great character development. Definitely recommend it if you have played 1-4 and if not, do yourself a favor and go buy them and play them!"

76561198087647750,Recommended,577480,31592882,Posted: 6 May,all,lindbergkaige,"As a first time reader of the series, the first answer arc blew my expectations out of the water. The first half takes place a year before the Chapters 1-3, and while it answers a lot of questions regarding Satoshi & Shion, I didn't find it that interesting. The second half in comparison, takes place during the same timeline as Chapter 2, and absolutely blew me away. If, like me, it's been a year or more since you've read Chapter 2, I recommend pulling up a Let's Play of Chapter 2 when you get to the 2nd half of this story. Any time both Keeichi & Shion are in a scene together in chapter 5, watch the scene first in the chapter 2 Let's Play, and have your mind blown."

,Recommended,577480,32001845,Posted: 27 May,all,Reimu☆rena~,"This is the first answer arc in the series; focusing on the events that take place in the Watanagashi-hen arc.Graphics: 8/10Apart from a few new locations and Keiichi finally getting a character portrait, the graphics had remained the same and consistent.Storyline: 9/10This arc is told in the shoes of Shion Sonozaki (Mion’s twin sister) as she escapes from her private school and returns to Hinamizawa; she is assisted by Kasai Tatsuyoshi in her escape. She then later meets Satoshi Hōjō when she surrounded by thugs. We later find out that Shion would often switch identities and would often refer to herself as Mion, one of the only way of distinguishing them apart is the demon tattooed on her back. The rest story is revolved heavily around Shion’s love for Satoshi Hōjō and his disappearance, as Shion figures out how the ‘curse system’ works.Sound: 8/10It seems that there is a bit more variety of soundtracks in this arc compared to the previous 4 that were released which is a good thing as they were kinda “off” in the 3rd arc. It’s only a minor improvement, but it sure does make the gameplay more engaging.Gameplay: 7/10The first thing I noticed was the menu UI, it looks much cleaner than the other novels, but it remains as functional. Although the game didn’t crash, there were still minor spelling and grammar mistakes here and there (hopefully the devs will consider this and make an update).Price: 10/10For only £5.59, this is a great investment. If you’ve read the other 4 novels, this is highly recommended as it will clear up the (most of the) questions that you’ve might have been asking yourself."

76561198197896761,Recommended,577480,31619613,Posted: 7 May,all,trueangelcool,"Higurashi When They Cry Meakashi is the fifth chapter in the Higurashi series.This chapter was really good. Shion is the star for Meakshi.I just loved everything about Meakashi. The new music was awesome. It took some time getting used to as I was used to the ones for four chapters. Once I got used to the music I really enjoyed the music a lot. One thing I also noticed right away was the quality of the music was much much much better than the previous four chapters, For some reason the other four chapter's music quality is low. Also there are two tracks in particular that I enjoyed a lot. I don't know what the tracks are called. One track I guess best to describe (In my opinion) is suspense/intense. I don't think this track played a lot. Maybr three or four times. I wish I heard the track more as it was really good. The other track which os my favorite that I relly like is the sad one. Now this track plays a lot more. This track played a lot more towards the end of the game.OMG seeing a sprite for Satoshi was awesome. But man it felt super weird to finally see a Keichii sprite. I was like yes it's great to finally see Keichii's sprite in the game. I really love Satashi's and and Keichii's new sprite a lot:) I swear Keichii looks like he works out a lot LOL.The story without spoiling a lot was amazing. This chapter is an answer arc and answers question's for the second chapter Watanagashi. I found out there is a reason why the answer arc's are not in order. So it makes sense that Onikakushi is not first.But there are still some questions raised and left unanswered. I'm pretty sure those left unanswered and new questions will get answered. I just don't know when that will happen.Definetly get chapter five Meakashi and play:) It was a very good chapter and I cannot wait to get the next chapter. To bad as always it's probably going to take a while to come to Steam:("

Tingling at the fingertips.PS3 patch (yeah, game is strongly recommended to be played with PS3 patch) failed me at the end of the last day. Well, Meakashi is short-released, so it can`t be helped.

,Recommended,577480,31668516,Posted: 10 May,all,『 ｖｉｒｔｆ！~ 』,"An incredible, beautiful, heart-wrenching depiction of a tragedy, while still keeping true to the series trend of answering questions but asking more. As a first-time reader of the series, I would've almost been happy with as an ending to the series simply out of how emotional and even touching it was; if all the hours put into the first four chapters of the series had to pay for something, I'm so, so glad it was for this. It's my favorite visual novel to date and might be the thing I regret never having a chance to experience for the first time again the most.I really can't put into words how much I enjoyed Meakashi. It blew my prior favorite visual novel, fate/stay night, well and truly out of the water. I'm both very, very much looking forward to the future instalments and very, very much not emotionally prepared for them.Thank you for sharing this story, Ryukishi07. An absolute steal for 8 dollars."

Within the first few minutes of the game the protagonist Shion says that she dislikes the Bible, God and the catholic school she attends. I wouldn't be too surprised if the creator of the game Ryukishi07 was expressing his own dislike for christianity through the protagonist.To any christians and especially catholics reading this: STAY LIGHTYEARS AWAY from this heretical garbage! It's trash. It's not worth your money. A real christian doesn't read this visual nothingness."

I was right about some things; I was very wrong about others, including motives. The whole ""I laughed and cried"" cliche? Oh God, yes. Some bits were funny and gleeful, but the ending wrecked me. I also shuddered with tension and revulsion. Amazing writing and music.My brain is teeming with theories. Desperate for the next release. Please hurry up, Manga Gamer!A note: This was the first in the series for which I used the PS2 art and voice mod--otherwise I've read on Steam with Steam graphics or the iPad version with the original art--and I wish I'd started sooner. The voice acting, for the twins in particular, is stellar. And oh, to get rid of those awful filtered backgrounds. Well worth the mod."

,Recommended,577480,31496213,Posted: 1 May,all,Enter_77,"This review: contains no spoilersProsCharacter perspective--- A refreshingly unique perspective from one of the other major characters that has appeared in previous chapters.Resolution to mysteries--- Aside from a couple cheap tricks, this chapter offers satisfying answers for Ch. 2's mysteries. They fit naturally, make sense, and could have been deduced ahead of time by studying Ch. 2 carefully. This chapter also delivers the missing piece to the puzzle – the motivation – which also covers an important, often mentioned period of time that took place before the main series.ConsSoundtrack--- Lower quality sound and music returning from previous chapters; muffled and lacking the same impact. Some tracks were also hard to listen to and featured very high pitched screeching.ConclusionCh. 5 serves as the companion piece to Ch. 2, retelling its major events from a different character's perspective while simultaneously resolving its mysteries. Not as shocking now by knowing how it will all eventually conclude, the journey is made just as fun by finally being able see everything fall into place in a way that stays true to Higurashi's themes.Novel length is roughly10 hoursdepending on reading speed. It's recommened tobuy Higurashi Ch. 5only after reading at least Ch. 1 and Ch. 2 while also being able to recollect what happened in the latter."

Although this game is amazing, there was one plot point that confused me. Massive spoilers for the ending:Why did Shion (The REAL Shion inside the well with a stun gun to her head) not reveal the information that Granny had nothing to do with the murders until the ending? She could have told Mion (The REAL Mion. Or ""Shion"" in Chapter 2) when she was being tortured. Maybe Mion never asked the actual question, maybe I misread something earlier, maybe the anime will explain this, or maybe a future game will explain this."
76561198041993574,Recommended,577480,33961533,Posted: 1 August,all,MrMarki134,"As all the other chapters, this is an amazing artpiece. It's got thrilling parts, cruel parts, sad parts, beautiful parts, and an ending that is breathtaking and capable of pull out some tears from your eyes. Comparing it to the anime, it doesn't give that much importance to the gore and focuses on the psychologic scenario of Shion, allowing you to understand better why everything happens, and I've mentioned earlier the ending, that differs from the ending of the arc in the anime, not in what happens, but in how the protagonist sees everything (In fact, that can be applied to the whole game) making an incredible moment in all the series.The problem with the OST that I mentioned in other analysis (in arcs 2-4 the OST is really terrible) is solved. The new songs match perfectly the sad, intense, and grotesque moments.Only thing left to say is that this is another wonderful and marvelous game that you must play if you loved the last ones.One little SPOILER:Keiichi's updated sprite is a little bit lame. He should be able to put down his fist in tense situations, and he has a kinda goofy face that doesn't suit him at all."
