,Recommended,577660,29620013,Posted: 31 January,all,classixuk,"OK, so this demo is short. Very short. But it promises so much and is definitely worth the download, if only to show support to the developers for the full experience to be worked upon and released.As somebody who has been to sea as a crewman and a lifeboat trained leader on many passenger liners throughout the years, I have sailed the dreaded route taken across the Atlantic by the Titanic many times. I have clung desperately onto the rails of many a focsle deck whilst the waves raised some 30-40ft above my head. Sometimes I wondered if the bow would ever come back up, and we're talking ships twice the size of the Titanic here! It's a ridiculously scary experience, especially knowing that you will be responsible for the lives of every passenger and crew member in your lifeboat if the worst should happen.But what's even more harrowing about the Titanic tale, is that the Atlantic that night was even calmer than the Pacific (""Pacify""). Titanic sailed to her doom upon a bed of glass like water with merely a ripple of distress. She contained enough lifeboats and rafts for every soul on board until the 'visual designers' deemed them unsightly before she sailed.""Why do we need these unsightly lifeboats? After all, she's unsinkable, isn't she?"", they queried.In this demo we get to hear the voice (unsure if it's acted, or the actual voice) of a survivor's words. We get to hear and see the majesty of the Titanic sailing by a small fishing boat, and we also preview the hulk of a majestic liner doomed to a life beneath the waves instead of upon them.This could be an incredible experience: a lesson of reflection for us all, and a moment to ponder, as we witness the fate of 'yesteryear's technological breakthrough"" via the lenses of today's breakthrough tech.Very exciting!"

,Recommended,577660,29864104,Posted: 11 February,all,Tonybyte,"A short demo only meant to be a small taste of hopefully big things to come! I'm fascinated by the Titantic and this demo has made me excited to see where else they will put us in this experience. I hope we step inside and I hope we get an onboard experience of it cracking in half. Who knows. What I do know is that based on this, I believe I will enjoy it. I've been wanting a Titantic experience since... the early 2,000s (?) when I had some 1st person PC game where you walked around the ship.The demo is short, around 6 minutes, but brilliant IMO. No stutters here. The graphics look great to me. Sure, none of the VR games currently look like my monitor with Titan X but for me, these graphics are fine and I'm grateful to the devs for putting me on Apollo 11 and now this! This has great sound design and cinematics like a movie trailer. I'm glad I tried it.Someone said the scale is off when you are underwater looking at the ship. Hmmm maybe? I wouldn't have thought this if he hadn't mentioned it. Should it look larger at this point of view? IDK. I feel like I could have stepped onto it and it would have been correct. Thoughts?"

Every 0.5 seconds the Vive waiting screen with ""waiting for Titanic VR"" flares up, so the experience is a permanent flickering. I have 50+ VR games and experiences and this is the only one that does so.i7-6700K, 32 GB, GTX 970, SSD"

,Not Recommended,577660,30013373,Posted: 18 February,all,butch_1986,Really looked forward to playing this but having issues with the vive waiting screen..... Never had any problems with VR gaming so this is the first for me! Any suggestions for a fix (if there is one) would be greatly appreciated.
76561197990081896,Not Recommended,577660,29855408,Posted: 11 February,all,ninjeratu,"Horrible underwater performance.Might be an informative title about Titanic but you will never know - you'd probably get an epileptic fit before you learn anything.This is also another of those VR titles with sense of scale issues (or, rather, lack of) due to neurotic IPD settings, strange AA and poor modelling/light, albeit this is a rather subjective issue, (I find this is the same issue you get in Universe Sandbox where objects like Betelgeuse - a super large sun in Orion - looks like a cute pool ball...)So for me it's like ""yeah, come look at this tiny little toy ship in 2 frames per second"".No, thanks.(Footnote: Kaspersky does NOT like this title and will interfere with the process makinte it almost impossible to run it at all. FIshy, since it's the ONLY title I have that has issues with antivirus software)."

I'm quite interested in what further they do with this.Subsequent comment.When I first ran this on my old CyberPC unit, it ran fine;  but when I downloaded it to my new Asus Predator PC, I could not get it to run properly at all.  The only way I can describe it is a continuous overlying flicker between waiting for the game, and actually running it.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game game several times, but always the same flickering result.  When it ran right, I loved it; but the flickering makes it unplayable.I run an HTC Vive unit.  Anybody else experience the same issues?"

I am not a history buff, but it is an interesting story. I think the graphics lookpromising, and I really liked where we go underwater. If the full version is reaonably priced, I will probably be a buyer."

76561198070505447,Recommended,577660,29795653,Posted: 8 February,all,Barking,"Interesting concept, wish it was a bit longer.A good demonstaration of one of the many areas vr can revoloutinise, history.The three criticisms I have are:- Length, probably less than five minutes long- Inception horn /  blackouts, honestly I think this distracts from the inherent creepy, sad sight of the ship resting on the seafloor. Not required at best and are damaging to experience in all honesty.- Non touch control implimentation.  During the opening scene there was a pair of hands floating half a foot above my head. Don't see how the hands help the experience in all honesty, not sure why they need models in the first place.Other nitpicky thing would be to improve the models / textures there fine for the expeience, but again would be one of the areas that could be enhanced.Lovely tone and good presentation, looking forward to other such projects."

Even though it just took roughly 5 minutes to complete the experience as a whole was quite impressive. The graphics are great and I am really looking forward to the complete experience which is expected to be released by the end of 2017.I'll most likely be using this demo for future VR showcases, especially if I am going to show it to someone who's old. It's really useful in that way as it requires no interaction by the player. You can just sit back (or rather stand) and let everything play out before you."
76561198261847511,Recommended,577660,29638528,Posted: 1 February,all,agshaieb,"The demo is only a trailer. It is not playable and it is not interactable. The game has potential to be cool, but the Titanic should be built to scale. It appears way too small on the screen and by no means even believable."
