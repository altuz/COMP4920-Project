This one feels cleaner, smoother, and the 3D models are nice! Also they are planning on adding more content to this one plus you get the first two dlc bundled in when they come out at no additional charge.Also one last thing is the Dev team is WONDERFUL they listen to the community and act accordingly. Thank you guys for making a wonderful game!"
,Not Recommended,577690,30352669,Posted: 6 March,all,Princess Rachel,"I'm a huge fan of Spooky's. I loved the original and was blown away by how good the Karamari Hospital DLC is.But... this left me disappointed.I support the developer on Patreon, and so have received regular updates about this ""HD remake"", and this led me to have much higher hopes.It honestly just feels like a mod. A good mod, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't feel like it's changed enough to warrant repackaging & selling.It honestly feels like the same deal as Overwatch - paying for an incomplete, early-access game branded as complete.Spooky's is one of my all-time favourite horror games that still scares me even today, but the problem with this ""HD remake"" is that while it does add some new things, it also breaks other things and leaves them incomplete, and what it does well has the unfortunate side-effect of making those screwups all the more glaring.Only a few specimens have been updated with new models, but this doesn't exactly matter as the chases are still repetitive and give you next to no reason to ever turn around and look at what's chasing you, and they pretty much all kill you in the same way - a few scratches popping up on the screen to indicate damage. Just run, and you're fine. You could go a whole playthrough never looking at more than one or two specimens.A good way to solve this would be to make 3D models for EVERY specimen, then add some form of puzzles or even just key-hunting, to give an element of panic. Also, make all the specimens move faster. They don't have to all move as fast as Specimen 3, but they should all at least have varying speeds higher than that of the player's walking speed. It makes no sense that you can outwalk them; you could get a good feeling of pressure by forcing us to ration our stamina for sprinting away.The Amnesia puzzle? Figuring out hiding spots and getting the keys in Specimen 12? Those were great; do more of that! Especially in the school, where you clearly put in effort making larger rooms.Also, Specimen 10's 2nd form moves TOO fast. Slow him down just a little bit.The specimens in general need to have a reason for us to be afraid, not just because ""the sprite / model is sliding toward you and will scratch you to death"". We have to be in more of a panic to get away from them, but simply sprinting through room after room and never looking at them gets very old very fast.The rooms have been updated, and some - especially the new ones - look very nice. However, this also doesn't matter as there is still no point to looking at anything. You can just run through a room and click any door, and it won't make a difference. My suggestion to fix this would be to have more interactivity or puzzles, or to have every door in a room be slightly different to give you a rough idea of what to expect in the next room. For example, either a specimen chase or a puzzle to solve, or a completely random room like what every door currently does.Several elements of the game have also been either removed or broken entirely.For example: When in the Silent Hill area, there's a room with an unexplained sperm-like sprite. In the original game, this thing would thrash around with the demonic sound of a shrieking baby. It was VERY disturbing. But in this version of the game, the sprite just sits there not doing anything.Also when Specimen 12 is patrolling the rooms, you used to be able to tell via an audio cue when he had entered & left, so you knew when it was safe to leave. That's no longer the case. When you're hiding in the tunnels, he used to have a fairly audible whisper that was quite haunting. That's gone. When he chases you toward the end, he also used to have a terrifying wail before the chase began. That's also gone.In its current form, I cannot recommend this HD version of Spooky's.When it's seen some updates, if the problems have been fixed, I'll replay it and perhaps update my review to recommend it, but as it is, can't recommend.BUT - I do want the developer to be supported, so my advice to players would be to get the original free version on Steam, then buy the Karamari Hospital DLC. You won't be disappointed.Also, consider supporting the developer on his Patreon:https://www.patreon.com/AlbinoMoose"
,Recommended,577690,30340116,Posted: 5 March,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Spooky's Jump Scare Mansionis a really odd game that I think most people will find too abstract but an interesting conversation piece, nonetheless.When this was a free-to-play game, I told myself that if they ever charged for it, I'd give it a go. So here we are.Essentially, while this is described as a horror game, it is more of a casual story-driven deal.Yeah there are little scares here-and-there, but it's noFive Nights at Freddies. Doesn't matter. The best part of it is just experiencing it. If you think you are going to play it, just don't watch any LetsPlays or anything, and dive right in.Is it worth seven bucks? Ehhh, probably.Pros:+Unique experience that I find oddly addicting+Very 'lite' in the horror category which is welcome to me+Quite funCons:-The mechanic doesn't sound good, but for some reason works wellI'd get it on sale, unless you find yourself unusually interested."
,Recommended,577690,32098315,Posted: 31 May,all,Dokta Whawee,"I made a review of the original, and I said I liked it, but didn't get far, as I was too spooked. Oh, how you can grow in a year...This game is great. It is surprisingly scary, and very addictive, as it is completely random aside from the set encounters. So, what is this game? It is... well... you know those ""haunted houses"" that used to be held by your school, that weren't really scary? Well, this game is like one of those, but actually scary. Very scary to be in fact!So many people said that I would lose my crap over FNaF, but that game was just boring to me, dispite a few moments that creeped me out. No, this game is MUCH better!Each specimen is a representative from a horror genre. The 1st specimen is just a ""Kawaii"" jumpscare that you would see from a child's horror game. The 2nd is a slime monster that tries to trap you with slime, and reminds me of old 1940s/1950s monster films. The 3rd is a lethal spider which hunts you down from the celing to try to infect you with a venemous bite. The 4th is a ghost of a Japanese school girl, much like an old JP horror film.  The 5tb is a Pyramid head like monster that will warp your perception of reality. The 6th is an obvious reference to Majora's mask, even down to it having the same face as the Happy Mask Salesman, who teleports behind you if you aren't looking at it. The 7th is a wall that reminds me of Giygas from EarthBound, who doesn't reappear at all after you have encountered him.(More to come!)"

I'm super excited.So far, so good.][I will post a full review once my playthrough of the 1000 rooms is complete. It could take up to a week, as I want to scrutinise every little detail]UPDATE: On the verge of room 400. I would like to say well done with specimen 5(? puppet enemy) and specimen 3. 3 is very intimidating and is at the perfect speed to be almost inescapable. As an arachniphobe, it is very unsettling. However, I have 2 issues. In the update yesterday TOASTMASTER commented on the dark rooms. Sometimes they are too dark, to the level where you can't see anything. Also, the jumpscares are not as well done. This is probably because of the 3D sound. I recommend reverting the audio from the jumpscares back into 2D.UPDATE [AGAIN]: At room 750. Have started to experience a few bugs,most importantly:1. When specimen 10 spawns, his old self [larger worm] spawned with him2. When specimen 10 changes into his quick form, his doesn't change back when he attacks you OR when you ener a new room.3. The bug where you fell through the floor [recently patched]I'm liking the new Health+Stamina bar though, and also enjoyed humanoid spec 10's animation (while it lasted)."

I played the free version and wanted to support the creator. I purchased the soundtrack and the hospital dlc. When I saw this version, I snatched it up. I haven't played the game in a long while, but I still want to provide support.As per why I love this game, it's pretty simple. It's adorable.I love the art style, Spooky is perhaps the cutest ghost named Spooky that I have ever seen.I haven't played much of the HD version, but I have noticed something that bothered me in the original.In the original, I did a lot of strafing. I played a lot of Doom growing up and if I can strafe, you better believe that I will.In any case, I noticed, in the original, I would get caught on the walls or edges when I would strafe. This caused me to get hurt by the various specimens running about.Now that's not an issue. It's almost as though my character has a nice coating of Crisco, allowing them to glide freely along the walls to their heart's content as opposed to the velcro that was before.That was a long way to say, I love this game, and I am looking forward to be jumpscared by a slice of bread... again."

Although it looks pretty promising, your only form of movement is via keyboard/mouse or controller.  The super downside is that you turn and run VERY quickly and jerk around quite a bit.  You can't turn this down in the settings, despite there being sensitivity options (at least it didn't work for me).  On a controller, the sticks do not matter.  a small push left means one speed turning left. fast.  I think I got about 10 minutes in before I felt really sick, and that is unusual for me.  Even after taking the headset off and writing this review I am still dizzy.  These controls are very poorly implemented for VR purposes.  Please add actual turning controls for controllers, or sensitivity options, or nausea-reducing measures.  anything.  i would like to play it.Even the opening flash screens and text crawl is poorly implemented.  They take up your field of view in a rectangle that is locked to your view no matter where you turn. you can barely read the edges of the text crawl because it takes up slightly more than your useful field of view.  Plus you are involuntarily moving during it, which is disorienting."
,Recommended,577690,31788809,Posted: 16 May,all,ancientpower,"While the low budget indie aesthetic may be off-putting, Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion is a shockingly well executed horror game peppered with cute palate cleansing moments.I would credit the minimalistic approach as one of the game's greatest strengths. The mechanics are simple and concise, leading to a very satisfying horror experience. Simple (and fair) gameplay means that despite proceudral generation, success is completely up to the player's skills and wits rather than random chance.Akuma Kira's ambient soundtrack is wonderful, every track carries a sense of dread that made my heart sink while the gameplay had it pounding in my chest. The sound design is excellent in general, and the music was never disruptive or grating.Unfortunately, the game is plagued by an inconsistent tone and on-the-nose horror references that can shatter any sense of immersion.  While trying not to spoil anything, I also found the story rather disappointing and wish that the delivery had been less direct. More breadcrumbs and more room for speculation could have provided a good amount of replayability and discussion points after beating the game.Be wary if you aren't a fan of campy horror. But if you're a fan of RPG Maker games like Witch's House and Yume Nikki, or enjoy reading the SCP Foundation wiki then it's much easier to look past the game's flaws and just enjoy it for what it is: a love letter to horror stories of the internet age.NOTE: I haven't played the original Game Maker version. I felt that this game was worth the $7 I spent for the 5-6 hours I got in gameplay, especially considering there are two unreleased gamemodes. It seems that there's no notable content exclusive to the HD edition, and new content is not advertised. Just something to keep in mind if you've already played the original.CORRECTION: The upcoming Build Your Own Mansion mode and Steam Workshop compatibility will be exclusive to the HD version."

However, the updated HD version is new in a lot of ways, yet familiar in all the right ways that count. Even if you've played the original to hell and back, it's worth picking up the update.Later this year, they'll even add Workshop support, so you can design your own mansion!

Everything is repetitive as hell - For each new type of environment/monster the pattern is really the same - get notes, read, run from monster. Almost no variance among monsters/ghosts. They look differently but at the end of the day - you just run as much as you can just to reach next room before they can touch you. After reaching the end of the game - disappointment. No fun ending, nothing really worth the struggle of going through 800 the same rooms.Definitely + for spooky character. Really lovely and I felt sad that it appeared only few times in the game.

Things you can interact with in the rooms are fairly obvious, and I never felt like I was lost or stuck. There always seems to be a way forward just nearby, and the game just flows in a satisfying way without becoming monotonous.The checkpoint system is such that you will sometimes, though not excessively, have to play through a large area repeatedly. The specimens (enemies) can sometimes be tricky to avoid, and I got frustrated a few times when I thought I was doing it right. There are hints scattered around the rooms on how to handle each one.The music is excellent but not intrusive. Music transitions from room to room, and is not merely atmospheric. There are intermittent ambient noises. Each specimen has a musical theme, and one in particular utters threatening taunts. Jumpscares are accompanied by scary, bizarre or funny sounds.I played with a controller. There are annoyances when trying to select menu items. I had to tap the stick back and forth to highlight something. Moving, turning, and strafing in first-person is very fluid, and you will be doing a lot of all three.The game actually is scary, though somehow also relaxing and hypnotic. There are nods to games like Silent Hill, Amnesia, Alien, and probably others I didn't catch.Just as I began to think I'd seen all the game had to offer, it offered a surprise or joke that piqued my interest again. I thought the ending was okay. It's not exactly memorable, but the journey was worth it.Is it worth $10 when you can play a free version? I think so. This is not a ""let's watch a let's play"" kind of game. You should experience it for yourself. More free content is promised, and I'd like to support any future games."

It's free to Download on Steam too! In my personal Opinion,it definitely is Worth every Cent.I mean,for 10$,you get an amazing Singleplayer Horror Experience,Steam Cards,upcoming Achievements,upcoming DLCs and Endings AND upcoming Custom Levels!PROS AND CONS IN TOTAL:-It gets very Repetitive sometimes with the Rooms,since the Game is randomly Generated.-There are still some Glitches,but the Developers are trying their Best to fix them all,so,that's a +!-There is no real Backstory and/or Objective,except for ""Make it to Room 1000 and don't Die."".-The Lack of Replayability of the Campaign Mode.

I don't mind the simple graphics one bit, but the randomized path just seems really gimmicky to me. It never really matters which door you go through, and there really aren't that many different types of rooms. The best and most varied parts are when you get introduced to new specimens but these sections tend to be over quick and you're back to the chore of opening the next 50 doors to get to the next checkpoint. I think in concept there's a lot of potential here, the execution just didn't do much for me.♥♥♥♥ it, I'm recommending it because I still like it for some reason."

The devs also seems very motivated and they have fixed a number of bugs in the few days Spooky was out.Unfortunatly I cannot recommend this game. You are in a randomized maze of a thousands rooms and you must get to the end, all while sometime being chased by monsters. Some rooms are fixed, such as the checkpoints or the place where you encounter new creatures. Those rooms where you encounter new creatures are pretty well done and deliciously creepy.However, the game randomizations work against it and it end up being a 1000-door rush toward the exit. There's absolutly no reason not to run toward the room's exit as soon as you enter, even without a monster behind you. As for the creatures themselves most are just humanoid entity running toward you and hurting you when close enought. There is some escalations in the power of the monster which make you fear what the next part of the maze hold. But after the puppet, you realize that no monsters even come close to being as dangerous and that the new gimmicks are just filters over the screen or are just massively slowing you down. For exemple, there's some creature which you have to stay close to, or else it go insane and start to go extremly fast. It could be interessing if this monster was moving erratically and you had to pay attention to its movement, or if he was paired with another monster, but since it keep moving at the same slugish speed, this just make the whole thing tedious instead of scary.The story was nothing amazing either.Maybe the hospital and future update will change my opinion about this game but I doubt it."

First of all, anyone that is a fan of the original Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion already knows that the game plays exactly the same.Specimen Changes:Specimen 1: When the player chops one of the cardboard cutouts, it gently falls to the ground.Specimen 2: Specimen 2 now emerges from the pool of goop instead of spawning from the opposite door. In addition, Specimen 2 also seems to go faster, and the pool of goop slows the player down considerably.Specimen 3: Specimen 3 has a graphical update and is now extremely fast. When it attacks the player it recedes a few feet back before resuming the chase. In addition, it can spawn from any hole in the ceiling. Immune to the axe.Specimen 4: Specimen 4's scripted room has been extended to include more lockers. more (locked) rooms and is now two stories. Specimen 4 is notably transparent with black lines and has a noticeable shadow around her figure.Specimen 5: Specimen 5 plays pretty much the same, although it moves slightly faster and it actually busts down the doors instead of opening it. The fog effect has been removed.Specimen 6: Specimen 6 plays pretty much the same, although it seeingly spawns faster if the player isn't looking backwards. In addition, if Specimen 6 spawns in the room and stays there for a short period of time the strings attached to it will launch it up in the air and randomly land on the player. Immune to the axe.Specimen 7: Specimen 7's rooms are now a much darker red.Specimen 8: Very slow (you can outwalk it).Specimen 9: No noticeable changes.Specimen 10: Graphical updates and moves slightly faster.Specimen 11: Graphical updates and moves slightly slower. Immune to the axe.Specimen 12: Graphical updates and moves slightly faster.Specimen 13: Graphical updates."

The new features that are added bring the experience of actually not having to use a mouse and keyboard and being able to run the game on a Intel laptop. (For me that is.)I'm really impressed with the controls for the gamepad.And what I love about HD Renovation is how it still feels and plays the same as before, why fix what isn't broken right?However, there are a few things I need to mention which may contain spoilers.I have a feeling that this game isn't really ""HD"" because the textures mostly look the same as before but blurrier.Also some things in this game feel lazy to me, some of the specimens don't have their movement animations and come off weird to me. And in some rooms, there's no animation at all and they stick out.My last few nitpicks is the options menu, I feel that it may throw people off balance because of how confusing it is but then again I'm happy to have these options. Also is it just me or does the fact that there's an option of taking away the jumpscares and specimen completely ruin the experience for me?But enough of my complaints.TDLR; This is a worthy purchase if you love the game and want a good ride of nostalgia."

All of the menus load up behind me no matter what I do and all of the controls for forward/backward and left/right are reversed for some reason. There is also no way to change these manually in the options to fix it. I tried with both keyboard/mouse and with a controller. Reversed controls on both.

,Recommended,577690,30740305,Posted: 25 March,all,The Nebulator,"Alright, I'll say it: I have a strange love for this game for a reason unknown to me. I've been with SJSM since the beginning, the good old days when it had a correct title (Spooky's House of Jump Scares) and had not fallen prey to a group of ignorant German developers who make unoriginal mobile games. Man, that was awful.But anyway, onto the review. Now I already said I love this game, but for God's sake, don't make me pay $10 just to play it again with slightly better lighting and 3D models! When the remake was first announced, I was super excited, and all of the pre-release footage looked great.And then came the waiting. The game was supposed to be released on December 25, 2016. It got pushed to February 17, 2017, which I was okay with. If the game needs improvements, let it have its improvements. But when February 17 came around, it got delayed AGAIN to February 24. I was disappointed, but waited patiently. And then it happened AGAIN, delayed to March 1. At this point I was at my limit, but I was happy to see it was finally released on March 1st.I installed it, eagerly pressed play, and expected miracles. Here's where the REAL review begins.First of all, the main menu is a HUGE step up from what it previously was. In the old version, you could only use arrow keys to select things on menus, but now mouse support has been added, along with the main menu's background being completely recreated in 3D, which I personally found awesome.But then, (sigh), I actually started playing the game itself. My first disappointment came from the fact that Spooky didn't have her own 3D model. I guess they said that SPECIMEN would get 3D models, and never mentioned Spooky, but come on. She's practically the game's mascot, for crying out loud. So I pushed that thought aside and began running through the 1000 rooms. After about 100 rooms through, it hit me.It's exactly the same as the old version.Well, not EXACTLY. For example, there are new rooms, the Specimen have 3D models, lighting has been drastically improved on, but it just didn't satisfy me! As I sped through the rooms, I ranted on and on about stupid little details the *awesome* devs could have added. Color interpolation between pixels! How the sprinting speed had been slightly slowed! And the only other thing in the game that's even REMOTELY close to something you couldn't create with GameObjects in Unity is the Brain Room (which is the kind of quality I expected from the rest of the game). tl;dr, the game was too simple for Unity.There are some really good-looking games that run on Unity. The Forest, Stranded Deep, Cities: Skylines... but all I see in the SJSM: HD Renovation is cubes and an occasional cylinder. I know there's one more DLC coming for the game, and I really hope it's as good (if not better, and somewhat longer) than Karamari Hospital. Oh, and for everyone's sakes, make use of more 3D models, like in KH. The ones in KH were lowpoly, sure, but they were clearly not cubes.But I suppose I've said enough bad stuff about a game I sincerely love. Specimen 6 is a little more challenging than before. I like that. The 3D models for the specimen are great, Specimen 2 looks awesome (if not a bit taller than it originally was) Specimen 3 is the perfect balance between scary and hilarious, Specimen 4 takes on a revamped look, 5 fits with the area's theme perfectly, 6 looks perfect... I could carry on for a long time.So basically, what I'm saying is this: if you're interested in the game and want to try it out, get the free version and buy Karamari Hospital. You're getting pretty much the same game with an astounding DLC that the HD Renovation doesn't currently support. If you end up really liking the game, than go ahead and buy the HD Renovation--just don't expect many new things at all besides a new DLC that should be arriving some time in the next 100 years (that's the best estimate I can make ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ).And before I go, let me just state again that I really, truly admire this game in all ways possible--its story, art style, gameplay, etc. It's just that this version didn't quite deliver what I had in mind, but from reading all of their posts and updates, I can see that they went through some serious crap to get this version up and going. So many kudos to them for that.Just remember, you two... that next DLC. It BETTER be good.P.S. Next time you guys make an amazing game, don't cram 2 billion files into one asset package. I have a strange obsession for looking at game files, but I can't with this game because Unity Assets Explorer can't handle all those files.P.S.S. And don't worry, I'm not going to do anything bad with the files. It's just for fun and games and leraning purposes ;)"

Thank goodness I was able to use the new ""remove Specimens"" feature in the options menu!Spooky is still scary as ever!Edit: May 13, 2017: The Karamari Hospital DLC was released, and that's as spooky as ever, too!"

To be honest I'll make it short.I don't like horror games because im the type to normally need to sleep next to someone after because I flip my♥♥♥♥♥♥ I last played Underhell. This game was NOT that scary but this game will a few times make you go oh ♥♥♥♥ this. It has suspense and it's fun. It's very repetitive but if you can get past having to do alot of repeat stuff you will be okay.It has an odd way of telling a story and to be honest I could have gone for more story driven content. But it was a fun game that I could play again.I wish it had more difficulty settings, and individual specimen toggles"

,Recommended,577690,33489218,Posted: 12 July,all,Anal Crust,"As the title says, SJSM: HD is a graphically updated version of the F2P Spookys Jump scare Mansion with some additional content that the original doesn't have as well as including the dlc from the original.The story remains much of the same, a simple seeming facade over a much deeper story with subplots occurring within the mansion that keep you enveloped for all 1000 rooms AND the DLC. With he improvements to some environments, it offers a more in depth feeling that you couldn't get with the first. The places you run through have much more personality and make the story a little better from before.The graphics are more smoothed out and easier on the eyes from the first, and small details have been added to some rooms (like light rain) which adds nicely to atmosphere. On the other hand, though, most original rooms seem left out of these ambiance updates and remain still night outside, which for me breaks the flow a little bit. I can understand why it's in there, though, since the mansion is so convoluted anyway it does add to that theme. The boss encounters are changed as well, though to avoid anything, I'll leave it at the areas specific to them are revamped significantly too.I would say try the F2P as a demo of sorts, and if you like it, buy this game because it is the much superior version and supports the devs, who really went above and beyond recreating this game imo."
,Recommended,577690,34088112,Posted: 7 August,all,wubsum,this game is a little short but that was because I had rushed through it. this game is essentialy running away from spooky monsters who have little gimicks you have to follow. overall though I really enjoyed the atmosphere and would definitely recommend.

Ditch the complicated keyboard and grab your gamepad (you can use an old one). This gasme runs smooth as silk and if you sit back a bit with the Rift it seems to fix the grey flash problem you can run into with SteamVR.Also, this game is much harder than the original, getting past the first attack of a monster doesn't mean they won't respawn later. Happy gaming!"

I have played through it twice now, and yet it still manages to provide some fun. I would love to try this in VR down the road! Definately check this one out for a few jumpscares, a few chases, and some overall cuteness that just oozes from this game."
