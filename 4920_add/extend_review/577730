There is a hover mechanic, but you can alt-tab while hovering and it'll still count.This is a game designed to be put away for some time (in fact, some missions straight up require you to do that), so you can go do something productive knowing that there will be something interesting waiting for you when you get tired.The game sure has its flaws (grindy minigames, missions that lie to you, weird design for higher difficulty, appendix upgrade that does nothing AFAIK), but it's good enough as a productivity tool.It's also useful to learn some real scientific numbers along the way. At least definitely more useful than learning numbers like ""blue laser damage"", ""green dragon hp"" and ""bear butt drop rate""."

Buy it.It is culturally a clicker but isn't quite one because there isn't really an option to speed up gameplay by wearing out your mouse. You can speed (at least) one thing up by hovering over it, but clicking does nothing.The gameplay is rich with complexity that is slowly introduced and built upon as you play the game. This complexity is heavily based on Chemistry. You don't need a strong background in Chemestry to enjoy this game; however, you may have to reference things ingame or just a couple of different configurations to something to work. For example, you might need to place something over all the elements that make up Phosphoric Acid. This means you need to place a thingie over Hydrogen, Phosphorus, and Oxygen.I haven't experienced any bugs, glitches, or just obvious poor design. On the contrary, everything feels about right and there are lots of obscure things included. For example, hitting M on your keyboard while ingame will display information about the currently playing background music. This is not at all necessary for a game but is a mark of well thought out games."

There is very little not to like here. Only thing that annoyed me slightly are the missions that are handed to you. One even required me to quit the game and come back in 30 minutes and this wasn't even very far into it."

This one looks way better and has more options and apparently mini-games later on. There is also some educational depth about chemistry here.As a steam idle game it's not free but it has no microtransactions or pay2win either. The dev's English skills are limited but it's no problem as there are mostly one-liners and they do their job.There are cards, achievements and steam cloud support so yeah I think this work is really fleshed out and can be recommended."

Very StrangeSo, I'm here writing a review, because the game has asked me to stop playing for 30 minutes. I will progress my level a little bit, if I don't play it for 30 minutes. Quite an odd request, but hey, here I am.To be honest, I really feel like I have no idea what I'm doing, though I'll chop that up to not having played very much. I know I'm building a planet, using chemical compounds created out of harvested elements. I'm also helping to push evolution along by earning chemical bonds by creating more elements needed to create specific bonds.If that sounds a little daunting, that's because it is.The thing is, even though I feel kinda doubtful as to whether I'm actually doing it right nor not, I'm still progressing.IthinkI'm doing it right, but I still don't feel sure.This is not your average clicker game, not by a long shot. That being said, it is still quite entertaining, and I feel pretty sure that I'm going to get it all figured out within time.It's actually kind of nice to play a clicker/idle game that truly does require thought, througout. It's not just mindless clicking, you won't progress by opening it and just leaving it running for 300 days in a row. You have to do stuff, and that stuff does require at least a little bit of chemistry smarts.I would surely recommend this to someone who likes the genre (clickers and idlers), but who also doesn't mind a bit of a thought challenge.If that sounds like you, you'll probably enjoy this game."

The game follows the theme of the periodic table very well - for example the challenges will frequently be things like ""10 gasses [at 0 C]"", and you are regularly given a chemistry quiz for a temporary selectable bonus.It has several different things to do -- you have the normal upgrades you would expect from a idler game, but also you can apply zone bonuses to an entire zone (such as ""Noble gasses""), play a shooting mingame to 'know' elements to get an extraction bonus, find 3 hidden mini games, ....If you do all of the achievements, you will spend noticeably more than the ""10 hours of gameplay"" mentioned in the store description [at least at the time I write this review]. So it delivers good value for the money even if it is not something I see my self returning to often."

76561198022907259,Not Recommended,577730,32665825,Posted: 22 June,all,Hudson,"This game would be fun for an existing chemistry hobbyist, but if you have only a passing curiosity in chemistry you may not have fun when the game asks you to google chemistry topics.  The game feels like it is built with the ""I am not doing your homework for you"" attitude you occasionally get on the more pedantic science forums.  This feeling persists through navigation through the unique user interface that is subsequently confusing as hell.  I have played hundreds of games and used all kinds of software in my life, and while the UI in this game doesn't rank near something like ZBrush in outlandish design, it is definitely on the far side of awkward.  This would be fine if there was some help in understanding it, but that is not the way this game works.I think a useful way to understand what this game is or where it stands in the landscape of video games is to compare it against the game Spore.  For me, Spore was a fun adventure that anyone could enjoy.  It was also a game about evolution, but it didn't ask you to study anything.  Rather than a fun adventure, I think this game, Idle Evolution, fits best as a time-killer companion to a General Chemistry college class.  This is of course with my UI arguments notwithstanding.  I could see this as being something a chemistry student would use to ease off some of the pressure gained from studying without actually departing the world of chemistry.  What this is not, is another game like Spore for the casual gamer."

This game is fine and im sure there is a niche market for fans of this, however I do not fall into this group. Scroll to the bottom for a pros/cons list.For a long time I have enjoyed playing Idle and Clicker games, and have put likely thousands of hours of my life in them overall. I saw this game, thought it looked interesting and did some research. I found out there was an older version that was completely free to play online and I tried that out. After only a few minutes (I wasn't expecting too much to change throughout and the general concept of the game seemed clear enough) I decided I would purchase this game and see how it would work out. It starts out simply enough, and the tutorials are clear enough to get you where you need to be. It starts slow, like every one of these games, but I feel like the pace never picked up much since the beginning. The concept seems great, the gameplay was fine, but overall this game left me feeling like I wasn't doing much. You can argue that I only have 5+ hours played, which is true, but you also need to consider that time ""idling"" (not having the game launched) isn't counted for.Pros:-Great Idea, basing an idle game off the perodic table-Not a mouse clicking spam fest-Some education/testing of what you remember from schoolCons:-Extremely slow progression, with way more content unlocking than I can manage-This game is not free, if you are looking for a classic idle/clicker game there are many out there for free-Some of the hints get annoying quickly if you're watching the screen waiting for something (such as some quest requirements)Overall, I do not recommend this game because I do not think this is the type of game for everybody. As I said I consider myself a huge fan of this genre and this game just did not cut it for me. To anybody out there who loves this game, I hope you continue to enjoy it. For anybody looking for a new idle game, please take your time to try out other games first (including the free to play version of this online)."

Although I've given this game a thumbs up, I don't necessarily recommend this game. It is interesting from a chemistry/nerdy point of view, but the goal of the game is a little obscure, and there doesn't seem to be a lose state, meaning you can't actually lose.The game also reaches a point where it becomes incredibly grindy, and the reason for this seems to be that this game might be a mobile game that required in-game purchases. I'm not entirely sure that is true, but the UI and grindy aspect of the game seems to point in that direction.I would give this 5/10."
,Recommended,577730,31009855,Posted: 7 April,all,AlabamaAngyl,"This is an initial review which I will probably update when I get further into the game. As of right now, I am really enjoying this little game. I like that there is an educational aspect to the game, where it will minimize and take you to a wikipedia article regarding the element it wants you to discover, or the era your planet has entered. At it's heart though, it's your basic clicker, so I'd only recommend getting this on sale. It does keep you interested with mini games, educational quizzes, and other things, so it *is* worth paying for in my opinion. Most of my time is spent on the periodic table of elements, making discoveries."

If you are lacking in chemistry knowledge and element periodic tables, this game will jog your memory from what you learned in school/college.

76561197996050872,Not Recommended,577730,32754615,Posted: 24 June,all,No Scrubs,"TL;DR: If you really liked chemistry class, you might find this game enjoyable.While playing this game, I felt like I was back in chemistry class. Everything is related to elements on the periodic table and/or forming molecules with those elements, but the game refuses to even give you the common courtesy of showing an overlay of the elements on the periodic table - instead, you're presented with a blank version of the table with which you have to guess blindly until you find the right spots for what you want.Quests are often related to picking out the correct set of elements on the periodic table. An example of this system is ""be harvesting X number of elements with electronegativity value Y"". I would just place harvesters on random elements until I got the right combo, which ultimately just wasn't fun. I prefer games that don't feel like school work."

,Not Recommended,577730,31125659,Posted: 13 April,all,DoctorMO,"A very nerdy game that will entertain for a little while. It has some problems with design and I felt like the tutorial was more sadistic than helpful, in one example delibrately lying to the player about what the player must do and in other cases simply getting you to move collectors around over and over and over again. Which got kind of dull after you'd learned them.The ending is a bit weak. It's not a surprise in terms of twist endings. But the graphics do have a different tone from the rest of the game. And I noticed that in the knowlege section too, the graphics and sound of the little robots shotting the circuit board was out of tone with the rest of the game. I couldn't tell if I was a god, nature, aliens or what. But I could tell that I was inconsistant, whatever I was.I did like the meateor event. I thought it added a lot and more of these for each of the big geological changes would have been nice. I did enjoy the mini games and having a perminant bonus is a good idea as it adds tention to the mini game.In the end enough, I didn't feel like I had a lot to do with the resources I was building up. There didn't seem to be a good connection between the elements and the updates. Being able to use any number of elements to build upgrades made it feel like rote. Maybe it was the level I was playing at, but the game needs a bit more balance, a bit more design and a lot more coherence to make it a better game."

Or, it'd get to the title, and hang ""forever."" At some point, I was wondering if this might be my first refund, be I persevered. Still, video seems to not be the high point, here - and graphics (even ""full screen"") seem to get place slightly off-screen, or similar.That said, I've always been fairly fascinated with chemistry, and this brings some of it back. So far, I've not notice anything overly complicated, and a lot of it seems repetitive. Without trying to give too much away, I'd hope that it had a few more than just a handful of ""simple compounds"" for some of the ""quiz"" pieces.Still, it's a fun little game, a bit more than an idle clicker... definitely worth a few dollars if you like to pass your time playing games you don't have to think too much about... or, games where you can DEFINITELY think a lot more about, and optimize your experience."
