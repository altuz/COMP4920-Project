76561198043799506,Not Recommended,577800,34987422,Posted: 15 September,all,hollbish,"Strap in because this is the biggest money grab you've seen from 2k yet! I mainly play My Career so this review is from that prospective.Pros: Character models look pretty good. Gameplay feels smooth. I actually like how defense feels this time out.Cons: 2k has always been pretty greedy but this year just feels savage. First there are only about 5 hairstyles unlocked for your character at the start of the game. You have to pay for any other ones that you want. They also do not stay unlocked. If you switch to one hairstyle, then get a different one, you will have to pay to switch back to the first one.Sure the story in My Career is cheesy but it wouldn't matter if it weren't for that fact that... You can't skip cutscenes. This is unexcusable. When you make a character, it takes over an hour before your character is even able to play his first game in the NBA. Also when upgrading a character, you can't see how each upgrade point corresponds to each attribute point. Will increasing my ball handling increase my speed with ball attribute 3 points or 1? There's no way to know unless you hand over that sweet, sweet VC.Now that 2k has implemented the neighborhood you have to load into it to play My Player, even if you didn't plan on playing Park or ProAM!2k is lucky that they have addicts like me buying the game because they have proved time and time again that they don't care about their fan base.I will update this review as updates start coming out for the game.UPDATE: I just had MyCareer player data deleted. Apparently this is a common occurence right now that 2K is trying to push a patch for on XB1 and PS.... BUT no news about when/if this patch will be coming to PC. Just another reason to WAIT to buy this game."

The problems are clear as day:* Unskippable cutscenes (which just aren't very good) filled with jerk characters* Terrible optimisation if you don't use a controller (it took a help call to find out that page down was pause)* VC demands EVERYWHERE. If you don't want an 80s hair style you're expected to pay money.* Terrible MyCareer story which makes zero sense with zero ability to shape the tale* Clumsy shot controls and atrocious steal abilities* 'The neighborhood' is full of creepy avatars that get in the way of doing stuff* MyCareer difficulty is locked at Pro minimum - so good luck with your 60-rated schlub in the first season* Supporting app awards a maximum of 600VC a day. That's not even enough to get a hair cut.A disappointing cash-grab disguised as a basketball sim.

The ""Neighboorhood"" aspect of the game is useless, and both my gm mode and career mode have been bogged down with un-skippable cutscenes. Create a player is terrible. Optimization Is terrible.

Most sports games now have some sort of, 'build your own hero' mode, and that's the gist of MyCareer.The other reviews warned me, ""Don't buy this the Virtual Currency is way too expensive"". I thought, ""nah, I don't mind grinding."" Turns out that after playing for a few hours, I am so totally frustrated with my poor lvl 63 player, and the terribly slow accumilation of Virtual Currency (VC), that I am walking away from this game.It looks great, and I was starting to get a grasp of the controls. I love the tournament options, and the ability to manage my own team. Lot's of great content here.MyCareer has you walk around this neighborhood, sort of a hub for online players. And for whatever reason the game hitches/stutters constantly when I walk around. In a game, I can crank the settings to ultra and maintain great FPS (Good job on that) but for whatever reason the MyCareer Neighborhood is so glitchy.And finally, the setup wants you to spend real money on VC, or grind it out. Well, I already gave you sixty bucks, andI don't mind leveling a character, just like in any rpg right?!? I appreciate the offer to spend real money on cosmetic items, but for it to be a necesaty to enjoy playing the career mode is where I draw the line.I don't know what it would take for me to come back. Maybe if the rate of VC acumalation was doubled (or maybe more) the grind wouldnt' be so bad. But I've got a life, work, kids, I can't give this game the next few hundred hours of my life hoping to one day level my character up past ""absolutely terrible""."

You make about 800ish per game (there's no diffculty multiplier). Add in the less than lucrative endorsements and you're playing about 2-3 full seasons before you can actually make a layup.You can't skip cutscenes and this especially problematic when you're faced with the migraine-inducing ""B-Fresh"", a character so annoying that grinding for VC almost seems like a bearable alternative. Almost.My advice: only buy the game if you enjoy a huge grind (I've played about 20 hours and managed to get from 60 OVR to 62 OVR) and do not give in to the temptation to fork out $50 for VC to make your character decent.Go home Ronnie, you're drunk."

76561198001001841,Not Recommended,577800,34992590,Posted: 16 September,all,Eyelsi,"There is only one reason I bought this:MyCareer Mode.How is the career mode? Disappointing.Now, I'm not that much of a challenge-facer in these types of games.I really enjoyed the FIFA17 Career and heard this game had something similar.In FIFA17 I could use a custom difficulty and perform well in the end. Score hatricks and that gives me satisfaction seeing my Hunter progress like a star.In 2K18, you start with a 60 rating. To level it up you need VC. Either farm VC by playing matches that takes forever or you can BUY them. Now people understand the problem with buying it so let me talk about grinding the VC credits. The problem is that for me who isn't much of a fanatic in sports games, I want to go through the story seeing my character become a star. But that isn't likely to happen unless you're a mad master level in this game. They also blocked the use of custom difficulty so that I can't do easily well like I did in FIFA17. Some of you may think I'm cheating or whatever, but really I just wanted to enjoy the story and do well with few challenges. Now,Let's talk a design standpoint. In each game in the career mode, you start with a C rating. It is very difficult to reach the A rating because I felt they punish you more than they give rewards. Especially with a 60 rating, basically almost every game I ended up with a range from C- to B+. Now here's the thing, to reach a B+ rating you must do very well. An A rating is only for the incredible match you have. So for the first year being a rookie, even though the story tells you that you play awesome, you really don't. And constantly being rated a C and even a B when doing well still feels like an unfair judgement (also because you receive little game time).Personally, this is what killed it for me. I just really wanted to enjoy the game without playing it seriously is all I'm saying. And I'm not much of a sports gamer guy. Regardless of the expensive apparels they allow DJ to shop, the game feels very much like a paywall even after you purchased the game for $60. It's like they 'paywalled' you to a PVE content. I'd hate it if they paywalled for PVP but I would understand. But this is like fake online. Because as far as I played it the only online feature is pretty much looking at the other DJs and what they wear. Which isn't enough motivation to say the least.Take this review how you want it, this is my take on it.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First Edit:After this point of the review, I've finished my first rookie year of the Career mode.(I have a screenshot proof in my profile page)I now am a 87 overall sharpshooter. I easily obtain an A+ rating every NBA game and enjoy the matches more. I still believe my early assessment is valid regarding buying VCs and the challenge you face if you don't have enough of them however I am enjoying the game a lot more because of what my player can now do / do easier.The only negative assessment I'd add is the 'Park Games' or PVP games. Living in Asia, the servers seem to be very bad. I can't say for certain because I don't think they state it in the game but I feel like I can safely assume that the only servers they have is in America. I can stream 1080p YouTube just fine and I'd disconnect the first second I get into a Park Game. So there goes my Gatorade mission of doing 5 matches in a Park because that whole experience killed me. Thus I went back to the PVE NBA matches and regained my faith in the game."

Sure the shooting system is good, the overall graphics are bit better, the face scan feature is a vast improvement, and myGM mode is not bad. However, the developer did not learn their mistakes and not putting any effort to improve the gameplay further beyond, yet somehow they make it even worse than previous games. The weighty character movement is entirely slow the pace of the game down too much, the character customization is bad, the layup system is trash, and the progression is just an another exhausting grinding task because 2K think it is a good idea to ditch out the difficulty multiplier. There are also many issues never addressed. For example, the screens are still broken, the AI is laughably bad, and the player's animation is far worse than NBA 2k16/17 in comparison (how is this even possible!?)In the end, I cannot recommend this game for any longtime fan of the series, and I'll stay away from the franchise for a while.

Got an A+ grade, something like 15 pts, 9 assists, 3 rebounds and 1 steal, pretty good game for my 72 overall shooting guard.I got 852 VC from that game. If i want to upgrade my mid range shooting from 76 to 77 it costs about 2200 vc at the moment. So, I have to play 3 games to get the required amount.3 games= 3 x 30 mins =90 mins. If I want to play the games with boosted stamina I have to spend maybe an extra 15 min in the gym pushing random buttons so now we are at 105 min. Then we have the random amount of unskippable cutscenes and loading screens, let's round the total to 120 mins.So, roughly two hours of gameplay just to upgrade one skill by one in the mid 70 skill bracket. Not your overall level, one skill. And the skill is not like from 97 to 98.All this is avoidable by buying VC with real money, what a surprise. I don't know if I'm being paranoid but at this stage it really feels like the horrible cutscenes are unskippable just to slow down player progress and to nudge the player towards spending real money.Actual basketball mechanics are great but everything has been spoiled by pure greed. Game (and cutscenes) are full of product placement and sponsors, 2k sells 150 euro editions of the game and 2k aggressively pushes players to spend actual money.NBA 2k18 doesn't feel like a basketball game that's been born because the developers love basketball.

Remember when My Career was actually still about playing basketball games and advancing your character in NBA 2k14?My League remains unchanged from the past few years, which means it's probably still the only decent, non-VC-driven mode in the game.

You literally start at 60 ovr with no chance of doing well unless you use VC. It doesn't matter if you're wide-open or not, you miss 80% of any shot you take. Layups this year got even worse, you miss 90% of those(unless you have a wide-open aisle to the basket, which never happens). The same issue happens in myteam, wide-open or not does not matter, you miss the same amount of shots. Grinding schedules takes too long, and gives practically no rewards. Challenges requires a good team, which is impossible without VC or MT which cannot be acquired without having a decent team. The only thing worth doing is Domination, and even that takes 30 min each game, around 1000 MT each game(One league pack costs 3500 MT lol).

This means every game you want to play has virtually unskippable timeouts, halftime shows, pregame shows, player of the game awards, etc etc.I just wanted to play basketball, not get the awful experience of watching the modern NBA on TV with talking heads and commercial breaks."

Grinding and Grinding away for 200-400 games just to get your character to 80-85. If I were God, I would send these GREEDY GREEDY GREEDY makers of this game to hell. Seriously, they think this is good business? To offer you a game for $59.99 and then heavily provoke you to spend at least $10-20 more just to make the gameplay bearable? Why not just sell the game at one price of $70 then? Why make it unfair for people who's got less money. The gameplay in My Career was so horrible that you miss shots even when the shot feedback says ""Good"". I miss almost 50% of my shots that say ""Good"". Even FT's, I see ""Good"" release all the time, but nope ball hardly goes in. The game frustrates you to the point where you're just barely missing open ""Good"" shots because the game is forcing you to miss. I get it the AI has stepped up and they play better defense, that's great. This is the first 2K where this is so obvious. 17 was not like this, if you had your release down and on point, you will not be forced to miss just because your shot rating is 75. How many times do you guys see the ball go in and out of the hoop? Like what kind of physics is that? Greedy Money Hungry Going to Hell developer physics. Seriously, I think these guys are going to hell for this game. Anyone who had a part in forcing you to buy VC is going to hell. You can't even spend $10, and be decent, you will still suck. You must spend at least $20 and spend it all on stats. Not to mention the clothes you buy is now seperated from NBA and Park Mode. So you have to buy things twice, and spend up your VC twice as fast. GREEDY, GREEDY, GREEDY. You can't even keep your hairstyles, you have to keep buying them everytime. They lowered the price now because they probably saw people not buying alot of things, but still, you dont get to keep it. So they still win and force you to keep buying. 2K stop spending your money on pointless characters like Justice, and Shammy Chuck all day Wells. He's a horrible basketball player and takes horrible shots which makes your team suck. They do so many things to hold you back so you think about buying VC. Every single part of this game from My Career to My Team is a GREEDY GREEDY GREEDY effort from 2K to force you to spend more money. What about the young children, that just want to play a good basketball game? What about that kid that lives in the middle of nowhere with no internet? What about the kid that asked his parents to buy this game for months just to find out that he will have to use a horrible character or ask his parents for more money? It seriously ruins your experience finding out how GREEDY they are. Seriously, if 2K developers are taking all this money from us, what are they doing with it? Make a small town? GTA V has a much bigger open world then NBA's small town and its only $59.99 from day one. Never had to pay any additional cost for points just to make the game playable. Ofcourse you have to grind to get more stuff in their game as well, but you don't get the feeling that they're making it hard for you. You know that they'll provide ways for you to earn more money via the game fairly. But Nope, not 2k. Small open world (not even sure if I should call it open world) town. Horrible supporting characters/actors. Who the hell is in charge of where you guys are allocating your money? All the money we give you just for this? A small neighborhood with restrictions in every store. Oh your charcater is 65? well then you can't buy almost anything. Oh you get a Jordan Sponsor but can't even attain 90% of the shoes available just because your character sucks. Wow and you guys call this a Simulation? Cause in REAL LIFE, BASKETBALL PLAYERS CAN BUY ANY PAIR OF SNEAKERS, ANY HAIRCUT, AND PIECE OF CLOTHING WHENEVER THEY FEEL LIKE IF WHETHER THEY SUCK OR NOT. YOU CALL THIS A BASKETBALL SIMULATION? WHO THE HELL IS SHAMMY WELLS, HE'S NOT REAL? WHY WOULD YOU PAY MONEY FOR AN HORRIBLE SUPPORTING ACTOR WHEN YOU CAN SPEND IT ON IMPROVING ELEMENTS OF THE GAME.  ALL SHAMMY WELLS DOES IS CHUCK UP SHOTS AND TALK NONSENSE. All these added characters but the same problematic gameplay. Fouls where your player doesnt even touch the guy. All that money you guys cant even get the physics of player contact right. Practice drills where the rebounder can't get the ball , glitches out and you have to cancel the drill and miss out on the points. Why not fix these issues? Why not fix the dull♥♥♥♥♥crowd? Why can't I skip scenes? Why force someone to watch your dull storyline? No twists, no turns. Boring as ever. Look it's cool you added a small little town, which could be much bigger with more mini games that real nba players actually do. Like the fishing with PG13, Why not add a small lake and let us play mini games so we get more for our money? AGAIN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THE MONEY YOU ARE MAKING OFF OF US? WHAT ARE WE GETTING BACK FOR OUR $59.99? GAMES LIKE GTA HAS GIVEN US MORE AND MORE UPDATES EVERY FEW MONTHS, WHAT ABOUT YOU 2K? JUST TAKE OUR MONEY AND HOPE WE BUY THE NEXT GAME? WHERE ARE THE UPDATES, WHERE ARE THE EXPANSIONS? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GUYS DOING OVER THERE? I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT YOUR GREEDY WAYS. BUT YOU GET MY POINT. FROM A NBA 2K DREAMCAST PLAYER TIL NOW, YOU ARE ABOUT TO LOSE A TON OF CUSTOMERS BECAUSE OF YOUR GREED. TREATING PEOPLE LIKE THEY'RE STUPID, ITS AN INSULT. YOU GUYS ARE INSULTING OUR INTELLIGENECE BY SELLING US A GAME FOR $59.99 THINKING ITS COMPLETE JUST TO FIND OUT YOU HAVE TO PAY EVEN MORE JUST FOR THE GAME TO BE DECENT. SERIOUSLY? YOU JUST TREAT US LIKE WE'RE ALL MORONS WHO WILL PAY NO MATTER WHAT? THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU GUYS MAKE US SPEND TONS OF VC JUST FOR A SNEAKER OR HAIRCUT. IF I MAKE 750 VC A GAME RIGHT, WHY ARE SNEAKERS 2000? IS THAT REALISTIC? NBA SUPERSTARS MAKE 300K A GAME, SNEAKERS IN REAL LIFE ARE $200-$500. DO THE MATH, DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU GUYS? WHY ARE YOU GUYS SO BLATANTLY GREEDY? IF YOU'RE GONNA OFFER ME HALF A GAME FOR $59.99 WHY NOT TELL ME UPFRONT? OR WHY NOT JUST CHARGE $70 TO EVERYONE? WHY MAKE RICH KIDS WHO COULD CARELESS ABOUT $20-$50 HAVE AN ADVANTAGE? LIFE'S IS OFCOURSE NOT FAIR, BUT YOU WOULD THINK YOU COULD TRY RIGHT? TRY TO GIVE EVERYONE A FAIR ADVANTAGE. WHEN MY SHOT FEEDBACK SAYS GOOD I WANT MY SHOT TO GO IN 85% OF THE TIME, NOT MISS 50% OF THE TIME. IT'S STUPID, WHY SAY THE RELEASE IS GOOD THEN? IS YOUR GAME BROKEN? DID YOU SELL US A BROKEN GAME? YOU SEE WHAT YOUR GREEDINESS LEADS TO? DO YOU SEE? MAKE IT FAIR FOR EVERYONE, NO MATTER WHAT FINANCIAL SITUATION, NO MATTER WHAT AGE. YOU THINK THAT LITTLE BOY FROM A SMALL TOWN IN A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY IS NOT DISSAPOINTED AFTER PAYING $59.99 AND REALIZING HIS CHARACTER IS NOT ONLY TRASH, HE HAS TO GRIND OVER 200 GAMES JUST TO GET A DECENT CHARACTER, AND THE GAME WORKS AGAINST HIS SHOTS SO IT SEEMS LIKE HE SUCKS TO PROVOKE HIM TO BUY VC? YOU DEVELOPERS AREN'T JUST DEVELOPERS, YOU'RE THIEFS, CROOKS AND HORRIBLE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO GO TO HELL IF YOU CONTINUE THIS ROUTE. ITS THE THINGS THAT AREN'T SAID THAT MAKE YOU LIARS. SHOWING A GREAT OPEN TOWN FULL OF FEATURES, BUT WHEN YOU BUY THE GAME, OH..CANT USE THOSE FEATURES YET FOR ANOTHER 300 GAMES UNLESS YOU PAY $20. WHY NOT TELL US THAT UPFRONT? SERIOUSLY, NBA LIVE HAS BEEN CATCHING UP, YOU GREEDY GUTLESS HORRIBLE EXCUSES FOR A HUMAN BEING WILL NOT BE AROUND FOR LONG IF YOU KEEP THIS UP. BE TRANSPARENT, OFFER WHAT YOU SHOW FOR THE PRICE YOU'RE SHOWING. MAKE THE GAME FAIR FOR EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF SOCIAL AND FINANCIAL STATUS. DO GOOD BUSINESS. YOU GUYS THINK THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO GET CUSTOMERS IF YOU CONTINUE TO PUT OUT YOUR GAMES LIKE THIS? YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO FOOL PEOPLE A FEW TIMES, BUT THEY WILL EVENTUALLY NOT COME BACK AND YOUR BRAND WILL GO CRASHING. DO THE RIGHT THING. RIGHT NOW THIS GAME IS A RIP OFF. YOU HAVE LOST MY TRUST.

However I still feel like the odds are against me everytime I take a jump shot.Secondly, the grind is abosultely unreal and they are asking for wayyy more VC this year to even get you're character to 85 which isnt even close to the max level.Overall despite the extra content im more of a gameplay guy and this game falls short once again.-Unskippable CRINGE cutscenes-Unacceptable VC microtransactions left and right-Absolute BS animations sometimes when driving in for a contact layup.-Feels like 2k17 gameplay wiseIf you are just looking for the most authentic basketball game to PC then I'd reccomend it considering it DOES have smooth gameplay but alot of the ""Scams"" they are trying to pull just make the game unappealing and unforgiving.Gameplay feels the exact same as last year which i didnt like, dont get me wrong im not looking for anything innovative by any means, but i do think they should fix the problems that have been apparent in the gameplay since 2k16 and 2k17I would not reccomend to anyone on my friendslist however you still might see me play it because its the most up to date 2K."

Your career is funneled through an online hub that slows your game down to the point that you can hardly move. All the aspects of the career from buying clothes/ shoes to getting your hair cut goes through this laggy, crap stain of a player hub. When I finish an online mypark match the game freezes on the last shot, I get a network error and my game closes. You can’t play and stream video while in this hub as the game will lag so much that your shot inputs will be off. I have spawned into this hub inside a wall before, unable to get out. They have a subway short cut from one side of the hub to other that me and many of my friends have gotten stuck loading inside. My friends will get disconnected just by standing in the “I got next” spot. Mypark games get stuck and you can literally see two teams just frozen on the court. This garbage is borderline unplayable online.This game has no respect for your time. Cutscenes can’t be skipped forcing you to watch what has to be the cheesiest, cringe inducing, lame♥♥♥♥♥story in video game history. Their is a cutscene every time you enter and leave a building in the hub wasting more of your time. When you enter and leave your house the door man wastes your time with cringey, stereotypical doorman banter that is of no interest or consequence at all. Going into your house entrance you get onto an elevator and it asks you which floor you want to go to, there is only one other floor beside the one you’re on so asking us which floor is redundant. Then they ask us again on the way out of our house just the same. Not to mention the load times from one floor to the other is straight up unacceptable. Before every game there is a cutscene of next level cringetasticalness that I promise, you have to see to believe. How any of this “story” got green lite and shipped as a triple A, yearly copy and paste product blows my mind. So much of your time is forcefully wasted on stupid♥♥♥♥♥content that it kills anything the game does well.To those complaining about pay2win. Yes, NBA2K is pay2win and it has been sense the VC system was introduced years ago. I know going in if you want to compete online you need to spend more than the cost of the game or you need to grind the VC currency in game. This is nothing new.I will change my review as the game develops with patches but as of right now I cannot recommend."

I have always loved NBA 2K even when NBA Live was actually decent.  In my opinion the NBA 2K series has always been the best basketball game around without question.  This will likely be the last NBA 2K game I will ever buy.  These are the reasons:MyCareer is terrible.  You start at a 60 overall and its way too difficult to level up without paying money which I refuse to do.  It will take you all year to get your level up witout paying for it.The new MyGM mode was a good idea but turned out terrible.  None of the decisions from the story mode matter at all.  If you say no to something then the owner does it anyways.  You dont trade for a player, the owners son does it anyways.  The cut scenes are long and boring and again they are meaningless.  I have literally just hammered A to skip through evry dialogue option the third time through and not even read my choices and everything turns out the exact same.  Each team you take over has the same story so basically no matter which team you pick or which dialogue options you pick it will make absolutely no difference.Micro transactions are almost neccessary if you hope to actually compete with anyone online.As usual hackers and cheaters are rampant in online play.The one thing that I will say is positive is that the game on the court offline is at its best.  I you just want to play basketball offline and dont care about the GM mode then it will be great.  If you like MyCareer, are expecting great things from MyGM or if you like to play online then do not get this game.  2K needs to learn a lesson that this wont be tolerated.

It's basically a pay to win game when the entire game is based on VC. They make it so hard to get VC in this game that you literally try and look up ways to earn VC quicker because they made grinding in this game much longer. I played 12 hours in total and only reach my guy from a Level 60 to 67 when other guys are already at 86 within the first few days of release. When these guys buy VC it pretty much forces you into having to buy VC for your player as well. I play 5 min quarters and get about 600 VC, switched it to 12 min quarters and it only gives you about an extra 200 VC which is garbage. Playing in the Park only gives you about 200 max in VC which is pointless of even trying to level up there. All the good stuff can't be unlocked till you reach level 85 but if you trying playing legit, it's going to take you days and days of non stop playing to even reach that level with out buyhing VC. As far as gameplay itself, it's garbage as well. Free throws are extremely difficult even for a shooting guard and point guard. Open or light contested layups are sometimes missed for no reason and to top it off you still get a turn over/loose ball from just dribbling or trying to do a cross over. ANNOYING! Don't even bother trying to hold the sprint trigger while doing anyting because your guy gets glued to the defender. Really wish NBA Live 18 would've came to PC because that would've been my first choice. Completely dissapointed with this years NBA 2k18. Spend your money else where instead of buying this game.

In order to be competitive off the bat, especially in park, you have to buy VC or run with friends who are high ranked. The environment which 2K created is only for cash grab purpose for them.I buy 2K every year because I am a b-ball fan and there is no viable alternative at the moment. They clearly don't care about PC players. There is no reason why this game is so poorly optimized for PC. Even Nvidia doesn't officially support it. They never did anything about hackers and they will not do anything to fix these issues.The only good thing is gameplay is actually better this year. Such as shame that the rest of the game is terrible."

While VC was present in earlier 2K games, it was much easier to earn without spending actual money.Unless the nickel and diming on a full priced, AAA title is significantly scaled back, I will assume that this is 2K's business model going forward and will not purchase another of their titles.

76561198051036453,Not Recommended,577800,35239231,Posted: 27 September,all,hcfw.jfoonssi,"- The NBA 2k series has collected most money out of any game series. Reflecting that fact to the slimmest changes 2k Games make in their yearly full-priced releases of NBA games makes the NBA 2k game series hands down the worst game series ever produced.- The 2k Games company claims NBA 2k18 is a computer game. In many ways that does not seem to be the goal. The game camera is focused on the ball, not the player's assignment. For years, there has been complaints about excess automated movement of the players close to the basketball, so the user cannot actually control the players. Also, the layup button still does not exist. When players are free to take open jay the game intelligence forces them to get a blocked layup. When players should dive to basket, the iq forces them to stop and get blocked jay. And the offense playcalling is always automatic, not changeable to manual in the menu. Regarding these features 2k18 is more of a demo, not a real game.- There have been improvement requests in the community for decades now. 2k Games seems to ignore these requests. Being the industry leader in basketball games, they can more than afford to make a game their producers want, rather than the fans.- 2k NBA games are the only PC games, which crash my system at regular intervals.- The customer support does not test the bugs on the game, you have to do it for them. I tried this long procedure once. The bug was not fixed on the current ""game"", nor the next ""version/game"".- Compared to 2k17 the 2k18 game has been made more difficult to play mainly due to changes to the functions of the buttons on the controllers. I still am winning more games using keyboard than the xbox 360 controller. The past few years controlling the game by keyboard has been made more and more difficult. Perhaps 2K wants most users to use the same controller method. Or, more likely, 2K and Microsoft has made a deal to increase sales of 360 controllers, so once again the fans of the game series suffer the most.- 2k18 was advertized to be more intelligent in terms of directing passes to teammates. Due to button changes and possibly some other changes, significantly more passes go to the wrong player.- In the standard Play Now mode games, just trying to call a simple play is very descriptive of this game. The buttoning is so clunky it takes too long to call the play. The point guard is essentially unable to handle the ball during the time it takes for the user to button the play up. The offense iq automatically calls a random play, which is not preventable due to a long standing bug, so the user must be aware of that. The cpu controlled offensive players' movement isn't very intelligent. And some of the plays in the play book are just flat out designed wrong. In early NBA Live games it was possible to use 30 second shot clock. Not in this game. On top of these, passes are heavily weighed in going to the go-to guy of the play.- There is talk in the community how much this game series is only cashing customers. To ""justify"" taking money off of customers every year with a ""new"" 2k NBA game, some parts of the game must be deliberately broken. Impossible to say if this is true. But, this year the play Iso Pinch has been broken so, that the iso player fakes the playcaller more than the defender. Last year it was the Cut 42 Base Tri play that was broken similarly.- There are major problems in the core of this game and game series, around it, in the community, in the design, the financing. To talk a little about the actual basketball, a small child of, say, 10 years old playing youth basketball, should be able to tell this game doesn't seem to have a single designer who has ever played even amateur basketball. Point guards receive the ball always square footed standing, never on the move. The wings running the wings, but not cutting to basket, even on fast breaks. The big men sitting beyond 3-point line if they can't shoot. If they can shoot, then they are stupid enough to always cut to the basket.- Aside of the flaws mentioned above, it is possible to enjoy these games. In my play style, which is mainly MyLeague if I recall correcly, other parts of the game are mainly functioning. Because of the sheer number of very questionable decisions or non-decisions from 2k games, i cannot recommend this game. I love basketball. But this game series has made me sad and angry so many times, I decided to comment on it."

If they do not wake up and let the game be a game and not a maze of mircotransaction and bugs maybe I'll come back next year. But I am definately getting my refund from Steam right now.

Most people buy the game for myplayer so I can assure you will be dissapointed as it is severely pay to win. If you do not want to buy VC then you will spend several hundred hours if not more just to get to the 85 overall.Everything in the new neighborhood is basically inaccessable to you if you choose not to pay the $100 to get your player to the 85 overall.As I play a slashing/defender shooting guard, I find it is near impossible to get a good contest on defense for the badges. Even if I get a block it still wont tick as good shot defense for the badge.Gameplay is a bit better than last year but thats only because last year and 2k16's gameplay was absolutely horrible.With that being said however, there are still of the many broken gameplay mechanics in this game that were in previous titles. Cutscenes seem like they take as long as an actual game and cant be skipped. Your player still loses the ball from dribbling it off the defenders body and then it will still be out of bounds on you, whereas the cpu will not lose the ball by dribbling through you. Cpu defenders still somewhat warp to you as soon as you press turbo but at least this year you can drive by defenders. Timeouts or other stops in play can still take up to a full minute to resume while all players are on the court doing nothing. Shot stick moves are very inconsistent and there is no controller vibration to help you time your dribble moves. Defense this year plays more of a zone and will sag off corner shooters. Cpu defense this year hardly closes out on 3 point shooters.All in all dont buy this game for Myplayer unless you plan on spending another $100 to make him competitve.Offline gameplay seems to have improved slightly but is still far from a simulation.If they took all the resources they put into making all the pointless things in the neighborhood, like the music studio, and 2k zone,etc,  and put it into actual gameplay this might have actually been a solid game.I think they make the cutscenes very long and unskippable on purpose so that way in your 2 hour steam refund window, you dont actually get to realize how much of a trash can game you got."

Literally nothing has changed in terms of gameplay and story. Its the same old microtransaction riddled game that almost forces you to buy VC or else you will be stuck in literal hell for the next 30 hours of gameplay. They said the defence was fixed but why do i always see my shooting guard leave klay thompson wide open in the corner to come help on a dribble drive that was well contained? There is literally no reason for him to leave klay wide open which makes me wanna punch my monitor because it happens all too often during the clutch.Massive problems on the playground as it causes desync issues as everyones actions has to be loaded which causes stress on the servers, not only that but as soon as i get into a 3v3 game my controller stops working, even if i unplug it and use my keyboard all controls cease to work unless i alt tab out and into the game again. When i enter the subway to take the shortcut to the playground everyones player model gets hidden and when i line up for a game which has empty courts it tells me that my game has experienced an error and returns me to the main menu.More negatives, sometimes VC earned after a game is not saved, they do not show the attribute increase when spending vc on skills which makes you spend VC blindly, unskippable cutscenes which are cringy, awkward and plain boring to watch in which 2k said they spent so much time and money on the cut scenes but they are still super terrible.Overpriced shoes, apparel and celebrations and emotes costs way too much and need a specific overall level to unlock which is downright stupid, why do i have to pay 2000 VC to flex my muscles and be a 85 overall to do such a simple thing?Offense in this game is a joke, NBA teams when theres 10 seconds left on the shotclock run plays and try to create scoring options, in this game the programing is so bad the ball handlers literally holds the ball at the top of the key and waits until 5 seconds to do anything, in which case they usually miss or they make a super contest well guarded 3 from near the half court line. There is no winning in this game as you could be up by 30 in the 4th quarter with 5 minutes to go and when you get subbed back in you find yourself loosing by 10 for no reason whatsover.There is so much negative in this game that has made me furious i even spent 75$ playing this trash game which i tried my hardest to play as i didnt want to see my money go down the drain. 2k was smart to make the prelude of the game atleast 2 hours of unskippable cutscenes as once you have made your myplayer it would already be too late to steam refund this game. GOOD MOVE 2K SO SMART THIS YEAR.Let me just say iv been playing 2k and have been a fan since 2k12, but sadly my past 3 games have be absolutely trash and cringy with so many bugs that it could be considered a alpha version, not a Triple A game that had millions spent into developing it.I will never ever in my entire life buy another NBA 2k game unless the reviews after 2 months of the release are extremely positive or its on sale for 10$. Please anyone that is thinking about buying this game take it from me, you are better of saving your money and spend it elsewhere where you will be happy, because playing this game has caused me to extremely unhappy whilst playing."

76561198302953671,Not Recommended,577800,35049134,Posted: 18 September,all,eddiecest,"UPDATED REVIEW 9/29/17: For now I have to give this a thumbs down. I am hoping some patches and updates might change this review, if so I will update this, but for now I am a bit disappointed, when comparing it to 2k17. I am actually more of a fan of MyGM than MyCareer, so I will start off with that. There is a ""story mode"" this time around with MyGM, which I see where they want to go with it, but it just seems very sloppy when you look at the story mode that is MyCareer. No voice acting, a lot of hand gestures when talking to staff/players, it looks outdated. Past the visual though, what I loved about 2k17 MyGM was that I could start the mode before the Draft, so it actually felt like my team. I would imagine IRL, one would hire a new GM in the off season to rebuild the team in his/her view and it was great that 2k17 let you do that. 2k18 though just has you starting in the start of the season. Also another cool option in 2k17 was expansion teams, so you could go through and expansion draft, and I could bring back the Sonics without having to move any other team from their city. (NOTE: You are able to do off season start and expansion draft in MyLeague, but its not the same as MyGM)The story in MyGM is very lineal. You start off choosing which team you want to play as, and in each description it tells you the difference between Owners, but it does not matter through the Story Mode of it all, because that Owner will disappear.  There is even a pointless button to change the Owner's personality in that menu selection, which again has no reason to exist. The story mode has you go through a situation in which the Owner sells the team to another owner and you have to deal with all the nonsense that happens in between. The Owner requests trades to happen for players that have no value or make no sense to have in your team, so please don't play as your favorite team because you will be mutilating the roster, or you can do something different and press the A button and skip every dialogue and choice available, because at the end of the day your choices have no effect on your job. The Original Owner for instance has a thing for VInce Carter, so he asks you to trade for him, which I do, no big deal. A week later he sells the team, fine. 2 weeks later Vince comes to my office to tell me he is going to retire after this season, I get it. Two weeks after that though, I have an upset Vince Carter because I didnt extend his contract?!?!?! How does that make sense? Then I have the New Owner asking me to trade for a Top 3 Draft pick.....in December and he gets mad at me because I ignored his request. That request should be made Off Season, not in December when there is no clue who is going to have one of the Top 3 picks. The New Owner then has me hire his son as Assistant GM and the dude makes a deal that his Daddy Owner wanted you to pull off. You can try to pull off the trade but the other team will not let you, but lo and behold when the trade deadline comes around the son is able to pull the trade behind your back, only for you to react either understanding or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but neither choice has an effect on your job. I have gone off on the new owner's request and chosen every single choice to go against him and I still have a job, I don't get suspended, I don't have certain GM responsibilities taken away from me, there are no repercussions. And the kicker is, The New Owner ends up selling the team back to the Original Owner, so everything that you just did for that one season DID NOT MATTER!!! I have started three different MyGM games, all three different teams, yet all three of them have the same story, no matter how different the description each owner and team is, it does not matter. You then go into the off season being told that the draft class is like the 2003 draft class, but past the first 3 picks, the rest of the players are trash. I like that 2K is trying to make MyGM more exciting, but the story line is a joke, it's not even believable, the DJ storyline is more believable than this one. Teams don't get sold that quickly and then back again in any Sports League, there's a lot of work that goes into it. And if I am to answer an owner with so much disrespect, I should be fired (and its game over), or I should be suspended/fined, or have some of my responsiblities taken away. There is a lot of work that needs to be done in MyGM, and the best thing I can suggest is make the story mode optional for now.As for MyCareer, well most other reviews have touched on it as is, I agree with most regarding the server issues, I know I have fast interent speed on my end, and my controller is up to par and all, but I have to wait 3 minutes to get back in the ""neighborhood"" only to walk to team practice or the loft or get in a game, wait 3 minutes there to load and then once again to load back to neighborhood mode some more minutes, it gets annoying, because there isnt much interaction I have with other players just by walking by them on any street or corner, unless im going up against anyone on the courts or in the 2kzone, if so, then the neighborhood mode should be then just accessed for those events, but not when all im trying to do is build up my player. Let me be able to go to practice, the gym, the store, the barber shop, my agent's office, and the loft without having to deal with the neighborhood experience. Then once I have my stats up, ill walk all over the streets, which in itself is a mission because my character swerves to the left/right, starts running in circles, basically does the opposite of whatever im doing with my controller at times. I associate it with the servers if anything.As for any other modes in the game, I really havent checked out other than Play Now to see the All Team teams, and thats pretty cool. Hopefully with future updates some of what I mentioned can be fixed, although I think I need to accept MyGM for what it is unfortunately, and well grind for VC then, which my thing is always grind on MyGM and then use that VC over in MyCareer. If my opinion changes, i will make sure to reflect it here."

Wait, I am referring to the offline mode.Initially I played normally and was in a vc grinding mode. However, when the 2k server was down and i can't load onto the mc saves, i gave up and thought might as well try the offline mode. And i was totally blown away!. The offline mode saves me from the lengthy (and unskippable) story mode and unbearable loading time, it enables you to progress your character normally and most importantly, this time i am able to upgrade badges normally (by using skill).This is so cool over the 2017 experience. Will i recommend the game cos of this? Absolutely not! This is not the gaming experience 2k had intended for us. It had intentionally deprived us of the story and other UI benefits (i do wonder where it gets the confidence that we would want these), and thought that we would be forced to give up the offline mode and instead give more money to vc.Quite to the contrary, I for one love the offline mode this time round. But I would not recommend 2k18 and most likely than not would not be following on 2k19. If you have other games in your wishlist, buy them, dun waste your money on 2k18 unless you are a diehard fan-- in which case my review is not going to be helpful anyway, you already know what a company 2k is."

Apparently they didn't like me trading Porzingis and Noah because the game crashed instantly.Honestly I'm going to go play the 10 dollar game I bought thats 8 years old and probably have way more fun and no blood pressure rise.Would reccomend 2k17 over this, at least it's updated and the game didnt crash/freeze/lag for me once in 300+ hours while this is crashing and laggy everywhere except menus and the ONLY upside I see is the minor mechanic changes and updated roster (which you could update on 2k17 anyway). I sincerely hope the console version is better but it wouldn't surprise me if that was bad too. I'm only upset because I was really hyped for 2k and the NBA season and this game not only didn't break any ground, it may have even gotten worse.I didnt even have to mention the INSAAAANE amount of selling out and microtransactions. It's just honestly ridiculous that there isn't any companies that make good games, they all just meet a deadline and pump out some♥♥♥♥♥♥game with a similar game engine to early 2000s basketball games and pay to win format."

,Not Recommended,577800,35055545,Posted: 18 September,all,D3nni,"This review is for MyCareer Mode onlyI've been a fan of the series since about 2K10. I religiously buy into this series for the MyCareer mode. I love the aspect of building a player that looks like me and living a childhood dream of proving myself and playing in the NBA. However, 2K has crushed that dream in this edition of the 2K series.Every aspect that makes building your player worthwhile, is locked behind VC, 2K's in-game currency system. Some items are even locked depending on what your overall player rating is. Earning VC is even a tiring grind that takes upwards of 200+ hours to accumulate enough to get to 99 overall; something they've heavily implemented into being a big deal this year. Tattoos, clothing, hairstyles, animations, emotes, etc are all locked for new players until they're able to accumulate enough VC to upgrade their stats, or just outright pay for it.Besides the P2W aspects, MyCareer mode is plagued with a story that I'd put on par with 2K16; a steaming pile created by ""genius"" that is Spike Lee. There are so many useless dialogues that add nothing to the story. There are countless times where a character tries to be funny that falls flat each time. They throw all these characters at you at once, but not a single one has any notable qualities that are even worth mentioning. Not to mention, all of these cutscenes areUNSKIPPABLE. From the time I launched the game, until I was in the new hub area and able to quit, it took me about 2 hours due to the cutscenes. As cheesy as it was, I really enjoyed last years ""Orange Juice"" duo and I'm really missing it this year.PROSNew hub area (while gimicky, I think it's a pretty neat addition)Models look slightly better this yearCONSP2WVC VC VC VC VCStory is significantly worse than last yearI have to pay VC to get a different hairstyle other than the6default ones.Incredibly long load timesTerrible companion mobile app that doesn't work half the time (You need this if you want to scan your face into the game)Clumsy shot controls and atrocious steal abilitiesI can't recommend this. While it's fun, it's also extremely frustrating and grindy. AAA gaming has taken a turn for the worse over the past few years and this is just another example. This is about on par with a ""Gotcha Mobile Game."" I shouldn't have to shell out hundreds of dollars after initially paying $60 just to get the full experience."

This is the first installment that is so bad I asked Steam for a refund.  The controls are slow, the graphics are glitchy, and the loading is horribly long, even on a SSD system.  But thats not the worst part, the microtransactions are ridiculous.  It was getting bad in NBA2k17 but this time its a whole lot worse.  Your player absolutely sucks and grinding is so slow in this version its almost not an option, especially with the loading times and now you have to move your player from one place to another.  I always loved the MyPlayer experience.  This one is very poorly done and seems the only motive for the way its presented is to get players to pay to upgrade their player through microtransactions.  $59.99 wasn't enough (I remember a couple years ago the PC version was $29.99 on release day), no they will try to milk you for every cent.

This game is full of bugs and issues, of which, I would like to point out.The endless grindThis game is riddled with microtransactions to customise your character (tattoos, facial hair, hair style etc.) and more importantly how to level up your MyPlayer. Now the concept of spending VCs on your MyPlayer isn't new. What is new is the amount of VCs required to max out your MyPlayer. You need approx. 200.000 VC to reach 85 rating, which is an insane amount; considering that player salary is bugged (I have not recieved several salaries) and an extremely low income from salary (there is no VC multiplier depending on the difficulty) and your starting MyPlayer rating of 60. Since NBA 2k17, 2K has implemented the Player archetypes system to specialise your player. While it sounds exciting, your MyPlayer's maxed rating in their specialised categories (i. e. Midrange shooting etc.) is often worse than other NBA superstars. This archetypes is less rigid in 2K18, but it is still a step behind as badges have to be earned by a grind in the training center and actual gaming. Since the amount of progress points depend on your successful execution of the respective badges, your starting MyPlayer won't be doing well in these regards. To sum it up, MyCareer feels like an endless grind and this grind can only be relieved by purchasing VC to make a decent NBA role player. The question is: Do you really want to do it and are you willing to pay an extra 20-50 bucks on top of the 50 bucks for this 2K17 1.5 game?MyCareer storyOne of the enjoyments of playing MyCareer is the immersion that you get by customising your MyPlayer to your taste and the MyCareer story. Now in 2K18 character customisation has become extremely expensive (100-1500 VC for a hair cut, 3000 VC for a tattoo, etc.) and is often restricted by your player rating as well. The story this time is uncomfortably cringy and the humour in this game most of the time a miss. Now the 2K18 universe is set in a fictional city, which feels artificial, generic, lifeless (aka non-immersive) and riddled with branding."

I used the reflex machine and when I first used it for 3 stars I would get .9-1 point, now for the same 3 stars I get .4-.5 points.. HALF A POINT for a gold performance.You are better off just playing games and building badges through your play.I can not see the point of grinding THIS hard for a character I wont be able to use after this year.END EDIT.MyCareer is no longer a favorite of mine in this game. The cut scenes you can't exit out of are so boring. I bought this game to play basketball not watch a movie of 2 dudes talking smack in a locker room.I dont like they got rid of the draft but that is honestly the least of my issues with the game.The open sandlot is a nice touch but again I bought the game to play basketball not run around a neighborhood.Not a fan of the training this year.  Upgrading is going to be a chore( moreso than previous years)  and seriously takes away froom the game IMO.I probably picked the wrong team but only playing for 5 minutes a game gets rather boring, especially when you add those cut scenes you cant skip.Just overall my first impressions of this game are one of utter disappointment in MYCareer. I guess I will be delving more into other aspects of the game.Tried MYTeam and I really cant get over what a cash grab this game is. You spend 5.5k on a pack of cards and get ONE player and 4 pretty much useless cards. You are LUCKY if you can pull a gold.. Its all silver and bronze. This game is such a joke.It has been getting worse and worse every year and this is the icing on the cake.This will be the last 2K game I ever buy!!!"

Your character will arbitrarily be assigned playing time and because of your low ratings, accruing stats (which earn you upgrade coins) is tedious and annoying.

Very frustrating. There are just so many issues with the gameplay it should be called an early access game.Currency/EconomyThe biggest issue I have with the currency isn't so much the microtransactions as it is the amount of content locked behind your overall rating. Combined with the very little amount of vc (Virtual Currency) you can earn per hour. It is noticably a lot less than the previous years. Read into that what you will.Story of MyCareerThe story has always been corny and full of product placement. This is another level of corniness. Every single cutscene (at the time of writing this) is unskippable and goes on for a very long and unneccessary amount of time. I refuse to believe a room full of grown men wrote this story.

More useless, unskippable cutscenes before AND AFTER matches.Removed the prostick from the ability to steal, so now instead of select and Y being intentional foul buttons, now you have THREE intentional foul buttons.The story took a massive left-turn and worse than ever before; you don't play high school games or college, you just play a dumbass tournament and effectively get drafted through a training camp with whatever team you want to play for - how absurd.Archetyping did slightly get better with the ability to mismatch, so you can actually play as Superstar instead of just forcing yourself to be one. It's not all roses though; no picking defense makes you literally worthless on one side of court and not picking something shooting based makes you worthless on the other end. Shot Creators still suffer the idiocy of their own classes by forcing themselves to take bad shots.The game makes you not want to play, it actively seeks to ♥♥♥♥ you over and dishearten you from playing. It'll lid the ring so you will miss open layups, open threes, open close jumpers, open mid-range jumpers, open dunks and all your assists will miss too, so you'll come into the 2nd 25 points down with a TFG% of <10% while the opposing team with be 80% from the field.There's also this phenomenon where the game does not register the movement patterns you input; it will not register a drive and dish (and even if it does your player has the body control of a child and throws the ball as hard as he can at the players head), it will not register the direction of an acrobat lay up, it will not accurately reflect dribble patterns, and it will not under any circumstances dunk on a drive after a dribble move no matter how much I try and hold the buttons to do it, even on fastbreaks.Teammates are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who don't play defense and will often to refuse open shots and pass for open shots and fastbreaks.Oh yeah and they added an ""open world"" which is just a massive cop out. ♥♥♥♥ you 2k you pile of garbage money grubbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥s."

It definitley needs some updates to be better than 2k17,Cons:-my child plays the game as well in mycareer but the lowest difficulty it goes for mycareer is pro unless I am missing something.-When adding tattoos to your player you have to buy them or pay to remove them each time.-Also cannot see good angles on adding the tattoos-Hairstyles and beards change during the barbershop visits, one day they have certain ones and then next they are different.-I would like the old side options menu back like you had in 2k17 for mycareer.-It feels like mycareer development was soley developed around the neighborhood because everything else seems under developed-Really hope they put out some updates soon for the game.-Not sure if the same issues are occuring on other consoles or only PC-Limited customization options for my player headscan, where previously you could use the head scan but still make changes after such as side profiles and make changes to the face that maybe the scan tools didn't get.Pros:-It is NBA2k18 updates rosters, new players, new uniforms, somewhat better graphics, aside from it seems like all of the players have big heads.-New shot meter is nice above the head instead of under your feet-The neighbor hood thing is ok but I would still like to be able to just play by myself instead of an area where a bunch of people are just walking around.-The face scan tool seems to be a little better but I like how myplayer looked in 2k17 as opposed to this one.I understand this game just came out but it feels rushed and more like a money gimmick than anything because everything seems to cost more or you have to be up to a certain overall rating to unlock.The neighborhood gave you the ability to walk around to places but many of the things I liked about 2k17 are not present in 2k18 and that needs to be fixed and updates or this game will have negativity written all over it.Do I recommend this game?Not at the moment it has pottential but it needs updates for it to be great game that was highly hyped."

After the last update my game keeps crashing if I try to finish the game right before the All Star weekend. I tried to sim that game and the game immediately crashes at the end. Then I tried playing it manually and it still crashes.So right now I am stuck in a game that I can't finish, which means I can't make anymore progress with my character, or play online with friends, or play my court! Get your sh*t together 2K. This is ridiculous.-Close to no changes made to stuff like the main menu and pause screen. Are you really this lazy 2k?-My Career = Pay-To-Win. If don't want to grind for 200 hours to do good in MyPark right away, you will have to pay another 60 dollars (which I did). You need around 200000 vc to go from 60 to 85. Yes even after you do all that you can ONLY go as high as 85 overall. Then you will have to grind in order to get some further attribute upgrades. This s*cks a$$ as you can't make changes to things like the match-ups or run plays until you reach 90 overall.-Sculpting feature for my player appearence is removed. You can only choose from a few preset heads and your ear/mouth/nose etc. If you don't do face scans then you are not in luck.--Again I gotta say 2K is greedy af this year with the microtransactions. You can't even see the changes you are making to your hair styles until you pay for them, and the good ones cost like 2000 vc each.-The difficulty changes in My Career doesn't change much of the gameplay really, except it helps ppl like Andre Roberson to go 6/6 from deep everytime I play him with his 61 3PT rating, while my character who has 73 can't hit any wide open 3s on the same difficulty.-Just like in 2K17 every 2 or 3 games a player gets injuried, either on my team or the opposing team. I found a work around though if you can't stand this bs: as soon as they get injured save and quit or close the game and enter again.(I remember playing quick games in 2K17 and injuries happens every game, including one of Spurs vs Warriors where both Kawhi and Gasol got injured in the 3rd quarter. What a joke lol)--'Loading Screen Simulator' takes over whenever the game switches between post game, the training facility, your home, and the neighbourhood.-Unskippable cutscenes, which is fine until I saw B-Fresh, aka the most unlikeable/annoying character in 2K history ever. Whenever I see that goofy lil worm I want to bi*ch slap her so bad. Who thought of adding someone like this is a good idea huh???-Post moves are useless against CPU as they will never fall for your pump fakes. They know exactly when you decide to take the shot and will block you clean every single time. Only thing you can go for is the fadeaways or the hook shots.-No shot meter when you attempt layups but your release timing still affects the shot.-Sheet servers on release as usual.Only reason I didn't get a refund is because of the addition of my 04-05 Spurs and all the all-time teams.-主菜单和暂停界面基本就是从2k17照搬过来的。-生涯模式还是一贯的尿性，想玩的开心就交钱。2K你咋不上天呢？老纸换个发型都要先买才能看，一个发型还要差不多2000vc。-球员从60升到85需要多花60刀（差不多200000vc）。想升到85以上还需要不停的训练和打比赛，到90后才可以跑战术。每次看威少背打我家帕克就心疼，自己却没法换防。-球员长相只能换整个头以及眼睛耳朵什么的， 不能再像以前那样随意改变球员长相，扫脸的除外。-增加难度除了提高电脑命中率和降低玩家的就没变化了。雷霆的Andre Roberson3分评分61，每次打我投的比库昊都准，两场分别是4/4和6/6。我自己73的三分，release timing至少都是'good'，大空位一个都进不了。-每打几场必有人受伤，打个quick game都能给我伤两个，虽然马上退游戏重新进就可以避免这些。-过场动画跳不了，每次看到B-Fresh我都想锤她，太讨厌了这人没事就瞎逼逼。-低位单打对电脑没用，从来都不吃你的假动作，除非你出手否则他们永远不会跳，只要你一出手就给你盖掉了。我还是投我的后仰吧，MMP。-上篮和投篮一样要算时机，但投篮条给去掉了。Excuse me???-一如既往的辣鸡多人服务器。要不是有我刺04-05的冠军阵容我早退款了，辣鸡游戏。"

,Not Recommended,577800,34986050,Posted: 15 September,all,The Legend 37,"Backstory: I have been playing NBA 2k since 2K15 was on PS4, (I didn't have a computer at the time), and I have enjoyed each iteration of the game a little more than the next but after how lackluster they were with the PC release of this game, not allowing PC players to play the perlude while people on PS4 and Xbox could really shows where 2K is with it's PC port. Sadly they do not care as with the rampant hacking in last years game in both the MyPark and MyTeam was very disappointing, I decided that everyone decides a second chance so I said eh what the heck I will give NBA one more year on PC before I end up switching to a more legitimate player base on either PS4 or Xbox (MEANING LESS HACKERS, I enjoy playing other games on PC). I have played NBA 2k18 for around 8 hours here are a few of my thoughts.Pro's: They game is fun, I really enjoy the gameplay aspect of the game it plays really smooth like a basketball game should. The graphics are the best in the series, the new jersey's look really good and the updated player models look really nice it seems like a very realistic game. The UI is very fluid and works well switching through menu's with a breeze is always a good thing and NBA does that right.Mixed: I am typically a big proponent of the be a GM or Franchise mode in sports games and when I saw that NBA was adding a sort of story mode to the Be a GM game mode I was in a way excited for a change as it got repetitive using the same methods that I have used in other games to either re-tool or rebuild teams. I can sadly say that I am not a big fan of the story aspect. The dialogue that the owner uses is 95% of the time has nothing to do with basketball or the franchise which is disappointing, while having a little bit of non-basket dialogue is ok the amount of pointless and irrelevant conversations in this mode is sad. I do enoy the new player interactions and I am happy that they got rid of the increase practice intensity problem as that has caused me personally a lot of grief in the past interations of NBA. Nothing other than the story aspect of GM mode has changed which is a good thing, but I absoulutely hate having UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES I hate having to follow a structured story as I like to create my own story or take my own way not some forced and boring story mode.Con's: When looking at NBA's flaws there is only one major flaw that I have noticed that drives me insane is the changes to career mode and the base game mechanics. The run the street is an interesting idea but I am not a fan. I enjoyed the easy interface just being able to buy items for my NBA career in the Navigation bar as it was a quick and simple process, now I have to walk down a street only to find out that I have to be a certain overall to get into the footlocker store or the NBA store which is quite a nusicance, while it gets people to interact with eachother I enjoyed last years method of purchasing items over this years. I have enjoyed the the normal gameplay aspects of 2K games since NBA 2k16 and every year it seems like nothing ever changes except little things that weren't a problem the year before but are a problem now. For instance I find the changing of the shot meter for the second year in a row to be a little frustrating, just as I seemed to be getting to understand the new shot meter 2K decides to change it up on me and for what? I personally find the new meter to be harder to see than past meters. I have also encountered a lot of bugs, I have played NBA 2k for the past 3 years and haven't encountered any major game breaking bugs but on my first playthrough of the be a GM my game decided to freeze and corrupt my save, while I wasn't very far into this playthrough I still found it annoying that I had to start my game over again. As of the time of this review I have had the game freeze or lock up 4 times.Conclusion: NBA 2K18 is the best basketball experince you can have on PC, however over the past 2 years little to nothing has changed therefore I cannot recommend anyone buying this game save your money or at least wait until this game is on sale it does not justify having a $60 price tag for a simple reskin I can happily say I will not be buying another NBA 2K until a major change happens or they listen to the PC community and start to crack down on the cheating and hacking in 2k, as much as it pains me to say NBA 2K is barely worth the 4/10 I am giving it only because I enjoy just playing the normal game. NBA 2K18 4/10"

I enjoyed the attempt at making the career mode immersive.No ability to skip cutscenes.  Microtransactions are taken way too far in this year's title.  Tattoos, shoes, accessories, etc for your career player are locked behind a rating requirement. This isn't a big deal but there is currently a bug that does not reward virtual currency (VC) following NBA and Park games.  The difficulty modifier has been removed, making it more difficult to earn VC.  I have never received any of the endorsement rewards following a game (bonus VC each game).  Team AI is just as horrible as it has always been.  If you are playing a career as a forward or center it can be especially frustrating as the AI does not seem to understand basic pick and roll principles.I can't recommend this title with the way the VC is set up and the push to spend real money beyond the $60 for the game."

NBA 2K16 MyCareer Mode, while not all that great for everyone from a stroyline perspective, had great gameplay minus a few graphical hiccups here and there. PS4 GameplayThe storyline for NBA 2K17 was a major improvement from the previous year. From the start players aren't forced into the shoes, for the most part, of someone else as far as race is concerned. Secondly, the stroyline is eaiser to follow and relate to for most people, in that its the classic case of high shcool phenom to pro. Moreover, the achivements of getting a shoe deal, obtaining badges, and creating a legacy are basically handed to you. NBA 2K17 MyCareer Mode, was a major impovement from NBA 2k16  in every aspect, expecially if your a casual gamer.  ""I'm the President of Basketball and I approve this review"". PS4 GameplayNow once again let it be known I've briefly played NBA 2K18 and this is what I gather so far.The storyline of NBA 2K18 starts out great in that players are going from street baller to pro baller. However, once you get past signing with your favorite team the stroyline tries to go the happy / comical route. Keyword *tries*. Its literally one of those things one would have to see to belive.  For some, this new happy / comical route will be a welcoming new twist to the NBA 2K storymode for others it will be very different to borderline strange continuing downward to annoying. To make matters worse for some you can't skip or at least I don't know how to skip the cut scenes.The MyCareer game mode is partly constructed in an openworld sandbox that runs similar to a mmo style game (aka lag city when to many people gather in one place). Want to change your hair style, threads, access a game modes like Pro-Am, Pick-up Games, etc?  Get ready for a walk around the town and hopefully the city won't get to crowded or worse overcrowded with other players.I tried to reamin unbias in my review and give the facts from what I can recall from previous NBA 2K games and NBA 2K18. I will say that NBA 2K18 isn't for everyone since its a leap in gameplay, gamestyle, and stroymode from the previous versions. Considering that NBA 2K18 MyCareer seems like the start of going in a new direction from previous years I would only recommend this years version for the more adventurious / hardcorce NBA 2K gamers."

All it has to be is the same EXACT implementation as in MyLeague, but it is still not enabled. Are people playing in MyGM mode really satisfied to sim all their game and never see the players play? I am tired of asking nicely. Maybe the dev team will take note of the feedback in a negative review. I would change my review to positive if this was implemented."

There are graphic interfaces that are exactly the same from 2k17.  Meaning they did ZERO work on it and just copy and pasted things.  COPY AND PASTE.  Want to MyLeague and add a few expansion teams?  Well the interface will be very familiar to you if you played 2K17 because it's exactly the same, like, all of it is exactly the same.  You may even be confused if you may have accidently started the wrong game.They put minimal effort into this game. Sad thing is that this sort of game is going to have a fan base that will buy it, absolutely no matter what. I got back into NBA games last year after a long hiatus from sports games. I was pleasantly surprised I actually liked 2K17 and was looking forward to getting another NBA game this year. I've already wasted my money, don't waste yours too."

76561198062186934,Recommended,577800,34978768,Posted: 15 September,all,DrawsPastTense,"The hate for this game is a shame, but is geared toward one game mode.  If you are only interested in playing mycareer, then understand that you are going to be in for a grind, or you are going to be paying extra money.  You don't have to pay extra money and can earn it, but it will take time. (update: 9/20/17)I am a big sports fan and I play all different types of sports games.  NBA 2K has been a staple since it was literally NBA 2K! Not only does NBA 2k18 closely resemble the real NBA, but it surpasses all other game makers in resembling their respective sports.In comparison to 2K17 this is a huge upgrade.  The movement is on point, the jumpshots smooth, the momentum of players' movement before going up for a shot, dunk, or layup is impressive.  The controls continue to improve year over year, and animations are motion captured from real players.  Anyone that complains about the gameplay either doesn't know anything about basketball, or is blinded by their hate for 2K because of Mycareer.99.9% of the hate for NBA 2K18 is coming from 1 game mode called mycareer.  The issue people are having is that they don't feel like they should have to earn their way to a good player, or take the shortcut and pay for one.  Paying for VC is a shortcut!  It is not meant to be the standard.  Nor do you have to pay for anything with real money in this game.  Should you be able to pay for attribute points?  I don't think so.  But, Mycareer is meant to be a competitive mode that pits real world players against real world players across the globe.  Another issue people are having is with the archetypes.  It limits your customization to certain ""type"" of baller.  This makes sense if you are creating a competitive game mode.  Otherwise, you would have 7 footers on the floor busting crazy moves and draining threes, and that would be it.  OMG what a nightmare of a game that would be.  Now there are a few things that definitely need to be addressed, but can we please keep our heads and not run for the pitchforks?  Unskippable cutscenes is one thing that should be patched so people dont go completely insane (which apparently they have).  Another is being able to view stat changes in Mycareer when using hard earned VC.  My own personal gripe is that the legends from All-time teams seem to be inconsistent with the badges they have.  Something that I have noticed might be getting overlooked for a couple of years now.Game modes:  There is something that should appeal to anyone here.  You have your regular sports sim, an RPG element in mycareer (grindy AF or microtransactions), quick games, franchises on or offline that can go on for up to 80 seasons.  You can be a GM in it's own story driven mode if you want.  You can play blacktop pickup games in 1 on 1 through 5 on 5.  You can play with almost every Legend you can dream of!  A couple are missing for their own reasons, but the shear volume of past players is unmatched by any sports title to date.  My favorite way to play is with a couple friends locally in our own fantasy  league with Legends.  This game gives you the ability to customize your own league in any way you want.  There is so many aspects in regards to game modes this paragraph could go on for too long.  I am giddy with excitement with what this game has to offer.Microtransactions:  This is a big hot button item for this game.  However, I fail to see how this is much different than most other games now, except the fact that YOU CAN EARN VC in game while playing in what seems like any mode.  Sure you can buy VC to make your mycareer player better faster, or buy packs for the myteam mode to unlock better players faster.  Or you can just earn it, and improve your ingame character as you go.  This game would be a ruined mess if everyone could just do whatever the hell they wanted.  IMO the part that is dissapointing here, is that you can buy your way to a good player with real money.  I feel like that aspect should be earned through and through.  But is there content enough here to warrant the price tag?  Absolutely.How does it run on PC?  ..... flawless!  I have a pretty advanced rig that you can see in my profile if you so choose.  But this is a game that has unbelievably well detailed graphics, lighting, and animation and for it to never dip below 60 fps for even one moment while playing is something most games don't achieve.  I haven't run into any bugs so far.  I also play on an ultra-wide monitor.  I can't express enough how great it looks, and how appreciative I am that it is supported.Online:  This has been the achilles heal for this franchise for some time.  Server issues, sputtering, disconnects, and things of that nature.  At this point I haven't had any issues with the game.DO NOT listen to the negativity.  It seems as if a classic steam mob mentality has taken over this game. If you are a fan of the sport, are interested in the sport, or just like video games.  You can't go wrong here.  We need our PC community to start supporting sports titles on PC.  The fact that 2K rolls it out, and does it with such quality, makes me even more annoyed at the ridiculousness of some of the steam reviews due to the anger circulating around one mode.  Get it together poeple!  By far the best sports title I have played to date.UPDATE:  As the negative reviews keep pouring in I started to notice that most of you do not know that the game literally offers so much content without the need to pay above the price tag that is getting overlooked.  For example, if you want to create a player and have complete control over his stats... you can!  Just not in the competitive mycareer mode.  Go to the create a player in options and then put him on whatever team you want and start a mygm or myleague with that team.  You can literally change whatever you want as you go.  All of the content is available without VC in every other mode except Myteam and Mycareer..  If  you don't like the grind, then just play the other modes.  It is not locked behind microtransactions or anything like that.  Also, as you play in the other modes guess what you can be earning while you do so?  VC.  So if you want to then give it another go in mycareer then you have a head start with the VC you earned while having fun in myleague or mygm.  Hope that helps many of you."

Gameplay has improved alot, dribbling is more skill based now instead on just left-righting and spaming momentum crossovers. I just hope they add some sort of anti cheat next year, but that won't happen, unfortunately.I would still recommend this game desipite the fact that it will be overrun by cheaters in a few months."

76561198087364090,Recommended,577800,35454910,Posted: 3 October,all,[BRG] Vice,"I will start this off by giving you a bit of my background with basketball video games. I've played the NBA 2K series since 2K6 (Shaq cover). Before that I played NBA Live all the way back to NBA Live 95. So I've bought and played a basketball game every year for 22 years.Now to my actual review; 2K18 is beautiful and the mechanics are on point. I'll admit 2K17 was a disaster, they tried to change too much and went too far. This year they've corrected all of that and improved the core of the game. The dribbling, the lateral movement, the AI IQ, etc. is absolutely great this year. This is hands down the best product they've put out to date.I'm someone who likes to manipulate the sliders to give myself the most realistic experience as possible, I don't like shooting over 50-60% in a game or scoring 140 because it's just simply not very realistic. With that said, I haven't had to tweak many sliders this year, the game is feeling great out of the box, the shooting percentages are still a little high but outside of that it's very impressive.As you may have guessed by now, I'm someone who actually likes to play the core game, I don't play MyCareer. I typically stick to MyLeague or MyGM. Neither of these modes require VC so I don't have the VC issues that most of the other players posting reviews have. In fact before I stopped playing 2K17 I had about 450,000 VC just because I never had a reason to spend them.In conclusion, if you're a basketball fan and want to play realistic basketball then the game works absolutely amazing and there are about 10 other modes to play besides MyCareer. But if you're a MyCareer fan, then maybe wait a bit and see if 2K fixes their issues with that mode, I don't play it but obviously there's issues if it's received this many negative reviews. I wish people would judge the game as a whole instead of 1 out of 10 game modes, but there's nothing I can do about that. 100% Recommend."

You simply can not upgrade the attributes of your MyPlayer without purchasing VC (Virtual Currency) from the 2K store in game.  It is nearly impossible to acquire VC without paying real money to this awful company.  Oh, and you want a haircut for your MyPlayer, well that'll cost -Insert insane price of VC here-!  On top of that, the game won't let you preview the haircut on your player.Another popular game mode, MyTeam, has also taken a plunge.  This mode is ridden with bugs.  You have the option to play online multiplayer, or just single player challenges/games.  If you want to play online, good luck, you will be facing a team with the best of the best cards because 90% of people playing this game are hackers.  If you want to play singleplayer, have fun spending countless hours playing through games just for laughable upgrades to your team.  Once again, in this mode, you have the option to use VC.  You can use VC on card packs in this mode, and get great players from those packs.  So in the end you can be 1. Person who plays Singleplayer and has a laughable team, 2. Have a squad of god players because you spent real money on the game.2K is turning into EA, they may be worse than EA actually.  2K18 is an absolute joke right now, and I don't think it will get better anytime soon because the work ethic of the developers at 2K is nonexistent.  I am extremely disappointed with this game and I am sure the majority of the community is as well."

76561198041291464,Recommended,577800,35257536,Posted: 28 September,all,Blackout,"So, a big controversial year for 2k.Gameplay is good, imho the best till now, still has some flaws like the shot release on jumpers but damn it's fun to play even vs AI. Also the release timing on layups introduced this year is awesome when you get used to it.The main problem is that 2k has been greedy AF. Grind is the biggest till now, which is not acceptable for a game i should want and can change every year to have te most up to date release. So that huge grind pushes you time after time day by day to buy VC which i can't reccomand because it destroys the videogame business (we aren't talking about a f2p this is a 60 bucks game). Hopefully we will see changes like with the haircut prices.Also the story in my career is C R A P and again they need to add a patch to make you skip those stupid cutscenes.This frustration players expirienced brought them to over-criticize aspects of the game that actually are not broken (like the before mentioned layup release timing)I still reccomand this game because the gameplay is way to good to stay away from it. Just know that you'll have to grind for VC if you wan't to go 99 ovr in my career, which isn't always even worth becaus for example you don't need to max out your post offence on a sharpshooting guard).So if you are a basketball fan i reccomend you this game. Buy it, LEARN it, play it enjoy it and take your time with it don't obsess yourself about vc."

First off, just as any other nba2k game, it's designed to extract the most money out of you in subsitute of your personal time. So when I see people complain about the money hungry aspect of the vc, I say don't spend the money and just grind it out like the rest of us that actually do. Second, I would have to say that the new MyPlayer mode is my favorite one to date hands down! Only thing I don't care for is that my name is automatically ""DJ"". Third, The gameplay and mechanisms are much more realistic then ever before. It will take a little getting used to from the straight turbo boost running along the baseline dunk. The graphics are even better, but I guess that will depend on your pc setup and tv. Overall the game is designed to get money out of you because people are impatient and want instant gratification.

Lastly MyGM is way better this year.Bad Stuff---The game wants you to pay for vc really bad, its kinda dumb and if you dont get some vc at the start it will be super rough until you hit 70 overall, and that can take a while"

,Recommended,577800,34988309,Posted: 15 September,all,morph113,"Pretty good so far. I like the storyline better this time around. Sure it's not realistic but it's something different. We've already had these unknown rookie got drafted storylines, so it's something else for a change. I really like the implementation of the neighborhood, mypark and myplayer. So many bad reviews, yet everyone keeps playing. But NBA 2K games always had bad reviews on Steam so that's nothing new.The graphics are as good as always. Performance is fine on my laptop, just like last year. The gameplay feels smooth and the animations are great. I haven't encountered any glitches or crashes yet. Overally I'd say it's an improvement from 2k17 which was the best one so far, so the have topped themselfes once again.The game of course isn't without flaws. I don't mind having to pay VC for hairstyles at the barbershop, but not being able to preview the hairstyle or facial hair on your character before buying is pretty weak. Also that you don't get to keep a hairstyle once you bought it, you need to pay again each time you change your hair."

,Recommended,577800,34965071,Posted: 14 September,all,Kozzy-New Curb Your Enthusiasm!,"First off let me say this, there are microtransactions once again, they have been here for years and once again are here. They are not needed!! Why on earth do they keep putting these in these sports games, it is so silly. I am still having alot of fun with the game though in My Team and My Career, I have yet to spend a penny on VC and I never will, with that said there is still alot of fun to be had. my My career player is averaging over 20 points a game and doing really well, so no you don't need ot spend money on VC but that does not take away from the fact that they should not be in the game. STOP IT 2k! The gameplay is improved this year from  moment to moment so that makes the micros even more of a slap in the face, let the gameplay shine!Now to the rest of my review, this is more awesome Basketball from 2k, there is a reason they are the best in all of sports gaming! Realistic, authentic gameplay, great graphics and tons of content. The animations are better, The game runs very well, ball handling and movement feels better, My Career seems better already and it is a blast to play, if you love basketball and don't mind a steep learning curve, pick it up!I have the game maxed out on Ultra (only thing off is Bloom as I dislike it). Playing at 1080p with a 1060, i5 for cpu and 8gb of ram (windows 10 and the latest nvidia driver).The gameplay and controls in general are all a good deal better than last year, some things some people might not notice right away, but that play a big role in good gameplay. The post game for the big men is much better, moving the characters around is smoother and doesn't feel as clunky as past years (feels like I have more freedom).The only negative I have is the microtransactions, no need for those imo. They don't really effect me to much as each year I always upgrade my player in my career to 90 rating without spending a penny. But still, there is no reason for them to be in the game."

Some great additions to MyLeague this year -- which is way more fun than MyCareer anyway in my opinion.Many people act like MyCareer is the only game mode, and I don't think I'll even try it this year.The only issue for me is the Create A Player option, which is based off a new system. It shows promise, but they released it half-baked with major flaws, which 2k is supposedly going to fix. If they fix that, this basketball game will be GREAT."
,Recommended,577800,35355256,Posted: 30 September,all,Barnameji,"This game has received good criticism. Yes, the fact that you cannot skip cutscenes, and that there are an absurd amount of microtransactions are major negatives. I completely agree with that, and do not wish to support it.However, despite that, I still must recommend it. It seems to me that people aren't discussing the gameplay enough.As a long time 2K player, I am really enjoying the new animations and gameplay mechanics added. I love the new UI and menu systems compared to 2k17, and I am ecstatic that they finally added a feature that removes duplicate players when doing a MyLeague fantasy draft. In fact, even though you can't skip cutscenes it seems to me you can make it into the NBA even faster than any of the other 2K games.All I can say is: Expect to grind or pay to win if you want to to do MyCareer. I understand that for some, this is not an option. However, if you can get past that hangup or look to other modes this really is a great game."
,Recommended,577800,34994975,Posted: 16 September,all,A$AP Glocky,"Now this is a new experience. I have played NBA 2k15, 2k16 and 2k17 and I have to say, that this one already blows out them all by far.Let's begin with the story: It's really fleshed out. Not Cutscene-Game-Cutscene-Game for 8-10 Games and then it's finished, no. You get objectives (which mostly just consist of ""go to your agent"" or ""go to the new store you just unlocked"", but there are objectives), cutscenes after most games and most times you go to the training facility (even though I can see that annoying most people who just want to grind for park) and they are mostly funny and somewhat interesting. A problem I had was that you won't be drafted anymore and rather have to choose your team, but that's not too bad.  You interact with many teammates, staff members and enemies, which let's the league really come to live. Also new in this one: you can actually take part in the shootaround before the game. You don't have to though, as you can just skip it.  All in all, it's a really solid career mode that lets you feel as if you are a player in the NBA.Now let's go to the Hubworld, ""the Neighbourhood"". It's really great. Like really great. You see all these other players walking around, playing at the dunk off (yes, there is a dunk contest in there all time now, even though it's replayability is somewhat questionable for the sole reason of the small selection of dunks, 4 that is), the 3pt contest, king of the court (a 1v1 mode to 3 points with 1's and 2's, where you have to win as many games in a row as possible), the park (aka the playground) and so on. Everybody is walking around in different gear, looking for mates, trying all the new modes out and so on. Every game mode like park and Pro-Am are now places to go. There even is a gym where you can train at and get boosts, if you want to do so.Upgrading now works a bit differently. First off, it's now called the ""Road to 99"", and is the ranking system, where you get new unlockes every 5 or so overall-raises. You unlock Road to 99 points, which are the upgrade points, by training and playing and you unlock badges by doing so as well. For the Upgrades, you have to just play and for the badges you have to do specific things, for example dribble moves to finish for ankle breaker. I really like it, because you don't have to do the same thing over and over and over again, just to get one single upgrade. You also can also train specifically for one badge at your team's training facility. Upgrading takes its while, but you will get there. Not to fast and not to slow in my opinion.Park and Pro-am: The new park design is very nice, really resembles a real park. There are not enough courts sometimes, but you just have to go into your apartement or the training facility and it should change. But otherwise nothing has really changed, besides some good server improvements (even though there still is a bit of lag). The pro-am really still is the same, nothing has changed much, but it didn't have to. There are still cheaters though.MyTeam: Has to offer some new and good modes, like Pack and Play, a new and refined Online mode with salary caps and season-like gameplay and a lot (900+) singleplayer challenges. It offers you long term gameplay, and by longterm I mean years.And now to the most important thing: GAMEPLAY. The Gameplay is beyond fantastic. Everything feels SO SMOOTH. It's sometimes as if you are watching real basketball, especially in the park.Defending became way harder but it feels way better. They changed the layup-animations, you won't do the same layup from different positions now over and over again like last year, and you won't do the same up and under or spin move or... all the time. You like circus shots? Then you can get that as a package. You want to keep it simple? Then take that as a package. Shooting feels really great as well, especially with the new shot meter besides your head. Everything looks so good and feels so good, I just don't want to stop playing because I don't want to stop looking at this game.This pretty much sums up my experience until now, and I'd rate it a 9.5/10 compared to other sportsgames I have played this far.TL;DR:+gameplay,graphics,sound,animations,design,modes,new upgrading style-lag,cheaters,upgrades quite expensive (full character to 85 costs 40€)"

I have complaints about MyCareer (UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES, FROM HELL'S HEART I STAB AT THEE!), but MyTeam is fire.There are over 900 single player MyTeam challenges immediately available, not including weekly/special challenges. This is a far cry from 2k17, in which there were roughly 65 of the same.In terms of gameplay, the mechanics of driving to the basket are more fluid. Defense also feels more true to life, and less ""I am glued to my opponent."""

,Recommended,577800,34989752,Posted: 16 September,all,Orang_Pendek,"I jumped to 2K18 straight from 2K16. The accusations of microtransaction hell I see in the reviews are just false. Nothing changed in that regard. I mean, it's the same system as in NBA 2K16 but in a different user interface. Now, you need to go to a tattoo parlor in The Neighborhood to buy a tattoo for VC, instead of just going to the myplayer store through the menu.The only thing that got under the microtransactions is the haircut: the majority of hairstyles are sold for VC at the barbershop. But it's all cheap, like a one rookie bench-sitting game cheap (e.g. you get around 800 VC for the very first games, and the beard is about 200 VC). There is no pay-wall anywhere, everything is bound to natural progression. Just play the goddamn game!In terms of gameplay and presentation, absolutely everything is much better than NBA 2K16. I don't really give a $hit about online multiplayer, but for single-player or couch, offline multiplayer with your friends it's a beautiful basketball game. But if you're looking into a flawless online multiplayer experience, you're clearly new to this thing or simply delusional, since 2K Games is notorious for providing poor online multiplayer experience. People are still buying their games and then b1tch about it on the official forums while the publisher is counting their profits, and the same thing has been going on for years. I don't really know what pople were expecting in terms of online experience this year. It's the same company, why would they care to put more money into network engineering if you're paying anyways? You can only boycott the whole thing or pay for the Live franchise as a competitor to make an impact. B1tching on the Internet doesn't cut it where money talks.The physics of the players and the ball feels much more natural, the player-to-player contact is way better: no more feeling like driving a truck down the court, or players sticking to each other like glue. It all feels like you're actually controlling your player all the way, and not just driving him between the animation scripts.MyCareer still has all the cheese in the world to it, but it's not nearly as bad as Spike Lee's or last year's implementations. The cutscenes are ok, but what drives me nuts is the mini-cutscenes in The Neighborhood when you go to the stores. It's about 10 seconds of your character slowly walking into a store and looking at the things, same for exiting the store. That is completely unnecessary and kind of ruins the natural pace. And moving around The Neighborhood is too slow.Overall, this game is a big improvement over NBA 2K16. While 2K17 was virtually identical to 2K16, I hold 2K16 as the golden standard of the recent years (to me, it was the best since 2K12). And there are improvements in every aspect of the game. The microtransactions would bother you only if you're a spoiled brat who wants it alll NOW!!! But if you want to grow your MyPlayer and progress with time, over a couple seasons, you're good, trust me. Play the game and earn VC, it's just as simple as that. And it's more enjoyable even at the 63 overall rating as a rookie than it was in 2K16 due to the better physics.I've given 2K a lot of $hit for their constant milking of the franchise, but this time, they've done a really good job and my hat is off to them. It's a great basketball game.[ UPDATE ]  (quoting my reply from a forum discussion)Pay-to-win accusations are simply false. I stated it in my review, and I'll repeat it. The microtransactions are absolutely the same as they were back in 2015 (2K16) and even back in 2013 with 2K14 on PS4. The only difference is HOW you make purchases in-game (go to vendors in The Neighborhood instead of just switching in the menu). And you have to buy haircuts/facial hairstyles from the barbershop, but those are really cheap.The majority of the reviews cry ""wolf"" when there's none, the paywalls of pay-to-win that is. You don't have to pay to win, you can earn VC just as you did before in every other NBA 2K, you get paid for both MyCareer matches, all the online matches, all the singleplayer exhibition matches, MyGM, etc... Those who whine about paywalls are lying and just want to have a superstar right away that dunks 720 under both legs from the FT line over the whole team. That's why you have a whole fckng career mode to progress over the seasons. And usually, by the end of the first season, you get decent play-time and make on-court impact even on the Hall-of-Fame difficulty.That's why you have progression modes in games. You don't get everything. In every RPG game, for example, you start with rags and progress to riches. And you have to pay for stuff in the in-game stores, whether it has a microtransaction option for a ""shortcut"" or you go the native way and pay in the in-game currency that you earn while playing it. There's nothing new.It would be outrageous if 2K wouldn't let people earn skillpoints/VC and only made it available to purchase via microtransactions. But they didn't. Nothing has changed. Only the game got a lot better. People need to have a reality check and learn to play the game. Want to play as a superstar? Play quick matches and lock yourself on a player, simple as that. Don't play a career mode and complain that you have to earn your stuff."

That being said I don't like the high usage of VC in this years gameplay, taking money to get a haircut without knowing what it will look like seems like a careless move from 2K. The major problem I have with this years 2K is the fact that you can't see your attributes when you are upgrading your myplayer, another thing I dislike about this years 2K is the fact that you can't skip the cutscenes. The Gameplay is much better than last years, including the addition of smoother ball control and a much better defensive and triple-threat experience. The player customization seems bad so I don't know how the roster creators feel about it.

The visuals are amazing and the animations are on point.I do have a high end PC, so just customize the settings to where your running at least 60 frames for your rig."
,Recommended,577800,35006375,Posted: 16 September,all,Flatline,"This will be a ""rolling review"", as in I will update it throughout the year as I'm a pretty big 2k fan.Firstly there are some isses with MyCareer, it mostly centers around the difficulty of making shots however. I'm a playmaker/sharpshooter, and yet on wide open shots with good release I seem to miss more oft' than not. in fact that only wide open shots I've made were with green release.With that being said:Myleague is better.I play Myleague the most, as I like to ♥♥♥♥ around with simulations. I think the addition of 2way contracts along with the graph tool's increadibly useful for building your team.I've only simmed a season, so this will be updated in the future.The gameplay's better.Green releases are very hard to get, unless you know the shot (ie curry's) but you can get them even when smothered now.It's more fluid; you no longer have to worry about getting stuck in animations.You don't have to aim your shot anymore (I think).MyTeam's better.. sortof.The amount of rare players, or even good players you get per box's now significantly limited (ie opened 20 packs but recieved no ruby players). However supermax, and schedule appear to be cool new features. We'll have to see how they progress this.I don't play MyGM so.I'd give it a 7.5/10 at the present.It suffers from crashing, odd shot settings in MyCareer (and only my career. in play now, myleague and myteam the shot settings're fine)."

I also haven't had any issues with the servers or with optimization. Still people will find something to ♥♥♥♥♥ about. If you liked the previous games than you'll enjoy this because its a great improvement.

,Recommended,577800,35029200,Posted: 17 September,all,johnny.killstring,"I've owned every NBA 2K game thus far... which makes me feel old, but that's besides the point. The point, as it were, is whether or not I enjoy this game, and think it might be worth someone else's time.For my part, I typically play GM mode, with some dabbling in MyPlayer to see if the story hooks me (the only one that did it for me was 2K16's Spike Lee Joint - the rest of the MyPlayer stories never held my interest), and that's my jam. I don't play online, street mode, MyTeam, whatever; not really my thing. Haven't done multiplayer of any sort since I graduated university.I'm only 9ish hours in, but I've been quite happy with the game.My roomates once asked if there was any basketball in my basketball game, to which I replied that I approach the series like a tactical RPG; I'm leveling up my squad right now. Deck-building, if you will. The games proper are like the battles in an RPG, and a place to test out my builds. I do also enjoy the basketball part of the game as well, but I mostly play it as a sim.The sim parts are stronge than they've ever been.I rather liked the story in MyGM - it's the first time that I genuinley felt like I needed to think about my actions as regards the owners, talking to the press, etc. It's good! As far as the basketball proper goes, I'm really enjoying it so far; the AI seems to be nicely refined, and the shot meter just mainstreams a feature that's been optional in years past, that I always keep turned on.Nothing revolutionary, but the parts of the game that I enjoy are more robust than ever. I nearly gave this year a pass due to the negative reviews here, then I read them, and realized that they weren't talking about anything that would affect my experience with the game.I do agree that it's kind of jerky to ask someone to choose between non-basic hairstyles and leveling up their skills. That stuff should be part of the character creator, and smacks of a cash grab. But ultimately, it hasn't done much to affect my enjoyment of the game.Recommended for:Sports sim enthusiastsPeople who enjoy a smooth 5-on-5 basketball gameRPG players curious about sports gamesNot reccomended for:People who are very invested in MyPlayer, but averse to microtransactions (which have always been a big part of that mode, but seem a bit stronger this year)Someone looking for an arcade experiencePeople averse to great songs with Spanish lyrics in their gamePeople looking to play with a keyboard and mouse"

Sure there are some negative aspects such as grinding VC but overall its still fun and competitive against the AI. Most the complaints are about VC... But you dont have to buy VC you just have to grind, even so if you put in $5 worth you can get at least 65-67 ovr without playing an NBA game.One complaint I have is driving to the basket though, if your stamina is low you will always go for a layup... i think the stamina bar needs to be tweaked... in 2k17 you can sprint and dunk to the basket no problem... 2k18 you have to not sprint then when closer sprint in order to dunk."

,Recommended,577800,35052778,Posted: 18 September,all,Boss Sauce,"tl;dr - Most of the problems are in MyCareer, and they aren't that bad. If you are like me and just love playing a well-made game about basketball in Play Now or MyLeague, this is a gem.Ok, I see the hate, and most of it is legit. Yes, 2k is greedy, put microtransactions in everything in MyCareer, and there are some bugs. HOWEVER (and this is why I recommend it), the gameplay is tight (aside from bugs which I'm sure will be fixed), and the other modes such as MyLeague (which is what I mainly play) and MyGM are enhanced with new features, the movement is good, you don't have the canned dribble-pick up animations, which means when you mess up on a dribble-drive you straight up lose the ball or you make zero progress, as it should be. Also, 2k has finally made players make mistakes. Passes go out of bounds, trying to save your possesion after a failed play is properly hectic, and players who suck at making layups rarely make layups. It seriously matters whether you are using an 90 overall vs a 70, and you have to be smarter when using bad players. I don't much like the new shot meter, but I will probably turn it off anyways. Its more satisfying to learn your teams shooting style and focus on the animation rather than a meter. Also, if you turn off your wifi for a sec and create an offline MyCareer, you can play with them in games and upgrade using skill points from games instead of VC. You can't do animations or customization in offline MC mode, but if you hate the microtransactions that much you have another option. If you're looking for a good basketball game to get your fix before the season starts in 29(!) days this is the game for you"

,Recommended,577800,35299748,Posted: 29 September,all,Masquerain,"NOTE: I mainly play MyLeague and MyCareer, so this review is based on my experience with those modes.After the release, the game has received unreal criticism for several different reasons, and having put in nearly 30 hr into the game I thought I would have a general scope of how the game is like, and if I recommend it or not, so:Pros:-The MyLeague and MyGM modes have been improved significantly. Additions like the G-League, moratorium, and all My GM cutscenes and so on has made the game more entertaining, some very solid rookie classes have also been added in by the community and it makes the mode realistic and fun to play. I realized that I played a save for 4 hours and it felt like half an hour, so I would say it's really good. The ability to create and add a player mid season is a fun way to make the mode interesting.-MyCareer mode is definitely improved in several areas, the addition of the neighborhood is very colorful and dynamic, stores like Foot Locker and being able to shop through the store in-game is very fun. Being able to reach 99 overall is a good re-addition, last year it was removed. The badge grinding system makes the game interesting and makes it easier to get your badges.Endorsement deals are exciting to receive and boosts up your overall VC earnings by quite a margin. Being able to select your starting team is pretty fun and makes the mode more customizable, and your veteran team mate Shammy Wells is a colorful personality who is a knockdown shooter, so he makes it easier on the court too. Merch given by your sponsors makes the game fun and interesting. Wide variety of sponsorship deals are impressive.-Regardless of what problems may occur, the game is patchable, and problems are not unsolveable, for a while I believe the best basketball game there is will have to be 2k, considering all the sponsorships and league-wide interactions they have.Cons:There are an immense amount of cons to this game.-MyLeague: One of the simplest modes there is, there are bugs and inconsistencies in MyLeague. Sometimes, after completing a trade, and wanting to do another one, the same trade that was done before pops up again, with the same player you just traded away being on your team, and it doesnt go away no matter how many times you back out of the trade screen. With this, even though I like that its not a GSW- Cavs final every simulated year, some impossible teams like the Bulls or Hornets make the NBA finals and win it at times. Now of course, with squad improvements they definitely could in any given time, but they do it in the first year without making ANY improvements to their roster.There is also a bug that crashes your game at times when a player you are negotiating with accepts another offer, and the moratorium sysem with all the cap holds/bird rights is hard to understand for the casual player that does not know about the CBA cap rules.-MyCareer: Where to start. Definitely the most inconsistent and annoying MyCareer has ever been. The amount of VC that is needed to upgrade attributes are not immense or impossible, and VC prices are not terrible. However, the game does not only require VC for attributes, but for literally EVERYTHING. This is a triple A title and I would say that the amount of micro transaction hunger is insane. Haircuts are 100 vc and even though this is post patch, I still think its stupid to splash out 1/4 of my rookie salary on a haircut. With this, hair colors unlock at stupid overall caps like 85, and they are very basic colors, like blonde. Foot Locker has great shoes, but they are minimum 1500 VC and that is ridiculous. You have to play 5 games with a 60 overall player to get one shoe with one colorway, and it discourages the player to use the neighbourhood and shoe collecting since you have to allocate most of your VC to improve your player since you are the worst player in an NBA roster by 9 overalls at least. The cutscenes are unskippable, and even though I didn't mind it as much as some players did, the cutscenes are very corny, since your close sircle is filled with cringy characters like your best friend B Fresh, your agent Bryan, and team employees. Regarding gameplay, not only do you start as the worst NBA player in the league, you also have the most incapable teammates there is, no matter what the situation is. I started with the Lakers, so I dont know if its the case for everyone, but my team mates are averaging horrible numbers with horrible efficiency and I feel like this was made intentionally by 2K. Also, I have seen the momentum change in a game, where the opposition team went 19/23 for their shots and we lost,  just because the game wanted to show me a cutscene where my vet scolded me for trying to chat with him after a blow out we suffered. Your incapability as a player is incredibly frustrating and it took me 20 something hours of game time just to get to 65 overall without buying VC. Also, one of my main problems is the absence of rookie mode. I usually open up 2 saves, one challenging and one where I just put up insane numbers on rookie and it was my favorite thing about the game, and the absence of the rookie mode made me incredibly disappointed.Optimization issues: I have a 960 M (6 GB) card and I am forced to play the game at 1024 right now with medium settings, because I get immense amounts of screen tearing and fps drops whenever the camera shifts in game. Even though I dont expect the game to run on ultra 1920x1080, I do believe that my graphics limit shouldnt be set so low. However, the game runs super smooth on 1024.I dont have anything else to say about the game. The reason as to why I recommend this game mainly lies on the fact that its overall fun. Sadly, this is the best you can get out of a basketball video game. Even though it has its inconsistencies and huge problems, I still believe 2k18 was a very ambitious effort by 2k to really create a new and fun experience. Its nowhere near a perfect game, and I am very disappointed about a lot of things, but the grind for MyCareer helps me kill time and I like it, and the MyLeague mode is very fun and has a lot of variation so I like it too.Therefore, overall, I recommend this game, however keep in mind all the problems when you are buying it and dont hesitate to wait for patches before buying the game."

There's probably a Korean mmo esque grind in store for many of you.The goodOnce again the my gm mode that I spend 90% of my play time is largely the same as 2k16/17 nothing really ground breaking there. But the animations and feel that accompanies those animations is very well done. You can, no joke actually play defense and get around AI. And they can do it to you. It feels and looks like basketball. The shot timing and meter are alot different and it's alot better Than before. It doesn't feel like you're cheesing the game and it doesn't feel like your getting cheated. So far my stats and shooting percentages are more realistic than ever before.(I play 10 minute quarters on hall of fame). As always, if you are a solo player you HAVE to play with those sliders to get it right. It usually takes me a week of playing to get a decent challenging game but this year it already feels good. I'll tweak it more if I feel like I'm beating the AI too easily. I've played 5 full games and every one was a battle. Nice. Also no game breaking or annoying glitches have popped up yet and smooth stutter and tearing free game play. Decent port.The BadAlmost everything seems to revolve around my career and my team or general online play. This isn't exactly bad but again, this game lacks innovation on the solo player side. They really didn't do much with the broadcast team this year. There is alot of new lines in between quarters and the pre game team got some love but there is alot of recycled dialogue from the announcers from like 2 years ago. Especially the players. I don't think I've heard something new from player dialogue yet. They also decided to remove the post game snippet and the player of the game is announced part way through the 4th quarter. Whatever.Honestly, other than the atrocious dlc practices it's not that, so far. Will update as I play."

This is the most complete nba2k has been in a long time, but that's not to say that there are a lot of hiccups. Let's start with the hiccups, The my career concept is great the delivery not so much. It's plagued by microtransactions in order to increase your stats before you even play. This wouldn't be such a big deal if you started out in summer league and progressed into the season. You need atleast a 70 overall to start the game to be competitive. Lastly the cinematics need to be skippable it's frustrating when you just want to play the game, that way people who want to watch can and those who do not have a choice. Besides My career nba2k should be an instant by each mode gets better and better every year. Buy it for the package not just one mode."

I havent played since NBa2K16 on XBOX one so I was a bit hesitant to get this on PC. Not dissapointed at all. Controls are responsive and smooth (xbox one controller)Havent had any crashes. a few minor hiccups when messing with video settings. The on the court action is top notch and the lottle details they added such as players trying to get a rebound and it hitting there hands and bouncing off adds to the realism.The only issue is with VC its a cash grab and 2K has not gotten rid of it over theyears so that tells me that people are paying real moneyfor fake in game money. It really sucks as I know they are designing the game to make you want to pay that money. I refuse!!!Online - I have not played the game online so cant give impressions. Im not really into B Ball online myself. Offline play is my thing and this game fulfills that need!!

Here is the bottomline concerning the MyCareer mode. Grinding your way to a 99 overall would actually be worth the effort if it wasn't for the following reasons:1. You didn't start off like a scrub at 60 overall.2. You could actually earn a decent amount of VC like in other modes such as MyLeague and Myteam. In Mycareer mode, you get a paltry sum in comparison.3. The cost of upgrading the players attributes didn't increase to a rediculously high amount. After you reach six to seven bars, the cost jumps from around 800 VC to well over 2,000.These are the things that makes this game 100% pay to win. There are players who are already a borderline 90 overall already for no other reason, or because they hacked their way to a 99 overall with unlimited VC. Couple this with the fact that a new game is released every single year, and it makes the effort in grinding your way to a 99 overall pointless, which at this rate will take at least six months. Unless you play Myleage or Myteam modes to get real VC, lots of people are not going to have to time to sit here for hours on end per day trying, because we have a life.I already coughed up the extra money for VC to upgrade my player to a half decent 78 overall. Now, instead of grinding my way to an 80 or 90 in Mycareer, I'm basically forced to play other modes I don't really care too much for just to get a decent amount of VC. Its beyond ridiculous, and if this is not changed in 2K19, I'm done. I only reccomand this game for those who don't play a lot of Mycareer mode. For those who play mainly Mycareer however, I would probably stay away or atleast wait until the price drops, because you WILL be spending the extra money to get a decent rating."

The game is so good that EA has cancelled their game several years in a row. I think people are taking the game for granted. If you think the grass is greener then go play live. Personally, I was never really a fan of my player/career anyway. I'd much rather play with current teams. Aside from the excellent gameplay, the game runs wonderfully on my Gtx 1070. I can max game settings at 1440p and get well over 100 fps. If you enjoy hoops, buy this game!I have 1 gripe so far. I was in the 3rd qtr of my first game and I got kicked to desktop.

I went with red. The meter glows green when you hit it perfect, so the contrast is nice.The best thing about this year's edition is how deep the myPlayer experience is.They revamped how you rank skills up, which I really appreciate. When you put points in 3PT it levels all of the 3PT categories. I.E. 3PT off dribble, open, contested, etc.Another great feature is the choice of the player you create. When you build him, you can choose two skills, a primary and secondary. It is important which you choose and in what order, because your primary skill gives your badges the ability to be gold. I.E. I went with 3PT and Defense, so my myPlayer is labeled as a two-way sharpshooter. My gold badges are all in 3PT and all of my defensive badges are in silver.It is also really easy to level your badges in this year, as whatever you do in practice, in games, and online go towards your ""badge points"". I.E. Alley-oops and the LOB city badge. I remember in last year's version that badge had you throwing like 250 alley-oops in a season, which is crazy talk.Visually, a huge upgrade over last year's. The hair and eyes are extremely well done, and player movement is even more accurate. Bigs run more like bigs and the same goes for guards.I don't know what people are really complaining about. Maybe the price? I can understand, just because games are generally expensive. But really, if you're asking is this better than 2k17? Yes, it is. Much better.It's not just the game you're paying for. 2k is one of the companies that I trust to put out a good product, because since 2k1 with allen iverson they have cared about their consumer base and put out a thrilling game every year. This isn't EAsports. I know that throughout the year there will be roster updates and patches.It's worth it. Go buy it. Friend me and we can play some pro-am's."

Yes, It's a bit of a grind. But you make VC doing literally everything in the game. It honestly doesn't take that long compaired to an MMO. If you want an all-star level player day one, buy the VC, if you want to play a very enjoyable my career and grind your way to the top you can do that as well. I've played for 66 hours so far, not a ton. I've not bought any VC and I'm an 87 overall. Not that bad of a grind if you ask me and the improvements they have made to the gameplay are nice. Feels much less klunky. Shot meter is a little faster so you really need to watch you animation que's to get the green releases. All in all 8/10 and one of the better 2k titles thus far."

This game i would refund to get my 180 NZD back if i could, Absalutely a waste of time and money yet i still play it, why you ask? because if you remove the network errors,ping delays/delay when moving on the park, change the price of items and do a bit of bug fixing it may be one of the best nba games ever.Now look not many people like the fact that you have to buy the game and then spend money on your character, but i wouldnt mind that at all if there was no issues.As a PC player i expect, at least from a AAA game developer that the game would not have constant network issues, especially when it is basically saying 'our servers are good, its just your internet' when i have the best avalible internet in the southern hemisphere.So overall, i give it a 5.5/10 with the catchphrase ""If you have money, your a better player"" and im just going to say, maybe wait a bit before you buy it as currently in this state, its just more of a money grab than a actual game, it needs allot of work and for the issues to be fixed. After that it will be a really enjoyable game."

Im still on 63 rating on lowest difficulty. My shot arent falling either, I get around 700-900 vc per game. Nothing is free in this game if u want to be good or great you just need to GRIND. The problem with us Players is we always want an easy way. Its fine if u have money to spare if not then Grind urself to be good, quit complaning about everything. ^_^ hahaha Even Pro players Grind to elavate there game, how much more to us not a pro player. we should grind 2X or 5x just to be great or even good. So just a friendly advice, if u have the time to complain why not use that time to grind. 20mins u get 900vc x5 games thats around 4500VC x 7days if u play everyday? 31,500 VC u get to max ur lay up or ballhandling."

Only thing that you can pay to win is how fast you earn VC (even though you can earn VC IN GAME)Been playing against other players since i launched it and have not ran across a hacker once considering i've maintained a very big positive ratio on wins-losses.It's worth a buy.

I'm not a huge fan of it, but as a whole I feel the game is an overall improvement over the previous. Gameplay feels much more fluid with changes to the dribbling and shooting mechanics, new post play mechanics can make playing a big man really challenging and rewarding this time around, and the story is pretty solid, the humor can sometimes come off at cringy or just not hit it's mark, but in this edition I really get immersed, and feel like I'm more apart of the actual NBA than in previous titles. One aspect which I really enjoy is the new leveling and badge system, in previous installments you had to specially head to the gym and grind out on either drills or the repetitive vertical trainer, this time around the game levels you up by just playing games, and depending on how well you do, and your play style you earn different rewards and badges. In conclusion. If you've enjoyed the previous installments as i have, and have some patience with the pay barrier, I believe you'll find there is a lot to love about this game."

Heres Why:-The neighborhood intergrates all the different modes and cratively masks the loading screens simular to the way the division does that upon entering the base of operations.-Stats and Aestetics are tied to VC.  Most poeple hate this, but I believe its gives a kind of RPG feel to the game.  It also preventws that 1% vs 99% gap from forming too quickly (essentially killing the game.)  In years pass the youtubers would get the game early, the die hards would hae it day one, and the nomal folks have to wait an extra day to payday.  Sadly that was enough time to make a diference between a 60 rating and a 92.  which means that your already shut out of my park, online quick play modes (Unless you spend the money.)  This year there is more need for a gring, which in theroy allows everyone to gradually rank up together, giving the game more legs, (because we all know that the PC community is the first one to die for this game.)-Lastly, what people say about the vc earning is just untrue.  I think 2k fairly dishes out vc for various activities in the game.This time around Im hoping that 2k is trying to tell us that its about the journey not the destination, rathan its about the cash or you'll be trash."

It rewards the people who like the game and want to play it and turns down the people who want to be 90 overall in a couple days without paying for VC. The only negative thing that I see are the cutscenes, but that really isn't anything to take points away from since it doesn't really affect the gameplay. Another thing is that the people who complain about the MyPark need to realize that you can't expect to win against people who have had the game for over a week now when you're just starting. Grind out until you're around 70 overall and then hit the park. It really comes down to skill over stats at that point."

I am a recent console convert (to PC) and I love it.  But, some of these reviews are really frustrating.  PC people are so used to cheap if not free games in which they can abuse a developer by giving them as little money as possible.  To see all of you complaining about micro transactions truly shows your lack of understanding about current gen games.  So if this was 15 years ago, I could understand the frustration.  You bough a game back then, and there were no updates.  No nothing after the the game you bought came out.  Any bug that was in the game, exploit, or anything else that wasn't optimal was yours to deal with for ever.  We now have games that companies constantly update during the entire life of the game, all while developing the next game.All that being said, if you want some of the crap we had to deal with 15-20 years ago then go ahead and end micro transactions.  But if you want games to continue being bigger and better, they are a totally acceptable form of revenue.  This is honestly one of the coolest NBA2k's to date, if not the best.   I have played 2k for 10 years, so I would say im somewhat experienced with what they offer.   This is one of the biggest steps forward they have taken in that time period.From the open world town, to the very smooth menus, this game checks all the boxes.  If you love basketball, and you love solid 2k gameplay with an original open world idea, this game is for you.  Money well spent."

The game is solid, and very fun to play. I played on medium without a hitch; i will update more later! Happy 2king!Very low quality for me, not sure if it's poorly optimized or my PC specs just aren't good enough. However, i played 2k17 on medium. On this one, i got mostly 25-30 fps on low with some things on medium.My specsI5-4210H @ 2.9 GHZ8 RAMNvidia GTX950"

I do like this game, but it has turned really grindy. Either that or pay money for some VC... I would rather it be really grindy though then have in game spending. oh well... Still recommend... Graphics are good, game play seems ok. story sucks. Characters suck. MyPark is just a bunch of time comsuming walking... cant skip cut scenes... which the first time is alright, but once ive already seen it once, I would like to move on... 6/10EDIT: That freeze I had is still going on.... on MyCareer wont load past 30% now and stuck.... until this is fixed i cant recommend anymore.... gonna make me start all over??? i sure hope not...EDIT: Ok.... well it seems to be going again...

I'd say its ""as good"" as last years 2K.The only major bad things about the game are...-MyPlayer is VERY grindy.-VC paywall has gotten worse-The annoying use of new Sponsors the game has. (ie. Get me some ""DUNKIN DONUTS"" we all want ""DUNKIN DONUTS"")-2ks greedy a## still hardly hands out VC (you get 50VC for a trivia question correct) oh♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥boy!-MyLeague Story isnt has no Voice so fts.-The new shoot release is annoying to get used to.But the game looks and feels better. Currently enjoying the MyPlayer Story so far. Plan on doing the same as I did for the past 2k's and not give them greedy devs any more money by buying VC and just slowly grind my way up. As always if your looking for the best multiplayer xp I would stick to console still. The PC NA crowed is still not that big."

If you don't like to spend time building your player in MyCareer, then pay the VC if you want everything easy or hack your way. (Don't blame me if you got banned though if there is such a thing for banning)2. NBA MyCareer is like an MMO, you grind those stats you want to build and just like in other MMOs, if you want to build your character faster then you have to spend VC or hack again(Not recommended).  If you're not into this, don't play the MyCareer.3. If you're a whiner and still bought the game knowing how bad the people reviewed NBA then this game is DEFINITELY not for you! Ask a refund or throw your PC right away.4. Bought the game knowing full well that NBA 2ks have VC integrated or microtransactions? Sooo.. what were you hoping for anyway?5. Not ready to spend time to build your character in MyCareer? Do you even want to play the other modes? If not, are you willing to spend $$$ for the VC? No?6. Can't play without disregarding the VC? Do you really have to spend VC to make your player stronger? Or do you just want to dress up your character and all.. are you sure you even want to play this game? You should play Sims or GTA instead.7. Don't have a controller to play the game and complaining about the keyboard controls? Why would you even play this on a keyboard?8. Poor Internet Connection? Must I even explain why you're lagging?9. FPS Drops/Crashing.. Check your RAM and Graphics Card. Need technical help? Ask/hire an expert to fix your s**t.Sooo.. other than that, I WON'T RECOMMEND the game to the clueless otherwise if you're like me who doesn't care about the VC and enjoys the game even without spending $$$ on VC, then I'll recommend this to you.I got a GTX1070, i7, 16gb RAM, 120hz Screen. And no, I'm not experiencing any crashes or FPS Drops.You're not sure if your specs will play the NBA 2k18? You can also GOOGLE and compare your spec to the recommended specs of NBA 2k18. Blame your ignorance for not checking firsthand before buying."

,Recommended,577800,35025494,Posted: 17 September,all,Americelt,"Very frustrating as it seems there is no reason to making or missing shots when you play online against another person. It will even just perform random functions that you are not pressing when you play online. The MyCareer option is also trash, face scan looks nothing like me, and you hardly get to play basketball. Luckily, you can create a player to play a season with in the MyLeague option. Playing online is still fun here and there and the MyLeague is a lot of fun.I've been getting a decent amount of play out of it so I think by the time the NBA season is over I will definitely have played my $60 worth."

Just like many other player said, 2K have confusing setting about thier game experience, firstly fixing the bug cutting down their profit and still many bugs havent been fixed but continously make players fuched, let alone play against HoF MyCareer GSW. HoF in MyCareer must be hardest contest in basketball game history, rigidly lower your teammates' perfomance (which makes them look like absolutely rookie,Leonard catch-power pass to audience when you require a hand-to-hand pass), whereas GSW's 3-PT% literaly never goes down under 50 every game. I dont think they can achieve this in reality.Although GSW may be the best team ever but not so difficult to beat down with 50+30 center or 40+15+10 SF. Hardly have any chance to win with <10 lead at the beginning of the 4th querter."

Do whatever you exletive you want.*I'm just going to thumbs up cuz everyone be red.*If this is too long to read and you have no time, wait for the next cutscene. You will have more than enough time then.*(Expletive means something else) ;pPros:- I like basketball.- I like to play games.- Updated NBA rosters.- Nice graphics.- A good couch multiplayer sports game.- Play Now ain't so bad.- Controls are not as bad.- The struggle is real playing as a rookie 60 overall but doing aight.- You can play against other people and show your skills or how much money you spent... ""wut still on the Pros section bruh.""- I like basketball... ""wait I already said that"".- I want to like this game, but it is hard.Cons:- Instead of ""git gud"", it is ""git money. buy vc. then look gud.""- Can't skip cutscenes.- Could have had a better story script, but not really that bad. (Don't care much for it)- Too much of a grind for casual people.""But 27 hours on record when the game hasn't been out for two days. Ninja you fo real? Casual my russ""- It feels like an MMORPG that you keep grinding, but you dont go to other locations or change sceneries.- This is just so repetitive. (Ninja dis is a sports game wut u expect.)- If you want to own people and do well, you gotta go break the piggy bank. (My Career, etc.)- To show how much money you and others spent on top of buying the full game, go to My Career.- Too much of a money grab of a game to enjoy most modes.- Opening the game cost VC (Not really). But everything you want to do with your player cost VC.- I already bought this game and played more than two hours, so I cannot return it.This is really not that bad of a game if you will just play the basic Play Now mode to play couch multiplayer with your siblings and with friends. (Sike I ain't got no friends.)However, let us be real, most of us bought this for the My Career to enjoy playing a character that we created and see how they perform and grow in the NBA. To improve the player that we created, we have a choice. We can either make a new schedule for ourselves: eat,play,sleep,rinse and repeat(no need for baths); or work and earn a living, come home and then buy the vc (Time = money). Either way, we are still going to spend more money on a game that we bought full price.My Observation / My Advice:If you are someone that really wants to keep playing this game, go to work. Come home. Buy VC. This game is pay to win. If you grind for hours, you barely make a few thousand vcs.If you like grinding and you are making money playing this game (streamer, youtube, etc), this game is the shizznit. Buy this.If you are someone who has the money to spend on this game, go for this. Buy this.If the most you want to spend in this game is $60 and do not like to grind, be aware that price tag (I feel) is just for the Play Now mode. You can enjoy that. If you have a 9-5 job and you want to improve your player without spending your hard earned money from 9-5, the only way I believe you can get to 99 is to just sleep,work,play,rinse and repeat. You might get to 99 before 2k19 comes out.If you are someone who expects your player to ""look gud"" by practicing a lot to ""git gud"" without spending more money on this after buying the game, this is not for you. DO NOT buy this.All in all, 2k is smart to do this expletive expletive expletive expletive game this way. People will still buy this and then complain. The only thing we can really do is research and see if this game is for us. A lot of people gave this a bad review. Some people will stop playing the game. Some will not. A lot of people will see the bad reviews. A lot more are going to buy this even after seeing the bad reviews. The cycle is messed up cuz most of us are game addicts. Some are not cuz they are in denial. ;p.The only way 2k will make this cost friendly for the gamers is if people stop supporting 2k and buying the VC. But people are competitive and wants to be the best in this game. People will spend time and money to ""git gud"" on a game like this. Our world is in trouble. We could be playing in a real park and  playing bball and becoming good in real life.Anyway... explitive... I don't like this game. Then resumes playing 2k. :d*I came back to the game and the cutscene is still going... I'm done with this game."

The ""popular"" thing to do is hate on this game from what I've noticed. It also seems like people pay $60 just to play myCareer and nothing else.myCareerI personally love the myCareer mode. The story is weird and so are the characters but I'm not really interested in a story and I do wish you could skip cutscenes. People say that it takes 2-3 seasons before you have enough VC to upgrade your stats so you can ""make a lay-up"". I disagree with that. I bought the regular $60 version of the game and haven't bought an VC at all. 73 games into my first season and only 6 games played in myPark and none in ProAm I'm an 80 Overall. It was pretty difficult at first but after awhile I got the hang of things. I started out struggling to get 5 points a game and now I get 30+ a game with 8-10 rebounds and some assists. Microtransactions are part of the game but if you actually PLAY THE GAME you'll be fine.myTeamMost people leaving negative reviews have probably never even heard of this mode because it's not called myCareer. Fun little mode where you get cards that represent your players for your team. You can get legends and players from now. Play enough and you can design your own arena, jerseys, logos, etc. Tons of single player challenges to do such as domination where you start by facing every team in the league and the goal is to ""dominate"" them. Basically just play well, score points and earn enough MT to pass the challenge. I have a lot of fun with it and it's nice to play when I'm burnt out of myCareer.myGM/myLeagueI've never played the myGM mode but I've played a lot of myLeague. I usually play it 1 of 2 ways. I either play owner and try to rebuild a team and sim games to see if my team could win a championship or I player lock to one player and basically play myCareer but with free ability to upgrade my stats and make my guy the best player to ever live.Play NowI get on here. Play as the 2000-01 Lakers. Run 5 out offense. Have Shaq drive in and dunk on anyone who dares to stand in his way.tl:dr There's lots of game modes that are fun. MyCareer is a grind but fun. If you don't like grinding or paying money to be instantly a high overall, you won't like this game."
