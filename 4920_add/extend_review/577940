,Recommended,577940,35253027,Posted: 27 September,all,Daegoth Vilfariel,"One of the best FGs I've ever played. Imo It's head to head with Tekken7 (or maybe almost as good as that) regarding quality, fun and technical aspects. And then KoF14. I don't need to say sfv and mvci are plain rubbish. Sorry if u got scammed by crapcom (again).The Steam Game:* 29 chars. Full roster included here. All season chars. All costumes.* Full and I mean full customization. Unlockable colours, and features like skins, profile icons and things like those, with KI gold (nothing compared to what crapcom does with their failed and unfinished games).* Steam Version does support crossplay amon w10-xbx1 and ofc Steam. However ranked is not supported here (Ranked Steam vs Steam only, the rest of online modes are cross play supported though).* Fluid game, fights are indeed pretty dynamic and attractive. Game is also colourful and interesting, full of cool and nice effects and quite impressive during combos and special moves, visually speaking. So It's also nice to watch other ppl's matches.*Great music and ost!* Many technical mechanics, such as classical combo breakers; shadow combos, normal combos, jabs, grabs, normal moves, special moves, etc. Still have a lot to learn and practice.* Chars designs are terrific and quite different to each other. Animations are also great and you may find quite distinctive fighting styles.* Just tried online against xbx1 players which ran smooth and quite good (only 1 match was laggy and opponent left, the rest was just perfect). And then a bit of tutorial because I still have little to none idea about the game mechanics (I've been destroyed online).* I could appreciate it has many single content modes. So, if you are not into competitive matches, you'll be fine too.* Till October 4th it has a -25% discount, therefore I strongly advise you to get it asap if you are looking for a good FG (other options are ofc T7 and KoF14).* Microtransactions are just cosmetic and unlockable by just playing the game, so don't freak out if you see the ""gold"" being sold at the store or within the game. You get gold by playing anyway.* Again I'm a total newcommer to KI, never bought the w10 version but already loving this full game.* Fun fact? It supports W7 lol.Only cons? It come to Steam with huge delay (after a couple of years) and does not support ranked crosspay. Again it supports full cross play for lobbies and it's finally here. Cross play will help you to always find matches, which is the most important.Recommended for FG lovers!!KI along with Tekken7 and KoF14 are a must have imo."

Haven't had a laggy match or waited for more than a minute for a match.Lots of training and single player things to do.$30 is cheaper than $100+ buying all the characters on the Microsoft store edition.Can run this game on a toaster.Other Stuff:I haven't played Killer Instinct since the 64 version so I had a lot of learning to do since this game is 4 years old. The single player stuff helped with learning the system and made ranked matches easier to jump into. My computer isn't the best but everything runs smooth and it looks great.tl;dr - Buy the damn game!!!"
,Recommended,577940,35419262,Posted: 2 October,all,DuskHellhound,"This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.The price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.If you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players."
,Recommended,577940,35362619,Posted: 30 September,all,Karp,"Killer Instinct on the SNES was one of the first video games I ever played, so the series is special to me.I never owned an Xbox One and Windows 10 is cancer, so this was my first chance to play this game, and wow, I just can't believe how much content there is in this game.Single player: It's sad to me that in 2017 I am surprised to see fully fledged out single player modes in a fighting game, but here it is. You have Shadow Lords, two different story modes, Arcade, two different types of Survival mode, a fully featured tutorial mode that is arguably one of the best ones out there, and an extensive practice that even allows you to take some of the practice mode parameters and use it in the other 1p modes. I did a playthrough of arcade with all of the hitboxes turned on just for fun.For fans of Super Smash Bros 4, there is also a mode similar to how the Amiibos work, where you can train up a CPU character that has your fighting style and then it can earn you points towards unlocking skins, even when you're offline, when other players play through Shadow Survival mode.Multiplayer: Netcode is flawless, but be wary that the crossplay feature is only available for lobbies and exhibition, so if you want to play ranked it will be kind of dead or you'll be fighting the same guy over and over.Gameplay system: Easy to learn, hard to master. My favorite type of game. You can start the game up and within a few matches you'll have most of the basic mechanics down. Very new player friendly.Sound: The sound design in this game is amazing. Between the musical menus, the background music being truely dynamic and syncing up to the action (or lack thereof) in a match, and how guttural and viscious each attack sounds, I just can't praise it enough.Summary: Amazing fighting game, especially as a fan of the series. One of the best ones on the market right now. My only gripes are the fact that there's no f2p model so there won't get to be as many people to try it out, and the lack of the original 2 Killer Instincts that's on the XB1 version."
,Recommended,577940,35277580,Posted: 28 September,all,Vitriol,"This game comes with all of the characters (including the Shin Hisako, Kilgore, and Eagle) from each season. It plays just like the xbox or windows 10 versions. The best part is, though, is that now you can have Killer Instinct attached to Steam and not Xbox Live, meaning you do not need to connect to Xbox Live servers to load the game and all of your achievements and progress stay on steam.I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes fighting games, especially fans of mind games and mix-ups. If you like fast-paced gameplay and high offense and pressure, this game is also for you. There also some characters that excel in zoning and space control. The OST is also pretty amazing."

,Recommended,577940,35252256,Posted: 27 September,all,Sabrewylf,"KI is one of the greatest games but there are a lot of missed opportunities here.The Windows Store version is free to try. Why is this option not included here?I've owned KI since the very day it hit the Windows Store. Why should I have to pay again?Why is there this weird half-schism of playerbases?If you've never played KI before, you should definitely give it a try. If you have Windows 10 you can try the free version by going on the Windows Store. Personally I will not fork over money twice for an approximation of what could have been...The F2P model that's present on both Xbox One and the Windows Store would have been a great way to blow new life into KI via Steam. Instead both new and veteran players are left with a bad taste in their mouth. New players because for some reason their platform is the only one which -needs- payment, and veterans because for some reason Steam is the only platform for which there is no cross-buy.Andmy PS4 arcade stick still doesn't work on either version, despite Iron Galaxy claiming that the Store version supports DInput. I've had more success on Steam using Big Picture mode.But dude, KI is great so you better try it one way or another."

Hundreds of games from  Akatsuki Blitzkampf to Verdict Guilty. The mechanics, control graphic design, music - all top marks. Best Big Trouble in Little China Reference. Has a playable Battletoad. A++.What does the Steam version bring? Whhheell, lookie here:*All characters and DLC unlocked from the start.*Near as I can tell impeccable netplay. Maybe the smoothest and most responsive to date. I can combo break the same frame I would be able to against a practice dummy online without having to practice in simulated lag.*You no longer have to have your network setup with Toredo and a firewall on at all times and connecting to games is a snap with Steam integration.*Supports more controllers since it's not locked to D-input anymore.*Smoother framerate, no screen tearing (this matters for me at least).*Able to capture and stream the game easily. The Win10 version gave me a lot of trouble with this.*Costs overall WAY less than what I shelled out for the definite edition and add-on stuff. Currently $30.*Bullet points are typographically unnecessary in a short form reviewJust know that this is the definitive version of this game, and if you play fighting games with any frequency it is completely necessary to own. Rev up that Turbo Bike and get ready to eat some flaming cat guardians - K.I. has officially come to the PC and it's bad, mad and crazy!"
,Recommended,577940,35414732,Posted: 2 October,all,Valentine Meikin,"When Killer Instinct came to XBOX One, it was considered one exclusive too many by fans of the franchise.When it came to Windows 10, people complained about the rampant microtransactions.Now, it's so much better, for several reasons.Firstly, It's on Steam, which has several benefits over XBOX Live for Windows.Secondly, Any items which were outright 'paid content' are included.Thirdly, some content that wasn't strictly meant to be free is included.Now, I will admit, the 10th, special edition, colour is missing, and you lose out on the XBOX One's versions of KI1 and KI2, but what you do get is the full experience, complete with the Shadow opponents being sourced from BOTH XBOX Live and Steam players, meaning that moving to Steam doesn't mean you lose something from the two 'ghost' modes just because you're late to the party.What you're not dealing with is the need to open your wallet every five minutes as the game reminds you to buy something to get the full experience. Instead, you've GOT the full experience, and at a fraction of the price."
76561197989273094,Recommended,577940,35316345,Posted: 29 September,all,War,"Killer Instinct -- an enjoyable fighting game in keeping with Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat.The steam edition is on par with the definitive edition otherwise offered on the Windows store and Xbox. As such, all characters are fully unlocked. Although there are micro transactions, these are entirely optional--as all skins/badges et al. are accessible via regular game play/grinding and are all totally cosmetic.The major two complaints with this iteration of Killer Instinct are as follows:1. Cross platform play for Ranked Matches is blocked between Steam and Win/Xbox player bases. This seems arbitrary and very short sighted on the part of M$.2. The online performance test, which is required for online ranked matches, can prohibit players from participating in ranked matches if their system is deemed to be below certain undisclosed thresholds. This ""black box"" testing is unacceptable as several instances of otherwise viable rigs have been reported as failing this test. However, the feedback afforded from the ingame diagnostic does not give any viable information/suggestions as to what is causing the respective low score (It simply gives a score with a minimum threshold of 1000). This can result in systems, which can run the game perfectly well in unranked matches and single player, being unable to participate in the ranked system.Overall the game is fun and fits well with the original coin-op iterations of KI1 and KI2. However, for online play, due to the opaque performance testing and segregated ranked player bases, cannot be fully recommended. Simply put, the design and implementation of these two elements are abject failures and seem highly arbitrary.Purchase the game for solo play or online unranked play.Do not purchase the game for online ranked play (as you may well be blocked from participating by the game itself).Do not purchase the game if you are keen to complete all achievements -- as several require access to online ranked matches to which you may not have access."
76561198117861835,Recommended,577940,35351944,Posted: 30 September,all,solfizz,"I've been playing fighting games all my life (not tournament-calibur however), and I think that this remake of KI is incredible.I love the creativity and balance between all the characters (from what I've seen and heard).  That's really hard to achieve in a game.  Plus it runs butterly smooth on my 2-year old midrange pc, the loading is fast, and the sound and hits are really sharp and visceral.  You CAN tell that the facial detail isn't as good as that found in other AAA titles in the genre, but it doesn't make that much of a difference once you start spectating the action on the 2d plane where the fighting takes place.While I do like how fast the game plays, I wish there were some ""slow but rewarding if it connects"" kind of moves too.  Think of the charge moves in the Soul Calbir/Tekken series.  Granted I haven't played KI for that long, but I think I've only seen one charge move from Sabrewolf, and when the streamer playing as him tried to perform it in an online match, he failed both attempts.  I know there are characters like Aganos too, but besides those few examples, it seems like the vast majority of attacks are super fast.  However that's just a minor gripe that draws itself from my days with SF2. The fighting game genre has evolved, and KI has moved with the times just fine.There is of course other gripes like me STILL not being able to figure out how to get my Hori Fighting Commander 3 pad to fully work (in the meantime, I'm still playing on the keyboard), and the fact that I get a ""Killer Instinct didn't shut down properly"" message each time I exit.  But those aren't dealbreakers.So far, KI offers so much in style, character creativity and balanced systems that really makes this game stand out from a lot of other fighters I've seen in modern times.  And the fact that it finally came out on Steam makes it possible for Windows 7 users like myself to play this gem for their first time."

,Recommended,577940,35254058,Posted: 27 September,all,Hoodjuro,"Best fighting game i've played in a while!If you remember this game from the SNES and played it, you'll probably have nostalgic feelings toward it like i do.Decided to get this based on that alone, and i'm not disappointed!The amount of modes and screens / info might overwhelm you at first, leaving you wondering where to start.It even has a pretty fleshed out story mode where you prepare your own team of 3 and set out to fight off a demi-god.Granted, the plot could have been written by an 8 year old, but you'll enjoy the ride non the less.Adding to the enjoyment are items and companions that you unlock to give you specials boosts during battle.You can also customize all the fighters with different clothing items if you're into that.The fighting is where its at, and boy is it awesome. It's fast, stylish and satisfying.The whole system is based around combo's, the longer the better! There is a simplified version of this wich is turned on by default. This way you can pull off and enjoy the awesome combat right off the bat.Just as in the classic, the characters look great, have a unique style and appearance. The roster is very decent in size and there's some crazy stuff in there. You'll pretty much want to try them all out, and see what they have to offer. You'll quickly find a character you feel comfortable with and go from there.I could go on for a while. Point is: there is alot to like here!If you even have the slightest interest in fighting games, pick this one up!"
,Recommended,577940,35352154,Posted: 30 September,all,Rick Sanchez,"I've wanted this for a long time, and it's finally happened.The dojo (tutorials) should be your first order of business because this quite the complex fighter. There are a lot of things to know about combo's, how you can link them certain ways, use shadow, enders, juggling, how to use the right combo breaker, etc. I'd say spend an hour or so in there to get up to speed.Sound/Music - Everything from the announcer, to individual sounds characters make from just punches sounds awesome. The music is great. I even had a little fun just scrolling through the pause menu when I figured out the jingle it would make.. lolGraphics - Yea, it's a 3 or 4 year old game at this point since it was released on Xbone release, but it still looks awesome. No complaints.Controls - Tight. Out of any fighter I've played, I think this one would probably be the easiest for a casual to hop in, do some damage, and have fun. Special movies are easy and combo's are a fair challenge to string together into 20+ hits. If you've ever felt the absolute frustration of games like Street Fighter that seem to require you to master frame-by-frame analysis in order to string attacks together, then you'll be relieved to know it's not a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥like that.Online - I played 3 matches so far. Matchmaking took maybe 20 seconds at the longest to find a match. They were fair and pitted me against people of my skill level and ranking. I may come back after I do my 10 qualifying matches and do another 10 or so to give further review on this.Replay value - There is a lot here. Several different fighters with unique styles of play. Online play. Offline play. Story Mode and some strange shadow mode where you build a team, fight, collect items, heal your team, and ultimately save the world from what I can tell.. I haven't gave that much time, so I could be entirely wrong about it.Bottomline - I got it on sale, but I think it's worth it's full price. There's a lot to enjoy here."

,Recommended,577940,35362856,Posted: 30 September,all,Vexxar Al'Hara,"This quickly became one of my favorite fighting games of all time. And it has been only 2 days since I got the game!This game has an amazing gameplay with possibly the best fighting/combo mechanics of all games, in my opinion. You don't have to spend weeks to learn a simple basic combo of a SINGLE character. You don't have to fight more to control your character and do their attacks, instead of focusing in the fun part: Fighting your oponent.In this game it's really straightforward and simple to learn how to combo, but that doesn't mean the game is shallow. Not even close!One of my favorite things in this game, is one of the Killer Instinct's signature: COMBO BREAKER. In other fighting games, when your oponent gets you in a combo string, all you can do is watch and wait as he juggles you around. Well, not in this game!You have a chance to Combo Break his combo, and break free and fight back! And this is not an nearly impossible mechanic that requires weeks of training to get it right. It's as simple as pressing Kick+Punch in the same type your opponent is combo'ing you. (Ex: If he's using Heavy attacks, you press HP+HK, or Medium attacks you press MP+MK, etc.)In this game there's always a way. There's always something you can do to fight back.Not only that, all the characters are very nice, unique and they all act and feel different.The sound effects, the announcer and the music are amazing! (The music was composed by none other than Mick Gordon. The same composer from Doom [2016])Speaking of music, they are all dynamic, changing as the battle progress. Each character has it's own music theme, and they fit them really well.The game has one of the best netcodes I've ever seen.Amazing game modes, like the Shadow Labs, which the game will record the way you play and create an IA that plays like you, so you can fight agains yourself! (Or other IA created by other players).Speaking of IA, the IA controlled opponents are very well done and challenging. It also has many difficulty levels.This is a amazing game I can recommend for ANYONE, even those who are bad at fighting games (I'm one of those XD). It doesn't matter if you only want it for Singleplayer, or Multiplayer. You will have fun either way!"

Yes, my friend, you should, because, by baiting your opponent into breaking your combo, or guessing they will try to break it, you can unleash a counter-breaker, and continue combo-ing them to oblivion as they watch helplessly from a lockout, the mindgames are unleashed, and it becomes very fun!But maybe you don't care about that, maybe you're not really caring about fighting games, maybe you like strategy?Aye, Shadow Lords exists, an entire single-player rogue-like campaign where you manage a team of three characters and deploy them to specific locations, in attempts to hold-out against Gargos' arrival, managing what opponents they fight and what actions they take, picking battles and equipping them with items against an onslaught of powerful mimics and Omens, while still maintaining itself with that fighting game gameplay in action, it becomes fun to even people who aren't interested in fighting games!In general, this game is literally perfect in every way to me, maybe I'm just biased for loving KI since my childhood, it's what made me get into fighting games, and as such, I have sold out my soul to Iron Galaxy and Double Helix, they have created the second coming of fighting game christ after KI1 and 2, BUY IT, SPEND MONEY ON IT, ♥♥♥♥ YOUR REBEL/DINOSAUR/GHOST/ROBOT/NUNCHUCK MARTIAL ARTIST WIFE AND PRAISE BE TO GARGOS!"

,Recommended,577940,35399972,Posted: 1 October,all,Man of the Storm,"Quite possibly one of the most satisfying fighting game experiences. The game itself is just a fantastic plethora of fighting game quality and it was a must have for anyone that bought an Xbox One. However, now that it's out for PC it brings a breath of fresh air for this genre that has been lacking on the market and that is the fun factor. We have seen games such as Street Fighter 5 and Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite trying to cater to the professional audience in order to deliver a very balanced, or in some cases unbalanced, game that is very strict and unforgiving to the average consumer. However that's not what everyone wants, it's been stated that there's no point in playing a game that's not fun,Killer Instinct has pulled the 180 that this market needs and that is to give a fighitng game experience that doesn't want you to smash your head through the Keyboard/Arcade stick/Controller. The gameplay is solid and fluid with every action. When you are able to string combos it's not a maticuluous and arguous process that can be punished, it's a fun easy to learn hard to master style. The Ultra combos are satisfying and rewarding when able to pull them off mid endgame fights, yet still feel deserved and not boring.There are some issues like the system being a bit confusing right off the start of the game, such as the set up. Honestly all you have to do is put the game in borderless mode to insure that the game goes fullscreen upon startup but fullscreen mode will reset if you set that as default. The game unfortunately does not support anything except mircosoft controllers and arcade sticks but this is easily fixed with JoystickToKey.Overall it's an amazing experience that should be enjoyed for all fighting game lovers as a testiment of how fun these games should be.

Killer Instinct satisfies my needs brilliantly.  There are a ton of characters to choose from the the controls are smooth.  The soundtrack is amazing and the graphics are top notch.  On top of that each character has a ton of different skins you can unlock and many also have the old retro skins from back in the day.The game is easy to pick up, and with the vast training mode you can hone your skills, combos, and timing till you hearts content.  I've tried this with both the Steam Controller and the XBOX 360 controller and both work well.  The steam controller in my experience is a little better especially when trying to perform the circular moves, but this all comes down to personal preference.  I don't really like the 360 controller for fighting games, but if that is something you're used to, then go for it.  I did not try this with my PS4 controller, because I don't feel like setting it up, but I am sure it will work as well.  I will try it eventually however.   If for some reason it doesn't work, I'll be sure to update my review accordingly.

,Recommended,577940,35426086,Posted: 2 October,all,Redey59,"A very easy recommendation for anyone even slightly interested in fighting games.Pros:+ One of the best ways to enter the fighting game genre as it has the most extensive tutorial I've ever seen, combined with an amazing AI system in the form of the ""Shadow Lab"", a system that makes a shadow version of yourself for you to practice against and send out to other players playing Shadow Survival. (think Sm4sh Amiibo's but online sharing compatable and extremely good at actually mimicing the actual player).You can literally play against ""yourself"", punish your own mistakes and then have that same AI in the next round use the new punish you just found against you, which creates this infinite cycle of ""getting gud"". (also, I aint gonna lie, the fact you can see how your AI ruined someone's survival streak is amazing as you get a fully high detailed replay of it)+ Varied and big roster, while most characters share the same input style (quarter circle + punch/kick motions) the way they end up fighting differs greatly: from the close range rushdown god that is Sabrewulf to the frustrating keepaway of Glacius to the straight up terrifying grappling of General Raam, it's all here.+ Dynamic Music by Mick Gordon, the same guy that made the Doom soundtrack and it's just as amazing here.If you need a good sample of what's ingame, personal recommendations would be Hinnamatoom, Inferno and I'm Back (to Rise), Thunder, Cinder and TJ Combo's themes respectively.+ Amazing Netcode, and a reletively healthy playerbase thanks to crossplay.+ Unique combo and combo breaking system, the definition of ""easy to learn, hard to master""Cons:- Unskippable win animations, no biggie in online but when running arcade or survival this gets repetetive fast, especially on characters with a lengthy win animation- If you plan on playing a character that's not from the season 1 or 2 roster you won't be having an arcade mode, this is replaced with a ""Shadow Lords"" mode (which season 1 and 2 characters can also play), Shadow Lords is nice but the missing arcade mode for these characters is a bit odd- Ranked mode does not have crossplay enabled for one reason or another.- The free to play version is still being held hostage by Microsoft, which is a real shame considering how great it is at teaching how to play the genre as a whole.No more Windows store / 10"

I had the prima guide that showed frame by frame combos and breaker techniques and I studied it very intensely. I had a rival who was quite good at it too and pushed me to improve constantly. KI was an awesome fighting game and an innovator of its genre. I remember when the X1 was release and being sad that it was only on x1. Now here it is. I sense all the nostalgia and fun I had before and they have even improved. While Im quite rusty Im quickly picking up on it and I hope to be at least 1/2 as good as I was before.

I can't recall having this much fun with a fighting game since Mortal Kombat X (minus the PC issues of course). I've been dying for a Steam version of this game for a long time. I have played both the Xbox One version and the Windows 10, and both are fine enough. This version does away with the F2P model and for the price ($30 on sale at the time of review) is well more than worth it. As a fighting game, it's incredible, and insanely rewarding and fun to play. There is a deep, yet deceptively simple set of mechanics that lets you jump in and play, and sink time in to master. If you love fighting games, you owe it to yourself to at least try this game, and please, have a blast with it.

The game is very polished if you think for the time it came out. I have so far not seen a hiccup in the steam version yet. The battle system is very simplistic but feels like your playing guitar hero with fighters as it goes with a certain rythym and beat. Sometimes even to the music. I now figured out where Marvel Versus Capcom Infinite got their simplistic old style type arcade beat em fighter and it was from K.I. Meaning it was nothing innovative what they thought.

,Recommended,577940,35320011,Posted: 29 September,all,devlkore,"Quick Review:I haven't even seen all the characters, let alone played as them. I've spent most of my time as Hisako, but dabbled with a few others. I'm by no means a master at the game, but I (think I) understand the mechanics, which IMO are the most important part of a fighting game. The game is deep, and in very surprising ways. A lot of the back-and-forth of other fighting games has shifted *into* the combo system here. You still throw pokes and there are mix-ups aplenty, but landing a hit and going into a combo is only the beginning of the mind games due to the intricate combo and combo breaker system. It's really refreshing to actually be encouraged to freestyle combos, rather than just learn ""the best"" combo and fish for a hit to play a rhythm/memory game. Don't get me wrong, I love many other fighting games from Arcana Heart 3 to Marvel 3, but the uniqueness of KI is refreshing.The graphics are great, with over the top designs and ridiculous amounts of effects and particles. It's kind of garish to be honest, but I do like the aesthetic.Soundtrack is awesome, I highly suggest buying it with the OST if you like heavy, epic, electro, metal music.About a year ago I played the free/demo version on the windows store and I had to turn down a bunch of settings to pass the online test (to prevent system slow down causing problems), but it seems they have done LOTS of optimisation since then as I can run it at max settings, 1080p with the exact same computer. For reference, I'm playing on a laptop with:Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB16GB RAMWindows 10Using a MadCatz Street Fighter 4 SE Stick, Xbox 360 versionThe online allows for crossplay between Xbone/Windows Store/Steam play, EXCEPT in ranked, where it is Steam only. I do hope they integrate ranked in the future, but I've always been able to find matches and for the most part they run very smoothly. One of the better fighting game net codes I've experienced."

However, I read that they were aesthetic items only, and all can be earned in game through normal gameplay, so I gave it a pass.What I didn't know is that Iron Galaxy and M$ put an obxnious ""store"" entry on the main menu (which does NOT have an OPTIONS entry, btw, you need to find it in submenus) with a bouncing ""!"" icon next to it that you apparently cannot disable. This is flatly unacceptable and a non-starter.[update] According to someone who responded to my review, this annoying icon can be disabled by hitting ""y"" on the controller (and presumably a keyboard key) that I was not aware of. I tried clicking on the menu option to make it go away, it didn't. I'm still against it being there at all.It also for some wierd reason defaulted to windowed mode while playing and set all graphical settings to minimal, even though I'm running a GTX 1070 (easily fixed, but annoying default behavior). In addition, the game delays letting you play while it syncronizes with their servers for ""shadow lords"" or something similar, which I can only presume is related to updating the aforementioned store content. It does this every single time you run the game and there doesn't appear to be a way to disable this behavior.In regards to the actual gameplay, it is much as I remember it from the 90's. An approachable and entertaining button masher. I only played a few matches against the AI, so I cannot give much insight into the mechanics. I did enjoy seeing Rash from Battletoads make an appearance.For me to ever consider coming back to this game, Microsoft/Iron Galaxy would need to either A. remove all store/microtransaction nonsense from the game, entirely. Or B. keep the microtransaction nonsense and make this a free to play game, as they've obviously modeled it after. I don't expect they will be doing either, so this will likely be the only time I ever play KI for steam.Very disappointed."

,Recommended,577940,35255489,Posted: 27 September,all,Zatsuza,"I've put a ton of time into the Windows 10/Xbox One version of the game so excuse the low playtime. Also, I'm not a pro player by any stretch but I'm pretty decent-ish at this game.This game is really lovely. I personally didn't think much of the original games at all and was skeptical when this was announced but since then it has probably become one of my favorite in the genre.The cast of characters is bananas in every way and covers a lot of playstyles. Want to zone? You got that. Want to be a grappler? Sure! Want to rush down but also zone and how you play that character is determined entirely by RNG? Absolutely! It can seem overwhelming because you effectively have to learn how to fight all of this but it's a lot of fun figuring that out, at least for me.One thing about this game also is everything is governed by the combo system which is very unique. Don't think of it as combos and more like mixups. Every combo in this game can be broken as long as you guess correctly and nothing is guaranteed. However, if you try to break a combo and the opponent guesses that you are going to break, they can effectively extend their combo if they guess right. If they're wrong they have a huge cooldown window for you to punish. It's largely all mindgames and execution isn't really a barrier here. Quarter circles, tapping back to forward (or down to up), and the standard dragon punch is all you'll get here. In a way it gives people who may lack execution a chance. Obviously there is more to this game than the combo system but it's hard to cover all of that in a review. See the bottom for a link to a guide.On a pure visual level it has some pretty great art. Characters are modeled well, stages look really good, and everything seems to pop. It's usually pretty consistent across the board. In terms of audio, the soundtrack is amazing. Mick Gordon started getting his name out with this game and it shows. Later music by Celldweller and Atlas Plug is also generally pretty good but I prefer Mick's music for the most part.Anyway I really like this game and everyone should give it a shot, especially if you like fighting games and want to try something a little different. If you're having any trouble, a KI player named Infilament made a great guide that explains the ins and outs of how the game works.http://ki.infil.net/index.html"

I have a couple small issues, like the game starting in windowed whether you have it set to fullscreen or borderless, which is a bit irritating. The big issue is no support for PS3/PS4 sticks, even if you have DS4Windows installed. I still need to use XOutput, which is extremely frustrating. Still needs some fixing but online is solid."
,Recommended,577940,35423742,Posted: 2 October,all,Dymlos,"I've put in several hundred hours into the Xbox One / Windows 10 version of KI, so ignore the finite Steam version in-game time.Killer Instinct is one of the best fighting games of this generation. Season 3 overhauled the combo system, and Iron Galaxy has been relentless with well thought-out balance changes. They really listen to the community, and they love the game which is evident in each character design. The passion they pour into the game is immense.It has the best netcode of any fighting game, and the community is strong and active throughout.The Dojo (in-game tutorial) teaches you all of the mechanics in a meaningful way (great to learn about fighting games in general), and has hands down the best online resource available(ki.infil.net)for any game ever (easy reading, thorough explanations, tooltips, and gifs galore).The combo system is an anchor of familiarity which allows you to more easily pick up a new character and explore various play styles. For example, I play Jago, Sabrewulf, Glacius, Arbiter, Sadira, TJ Combo, Omen, Riptor, Hisako, and Fulgore. Note the system can be as complex as you want to make it, allows for an additional layer of decision making, and supports a scope of what I like to call ""calm"" execution. It should not be scoffed at, and in my mind, deserves much praise.Give this game an honest try, and I promise you won't be disappointed. Fight on!"

After playing about an hour of it, I feel that it's a game definitely worth playing if you're a Killer Instinct fan. It's not like one of those new fighters that have recently been released where it feels incomplete and you know DLC will come out to get you to spend more money on it (looking at Capcom).Graphics: Aren't the best but still pretty enough to not have your eyes sore.Sound: It's great, music gives the same feeling as the original on SNES. The narrator in the story mode isn't bad but he seems to be lacking something.Controls: They flow well and don't feel clunky which makes it even more satisfying to dish out all the combos to kick butt.Overall, it's definitely worth a shot at playing."

I would like very much for full 21:9 support but i WOULD recommend the game to people i trust in the condition it is in for the price it was released at.Old ReviewI bought and own an xbox one JUST for this game, it is literally the only game i own on that system, and I love it!The though of being able to play this game with Powerful PC hardware was a dream come true!!! glorious 21:9 aspect ratio, massive antialaising, maybe even some added post processing injection, OMG! I can't wait... oh, one second...That is until i loaded the game.Starts Windowed mode = FAIL (too small on my 32"" Ultrawide) I'm not playing in a pillar boxed cube in the middle of my monitor.Go to change the Resolutions and find they're not supported = FAIL (3440x1440 not supported) nor is any other 21:9 resolutionScaling looks like GARBAGE, (2450x1440) is hilariously scrunched to a 4:3 window and jaggy/alaised.This is a PC game!!! hardware scalability is the REASON people play on PC, I plan to get a refund in a few days if not patched, this is completely unacceptible... supporting all screen resolutions is kind of a basic thing. Like step one of beta testing...MANY people are reporting graphics problems, with resolution and refresh rates.Hold off purchase until resolved"

,Recommended,577940,35393819,Posted: 1 October,all,Dr. Cheesesteak,"A great fighting game.  An excellent replacement for NRS games if you don't have a current gen console and used to play MK/Inj a lot.+ Nice mix of inputs for a variety of characters.  Characters also all have their own features or passives, making them all unique.+ Combos have a low floor but high ceiling in regards to skill level to pull off the vast range of hits.  The simpler 8-15 hit ones that do 20ish% dmg are easy.  The huge insane ones not so much.+ Great netcode.+ Shadow Lords is such an amazing mode.  It's like base defense of XCOM w/ a team of characters you send out on missions.+ They've added to the already great variety of aesthetic/flavor on the characters.  Old KI was cool w/ elemental beings, boxers, werewolves, cyborgs, dinosaurs, etc.  Now there are mummies, earth golems, vampires, Japanese horror girls, etc.+ Good selection of ancillary modes - Shadow Lords, Shadow Labs, Survival, even a Combo Breaker Training.+ Tons of unlockables for costumes/profile banner.+ Robust profile stat tracking.  Tracks stats in basically all modes for all characters, even their highest-count combo.+ Even for a 4-year old niche game, the devs are still involved.  Game was patched just a month ago (they say possibly their last, but they're still active in the forums, social media, etc).+ Some music is really good/catchy and the sfx are great.+ CPU v CPU!+- Can't control difficulty of Shadow Lords mode.  Unless you have Combo Assist on, training will be necessary for at least 3 characters.- Story Mode and Shadow Lords story are a bit underwhelming (but there is a ton of backstory you can find online to make up for it, I guess).- Combo Assist Mode can make you develop bad habits.- Some unlockables come at a great price - monetarily or time-sink wise."

76561197974054532,Recommended,577940,35273955,Posted: 28 September,all,Optimus Tager,"Edited 2.10.2017Originally I gave this game a thumbs down due to the fact that the game simply refused to start. The problem was with the Steam version of the game, which - for some reason - could not generate the file where the game saves the graphics settings and tried to force a resolution my computer simply could not either handle or compute. This problem has been remedied now thanks to a good friend of mine, who bought this game just so that he could try and fix it. And fix it he did. In less than five minutes.My problem was related to the start up problem some seem to have, where starting the game will bring up only a white window with the words ""not responding"" in the upper left corner. You will need to download someone's configuration files - who did not have this issue - and place them into your Killer Instinct root folder. If you wish to do this yourself, set all your graphic settings to low or off and the resolution to 720p and then pack all the configuration files from the KI’s root folder into a .zip or .rar file and send it to your friend(s) who might be having this problem. (I will provide a link to the one that helped me at the end of this review, once I’ve found a place where I can host it.)- Graphics-The graphics of this game are surprisingly good looking considering its age. True, they've been enhancing it over the years, but the core models and the textures are still there, and they look good. I like how much options they've given us to adjust the visuals, something which many fighting games have failed to do when they've been ported to PC. Though to some the particle effects may be bit much at times; the screen is filled with literal fireworks when the characters clash and beat the tar out of each other. I myself like it, as it gives the fighting its own kind of intensity.-Gameplay-The game play is surprisingly solid for a western fighting game. One of the best, if not the best, I'd say. Some people I've heard complaining that the inputs are too forgiving and how it’s too easy to pull off visually impressive combos in this game. I say, that's the whole point. This game is all about going crazy, rushing your opponent and delivering all sorts of insane combos you rarely see in any other fighting game in the market. In terms of pacing, I don't think there really is any other fighting game in the market - aside the BlazBlue series - that comes close to KI in terms of speed and intensity.-Sounds-I really like the voice acting, though some of the lines the characters say are bit cheesy at times. And while some of the music in this game can be bit average, vast majority of it really gets my blood pumping. I'd like to recommend that you look into buying the game's soundtrack, but only after taking a small sample what they're like from youtube - just in case you're not friend of metal, because that's the genre of majority of the music in the game.-Advertisement-Ok...what the Hell? There was literally no warning whatsoever; they just up and put this game up in Steam without proper advertisement. While I'm sure people will find it, the publisher would have gotten far better initial sales if they'd put at least some marketing into this release.-Micro transactions-Yes, there are micro transactions in this game, but they can be largely ignored, unless you're really impatient on unlocking the cosmetics for the game's characters through playing the arcade-, vs-, story- or survival mode (And unlike in Street Fighter 5, in KI it doesn’t feel like a chore). Everything else in this version of the Killer Instinct has been unlocked from the get go.https://www.dropbox.com/s/q38h9ui9ha85awk/Killer%20Instinct.rar?dl=0(Get it while you can, I hope it helps those who are having the whitescreen problem. Just unpack the file into your Killer Instinct root folder in the Steam library folder.)"

My only complaint is the missing K.I. 1 arcade version. Hopefully they will port it to Windows 7 soon. I promised I would buy this game, if it ever got released for Windows 7 and it did, so I now own it. There is a strange crash when i close out of the game ""ucrtbase.DLL"" which apparently is a Windows 10 file that the Windows 7 steam version is trying to access for some reason. If you want K.I. on Steam, here it is, what more can I say? Oh, there is an ""easy combo mode"" which is enabled by default, which is awesome, and the default difficulty is on easy, so you can win fights right away."
,Recommended,577940,35510131,Posted: 5 October,all,しにたい,"I just wanna get this outta the way immediately: I'm getting a refund for this game because unfortunately it doesn't run properly on my LAPTOP (I expected it, it no way detracts from my love for this game. Just means I have to play it on XBone)Those who play street fighter, uMVC3 or Tekken may find this game to be simple on the technical side of things, that's because this game puts an emphasis on adapting to an opponent's patterns, since the combo pattern is relatively straightforward. (Opener -> Auto Double/Manual -> linker  -> ender. Steps two and three can be repeated until the KV (Knockdown Value) reaches 100, at which point the character being hit will spin out and the combo will end without being able to end it. Keep in mind that you can end the combo if the last hit before the ender pushes the KV meter above 100.The complexity of this game comes from, as I said, the adaptations that players make during matches. I'm not going to go into detail with just HOW complex it is, because that'd make this review longer than it needs to be, but tl;dr if you're quick to adapt, you will excel at this game. Punishing an opponent's mistake is very satisfying as every combo can potentially do 30%+ damage, depending on how you do it.But, alongside the layers upon layers of guessing, adapting and predicting what your opponent is going to do, further complexity is given through the mechanic of combo traits. These are character-specific traits which aid them in some way. For example, I'm a Sadira main. Sadira's combo trait is air juggle,  she is the first character in the series to have a proper air combo system, and you can have some really fancy comboes that start on the ground and end in the air.ON TOP of combo traits, there's also a mechanic specific to this game that adds a way to extend comboes: Instinct mode. When you activate instinct mode mid-combo, it resets the KV meter I spoke about before, while keeping your ender level the same. Not only does it reset the combo, allowing you to essentially double the damage, but it gives your character MORE traits that help them. Again, take Sadira as an example. Her instinct mode gives her access to web traps, which allow you to place a static, area-controlling web in front of her. This has a myriad of uses: making combo breaker attempts safe, anti-airing, extra damage/hitstun, just to name a few. It really has Sub-Zero ice clone vibes. Not only that, but during her instinct mode, she also gains the ability to jump-cancel her normals. This leads to, assuming you're in a combo, A LOT of damage, as you can link a heavy kick into itself for massive damage. But your opponent has the choice of whether or not to break it, or predict that you're going to throw an occasional light kick in to try and block them out from counter breakers. Or you could take a chance and throw out a counter breaker to reset the combo AGAIN.That's what this game is about. Risk vs reward: knowing when to take a risk, when not to take one, and even by not taking a risk, you're taking one, if that makes any sense.I haven't even brought up one-player modes. As with every fighting game I've played, the AI on very hard/maximum difficulty feels cheap, especially in this game where breaking a combo all depends on if you adapt and choose the right attack strength to break against. The AI has an ""Ultimate"" difficulty, also known as Kyle, I'm assuming a programmer who developed the game. It's unbeatable, I gave it two tries and stopped because it wasn't fun. It gives off classic Mortal Kombat vibes, where you have to cheap the game out with safe moves and conform to a playstyle that you don't necessarily want to use and don't have fun with. That being said, medium/hard difficulty is fun.Shadow lords is a refreshing amalgamation of RPG elements combined with the core game to make a less serious but still really fun game mode. Upon first glance you may think ""WOW, that enemy has 50% extra health? That's BULL."" But you'll soon realise that you, too, have the opportunity to buff your character's stats through the use of consumable items and guardians. Consumables range from using them before the match to give your character full instinct/shadow meter, healing the character (because health carries over after a match if you win, if you lose, that character dies but can be resurrected if you have the item for it) to dealing more/taking less damage in the match. Guardians give passive boosts to your stats (Trust me, if you want to unlock the astral plane stage by beating Gargos on challenging difficulty, you're going to NEED the stat boosts) but they also give an active effect that you need to charge the guardian to use. You charge the guardian with astral energy that you gain by playing the game mode. I mentioned unlocking the Astral Plane as a stage because it shows that, even though there's microtransactions in the game, that stage cannot be unlocked by paying for it. You can accelerate its unlocking by paying for KI gold to buy strong guardians, but it isn't paywalled: you can earn those guardians by playing the game, and I did, I didn't spend anything on it. It just took longer.As for online: I don't know, I haven't played it on PC so I can't judge the netcode, I live in Australia so the connections to other players on a good day would be average at best, and I haven't played it online on the XBone.Now for the tl;dr pros&cons:Pros:Every character feels fresh and unique, and aren't typical/stereotypical (Jago isn't a Japanese Ninja or black belt, he's a Tibetan Monk, how many fighting games have such an unorthodox character/personality?)Combo system is relatively simple and easy to grasp; friendly/welcoming to new players, easy to master and excel atLooks great.AWESOME guest characters from other Rareware/xbox games (Rash, Arbiter, General Raam).AWESOME music. DYNAMIC music, aka the music changes depending on what's happening in the match, never seen it before.FULL transparency of moves (frame data, other info on moves such as invincibility, frame advantage on block, etc. For people like me who want to know their character inside out, this is GREAT.)Despite the simple combo system, the game still has footsies, spacing, etc.You earn extra colours/cosmetics while playing the character and levelling them up, giving more incentive to play the character.Tier lists aren't as conclusive in other games. While Fulgore is REALLY good, characters are really well balanced.Lots of characters.ConsWhile the combo system is fun, comboes can start to feel stale after doing them so many times, even if you mix up attack strengths.Microtransactions: You can buy all colours except for the level 50 colour, letting you buy the colour you want and not bothering with the rest, devaluing the whole ""earn it through gameplay"" system.Microtransactions : You can buy guardians and healing items in Shadow lords, which (for me) devalues unlocking the astral plane as a stage.AI can feel cheap, as with every fighting game, and inhuman in reaction times.Microtransactions: Just because they're a trend in games nowadays doesn't mean I have to like them.In summary: If you're a fighting game fan, give it a try. Do I recommend it? YES. It's such a fun game."
