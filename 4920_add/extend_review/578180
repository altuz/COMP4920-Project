,Not Recommended,578180,29451416,Posted: 23 January,all,Jonathan,"Honestly just seems like a bunch of assets thrown together without any effort or thought put into it. Also, by default, the HUD is disabled, you'll have to press F11 to enable it.Small corridors, small amounts of enemies, small play time, small review. Don't play this.EDIT: Also, it's very misleading, as it says ""Story"" and ""Achievement"" in the description so, yeah, that's great too. Glad to know scamming is still a thing on Steam. Neato.EDIT 2/7/2017: Is it just me or did he edit the game's description and just added ""(soon)"" right next to the achievement text we just found out he's actually scamming? Funny."
,Not Recommended,578180,31065335,Posted: 10 April,all,CorvusCorax,"This is the single worst game I have ever played in my life. Quickly put together with the use of the so-called GameGuru as a means of an easy cash-grab. Funny thing is when you want to quit the game crashes and it says GameGuru Map Editor stopped working.When launching this garbage a GameGuru advertisement is what you see followed by the main menu. You can start a new game, load an existing one or quit. Since the game can literally be completed in 4 minutes (speedrun is done in 20 seconds as you simply run and then turn left, right, left, right, then right and left) the savegame system makes no sense. I do not even remember if there's an option, at all, in the ingame menu to save your ""progress"".This menu offers some graphics options (low, medium, high), however, the changes are barely noticeable and some sound options. I did not save so I found it interesting that I could load an existing save from the main menu - it appears the game saves at the start of a new game (?).""Full of horrible creatures"" says the developer in the trailer. You have only two that make the same sound and they often get stuck in the corridor. If you they die there's a 50% chance they become immobile (you are free to walk past them). You have a pistol and shotgun you pick up next to dead bodies - you have no indication as to how many bullets you have. You do not have any health indicator, either. You are only given instructions as to what to press to pick up these weapons. But then again if you are an FPS veteran you know which button you use to jump, crouch, shoot and of course reload.The irony really is the length of the game. The video even shows the hazard radiation sign which is supposed to indicate the exit. As you approach it you get back to the main menu. You have a couple of sound effects only (such as the shots and the howling of the monsters) and that's it. By the way instead of black for me all corridors were white. I checked the menu for gamma options to see if this was a settings issue - of course, to no avail.The idea of refunding half a euro is ridiculous. To keep the game running for extra trading cards evokes the same emotion. However, taking a large dose of Prozac is a good solution - regardless of the oncoming side effects and allergic reactions I may have."

I literally beat the game TWICE in ten minutes. It is a shame because the game actually has potential. The enemies are kind of cool (although they locked up both playthroughs and stopped moving bugged).The game also to it's credit has gfx settings once you are in the actual game, such as a welcomed FOV slider etc.In the end, ONE level with enemies in the same place every time, is simply not acceptable....even for a 1$ game.Add a bunch more levels, and I would actually enjoy it."

It's more of a demo than a game.To the dev: I get that it's only $0.99, but come on man, 2 guns, 8 enemies, and 2 minutes of gameplay isn't a ""game"".Here's the gameplay so you can see what I mean.

,Not Recommended,578180,29475832,Posted: 24 January,all,SidAlpha,"https://youtu.be/xJX-u9rU9SMLost Base Escape is a cheap cash-grab Game Guru asset flip ""game"" with such a small amount of content as to be absolutely insulting to any intelligent human being that it require money to change hands.While recording for a First Impressions video (link above), I discovered approximately 6 minutes in that I had beaten the game in it's entirety. In disbelief, I played through a 2nd time hoping... PRAYING... that I had missed something. But no, I again managed to beat the game in less than 3 minutes. The only reason why I am showing so much play time on this game (0.6 hours) is that my first run-through had audio issues and I was forced to re-record twice, tripling the total amount of play time available plus a little extra.Bland gameplay, broken AI, when it attempts to function at all, areas where you cannot shoot through an open door into another room as it hits an invisible wall. Glitches forcing dead ""enemies"" to freeze in place instead of properly showing their death animations, and still more bugs on top of this game being insultingly brief.This game earns my first ever 1/10. An affront to the senses and a prime example of zero-effort greed and amoral behavior, Lost Base Escape should be destroyed on sight."

76561197971328127,Not Recommended,578180,29705256,Posted: 4 February,all,SodaBreadGamer,"Even though it may cost only $0.99, it is not worth it. I would not recommend it even if it was free, it was that much a waste of time. The whole game can be completed in about three minutes, and the game play is horrendous. Some enemies do not react to being shot, and just stand there until they die. Even when they die there is a chance they won't fall over, as the animations sometimes fail to happen. Absolutely abysmal, and Valve should be ashamed at what Steam has become.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gj1mRmGDhQ&t=2s"

Boy, were those reviews correct. The game literally took me less time to beat then it took to download. And it took 50 seconds to download. Also, the monsters are dumb af and when you kill them with the shotgun, their bodies freeze in the air. Not a good game."
,Not Recommended,578180,31090295,Posted: 11 April,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Picking a place to start with Lost Base Escape is extremely difficult, so let's just jump into this feces fest and get it over with. First of all, I'm going to issue a scam warning. This title does not look anything like what is shown on the store page, in fact it is the opposite. Everything is bright white, and the ""siren"" light is even white. I took a gander at some YouTube videos and saw that this title was actually originally dark, but I have no idea what happened; whether the developer got sick of complaints, or decided to troll, or what. I've included a link to my YouTube video at the bottom of this review. To further dissect the store page, the developer has been promising one achievement ""soon"" since this title released. There's also apparently an ""interesting story"" that didn't make its way into this trash heap; there's not even one word of dialogue, written or spoken.Second, this ""game"" can be completed in 22 seconds in a speedrun. A normal playthrough takes about 2 and a half minutes, if you explore every corridor. The enemy AI is so bad that the two different monster models (one being a ripoff from Deadspace's Necromorphs) will just stop functioning for no reason. Surprisingly, there is a save and load system, but why? It's pointless for the small duration of the title. There is also an option to change the graphics from low, to medium, and high, but it makes absolutely no difference. Oh, and if you were wondering, the ""engine"" that is used is GameGuru.I'm legitimately blown away as to how something this spectacularly awful was able to make its way onto Steam. I mean come on, Lord Kress... is that you? Next thing you know, this guy is going to tell the community that the upload got corrupted due to a patch gone awry. It may be only a dollar, even less if you grab it on sale, but don't support this scummy scam developer. It might have taken an entire hour's worth of work to ""create"" Lost Base Escape.Rating:0.0/5.0- WARNING. Scam developer.

You spawn on a deserted space station with zero explination (I am assuming it's from all the children you tried killing in other games/IRL). You find a pistol, ammo, and hear the sounds of someone yelling about the fact the jam jars are all screwwed on too tightly and they desperately want a PB&J sandwhich.You walk around using the usual controls, and when you walk up to certain... doors...? They open. Surprise... I suppose. The first friends you meet are mentally damaged children who just happen to be 6 feet tall and have their brains growing out of their skulls. They take a step forward about once ever few seconds and are easilly confused with spacial problems.Your pistol... works. I guess. You have 4 round mags. Why? Lord knows. It's a 1911... yet only holds half the standard pistol capacity. But okay, fine... it's got super small mags... so you shoot the dunces. Who just probably need help opening a jar. It takes 3 rounds to kill one. So basically a mag a piece.Cool.After you wander around some more, you find a shotgun. Yipee, another gun to throw on the pile... never bothered to count the shells. It takes 1-3 shells per enemy, including a new one that has *gasp* 4 arms. Two of which are knive shaped... and likely what the other guys planned on using the spread their condiment of choice. They also groan like they desperately need help solving basic math problems.What is sad... is they forget when they die. At least half of the time on my playthrough after I shot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s they just froze in place... obviously forgetting in their thick skulls that they were dead.Total playtime... 3 mins. And I beat this poor excuse of a game.Pass on it... or watch a youtube video. It'll save you time and effort. Hell reading this took you more time than wasting your money on this♥♥♥♥♥♥game."
