A lot more fun.This ""game"" or unity build has slow gameplay, there is unfair hitting from the fast zombies, no ironsides, no recoil - bad shooter mechanics.All in all, a pointless game, a timewaste.I'm not hating but I see the game how it is. Bad."

This is kind of hard to review as it has own potential and good sides even though it's quite short and lack on content in major parts. I wish I could give it neutral opinion as this game hits it's own tiny spot inside me but that's it. The developer has tried to put tiny bit of RPG elements inside this game, but not so much that I would advertise it. For the price, well it was pretty cheap (0,54€) and I would say the price was spot on, although I wouldn't have complained for getting it even cheaper.Pros:- Perfectly short for the game content, any longer and you would be bored.- Not bad price if you have that little bit of extra- Graphics and the texture resolution is perfect for those who like to see older style (eg Half-Life 1 and earlier)Cons:- No intro or outro, you just drop on the beach and that's it. When you complete the game you go to menu. That's it!- Hunger is just there, affects tiny bit for your stamina and healt regen, but even though your hunger bar is empty, nothing happens- Some weapon just meh- Hard to hit running zombies but in no point, they were any threat. Not even the big one.- If you demand good content or want eye candy, this is not for you.- Extremely short. When you start to play you notice soon that you are at the final level.- No challenge, really! Just shoot or whack with wrench or knife and you are done, only 1 type of enemy takes good beating, but with 5 shotgun shots and it is over.I hope this helps a bit for those who like retro look for games, but doesn't demand much (or actually anything at all) Then this game is for you, just a quick fun and then you forget the whole game.Have fun :)"

Pretty typical here on Steam, and like most of them, this one has bland level design, the guns feel absolutely weak and non-satisfying to shoot, the enemies are braindead, and overall, it's the standard affair you'd expect on this platform. Also, it's puzzling that the first game came onto Steam after the second one."
,Not Recommended,578250,33488438,Posted: 12 July,all,Dr. Hax,"Asset flipping dirty devs. Do not support this game. Many of the assets used in this game can be found in many different free to play titles. The gunplay is wonkey all enemies are so incompetent that you will be able to breeze through this game in no time on the only difficulty setting and then get bored and never play it again. I want my money back, if this game were free i would want my free back.2 out of 10 still better than call of duty."
76561197972483399,Recommended,578250,31678371,Posted: 10 May,all,Hamburger!,"For a buck? You can't really go wrong. I got my dollars worth.Here are my pros and cons:Pros-Plays like a level from half-life. Not much too it, but what's there is ok. Surprising selection of weapons for a game so short, but I really enjoyed finding and wielding the katana. Monsters are sufficiently creepy even if their pathing isn't always the best... the fact that they are always on you so you may not be safe to search containers for stuff was fun.Cons: Has an armor and inventory system that is downright backward. You'll never need to replace any armor you find, really -- so the idea of having it be an element of inventory management is kind of silly. More regarding inventory... you'll never run low on health and barely need to make decisions about ammo.... why is there a system to manage that stuff when in games like half-life every weapon hasan ammo maximum and you don't have to fiddle with a window to sort your shotgun shells from your oranges and salamis. Which brings me to the hunger element.... if being hungry did anything in this game, I didn't notice. It was just some strange third bar -- I never ran out of stamina either so two out of three bars in the display are somewhat silly... that leaves the health bar... needed, but considering how easy and short the game was I think it would have been a better gameplay decision to not include the health bar and leave you guessing how injured you might be.I've given games with much more polish bad reviews but I still recommend this game. Why? Because it's not pretending to be something it's not... it's a buck title and you'll get your money's worth.Although I will say the game would have benefited if the notes about the complex were in good english, and that there was actually a mystery to unravel. The story arc in the scraps around the base are basically ""Uh oh! Experiment to make supersoldiers backfires! you better escape!"" -- also best left unsaid.You escape in a helicopter you neither summon nor tells you it is coming -- so the ending is very ""Deus ex machina"" besides. I would have much rather there be a twist ending where you got infected during your adventure and you end up spreading the virus off the island (or the final battle being you becoming a mutant and attacking the helicopter) or even just being shot rather than rescued and the island being bombed into oblivion... I mean, lets have a narrative, people.Also some voice acting would have been nice, even if it was in a different language -- that could make it all the scarier.There were a lot of missed opportunities, and I can't believe I blew through it so fast without much difficulty (and they really should have difficulty levels for those of us who might like a challenge) but overall I can't hate on it -- it's selling itself as an appetizer, and I would have loved to spend 4 quarters on this game at a movie theater or when I was a kid.So thumbs up. Barely."

While it is VERY short and extremely easy, its important to remember you only get so much bang for your buck on steam and with cheap games like these its really hit or miss. Also quick note that the footage showed in the trailer is basically all the content in the game theres not much between the lines there. Still pretty fun for how cheap it was."
,Not Recommended,578250,34673019,Posted: 1 September,all,Queenie,"I will give this game credit, it made me jump out of my skin, when a zombie seemingly appeared behind me. I find it hilarious that developers of tripple A horror games have tried for years to scare me with scripted jump scares and grotesque cutscenes, usually littered with QTEs but one randomly appearing zombie managed to scare the hell out of me.That's it for the positives.This game sucks, I had some good will towards this game, it felt like some effort was put into it in a weird way. It attempts atmosphere with some rather impressively placed sound effects but aside from that, this game looks like Half Life if it fell on its♥♥♥♥♥♥Most of this is forgivable, this game would have passed with a 2/10 score but I'm taking the 2 points I was going to give to this game away, because of the ending.So, the ending is kind of like the end of a Left 4 Dead campaign. You have to fight off hordes of zombies, waiting for the elevator to arrive, so that you can make it to the surface. There's some music playing that tries to add suspense but it sucks and fails to do this and after waiting for the world's slowest elevator, with little by way of a zombie threat to speak of, I was on my way up to the surface.Now, I want to take a second to apologise for Mass Effect 1. Sorry Mass Effect 1, I will never complain about your slow♥♥♥♥♥elevator rides, ever again...Okay, so I got to the surface, dragged myself along with my zimmer frame (because I'd aged by sixty five years by this point) and pushed the button to the door...Loading...Loading...Loading...By this point, I began to ask 'has this shambolic game broken on me?'I waited for eight minutes, checked my phone a few times, rambled to myself about that no good Christine and her constant plotting to undermine me before I eventually sighed, declared that I'm done and figured that it was time to terminate the program.However, before doing this, I clicked the mouse. I do this a lot, during dubious times like this to force a crash, to confirm that that has indeed happened and low and behold, I heard the 'ching' of my Katana, hitting a neaby wall.Yes, this game's ending is a fake loadscreen, that basically acts like the game has crashed in a never ending loading cycle. This game is so♥♥♥♥♥♥ that the game doesn't even have an ending and tries to trick you into thinking that it has a game breaking bug, that stops you from beating it.This game isn't early access and it has a sequel!This game gets a 0/10 for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I wouldn't recommend it, simply, because I find the fact that they couldn't even give us a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ NES text ending.

,Not Recommended,578250,30520317,Posted: 14 March,all,jordan,"(All Categories rated on a 5 star scale)Graphics (★★):Noticeable Unity assets, poor texture quality, and just a dated feel overall. However compared to most first person shooters (or unity asset reliant) games of this price tier, Invention manages to put together a suprisingly cohesive package. Nothing seems out of place,and the unity assets that are present manage to compliment each other instead of conflicting with the scenery. Animations are poor and jittery with little to no transition between actions.Sound/Music (★):You pretty much get what you pay for here. The sound effects range from obnoxiously terrible to passable, while the music amounts to the same lackluster atmospheric track that drones within the background. There are a few times where the music will switch to something more uptempto, but still amounts to generic medicrocity.Gameplay (★★):Invention manages to have a competent inventory system, which hosts various itemsyou'll pick up along the way. Here you can swap between weapons (carrying 2 at a time), put on armor, and assign food/healing items to one of the 4 hotkeys. This is all fine dandy, but the variety of items is severly lacking. The armor you find for example (which is split between a helmet and torso slot) comes in a whopping of 2 different variations for each piece.Furthermore, all weapons and armor degrade over time, although this feature is annoying, it never became too frustating to cause any real issues with the integral flow of the experience. When it comes to the actual combat, shooting is fairly solid, albeit underpowered with the exception of the shotgun. Melee combat feels extremely underwhelming, despite the fact that a few weapons from this category deal a good chunk of damage.Invention also has the player managing 3 different stats at once. The first being the health bar, which was never a concern throughout my entire playthrough of the game. Zombies (which are the only enemy in the game, with a few different variations) deal little to no damage, presenting no challenge whatsover. If for some reason you are low on health you can wait for your health to regenerate, or simply use one of the many healing items you'll come across. The second bar is your stamina, which depletes as you run and can be refilled by waiting or using a stamina-refilling item. The third bar is the most important, your hunger. You grow famished extremely quickly, which is always depleting while playing the game and acclerates when sprinting. To counter this food items must be used to prevent total starvation, which results in the players death. This is a forced mechanic and doesn't fit within the game at all, becoming more of a nuisance than anything else.Invention boils down to killing zombies within similar looking bunker rooms, looting a few items out of containers or dead zombies, hitting the occasional *switch* (aka pressing F on an array of computers) and then making your way to the exit of said level. It's simple stuff, and very easy stuff at that.Story (★):The story is presented within pages you'll find scattered throughout your *adventure*. Basically it's a, *""I crash landed on a island! Oh no there are zombies! I need to escape!""*, plot with an ending so insulting bad (and cheap) you can't help but laugh.Replayability/Length (★):Invention took only 1 hour to complete, and that includes restarting the game once early on due to a bug preventing further access. I can't really recommend playing the game more than once due to the severe lack of content to even push someone to completion once.Overall Score/Recommendation* (★):Invention is a bad game, but Invention is also a ridiculously cheap game. If you want to shoot things mindlessly for an hour with no difficulty then sure purchase Invention for some cheap entertainment. But if you're expecting any sort of depth when it comes to in-game content steer clear.*Not averaged"

,Recommended,578250,29208260,Posted: 12 January,all,MastaCody of 99 Cent Gaming,"I personally purchased this game. I reviewed it for my 99 Cent Gaming series.When I saw this pop up on Steam the day it came out, I was overjoyed to get the chance to review an FPS for my series. I'm a big fan and personally rank the original F.E.A.R. as my most enjoyable experience but have dabbled in many other well known and lesser known titles. All that to say any chance to play an FPS is a chance I love to have....and boy was I happy that I was not disappointed!Invention has a lot of things that could lower players desire to try this out. The cheap entry point, the overdone zombie theme, possibly dated graphics, and a very vague description. While all valid reasons to take your dollar elsewhere should you see fit, I'm here to tell you that all those reasons are also why you should give this a fair shot.I jumped into this game knowing that it was an FPS with RPG elements and had already garnered some good reviews based on the OVERALL: Positive rating on Steam, but that was it. This made me actively look for things in Invention that would cause the overall rating and found, at least for myself, why it was so enjoyable.While the game does start a little slow, it doesn't take too long before you are killing your first deformed zombie-like creature with a shotgun blast to the head. What follows is a very satisfying  run through the secret laboratory picking up a few different weapons to mow down your enemies with. Even though it's not difficult, there's something to be said about feeling like a bad♥♥♥♥♥while destroying any zombies that stand in your way. You face groups from time to time but it doesn't take long to finish them off, allowing you to feel the satisfaction of being both skilled and making progress.To add to that point, I was very pleased to see the developer put in more than a few variations of the weakest zombies in addition to some of the more unique looking ones. It's so easy to put aside the temptation to just copy and paste one or two different looking enemies and call it a day on low-budget games. Not only did I see some very creepy looking deformities, but more than a few different zombies as well. You also encounter some boss-like creatures  fairly soon in the game, but I'll save that for you to discover on your own.Varied enemies, feeling like a badass and constant progress already makes for a fun time, but there's even more to Invention thanks to some RPG elements that are present. Your character can equip armor, put things like health kits and food items on a hot key menu, collect keys to open doors, and pick up notes that help to flesh out the game's story. Since my first impression play through lasted about 30 minutes I did not get the chance to see how well the armor came into play, but again there wasn't a moment in Invention that I felt at risk of dying and managed to make it to THE level 4/2 before stopping my run. There was a moment that my character was starving but only because I neglected to feed him from the onset and it was never an issue from that point.From what I played, I felt like the RPG elements slightly took away from things I was enjoying. For starters you have the ability to search crates and bodies, but more often than not I found nothing in them and more things out in the open (SO MANY SHOTGUN SHELLS) causing me to wish there were less pick ups scattered around the various rooms. Trust me, there is no lack of ammo in this game.You also have your own inventory screen that houses your items which works well enough until you start using up your ammo causing spaces in your inventory to appear. I know this is common in other RPGs that use this type of inventory system, but the notes you pick up also go in your inventory. Not only do they take up space but if you pick one up when you have an empty slot that comes before the earlier notes you picked up, you are left looking through each on trying to figure out which one you haven't read yet because they all have the same icon. This was frustrating and made me wish the developer added a button that allowed you to reorganize the inventory in one click.Finally, something that I've seen becoming more of a cliche since I've started these reviews...the grammar. When reading the notes it is very obvious that someone should have been asked to check over how things were worded before Invention was released. While I've learned to find the charm of bad scripts in low-budget titles, I hope after seeing feedback on the the dev can find some time (or someone) to touch up the notes.Overall, I can say that Invention was enjoyable for the time I and money I put into it. Does the RPG-lite elements add a lot to the overall package? In my opinion...no. Does the overall gameplay make up for the issues I had with it? Absolutely. I walked away from my review wanting to play more and discover what other unique zombies I would face, how deep this laboratory goes, and continue feeling like a bad♥♥♥♥♥I have more to say about the game in my video below, but my final verdict on whether Invention is worth the .99 it asks for: completely. I believe you won't be disappointed if only for the FPS side of it all. And who knows? After some inventory optimization and some script clean up, the RPG side of it could be just as good. Now I'm off to go kill off some more zombies!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsIwKQLSpDw"

My only criticisms are the slightly broken english throughout the game (although it isn't too severe), the somewhat unoriginal and uninspired story, and the fact that it is not much of a scary game at all.

It doesnt feel like a modern FPS.The game is very short and the overall plot is uninspired, but I'm OK with that. I've played worse and I kinda like basic concepts. The only replay value is trying to complete the game faster each time.You may find bugs throughout your gameplay; I found two.Overall, I'd say you definately got what you bought. For its price, the game is fine and I can't say I didn't have an OK time playing it. It's like exploring a dangerous but inviting territory of hidden gems: you can find masterpieces, you may run into some regular stuff like this, and you can run into pieces of faecal matter!"

,Not Recommended,578250,33926020,Posted: 31 July,all,Dax Bane,"This game, for an indie, is a good start however various glitches and missing UI/UX elements that detract significantly from the enjoyability of this game. While not - for the most part - showstoppers, the detractions that I've discovered thus far are as follows:- Molasses-like movement with noticable backlash; namely you are still moving forward/sideways upto a full second after releasing the key- Burning stamina just by having shift held down without pressing any other key- The logic behind being able to jump on top of a barrel to cross over a barrier but can't jump over a desk or bed?- Inability to move or even climb over environmental objects such as chairs and overturned shelving (can't even jump over them to get from point A to point B)- The player can jump, but can't duck makes little if any sense at all- minimal input configuration options; all you can configure is key bindings, no mouse settings whatsoever so the players who, like myself, prefer having inverted Y-axis (pull back to look up) are out of luckand the coup-de-gras:- Despite being unable to jump over beds, chairs, and overturned shelving, one can still jump on the basin in the Bunker Level 1 bathroom, run along the top of the stalls and (now the showstopper) get stuck in either the second or third stall with absolutely no way to get out.That last one, coupled with all the other glitches, was the ""even at the discount it wasn't worth the spend"" moment for me, this game should have remained in beta status before being unleashed upon is. It is a promising start, devs, but it is far from finished or polished"
76561198046562058,Not Recommended,578250,34179870,Posted: 11 August,all,CrownRoyal578,"The usual response to any negative review of an indie game is ""what did you expect for 99 cents""?  To be honest, I expected something that would be at least moderately fun and would give me maybe 5 hours of enjoyment.What I got was 20 minutes of frustration and a great deal of relief when it was over.  In short, this is not a game - this is a bad hand job.Rather than highlight the numerous generic and derivative zombies that you will encounter, I will instead focus on the 3 most relentless, ruthless, and annoying enemies that you must overcome to accomplish your daunting objective (using a radio):1)  Invisible wallsUnlike ordinary walls, invisible walls cannot be seen.  Also unlike ordinary walls, invisible walls serve absolutely no purpose.  Rather, they demonstrate that the programmer could not be bothered to construct, say, a rock wall, or even a pile of rocks.  They also limit your ability to explore and find additional resources.  Curious if that truck contains ammo for your rifle?   Wondering if that stack of boxes might hold some first aid kits?  Sorry - there is an invisible wall between you and it.   That's right - the developer put in stacks of boxes, military-style trucks, and even some watchtowers, but you will not get to most of them.  The invisible wall shall bar your path, and it knows no mercy.2)  The Work RoomClearly, a great deal of work gets done in the bunker where most of this game takes place.  I base this deduction solely upon the fact that 90% of the doors are labeled ""Work Room"".  Some are locked,  Some will never open.  Some contain mission-critical keys or passcodes.  But you will never tell them apart, because they are all identical.  Perhaps this was due to budget cuts at Evil Zombie Manufacturing, Inc.  Perhaps there was a sale at Work Room Door Emporium, Airport, and Haircare.  We may never know.3)  The TapewormThe Tapeworm is with you in the beginning, and it will be with you in the end.  It will be your constant companion, your one rock upon which to lean.  It will never give you up, let you down, or desert you.  Truly, The Tapeworm is forever.You see, unlike most other shooters which are content with a life meter, Invention decided to go above and beyond.  They added a stamina meter, which makes some sense.  They then added a hunger meter, which makes no sense whatsoever.  And not just any hunger meter.  This, my friends, is The Tapeworm.  And The Tapeworm must be fed.  Seriously, about every 2 minutes you had better find something to eat.  Be it energy bars (not weird), a biscuit in a bag (sorta weird), a can of mystery stew (getting weirder), or a large hunk of uncooked sausage sitting on a table amongst the gore-splattered walls and chunk-filled floor (so weird it defies all logic), you MUST eat.  Not since the arcade classic, Gauntlet, has the ""need to feed"" been such a critical part of game.   However, Invention doesn't showcase a ever-present voice stating ""GENERIC PROTAGONIST NEEDS FOOD BADLY!"".  I wish it had.  It would have added some much needed humor.  Pac-Man ate less.   I honestly finished the game with 6 spare first aid kits.....and a hunger meter at 10%.  Because, naturally, nothing gets your appetite going like blowing away reanimated corpses in a poorly-ventilated underground bunker.  But The Tapeworm does not care.  The Tapeworm demands that you eat that shank of raw pork that you found in an operating room where two zombies were feasting on a human corpse.  You live or die at the pleasure of The Tapeworm.In conclusion, don't waste your money.  No, not even 99 cents.  Not even less if you get a magical coupon as I did.  Unless you want to give it to a friend as a gift.  Preferably, to a friend you don't mind losing."
