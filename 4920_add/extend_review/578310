,Recommended,578310,30230100,Posted: 27 February,all,UPRC,"A lot like a more realistic version of Soldat. Less silly stuff like jetpacks and health kits, and more fast kills and stealth. If you liked Soldat, you'll like BRAIN / OUT."
76561198055879714,Recommended,578310,30154833,Posted: 24 February,all,✪TakeMeToYourDealer✪,"Brain/Out is a 2D screen scrolling shooter where you can play a small selection of game modes with and against other players. If you remember the days of 'Pawn', you'll recognise a very similar game here. Featured within the game is a decent arsenal of weapons, from the AS VAL and AK12 to the M1911 and SPAS-12, as well as various options for equipment including C4 and a Barricade Tool/Builder, and a choice of perks, from running faster to carrying a little more ammo.Today being the game's debut, it somewhat lacks in variety of maps and gamemodes, although this is understandable. You have your standard Deathmatch (Free For All), Team Deathmatch, and a mode similar to CoD's Domination, or Battlefield's Conquest where you must hold three points and beat the other team for points. The maps are interesting, with some breakable windows and plenty of ladders, but nothing too extravagant. What stands out however is that the game is a lot harder than it looks on the surface. You won't be able to see any enemies until they are in your line of sight, or if you have just recently seen them. So be careful descending that ladder, or you could suddenly bump into a couple of angry foes. As well as this, guns are very lethal, and you'll only be able to survive a couple of hits at most. This keeps things interesting and challenging, as you could be returning fire on the shooter across the screen, to run for cover, then you'll be ambushed by another enemy and killed very quickly. It's a game which punishes you for not thinking before you act.The weapons are nicely varied and you have a selection of firearms to choose from, but from the start you'll have unlocked the Makarov Pistol, TOZ-34 Shotgun, AKS-74U Carbine, and the MP5 SMG. They allow for a bit of experimentation at the start which is great, since you don't want to be stuck at the start of a multiplayer experience with maybe two useless weapons. All the weapons I've used so far have played very well and realistically, with the sole exception of the TOZ-34. This shotgun is not treated like any of the other shotguns which fire pellets. This one fires slugs, and so it fires one accurate projectile at a time. It's horrendously accurate at that, so it's an early game AWP essentially. I cannot say if this is due to unbalance or keeping in the hardcore nature of the game. Otherwise the gunplay is good and really what makes the game.You also have your equipment selection which lets you bring in gear like a Flashbang, or two Grenades, or maybe even an Ammo Box or Medkit. You also have a kind of building tool, which lets you place sandbags. They are affected by gravity and won't stand still in midair, but they can be stuck to walls to be used as a ladder. You can also create an improvised bunker from them. It's an interesting feature I've seen in a few games, but it has high potential for exploitation. You also have a slot for perks, which are rather run-of-the-mill in any shooter - run faster, shoot better, more ammo, tougher, etc. Nothing unusual but it allows for a bit more options in combat.The weapons themselves can be upgraded with several attachments, but they are preset and unique for that weapon, so there's not a huge range for customisation. Along with this you can upgrade the base stats of the weapon, so you can shoot more accurately, reload faster, and such. You can unlock more for your weapon by using it more, and some weapons can only be unlocked by using others, ie. 120 M4A1 kills gets you the SCAR. It's a good way of encouraging the player to try other weapons out instead of sticking to the same one forever. Weapon skins are also available, but must be unlocked through a crate drop.Now this is the part that might turn some people off - but the game will drop a few crates at the end of the match. They can be opened for free and can contain things like bonus XP and Scrap for repairing and upgrading weapons you use a lot, but you can also get Golden Crates for real money. THANKFULLY, they only tend to drop stuff in the Standard crate, with a high chance for better items such as player and weapon skins. It's not a game breaker by any means, but if you enjoy the game enough and want to try and get a fancy new character skin (STALKER's Cheeki Breeki tracksuit Bandit and Jacket from Hotline Miami are two of the several skins), then I would suggest it's worth the $0.99 (£0.79).Lastly you have a trophy system where you can pick up enemy weapons and it will add them to your trophy collection - this is cool since it's also very similar to the Battlefield Tag collecting idea, and you can scrap trophies you don't want to keep in your collection for more scrap, useful for weapon upgrades and repairs. Trophies will also include the name of the player they belong to so it works as a bragging rights table if you have a lot of trophies.Other than this I think I have covered most of what I have experienced in my first day of playing this game. I would recommend it to people who enjoy side-scrolling shooters and are looking for a challenging F2P multiplayer game. Currently free of P2W and hopefully it stays like that, as it is definitely a fun game to kill some time."

Deathmatch is god awful.. that being said i enjoy the line of sight physics and being able to use allies line of sight.    If the Devs realize what they have here and maybe get a little more help to work on the game they could really turn this into something big.    The maps leave room for some great capture the point games  which in my opinion is the shining star of the game.I definately recommend the game as its free, and addicting to open skin crates. (the skins are actually very well done for a 2d sidescrolling shooter)Their is a weapon durability system that inputs weapon lock into the game.  i think weapon lock is the most stupid rng possibly to add into what is a great skillshooter team game.

,Recommended,578310,30236204,Posted: 28 February,all,inception,"After playing the game for quite some time I've decided to make a review. Lets start with the gunplay. The mechanics are pretty solid, you can just hop in a server with any gun and get some kills no problem. They do need to integrate some weapon balancing and Line of Sight issues but the game is great overall. The weapon challenges and skins you can get (Just by playing the game) is great. You dont have to put a single dollar into the game and you can recieve player skins for your character model, as well as in-game weapon skins which look pretty great. As you go leveling up you unlock more weapons to use to your liking. There is a more tactical side to this game its not just a point and click as it seems. Once they polish a few things they should add a ranked mode. That would give the game meaning and make it more enjoyable to play. Overall the game is pretty well made for the state that it's in. Grab some friends and hop on and slaughter each other. Absolutely recommend. 10/10"
,Recommended,578310,30203855,Posted: 26 February,all,Rice,This game is a plesant suprise.I played with a few friends for almost an entire day and we had an aboslute blast.It's balanced pretty well (Except for the ♥♥♥♥ing sniper shotgun that is the TOZ)and the gameplay is satisfying. Jumping off a roof and headshotting someone is legitimatly fun.I thought that the game would be dead and it's not really alive because its in a >1000 player range.I'd say grab it and Grab some buddies.TOZ nerf pls.

And literally anyone can be good at it. The only problem I find is that sometimes your enemy will go invisible and you can't see him which makes it unfair. Also sometimes when I am trying to press ready to respawn, it minimzes the window, I would like it if it was just an automatic 5 sec respawn. Without having to click anything (unless your switching weapons). I'd also like a little like guideline of the rating system in the game its confusing. If this were to be fixed, I'd give a full 10/10 for this game."

,Recommended,578310,30147140,Posted: 24 February,all,Arylade,"Brain / Out is a fast paced, 2D shooter set in a post-apocalyptic styled environment.Holy damn this is a great shooter. There's so many modern weapons that you can customize to improve their stats, but the real wins come from you and you alone. You start off with 3 guns: an assault rifle, SMG, and a shotgun (this shotgun appears to fire a slug, effectively making it a sniper rifle). The shotgun mechanics are fantastic (some of them you actually have to pump after firing) and there is a variety of explosives and slight perks to take with you into battle. There are microtransactions ($1.30 chest & $0.64 chest), which just give XP, weapon parts, and weapon skins. In no way do these chests offer an unfair advantage that P2W games have.There are some bugs but that's expected since it was just released today.Highly recommend!10/10"

The pros and cons are going to be listed here.Pros-No Pay to Win system. Each gun does almost identical damage and pretty much all you need to worry about is which one looks the coolest and which one is the most accurate.-The art style is rather original, and captures a drab wartime environment better than many I have seen.-It's a lot of fun to play, and addictive.Cons-Plagarism! Lots of textures and sounds are stolen from different video games and movies. For instance, the P90 firing sound is the same used by the HL2 SMG. Also, the brick textures are ripped from Terraria.-Before you say this con is useless due to the 'gun jam' system, it is not. There is a glitch in which guns that cannot jam will suddenly stop firing, even with ammo loaded into them.- 7 1/4 out of 10. Memelord the Muffin"

The progression system is very nice and there are a wide selection of guns and gear.Great F2P too, Microtransactions are very reasonably priced and seem to be mainly cosmetics. You actually have to earn all the guns for free, unless I'm missing something. You can also get free crates by winning rounds and participating in daily challenges.Never seen noticable lag even on 100+ ping servers.Really solid movement and shooting mechanics, super low TTK. Sadly can make the game a bit campy but campers are easily dealt with.Some maps don't have the best layout but overall most of them are nice. They look really easy to make so hopefully we'll get a lot or be able to make our own.A little rough but with some polish this could really be a gem."

The game takes a skill based shooter and turns it into a side scroller, making you use another, less stressful, form of strategy. While being fun and not stressful, it still takes some tactical thinking. If you like CS:GO or any shooter really, you'll love BRAIN / OUT."
,Recommended,578310,30250446,Posted: 28 February,all,Mr Nick,"This game is hands-down the best game of its type that I have ever played. The game sounds very simple, but infact, it isn't. I really recommend you just play it to understand, but here is a short summary just in-case you want to know: it is a 2-d platformer shooter. Each player can see enemies when they are facing them and there are no obstructions between them, and they can also see them if they fire an unsuppressed weapon. Teammates can see enemies that you see, as well. This makes for some very interesting gameplay. You can get the drop on unsuspecting enemies by using your senses. Perhaps sneak up behind an enemy who is locked in a gunfight with a teammate? Or maybe sneak up on that one guy camping? Hell, you could just go in guns-a-blazing and get the enemy team's head's down(or even put a round IN a couple of dude's head's), so that your team can flank and kill them. Equiptment such as grenades and medkits are also available to spice things up a bit. Oh, and do be careful. You can only carry a large gun, a pistol, equiptment, a knife, and ammo for your guns. So, be careful not to spray randomly when you see a guy, or use more than half a clip when suppressing that one camper♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is one of those games with few mechanics, but the game's mechanics are central to the gameplay. If you do not outsmart your enemy using your wits and outgun him with a strategicly picked weapon, you will not do very well(unless you are just amazingly fast, then you might do OK). So you see, the game is very well thought out and easy in theory, but hard in practice. This is one of those games that is actually tactical. I love it because it is exhilerating and is more of a ""tactical game"" than a ""strategy game."" I say this because in every top-down strategy game I play, I lose badly, because it is just too large scale, with too many things to look after on one screen, and things like weapon choice and highly specific movement don't really matter. But in every tactical game like this, I am a master. I can predict enemy movements, pick my weapon according to teammate and enemy playstyle/weapon choice/position/movements(and also pick them correctly because I happen to be VERY knowledgable when it comes to firearms), and always get the drop on unsuspecting enemies. I do not write reviews often, but this game has me pumped. I really recommend it, because you don't have to have ANY money or that much skill, you just need quick wits. Oh, and another thing: some of you may be wondering if there are any pay to win aspects. Yes, there are, but not really. I haven't really seen anyone who had much of an advantage. And I won anyway, so, yeah. Don't worry about pay to win stuff in this game. Anyway, I sure do hope I led you to become addicted to this game, because I sure as hell am, but in a good way. Developers: please do keep up the good work, the game is amazing and you guys know how to make money without losing any players. I tip my hat to you. Thank you all for reading this long, and I hope to see you in-game!"
