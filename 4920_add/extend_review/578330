,Recommended,578330,32226801,Posted: 6 June,all,Kaldaien,"Fair Warning:I previously left a negative review for performance problems. I addressed the biggest ones and am happy to suggest this game now.Unmodified, this game cannot be run in fullscreen mode. At launch it shipped with a fullscreen mode, but if you were to alt+tab your entire computer would become unusable. Rather than fix this the right way (I don't know if TT even understands the cause of the problem), they just disabled the feature altogether. That is the level of commitment you can expect from them on technical matters :-\Technical problems aside, this game is packed full of content. It's basically the ideal LEGO game, oodles of extra non-story related content to unlock in a fairly large open world. It's like the Marvel Superheroes game, only without the silly superheroes :)I have changed my review to a thumbs-up, but this is only because of a mod that I wrote (look for it in the guides section).Given TT's commitment to the game, consider looking for this game when it's on sale. If you have problems with the game you won't be getting any support from them, and $40 might be a tough pill to swallow."

Playing multiplayer seems to really bring it out. My daughter and I can't get more than about 30 min of play before it locks up or crashes.  Hopefully it gets some of the normal TT game love and these issues get resolved sooner rather than later.

76561198087781363,Recommended,578330,32694702,Posted: 23 June,all,Samed,"This game is without a doubt the best of the LEGO games. The story was funny and entertaining and I quite enjoyed the game's colorful characters. The gameplay is similar to that of other LEGO games, but I found the combat much more enjoyable than in other titles within the series. The game is not overly challenging, but some puzzles were a bit tricky and you will get stumped at some points if you're going for 100% completion. The levels are engaging and interesting as well as quite diverse in terms of setting and goals. Finally, the open-world is quite nice, as LEGO city provided an engrossing and visually appealing setting for a diverse set of puzzles and tasks.Overall, the game itself is amazing, but there are a few issues. As others have mentioned, the game does have performance issues and the frequent crashes can be frustrating. However, after numerous patches, the crashes have occurred far less than before although the game still crashes on occasion. Additionally, it is annoying that one of the Red Brick cheats is not usable on keyboard if you have custom key-binds (which are a necessity given the ineffective default key-bindings). Besides those small issues this game is really fun and the negative reviews should not discourage one from purchasing this game especially if it is on sale. If I can run the game on my awful computer with minimal issues it should be perfectly fine for most everyone else."

Ruining the review score, even though they released a fix for the game hours(maybe) later. I figured I'd try to help undo some of the damage that has been done.Now, onto the game itself:Smooth performance, great gameplay, simple mechanics. Simple as that. I always enjoy simple.I remember playing the old lego city games on PC as a kid, and I think these games were VERY old, this game reminds me of how much fun they were."

When kids play it, they have fun.Technically speaking, it is not a gem; but again, it is a lego game; and I did play other lego games, which they all look mostly the same. Some lag here and there, due to poor optimizations, but in the end, a 10 year old won't really make a fuss out of it.The story is fun to play; it is a GTA clone for kids; and I like that the violence level is kept to a minimum, so you can let kids enjoy the game, withouth the need to worry. I did like more the console version, but the PC version is not that bad either.The game as is, barely reach 5; but if you are a 10 year old; this game value is much closer to a 8."

While that was true when the bugs were still in the game, the developers have fixed near all game breaking bugs. The game all around is amazing, it is basically GTA if it were to be in the lego universe. It has Free Roam, the ability to take cars at random, an expansive world to explore as well as many things to do inside too. I'd like to shine light on this good game while most of the reviews on steam have come down harshly on it due to the bugs that are no longer in the game. I give this game a solid 8/10, and has to be probably the best lego game to date."

Because its a crash-fest. I got 9-10 crashes on the course of 24 hours, fortunately I am already at 55% progress. God knows how many crashes I still owe to this game. If you wanna buy this game, wait for sale or at least untill the dev release a patch for the crashes. For performance, I only have CTD problem, the game run smoothly at 60 fps.Pros;- Big world consists of several districts, each with its own themes.- You can ride trains.- Good graphic for a Lego game, please dont compare it to other games, cause this game wont stand a chance in term of graphic if you compare it, but among other Lego games, its pretty good.- Lots of challenges to do.Cons:- Crash, crash, crash and crash. Among other games with horrible port, this one gives me the most crashes- Too many useless collectibles, reminds me of AC Unity.- Unskipable cutscenes, this is blasphemy.- Flying with chicken is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥If you are a fan of Lego game, this worth a try, but only when its on sale or until the dev fix the crash problem.

That mixed in with the SImpsons Hit and Run is best comparison that comes to mind. The writing's also suprisingly very funny and it's clear this was made with an older audience in mind as it's riddled with movie and music references. 10/10 in my book."
,Recommended,578330,30983427,Posted: 6 April,all,Pajama Samuel™,"The Good:Lego City Undercover follows a 1980's-ish cop trying to bring a criminal to justice....again.  Lego has included multiple references to shows and movies which are parodied in a way only lego can.  The voice acting is great, allowing an immersive experience in a cheesy 1980s action plot.  The city is fairly large, offering a surprising amount of freedom and exploration.  Many have likened this to GTA, and they would not be wrong, assuming GTA had a rating of E for everyone.The Bad:There is only one difficulty setting: 5 years and under.  This makes the game feel more like a walk through (firewatch comes to mind) than an actual game at times, with no challenge ever arising which needs any level of skill, other than the basic coordination a toddler would possess.The performance of this game is unusually demanding for a lego game.  Considering the nonadjustable draw distance is set to a default which should be called ""console low"", it is a CPU hog.  I opted to play in 4k instead of 1440p, as the frame rate did not differ when using the 4690k and a gtx 1080.   At either resolution, i max out at 90 in many areas, with 120 fps being achievable in few areas or when looking at the sky/ground.The Ugly:There is a notorious bug, giving you a screen of death, when changing the resolution.  There is no possible way this could have made it through a competent QC team, which leaves me wondering if there was one at all, or if they just did not care to fix it.The game loves to remind you that the default refresh rate is 60 hz.  For whatever reason, when starting the game, it defaults back to a 60 fps cap. every. single. time.EDIT: 4-7-17: There has been a patch pushed out which fixed the gamebreaking bugs i mentioned above.All in All:Lego nails it again with a creative and immersive experience in a world that is kid friendly, yet seems to transcend the ""kid trope"" and entertain adults of all ages.  Due to the unpolished nature of the game, however, this lego game is recieving (rightfully so) criticism.  We need to praise developers when they do great, and hold their feet to the fire when they do not.  Right now, this game is, for me, a borderline recommend.  If they, however, push out a patch to fix the issues i have mentioned, this game will rise to be one of the strongest lego titles available on steam.EDIT: 4-7-17: There has been a patch pushed out which fixed the gamebreaking bugs i mentioned above. This game is now a strong recommend."

All you really need for this game to access it easily is a controller with an adapter to your computer. This game is great, I'm having great fun playing it, and I have finished the story line.

LEGO games have always expected you to replay them in ""free play"" mode, which gives you access to areas you cannot get to in the main story by using characters you unlock later on.  LEGO City Undercover is no exception and going back once the story is complete means you can see and do even more.  Add to that the open world with activities around every corner and there is a lot of play time here.My 4 year old loves playing it with me, and now knows which characters can do what and can even play on his own and have fun.  He might not be achieving very much, but there is so much to do in any given area that he will always have fun, and that's the point, right?I highly recommend this for family play.  As I said, my 4 year old loves it, and we had a friend visit with their 11 and 13 year olds and they had an absolute blast mucking around in the city.  As a gamer I can also appreciate the wealth of activities and a few of them are a challenge even for older players.I understand from some of the reviews/news that there were issues on launch, but I have seen none of that and it has all worked perfectly for me.If you just want to have fun, then get this and you won't be disappointed."

It is your thypical LEGO game, and if you've played one before, you'll be pleased to know that it lives up to the gameplay and joy that all lego games i've played seem to bring.It sounds great, doesn't it? Does it sound like an easy decision? Well, I wish I could tell you that it is, because it's a much harder decision than what first might seem.To be quick about it, If you've got a gaming console like the Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, or XBOX, you'd be smarter to get it on one of those consoles. In fact, I've got a Nintendo Switch, and I wish I had known about the many problems this game had before I invested, but it was only after not being able to start the game for the first 24 hours after I installed it, that I took to google to see what was wrong. I'd suggest for you to do the same, because apparently there are a lot of people with different problems that prevent them from starting the game.I was ready to refund it, but the next day, I tried starting it again in a desperate attempt, and infact, it booted up without problem.Now when I've played it, I can say that as I write this, I can't wait to play it again. So, if  LEGO games are for you, this is to me a must-buy. But if you can't start the game after installing it, or if there's some other obnoxious glitch, be sure to use the REFUND option on Steam, and perhaps get it on a console instead."

You don't want to skip them as they will have you laughing out  loud and they make you like the characters even more.Only complaint is the layou of the controls if you use the keyboard - may be instinctive if you're a squid with small tentacles but you learn to, if not love them, put up with them.

There's a lot to do, hundreds of characters to find (although I mostly collect them to unlock their pieces for the custom characters), a lot of unique vehicles to gather (I don't see how you can go around in a wheelchair in GTA) and a plethora of other collectibles. The driving's good, the story is a lot of fun, being a satire on the stereotypes of police movies and books that's good for more than just kids (in fact, I'm willing to bet an adult would find this more fun than a kid), and the combat system is decent enough(very fun throwing mooks around, although fighting's still♥♥♥♥♥♥easy like in every lego game, and this time around you can't just hit anyone on the streets, a mediocre decision in my opinion).The reason of the huge ammount of bad reviews (and, mind you, it is a valid reason) is the horrible state of this game when it was first released. You couldn't even change the resolution, or use the steam overlay (the game would crash if you tried). The developers released a day-one patch fixing these two issues, and then another one fixing a bunch of other problems, and they're bound to release more. I appreciate it, but honestly, all of these fixes should have been done before releasing the game. That would certainly have improved the overall score here in steam.I'd say right now, the game's very worthwhile. I haven't experienced the issues everyone is apparently still complaining about, I can boot up the game just fine, the stuttering happens rarely (certainly not twice per minute) and I've experienced only three or four crashes since I bought the game (and I never lost much progress, thanks to the autosave feature).

I would give this a good review but I can't play it yet so I have no idea if it good or not cause I know the controls are different since it on wii u and PC I'm kind of mad about paying for an expensive game you can't play feel like I got scammed a bit you know? even worse is when I did try to play twice I could not get out of the mini corner game screen thumbnail that shown up sound was alright when it finally launch after a long wait in download time and sadly had to force shut down my computer to get out of it no ESC key could not help me or etc to quite manually so deciding it didn't download right I uninstalled waited another few hours for it to download hoped it fixed the problem and yet again to my annoyance same problem. I hope this gets fixed cause I heard good things about this game and had hoped to share the experience with family but right now it could do better I know it can.

To accomplish this you have to solve simple puzzles, collect LEGO® pieces, rebuild the city with them and advance the story to unlock different powers. The gameplay consists of the standard LEGO® games formula, except there is not as much action as in LEGO® Batman (fighting bad guys with your fists), which is the other LEGO® game I own.Is it a fun relaxing game? Yes! Will the kids humor make you cringe as an adult player? Absolutely! Can you look past this? Yes - most of the time, when it's not super in your face. Besides, I enjoyed some of the jokes.Unfortunately it is borderline unplayable due to many game breaking bugs and random crashes. Some reviewers stated that this game is supposed to be fixed. If this is the case, I am glad I didn't see an earlier state of it. All in all I can't recommend it due to it's technical state and pricing of 29,99 € or your regional equivalent.I have mentioned earlier that I own LEGO® Batman aswell. I played it on the XBOX 360 and there were a lot of technical issues, especially with the sound. After my recent experiences with LEGO® CITY Undercover, I won't buy a LEGO® game again. In case you are wondering why I emphasize the brand LEGO® so much: I think they have the financial resources to deliver better products - as one of the most succesful companies in their business sector - and it's a shame they didn't."

It's been great fun - the voice acting is superb, and the jokes are great.(""Why would you want to steal *that* painting?"", ""It's a Brickasso!"", ""Oh.  Looks like a face to me""). The gameplay is classic lego - Missions off a hub world consisting of simple little puzzles and minigames piled on top of one another in one great lovable heap.  The driving element is very well executed, and you can do some quite spectacular short cuts once you've found your way around the city - don't always rely on your Satnav.However - the game *is* bugged -  I've had a couple of crash-to-desktops, unfortunately normally on a transition - which also normally means it's at the *end* of a trip across the map.  Thankfully the saves have been preserved, and you only have to do the last bit of the journey again - but it's still an annoyance.  There is a user-supplied mod available (See the 'guides' page) that allows you to tweak the graphics settings (which appears to be the source of the issue), and it also removes the FPS cap, if such things bother you.  It does seem to have also made some stability improvements.If you're used to the later Lego games, you'll find this one doesn't hand-hold you quite as much.  There's a few elements that you have to definitely figure out for yourself, but it's no worse for that(If you haven't already, try shooting as a farmer.  Go on.)I got it in the Steam summer sale 2017 for about £15, and I consider it well worth the money.  The crashes were infrequent, and appear to have stopped with the installation of the mod.In summary - tad buggy, but full of juicy lego goodness for both adults and kids.Set your ringtone to 'Belch' in the extras menu.
