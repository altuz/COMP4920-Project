76561198020132902,Recommended,578620,33549893,Posted: 14 July,all,dreadlord720,"had gorn for 2 days now and heres how those 2 days have gone:Day 1: Booted up the game excited for my first taste of a gladiator type vr experience. Went through the first few waves of unarmed opponents with little trouble, even grabbing my opponents and ripping their heads from their still living bodies all to please the crowd of omnipotent floating heads around me quoting Gladiator the whole way through. The night ended with my eyes burning from the profuse sweat i had started producing and I decide even the best gladiators need sleep so i proceeded to get some rest.Day2: After the intense combat of day 1 i felt like i had been hit by a train, but the arena called to me. I started carving my way through the meat sacks once again, facing harder and harder rounds each time. Instead of trying to please the crowd, i now have a deep seeded hatred for them and their ""king"" and i use that hatred and anger to fuel my berserk fighting rampages. once again i have ended the night drenched in sweat and will likely be unable to move tomorrow.Overall this has to be one of the best vr games in existence. I have never hated a floating head that doesnt speak/barely speaks as much as i have in this game but that anger just makes it that much better when i rip the head from their ""champions"" shoulders then throw the remains at them. If you have any exercise equipment you wont need it anymore. YOU WILL SWEAT and YOU WILL EXPERIENCE BLOODLUST. 10/10 best vr game ever."

,Recommended,578620,33567597,Posted: 15 July,all,"David ""TheDave"" Eastwick","Gorn -The arena fighting game we have always wanted but never knew it!So ever since i brought Gorn on a passionate recommendation from a colleague of mine i have been somewhat addicted and since i stream and it is not uncommon for me to commentate while streaming “I just pulled his leg off and beat him to death with it” my neighbours have been crossing the street to avoid me.Now it is worth remembering what the term Gorn means, it is an amalgamation of Gore and porn, blood for the sake of blood, violence for violence sake, this is NOT a game for kids, given its VR and you are actually pulling off people's heads and bashing out brains with rocks,  i really should not have to state that but we live in an age where parents think “hey it’s a game, must be kid friendly” ….no do not let little timmy play this :)Ok so you are an adult, you know the difference between reality and games? Good then look, you can read the rest of the review, i want you to, it took time to write after all, but you know what...just go buy the game, you will love it!I have always loved arena games from Shadow of Rome to the tiny arena mini game in ps3’s move sports and when i first stepped into VR my initial thought was “This needs an arena game!” although there has been attempts at it this is the first one i have found hard to put down.How hard to put down? Well in a live stream on thursday i caught my knuckle on a table, blood everywhere (remember to clear your VR area folks) a few hours latter despite not having full use of that finger i was back streaming for another 2 hour session.At the end of every game of it i am drenched in sweat (and my “day” job means i am an active person no couch potato here) so it also doubles as a fitness game.ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT / GRAPHICSThe arena is a fair size and you have to love the giant heads watching you lol, the actual art style is leaning towards cartoony, teamfortress 2 like (again not for kids) with some really well done gore effects (they are deeply impressive)The weapons have some bizarre qualities (almost rubbery at times, until you use them) which adds to the game, it is amusing to hold a spear one handed and seeing it flop limp like a flaccid ...well ok you can see where that analogy is going ;) (remember this game is not for kids ...neither is this review)While some would argue that they may wish to see new arenas, personally i feel the one we have is perfect for this game.PERFORMANCEI have had moments where the physics have wigged out and things have flown strangely or stretched out, mostly this is a cause of amusement (though often resulting in your ingame death) but on rare occasions it has caused the frame rate or game to freeze for a few seconds. This however is rare and the game recovers beautifully from it.The only other issue is that in the latest build i lost the ability to loose arrows, instead they drop to the floor, an issue i hope the developer notes and fixes soon (is reported)INTUITIVENESSYou beat them to death before they beat you to death….i mean it is fairly intuitive.The one downside is that whenever you load it your movement is defaulted to arm swing motion (a god awful movement system where you hold the touch pad and swing your arm to move) and you have to make your way to the options board to set it to the better touchpad locomotion (The dev clearly loves arm swing motion and it did take persuading for us to get an option added).PROS:Very addictiveYou can tear off a man’s arm and beat him to death with it.you can kneel down and stick a finger up at an enemy that has no arms, one leg and its rolling towards you with menace. (yep monty python jumps to my mind to, Tis but a flesh wound)A good sense of progression, unlocking new weapons by using the others a certain amount of times, enemies get harder and you unlock bosses.A developer that listens to his users (so long as you are not asking for new movement...though even there he did listen after a while) and adds things in like demo mode so your mates can try the game without having to face the waves of now peeved, leveled enemies who are waiting for you to log back in so they can have a quiet word about how you pulled their mate George’s head off and bashed in fred’s skull with it.An endless mode that is a see how long you can last type deal where the enemies get steadily better equipped (best mode in the game in my opinion)Strange and challenging Boss fights (with the tease that more will be added)You WILL get a good workout if played properly.I guarantee there will at least one moment where you pull off something so amazing that you will wish you were recordingMore than fair price.CONS:The bow bug, it is really annoying and the developer seems to be ignoring it or not responding on topics about it.The endless mode has to be unlocked and yet is the most fun mode.Certain weapons like the throwing knives(awesome weapon) do not appear in Endless modeIf you are not physically fit or not into getting a workout this may not be for you.Can get VERY hard.Explaining to a mate on the phone how you threw the throwing knife into one guys head while bashing the skull in of a guy with a mace still clutched in the hands of his friends severed arm, will get you strange looks from other people on the bus no matter how quiet you talk….i dread to think what government watch lists i may be on due to my gaming habbits.VIDEO:This is one of those games where video does not do it justice, that said here is a tiny clip (you can find full videos of it on my twitch channel, should you wish to)https://clips.twitch.tv/OutstandingAbstruseMushroom4HeadVERDICTOwn VR? Over 18? Buy Gorn.I really love the game and can not recommend it highly enough."

You are a gladiator against several waves of enemies each round and unlock various weapons throughout your battles by doing little achievements (kill 10 enemies with mace, etc...)  Limb, physics, and parry mechanics are all awesome.  Game is definitly a workout to play but very fun in short bursts.  locomotion takes some getting used to but once you figure it out you can roam around the arena without issue.I'm a big fan of games like Warband, Chivalry, Of Kings and Men, etc... and this is just great.

Fighting never gets boring because the weapons and the mechanics are so smooth, the Enemy AI is perfectly suited for VR, and everythig works together so well. Despite being in early access, it redefines the phrase ""made from the ground up,"" primarily because you can tell the developers actually thought through each and every little part of the game. I'm left breathless after each fight not only because I've been tearing the faces off of guys who skip leg day, but also because I've just had that much fun.P.S. The trailer isn't a joke.

Room furnitures, if they are also shattered in the process.Edit: I didn't watch the new trailer, it shows that. Great one.Awesome game, but watch out.Players need to carefully learn how to manage real space in VR world. I didn't try to turn chaperone always on, but I guess it helps to learn.An usual strategy is to match a real world wall/corner to a virtual one, then coming back to a similar position after some virtual locomotion to kill an archer or whatever.Such habits leads to better confidence when doing some plunging stabs: real space availability is known. So attacks can be unchained and enjoyment maximized.Also watch out for internal damage. Reckless reactions can be hard on the joints and tendons. Better warm-up your upper body by playing a session of Audioshield, Soundboxing or whatever you like."

I personally love getting two one-handed swords, and executing gladiators Anakin style; pulling off combo's in slow-mo feels amazing too, nothing like chopping someone's leg off and slicing their neck as the fall over.The updates seem nice and fleshed out. Although it's still on early access by the time of this review, it feels like it's polished enough to be considered a full game; I've only experienced a couple of game breaking bugs and crashes, nothing out of the ordinary.The game got me sweating several times, but if you're looking for a workout-fighting game, I highly recommend ""The Thrill of The Fight"".

Gorn is the best implementation of melee combat in VR to date, by a landslide.I can't say that I've ever actually cut someone's head off with a gladius in real life.  Nor have I let loose a tight circling flail at the perfect moment to crush a man's skull - but when you play this game, you'll feel you'd know just how to do it - it's that intuitive and real in the ""feel"" of it all.  It took the swarm of positive reviews to get me past my aversion to the cartoony graphics - but now I understand their purpose.  It's to keep me out of therapy...if it looked as real as it felt, I don't think I could feel good about myself after the things that I have done.I'm only typing this review now instead of playing, b/c after my 5 hours session yesterday, my arm is too sore to bash heads today.  This is an early access steal and is a must-own title imo.  Before full release, I'm hoping to see some better sound design (weapon sounds are decent, but ambient sounds seem a little messed up).  I'd also like to see more ""challenges"" similar to the weapon unlocks in the campaign (i.e. pull off these things this round to earn a master rank on the level or something...).

He fell onto his hammer in a way that he rode around the arena like a witch on a broomstick....with no legs....and a heart of steel. I ended up spearing him extracting his heart.  Next round i bashed a dude with a maul. His head split and his hammer went flying straight up in the air. I lost it, began fighting the others when about 15 seconds later the hammer came down from the heavens and bashed a dudes head in.Seriously this is the funniest game ever. I could tell stories all day.Ok one more story. I was fighting these 4 dudes, 3 with spears and 1 dual wielding nunchucks. I I cut a leg off of 2 of the spear guys.  I then hit the guy with the nunchucks and he fell to the ground. He got back up between his brothers spear and his brothers chest. So it was like the spear guy was holding him back. He was flailing his nunchucks like a madman while his bro was like ""NO DONT DO IT PEDRO! ITS NOT WORTH IT!"" Then finally Pedro knocked his brother out and came at me. I picked up a nunchuck myself and let loose my elite training back in Nam. I took Pedro to school. At this point his brother had awoken and was coming at me with a level of intensity ive never seen before.  I had no choice but to back the heck up. Pedro's brother was fierce with that spear. As i was backing up the guys who i chopped the legs off decided to go for one last moment of glory and they both speared me at the same time in a way anyone with no legs lying on the ground would do it.11/10 this is what VR is all about."

I am clearly in the minority in my rating so bear in mind, this is just my personal opinion. If you're interested, buy it, test it for 1.9 hours and make up your mind. But I found the following with this game -The positive:The movement in this game is original and causes no motion sickness at all. I mean really, it's slick.A nice mix of weapons and challenges, some of which revolve around picking up dead foes weapons. So you actually have to think.Damn good exercie. I was all sweaty andwornGORN out. It was a good workout.Some of the animations were funny the 1st few times.You can actually give the finger lol.The negative:I know this is EA so it's difficult to complain but, really, after just under 2 hours I realized all this is, is repeatedly trying to melee the exact same, cartoony looking, 1-3 wobbly guys with bendy legs and weapons over, and over, and over. For all of that positive, I just got... bored. Hopelessly bored.After just 2 hours I had almost every weapon, and was working my way though the challenges (more or less). It's a fun game, really fun, at first. Most of the reviews (though not all) have less than 5-7 hours played, that's about how long this game is fun for in my opinion.It can be very frustrating, watch Jacksepticeye and how annoyed he gets at not being able to effectively parry certain hits because the weapons actually wobble.All in all, it is a fun game at first. Just don't expect a lot of mileage out of it. I refunded mine."

Incredible mechanics and loads of ways to destroy your enemies.But be warned, you will probably give your HTC Vive water damage from how much you sweat. And your arms swinging about? Damn. I wish the chaperone boundaries were on 24/7.The game is hard, though. Very hard.  Be careful when finishing the bosses because the regular arena turns into endless mode. Which is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid if you haven't unlocked all the weapons, as you aren't credited for the kills with specific weapons until the end. Furthermore; the enemies take several hits to break through including the armour which some weapons can barely punch through.So who thought it was a good ♥♥♥♥ing idea to make you die in 2 hits I don't know, but you're an awful person. You can't even regenerate - You need to play so carefully and it goes from fun to incredibly frustrating.Also, RNG for the weapon spawns at the beginning? Come on. I had to kill myself 5 times before the damn bow spawned, and then having to go through 4 waves of enemies and LIVE or your progress is reset? Boy, the game gets not fun.What I'd like to see:- No RNG on weapon spawns at the beginning.- Increased HP before dying (Or even a toggleable godmode)- Better tracking of weapon unlocks.- Regular arena not turning into endless mode.- A new arena."

,Recommended,578620,33469025,Posted: 11 July,all,Dripping Yellow Madness,"This is a lot of fun and highly recommended.My biggest gripe is that it's too easy to just grab a mace and swish it back and forth at enemies with your wrist to kill them.  Attacks shouldn't do damage unless you take a swing or stab.  Gotta fix that, because right now the best strategy for winning isn't very satisfying."
,Recommended,578620,33438623,Posted: 10 July,all,The Beer Baron,"This game is great. It is so much fun and it goes to show you how much a really good mechanic can drive a game, and provide many hours of fun. However I do have one gripe with the game so far.The ""story"" mode is quite good right up until you defeat the last boss (at the time of this writing). After the last boss the main event starts to feel too long. The game starts you out in an arena with one naked dude to fight fisticuffs style. And as you get more kills with certain weapons you'll unlock more weapons to play with. That is great, and I love it. But after you fight the final boss (btw, we totally need the ability to re-play bosses, they are some of the most fun fights in the game) suddenly you're fighting crowds of 30+ fully armed and armored men. Just when you think you're done more enemies come out, and even though the mechanics are great, eventually you're going to take a hit no matter how good you are. And that leads to some frustration as weapon unlock requirements only count once you've finished an arena wave. Which means that the 10 minutes you spent killing through 30+ dudes only to have a door open behind your back and get sucker punched to death is all for waste.If I had to make a suggestion it would be to up the requirements to unlock weapons (ex. instead of 10 sword kills to unlock the bow make it 25), but make the kills count even if you fail a match. I believe that would take a lot of the frustraton out of the end-game. Plus weapon unlocks are a little too easy anyway, it feels like they are given away like candy. There is nothing wrong with having to work for rewards a little.But despite that one gripe, the game is incredible, and I can't wait to see where the devs take it!"

That's a rare enough thing on its own. 10/10 game devs. My concern when I bought it was that the hit detection would be all wonky like we've all experienced with antiquated hardware like the WII.

I figured it would be decent, as I was looking for a new VR distraction for the times I didn't feel like Elite or Bridge Crew - this fits the bill pretty well!Some of the extened arena battles will have you work up a sweat, and the beauty of the VR is when you are engaged with 2 gladiators to the front, and mentally trying to recall at a feverish pace how much time you have to deal with them before the Bezerker that just entered the arena behind you turns you into a fine red paste on the arena sand.  Turn now....still have time...turn now...???  Ok maybe 5 more seconds...turn now...CRAP he's right there!

Jump in for 5 mins, or just play is straight for a couple of hours - I just don't seem to get bored of this game. I have already unlocked all weapons, and reset the game - currently on my third run through. Its exhausting, but exhilarating. Beyond gory, but satisfying. The most satisfying fighting mechanics I have seem in a VR game to date.My only (minor) complaints about this game:The locomotion system did take a little time to get used to, It's really a limit of the technology though, not this game. Without magic transporting (which would not work in this game), moving more than 3 feet just isn't practical in VR today.You do need more space than the average game to play - you will want at least a ft of space around your play area to make sure you aren't banging into walls - but it's well worth the extra space.For the life of me I cannot figure out how you are supposed to correctly use most of the two handed weapons. The weight of the giant flail and the hammer is just wrong and makes them pretty pointless. That said, other weapons are perfect - give me the giant axe and the basic sword and I will fill your arena with bodies (and body parts) all day long.Gorn is so fun it has ruined other fighting games for me!"

It just feels good. There's a certain sense of bloodlust and wonder that comes with being thrown into an arena. As I sprint across the virtual land I lunge at a guy and shank him 32 times in the chest. I never knew I wanted to stab someone so badly until I came across this game. Not to mention that the devs have been great with updates.My reccomendation is that if you have the money, get the game. I've paid more for pizza that I've spent less time with and won't ever get to eat again. This game is literal hours of fun. Seeing heads pop like grapes when you hit them with a gigantic 2 handed hammer or landing throwing daggers in someones skull or picking up someone and ripping their arm off and showing the crowd are all things that are too good to experience.

If you've ever wanted to shout ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED to the crowds and give them the middle finger, this is also for you.GORN is the most mindless murderfest I've ever played.Built from the ground up for VR you can see how much attention the developers have put into this to make the physics feel like real combat physics. And the results speak for themselves. In this GORN you can't just wrist flick your fake VR sword quickly left and right to score hits like in other games, rather you have to swing each hit into position with force and precision.The weapons feel just right, you swing a flail around in circles like you would in real life to get the momentum going then clobber some dude in the head and watch it explode. Eyeballs pop out, heads get sliced in half, this is brutal combat but in a ridiculously cartoony fashion. The spear actually feels like it has a long reach and you have strategically aim for his exposed chest or head depend which body part you feel like ripping off. If you got the sword and a shielded gladiator dude comes up, you can literally duck his attack and slice his legs in half.  Sword and shields combat has never felt so real.This game is a must for VR,  but make sure you have lots of space in your room because i've had quite a few close hits with my TV etc. Also, this game is one hell of a sweaty workout I'd hate to think how knackered real gladiators got.Definite positive, there's no other sword combat simulator that offers such an immersive physical experience."

,Recommended,578620,33472478,Posted: 11 July,all,Auburok,"So I've done melee combat in VR before, but Gorn gets a lot of things right. It's not perfect, but it has potential to be a real contender for the standard in VR melee.Gorn, as of the moment (Early Access), is an arena fighter where you're some Roman gladiator or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Locomotion is kind of strange - you swing your arms while alternating touch pad presses, as if you were climbing a ladder on the ground (H3VR does something similar for the challenge course things it has). Either hand is open and closes with a trigger pull, or you can invert it with the menu button and open on click instead, which is useful for using weapons.Hand to hand combat is the focus, and it's pretty good. The game utilizes physics to judge the strength of your attacks, so there's a different between jabs and swings, pokes and slams. I think it's better to list what you can do than just outline it.You can:PunchRip off heads and armsSwing or toss said partsPick up and use bodies as shields, or throw themSwing swords and axes (chopping off parts or cutting heads in half)Smash armor and shields with hammers, morning stars and maces (armor flies off as if Guts™ smashed a dude)Use two handed weapons like war hammers, giant morning stars and spears (and puck out hearts with a poke)Attach throwing knives to one arm for quick distance attacksUse a bow and arrowParry strikes with a weapon to slow time downNunchaku broUse a shield and bash someone's face in with itFlip off the emperorMost weapons are things you have to unlock doing challenges, like killing with certain weapons or a particular way. Enemies are all the same aside from different armored bits and different weapons. Weapons determine how the enemies attack you, but they are all sort of dumb grunts that move in to strike you, which is fine for this game (though they will probably need harder enemies or a harder mode down the line). Enemies come in random waves ranging from 1 to 5 enemies at a time.Some tips:Clear your spaceDon't let people new to VR playUse your wrist straps"

Over the year the developer has taken it from a third party download alpha state, to an early access steam release. You will sweat, smash your controller, face, and possessions; but you will smile while doing so. This game should probably be priced at half its current value given the barbones content. It has one map, one enemy type, and a movement system that is by far the worst in VR. The movement set up makes you move as sluggish as the enemys but results in excessive energy being burnt on your end making you sweat uncontrollably. The developer needs to add double the weapons, at least 3 more maps, more enemy types (not just different armors), and please a better ability to block. Overall it is a great deal of fun, but as is common with VR experiences, expensive for the current amount of content."

I played it when it was in its second stage of development, and I loved it. It had the perfect sense of gore and humor that I loved, I still love it now . However, there's a slight problem.I'm a few hours in, I've beaten all 4 champions and almost have all weapons. The lack of content isn't the problem, I expected minimal content, it was just released a few weeks ago. My problem is the Arena mode.At the start, the Arena mode was a lot of fun, there weren't a lot of enemies to make it feel drawn out, but not too few to make it feel to easy.Then, I reached the end, the Arena mode essentially became Endless Mode, after besting about 5 waves of enemies, more just kept coming. At this point I just got frustrated, I said to myself ""What's the point of making this so long, there's Endless mode for this."" The game just got really boring.I'm not saying Endless mode is a bad thing, I'm just saying is when I feel like playing a non-Endless GORN, I can play it. Also, because it never ends, I can't unlock new weapons because when I never get the weapons to do the tasks and when I do, I can never complete the task because of the overwhelming amount of bad guys or simply because I die before it ends.Free Lives, I like your game a lot, but just reduce the amount of waves during Arena mode because tbh Arena mode feels like Endless even though it's not.

The locomotion is sticky and the nature of the combat makes outcomes extremely random. It wouldn't be a problem, but later in the game gets extremely unforgiving. Two hits and you're done. So when one of those baddie's arms gets stuck on someting and then springs at you from an awkward glitchy angle, say goodbye to your fight.You can cheese it with the giant two handed weapons that wreck everything, but then the games goes from unforgiving to a cakewalk and that gets old pretty quickly.This may all get worked out after early access, in which case I'll come right back and have a blast.

I am using the new vive headset with the built in headphones. So, if it does not work on those, then the sound is designed wrong.I will update my review once the problems are fixed, or after the next update.

I've played it since its early alpha days (it was available for free on their website), and it has come a long way even from the last free build.  The biggest improvements for me are that you can now walk around the arena (the free version had no VR movement system) and we now get to choose our weapons from a selection of five of our unlocked weapons, rather than being given two random weapons.  Overall, it's good, gruesome fun, with a pretty reasonable balance between weapon types.Having said all that - if you come from a fighting background and expect a super realistic fighting simulator, this might be the best VR has to offer, but it's still not what you're looking for.  In particular, blocking is done pretty poorly - it seems you have to block the damage-dealing part of your enemy's weapon with the damage-dealing part of your weapon, so those of us who have been trained to stop the arm swinging that weapon instead might need to adjust their tactics."

If you want a game to show off VR it's this, Google earth vr, tilt brush and superhot.There's also numerous unlocks which allows for strategy. start with a bow to pick off the first guys, use the armor breaker to destroy armor then use the sword to cut off their head. You can also pick up dead enemies to throw at other enemies.

You can rip a man's heart out in this version and throw it on the ground.  How can you argue with that?Gorn is by far the most fun game to play on the Vive (and I assume any other VR platform), and you WILL sweat like you've run a marathon after playing."

,Recommended,578620,33488085,Posted: 12 July,all,cnielsen05,"I've played most of the melee combat VR games available and GORN stands well above the others for one reason: physics-based combat. Instead of memorizing attack animations and learning when to swing where as you will in numerous other games, GORN will have you actually parry, move, and strike in a very natural way.The realistic nature of a physics-based combat system contrasts starkly with the humorous style the game presents through the condescending caricatures of onlookers above the arena, the wobbly movements of your enemies, the rubbery flexible nature of the shafts of all the weapons, and the wonderful showers of blood and gore the game offers. The result is a masterpiece that takes the right things seriously, and makes light of all the rest.I strongly recommend this game to anyone who has sufficient space to play it. There are some caveats though -- first off, it is worth reiterating you NEED proper space to play this game. If you have a crowded VR space with lots of fragile objects, children/pets who may enter your gaming area while you are playing, or an aversion to sweating profusely, this game may not be ideal for you. Be aware that no matter how effectively you've managed to avoid hitting things while playing other games, GORN has a strong potential to change that. The trailer is not a joke.Two interesting design choices that stood out to me in this game that I think are worth addressing beyond the physics-based combat are movement and the flexible weapon shafts.MovementGORN uses an arm-swinging movement mechanic that will leave you feeling far less fast and mobile than most other melee combat VR games. You will rely on your roomscale space more than you do in other games as a result of this, so make sure you have plenty of space. This also makes it feel like you really need to fight to survive, running is not a very viable strategy.Flexible weapon shaftsA problem that plagues all VR melee combat games is the cheesy ""wiggling"" tactics to kill enemies. If you've played a lot of the other offerings out there, you have almost certainly encountered this. GORN solves this problem completely with the rubbery weapon shafts as damage seems to be based on the momentum of the weapon when it hits the enemy. If you wiggle the weapon around without committing to a proper swing, it is not going to kill anything."

From swords to a giant hammer for destroying armor, you can be guaranteed to find a good weapon to fit you.3. Super satisfying to kill and cut off limbs of your enemies.4. Dev is a great person and is always listening for ways to enhance the game, and knows what's good and what's not good for the game.5.  3 different game modes to pick from, and all are very fun.Cons:1. Some small bugs like enemies glitching around the map and somehow hitting you.  (While very funny, it is still a bug)2. Movement system doesn't fit all people.  Many people are used to teleportation, which this game does not have.  I'm perfectly fine with the movement systems currently in place, but some people get extremely motion sick.

I quickly realized that it was a tier above the rest, when it comes to a physics based world where things arent off limits, and you can do whatever you can immagine. Throw a robot in the air, teleport over to where he'll land, and take his head off with a shotgun? Totally. Rip a head off, and use it to complete the whole level. Totally. Phyisics are a big part of making all of that feel right, and Gorn recaptures that feeling for me. In regards to bringing be back again and again, it supercedes Roborecall, and there is still more content to come. There are only two things I can think of, that I hope get adressed. There are physics bugs (that end up just being funny), but there are also camera bugs. Seeing the world spining out from beneath you can be disorienting, but that's something I have to immagine will be adressed. The second thing is pretty oculus exclusive. I have ok 360 tracking, but I have very little room behind me. This leads to me circling the arena trying to keep everything in front of me. If they added the ability to turn the camera 180 degrees, it would make it a lot friendlier to Oculus users or anyone with room constaraints. I'm not a developer, and for all I know that would some how break the game, but it would be nice. Either way, it would be a mistake to pass this game up no matter what you're playing it on."

,Recommended,578620,33610038,Posted: 17 July,all,PL,"Playing on Oculus Touch, i5-7600K CPU with GTX 1070 GPU.GORN isn't perfect, but it is the best representation of melee combat I've seen in VR so far.  Concept is pretty simple, they put you in an arena with CPU controlled fighters, give you a random selection of weapons to choose from, you salute the emperor (raise your hands) and then fight.  If you enjoyed Drunkn Bar Fight, this game does it MUCH better.Default locomotion is done by clicking in the thumbsticks and ""pulling"" yourself across the ground.  There have been a lot of complaints about this movement style, so they have recently added free thumbstick locomotion.  I honestly prefer the default, classic GORN style of movement because it allows much faster and more agile movement, but to each his own.Fighting is simple and intuitive.  Blunt objects stun enemies when hitting them on the head, and break armor quickly.  Slashing weapons (sword, axe) will sever unarmored limbs.  Stabby weapons (spear, dagger) will stun or insta-kill when stabbing someone in the chest or face.  Giant weapons require two hands but can knock people around the ring, easily break armor, and can stun regardless of armor.  But you already know this because that's what all these weapons would probably do in real life as well.Starting out, your choice of weapons is slim.  Unlocking new weapons is done through fulfilling objectives.  For example, killing 5 people with the mace unlocks a weapon, killing 5 people with that weapon unlocks another weapon, etc.  Some weapons are only unlocked by picking them off of a dead body and killing five people with that weapon (e.g. Sword is unlocked this way).  Eventually you will have a variety of weapons to choose from at the beginning of every fight, although that variety is random every time.  Sometimes you may not get your favorite weapon and have to make do with the choices you have.  This isn't particularly a bad thing, since sometimes you find out new ways to utilize a weapon you originally hated.  I hated the nunchucks at first, but after being forced to use them a few times, I found out they're exceptionally good for stunning enemies.After playing the normal game mode for a while, you unlock ""champion battle"", which is basically boss fights.  Currently there are only a few boss fights available, but once you finish them all, there is a sign on the door saying ""More coming soon"" (or something along those lines) so hopefully they add more of those because they were interesting.  One of the bosses even has a special move where he jumps at you through the air, wielding a two-handed warhammer.  I am really looking forward to more little AI routines like this one to spice up combat.I will admit that at first, I felt cautious about paying $15 for GORN.  At a glance it seems like there isn't much there, and that's not really an inaccurate observation.  What IS there is what matters though, the game is extremely fun to play even in its current state and that should be what matters most.  If you're looking for anything resembling a story or deep character progression, you may want to wait before buying this.  If you're looking for a fun VR game that currently represents the feeling of melee combat better than any game I have ever played, then I'd recommend picking this up."

I've only scratched the surface of this game and am still finding myself with an ample amount of content to play through.This game was created by the company Free Lives the creators of the wonderful game BroForce (a personal favorite of mine) and has been published by Devolver Digital (another finominal company). So when they have launched this already polished game (in Vr Standards *cough cough*) into Early Access, it gives me high hopes for the final product of the game.Some things I do hope they add are as follows- Arenas with obstacles- Possibly a leveling system- A way to purchase upgrades with gold awarded at the end of arena battles- CO-OP (please please please add this my lawrd)- Of course new enemies and weapons (they already mentioned adding this)Seriously though if you haven't purchased this game and own a Vive you are insane."

,Recommended,578620,34011985,Posted: 4 August,all,Twitch,Best melee vr game.
76561198043109923,Recommended,578620,34005631,Posted: 3 August,all,Game of Chance,"TL;DR: Buy this game right now. You won't find better melee anywhere else in VR.I've got to say, this game is already well-worth the money, and the dev isn't showing any signs of slowing down in content. This is gonna be a long one so buckle in, boys and girls.Pros:- Unbelievably good melee combat that is leagues beyond the competition. There's such a variety of weapons and they all shine in their own ways (some more than others, admittedly) You didn't know how impactful VR could feel until you've beaten a guy to death with a rock or swung a flail as it dynamically crushes your opponants armour.- Plenty of content. The game has more of a ""sandbox"" feel to it than a campaign or anything. However, there is definitely already progression. You can unlock new weapons by defeating enemies in the arena (removing 5 hearts with a spear, for example) and you will also find your arena runs get progressively more challenging, unlocking bosses in a special ""challenge"" mode which is insanely fun.- Just as fun to watch as it is to play. This game isn't for the faint of heart though. Be very selective who you give a go of this game, because you really want your ""VR legs"" and good spacial awareness, otherwise you'll smash everything around you, including yourself. The trailer speaks for itself and it's no joke.- Incredibly immersive. At first you think ""wow, these gladiators look kinda dumb"" and similarly ""what the hell are those big-headed dudes in the crowd?"" but once you land your first punch, you'll be right at home. Enemies are dynamically injured, and their arnour is dynamically broken as well. You can remove limbs, tear off heads, impale hearts and shatter bones. Your enemies will still (try to) fight with those grusome wounds too.- ""Honest"" combat. Enemy attacks are somewhat predetermined, meaning they will usually swing their weapon in a variety of general directions. The beauty is how many variables affect their swings to make them all behave very differently. Your first time going up against a guy with a flail is terrifying, until he manages to knock himself out with the flail swinging above his head, which happens rarely enough to be hilarious every time.- Slow-mo. Let's face it, slow-mo combat always feels cool. So when you expertly parry their swing or land a headshot with an arrow, the triggered slow-mo not only feels great, but you can set up your next attack for some lethal combos.- Weapon variety. I mentioned this earlier, but weapons aren't just aesthetically different. Some weapons, such as swords or axes, can decapitate foes with lethal efficiency, but struggle to penetrate plate. However, hammers and flails can crush that plate or leave foes stunned, leaving those fleshy bits exposed for the kill. Spears can accurately penetrate gaps in armour and bleed your enemies out slowly. Bows and throwing knives can disable your enemies and pick them off from a distance. Shields are invaluable for dealing wtih bowmen or protecting your flank. Rocks smash faces. There's still many more weapons beyond that, too.- Multiple modes. Currently there is arena (typically for unlocking weapons, usually lasts a few waves), challenge (1v1 duels with some very intimidating bosses) and also endless mode (massacre as many people as possible and beat your high score) There are also many more modes currently being tested in experimental mode (which anyone can optionally access once they buy the game) but I'll just mention what's in the ""official"" version.- Variety of movement types. There are currently technically 3 types of movement (2 really) in the game, walking with the touchpads (HMD or controller facing) and GORN. The latter is definitely the way the game is supposed to be played, and looks fantastic when people get the hang of it, but I personally use the latter HMD walking. I find the GORN movement to be very difficult to use but have no serious problems with my own familiar movement method, though your combat potential is definitely higher using GORN movement since you can dash in before they can react.- Fantastic dev. This is probably the biggest positive to me. This dev is unbelievably responsive to the community. I have even spoke with Ruan a few times already regarding a few suggestions I had, and he took my feedback on board and had the one he liked on the ""experimental"" version within a couple of days! Somebody else, around the same time, said it would be cool to have an ""invincible"" mode where you can beat people up freely. ""Sure, added"" said the dev. Also on the experimental version already as I type this. In a world where the EA market is flooded with garbage and cash-grabs, this dev is like an oasis in the desert.Cons:- The game really needs space. I hinted to this earlier, but you will need roomscale for this game. You will sweat and you will ache. The game recommends 2x2 metres to play. I currently play around 2.2x1.6, so not ideal. That being said, if you regularly check you are central to your playspace, you should be fine with around 1.5x1.5 (but bigger is always better). If you have less than that, you'd better be damn good at staying in the centre or you (and anyone near you) are gonna have a bad time.- Because of the last point and the sheer chaos the game can have going on sometimes, this game isn't something you'd give to someone who hasn't played VR before. If you want to risk it, make them wear the wristwraps and make sure they can hear you over the game volume (leave an earplug out or something) so you can guide them away from smashing your room apart when necessary.- The game still needs optimisation, as with most early access games. I run the game with a pretty good GPU (RX 480) and the game does run at a very good framerate usually. However, there are times when the framerate can chug quite hard, particularly when there's a lot of ragdoll physics going on (hitting a bunch of dudes with a greathammer, shattering multiple pieces of armour and sending blood and people flying everywhere) although these have been few and far between for me. Certainly hasn't impeded my enjoyment of the game too much, but worth mentioning still.- This game can be frustratingly hard or too easy sometimeas. Early on most people will probably find the game very easy, especially with cheese tactics, but difficulty can rise deceptively quickly once multiple enemies start showing up, especially when they wear armour. Sometimes you can feel like you just don't have the right weapons around to fight, as fighting an fully-armoured foes without a blunt weapon or an archer without a shield to block his arrows can feel like suicide. As you can only withstand two hits before you die (from any weapon, even fists) you really do have to be careful with the risks you take in combat.- Some weapons currently don't feel as fun as they should. This is mainly personal preference here. The rapier feels like it needs more range to get effective stabs without the player being too exposed to counterattacks. the nun-chucks are awesome (because they're damn nun-chucks) but there's no real reason to use them over other weapons, as they aren't particularly effective at damaging armour or breaking bones, yet suffer from a very low range (though they attack very fast to possibly make up for that.) Throwing knives are bloody hard to use, they're extremely cool and satisfying when you land one but definitely take lots of practise if you want those glorious headshot kills.- Glitchy (no way?!) Sometimes weapons feel kinda like they're inflatable (as they sometimes bend in weird ways to avoid clipping) but they feel too impactful and deadly to always feel like that. I personally find this compromise to be much better than magically clipping through everything constantly or the weapon ""seperating"" from you. Sometimes physics can ""break"" but usually the results are hilarious, not obnoxious.Buy this game."

I've only had it a few hours so I can't say how long it'll hold up, considering it's only single player for now. I really hope they have plans for multi because it could be a standout game. If they don't do it someone else will. This genre of game could easily be a competitve draw for VR once all the kinks are worked out.

Two days later after hour long sessions, I will be giving up my gym time for this. This game should be mandatory for high schoolers who don't want to take gym class.As a legit review though, this game is intense, strenuous, and kind of shallow.  There isn't a story (or not one that I have found yet) and while this game is the definition of repetitive it is always exciting and will always get your heart pumping.   Simply for the bloodlust and adrenaline you are guaranteed to get this deserves a 10/10, however I do have a few gripes.  I do not see anywhere on the page or requirements but you HAVE to have a 360 setup and you HAVE to have room (no standing in one spot) or you cannot play this game. I also kind of have an issue with how you turn, because you have to turn in real life you have to constantly be conscience of your cord which really does not let you full emerse yourself.  I feel like the developers should allow for turning via joystick to at least be an option until wireless VRs/VR attachments come out.So if you have a 360 set up, don't mind sweating and potentially breaking something you need to buy this game."

,Recommended,578620,34387641,Posted: 20 August,all,Gergg,"GORN is one of the most enjoyable and exhausting games I've played on the Vive.WeaponsYou get a nice array of weapons to play with from swords/axes/hammers to a brace of throwing daggers or a giant flail. My personal favorites are the spear for its lunge capability and the rapier/shield for stabbing at the enemy from cover. The variety in weapons actually feels like variety because they all play to various strengths and weaknesses.MovementMovement was a bit of a chore at first using the default style of movement (clicking track pads and swinging arms) but once I switched to the scheme where you can just click-and-hold the pads in a direction to move things got a lot easier. If you have a setup like mine where the cord drops behind you to the floor you may have the same trouble I did with taking advantage of the 360 degree aspect of the game. I've been mainly working with about 300 degrees of rotation and I feel somewhat vulnerable as a result.CombatThe combat is gorey in a goofy way with limbs popping off, eyes hanging out of sockets, and being able to gore enemy hearts right out of their chest. You can even abandon conventional weapons and pull their head off orm bash it in with a rock.ModesA standard campaign that gets harder with each fight won eventually unlocking the ability to fight unique champion enemies. Eventually you unlock an Endless mode. That's it, but it's more than enough and keeps the menus simple and the time outside of combat minimal.What really makes this game worth the money to me is the workout it can provide. After so many fights you won't be able to raise your arms above your head (the move to signify you're ready for the battle to begin) and the sweat will be pooling in your eyes."

If you want to see how to make melee combat feel satisfying in VR then look no further. The weapons feel weighty even though you're just waving your hands around, because they all have a momentum and a rubbery wiggle to them in game. Flicking your wrist like you're holding an old wii-mote won't get you anywhere, you need to put some muscle behind your swings.

Another suggestion would be maybe adding x-rays in arena mode on the final enemy's killing blow or at the end of every wave of enemies, smarter ai and last but not least, more weapons.This game has alot of content vr-wise for being early access and i hope many other major updates to come."

Haven't tried it yet, but I think I need to revise my review."

It is just a fun, stress releaving time. The bosses are somewhat challenging and fun. There isn't really much else to say the game got such a good score for a reason.My only complaint is that after beating the game and obtaining every weapon the enemies get to be to strong and you can almost never win without cheesing the game, I wish there was like a difficulty setting or slider. :)"

This is hands down the best VR game I have played yet.Some suggestions for the developer:> Maybe have a way to punch through chests and pull out hearts like F**king Mortal Combat or something> The spear and trench knife/dagger whatever you have it labeled as have often not stabbed opponents for me even though the force was plenty sufficent.> The spear's slashing power seems to have waned exponentially since the last update, is that intentional? If so, I recommend that it either be brought back or another polearm type weapon be brought in such as a halberd.> On the subject of weapons, here are some that I believe would make a great addition to the game: Katana (slashing and piercing damage being available), War Axe or some sort of 2 handed axe, Staff, Power fist (like fallout 4 i know it doesnt fit as far as gladiator style combat, but it would be fun), Claw gauntlet, A lasso ( hear me out, this game loves to dismember opponents right? So think of lassoing someone around their head or body and just swinging them around the arena like a flail), and last for what I cant think of right now, a pickaxe; it could be a 1 or 2 handed weapon that could pierce armor and deal thrusting damage> And last on the list, I think that Arena traps would be interesting for sure. Maybe like a spike pit that opens up every now and then or just stays open idk"

I keep coming back to it to beat more heads in.But the reason I'm writing this review: Make sure you have a decent play area. Seriously. And move valuable stuff like tv's and monitors well away. Fists will be swinging and I'm a very lucky person that I don't have an oculus controller lodged in my wall. (Although, I do have a very scraped controller now, and also a broken lightshade)"
