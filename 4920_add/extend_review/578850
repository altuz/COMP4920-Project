As huge DDR and Pump-it-up fan (on the floor and on keyboard), I had my good share of rhythm / hardcore games. I posted on the forums seeing if the developers can comment....but in the meantime I wanted to warn you with this videohttps://youtu.be/8YxFrbJnT9ASomehow the rhythm and the 'bad guys' don't move at the same speed after some time. As you can see those 'bad guys' gradually go faster, while the music doesn't. They were not positioned in a way related to beat or upbeat or triplets or similar, it just feels wrong and in that moment you just had to press the keys completely unrelated to what the music is playing.Of course I could play past that point and the video is just to explain what I mean, but what is the point, if you must ignore the music in the background?"

I like to do it only with indie games and that these have something in which I have seen a different spark and not a game more of the mound. 64.0 shows you that less is never more. Clearly 64.0 is not a mobile game ported to the pc, it really could work in tactil, but it clearly feels like a pc game. Good jobP.S.

A wonderfully simple concept with fantastic execution with an amazing soundtrack that is just icing on this indie gem cake. Oh, and it's cheaper than chips.The Bad (EDITED):The latest update to the game address my original minor complaint about a lack of options menu by adding an exit button, a switch between fullscreen and windowed as well as volume controls. Props to the dev for listening to the community!It's difficult but fair, maybe too difficult for some so your milage might vary. I'd say pick it up anyway, it costs less than a coffee and is well worth the asking price. Now if you excuse me I'm going to go back to trying to finally beat one of the levels."

Get that in your head, this isn't quite osu! or rhythmn heaven. So if you're on the slower side reflexwise, you're gonna be challenged quite a bit.The devs seem to have responded to player feedback on level design as well as recently added some support for custom levels - I can only expect more expansion from here, and honestly, one of the levels they tweaked was overly punishing in the past, so it's more fun for me now.Only con is that if you're unfamiliar with navigating the game, the UI can be a bit disorienting due to its minimalist nature.Overall, I'm pleased with paying $4.99 for it, give it a go!"

I must say this game is alot of fun to play, maybe its because im a sucker for good rhythm games but either way I'm full impressed with the outcome. Now there were a few minor nitpicks I had about it:1: sync,I've only played a little bit of the levels that you get at the start and I noticed that the levels sync very nicely with the songs but I found that sometimes it didnt really sync that well, It's nothing I cant deal with though.2: (my bigger nitpick) ResolutionThis one I found as a big letdown for it, in the trailer you showed it as a Square-shaped playspace with little tunnals on all 4 walls, when I opened it up for the first time and every time after, it was locked in full screen and was stretched horizontally... I would like to make a suggestion that you make and options menu for toggleing windowed and full screen and also when it is in windowed being able to change the size of the window aswell..Finally 3: (the important nitpick) Exit?I looked everywhere for the 'exit game' button and couldn't find it, wasn't in the main room, neither did the ESC key work, so that would be greatly helpfull if you could add those or if they are already there to make them more clear as to where they are!Over all I'm very happy with this game, just add those buttons in and it'll be perfect, as far as the price, I got it for the 15% disscount but I think that 2.99 is a well rounded price for a simplistic game such as this. If you want a fun little music game; by all means pick this up, but dont underestimate the trailer. Like the description says... You will fail alot, and I speak from experience XD Keep up the good work and get those options added!Final rateing 8/10 (no visible way to exit and the resolution)"

Recommend it if you have amazing hand-eye coordination unlike me. However, the beat seems subtly off, and if you're shooting to the beat, it really feels like the targets are moving ever so slightly faster than it.~~~Suggestion to the Devs to add some difficulty modifiers to allow us casuals to play (stuff like being able to lock the background to a consistent set of colors instead of the pallet changing each try, or being able to remove good guys).Also, D-Pad controller support would be amazing, but I can always use Joy2Key."

You'll be trying the same level, over and over and over, only to find out you're losing progress.. Not projecting at all..I feel like the best way to describe this game is Super Hexagon, but instead of just reaction times, it's also testing your memory. Each level seems to have it's own focus. Some on focusing on what to not shoot, some on memory, and some on shooting diagonal. Each of the levels has a sort of randomized nature to it, as in, it will still use the same beat each time, but the direction you'll have to shoot will change.The music is amazing, and the gameplay is intense almost all of the time. My only issue with the game, is that on some of the stages (Most notably 64.3A), the beats of the music seem off of when the targets are meant to be shot. Maybe it's intentional, to add difficulty, but it's still annoying that a beat game feels off beat.Oh, and when a preview of a song starts, you can hear part of the 64.1A preview. Minor, but it's still annoying."

,Not Recommended,578850,35194332,Posted: 24 September,all,Lord Kaio,"I want to like this game.  The music is good, the concept is simple and it seems fun, but the controls aren't responsive enough.  Keyboard is fine for levels that are up/down/left/right, but diagonals feel wonky and unnatural.  On a controller, using the stick for directional input feels the best to me, but too many times did I die from something not responding in time versus actually screwing up.  I've tried with an Xbox One controller and a Steam Controller and both feel the same :-/I'll probably give this game another shot every once in a while, but I feel like it's not worth a standalone buy."

,Recommended,578850,30729945,Posted: 25 March,all,BS004,"A difficult, skill-based ""rhythm"" game where you press a directional button to shoot squares that has the same color as the background.Well, others say that the audio and the squares are not well synced, but I did not mind anyway, coz even if the sound and the appearance of the squares did match, there is still the need to look at where the squares are coming from because even though they had a pattern, the pattern begins randomly among the four sides of the screen and sometimes even the pattern changes. I'm not really accurate about this since I did not bother to study the patterns.Anyway, the concept is good. When I first saw it in a trailer in Facebook, I immediately loved the idea that this is gonna be one of those insane rage-inducing fast-paced games... And I love those kinds of games.The song choice is good. The song in 64.3 (Level 3) is the most catchy for me."

Now that we got that out of the way.64.0 is a fantastic game for people with an average of -3 second reaction times. It is a game based around coordination, skill, and sheer willpower as the levels are basically the same patterns, but from different directions, sometimes. Practice makes perfect with this game, and it is a true test of patience.If you have anger issues, I do not recommend this game.If you have epilepsy, I do not recommend level 4.Basically, enemies (who are transparent), come from a direction, and you shoot them with your guy (gray/white cube in the center). Allies (who are colored), also, come from a direction, and you don't shoot them. Luckily, there are only 4 directions. Unluckily, they come from all 4 directions.Firing and hitting nothing resets your streak.Firing and hitting an ally ends the game.NOT firing and hitting an ENEMY ends the game.Each level is approximately 64 seconds, and if you fail to be a master, you restart at 0 seconds and try again.Each level has its own new mechanic (although they aren't added until level 5 has all of them; they each have their own.)Failing to adapt to these new mechanics will make you want to give up.Seeing these new mechanics will make you want to give up.If you are a true legend, you will love this game. If you aren't, you will be down a monitor from baby rage.Currently live-streaming it attwitch.tv/alfa_overlord; thanks for reading this review.P.S.

I have to say I am just over an hour in and I am already extremely disappointed (This is obviously not considering this only costs 3€).The game has a great Soundtrack, except for the first Level...Speaking of wich: The first level,the level that is supposed to Hype you for the entire rest of the game, is really badly designed...Its just a complete mess not even properly teaching you the games mechanics and just suddenly throws a ridicoulus difficulty Spike at 15sec at you, wich I just cannot overlock with it being the first Level, its just frustating because the game gave you really no time to practice or build up to this moment. It may be there as a point to just brute force your way threw and get gud  wich I ,if it is the case, cannot understand whatsoever. This is just made worse by the fact that the music is horrible compared to the other levels.After giving up on the first level after reaching 35sec (another Spike) I went to play the second level wich in my opinion has not only a better soundtrack but also proper difficulty scaling and no insane difficulty Spikes (compared to its normal difficulty) and also a cool gimmik, but obviously after I noticed that I am still not good enough I went and looked at the other levels and suddenly notice that the third level is the one with the most clears??This just further proves the game design part of this game is just messed up when it comes to actual difficulty, I mean I really had high hopes... well maybe the bar was a bit high.Still... Its incredible how fast this game just straight up lost me after that first level... its a shame really because I like the idea and concept, but I would not know how to recommend something like this.Get Super Hexagon instead... a proper difficult game."

Honestly, I haven't stopped thinking about it all day.This tether of a soundtrack also has manic yet ordered gameplay as a tag team partner.

The music is awesome enough that it pushes me to get better and better, just to continue listening to the song (and they put the soundtrack as a free DLC!!!). At the full price of $3.00, this game is worth it, and since its on sale right now, there's no reason for you not to get it!"

,Recommended,578850,33382818,Posted: 8 July,all,Fantail,"Everyone who's a fan of rhythm-based games that look like button mashing (like all guitar-hero-type games) will love this.Pros:- Great soundtrack (that you can download for free!)- Runs on any toaster- Price is a steal- Low effort for high show-off potential (beat lvl 1 and 2 in ~2h but friends will think you're insane)Cons:- The first half hour you feel like sh*t, it's a little hard to get into (as even the first level isn't easy)Highly recommend a mechanical keyboard or at least a keyboard with n-key rollover that survives aggressive button abuse ^^"""

The screen shakes satisfyingly when you shoot, which gives everything a satisfying feel of weight.  When you die--and you will die--no time is wasted allowing you to try again, maintaining a good feel of flow.  Even the minimalist graphics work in the game's favour.  You have very little time to choose what to shoot and what to leave, and the simple style helps there.Obviously, you shouldn't get this if you're not willing to play something that demands good reflexes, pattern memorisation and a willingness to die over and over.  Other than that, there is little to criticise here.  There are only five levels plus endless mode, but each level will take at least an hour to beat.  Also, the level editor and community levels offset this.  The one thing that did annoy me is that every time you start the game, there's a screen telling you ""the music is awesome!""  You've already got my money, 64.0, and I'm quite capable of deciding the quality of the soundtrack myself.Given the price you can't expect too much from this game.  Honestly, though, I've had less enjoyment from plenty of more expensive games, so I'd definitely encourage you to check this out."

I just love all the soundtracks of this game and I totally reccomend it. 10/10.The price is perfect for this game, you and might as well just buy it now!"
