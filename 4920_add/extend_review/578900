76561198019964935,Recommended,578900,32033226,Posted: 28 May,all,Yglika,"I enjoyed this. It has lot of things I love. Namely:- A female protagonist- Tons of choices all the time (that's what 'interactivity' is about right?)- Moral choices can shape the main protagonist (good/evil/defiant/tactful)- It is possible to 'pretend' without fearing the game will assign you an incorrect personality since you 'fool it' as well. The story makes it quite clear when there is no point to 'pretend' and what you do now is indeed what you are/think and not something you just want others to believe about you.- Beautiful graphics- Interesting story- Protagonist has/gets special 'power'(s)****There _are_ some cons though:- If you play it for the second time you'll find out the impact of your choices is rather small. Of course that is/must be valid for almost any VN but still the branching could be better. However, at least the now released 2nd chapter seems to promise it _will_ improve (I don't want to go to spoilers here).- So far it is still rather short. But alright, it is still kind-of early access right? If all five chapters will be finished and have more or less the same size the total length of the story will be more than appropriate.---Overaly: Definitely worth it if you like moral-based fantasy VN with lot of choices. I just hope it will be indeed finished (on time)."
,Recommended,578900,32644111,Posted: 22 June,all,G_shen,"I'd recommend this game to anybody who's a little tired of the usual visual novel/ otome game protagonist. The MC has the potential to be so refreshingly witty, wicked, and rebellious. She isn't someone who's put through the shredder only to come out the other end without even a '♥♥♥♥ this', like the manaically docile protagonists you find everywhere. I live for revenge.Player choice is something that's often advertised but rarely followed through satisfyingly, and although I have yet to see how important all my choices are, it's extremely fun having some agency, even if it is just choosing a great come-back. Not to mention the dialogue can be very well thought out and the characterisation so far stays true to itself without resorting to archetypes - it makes it feel like the characters are well thought out and have a lot more going on below the surface. I'm also surprised that I had the best timeexchanging jabs with Sir Brash; instead of feeling irritated or outraged on behalf of a little angelic MC, I realised their dynamic was actually really funny and they were on more equal footing than I thought- I can't wait to see what kind of person he really is and watch as their relationship evolves.The episodes so far have beenvery intriguing, and I even like the mini games - they made me feel smart! The story has a lot more momentum, relative to other visual novels/ dating games, and it was really atmospheric at times as you move throughdungeons and camps sites and woodsetc. I think a lot of that can also be attributed to well placed background music and sounds. It really feels like an adventure.I only wish there was more content at the moment, as so far it's a little like reading the first two chapters of a good book and then putting it down - I must binge! I also hope there is enough opportunity further on down the line to really delve into the story as much as it deserves to be delved into - will just a few chapters be enough?"

And although VN really isn't my first choice in gaming, it delivers what it promised and I was thoroughly entertained and tickled for continuation. Although the core material was familiar to me, the story was fresh as if playing without previous knowledge. The response choices were good and in decent amount, small observations of the area a nice bonus. Characters and background are not static and are very well done. It is a bit short ( 77 min. for first playthrough ), but when all the chapters are out it will be a very complete game very much worth the price. Sincere thanks to the team who made this game possible, and I am eagerly waiting for more."

I fell in love.Depite me saying that the art style and the voice acting was what was pushing me away from the game, I found both of them enjoyable. It, in fact, added to the visual novel itself. The music was fantastic, the characters kept my interest, and it really didn't have a boring moment (or at least through chapter one)My only complaint is the price. Might not be a big deal to others, but $20 for five chapters doesn't sound too bad, but if each chapter is an hour and ten minutes like chapter one was... I feel the full price wouldn't be worth it, yet I didn't follow this game on greenlight or such. I hear it has replayablity factors, but we shall see. Eitherway, I would recommend it on sale, and if you have the money to spare, get it full price. So far, it is a 10/10"
,Recommended,578900,33754649,Posted: 23 July,all,Shadowsevilfish,"A full choice story game with romance that doesn't control your every move? You better believe it.For the first time, I was actually shocked and delighted such a well designed visual novel existed. With their life-like animated cast, it really added that tiny bit of realism into them, so you didn't feel like you were just talking to a portrait as if you were insane. (Which could be seen as such given that the player speaks with a necklace!) The characters were all fleshed out well and one didn't really need to question much further than what the story and choices would give for you. Really well thought out in the fact that whatever you feel as your own personal reaction will likely be a choice you can make that can alter your 'alignment' throughout your story; which actually does affect how characters react to you, especially your 'necklace'.The story holds strong and may seem a bit fast paced if you're really rushing through to devour the story (which I really do not recommend. We only have 3 chapters!). But it holds a very colorful world and non-cheap backgrounds. The backstory for each character gives you a little bit more insight to the bigger picture, and is in general, worth replaying to test all the choices to find them. (Like how it took me 3 playthroughs to realize my 'necklace' didn't know what a goat was, and 'it' found me pitiful if I was 'kind' to others.) The 2nd main character is made up of your choices(Somewhat), but all in all- is very worth the play to 'meet'.Voice acting was the only SLIGHT negative as it was picked only for some lines, and while sometimes you might expect a line to be spoken, it likely won't be, even if the comedic effect would worked better that way.I personally really loved what was available for this game, and truly and honestly recommend it for people who want to really feel inclusive in a story. I'd also say to buy it before it is complete, as the creators are likely to raise the price."

The visuals are absolutely gorgeous and have been lovingly rendered, the game-play is smooth and I personally experienced nothing in the way of bugs, and the story-telling is absolutely superb -- wonderfully immersive, totally engaging. I was a little leery about the prospect of voice-acting in this visual novel, but was happily surprised -- the characters are so well-voiced that I ended up disappointed that there wasn't MORE voice-acting.Trust me, if you DO happen to be a newcomer to Demonheart, the creator of this story will definitely hook you with her storytelling. The plot is fantastically unique, the characters will suck you in, whether you end up loving or hating them. And Bright, the protagonist you play, feels like such a fleshed-out character, given how many options you're allowed in how you play her and how she reacts to the world around her. It also promises plenty of replay potential.Honestly, the only complaint I have is that I want more! I can't wait for the future chapters! A big ""thank you"" to its creator(s) -- the platform might have changed but this game remains a masterpiece.All in all, Demonheart is delightful and definitely worth the cost. Highly recommended!"
76561198023729112,Recommended,578900,30742421,Posted: 25 March,all,StarGlade,"Bought the game on a whim, wanting to try my first visual novel. So far so good! I feel it left off at a good point as well, on the first chapter. Didn't leave you at a complete cliffhanger, but gave you a tease of what's going to happen next in the story.Well-paced with interesting characters that leave you wanting to know more about them. Does a good job of letting you build your knowledge of the world by updating you with journal entries you can read to gain a deeper insight into the things the story teaches you.I think this was a good game to have as my first visual novel purchase, as now I'm interested in trying out others!"
76561198164956210,Recommended,578900,32907591,Posted: 27 June,all,ladysuzuka,"A visual Novel that have some of my favorite dialouge choices, art and characters to like and hate.Demonheart is has great quailty in its writing, voice acting and art. Especially  for someone like myself who love occult and demon things(honestly there is not enough of them out there). And most of the dialouge choices can actually change the perspective on how the other characters view Bright(The Main Character you will be playing) People an view you as A sweet angel to blood thisty monster, etc.Though if there were issues i would have with the game: while playing some of the  character protraits won't show up(usually happen when i'm doing the ""Good"" route of the game), so it can at times ruin the suspense or leave some people confused.Another thing is the saving system, there is no quick save, there so skip dialounge button for those who are trying other paths. You can make seperate save files for the type of route you're doing but you have to make sure to lable it so you know which one to start from once news chapters are updated to the game.And with only two chapters out so far you can pretty much finish them within 2 hours or less if you just playing through one emotion spector.(Good/Evil/Defiant/Tactful)But if the schedule they tell us is right we should have the other three chapters of this story by the end of 2017. (Here to hoping).  And a cool thing about this game, where others who are releasing chapters as they go may/will charge you an extra fee, this game is a pay once play for all. So you DO NOT have to pay for the other chapters, just let it update the game to get the next one.But i do highly recommend checking this out overall, hopfully they can fix some of the issues i have with the character Protraits."

I'd heard of the NWN module, but never had the opportunity to try it myself - so I was pleased when the VN pulled me into it fairly quickly. The artwork is beautifully done and the story - particularly it's ending - is an intriguing tease of what's to come. Excited for chapter two!"

It's a visual novel without too much interactivity, but gripping nonetheless. Fingers crossed that the next chapter isn't too long in the making."
,Recommended,578900,30762944,Posted: 26 March,all,GregglesStuff,"Love the art style and general asthetic of the game.As you make decisions in conversation you will be informed of how your character is changing/growing. You will get points alloted into certain traits like ""Tactile"" and ""Defiant"" so you get to see how you're progressing in real time which i really enjoyed for a game like this!I hope later chapters have more interactive things to do to break up the game. There is a section in chapter one that requires you to solve a few anagram puzzles which made a very welcome change of pace.Would highly recomend to fans of text adventure games, roleplaying or chose your own adventure fans."
76561198080268954,Recommended,578900,32302952,Posted: 9 June,all,Smoky,"I'm only 2 chapters in and I think this is the best dating sim/visual novel-ish game I've ever played. The character design is gorgeous and the backgrounds are beautiful. I am genuinley interested in my character and the plot. My favourite thing is the amount of options you can make. Instead of just giving you a bare bones 2-4 answer response every once in a while, this game lets you have almost full control of how your character acts. Everything from being a goody-two shoes to a pervert who tries to bed Sir Brash at every chan... I'm getting off topic.The game is a pay once deal and you get all the available chapters and to-be-released chapters. Nothing I've seen is restricted behind mini-transactions or ""sign up on facebook"" type crap which is refreshing.The plot itself is very creative and unique. I won't spoil anything but I really want to know more about Sir Brash (for research purposes ;D) and why his character almost seems to have two personalities. God, I can't wait for the next chapter. The withdrawl may kill me :P"
76561198418624645,Recommended,578900,34942312,Posted: 13 September,all,Nashane9,Lets just say I bought this game three and a half hours ago and i couldn't stop the game till i got to the to be continued point. There are three chapters for now there are supposed to be two more released soon. Demonheart is a story game based on your desissions and multiple out comes. I look forward to the upcoming chapters to see what happens to our heroine (or she could even be a villian based on your desissions) Bright. this game was worth the money paid to play it.

76561198136271833,Recommended,578900,30776974,Posted: 27 March,all,MomentWarden,"I won't lie, I'm a big fan of NWN module and was really excited about the game, even as a visual novel with less mature content. The whole plot was nicely done, with lovely backgrounds and fluid sprite animations, and esp. the music. I really enjoyed the word-riddles, even though I'm not a native english speaker, they were easy and fun to figure out. My only possible complaint would be the chapter length. Even the first chapter in the module was longer than one of the visual novel. Will each chapter be this short? Because I really don't think enough character development will happen in 5 chapters with 1 hour length each. And my favourite thing in the module was definitely the characters and their dynamics. I really hope I'm wrong about this, though."

This is a rare gem to the VN Genre and I can't wait for the new chapters. For once, a female protagonist who doesnt feel like a weak useless babe in the woods."
,Recommended,578900,34420997,Posted: 22 August,all,DA_GamerGal,"I am having such a fun time playing this game! It certainly one of the better written visual novels/otome out there, and is well worth the price IMO.The voice acting (though this is NOT a fully voiced VN) is quite good, as is the artwork, and the character progression - including the MC. What I really appreciate about this VN, is that you are able to shape the personality of the MC through the choices made in her dialogue, and the NPCs will respond accordingly. (Who knew it could be so delightfully fun to be evil?) Also, the music fits each scene nicely and is not too intrusive, or annoying.Another plus, is that the writing is such that the storyline/plot holds your attention with each new chapter, and it is not filled with all those horrible typos and gramatical mistakes that often seem to plaugue most VNs these days.  It also deals with mature themes, which is great for we adults that get tired of reading VN/otome/romance sims geared more to those under 18.On the con side, the chapters could be a little longer and there are minor glitches when the character spites do not show up correctly in some scenes.Overall, I would reccomend this to anyone that enjoys VN/otome/romance sims games."
