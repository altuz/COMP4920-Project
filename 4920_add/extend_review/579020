76561197972282587,Not Recommended,579020,32065771,Posted: 30 May,all,Zymoran,"This game is a reskin of the classic Constructor (1997) and will reviewed as such.Recent stability improvements and hotfixes have addressed most major issues the game had. The thumb down is not for the gameplay, but for some persisting issues which will hopefully be addressed soon.Pros- A few balances to the original game (actual gameplay improvements!)- General UI and input improvements.- Video and sound improvements (in spite of certain bugs and limitations)- Some new on-releasse DLC buildings (this really shouldn't have been a DLC though. Shameless money grab)- Garden-patch introduced more complex / strategic gameplay.Cons- Unstable and almost unplayable multiplayerFIXED- Multiplayer with 2 players frequently desyncsFIXED- Multiplayer with 3 or 4 players desyncs when a player leaves- Significant lag in multiplayer games (varies greatly from player to player)- Long waiting to find public multiplayer lobbies- Poor multiplayer chat features- Frequent crashesFIXED- Construction zoning has been simplified to two mouse clicksFIXED- Cheating AI (similar to classic Constructor)- Launched without the ""mission packs"" (these are promised to be included in later ""weekly"" updates)- Denuvo (not playable offline)VerdictUnfortunately this game is not just a reskin, but a reskin wrapped in DLC, DRM, hundreds of bugs and only sparse selection of gameplay improvements. It is clear that the developers have prioritized aesthetics over stability and gameplay. In the current state, the game is certainly not worth its price for anyone but the most hardcore Constructor fans.Aside from the major issues to be addressed, the game is still very entertaining.Verdict patch 4+The game is now in the playable state one would hope for at the day of the release. This game can be recommended if you enjoy playing against cheating AI or always wanted to try constructor multiplayer. If you're interested in but not familiar with the game, you might want to grab the game on sale.This review will be updated as the developers address the major issues.Patch 1 released June 1st. Addressed none of the issues listed abovePatch 2 released June 5th. Addressed none of the issues listed above. The game now desyncs,making 1v1 unplayablePatch 3 released June 24th. Addressed some issues. Multiplayer not fixedPatch 4 released Juli 27th. Addressed stability and gameplay issues. Multiplayer is now playable"
,Not Recommended,579020,32202946,Posted: 5 June,all,Spork Dude,"I want to preface this review by stating that I really did want to love this game as the original was a favorite of mine as a kid. In this review I will be comparing this game heavily to the original because if this game doesn't at least live up to that--then why play the $30 remake? What is clear to me after playing several hours that this game was not designed with PC in mind. It is quite obviously made for consoles and then ported to PC as an afterthought. This is evident in the control scheme and many aspects of gameplay.Pros- Use of key shortcuts to access menus; ability to right-click to move units easily.- Easily see what tenants are producing looking at the outside of the property.- Menus are small and don't take up the entire screen.- The music. I really like it. I don't remember music in the original; it is a nice touch.- The ability to zoom in and out.- 10 new buildings.- Multiple delivery guys from the Gadget factory.- Undesirables now have cooldowns. This was badly needed.Cons- Auto-zooming is everywhere. Every time you go to place a structure it zooms you out and then back in once you place it. The game zooms way in after building a fence and stays that way, and also zooms out automatically when zooming in elsewhere.- Multiplayer doesn't work very well, and sometimes not at all. Overall very buggy.- Inability to remap buttons. In particular I would like to remap the mouse scroll button from middle click to something on the keyboard.-[FIXED]Volume is inconsistent between different things. Some sound effects are extremely loud and others are quiet with no way independently control the volume for these.- Fence bug. Sometimes your work-team won't rebuild a fence when there's clearly no enemy on the property. This particularly strikes a nerve with me because I must have run into this bug a hundred times in the original game.-[FIXED]AI ignores each other and focuses completely on you. I know it was this way in the original, but I just assumed this small mechanic would be improved.-[FIXED]Awkward building placement using shift+arrow keys, instead of the old triple click method (this one thing is VERY annoying). This was obviously designed with a gamepad in mind.-[FIXED] - You can now increase the enemy build speed.Difficulty. The game is much easier than the original, even on the ""original"" difficulty. I was ready for brick houses and the AI was still building a cement factory.- Denuvo. I personally have nothing against DRM in general. But regarding Denuvo specifically, the cost of implementing this technology is always passed onto the consumer, and more importantly this game could become unplayable should the publisher stop selling this title without removing Denuvo from the game.At the time of this review, the game requires an internet connection to play.A big reason not to buy right here.-[FIXED]Certain estates are too small to accommodate any building.[/url] Once purchased, it is impossible to buy additional estates because you have to utilize the land you have before buying new ones.- The $30 price tag. This price might have flown 20 years ago. But the current indie game market, particularly on Steam, is extremely saturated, with $30 being on the higher end of indie titles.Minor Nitpicks- The art style. Not a huge fan of the new style of art, especially the menus and such. Much of it looks dated or cartoony and doesn't invoke a lot of nostalgia in me.- Map scroll speed is a bit too slow for me even at the highest setting, and the map scrolls significantly faster left to right than it does up and down.- Strange mouse smoothing on cursor movement. (A common occurrence with bad PC ports)- Cannot click outside the of certain menus to escape the screen, but can on others. Very inconsistent.- No ability to scroll lists using mouse, must use arrow keys or click the arrow buttons.- Work-teams can not be called to do work elsewhere if they are idle inside a factory. This differs from the original.- Paying an undesirable and then cancelling causes him to go on cooldown even if you never sent him anywhere.- I was really hoping for some additional content, something that would really set this game apart from the original. A campaign mode or a new undesirable would have been cool to see.And finally, not really a complaint about the game, but I would list the unacceptable behavior by members of System 3 when interfacing with the public. Calling their fans trolls, deleting comments, blocking people, and engaging in arguments is unacceptable. I was personally blocked on their facebook pageafter this interaction(my comments in red).VerdictThis game has huge potential, but ignoring the PC base, releasing the game unfinished and bug-ridden, and neglecting to add enough features to distinguish it from the original means I unfortunately cannot recommend it in its current state. Perhaps one day this game will be great, but not today.I will periodically revisit this review as the game gets patched.[June 30, 2017 Update]- The latest patch has fixed some of the issues stated in this review, however, there are still too many issues for me to recommend this game at this time."

How dare them release the game like this.. after being delayed for months. Well, I guess that's how you ruin a validated good ol' game.AMATEUR'S RELEASE! SHAME ON YOU, SYSTEM 3.Wait to see if they're gonna fix it. Otherwise it's not worth it right now."
,Not Recommended,579020,31982622,Posted: 26 May,all,Blackadder,"I did give this game a good review but on further reflection I honestly cannot recommend it in its current form.The overall quality is okay but honestly, after spending 6 hours I have a few issues:1. The AI is exactly the same as the classic game and therefore gets very repetitive and boring2. The AI players will only mess around with you, they do not interact with one another (very much like the orginal) this leaves me frustrated and uninterested in pursuing another round.3. You will be bombarded with constant council missions, literally the worst aspect of the classic.4. No new features, same content as original game. You would have thought that they could have at least added a few new undesirables but nope.5. Missions ""coming soon""6. The audio when entering some of the buildings is far too loud, for example the bikers building. I appreciate using the orginal audio but they could have tweaked it a bit so it doesn't make your ears bleed.7. Multiplayer is dead, not really the developers fault but this could have been the games strongest point for a modern audience.8. Pricing, £24.99 is far too steep. If it was priced lower there could have been the prospect of more players to play with but nope. I feel ripped off as this is simply a HD skin pack for the classic game. (which I already have several copies of!)Maybe buy it when its on sale for half the price. Even then be cautious as you could get the same experience and gameplay from the classic game for less.Don't think i'll bother buying another game from this developer, they really didn't do their research."

76561198007589353,Not Recommended,579020,32010142,Posted: 27 May,all,NeXuS,"I am a bit confused.I was a huge fan of this game back in 1998. And when I heard it is coming back I became happiest gamer in steam lol. But after playing for 2 days... I dont know how to describe my feelings right way. From one hand it is the same constructor with the same tennants, undesirables and their non-stop whinings. From another hand I feel like its not the same, moreover - its something very weird and alien. I'll try to describe:1. Tennants do not auto-populate buildings anymore. It is pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to populate them manually every time someone dies. It greatly increases micromanagement, and not in a good way.2. Some sounds are too loud and weird. Also, new crying sound when tenant dies, is awful.3. There are a lot of bugs with tenant quests. When it meets requirements, but it doesnt count. I hardly keep white/black mark balance, thanks to the town council quests. Bugs when workers cannot complete building, because it says there are enemies on the site, but there are not. Bugs with police, sometimes they cancel all patrols and return back. Sometimes, police officers show weird large number in efficiency and doesnt move. Bugs, bugs. bugs4. Again, it was said many times. But it is really important, releasing the game without planned multiplayer support? Weird move.5. The game has different speeds and I dont know why. I cannot control big city on lowest speed, because I cannot click so fast to do all micromanage tasks. How should fast-forward help the player is a secret for me.I cannot recommend this game, despite being a fan, I remember how much monthes were spent playing constructor on PS. But after playing this, I dont want to launch it anymore. I'll check it from time to time, to see if something changed. At least if they'll fix bugs and add multiplayer.P.S. Never thought I could possibly say this, but Constructor 2, so hardly criticised by everyone back in 2000, even myself, looks a lot better than this game now. Lets see what changes..."

,Not Recommended,579020,32029029,Posted: 28 May,all,Tatsumasa,"Gives a true sense of nostalgia if you have played the original, but that is about where the fun ends. After playing new games that have evolved past the UI this provides, you will quickly see the faults. A big gripe I have is for how much you have to micro manage, most of the screens are many levels deep. For example, the game requires a lot of managing of estates such as upgrading the rooms in them... well to do that, you first have to 1) click on the house 2) click a button to go to manage property 3) click ANOTHER button to go to room upgrades 4) click another button to pick bedroom 5) finally click a button to upgrade it 6) thought you were done? click another button to call work crew. So truly nothing is 1 menu deep and you will find yourself wading thru a lot of these screens that hide your view of any action going on in the town.Additionally, at the time of this review (may 2017), multiplayer does not work well. Crashes in 3-4 players, sometimes crashes in other modes too. Sometimes regular game crashes and there is no auto save so you lose a lot of progress. Cannot recommend at this time."
76561197981854209,Not Recommended,579020,31991325,Posted: 27 May,all,spodcrotch,"Trying to join a multiplayer lobby immediately crashes the game.There are no proper resolution options - at best, it just stretches the fixed resolution which then makes everything look blurry. This is despite the devs promising that there would be resolution options in the final game after everybody complained about the demo.On the plus side, there are lots of general improvements. There's a button to repair your fence at factories when they've been attacked by foremen. There are a lot of keyboard shortcuts and there are small touches like how when you upgrade rooms, you can queue higher level upgrades to the same room rather than having to wait for the workmen to finish. You can add workers to a foreman while another team is in the HQ because there's now a separate row for unassigned workers rather than risking taking workers from your other teams.At the same time, there are some strange omissions in the new UI. For instance, everything else has a keyboard shortcut but the HQ screen doesn't. It's annoying having to click in the top left of the screen. There are no keyboard controls to use the arrows to choose the rooms you want to upgrade so you still have to use the mouse a lot because you can only use the keyboard for 50% of the things. I can't understand why someone didn't realise it would make sense to just let you use the arrow keys if nothing else.The wording of the original complaints has been shortened, presumably because they're now voice acted but it would have been nice to keep the original text since in almost every other respect, this is a straight remake.Finally, this is subjective but I would say that the graphics of the remake don't have the same charm as the original. You can see that from the screenshots and decide for yourself though. There are a few other annoying touches like changing the look of the repairman despite keeping the original audio.If you're like me and you've been playing the original Constructor in Dosbox for years, I'd recommend not buying this and just playing the original. I'm probably going to refund."
76561197963927510,Not Recommended,579020,32138402,Posted: 2 June,all,Matthamy,"It pains me to write this but I can’t recommend this game.  As a massive fan of the original I wanted to love this re-make but alas, as the other reviews say it really is just a poorly attempted re-skin.  The game has completely lost all its charm.  Yes, some effort was made with new jokes after completing each building material phase and redesigning the tenants and giving them voices is a great addition but it wasn’t the big overhaul that people expected.There are the same issues as the original has 10 years ago.•	Computer A.I not interacting with one another is a real pain I really thought that would have been looked at.•	Having to micro manage tenants becomes tedious, especially when your empire starts to get bigger some sort of automation there could have changed the monotony of this.•	No verity in council missions so the game becomes very repetitive very quickly.I think the only thing that can save Constructor is if the devs open it up to the steam workshop and let the community add the content they so desperately want to see in the game.System 3 had a great opportunity to fix everything that was wrong with the original release, which wasn’t a lot to be fair but instead have managed to remove the essence of what made the game so popular 10 years ago and added a crazy number of bugs that cause the game to crash out straight to desktop more often than a game that was a year late really ought to.  Which is impressive seeing as they haven’t seemed to change much of the games original code.I really wanted to love this game, but they have really dropped the ball here and disappointed a lot people in the process.  I really wanted to see some tweaks to the game mechanics and that balancing of game play the devs promised.I’m going to continue to try and give this game another chance but that’s purely driven by nostalgia.  If you didn’t play this game as a child it’s not worth it.  Hopefully they can bring an update that can please the community that stuck by waiting for this game to be released."

76561198070591452,Recommended,579020,31977681,Posted: 26 May,all,Ejl,"Pretty much the same as it was, just upgraded to modern standards in terms of graphics and controls. All the classic sound effects are there, familiar tenants with their problems and mannerisms.  Even though i never understood what was going on in this game as a kid, i still loved this. It had some certain charm, maybe because the wacky tenants, or a gangster wielding a minigun was fun to me as a youngster.--------------------For the old players--------------------This is pretty much the exact same game, and i don't mind at all! It's everything that i've (and you have!) missed, if you're a returning player you can skip the tutorial and start right away, you know what to do.  Graphics are just better, and gameplay is a lot smoother in general. This a great remake, don't waste your time with the original anymore.--------------------For the new ones who aren't familar with Constructor--------------------Instead of games like Cities skylines, simcity etc, we have an unique tenant in every house, they can either give birth to new ones or pay rent. This is the first problem, we need both money and people so balancing in this issue is a must right from the beginning. 5 different tenant classes, from the poor to the uberly rich elitists. There are no easy tenants, they are drunken hillbillies or pothead students in the beginning, and demanding rich people in the end complaining about the strangest things.In addition to that, the council gives us tasks which have to be fulfilled, and depending on your selections, you can have up to 3 enemy towns messing up your businesses with gangsters, hippies, burglars and few other undesirables who can all perform 4 different actions to cause harm. Of course, you can mess up their towns as well (and you should) to keep them from winning the game.Planning your layout is pretty basic by today's standards. We can only do rectancle or square lots, but the decorations make up for it. We have trees, garden gnomes, sheds and others to sprinkle at the yards. All of you aesthetic-enthusiastics also have something to do here. Just keep in mind that this isn't Simcity, or cities skyline. It's still way more than your average RTS.We have a few game modes featuring different goals, gaining enough money in a set amount of time, an all out war, utopian state (all residents happy) and of course a free build. Unfortunately, not many maps but they're all diverse, with increasing challenge levels in available land, forcing you to advance agressively and fast. Hopefully we get more as a free update. Hard-difficulty really is hard. You will have problems even on normal.I haven't tested out the multiplayer yet, so this is purely done based on the SP-experienceThis is a day one review everything has worked for 5 hours straight (yep, i've played it a lot already!) no bugs encountered. FPS stays at 60 on 1920x1080.Should you buy it?ABSOLUTELY! The fun characters, many ways to play and many different things to try encourage replayability, good graphics and smooth gameplay, wacky tenants that you will not find in any other game and sending a killer clown to wreak havoc in your neighbouring town is something that not many other games offer."

I really enjoyed that game and about 5 years ago wanted to play it again but could not reminisce the name of the game. Recently I found Constructor in my reccomendation list and bought it straight away for around 17 USD, and another 8 USD for Mob rule and Old fashioned Constructor.I did not enjoy new Constructor, since it was not really optimized and had no campaign. But I read the game thread and found out that devs are aware of the problems and are working on it. I just decided that I will wait for some time and enjoy ot later. Unfrotuanately, it was a big challenge for me to play old school game since control movement was way too bad. But what I was ready for this, since the game is 20 years old!Today there is an update for new Constructor, nothing global, still no campaign, few bug fixes and a new DLC for 3 USD!! I have already paid 25, and they want another 3 for few bew houses? have never claimed for a refund, but i am really considering it.I found Constructor buggy, boring and I think it is a rip off, there are many much more user friendly and bug-free games for such money.I have a feeling that Devs are trying to make money on our nostalgy.

76561198029187467,Not Recommended,579020,32224749,Posted: 6 June,all,RicardoF,"Overall: It's a great game after all. It is, still, the same game as the classic version. But the reasons I explained below make this one just not worth buying at all. If you are willing to spend that money on this game, please get the classic version so you won't have your expectations ruined. Or if you really want to get this one, wait until it's on sale for about $10 or $15.Graphics: it is a great idea to bring the game's looks to a new, more recent state. However, the developers and graphical designers stopped evolving by 2010, and this version delivers exactly that. The game has far outdated graphics, and that is NOT the worst: most animations and cutscenes are poorly made, without the least care with realism. If you watch the short movie when launching the game, you'll notice it when the worker just look like a ghost inside the concrete. Also, Character animation videos in-game are carelessly made, without even sync between lips movement and sound.Sound: ridiculously outdated. They just got the same audios from the classic version, and put them to play where they belong. At least, it would be expected from them to rework all the sounds for the price they're charging.Gameplay: of course, it is 90% just equal to the classic version. However, the developers worked on a gamepad-compatibility feature, that actually didn't worked well. The gamepad's cursor movement is too sensitive, and there are excessive shortcuts for too few buttons they decided to use. In my case, I haven't found a single use for the top-side buttions and triggers, and this wastes like 50% of the controller's potential. Added to this, the foundation placement is extremely poorly designed: they tried to let the game define construction sites placement somewhat automatic, but it actually ruined the freedom players had when defining the layout of each estate, and this actually ruins the game's optimization techniques some players developed when playing the classic version. If they revert this to let it fully manual, then the game's gameplay experience would return to perfection on keyboard ad mouse."

Save your money and by something decent instead.
,Not Recommended,579020,32518380,Posted: 17 June,all,Asser,"Well... The game itself is not bad. It's a complete HD reskin of the original Constructors from back in the day. The new game looks gorgeous, but there is, some flaws with this game. The UI for once, and it's probably also my biggest. They've clearly tried to redo the user interface in a more 2017 style which for the most part works... sort of ok?I don't know if it's because I just can't find that menu, but I miss having the mini map from the orignal that would have flashing lots for empty buildings for instance.. The UI doesn't really feel well thought out. It seems like they've taken the original game and then just revamped it somewhat haphazardly. I mean the keyboard navigation improvements are nice but please make the keys rebindable!! It's really frustrating to not being able to use WASD for navigation instead of the arrow keys.I also hoped to see some minor gameplay improvements like not having to manually move new people into a house where the previous family died of old age. The ability to permanently assigining a crew to a factory for instance.So comparing this to the original. Is it worth it? Well... it depends. I don't think it is. It's the exact same game, it runs more smoothly and looks better, but it doesn't really have the same charm as the original did. That might just be nostalgia on my part though."

I can only choose between 16:9 or Fullscreen... cannot resize the UI, toggle the auto zoom, nothing...

Surely we deserve a more 'complete' game? it would've been better to just delay it again and get things done properly. True fans would've waited and now most of us have a bitter taste in our mouths.

They've made a few enhancements that the original game was always lacking like your maintenance guy actually repairing undesirable buildings automatically and the map always being visible.  The game sometimes randomly crashes, so there's still a few bugs they have to fix - although this has only happened to me after playing a loaded saved game for about 10-20 minutes.  I haven't had a chance to try multiplayer yet. System 3 says they will continue to patch the game to fix all the errors and add additional maps to play and such. This was my first and favorite RTS game I ever played and this is a wonderful refresh of that original game. The few problems the game has doesn't make the game unplayable, I just save my progress every 15-20 mins just in case it happens to crash, but it's only happened twice to me so far in 10hrs of gameplay."

But thanks to BrightPaw (thank you dude), there is someone who maintains a connection between the producers and the gamers. So here are my two cents:- The game is expensive. Many customers demand a flawless game for such a sum.- On Win10, I5, 8gbRAM, GT1060, I had three crashes in 10 hours of game.- I play on Nvidia Surround and it pisses me that in 2017 I don't have custom resolutions.- The game responds really bad at Alt+Tab. Sometimes it shows only blank screen when returning from desktop.- I have small issues with the mouse movement and sound.- No campaign, no missions, at least for the moment. Few maps.+ The game is hard, and the AI cheats a lot. But if you beat them on Original, you get that special victory feeling.+ The interface is a little improved from the original. Keyboard shortcuts were added.+The devs have promised that they will continue working on the game, even downloadable content.+ Funny graphics, strong gameplay, both well combined with the sound.+ Great strategy/tycoon game.+ The fact that I loved the game before is a bonus. I would love the game even if I hadn't played it before.In my opinion, it worth the money. I'm happy with the purchase and I love the new game. I'll love it even more after the updates."

The AI mechanics are just as unforgiving as they were in 1997 which is great, the graphics have had a complete overhaul with a lot of the original sound bytes re-used making for a full nostalgia effect if you've played the original.Couple of minor changes the most noticable is the laying of buildings, with the original you laid the fence then placed the building plot, now you can just right click to rotate and the game attempts to automate the size of the plot for you, letting you pull back the fence slightly but when your cursor gets close to the other side of the road, it attempts to snap to it and rotate the building 180 degrees, this maybe to cater to consoles.The next change is one i quite like to the UI, you can now commit cash to upgrade rooms to the highest level without waiting for your work team to complete the previous tier of room resulting in less time spent in the menu upgrading rooms.While the AI can be quite tiresome with the council missions, they're consistent but the more you move through the tiers you can quickly learn what each specific tenant from each tier has for their expectations from a home and garden perspective. This results in being able to pre-empt a lot of tenant complaints.If you've never played the original game.Constuctor is a very unique resource management building game with some quirky British builder humor and Italian mob humor throw into the mix. You begin your game with a couple of Foreman', Repair men and a handful of workers, which you will use to build factories to produce the wood to construct wood huts. Then you'll need to move in some tenants to your houses and meet their specific needs, be it planting them some trees and garden furniture, tending to their security requirements or upgrading their rooms.Tenants will either pay rent or once your tenants get about to making kids you can give them a computer or school nearby to let them produce educated kids to move up to the next tier of buildings and tenants. Then so forth through more tiers of bricks and steel, all the while trying to keep your tenants happy or they will report you to the Council who will mark your performance down possibly resulting in being fired, Game Over.But while juggling all of these mechanics, an unforgiving 90's AI with no remorse will constantly berate you with undesirables like the Hippy who will picket your factories, squat in your To Let properties to disrupt your work and tenant happiness. Or Mr Fixit who will flood your properties by ""Fixing"" your plumbing, mess with your electrics to cause damage or even remove a gas oven to cause maximum collateral damage to your surrounding properties.You can also fight back with your own deadly array of undesirables but be warned some tenants won't like living next to a hippy or thugs from the high rise. You can also fight back with your own police force by having level 2 tenants commit to police time instead of paying their rent which can then be put to good use patroling your neighbourhoods with police who will arrest any enemy undesirables on sights before they can do any major damage to your properties. But you may also need to build a prison to keep them all for fear of overcrowding will just let them straight back onto the streets.With various game modes to mix it up forcing you to focus on specific goals like Utopia, All out War or just Build Build Build, it should keep you coming back for more if you like a genuine challenge with little to no hand holding in your games. Which forces you to try to test and learn the right balance and mix to keep everyone happy, alive and paying rent."

I reluctantly said ""YES"" to recommending this game, but it was very much a 50/50 call.I got into the game and felt like some of the elements I enjoy were present -- building properties, managing issues, building my empire, etc.However, it feels like I spend a lot of time listening to annoying game sounds and dealing with nonsense scenarios that the game throws out at you -- upgrades galore, and they all want something. And, sometimes its cryptic in nature too.One aspect I really want to try is multiplayer, which I never could do on Mob Rule. But if I have to deal with human players coming at me from all angles and some tenant complaining that they don't like their fence, it might just break my spirit. This could entirely be my own faults and inability to do what I want to do in this game -- focusing on building an empire versus dealing with the nitty gritty of fence upgrades -- but this remains to be seen."

Also it is massively challenging.The Bad: Tenant complain way to much, it negatively affects the experience if you have many.
