76561198017103126,Recommended,579110,32836931,Posted: 26 June,all,William_Congreve,"I wanted the full experience of stumbling around an unknown spaceship desperately trying to work out how to survive long enough to reenter correctly without dying, so I selected hard mode to start with. This mode disables a little tutorial describing the spaceship at the beginning of the game, and also removes hilighting on which buttons to push.In hard mode, I died twice, and then landed safely after about an hour of gameplay, at which point the game was basically done. I tried to aim the spaceship retrograde and deorbit manually far ahead of the script, but it didn't do anything. As far as I can tell, the spaceship is on rails (you can't actually fly and watch the oribital mechanics play out; you have one path and you die if you get too far off it).I can still hartily reccomend the game, though, because for the ~1 hour of gameplay, it did really feel like flying a spaceship, and it was awesome. Figuring out how things worked in hard mode was panic-filled and I died twice, but that's the fun of the adventure. I RECCOMEND ALL PLAYERS PLAY ON HARD MODE THE FIRST TIME. Having buttons hilighted when you need to press them takes away the main gameplay mechanic: figuring out how the spaceship works. On easy mode, you just follow the linear course of events, and working the fiddly life-support system quickly becomes frustrating. On hard mode, you need to think and work fast but also carefully to learn how to fly the spaceship without breaking it or running out of time. On easy mode, it's a movie that you have to play minigames to continue. On hard mode, it's a game.tl;dr: Only one hour of gameplay, but very fun. Play on hard mode; easy mode takes away too much gameplay and makes it boring."

76561197966513979,Recommended,579110,32800318,Posted: 25 June,all,Perfect Consumer,"This is a short, but highly endearing game about the space race where you play as a hapless Kosmonaut struggling to juggle the controls of a rusted out Russian capsule.  The sense of presence is pretty strong considering the stationary location, but I didn't feel that my hands were oriented correctly on either the Vive or the Touch (this is motion controls only) and my body felt like it was hovering a bit higher than it should have even after recentering the view - not that either of these things greatly effected my  overall enjoyment.  The banter from your handlers in mission control are comical, and the slapdash nature of the whole affair makes this game something fun to pull out when friends pop by to check out some VR.  I also want to try playing the game again in Hard difficulty, now that I feel more comfortable, but I'd say the $5 I spent on this little gem was worth it for even just the initial hour long playthough I had on easy difficulty.  It's an amusing little experience that would not be possible without VR, and I can recommend it for it's humor and sense immersion."
76561197971692751,Recommended,579110,34620513,Posted: 30 August,all,Delle(DK),"A fun little game worth the 5 euro.as you can see in the video you are in a space capsul, and your goal is to land on earth.You will be given some instructions to follow but you soon will realize that there are some hard choises to makesince the radio operator(s) have a different view upon things. And it dosent help that Nasa try to contact you and ask you to do things while Russia say something els... it is up to you to deside what you want to do sometimes ;-)But all in all what you do in the game is sit in your capsul and open/close your oxygen, flip some switchen, and reset fuses.And at some point you have to aim your capsul in the right direction and click some other buttons.On easy level some of the keys light up when you have to press them.Most of the time the story and buttons lighten up and are easy to find, while other times you can get a bit confused.The game is funny ( the audio / story ) .. the game feel like you get a new command every 30 seconds... Check oxygen, overpresure release gas, change to backup power ect ect ect.  do this and do that all the way from start to finish.As you progress in the story it will unlock so you in the main menu can quick start  and example try again where you died.I would not say the game have that much replay value, but you might be interested in trying to complete the story in one go without dying.For the 5 euro it cost It is a nice short experience. For 5 euro you should try it though you maybe only play it a few times.- Bad things..well I think the graphics are not that good and grumsy, would be nice to be able to adjust it and get a better picture( increase super sampling )- I think the part about the landing gear is a bit comfusing, dont really know where the disable landing gear button is even though i managed to land on earth ;-)TIP..: The best way to control your oxygen and presure, is to turn the handle near your left knee, and look left and avoid overpresure... now stop, and look right and see if you can reduce the c02 level and fill more in your tank.. Just keep looking left and right and you refil without much problems.And note that you do not have to run all systems on your primary battery, but example can make one of them run on the backup so you avoid over voltage. :-)Ps.. Played with Oculus rift + touch controlers. working.. you can grab things, and click buttons with one finger."

,Recommended,579110,32806318,Posted: 26 June,all,Skeleboners,"Really neat, solid little VR thing. Definitely on the short side, and it pulls its punches in places I wish it wouldn't (for example: if you deploy your parachutes while in space, you just get a black screen that describes what you did wrong- I'd really prefer to be able to sit through the reentry and descent as the capsule plummetted to Earth at some ridiculous speed). Still, it's like $5 and there are plenty of switches to play with, and it's pretty immersive (esp. if you press the ""helmet stays"" button in the menu)"
,Recommended,579110,31376099,Posted: 26 April,all,warriorscot,"Price is ok and the game looks fantastic, just the kind of experience that should have been the norm for VR right from the start. It is buggy though, in my short play through I experienced several including one fatal bug that prevented progress. Given the price that's tolerable as it should be fixable by the devs. Hopefully this is just the start of more similar experiences."
76561197972053813,Recommended,579110,31365395,Posted: 25 April,all,Frankenberry,"I truly enjoyed playing in this fictional Soviet spacecraft hurtling across planet earth, pulling levers switches and pushing buttons that do important things.  Lot's of fun and after a bunch of deaths made it safely back to earth!Sound design was great, and helped with immersion. From radio chatter with ground control to the chunky metal clanks of buttons levers switches and hatches or the hiss of leaking gasses and electrical shorts.The instructions over the radio were good, as I frantically searched for the needed buttons\ panels in russian and little english subtitled labels.Loved how I felt busy keeping myself alive.For 4.99 Interkosmos delivers a lot for space junkies, and/or button nerds. (Me) I truly felt like I was in charge of my destiny in this tin can. I had some difficulty with my virtual hands switching on or off certain buttons/covers which made things more tense but a bit frustrating. Hopefully we will see some control tweaks.I wish I had seen some ingame death sequences which would have added much more replayability other than a simple text explanation as to what I did wrong.I do wish this experience is expanded and polished up as it's fun and addictive.Now back to floating in my tin can."

,Not Recommended,579110,32575164,Posted: 19 June,all,CornDog,"Fantastic concept. Fun to play. but absurdly frustrating. It has this loop that happens every 30ish seconds that is fun the first two times it happens, then it starts being annoying:0. Get yelled at by Russian that the pressure is too high1. fight with the stupid hitbox issues so you can turn the valves to release the pressure.2. finally open the valves.3. try to close the valves, (this is usually easier than step 2 if you don't take your hands off them)4. Get yelled at by Russian that your O2 levels are too low.5. refill the O2 you just vented into space. (again, with hitbox combat)6. Get yelled at by Russian that your O2 levels are too high.7. Vent atmosphere into space.8. Get yelled at by Russian that you are off course.9. fight with the absurdly fiddly joystick to get back on course10. Repeat steps 9 and 10 4 times.11. GoTo 0. (by this time its taken so long to do all the other steps that the pressure is too high again.)If you are lucky enough (and skilled enough) to get all that done in good time, get ready to do it all again in about 30 seconds.And it never stops. You have to do that same thing over and over again. sometimes you get a break from the yelling Russian because other story line audio clips start playing so you get some brief respite. But you will never be free of it.If they get rid of this stupid feedback loop, or at least make it so it is FAR LESS frequent, AND fix all the fiddly issues with collisions for the control panels, Then I recommend you play this game. Because it is beautiful, and a great concept.NOTE TO POTENTIAL VR GAME DEVS: You SHOULD play this game, despite its issues. Because this core concept is a great thing that we need more of in VR. and while this one has been executed poorly, there's a lot to learn for us game devs."

,Recommended,579110,31569583,Posted: 5 May,all,Prominence,"Fun game. I'm glad the game doesn't leave you on your own as far as the controls go. You're always told what to do, at least so far. I love the worn out look to everything, it makes the ship feel more real. Which by the way, I also like the nice visuals and non-blocky cartoon look. Good stuff.My overview ==>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr8IDGaztSs"

Fuses fixed but still no power to screen.  Very annoying.  No help.  Just keeps telling me to use joystick but I can't see the trajectory screen.  Nothing works.   Cant proceed in game.  Anyone else have this?

,Not Recommended,579110,31368339,Posted: 25 April,all,Elcmar,"Not really fun. Many bugs (audio loop mainly), very short & not much to see. Don't recommend it, even for space fan like me.(And don't listen to the resume here, there's no ""comedic story full of twists, international intrigues & Cold War absurdities""."

,Recommended,579110,31433736,Posted: 29 April,all,zirconium3,"Very cool, a bit short and a bit buggy (with the button pressing), and a little bit laggy (GTX980), polished graphics all the same."
76561197993293102,Recommended,579110,31466595,Posted: 30 April,all,Rambu,"Upfront you should be aware that his is not a long game.  It takes about 15-20 minutes to complete the landing sequence. BUT it is priced appropriately.This is the  best VR experiance I have ever had. You put on the headset and are immediatly surrounded by conrtol panels and dials, all of which you manipulate with your real hands.  They use a retro, soviet style in e  very clever way to make the switches bulkier than normal so they are easier to use in VR, but you don't really notice.I would gladly pay $60 for this game if it had more missions.  I really hope they come up with a sequal, because as of right now they have a full-featured cockpit that can accuratly simulate anything a Soyuz capsul can do, so making more missions shuoldn't be that hard.I must also say that sometimes the headset lost position in the cockpit (1 button push to fix)(happens on average 1 time every ten minute play thru) and it's a bit tricky to hit a few of the virtual switches.This is the best VR experiance I've ever had and it's a great way to introduce your friends to seated VR - though the archery game in The Lab is the best introduction to roomscale."
76561198009371606,Recommended,579110,31473144,Posted: 30 April,all,Dash,"Loved every minute of this, and will play it again!!!Just what I've wanted from VR since I first got a Vive. I only wish there were more buttons and switches to mess around with. If struggling with buttons valves and levers while trying to land an unfamiliar space ship sounds fun to you, get this game. Well worth the money!"
,Recommended,579110,31638361,Posted: 8 May,all,Nit Pick,"I'm giving this a very weak reccomendation. It feels like an Early Access game when it isn't.The graphics are great but unoptimized to a point where there's lag in the hands. It's an OK sitdown experience with some chuckles here and there. There is 17 achievements and I beat the 20-40ish minute game with both endings. I got none of them. That part eludes me.The hands in the game lag as I've said before. The main menu has a demonstration controller that shows what button does what. It sits right in front of the player and it has physics, meaning it's in the way of the main menu. The fingers on the gloves have a large hit box and the switches are tiny. So there is a lot of 'fingers too fat' situations where I had to jam my sausage fingers (heh) in the switches to make them flip. Too often where I make too frantic movements, I accidently press something and kill myself. The buttons are highlighted so I know what to press, it is just nearby another button that I'm not supposed to press. Knowing what to press and unable to press it causes the Russians to repeat the same command over and over again. So jank buttons + fat fingers + laggy hands + annoying Russian command center = frustrations.It is redundant to bring up 'at least the price is ok' because I don't think the price justifies buying this. The win screen looks pretty half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on both endings. The ""You Win"" part looks like it was cobbled together with rectangle brick primatives in  the unreal engine.I'd say, wait until they patch it or get a beefier computer. My computer is pretty beef, it can handle Rick and Morty and Job Simulator but I do not know what to think about this one. It seems polished but it needs a good spit shine here and there to be worthy of the $5 price."

This game goes from a DO NOT BUY... TO A MUST BUYOLD REVIEW : I do not want to give a negative review, but the bugs, and horrible controls have earned it, and unfortunately it wont change until its patched. In its CURRENT state, this game is NOT FINISHED, and NEEDS SERIOUS WORK.if it is FINISHED, and MORE WORK is put into it... fix the BUGS, CONTROLS, and it seems... add OCULUS SUPPORT..it will be FANTASTIC."

,Recommended,579110,34241480,Posted: 14 August,all,The Coyote,Only played this game once and died after one hour for some reason I am not totally sure of. Will hopefully not make the same mistake when entering atmosphere the next time I try. And even if I never play this game again (but I will) it will still be worth the purchase for that one hour. It was a fun story (so far) delivered by com radio messages.
76561198026195360,Recommended,579110,34479466,Posted: 25 August,all,BB,"Short but cheap. More of an entertaining experience rather than a full blown game.Too much accent but mostly humorous.Controls need a bit more work: it's a seated experience but requires a significant amount of room to move as the controls are all around you.Overall, another quirky addition to my library.Recommended at this price ($4.99)Tried in Oculus Rift on 1080Ti. HQ FX was left on with 2:1 pixel override in Oculus debug tool. No graphics issue was noticed.With all the English labels tucked on Russian language instruments, Clint Eastwoods Firefox came to mind: ""Think in Russian, think in Russian"" :)"

76561197965004501,Recommended,579110,35007389,Posted: 16 September,all,cloister56,"This game took me back to 688 attack sub. Lots of buttons with russian writing on, and me with no idea what to press next :)On easy mode it does a great job of introducing you to all the commands, turning the indecipherable collection of panels and switches into something managable that you can understand. I'm looking forward to trying the hard mode and attempting to get my capsule home in one piece.The motion controls can be a little figgity but generally flicking switches and pushing buttons have a nice weight to them and function as planned 90% of the time.This was a great experience and a good game at a very reasonable price. I would recommend it to anyone with a VR rig."
,Recommended,579110,35321318,Posted: 29 September,all,Tanedin,"Very cool little game.  Short, but 100% worth the asking price.The story is fun and well crafted, the graphics are quite good, and the chunky soviet aesthetic lends itself well to VR.Interkosmos is not perfect though.The replayability and branching storyline seem like a bit of an oversell; I didn't find that the various death states were really distinct enough for that.That being said, it is still worth a couple of playthroughs, and at 30 minutes per trip, you've got a good overall playtime for a $5 title.Additionally, flipping switches with the Vive controllers can sometimes be a little difficult.  Moving the VR gloves a little further down on the controller might help, could use some kind of calibration option to allow players to find their own sweet spot.Interkosmos will probably become my new ""intro to VR"" game.A solid 9/10 experience and a good value."

Some random events might prolong the game a bit so won't feel so short. Great as the demo for people interested in VR capabilities.
