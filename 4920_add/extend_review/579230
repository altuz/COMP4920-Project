It's actually awesome and very enjoyable!+Visuals: ThatLamaAlpaca runs so gracefully I can't contain myself, it's outstanding. Pixel art is very well done, and those *hats* are actually skins, you would not believe who is there, like Sailor Alpaca, and JojoPaca, and even more I haven't unlocked yet, wow, they are nice, I hope more coming <3 OH I forgot to mention blooming sakura's everywhere.+Soundwork: Only 2 8-bit music tracks so far but they are okay (Not the Robot Unicorn Attack level but still enjoyable)+Gameplay: You have to actually play with a mouse because you have to aim your lazor. Yes, you are a laser shooting lama, while jumping from one platform to another you also blaze everything into the dust.Oh, and different Alpacas have different laser beams!+Steam cards - JUST LOOK AT DEM PICTURES+Achievements-No controls remap-Sometimes the game freezes upon quitting, yet your progress is safe even if your game is crashed sooo... whatever.+THE PRICELong story short, It is a value for money game, So much fun and Hairy Sailor of the Bloody Moon!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=849738015And remember kids - Don't lose your way and don't be afraid!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=849725772"

,Recommended,579230,29591768,Posted: 30 January,all,MastaCody of 99 Cent Gaming,"I personally purchased this game. I reviewed it for my 99 Cent Gaming series.(Just to note real quick, the original video was recorded on release day so I made a quick update video to reflect the fixes made by the developer. Thank you for caring about your game!}What I love about doing my reviews of 99 cent games are the many different genres that can come out of the category. While there aren't many gems that come out of the low-budget spectrum, there are games that do a pretty decent job of giving people who love a certain style of games to have more to sink their teeth into. That sums of Alpacapaca Dash for me.This is the first endless runner I've played since I on Steam (that I can remember) but I've played COUNTLESS of them on mobile devices, and while most of them were F2P they had a certain ""one more run"" aura about them that made you want to keep playing for better upgrades, great unlocks, and ultimately bragging rights on being the longest distance runner of them all. Alpacapaca Dash isn't F2P but manages to touch on a few of those points for me, but what about those still looking for an entry point to the genre?Alpacapaca Dash is an endless runner that sports both platforming challenges and enemies to avoid and destroy. Platforming is self explainitory, but you get LASERS to fend off bats, blobs, and snakes. Along the way you can rack up coins to unlock costumes while working your way up through the leaderboards. Let me break it down.First, here's what I've enjoyed about the game. It definitely hits on those ""one more run"" addictive traits due to the game keeping track of your furthest distance and putting them on a global leader board for bragging rights. A lot of low-budget games that require quick thinking don't have that option which cuts down replayability, so I'm happy to see it here. Another addition that helps with the desire to keep playing is getting coins that unlock different characters to play as during your runs. Now I haven't unlocked everything in the game, but from what I've seen they are purely cosmetic...and very very cute.Secondly. here is where I'd like to see improvements. As a personal preference I would have loved to see controller support due to the control scheme being very confusing for me...at first. The developer has since updated the game to allow key rebinding which is a godsend, but controller support would still be pretty neat. Another thing I would like to see is allowing the coins you get to be used on upgrading your powerups. Let me use the Jumper save more than once if I upgrade it. Let the laser be homing for a short period of time if I upgrade the Power Up. Finally, I'd love to see a mode where you don't have to kill enemies at all, instead just allowing the player to enjoy some relaxing platforming.I have no doubt the developer cares about this game due to fixes that were made post release, and my hopes are that they continue to work on this and fine tune it so when players decide to get their endless runner fix, Alpacapaca Dash is on top of that list.I have more to say in the videos below, but is Alpacapaca Dash worth the .99 I paid for it: YES. While I don't believe it'll convert those on the fence when it comes to games of this genre, gamers who fancy a distraction that only these type of games can provide will find a lot to love about it. Besides, it's great to support a developer who continues to support their game and I'm all for encouraging that type of behavior.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDuSzkJixfAhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3uPre_Zi64"

It is not as good as Robot Unicorn Attack.I love the visual style, and the music's entertaining, and I like being able to unlock character skins.But playing it is so hard and unenjoyable for several reasons. You can't vary your jump height or speed which makes it hard to control.  What the hell do the powerups do? It's hard to tell, because you're too busy looking elsewhere and trying not to die. You have no melee attack option to help adapt your play style to different enemies. You only have a lazer beam, and I HATE that lazer beam. Let me tell you why.So you're moving forward at a nice speed, right, you got this. It's fast enough to be challenging, but then one of those stupid bats comes flying towards you, which means they're coming at you faster than the ledges and platforms. First you have to aim with your mouse, but don't take too long, because WHY THE HELL DOES THE LAZER NEED TIME TO CHARGE?! and then you're dead.Don't get me wrong, an alpaca weilding a lazer blast is super cute. But seriously, having to take the time to aim and wait for the lazer to charge kills me almost every time. I'm not even convinced that it works, because I've shot enemies twice before without them dying. It's very hard to tell what lazer strength will actually kill them. The aiming follows your mouse, so even though you CAN shoot your lazer midair, it's very hard to aim it. Why not have a weapon that fires quicker?Also the game crashes a lot.In summary, it's cute, but it's not fun. I'll keep playing it for the cute alpacas, but until they add features to make it easier to play, I'm not going to play it much. It's really not worth the ragequit."

,Recommended,579230,33951121,Posted: 1 August,all,Caffeinated Alpaca,"I drank 2 coffees whilst playing this game. The first one wasn't so nice because it tasted a bit like the apple juice i had drank in the same cup prior to the coffee. The second coffee was a lot better (either because the apple had washed way or because I had become used to it - I'm not sure) and it was upon finishing the second coffee that I realised that it was titled ""Alpacapaca Dash"" and not ""Alpaca Dash"". And this point I promptly quit the game. I really enjoyed this game though, and I come back to it if I have 10-15 mins to spare whilst waiting."

,Recommended,579230,29503458,Posted: 26 January,all,VidEvage,"I feel like two old memes gave birth to this game.Alpacas in hats. With Laser beams.It's a Speedrunner game made on Unity and considering the value, it's not a bad deal. Difficult enough to be frustrating, easy enough to beat previous runs.Also, did I mention Alpacas in hats? Swag.See if you can beat myRecord."

I haven't freed her yet but I sure have come close, and that's what drives me to continue playing this game. I wish op would make more games like this, it was so well done and amazingly fun."

I freaking love it cause the characters are so cute and the feeling you get when you finally get the hang of it. I actually would recommend this game due to its gameplay. And tbh, the price is good and the game is good so its worth it to buy."
,Recommended,579230,29522814,Posted: 27 January,all,Grima The Fell Dragon,"Want an endless runner that   has only two buttons, simple to learn, and hard to master? Then get this game. As you run and collect coins you can unlock different alpaca costumes ranging from a top hat to a sailor moon outfit, and buy upgrades that make it easier to get more money. The music is great and the visuals are way above most unity maker games.The only cons that I see are laser use, costume benefits, and enemy variety. The laser is slow to start up, which isn't a problem unless a bat comes racing at you or a blob is sitting on a platform you need to jump to. The costumes are cute, but give no benefits to laser power, jumping, or add a barrier, and that would be nice bonus added for unlocking them. And enemies need a little more variety either color swaps, the blobs need to move or not be hidden behind chests, and there needs to be a way to avoid power downs.Otherwise this is a fun little game to play, and try to get as far as you can."

,Not Recommended,579230,29794879,Posted: 8 February,all,AWDX,"The first 10 seconds are amazing. In fact so amazing that I just keep playing the first 2-10 seconds over and over again. Yea this is like flappy birds, the controls are really really hard for me to get the right timing. I've never gotten a score over 150 points. lol. I think this is even harder than flappy birds. At least in flappy birds, I could play for 30-60 seconds.Controller support would be very nice & helpful. But I think this is just a cheap little game. I love alpacas, lasers, and steam trading cards. So a buck is no big deal.But I do feel sort of scammed out of 99 cents. :p Well played, but to quote G.W. Bush - ""fool me once, shame on, shame on you. Fool me—you can't get fooled again.""Yea likely I won't be supporting this developer again. I would say only really buy it for the trading cards and maybe a few mins of cute frustration. :)Play time was idle to get trading cards. I've only played this maybe 5-10 mins.Uninstalling now. :/"
