Sure it maxed the card out (80-100% usage) but it never stuttered once.Some complain that this game is a seated VR experience with a controller. I actually like this. Don't get me wrong, touch and roomscale is amazing, but some times you just want to sit down and have a relaxing VR play session without having to walk around and wave your arms.The game looks stunning and runs great. As for the lenght, we will see.So far, I am happy that Crytek was able to resolve the issue."

Easily one of the greatest VR game out now.GRAPHICSThe graphics are 10/10, truly amazing lighting mixed with superb deatils. Sharp shadows, and SSAO. Looks gorgeous. Even in current gen VR resolution.SOUNDThe sound is phenomenal, just hearing dozen of nearby dinos, both in the air climbing the cave walls and roaring in the distance all adds to the imersion, not including the sweet music.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay, is quite imersive, I find myself getting lost in this foreign land of dinosaurs.There's so much to see, you just wander the land looking and observing all kinds of dinos and insects all scurrying along the ground, even moles that burry up from the ground. And you can sneak up on them and scan them all.Read about thme in the ""infotarium"" (sort of a in-game dino-pedia)There's so much I don't want to spoil for you, you need to go out there and discover this for yourself.It's basically a dinosaur exploration game. It's nice, quite and relaxing. Not to repetitve.You can give you pet t-rex(yes that's right, I said pet t-rex) orders and even tell it to roar, in result, scaring off unwated dinosaurs that wander to close.The oculus controls are are nice touch... see what I did there?;)NEGATIVE POINTI would love to see some more interactivity with the enviroment. Such as plants and stuff, or even use the grip controls to pick up objects, would be cool. Right now there's alot of object pass through. The last step right now is an eviroment I can touch.9/10An absolute MUST BUY. Especially for Dino nerds.Well worth the asking price, and more.For those still unsure, then wait. Check out my Let's play of this game, where I talk about all that's great in this game and just take it all in.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD7ZSk6JT3U&t=612s"

If you lke any of those you will like this game.I was skeptical about purchsing Robinson after the initial reviews, however I bought it anyway and I really enjoyed it.This is  more than a ""tech demo"" as some people have stated. There is a very clear objective and story to uncover as you progress though the game. I was a little worried about no touch support but the game is a gaze based game where you look at things to interact with them in some way, and it works really well.The designers have done some really intersting things in Robinson."

With all the low budget indie games that aren't so great, it is refreshing to see a polished title like this one. If this is the future of VR, I am all in. Great graphics, good story line, great voices, great performance (game optimization) make this worth every penny."

Hands position is wrong, when the game starts i had to change controllers right to left + left to right.2. The location of the hands is not quite accurate. I mean that when i see my hand i feel that the hand of the character is a bit higher than my real hand & shifted a little bit which force u to lose the immersive.3. The character is higher than my real hight, adding hight calibration is highly recommended.4. The movement system & rotation cause motion sickness, I would recommend to:A. Access to modify the movement speed.B. Allow the player to chose either walking or running.C. Direction of movement to be linked with the hands direction, not head direction (sometimes we head for a direction with moving our heads to explore surrounds.)D. To add teleportation because it is the best way to avoid motion sickness.E. When climbing cliffs, the whole character & camera angle changes according to the main facing side. Which means that i find my self inside the rocks & i had to move & rotate myself in real life to relocate my self.Note: I do have psvr but I didn't buy Robinson cuz i believe that vr games are more immersive & enjoyable when u r free to move & can use ur hands.So plz, either u modify the problems or refund us."

Had a few crashes playing with the settings especially aliasing but otherwise game looks great, as good as it gets so far. Reminds me of the Oculus official Farlands minigame but more story driven objectives."
,Recommended,579820,29934342,Posted: 14 February,all,TRS_Ashton,"Visually really cool. Love the environments and the dinos. High quality production. Good graphics and voice acting. The gameplay is decent adventure game type puzzle solving. I don't like the way they handle turning or movement acceleration, both of which make me a little nauseated and force me to play the game in 45 minute increments.Overall it's a pretty cool title. Hopefully this is the start of more high quality titles coming to VR."

76561198019046685,Recommended,579820,35247150,Posted: 27 September,all,Hooded Crow,"This is definitely one of the best games you can get for Vive right now.  The sense of scale and immersion you get from Cytek's beautiful CryEngine graphics is worth the price alone.  I have not played this with a regular gamepad and will be basing everything from here on around motion controllers.Crytek really upset me when they launched The Climb as an Oculus exclusive and still to this day have not given official OpenVR support for it.  This game pretty much makes up for that however by bringing those awesome climbing mechanics to a vast story driven world centered around discovery.  Gameplay pretty much consists of scanning the life forms that occupy the prehistoric planet you've landed on and discovering lore building upon the story of why you're there in the first place.  This game is actually the first to keep me interested enough in the story to actually want to find and read all the lore I can.  It's short, to the point and keeps you wanting to find out more.  There are also some puzzle elements but nothing over bearing or tedious. The climbing you'll be familiar with if you've ever played ""The Climb"" or ""Climbey"".  Definitely my favorite element of the game and keeps you're heart racing when you're hundreds of feet in the air with hungry predators below, waiting for you to slip up.  To increase the sense of immersion you also get a little T-rex pet that follows you around and will play hide and seek with you.  I would gladly have payed $60 for what I've experienced so far and still have more of the game to explore."

The jungle just feels alive and you are guided quite well by your friend, the flying robot, which explains the controls bit by bit when you need them and he is also very entertaining and tells you what to do next.CONTROLS:They are ok at best. Only the climbing part feels very nice. You dont actually use your hand in terms of grabbing stuff. You have your device in your hand which lets objects move. Thats absolutly ok, it's just different. I personally like it because you have longer range and you can easily pick up things on the floor.But there is not much interaction going on compared to other games. Worst part is that you sometimes have to press thumbpad up (on vive) instead of trigger for opening doors etc. which is very confusing at the start.The movement is different, too: You move in the direction you look (not where your controller is pointing like in Onward). It feels weird but i got used to it very quick.No true room scale: The game has one exact spot which is your standing point. If you move somewhere else in your playspace you must readjust the spot by holding your left menu button.Unnescery camera movents when you start to climb or jump on a rope.So to sum it up: The controls are different than expected but they are working. The game could be much better with very small changes so i hope there will be an update.PERFORMANCE:Perfect performance (R9 390) on high settings, Super Sampling 1.4. Some parts still look a bit blurry but nevertheless the graphics are gorgeous when you turn them up!All in all this is really one of the best VR experiences if not the best! It's like a perfect VR movie. The background story is not very interesting but behind every corner a surprise is waiting for you. And especially the jungle is absolutly amazing! Dozens of little scripted events and thousands of creatures everywhere. The background music is on point. I played robinson already 3 times and it wasn't the last time.10/10 minus 2 for weird controls"

All the experience is ruined... much much better with keyboard and a mouse."
76561197971200127,Not Recommended,579820,29956902,Posted: 15 February,all,Awesome!,"Visually this can be a stunning VR game with some great voice acting, but from the half hour that I played with the controller, It just feels too limiting -- in movement. Like If I was forced to hike through a jungle literally dragging my butt around the ground and cranning my head like an owl. This game seriously needs motion control support with roomscale. I'm finding that in any VR FPS game you definitely can't use a controller or it'll just feel clunky and awkward.It could also use some better textures in some areas, although the overall graphics are better than most VR titles out there. My early impressions of the gameplay is pretty boring tbh. Looking up other reviews from PSVR users seem to agree that this game is kinda meh.I plan to buy this when it drops below $20. Until then... Refund.Sorry Crytek."

,Not Recommended,579820,29913321,Posted: 13 February,all,Red,"I have to say, the games prosepect and having dinosaurs running about sounds awesome. However the reality of that for me is extreme nausea. I mean extreme. I have never felt this sick before playing a game, especially a vr title. I cant hack it.The developer did include some tools to help with overcoming nausea, but they were ineffective. For me its the movement below my horizon. All of that really makes me sick. Also, without touch included, there is no anchor into reality, which may play apart of it.For the brief hour that I was unable to endure through multiple sessions, that game seems relatively simple and just a good demo of what VR can be.I was able to play through The Gallery Episode 1: Call of the starseed without any problems. Some of the elevator stuff made me a little bit queasy, but it quickly subsided.Buy at your own peril."

I think stick-based locomotion could work well, but it certainly doesn't here. In its current form, this is a nausea inducing nighmare. Touch support might help, but who knows if that's even being worked on?"

I purchaced this as they say they now have touch controles for the vive and thats what ive been waiting for but alass these so called touch controles are non existent. you can barely use them to climb, catch bugs or just generally interact with anything, the game is broken and as i purchaced it for my 7 year old dinosaur mad son it would be impossible for him to use it.Shame Really because its a beautiful looking game and has great premise."
