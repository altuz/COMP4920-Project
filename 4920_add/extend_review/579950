Since I like the movie a lot, I had to get used to the different looks and voices of the main characters a little bit, at first. Also the relatively limited freedom of movement in this style of game felt restrictive.After I replayed the first episode on a different path and continued to the second episode I was hooked and the game became really immersive.The story feels authentic, fresh and original, with a sense of mystery, humor and adventure. I loved the ancient alien temples and locations, somehow they felt very real. I began to care about the characters. By the 2nd episode I really felt at home on this ship and enjoyed being with this colorful bunch of characters, learning more about their personal struggles and living the adventure.Can’t wait to play the next episode!Groot says: “I am GROOOOT!”http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=942315619"

My major complaints are that there is very little dialogue options. I felt like a was watching a movie with just a few dialogue options here and there. I felt that I didn't really have any control over the characters and the storyline. The game got so boring towards the end that I was only excited for it to be over. I really wanted to like this game, being that I am a GOTG fan but telltale just hasn't done it for me."
,Not Recommended,579950,31262776,Posted: 20 April,all,Harold,I don't quite know what to say. It seems as if there is less and less effort being put into these games as time goes on. It's heavily reliant on QTE more than real storytelling now. The episodes themselves are growing much shorter and for a first episode I found this truly weak. I'm not saying it was bad I just wouldn't reccomend it until the rest of the series is out.
,Recommended,579950,32225204,Posted: 6 June,all,[LPG] HueyHadAStroke,"Not for everyone, the ""action"" scenes are nothing more than glorified QTE's. This is above all a point and click adventure, and a good one, not the best of it's genre but not the worst either. Much like Tales from the Borderlands, you start to make meaningfull choices early on and your choices will affect the other characters, whic is made even harder if you have seen the movies or read the comics. I alos like the art style of this one, it's more like an animated film than a comic book, mixes it up abit. Still, I wish this were a short film or mini series rather than a game, as most TellTale games feel. Get this only if you are patient enough to put up with it, and dont go in expecting it to be a third movie because you'll be very disappointed. Oh, and TellTale, please get a new engine to run your games on, I am getting way to much stutter for my PC's specs."
,Recommended,579950,31673687,Posted: 10 May,all,Zer0sion,"This review will change over time.So far there have been a minimum of 7 choices that I made that had some minor impact to the story, I do not mind that it is not a huge impact because the game needs to follow a story, just like all choice-based games.(Life is Strange followed a story about friendship) (Late Shift followed a story about crime) and all the choices in those games were minor, just like in other Telltale games.The graphics have improved in this Telltale Game, and do not use the cell-shading technique the comic-based games had. If you look at the skin of a character, it looks really nice and modern. Though I don't honestly mind graphics and really liked the comic style the other ones had. Frame drops are not really an issue unless your specs are below the standards that Telltale set on the store page.The story is about you keeping 'The Guardians of The Galaxy' together. While this is an interesting goal, some of the choices seem to favour certain characters and Telltale seems to push you into choosing one option. I hope to see a scene in episode 5 where based on your choices certain members of the group leave. It would probably confirm that there would be no sequel, but most games are better off without sequels."

Great Soundtrack. Only downside is the long wait between episodes.Even for someone who is completely new to the Guardians universe the game sets up the characters and gives plenty of backstory while walking around on the ship that you'll be able to catch on to who everyone is and what's going on fairly quickly.

And just like the Batman game they are making it their own. Not as much as the Batman game but this is a uniquly telltale story set in the Marvel U. The setup for the next epsiodes seems decent enough to keep me going but the character dynamics are spot on. And the action sequences were well done, fluid and quick with the right ammount of tension.I can't wait for episode two, just wish the epsiodes were just a bit longer then the usal 60-90 min playtime."

Since Tangled up in Blue is one of my favorites I was biased, sort of.The gang’s back. Peter and Gamora, sexual tension you could cut with a knife. That Raccoon varmint, still building  over-sized rifles that he can’t get to work ‘til the absolute last second. Drax, big on brawn short on brain and the only one who refers to Peter as “Starlord”. And Groot? Yeah, He’s still Groot.It’s too early too tell if the story’s going to be any good. The same with the interactive component. Not enough to tell how decisions you make will change the direction the story takes. I liked the comic book posturing and dialogue but, as with the movie, it didn’t have me rolling on the floor.When you have control, searching is pretty lackluster. There are not many things you have to find. There wasn’t anything that you could miss that could give  you insight to people or events that might prove helpful later in the game. In the action sequences, you’re allowed a greater response time than I’ve seen in other TellTale games. Also, in some cases, the character you’re with will have your back and help you out should you not react in time. Me and my zombie fingers found that helpful but others with a quicker actions might find it takes out the challenge.While episode one left me wanting episode two, I’m not really waiting with bated breath."

Very good dialogue and choices too. Telltale did Guardians of the Galaxy right. :)Enjoyed the first episode every bit as much as the movie. Even though the characters look different, they sound close enough to their movie counterparts and the visual style is spot on."

I loved ""Wolf Among Us"" and ""Tales of the Borderlands"", even ""Game of Thrones"", but the last couple games I've played under their banner have had graphics issues, stupid and meaningless QTEs, uninspired voice acting and bad scripts.  It feels like the company hit its peak with the early releases and thinks it can just coast on that success.  This may well be the last TT game I purchase."

The story seems interesting, although as far as origins go, it is different than the Movie in a few ways, some good and others not so much.  The Music in the game is great, as is required for Guardians of the Galaxy, but the lack of songs was dissapointing, even though the ones that were there were nice.  It is by far tTelltale's best as far as cinematic camera use and smooth transitions go, but that isn't saying a ton for them.  Animations were smooth and satisfying.  My main complaints would have to be the voice acting for Star Lord, normally even with a mediocre cast, the lead is well done, but in this case the cast is strong accept for his overly campy and emphisized speech paterns.The dialogue itself is good and feels like things Starlord would say, the voice acting is just weird, I understand campy is the vibe of GotG in many ways, but even for it there was just to much emphasis on words in a weird way.  And again while it has to look different from actual actors, I did feel the characters looked too different in some ways, and changing the 'Awesome Mix' to the 'Rad Mix' was just weird... Then again so is the fact that I care about that.  All in all, not Telltale's best or worse, choices could have felt like they mattered more, but the only Telltale game to ever do that and have it feel 100% genuine is Tales from the Borderlands, and while I would love more of that quality, Telltale has a ton on their plate right now.  They may have bit off mo\re than they could chew on that one (Play the game and you'll get the referance I just made).Telltale also tried testing the water with what I can only describe as 'Combat Sequences' that while interesting, fell flat due to the low stakes of these weird non-quick-time events.  I love the idea of Telltale adding actual gameplay to their games more than just dialogue options and quick time events, and I can see them adding full on third person combat to games in the future if the half baked version of the idea in this episode is well received.  As a shooter fan I would love this mixed with the game, but that isn't what Telltale has made it's name in, and some people would lose intrest because of that.  I think there is room for improvment on the 'Combat' if you can call it that, but it seems interesting, and the whole game as of now is promising.  I also appreciated that they put a large amount of play time and content into the first episode, unlike the painfully short Episode 1 of TWD Season 2.  The play time is about 110 minutes, or it was for me anyways.I enjoyed this both as a Telltale fan, and a Guardians of the Galaxy fan, and I'm excited to see more.  It's definetley worth the 25 Dollars, that said there are still other games I would recommend first.  So basically... Good not Amazing.7.5 / 10  (If you wanted a solid number then I would go up to 8)"

I love Telltale, and this might be, in my opinion, the second best Telltale game I have played, only bested by The Wolf Among Us, and I can see this from only the first episode. I'm really excited to see where they are going to take this story, because the first episode sets up a very interesting story combined with some of the best gameplay mechanics in a Telltale game. And even though this isn't a deciding factor at all, the graphics are absolutely beautiful, the best graphics in a Telltale game? I believe so."

,Recommended,579950,34435791,Posted: 23 August,all,[GAZArts],"Just finished the third episode in the series and i'm enjoying this incarnation of the guardians. One of the things telltale has always done best is story telling. So the fact that gamer input seems to be slowly eroding away from these games doesn't really bother me as much as other players. It would be nice if my choices felt like they carried some weight however. There was a moment in one of the episodes where the player has an option to let an opponent win in a fight or not. I selected not to let them win and after the choice played out the opponent swiped my character's legs during a cinematic. So it would seem you can take different routes but they ultimately all end up back to the main intended story line. So yeah, the game IS NOT tailored to how i play. It actually fights me every step of the way. Regardless of this there is enough here to keep you entertained. Good work."

The game in its entirety is actually better than I thought it would be from the very first trailer I saw of it. I don't usually care for graphics but the graphics are actually pretty decent and as expected for a Telltale game, they went for a ""comic look"" and nailed it. Also great song choices! I had a lot of fun jamming out to some good ol' classics.In terms of the characters so far and I'll be honest, as far as the characters go, the least interesting character is actually the Starlord himself since his dialogue seems a bit poor but I digress, it's only the first episode and I have confidence that there will be improvements. It's still a great game in itself regardless.Overall, the story is pretty solid and the other characters are likeable. What can I say? It’s an enjoyable episode. I really have no complaints.

As soon as the game play started I was hooked. I hadn't bought much in the way of computer games until recently so I wasn't sure what to expect. The dialogue is fantastic and the range of choices; while limited, after two play throughs with different decisions, offer a wide variety of scenes to uncover. I had so much fun playing it that during the cinematics, I almost forgot I was playing a game until the detector told me to hit E or Up or something.The only *real* drawback I'd seen was of the face modelling, particularly on Starlord and Garona. They felt like I was playing with claymation dolls and the expressions didn't match the emotions at all times. Barring that, the feeling of nostalgia in the music, the banter and oftentimes sappy nature of the dialogue between the characters felt genuine and got me smiling a few times.

As it goes on though, the pace picks up more, especially with the fights. I love the elements you can do, from the communication, to the rocket boosts, and so forth. Reminds me of the good stuff in Tales from the Borderlands.Soundtrack is primo, but the graphics are rather lacking, I feel. It seems like the more games they make, the worse it gets, but oh well. It's how they roll, I suppose. Story isn't great, but it's good enough to keep a ball of plot rolling. I hope that there's some real twists as it goes on. I'm also hoping that your choices help to tailor the plot more, because for the first episode, it didn't really seem to have much of an impact, but who knows, maybe it will in later ones.All of the information seems to be true to heat to both movie and comics, save for that there's a few tweaks here and there(especially for the backstory of Peter Quill, at least in the movie)Overall, I'd give it a 7/10.

,Recommended,579950,34657500,Posted: 1 September,all,Ty-Dragonmist,"There's a few big Pros and Cons here, the Pro is that its a fun game with a pretty great sense of humor. They stay true to the personality of the characters. Con is that its feels, looks, and plays a bit like TellTale's other game Jurassic Park. Which if anyone is an avid player of TellTale games they know Jurassic Park wasn't so grand....Let's be honest that game sucked, but I have some hopes for Guardians of the Galaxy, the story starts out like you would expect, based off what you might've seen in the movies and/or read in the comics. So Quill and the Gang will have a bunch of misadventures along the way. You play as each character in each episode paving their own side missions and shaping the story. Most chocies don't seem to make a difference either way, and the action starts out pretty slow.But I would still recommend this game especially if you're heavily into choice based games, unique art style and story telling. Or of course if you're fan of either TellTale or Gaurdians of the Galaxy. I would suggest to buy this game when its on sale though, the asking price now isn't worth that much.Pros: Likeable characters, easy to follow story arc, funny dialoge, choice based.Cons: Feels like Jurassic Park, too many buttons to use in one setting, must pay close attention to QTE's"

It's funny, with some great characterisation and it's generally just very fun to play.If you haven't seen the films (it seems more based on the film characters) then you probably won't have the necessary knowledge to understand the characters right from the start, but there's plenty of character development to either catch up or to get to know these characters better. All in all, an enjoyable game which follows the Telltale formula with new additions from Batman and A New Frontier, but doesn't really add anything new to the table."

The one saving grace is the Thanos fight at the beginning but after that everything feels slow unresponsive and with very little chance of any form of hurt. At times it's unclear whether it is following the comics lore or the movies. The diolgue between the characters everyone knows and loves in the movie has gone out the window, as most of it has been replaced with expotition and dull backstory nobody really wanted. Was hoping it would at least come to par with batman, where they changed a lot of major story lines and plot points to make the story exciting but guardains just isn't as recgonisable with only two movies and a few comics from the 80's... Just a great big cash grab with very little humour or entertainment."

It is absolutely riddled with bugs, and framerate issues, along with buggy controls.Honestly, I was really enjoying myself when I went through the first time. Everything seemed to be going my way. Got to near the end of the episode and decided to call it a night. But only there's no way to manually save. Fine, I can accept the auto save/ cloud save thing. That's cool with me. HAHA JOKES ON ME. When I booted it up the next day, it said there was a discrepancy between my cloud save files and local files. I had no way of knowing which was the right one, OR where either was at. Seemed logical that the local saves would be right, since that doesn't require a connection to exist. I'm not sure if that was the right choice or not. As soon as I chose, the game overwrote my cloud files with local ones (I had no say otherwise). Seemed fine, I guess, but when I went to continue my file (it did say continue) the game crashed. UH OH. Booted it up, and the saves were all gone. The game ALSO doesn't let you download files from the cloud. Funny right? It has ""cloud saving"" but the player has no way to access the cloud to get said saves.So now I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but I figure for the future I'll just play a bit at a time and HOPE it doesn't happen again. Well ♥♥♥♥ me sideways, I get through about a half an hour and the game crashes again and wipes my saves. I promise you it's not my computer. Every game in my library (many of which are more taxing than this) I can play at 1080p/1440p @ 60fps. I have a machine. ♥♥♥♥in' livid, but hey, I love these telltale games, so I try again. NOPE ♥♥♥♥ ME. Happens again.Now, I'd love to say maybe you'll get lucky and the saves won't just ♥♥♥♥ themselves from time to time for you. So, let's just assume that's true (lol). Game runs like garbage. No matter what I have the settings at there are framerate issues at work here. Gamora occasionally has some strange white artifact that appears in her hair from time to time. There are lots of technical issues with the game. It also looks like♥♥♥♥♥ Animations are really horrible and janky, even by telltale standards. There are scenes where the developers must have forgot where a character was, or what direction the were going in, because the cut away changes it completely.The only thing good I have to say is that it's kind of funny, but jesus ♥♥♥♥ there are way too many issues.

It's not the best one, but certainly not the worst.So i'll keep my review short:Pros:-Good writing. It's got that Guardians Of The Galaxy feel with some good wit, timing and humor.-Interface update. There's more things to do with your character (ex. call a member via shift key) and it's seems a little different and updated.-Great music. Again, in line with GOTG in real life, it has a great soundtrack that rivals Tales From The BorderlandsCons:- Lip sync. It could still improve on lip facial animations when talking.- Decisions. Sadly, sometimes it feels that my decisions in TT games are getting less and less important to the outcome.- Thanos. As a Marvel/DC fan, and if you are one too, having Thanos for me is a negative because he is arguably the MOST powerful thing and using him as the villain felt wrong. Look at the movies, it's going to take almost every hero to bring him down and in this it felt as though he wasn't as strong and wise as he should be.So, overall it's a solid and well made TT game and if you enjoy their others and/or you like Guardians Of The Galaxy, you're not going to hate this game, however you might not completly love it either."

For example, Star-Lord seems to have some lines and deliveries that more closely resemble that original comic book character than Chris Pratt's 'regular Joe in space' interpretation (which is also great, mind you, just different). There are also numerous references to the Universal Church of Truth, the main villains of that series, which makes me cautiously optimistic that they will be like Chekov's Gun and show up later!Also, like that older Guardians story, it begins withkilling Thanos.Which is another reason that, again, I expect some glorious UCT shenanigans.I BELIEVE!"

,Recommended,579950,31226039,Posted: 18 April,all,Rose,"This feels like a mixed bag to me. There's positives but there's also negatives too. From what I can muster, this feels like the one Telltale game that has the least gameplay in it. The battle sequence with Thanos in the beginning was probably the highlight for me, as I thought it was a nice combination of QTE's as a whole team rather than just playing as Star Lord alone.  The humour is pretty good, not the best - but I think there's some good writing overall for a first episode. It leaves a good impression, and I find there's some potential here.However, comparing it to past TT games - there's more narrative here for sure which in turn takes out more gameplay. I don't know if it'll be the same for each episode in this series, but I'm hoping they find a much better balance between them - because this episode is 80% dialogue.It's fair to say that the reason behind this is because they're setting up the characters, so be it that it's dialogue heavy is a fair excuse in that regard. I'm just hoping it won't be the same for each episode, and that later on there will be more gameplay elements.I think this definitely has promise, but at the moment - if you're looking for gameplay heavy I'd give this a miss until the next episode is out."

But if you're only buying it from being GOTG fan, then I'd suggest looking up how they are played before buying it as it's not everyone's cup of tea.

(and okay, on a more selfish note, thanks for sliding in and ruining my ship, telltale. can't the cute star-dork and his raccoon boyfriend be left in peace? jeez.)  i didn't enjoy any of this, but the soundtrack was still pretty kickin'. here's hoping episode 3 isn't half as bad and at least some of the crew try to stop being such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. 4/10.do i currently recommend this game? after episode 2, god no.can this be changed? it'll be difficult, but yeah. get some new writers. these ones suck."

Make a well in the centre. Add eggs. Gently whisk with a fork, using your other hand to secure the walls. Draw in the flour as you go.Step 2Bring the dough together. Knead for 5 minutes or until elastic and smooth. Sprinkle the dough with flour, wrap in plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes to rest.Step 3Divide the dough into 4 portions. Flatten 1 portion slightly. Set the pasta machine on the widest setting and flour the machine and dough well. Feed through the machine.Step 4Repeat 6 more times, folding the dough into thirds and turning it 90 degrees until it’s smooth and the same width as the machine (at least 12cm). Halve crossways. Continue to feed each dough half through the machine, separately, without folding, narrowing the machine settings 1 notch at a time, until you reach the second last setting. The pasta should be about 1mm-thick. Repeat with the remaining 3 dough portions to make another 6 sheets.Step 5Place one prepared pasta sheet on a well-floured work surface. Place heaped teaspoons of filling (see related recipes) at 5cm intervals, in 2 rows, on the sheet leaving a 2cm border around edges.Step 6Brush around the filling with water – this helps keep the ravioli sealed. Top with a second pasta sheet and press firmly around the filling to seal and remove air pockets.Step 7Cut between the filling to make 5cm-square ravioli. Transfer the ravioli to a tray lined with floured non-stick baking paper. Continue with the remaining pasta and filling.Step 8Cook half the ravioli in a large saucepan of salted boiling water for 3-4 minutes or until al dente. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining ravioli. Pour over warm sauce (see related recipes)."

It's twists and turns are well rounded and some of the decisions made in the first episode makes me curious enough to know what the alternative might have been as well as how the next episodes will be affected.As a Telltale game it feels a lot like Batman with some elements of Back to the Future. I especially loved the part where you tested out Star Lord's equipment and could fly around the level. I really hope the next few episodes are released soon and I don't think Telltale have sold out at all. I think we all would like to see a baby Groot perhaps. Just because of the upcoming cinematic release.Some of the characters did not feel entirely realistic at certain points. Drax looked like the Disney Infinity version of himself sometimes. Although, I must admit at times the style and visualisation looked really good. Near the end of the episode I did experience some buffering, which I hope was just part of the release date hype.Check out the full episode here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK_gIzpTwMA"

It is your typcial TellTale Game, so if you're a fan of other games by this company like Tales from the Borderlands, Wolf among Us and Batman, chances are you're going to enjoy this one as well. For this game they've upgraded the graphic quite a bit. I'd say it is the best looking TellTale game to date. The animations are smoother, which can especially be seen during the action sequences. They feel a lot more dynamic and are very similar to the action sequences of the TellTale Batman game. But a lot of people play TellTale not because of action gameplay but because of the writing and the story. In this regard Guardians of the Galaxy is solid, not as good as Tales from the Borderlands (which is still my favorite) but good enough that you will have some laughs at the jokes and puns the characters make. The Story was interesting enough so it will keep me invested, yet the cliffhanger wasn't as satisfying as I had hoped.As with any game there are also a few cons:The first episode is SHORT! It clocks in at about 100 mins, which for the first chapter is too short in my Opinion. The Batman game had the same problem and I find it kind of weird that such talented writers are not able to make the first chapter longer. Earlier titles were 2h or even a little longer (per episode).One other thing I found odd, or rather useless was the time scanner. It only came into play once, at the beginning of the game. After that it was rather useless. In Tales from the Borderlands this mechanic was implemented much better with Rhys' robotic eye.Other than that it looks like Guardians of the Galaxy is going to be a solid and fun TellTale game, which any fan of the series will enjoy. If you're new to this type of game I would recommend trying out one of the older titles, like The Walking Dead or Tales from the Borderlands."

,Recommended,579950,34128834,Posted: 9 August,all,Pawnda,"I am Groot? I am Groot!\\\\////EDIT review (Potential spoiler? Hmm, maybe?)Episode 1: For me this game well-opened with an comedic scene from Star-Lord (as you know it), you go on a mission to defeat Thanos before he gets what he seek. This episode generalize about what Guardian of Galaxy encounters but not all of it, because you will get cliffhanger scene at the end. The first episode is not much, just a short 2 hours or less depends on how you play it (for me its one hour and couple of minutes)Episode 2: This episode is more driven to two characters: Peter Quill and Rocket, so you will know what happens with Rocket about his past and why did he insist Peter about the Eternity Forge (after what happens to Peter). I like how the story behind it that make Rocket acts like that. And of course, this episode ends with cliffhanger scene and lasts longer than episode 1.Episode 3: In this episode, the character development is change from Rocket to Gamora--and her sister (maybe Telltale wants to fill in the story with each of Guardian members? I dunno). You open this episode where Peter and Gamora finds something and someone! So the journey goes on. What I like about this episode is unexpected answer and humor I can choose. At the end you will find yourselves in ♥♥♥♥ed up situation with the main protagonist. One thing I didn't find complete is that the durations of this episode seems a little bit short?"

When playing TWDS3 you never know when someone is going to die and it creates this sort of tension.  In this I am ver disconnected from the story I found myself struggling to finish the episode because it was just so boring.  Also the voice actor for Star Lord is the same for Lucas from Minecraft Story Mode amd now he's like type casted for me.

There's a way to hack the game with cheat engine to temporarily change the aspect ratio to 21:9. It has to be reset occasionally by hitting Alt-Enter twice.I supposed you could remap the keys on your keyboard if you are left handed and have a gaming keyboard capable of that.In other words: it's a typical shoddy console port.But, if you have a 21:9 monitor AND are left handed AND don't have time to fix the programmer's carelessness, don't buy it.If you are right handed and play on a 1920x1080 monitor, go for it.

76561197987199121,Recommended,579950,31280239,Posted: 21 April,all,Trityler,"**UPDATED REVIEW FOR EP2**To summarize my original review below, I felt EP1 gave too much attention to setting up the story and not enough of it to fleshing out its characters and dialogue, but remained hopeful that the up-front investment in setting the stage would pay off in later episodes. After getting through Episode 2, I am much more confident this will be the case.While there was also plenty to suggest it in EP1 as well, EP2 makes it pretty clear that loss and how we come to accept it are going to be a big theme in this story. Much like how EP1 spent time on Peter's memories of his mom, EP2 does the same for some one that Rocket has lost and I would not be surprised to see future episodes follow this pattern for the remaining Guardians. While still not quite what I have come to expect from the movies and Tellatale's best, EP2 nevertheless revived my interest. Hopefully, everything will continue to build momentum in the remaining episodes.**ORIGINAL REVIEW OF EP1**Unfortunately, it was hard to come away from EP1 without having an overwhelming feeling of ""Meh.""Neglecting character chemistry and failing to flesh-out dialogue for an entire episode, just to move the story forward, is not unusual for Telltale. What *is* unusual for them is that they seem to have decided to let the first episode serve as their ""sacrifical"" one this time around, as opposed to the traditional third or fourth episode.Since the first episodes of Telltale series usualy wind up becoming demos for hooking viewers, I'm kind of surprised they were willing to sign-off on such a weak start for a new series. Hopefully, their rationale here was to rely on the popularity of the film to attract viewers and go ahead and get the necessary foundation-building for the story out of the way...Ending on a positive note: Peter's dead Mom still has great taste in old music."

,Recommended,579950,31235468,Posted: 19 April,all,[iH] Professor JRC,"Updated for Episode 2 11/06/2017 and reccomendation reversed.Episode 1: So far, so predictableGoing into this, I suppose I must say I'm both a Telltale fan, and a Marvel one, so I guess I had high expectations going in. So far, to be honest not yet mindblowing. The plot is kinda basic and the sort of thing seen a lot of times (and I can already see where certain resolutions will be coming in later on) and uses a few clichesWhat is it with people and leaving world changing artefacts in abandoned ruins/temples/dungeons?. It's also a bit slow moving and rail-roaded - not too many options in dialogue, and what choices there are have little impact in this episode aside from one major one. Additionally, there's little explanation for various things - it does assume you at least know the basics of Guardians of the Galaxy, and are expected to have at least seen the film, but then some of the comparisons made to that source material are not favourable, and it can't seem to decide from which mythos it's picking and choosing.In summary, it all feels like setup, which I guess makes sense given it's episode one of five, but it's just not as enjoyable as it should be (and as good as other TT game beginnings) and falls a little flat because of this. I'm left on the level, a bit detached from the game and the characters, and not heavily anticipating the next installment and the resolution of a cliffhanger like I have in past. It's all about setting up the chessboard, and not about playing, and that doesn't make for as enjoyable an experience.So, as of episode one, I can't reccomend this as there's just not enough to get your teeth into at this stage. Maybe (hopefully) that'll change in the future, but for now... wait to see how the rest of this turns out quality wise before going for this one.Episode 2: Now that's more like itNow this is what a Telltale game should be; diverging paths with bigger decisions, character development, proper story development, and  real choices I'm actually agonising over and re-thinking right now.There's not much more I can say without spoilers (which is a good thing!)Of course, there are a few problems; mouth animation is a bit off, there's a bit of flip-flopping character decisionRocket is constantly changing mood, and switches opinion on the artifact in the space of a minute's screen timeand there's a bit of lacking expositione.g. Quill makes reference to Rocket damaging the Revenant, something we never see on screen (or at least, not with my path choices), and in the same sequence it isn't explained how Kree were onboard or why they waited until they were in space or anything, it just felt like it was put there because a fight scene was needed. Also, admittedly it's quite frustrating with some of the decisions when there's only bad/stupid ones available.But, in the overall, I can now switch the polarity of my review to reccomend. If you like the Telltale format, and don't mind the problems above (the fact it's imitating the films, while at the same time trying to distance itself from them makes things a little confusing and even cringy at times, and sometimes you only have bad decisions which leave you screaming at the screen for a sensible one, etc.) So, would now reccomend."

Yeah your choices might not matter sometimes or most of the time ,but just being able to pick what to say is the best part. I recommend this game and all telltale games first one I played I watched all the others!10/10 Would Listen to Rad Music Again!"
,Recommended,579950,32244548,Posted: 7 June,all,Mr. Riddlemethis,"One word: mind-blowing. This is what GOTG 2 should have been (I liked that movie though. Sorry, guys. I just think it wasn't as good as the first movie). Fun, heart-warming, thrilling story of a true friendship with sacrifices. A little bit less colorful than other Marvel stories (which is, in my opinion, is a plus), this one has that unique atmosphere that, I think, was in the first movie. The characters don't just do CHEESY HEROIC THINGS FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY. They just do what they think is right while keeping their charming personalities. I really appreaciate that. They even have old brutal Drax! He's a true badass again! But also he has feelings. And he cares about Quill. That fusion of traits make him one of the most interesting and well'done characters of the game (also that Nova mook was really hilarious. Like him too). Unlike GOTG 2 Drax which felt like he was... dumbed down. Kinda like Drax for kids. But they've raised the vulgarity level up. That's a balance, heheh!Well, as you can read from my hallucinations written above, it's an INTERACTIVE MOVIE. LITERALLY. It's... not really a game. In fact, there is almost no true gameplay in a traditional way. It feels more like that ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" gamebooks or text adventure games. It's not a bad thing. Sure, there's almost no puzzles or hardcore action but that's what makes Quantic Dream's and Telltale's games so unique. The most important part of this game is dialog. And it's really good. You really get involved into a story, you really start to care about the team. And every time Telltale manages to surprise the player. I can't spoil (the game itself is a big pile of spoilers, heheh) but... Okay I will THANOS IS-- ahhhhh... That's... not a good idea.All-in-all, you should definetely buy this game whether your a hardcore gamer (yes, fighting game fans count too), a comic book fan, a GOTG fan, a GOTG movie fan, a Telltale fan, a LucasArts Games fan, an interactive movie fan or just a guy who's passing through. Now I must end with a punchline... Khe-khem... IT'S PAYBACK TIME! Oops! Wrong line! Khem... Ah, that's it! Telltale strikes again."

,Recommended,579950,34886230,Posted: 11 September,all,CPT-PRIME,"The first episode was not quite on par with what I expected after Telltale's glorious Tales from the Borderlands, but in terms of hilariously entertaining dialogue this comes close to Deadpool (which is pretty hard to top). Oh and it's got great music. If you're into that."
