He's only asking for 10 dollars and thats already a steal for the amout of content you get and with the game updating id recommend it heavily. So i really hope he continues to update the game and keep the amazing content coming. Great job keep it up!

,Recommended,580040,30134518,Posted: 23 February,all,BoomBox,"Overall it's a great game with plenty of potential. There are things that need to be fixed/changed, but all games have some sort of bugs, glitchs or quirks to them. A thing I think should be added is more control over units, ie. you can give your units orders to attack on sight, find/call more friendlys if enemy's are seen, stand their ground no matter what etc. Also about the problem with red dominating on the desert arena, what I did was take out red ASAP. I took out their net and captured their tower within the first 10 minutes of starting. At first I was like ""nice, now red's gone, I'll naturally dominate the field"". However instead of that yellow took out blue, took control of the field and then sent 6 waves at me. Their 7th wave got me. As already stated, this is a great game and I'm looking forward to seeing it grow. It definatly gets my approval for Best New Game."

,Recommended,580040,30150360,Posted: 24 February,all,Nuhallis,"Pretty fun thus far, clearly very early but a lot of promise. The AI is not the smartest and often times during the attack on enemy bases a few units decide they want no part and run all the way back to base, they dont seem to want to follow commands from  time to time and the pathfinding can be a bit derp. But I consider those minor things. The first round I played was pretty fun and I can really see this going places, maybe some siege weapons, higher unit caps, improvments to the AI I think are really needed. Would recommend to pass a few hours. But dont expect perfection, it is early access.P.S. Archers ftw, even if they have stormtrooper aim 99% of the time."

,Recommended,580040,34639365,Posted: 31 August,all,☭AntiSocialEd™,"Overview-Formata is a Stratagy, acient war themed game. Formata allows the player to take charge of a unit and lead a small army into battle, to fight over objectives to gain money that you can purchase different units such asArchers, Engineers, Infantry and CommandersThe game caters for all sorts off different players, thedefencive, offencive and the down right brutalThe stratergy aspect comes in with the form of different map choke points to position archers and infantry in shield formations and unit positioning. Tactics are pivital to the game, and the ability to over see the battlefield from a birds eye view, a unit selection view, and a first person view.The game also has an indepth unit leveling system, different units do different things while in formation together, for example the commanders ability to improve squad health and damage. There is also a large unit upgrade system, that includes different tech trees for defence and offence, and a system that gives units more expirience for each battle they fight in, a nice detail.The game allows you to play as different factions from the ancient world, for exampleRomans, Greeks, Egyptians and BarbariansThis also includes multiplayer, however as it is such an unknown game, finding a match to play in is uncommon.ProsFirst person fightingStrategyDifferent ViewsCo-op fightsLarge number of Different FactionsIndepth leveling and upgrading systemConsOnly 4 types of unitsArchers, when used in field battles will ruin immersion, by running away when infantry charges them-ConclusionIn conclusion i would recommend that you try out this game, if it is your style of game, it has alot to offer that not many other games have, such as the interaction with the player while in battle, by giving him/her alot to do in that they must tell the squad they command to defend or attack enemy positions.Personally i really enjoy this game, as it offers quite alot. Its a great game to play if you're the kind of person who likes tactical warfare!"

I enjoyed the game. Another thing I would really like if the game was a little more pc friendly in terms that, well my laptop doesnt run it very well I have to set it on Low graphics and my laptop its pretty cool to play games, not super beefy games but still, my fps on most levels varies around 12-24 fps, sometimes when theres a bunch of units it drops to 5 or 8, so just that.

,Recommended,580040,30500372,Posted: 13 March,all,Rymbr,"As someone too dumb to play Total War, this game is easy enough to understand but not overly-simplistic either. It possibly could be that ""next big thing"" but right now there are just way too many annoyances that get in the way of having a fun time. Here are some major ones:The AI is as dumb as bricks. Take way too long to get from point A to point B without leading them yourself. (sometimes never even get there) There should be a command to send a squad of soldiers to a capture point, ignoring all enemies along the way. I lost a game because my army of 20 were too busy hunting down a stray engineer while the enemy was destroying our life-source thingy. Also engineers and archers run around like headless chickens when in danger and are impossible to hit because they're so damn fast.Arrows in this game just look stupid. They don't even look like they're travelling fast enough to actually hurt anyone. Also their range is terrible, and it's almost impossible to hit a moving target unless you're an AI.Suprised that you can't already do this, but you can't even seperate units or mix to kinds of units. Or command archers and melee units at the same time. It would be very helpful to be able to do so.The enemy can just send one unit to capture a point, and it's super annoying because if you already have a big army you'd have to send the whole thing to just kill that one guy and capture the point back. There should be a required amount of units to be able to capture a point, like 3 or 4."

I would like to see more units in the future like spearman or javilen men.The last complaint is that the game seems to be taxing on my computer, I can play mount and blade with 150+ men on the field and run 50-60 Fps but when I have 30 men in this game it really starts to lag, I wish it could be optimized better.Overall great game but I am concerned and hope that the devs continue to add new features and fix bugs. If they really keep updating and adding things it could be worth more than $10"

,Not Recommended,580040,31701454,Posted: 12 May,all,[REDi]1R CAPT Owlcoholic [A D],"I may have only played 1.9 hours at this point in time, but to be honest I've done everything you can do in this game and even spent a bunch of time just mucking around or trying to break things through boredom.The concept of the game is pretty solid and does feel somewhat rewarding. Basically you start with a base and build up some troops as well as buy upgrades. It's a simple capture and hold system to get the one resource in the game so most fights that take place are over these areas. You can destroy a team by attacking their base and breaking their... glowing... thing. The AI is actually somewhat decent in that they actively seek out objectives and try to destroy other teams pretty well.The main gripe is the content. I know it's early access but barely anything at all has been added or changed since release. The maps are pretty much the same thing with a different number of teams present. The upgrade system is good, but there's not enough. Usually you will have every upgrade within about 10 - 15 minutes of playing a match. Due to the low cost of troops and the low max population, pretty much all teams will always have the same amount of units, making the only good tactic to wait for 2 teams to duke it out, then quickly charge in while they are weakened and before they can spawn them all back in.In terms of graphics, it does have some visual appeal, though the standard Unreal Engine 4 mannequin is the model used for all factions, with the only variation being the helmet and the colour. I find this to be extremely unprofessional. I understand, again, that it's early access but I've never seen a game charge people when they are still using the built in prototype as the main model you see and interact with... The scary thing is, from their posts they don't directly say if the models will be changed at all in the future... Some people on the forums even say to keep them since they make the game 'unique' (a little obsurd when every single UE4 game starts with these models) or that people are sick of 'humans', which again is a little weird considering the maps are based off historical battles.I really don't know what else to say. I wish these guys/gals the best and I really hope they get more content done soon as well as replace the default model. If they put that little extra effort in, I can see this game being a minor hit. For now I can't recommend it, as the devs barely post on the forums and when they do they come across a little rude (though that may just be the language barrier) as well as never revealing anything about projected roadmaps/ release dates/ what they are even working on. For all we know they have already withdrawn all the funds they recieved and are living on a tropical island somewhere. Lets hope not."

Other then that it's a fun strategy game where you can form your units up and knock your enemy down with clever tactics. It really needs to under-go some development first. A workshop would help the game greatly.
,Recommended,580040,30348020,Posted: 5 March,all,DmL_1uk3,"would I recommend this game? well that depends, to someone who is new to these types of games, no. If you have exprience, then based on my expirence, that depends.I have played for a few hours and this is my first look at the game. So here are so somethings that I would like to talk about as of 3/5/2017. (some of these are false, so read all the way through)if your looking for a game with good graphics, this is the wrong game for you. the graphics, as of now, aren't good. wether that changes, only the devs know. Another thing I want to talk about is that there is NO tutorial, new people to this genre, beware. the game expects you to know what to do.While playing, the AI didn't seem so want to go where I was telling them where to go, as well as either some AI moving to the point or some AI not moving to where I was trying to move them, so I didn't know who I was moving where.I also jumped in, not knowing the pros and cons of the four types of soldier.So those are some of the topics I wanted to talk about, and I would love to see the devs tackle these issues!  But  as of know I would not reccomend this, just because its not beginner friendly and I think there are some issues in the game, but hopefully my opinion will change!I would like to abjure, as it turns out, a lot of things I said was false; I would like to start with the graphics, as they did seem to get better when controlling a soldier, which I didn't know you could do. and another thing is that there is a menu that tells you controls (in game, not on the start menu). This is, although not completely beginer friendly, its not going to hurt your expirence if you are a beginer. I am sorry for anything I said that turned out to be false, have a nice day!"

No number value yet though.The concept and idea behind this game are outstanding. I love being able to lead my troops into battle and to have ancient themed robots duking it out is just great. I WOULD have appriciated somekind of instruction on how to play, not saying its difficult to learn but it kinda just drops you in. All in all i find it an idea worthy of its price and one that i hope becomes the 10/10 game that i know it can.As with all alpha games, it has its fair share of issues. Ones that i hope the devs are serious in fixing because they can be game breaking at times.- Troops will randomly run back to your base or just refuse to move from the spawn at all.- Sometimes you'll take damage from a swing that did'nt come close to hitting you.For improvements, there is a lot of suggestions I can make but ill keep it to the best ones me and my friends would like to see.#1 - Multiplayer! Oh the joy i would have as ruining my friendships with buttloads or archers or dropping a stone on them for daring to assault my gates.#2 - More unit tactics. It would be awesome to see some way to lead your infantry and your archers in an assault while playing as one of your men.#3 - More unit types. I know it will be hard to implement but i cant help but feel like there should be more unit types. I'd love some cavelry and it would be fantastic to have either a medic/doctor that can bring back your little battle bots. As a side note I think commander units would be a great add.#4 - Bigger limits on units. Again, I know it might be hard to implement but the battles feel to small for such a grand idea and I think bigger armies would add an element of gravity to the sight of your enemies marching on you.Well, Depending on how the devs treat this precious golden child, I might just end up losing months of my life to it once it reaches adulthood. Only time (and the devs) will tell."

[i.e edit the nodes worth in terms of battle points]I know this is possible, but im guessing it will take some time and determination from the Devs.Overall as a conclusion, The game is good, and has potential to be great.. for what is it, in relation to its price.Id say it would be worth 9.99 if It had 5 or so more maps in its current state.But allowing the player some portion of editing settings would be nice + Creating our own battles down the line would be amazing and could actually evolve into the biggest selling point for the game."

This is a unique genre and as others have said, has so much potential to becoming something great! I've been wanting a game like this since I've been playing Age of Empires! I always thought Age would be so much more fun if it was possible to play the game, but then take control of a single unit in battle. Games these days want you to be the hero. I want to be the foot soldier, damnit! You can control what units to produce and the army of it, you can then play one of those units and they'll likely follow you around, and then you can even go into first person mode! It's awesome!In that, there is a quite a bit to manage. You gain resources which can either be used for research or to make more troops. There are trade offs with each one and that alone makes this game challenging.The downsides to its current state (V.0.9.3) is there isn't insight into what's driving your resource gain. It makes planning ahead very hard, if not impossible. The strategic side of unit formations and commands isn't there and so basically archers don't move with infantry. Archers also default to running to their own spot, so its hard to set up ambushes and defensive attacks if they're not near a stone wall (they're set up around the map)."
