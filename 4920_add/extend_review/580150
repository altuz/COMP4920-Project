,Not Recommended,580150,30122973,Posted: 23 February,all,Akiyo,"At its core its a good idea, but the developer outright lied about multiplayer only - there is zero network packets going in or out after getting into a game.Currently its a pure bot game that you CANNOT play with friends. The room list is fake, all buttons throws you into a bot game.Edit: 25 February's update added real multiplayer and have done away with fake multiplayer, but now its a massive jittery mess even on LAN connection, its technically possible to play now but don't expect a lot of fun when everything teleport-sync into position every couple of seconds."

One night when I was awake at around 3:00 am I got the cops called on me for noise complaints because I was having a really loud party, and like half my friends got charged with 5 year sentences for doing copious amounts of cocaine. Sometimes I reflect on this and I like to think I was the bigger person by fleeing my home and moveing to a small suburband town in Japan. Now I am happy and spend my time doing what I like so it's pretty chill here I guess."

,Recommended,580150,30496978,Posted: 13 March,all,Kovic,"For the price, its worth buying.I played this for about an hour to unlock almost every achievement and then let the game run (in-game) to unlock the last few time based ones.  Overall, a simple game to 100%Now for the gameplay-I'd like to point out this is early access and the developer is actively improving the game.During my time playing I came across a fair amount of glitches, like going through walls, being hit through walls, walking sideways, as well as a few times the game locked on me and I had to restart it.  However, with all that said, I did enjoy the game for what it is. I do wish the multiplayer worked better, but at least at the time of this review it is showing a sign of life, unlike the ""no-multiplayer"" it had at launch.My advice for anyone wanting to try this out -Shoot the presents, collect coins, don't worry about killing enemies at first.  Once you collect enough coins go to the store and purchase a good amount of upgrades (shooting/speed) then buy some power ammo and quickly take down the needed enemies for the achievements.This game is clearly gonna get mixed reviews.  I judged it based on what it is trying to be as well as the cost.  I didnt go into this expecting to be blown away and what I got was a unique experience with a few different maps and for that I am fine with the $0.99 it cost.If the multiplayer ever gets fully sorted out, I could see myself playing this with friends as a sort of time killer between other games.  I doubt it'll ever be a go to game for multiplayer, but still fun, even if for only an hour or two.Last thing, the camera movements can be a bit nauseating at times, so be warned, motion sickness could be a thing here.Social MediaTwitter -https://twitter.com/oneandonlykovicReviews -http://steamcommunity.com/id/kovicplayz/reviews/"

76561198035285721,Recommended,580150,31029942,Posted: 8 April,all,bigh  🌊 🌋 🌴,"""Parrots & finches at war""Xbird has two different kind of stories. One is the sad story of bionic warfare abusing animals for air combat. In this case birds are equiped with rocket launchers, turbines, helmets and targeting overhead displays. The other is a very fun game with challenging controls in zero gravity levels. There are also deadly traps like laserfields high tides or nukes with spinning lasers around. The controls must be adjusted over mouse sensivity 50%. Then it's perfect to handle. However your goal is to shotdown 40 birds and play for 130mins to unlock all achievements. Quite easy. You start with some finch. But to buy other birds like the eagle or the parrot you would need 5k or 10k points. Way too much if you earn about 1k in 2 hours. The graphics are quite good. Just the sound FX is not muteable only the music. And the MP still not developed."
,Not Recommended,580150,31525083,Posted: 3 May,all,mikistroz,"I would like to recommend this game, but unfortunately - i can't.I bought it for my friend on his birthday, but i didn't want him to play alone, so i got it too, because it was looking like a funny gag gift, and expected it to be something more than just an unplayable meme.  Unfortunately, i was wrong, but let's start from the beggining. After a few seconds of downloading me and my friend open this game. There is a huge metal gate with a sign saying ""Xbird"" on it. Well, okay, it seems like... a good start? After that, we are in the menu. There are a couple of options, bird selection, etc. We set graphics settings, and go back to play together. I clicked the button that said ""Create Lobby"", but... what? I instantly joined to some random game with 3 other players. I thought it was a bug, but no. It actually joins some random game, but when you are looking for it in the server search it has your name on it. Weird, but whatever. He joins, and we start playing, so let's talk about the gameplay. I started on the ground and almost couldn't look around, because the sensitivity of the mouse was set to the lowest possible in the game settings. I've fixed that, learned how to fly, and started fighting. And it was bad. The flying speed is low, which makes it hard to manouver, and just boring. The combat... eh. You just aim with your mouse and shoot fireballs at a low firerate with low speed of the projectile (because you have to upgrade it), you can buy other weapons, but they aren't even profitable, because they are expensive, so you lose money that you could potentially use to upgrade your stuff. Also, the zoom is just useless, because you can't almost see anything. The hit detection is bad, the servers are lagging. After the match there was a white screen with red russian words (don't ask me why) and immidietaly another map started. The level design is poor. The levels aren't really creative, just some ugly, random sceneries with presents and objects flying around. I know it's a typical ""meme"" game, and it costs 1 euro, but... why though? It stopped being funny after 5 minutes, and it's just boring and unsatisfying to play, so i don't think it makes any sense to buy this atrocious pile of garbage. If you don't know what do with your money - just keep it, and earn some more to buy a good game, or just donate it to charity."

,Not Recommended,580150,31088209,Posted: 11 April,all,Aquadude,"I like the idea, but lots of the mechanics and the multiplayer servers are broken.I wish that this game had better aerobatics. right now the flying seems floaty and sluggish. This makes the game really boring to play.Multiplayer is almost non-exsistant, anything you do theres a %95 chance that you will be matched with atleast one other player; and even then you cant tell if they are real because they dont have name tags above their characters.The thing where the laser ball in the center of the map as an obstical seems pretty lazy, maybe in something like the jungle map a rock or tree would fall down and change the map slightly.I dont really like the combat in this game either, you shoot endlessly. thats it. Like the flying, I would like to see this game turn more into dog fighting which seems like that was the intention.The maps I have a mixed feeling about because they look amazing, but they have alot of empty space in them.  I would like it to be more space filled to make the flying part more challenging and funThe matches are way too long as well. I feel like 10 minutes of one match where all you do is fly around  and spam the shoot button is really boring. maybe just ease the time down to 3-5 minutes?One thing I do like about this game is the soundtrack, im not sure who made it or where its from, but its pretty tense and catchy, but its pretty cheesy, which is okay in this case because its a game where you are fighting as HEKIN' BERDS.TL;DR, the game is waaaaay unpolished, and could spark up most, if not all of its mechanics. (but thats what early access is for, right?) After all, the game is only a few months old, and the developer seems to communicate well with the community and is doing the best he can to fix his game, which is always good.UPDATES---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Multiplayer has been fixed a bit, and you can actually join peoples games! yay! now we need to see name tags for players, atleast when you get close to them.I just found out that the music for the game is royalty free. how sad, I mean its okay to use royalty free music for your games but its a bit lazy."

,Not Recommended,580150,30021442,Posted: 18 February,all,Mr_Ward,"While the concept is entertaining. The game has a long way to go before its ""finished"". It lacks most things you would expect to see in a multiplayer game, and I'm almost positive every match has been nothing but bots. Of course theres no way for me to know for sure because there are no names, or a scoreboard, or a chat of any kind. The game feels very much like a asset flip/ card farmer, and alot less like a real game. Pretty much if you want a silly game and some cards for a dolllar (or less if it's on sale.) Then this is for you. If you want a multiplayer game you can enjoy with your friends this likily is not for you since in game at least there is no way to invite your friends or host a server/create a lobby."
76561198256110536,Not Recommended,580150,29817416,Posted: 9 February,all,McFlannel,"In its current state I can not endorse this game. At the start you are simply thrown into an area without any information on what the objective is. Then after flying around without any grasp of what is happening you are simply thrown into another arena and the cycle continues. There is no leader board or scoreboard so basically killing things is essentially pointless. The two positives I will give the game is the buy system isn't THAT bad, and the other is that the color scheme is amazingly trippy. I guess they tried to compensate for the awful gameplay by increasing the saturation. Playing the game is like a bad acid trip you don't want to remember.https://youtu.be/1E8IOzEXjnM"

Somehow confetti bursts out of the birds when they die.It's reasonably fun to play.There are a lot of bugs etc. though.25% of the game is written in Russian, which can be nice depending on your view, but I didn't like it.Bird can be hard to control.You can't fully look up, so you will be stuck at 80% or so, so a bird above you can easily hit you, while you can't even shoot back.When you are close to the ending of the match, your screen will turn completely white, even though the match is still going on.For some reason you can shoot fire balls through glass panes, which somehow leaves them intact, but when I try to fly through the glass my bird crashes into them.Overall this game was more fun than I though it'd be, but it is still not great.You can certainly get some hours of fun out of it, plus around 25 easy achievements and trading cards.Got it on a discount anyways."

The range of weaponry and arms available as well as the variants of Birds currently in game set the stage for some really interesting outcomes down the line.

After that, there was one other guy in the lobby who told me i too could have a ""lazer bird"" so because of this sleepless state i accepted. He required my credit card and social securtity number and i accepted. He gave me the instructions for making a lazer bird and i gave my end of the bargain. Since had no credit card, i broke into a few homes stealing magnifying glasses and laser pointers. To duct-tape to my pet bird, Richard. Later i became a wanted criminal for theft and was caught.

It is super boring and the sound never works leaving you in a akward silence. The game is very unfair pinning you up against ""other players"" that are twice your size and auto kill you in one direct hit. The reason I say ""other players"" is because they are very clearly npcs, they move extremely artificially and act like robots. The game it's self makes about as much sense as a inside out 3 headed donkey doing the hookey pookey on a twister mat. The character designs are bland and boring and the name Xbird makes no sense, the only reason people get it is cause it says the work bird in it. The games one map is horrible.

Couldn't recommend it highly enough. ***RE-EDIT******EDIT*** Not sure if it's just me, but since real online multiplayer has been added I've been unable to play at all. I loved this game but LITERALLY cannot play it anymore. I'll keep updating if this changes, but for now it is not worth a cent, I say this with a deep sorrow in my heart. 0/10 ***EDIT***A little janky with the controls, but actually very enjoyable as long as you aren't planning to rage and are easy going. The game play is fun and challenging, but very rewarding, with many badges that will make you feel accomplishment. Seeing that it's been less than 2 weeks of a release I'm very happy with my 99 cents spent. Give it a chance, I feel that this game is going somewhere. 7.1/10"

Actual feathery animals in digital form which you take into combat and hopefully win if you're a decent marksman."
