,Not Recommended,581030,32311601,Posted: 10 June,all,Redbeard,"I played ""The Last Hope: Trump vs Mafia"" for a while, and now I'm wishing I didn't.A story about Donald Trump fighting the Mafia sounds like it could be interesting.However, as it turns out, the game is about ""President John Trump"" (not Donald) being hunted by terrorists and the Mafia, although your enemies are all wearing military/security uniforms - but I've never seen Mafia guys wearing uniforms (unless the uniforms made for prison inmates count).So, it's neither about Donald Trump nor the Mafia.Sub-titling this game as ""Trump vs Mafia"" looks to be just a deceptive hook to get people to buy it, expecting some great story about Donald Trump battling the Mafia, but it's a no-go on both counts.There are clues that the game is a load of rubbish right from the start.You spawn in an office with windows which look into the meeting room next door, but that room actually has no door (apparently it's a meeting room designed only for people who have discovered the art of teleportation).That's your first clue that the game is badly designed. But if you missed it, don't worry, there are more clues pointing towards poor game design than there are windows in Trump Tower.I went downstairs to the awaiting limo, as instructed. Nothing happened. Walked around the car for a while (I was thinking that the game was broken at that point), but then suddenly the car activated, taking me to the next stage.The next spawn point was beside a couple of buildings - I walked towards one, and bumped into an invisible wall. Walked in another direction; again, I bumped into thin air (or very thick air, as the case may be, seeing it was a solid mass).Turned around and went into a military base.The instructions said to go to the aeroplane; OK, no problems. Walked out to the airfield, and saw two planes - which one was ""the aeroplane""? Neither seemed to work. Then I noticed that there was a third aeroplane at the far end of the field, and so I headed towards it.There were what appeared to be security guards in the area; when I walked towards the plane, they shot me. What the frick?Where's my gun? And if I'm ""President of the World"" then why don't I have any bodyguards? It's all pretty stupid so far.I decided to avoid the gunmen by going around some buildings, but then bumped into some invisible walls again.There is no indication whatsoever that these are areas you shouldn't walk into. It's just a case of really bad game design.Finally I got to the third plane, and it took off. You are subjected to some 1990s-style graphics of a plane flying, then you experience a totally unrealistic plane crash.Then you start the third stage, which is comprised of various destroyed buildings, with some more gunmen.Sometimes the gunmen just appear out of nowhere. I thought at first that maybe it was my imagination, but there were too many instances of it happening.One gunman was on the other side of a truck; I could see him because I was standing on something on my side; so I thought ""Cool, I'll just jump up and shoot him over the top of the truck"", but suddenly, *zap*, he was there right in front of me. Maybe he was another teleporting aficionado?Smeg that for a joke. Stupid game (or stupid me for buying it).Aside from being a bit annoyed, I was getting pretty bored by this stage; the game just wasn't very exciting at all.When you get to the end of all the buildings, the fourth stage starts (following a cut scene of riding on a train in the dark, where you can't really see much).You're at a train station. There's a flashlight on the ground, with instructions to use it to fight your enemies.What the frick happened to my perfectly good M16? Did I accidentally drop it whilst I was fumbling for my train ticket?This is stupid.So I start fighting gunmen with a torch. Even though they're armed and looking right at me, I somehow manage to beat several of them senseless.Torch vs. guns, torch wins - who knew?Finally, I get killed.Do I continue on from the last save point, or do I go outside to do something much more exciting, like watching grass grow?The grass wins.This game is a great production for making people realise that they shouldn't be sitting in front of their computer on a nice day.If you have any friends who spend too much time on their PC, buy them this game so that they'll play it and subsequently run screaming outside.Or gift this game to people you hate, so that they will be traumatised for life.1/10 (it gets a 1 for having Steam cards).Don't buy this game.And if a ""friend"" gifts it to you, don't accept it, because they actually really hate you and want you to be traumatised for life."

But i can not give The Last Hope Trump vs Mafia a positive review because it is to buggy and there are to many design flaws in it. The Last Hope Trump vs Mafia is a cheap indieshooter, i think, mostly build with bought assetts. I have no problems with that and played a lot of games with bought assetts and liked them. But here, they are not good placed in it, a lot of them are flickering or parts are missing. It does not look very good. Besides that, the graphics and sounds are ok. The worst part is, that killed enemies transforms into standing skeletons. Thats just awfull. Then, there many parts, were you just have to wait, a car drives endless around and the same with a plane. It is not very good. The shooting is ok, like in most unity games, but there are no options in the game. All in all, i can not recommend the game. Please watch my video of the first 18 minutes, all the mentioned points can be seen there.Gameplay Part 1https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olVU93dDKBUGameplay Part 2https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAztA_a1EkYGameplay Part 3https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nkzixGGoTA"

There are invisible walls in every corner, the mechanics are awful, the physics are awful. Don't buy this game.... Just dont..."
,Not Recommended,581030,30656452,Posted: 21 March,all,DankPastaMaster,"Don't buy it, it's horrible. And I don't mean it's humorously bad, it's stupid. There are no pros, maybe the fact that you might be able to refund is one. Bad english, looks bad, terrible graphics, level design comparable to a 9 year olds xBox Minecraft superflat creative world, the instructions and tutorials can only confuse you, controls are stupid, in game it says 'Jump - Backspace' even thought it's a space bar. No ingame settings, incredibly difficult and not in a fun way, frustrating, overall a very, very (or very really as the game says) bad game. Even with a -90% off coupon it's not worth it."

76561198066556321,Not Recommended,581030,31639873,Posted: 8 May,all,LeadPaintChip,"Purchased for some quick fun and laughs. Invisible walls (don't even keep the bad guys out, they can walk right through it), shadow shows you with a gun, you do not get a gun until AFTER the airplane. Bad guys die as a standing skeleton.  This game has more bugs than Trump-care had loop holes. Honestly surprised this got the OK to sell on Steam.  This is not the game I voted for. I should have voted for Minecraft, at least they know how to build a wall.Edit: One last thing, you know for sure you are not playing Trump as the player's hands are big enough to handle the weapons."

The graphics look worse than Gary's Mod, enemies pop in and out of existence and then phase through walls to shoot you, hit detection is all over the place, there's a loading screen every two seconds with a one minute chapter of you riding a crappy plane or train and then BOOM another loading screen, etc. I can't tell if the developer made this game to be intentionally bad or not."

Enemies literally turn into upright skeletons when killed.Oh and I was shot multiple times by enemies through things that I could not be shot through. I also saw enemies going through walls. 10/10, my dude. JK. Don't buy it."
