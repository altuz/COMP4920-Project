I bought it for the art alone and was not disappointed in the least. I spent a lot of time just marvelling at the exquisite talent behind the Memories scenes ~ props to Salon Alpin for fantastic work! You can get lost in the beauty of the art and also the incredible music, which fitted the game to a tee. This game surpasses all others in terms of the art style.The gameplay is basically spatial puzzles and connect-the-lines puzzles, which is not too taxing and quite fun but also frustrating in parts. Just the right mix of light difficulty to leave you plenty of room to fully enjoy the immersive visual experience and the very endearing old man, who I lost my heart to.Thank you Broken Rules, for an incredibly visually rich and melt-my-heart game that took my breath away with every scene. I don't think I have taken this many screenshots of a 3 hour game in my life. THANK YOU!!"

The best thing about this game is the abscence of text. No tutorials, no tool tips, nothing. Would recommend highly.It would have been very nice to get a few more hours out of this. The full playthrough was around 3 hours for me. With this great game I would have wished for more."

In my opinion it's still worth the price if you like a slow-paced game, with a puzzle element that isn't too challenging. The art style with flashbacks is beautifully executed and the story is touching."

The puzzles you encounter are very simple to solve and finishing the game is much more about undergoing the experiences of the titular old man than to fry your gray matter.That being said, the unique artstyle of the game along with the beautiful music make for a very enjoyable and touching experience that I would gladly recommend to everyone. Give this one a try folks!"

You help the old man on his journey across both gorgeous hand-painted lanscapes and accompany him on his trip down memory lane. It is short, but touching, simple yet satisfying.This game is for you if you enjoy at least one of the following:- beautiful music and art- relateable and emotionally touching stories- easygoing drag & drop puzzles (by shifting the landscape)- playing games with non-gamers in your life (children, S.O., parents)This game might not be for you if you are annoyed by one of the following:- lack of options / customization in the settings (the devs are working on this though)- short game time- easygoing drag & drop puzzles (no harcore brainteasers here)- characer-driven melodramaAll in all, I think it is well worth to accompany this grandpa on his bittersweet hiking trip. The value proposition works for me, especially knowing how much time and effort went into creating the gorgeus world you traverse."

The art style in this game is amazing i mean hats off to the artist you did an amazing job! The way you interact with the game not only sliding layers of the land, but other smaller details such as knocking on doors or opening windows when you click on them just completes it for me. At this stage i havent finished the story completely but at this stage the story is great.A problem i do have though, while i was playing there was no exit button unfortunately.9/10 Game would recommend for anyone after a simple wind down game.~Ausdragon"

,Not Recommended,581270,33239739,Posted: 4 July,all,TheMediCat,"Old Man's Journey feels like a project with so much potential -- wasted.When I came into this game, I was thinking it would be an epic journey that would bring this man to reflect on his life along the way, learning from mistakes or making more, trying to redeem his past sins or... something. Ever read Siddhartha (the book)? I thought it might be like that. What we got... was a subpar puzzle game with an uninteresting/cliché story, downright boring gameplay, with a pretty face. There's not much to talk about because the game is so short --- The only reason I have 3 hours is because i left it running at home when I went shopping and returned 2 hours later.The game is nice to look at, but its nothing special. It doesn't stand up against, say, Ori and the Blind Forest. Exploration is not interesting though, because the game is completely linear, and the environments are fairly similar and repetitive. Although, you can play this on pretty much any computer. It is not graphics-intensive in the slightest-- which is good for me, my computer is sh*t. The puzzles rely on two basic, maybe three mechanics if you really nitpick. That's it.What if this game had been told like a classical epic? An Odyssey, or a spiritual journey which would bring both the protagonist and the player to a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them? Unfortunately, there's nothing here worth spending 8 dollars. Go find something else.P.S. If you do know of a game like the one this could have been, please let me know! =)"

,Recommended,581270,35215057,Posted: 25 September,all,ElusiveOne,"Old Man's Journeyis a cute storybook adventure, contemplative and relaxing, in which you bend the land to move forward.Traverse lovely serene landscapes. Sit and rest at every opportunity. Displace sheep. Observe a series of charming flashbacks rendered as beautiful live paintings, where the happy memories become progressively sadder.The game's single original mechanic lets you manipulate smooth curves in the ground to significantly alter perspective and solve a minority of light physics-based puzzles. Simple, clever.On the down side, the game is very brief without replay incentives. Some stuttering during the train segment and texture glitches in underwater scene leave room for improvement. Otherwise it's a uniformly excellent and heartfelt adventure.Make sure to change the game's default low resolution to your native optimal settings to properly enjoy."

,Recommended,581270,32748312,Posted: 24 June,all,HODGE THE CAT,"This game left me with a strange feeling. I lost all sympathy with the egocentric old man rather quickly when I learned why he is on this journey of redemption, and didn't regain it even with the ending you see coming a thousand movable hills away.The simple concept is well executed, though, with a little journey through a beautiful landscape. Is this a puzzle game? Maybe for my youngest kid. Maybe. The simplicity of the puzzles made the journey at times somewhat tedious and stretched. That said, the music and art are tonally perfect, even if the narrative left me annoyed.It's a game I'd recommend for the overall concept and experience, not for the story or puzzles, which I realize is a very half-hearted recommendation."

The puzzles are interesting and refreshing. Even though there is just one main mechanic in the game, they take it in so many directions that it keeps it fresh. The story is very touching and exceptionally well done for a game with no dialog at all. And i'd say any game that keeps my interest while you only use one button to control the entire game deserves a recommendation.If you like games that focus on art, story and interesting puzzles. Be sure to pick this gem up."

Amazingly welldone in showing the story of the Old Man through picture-like memories, sounds and relationships.

There are no other game elements, only map conversion. It's very boring after 10 minutes. I did not finish the game, but it seems to be very short. The graphics are beautiful, the music is quite average (the best track is in the trailer). The story is not too original, I have seen it many times. It's a big disappointment. I asked for a refund.

The gameplay was weak and exceptionally easy, causing the gameplay to lose any engagement. The narrative was typical and bland. There was no nuance to it, that being what makes a narrative really worth following. There was some good use of the environment to reflect the mood of the main character as well as having the main mechanic be somewhat novel.Despite this, there is not enough inOld Man's Journeyfor me to recommend it.For a longer review, see the video above or read an extended review at:Vinrafel"

The music helps immerse you in the touching plot and light pastel colors are combined beautifully to create the levels where the environment itself is the puzzle. It's so refreshing to see a point-and-click game that doesn't make you collect items, so in that way it's quite reminiscent of Samorost 3, another great game. There's no dialog, but thanks to the game's simple mechanics, it's not too difficult to figure out what to do to progress. The game may be short, but the story is well expressed in a coherent way that makes it feel like it didn't need to be longer. Lastly, I like how you learn by exploring rather than being taught through a tutorial, it makes it so much more fun and it feels more like an accomplishment when you succeed at a puzzle. Overall great game!"
