,Not Recommended,581520,31400081,Posted: 27 April,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"I really enjoy Wanaca’s art style. Even so, their art isn’t enough to “save” this visual novel. It’s pretty much like all the Sakura games but with pervert “magical girls” and a MC that barely does anything. The story is short (even with the R18 patch), and honestly, it’s boring. Yes, I know that the developers are targeting a certain audience (porn only and no story apparently), but even like that I don’t find this game satisfying.The ending was so abrupt too. Is this going to be a “series” like Sakura Fantasy was supposed to be? Let’s hope not, since SF was actually good and was abandoned. Also, I saw on their Patreon that their income is around $14.000 per month. I’m not a specialist, but I think that with that money (or even less) it’s possible to make something new without the cookie cutter type of story they always use.2/10. I recommend getting this title only if you already follow the Sakura series and want to complete your collection. Just that."

Its literally the same repetitve crap they throw in. Do not buy, at all. Complete waste of time and money.REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP.S. Don't be a weeaboo and be salty over a trash game pls."

,Not Recommended,581520,30252034,Posted: 28 February,all,Zibang,"So I finally gave this series a chance after seeing them include proper h content in them, I thought maybe it could actually be a decent nukige now. Well let's just say I feel rather disappointed, all the h scenes are really short, terribly lackluster and lack climax (literally, WHY). It's just a bunch of teasing, the real scenes I was promised were never delivered. It just ends abruptly and I was expecting something more with all the teasing, and made me really frustrated. In all honesty you miss nothing if you just look up the art from elsewhere, since it's rather enjoyable at times and there's no voice acting or animation in the game anyways.The series is the cheap cash grab I was expecting it to be, but it really could be a good nukige if they just did things properly. No one in their right mind would ever read these class E VNs for their plot anyways."

Only six choices, a bit over 2 hours of reading time (but I read fast).Easy way to get a perfect game.Bought on-sale, not really worth full price, especially when compared to Sakura Fantasy or Sakura Dungeon."
,Recommended,581520,31851190,Posted: 19 May,all,The Angry Sakura Game Nerd™,"this one ended up being just ok for me. the story seemed a little too familiar to many of the other entries in the sakura series and the music was just random bits from the other games copied and pasted into one track. the characters as usual in these games do still feel pretty fresh though and don't necesarily feel like they are recycled from the other games. the dialouge in this one seems to be a lot more comedy focused than the other games which is nice to see. I played through some of it without the adult patch and to be completely honest, the adult patch actually fills in some scenes that make no sense without it. basically, without the adult patch it pretty much just says ""and then they ♥♥♥♥ed"" on the screen and skips over anything including what dialouge takes place over the adult CG. as far as the *ahem*... quality of the uh.. art, character designs and each girls' CG looked pretty good in this game.overall, if you are buying this for the porn and want to support the winged cloud team, do it. but if you are looking for a SUPER SERIOUS DRAMA FILLED ROMANCE VISUAL NOVEL avoid all sakura games. these VNs are meant to be enjoyed and give a comedic feel like a rom/com ecchi anime, not taken as seriously as a Triple-A title."

There isn't much substance besides watching buxom beauties fight evil... and lose their clothes. The achievements are simple to get: choose every top choice the first run through, and the bottom choice the second. The trading cards are nice to look at.There is a patch to make things more explicit. I am unsure how much it adds to the product."
