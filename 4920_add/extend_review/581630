,Recommended,581630,32568124,Posted: 19 June,all,[ACPL] Jon,"Potential for something great, but the game is IMO not quite there.Pros:- very original ideas (clean up after you kill, grappling hook, traps)- very satysfing kills with gadgets and sword throws- very good ragdoll mechanics- very good parkour mechanics- decent stealth mechanics- plenty of gadgets and ways to beat the level- good animations for enemies- for a minimal graphic design, it looks fine and somewhat stylishCons:- for a game with such basic models, it doesn't seem too optimized- gunplay is very unsatisfying, melee could be a bit better- get on the high ground and dudes with swords won't do a thing- not much modes to play with, same with maps- (subjective) gets boring after a momentFor a 3 euro game it's not a problem, it's still one of the best spent 3 euros."

,Recommended,581630,31599580,Posted: 7 May,all,Advanst,"This review has become somewhat out of date due to the game actually being updated (Yay <3). I might redo it at some point.TL;DR:This is a game that seems to take aspects from Hitman and Superhot, and just mashes them together, a concept that I thoroughly enjoy and recommend. Lots of different ways to accomplish the main objective, plenty of different tools to do it with.Full review~Description~30+ enemies per level, up to 8 gadgets, 6 possible weapons, 4 maps to choose from, 4 difficulty options, 3 available objectives, 1 game. Sword With Sauce is a game that you wouldn't really expect to do so much while looking so simple. You can wallrun, run & gun, scale stacks of shipping containers, smash people from above, 360 noscope, and a whole lot more. Depending on which mode you choose to play, you're either simply trying to kill everyone in the level, trying to do so without being caught, or just killing endless waves of baddies. The number of settings and gadgets that are available give you many options of how to play the game.~Movement~The movement in the game may feel somewhat sluggish at first, but, at least in my case, I got used to it fairly quickly. On top of your normal WASD movement, jumping, sprinting, and crouching, there's a whole parkour system. Wall running, wall jumping, wall scaling, and mantling are great additions to the flow of the game, and really just add to the number of methods or paths you can take throughout a level.I can't say the parkour system is flawless, but, it feels buttery smooth when just running around and jumping off of stuff. The general physics of jumping, wall running, and all that feels oddly natural and easy to pick up if you've played First Person Shooters before.9/10, the only thing that makes it not perfect is the timing windows of some of the actions are kind of tight, and can result in choking runs of whole levels from a simple improperly timed button press.~Gunplay~The gunplay is something I'm not particualrly fond of, but it gets the job done. The automatic rifle, the shotgun, the pistol, and most other projectiles have a hefty travel time, which can be pretty gosh darn frustrating when trying to save ammo, or just get an efficient kill.There's a handful of nitpicks I have relating to the guns. One of which being the fact that the crosshair still shows up when you're aiming down the sights of a gun. Another is that, even if the enemy unloads half the magazine in an automatic rifle, when you pick it up off their body, it'll be at the maximum ammo in the mag. The ammo nitpick doesn't really bother me, as it'd probably hurt the gameplay if it was more accurate, but it's worth mentioning if I'm nitpicking.!!! The paragraph that was here was a complaint about a bug related to aiming. It has been made obsolete by the update the devs put out on May 17th (Alpha 1.5.7)http://steamcommunity.com/games/581630/announcements/detail/1268172671068879959Anyways, the gunplay is one of the only negative aspects in my eyes. 4/10 when taking the bugs and nitpicks into account.~Weapon diversity~With 6 primary weapons, 3 of which not being guns, it's important that you know what you're getting into with each of them.Automatic Rifle - A simple automatic rifle with a 30 round magazine. Fires at a moderate rate, is inaccurate when moving, and on any difficulty above Easy, takes multiple shots to the body to kill.Shotgun - Deadly and threatening up close, 6 shells per full load, and practically useless when not point blank. The shotgun's spread is so inaccurate, you'd be lucky to hit an enemy a couple meters away.Sniper Rifle - An instant kill on any difficulty when delivering one of the 6 shots in its magazine to the torso or head, the sniper rifle is not just the only hitscan gun in the game, but it can penetrate walls, floors, ceilings, and multiple enemies as well.Bow & Arrow - With physics affecting the arrow's trajectory, the bow & arrow unfortunately requires a bit more precision with its shots, but it gives the massive benefit of delivering one-shot headshot kills and being completely silent. One of the main drawbacks of the bow & arrow is the requirement of having the quiver equipped as one of your eight gadgets.Katana - Requiring multiple slices to the body at higher difficulties, but only one swipe to the head, the katana may take more care and precision than you expect. The blade boasts multiple positives, including silent kills, being thrown as a projectile, and even protecting you from bullets and other sword strikes with a well-timed block.Shield - This weapon will make you feel like a bumbling idiot at first, but within a handful of minutes, it'll feel as if you're a true Captain America. You can reflect incoming bullets back at the source, or even other targets. If that's not enough for you, go ahead and throw the shield to see it bounce between nearby enemies and back at you if you're within range. Just make sure you're there to catch it as it comes back.I give the diversity of killing tools a chill 7/10, as there's a lot more that can be explored and added.~Gadgets and maps~At the current time of writing, the map list is fairly small, with there being just 4 maps to choose from, those maps being Mansion, Harbor, City, and Atrium. There's not a solid difficulty curve from map to map, but (At least to me), the maps do get more difficult as you go down the list.The gadgets are pretty interesting so far. With options such as a drone, HeadTraps, deadly gas, a gas mask to protect you from that gas, coma darts, De-Crab-itation, and black holes, you're sure to find a favorite out of the 22 available gadgets. There will be some gadgets that are obviously more powerful than others, but they're all worth trying out.While there's not much to say about the maps and gadgets specifically, the map design gets an 8/10 from me, and the gadgets get a 9/10, mostly thanks to the wide range of available gadgets to mess people up with.~User interface~It seems like this is the the thing people talk about most with this game, but personally, it doesn't bother me. The main menu, gadgets menu, etc., could all use some work and polish, but I think they function relatively fine. Good enough for an alpha, and it seems like it's come pretty far already.Not the smoothest thing in the world, lots of room for improvement, but certainly functional. I've seen better, I've seen worse. 4/10.~Music/Sound design~The audio inSword With Sauceisn't anything special, but it definitely gets the job done. The music can get repetitive if you're just going in and dying over and over, but the music isn't a big deal. Now on the SFX end, the levels could use some background noise, such as wind blowing and birds tweeting on Mansion, waves crashing on Harbor, etc... The gun sounds are okay, footstep sounds are alright, but the levels themselves sound empty beyond those.Overall the music and SFX aren't bad, but they're not amazing. 5/10 because hooray for being right in the middle.~Overview~It's certainly no AAA game, but it's not some indie garbage. Give it a chance and you can have a lot of fun and a pretty decent challenge. With 8 hours in the past few days, and probably a decent amount of time in the future when I just wanna boot it up and blast some baddies, this game has more than paid for itself with entertainment in my book.A fantastic 8/10 indie game in alpha with a bright future if it continues to get updates, totally worth it for $3USD."

You use various gadgets and weapons to eliminate all the enemies in a given level, but with different game modes, maps, and enemies, along with your variable equipment, the game stays fun even when running the same scenarios.

,Recommended,581630,30125217,Posted: 23 February,all,jbondguy007,"This is more of a placeholder for a future review than an actual review, since the game is still in alpha (or heck, pre-alpha, really). It is also to show some support for the developer as this game has lots of potential, but lacks considerably in content.I paid a total of CDN$3.29 for this game, and let's just say that I certainly do not regret my purchase. The game is great fun, and as I've mentioned before, has the potential to become something great. The core gameplay design is there, and you can already get a feel of what it could become. It honestly feels more like a demo than a game, but it's a hell of a good one. My favorite feature is probably the somewhat slower bullet speed of the guns combined with the ability to wall-run and jump, and drop down a skyscraper without breaking your legs.It allows the player to dodge enemy fire while closing in for the kill. And I mean, how freaking awesome is it to drop down from the roof of an office building to land your sword right into the skull of an enemy below?Of course, the game definitely needs some polishing, and if you don't like unfinished games, then obviously skip it. Wait until it's developed further. We should also keep in mind that it does not appear to be guaranteed that the project will ever be finished, as it depends on the funding acquired through Steam early access - to quote the developer:""I won't be able to follow it through as far as I would like without some financial backing. To avoid the Kick starter ""crowd funding"" Technique I have decided to release it in early access in hopes that the game will prove its own potential and pay for itself.""So if this game sounds like it has potential to you as well, why not go ahead and grab the game for $3? You'll support the development and also have some good fun with what is available to play so far."

,Recommended,581630,29607192,Posted: 31 January,all,MinecraftKid2003,"Note: I will be updating this review as often as possible(even more so with future updates)(This review has been updated)Normally I only buy games that at least have a couple hundred reviews and a very positive rating. Many times I don't risk getting games that are very early in development. But after seeing the trailer for this game, I had to get it! It seemed very unique with a mix of action, stealth, parkour, and even a little bit of secret agent abilites in there with special gadgets. To be honest, I was very pleasantly suprised when I tested it out!Obviously, despite me enjoying the game very much, it is not perfect(hence the game being in alpha), but it has the potencial to be! I have not tried out every aspect of the game so far, but here are some pros and cons that I have found in my short game time:Pros:1) Cool gadgets you can use and play around with.2) Fast and intense gameplay if you decide to take the non-stealth route.3) The ability to choose your main weapons as well and take weapons from the npcs.4) Cool level designs which give the opportunity to do parkour and stealth attacks.Cons:1) Enemy AI could be improved. Sometimes, they see you really quickly from a very far distance and other times you are right in front of them and they can't see you. Also, when you kill an enemy, other enemies don't take notice of this.2) Some of the weapons are not very easy to use. For example, the hook could be used for a lot of awesome stealth attacks, but many times it doesn't latch onto surfaces correctly.3) A few bugs here and there(of course it is alpha but it is worth mentioning). Sometimes, when you fall into water and try to respawn, it spawns you back into the water again and you have to restart the level completely. Also, one time it flung me across the screen when I used the hook and I was stuck in the air.(I haven't found anything else yet, but I will post more if I find anything)4) Stealth could be improved a lot more. Fixing certain weapons(and maybe even adding more stealth weapons) could be very helpful! Also, the enemy AI needs to be improved more so it can feel more like a stealth kind of game.Things I hope to see in future updates:1) More items to use against enemies(in world and gadgets)2) More stealth and non-stealth levels3) The ability to choose how many enemies there are in a level and other options for levels as well4) Maybe a point system to upgrade your character and also the gadgets you can use depending on what level you are(it could be more of a challenge that way)5) Being able to save your options(I have a terrible computer so it would be nice to have it remember my options so that I don't have to go back and turn it down to Medium every time I start the game...yes I am lazy lol)6) Maybe a multiplayer or coop mode. I know this could be hard to do, but it would be a nice feature!7) I will think of more as time goes along.(Update 1.4)This update is actually a really great one! It seems to have made the system run a lot smoother and I am very happy about that! Also, the ability to change more of the settings such as changing key binding and mouse sensitivity are useful! I honestly don't need that option, but it could be very helpful for others. Also, I noticed that it is a little easier in difficulty. The shots from enemies don't cause as much damage. Again, this wasn't a big problem for me, but some had mentioned that the game was very difficult, so I am sure people won't rage quit as much lol :P Finally, the developer fixed the bow!(yay) I am so happy about this! It helps the stealth part of the game become so much more satisfying. Anyway, it was a great update and I can't wait to see more!Final NotesIn conclusion, this game has so much potencial to be amazing! I am excited to see what is in store for future updates. If you would like to get this game for an amazing experience now, I would recommend to wait. While it is good, it still needs a little more work. But if you would like to support the dev to help him to get to that point and still have a fun time with this game, it is definitely a good buy! :)"

If you like being badass, you'll like it. And if you like action single-player games with ninjas, you'll definetly like it. While I was consumed in this world, I felt like a real ninja. Wallruns, roof-hooking, stealthiness, tactical usage of a vast majority of available gadgets - that is all waiting for you in this amazing game. This game doesn't even need a story or a big amount of levels to be interesting. You just enjoy creating different tactics or performing astonishing kill tricks. Here are some pros and cons:Pros:Enjoyable gameplay that will consume your interest for hoursYou are a NINJA! And it really feels like itVast variety of usable gadgetsGameplay that improves tactical thinking and stealthNice looking, minimalistic graphicsGame is constantly updatingCons:Small amount of bugsThe last update made jumping on the roof edges more annoying. Now, you look down everytime you go up on the wall/floor what makes it much more ugly looking and gives you headache after a while. Yes, it is adding some realism, BUT COME ON! The gameplay is much more important is such game.The game doesn't look the same as it is in trailer anymore (thanks to the new update)Small amount of levels (but this isn't a con really, because the developer will be adding new levels)So, overall, this game is fantastic!

,Recommended,581630,29797192,Posted: 9 February,all,Zadok_m,"I wanted to write a review to try to get the word out for a masterpiece of a game like this. I know I'm saying that for an early access game that literally came out a couple weeks ago but this game is so much fun with close to no flaws aside from a couple early access bugs as well as the fact that I just want more and more to be added.You ever wanted to be a ninja in a videogame? Nonono not a ninja like Ryu or Genji where youre only bound to your signature abilities. Like a real one who utilizes stealth, acrobatics, different weapons, gadgets, and their own reflexes to take down specific targets or come out on top against a huge wave of bad guys. Yeah well this game lets you do just about that. You are a walking death machine against all odds, an action hero ninja guy against a huge amount of enemies. You can choose to approach each situation stealthily or go all out and shoot, slash, and freerun your way through your opponents, leaving a path of destruction behind you.The game has 3 different maps. City, Harbor, and Mansion.- City is a map put together with a few buildings with enemies inside and on the roofs of the buildings, as well as the floor crawling with baddies. You can use a lot of jumping and freerunning to gain the upper hand on bad guys, as well as jumping from building to building to make an escape- Harbor (My favorite map) is a dock with large supply crates everywhere, enemies at every corner, as well as a little boat to board- Mansion is a small little villa with one large building a couple smaller little shacks. It's very closed quarters and in my opinion, the hardest map to play on.Theres also 3 different gamemodes, however I've only been able to play two of them so far- Normal: Youre given a number of enemies to kill and you have to take them out without dying- Ninja (The one i haven't tried yet): Same as normal however you have to do it undetected- Survival: Fight against an endless wave of enemies and rack up as many kills as you canThere are a scarce amount of weapons to start out with so far, but what they have right now feels very unique.- Bow: A stealthy projectile weapon that has to be equipped alongside the quiver gadget to be used. Completely silent and excellent for doing stealth only missions- Rifle: Basic machine gun, Iron sights, stuff like that, not much different from other shooters- Sword: A katana that basically oneshots anyone it touches and has the fastest melee attack. It can be thrown to oneshot enemies and can block bullets at the cost of speed- Shield: Literally Captain Americas shield, blocks and reflects bullets back to enemies, a oneshot melee attack that's sort of slow, and it can be thrown at enemies and can ricochet off of walls and other enemies and is able to return to you.There are a ton of gadgets you can use. I won't go over all of them because there are so many and they are not required at all. They are still a really fun additon to either increase your chances in a fight, or give you more opportunities to take during stealth.There are currently a very small amount of flaws with this game but the ones they have shine bright. The freerunning gets a bit broken at times. Youll try to climb up or run along a wall and youll just bounce off of it. The guys with shotguns can completely oneshot you, ruining your entire streak and forcing you to restart. Finally some of the AI is just broken. You can run in circles around a person that has you spotted and eventually if you end up behind him he'll forget youre there. It's only ever happened to me like twice so I wouldn't say it's that big of a worry.Overall this game is one of my favorites and is an amazing start for this early access game. It's super cheap too and worth even more than what the dev is charging for it. 9/10 I really cant wait for them to add more."

The simplicity of the art style doesn't fill your eyes but is still pleasing to see. More simply, it's fun to have the choice to either act with stealth or go full in. There are a few blips and bugs but that's to be expected as it is in early access mode; it hasn't been fully polished yet.One of the only things which bug me is the lack of options for the game and user. However, it is positive to see that the dev  has stated they will be adding more options.Overall, a great pleasure to play with a few minor bugs. Nonetheless, the potential is there."

But what is there is awesome!I played through and beat both the mansion and habor using the default setup. The mansion was a *mostly* stealth run. Habor, I just went wild with the sword since the layout is a little more difficult to map out. When I started up city, I finally decided to check out gadgets. Don't make the same mistake I did! Check out gadets ASAP!Sure, you can go with a bow as your starter weapon, ala Far Cry. You can go with the default sword. You can go with... honestly, I forgot what the fourth thing was because THE SHIELD, the freaking glorious shield! Have you ever want to play a FPS Captain America? The game may not have Marvel branding, but the shield made me feel like I was in the Avengers. It's got the multi enemy bounce. It's got the bullet ricochet. It's got the boomerang return.Outside of my obvious love for the shield, there are quite a few gadgets for just an alpha game. Drones, black hole generators, shock gernades, traps that automatically headshot people when they get close, coma darts, ninja stars, and a mop... to clean up the blood stains, if you want to play super stealthy.My complaints about the game? Needs more levels. Also, it needs better controller support. I was able to map all the buttons I wanted, but I wasn't able to map my look. Strange that I could do buttons but not look. *shrug*Point is, for $3: get it. Get it, get it, get it. As the game stands right now, I can see myself easily putting 10+ hours into it."

There are none of those limits in this game.You are free to roam around the levels, taking out your enemies any way you see fit.You start off with a sword and from there, the world is your oyster.You can appraoch your enemy, knock the gun out of his hand, grab it, and blow their heads off.You will also have a bunch of gadgets to help you out with, like ninja stars, and grenades, only to name a couple.There is also an element of parkouring in this game as well.Like Super Hot, the graphics are minimalistic, but that works to it's advantage I find.Less is definitely more.But just remember, that this is an early access game, so it still has a way to go.So in closing, for the reasons listed above, and for the low price of 3 dollars, I definitely recommend everyone to try out this game.Fun, simple, and addictive.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeLSFyLauQ&list=PLGCO4EfbVB6XXoAnQMUJjoEh3c2BLfHx8&index=73"

,Recommended,581630,30545801,Posted: 16 March,all,Jazzdude,"What a nice, promising surprise!Even though (or just because) I only paid about 2,49 € (2,99 $) I went in this with little expectation, ready to get a refund. However I am absolutely pleased: Sword With Sauce (in the following 'SWS') is a rough little gem, that with enough polish will become a shining little star in the flood of garbage early access titles.The game is absolutely simplistic: Choose a bunch of tools and a starting weapon, a game mode, a level, kill the bad guys - done. But just this simplicity is what makes this game so interesting for me. Sometimes you don't want to dig in the story, or run through a 10 min+ tutorial. You just want to jump right into the action. And SWS is just that. Trial and Error action that is perfect for a quick game inbetween.As of right now you can choose between three maps (Mansion, City, Harbour), four starting weapons (shield, sword, machinegun, bow) (with the option to obtain a shotgun only from enemies), and about 15 different gadgets, from gas grenades, to a wall-climbing-hook, to night vision googles.All of these gadgets work perfectly. Including good working drone controls!Enemies will die in just a few shots/ punches or one sword slight. So do you, you will restart often in this game. So if you did not enjoy f.e. Hotline Miami this game maybe not the one for you.However ones you get the hang of it, you get in a killing spree of insane flow. You can optain weapons from fallen enemies and adapt quickly to situations by switching f.e. from sword to machine gun. You can jump through windows, change weapons precisely with a time slowing weapon wheel. It just feels great!Right now the game has some flaws with enemy AI, controls and definitely needs more content! The AI sometimes seems to spot you from across the whole map, sometimes they walk right next to you without recognizing. The climb abilty needs some work and the hookshot (or however it is called) definitely needs to get its range extended.Another problem is that you not only can not turn off motion blur, but the blur also affects your weapon wheel, which makes it unreadable when falling down.But all of this is nothing that can not be easily fixed.The biggest ""issue"" if you want to call it that, is definitely the content (maps, weapons and gadgets), but keep in mind, this is only an alpha-version of the game.So if you can spare the price of two coffees, this def definitely deserves some support!Keep up the good work!Sorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language.Sincerly,Jazzdude"

,Recommended,581630,29533130,Posted: 27 January,all,「SUNBOAT」,"It's like Superhot met Hardcore Henry.There's (currently) a decently-sized selection of items. And you WILL die in a few hits. However the weapons you get range from hard mode (Bow) to HOLY ♥♥♥♥ I'M KILLING EVERYTHING (Sword). Any weapon you select defines your playstyle. My only gripes are that the shotgun isn't selectable from roundstart. The AI can move too fast around corners, making it hard to hurt them. And the guns, FOR THE PLAYER. Do little to no damage. And headshots with the bow don't seem to register, either. Aside from that, it's a really good game for being in early alpha. Did I mention it's three dollars? Three. YES. THREE. There's also some bad translations, but I'm only talking about a letter being misplaced. I reccomend you try to do the level as quickly as possible.ALSO : Climbing. It's pretty clunky. Please fix this.ADVICE FOR THE DEV : Please make the items and weapons use hotkeys. (E-G 1 main weapon. 2-9 items) using the item wheel severely drags down the pace. If you could select what you needed at the tap of a key, it'd really help the pace of the game, and the replayability.I wholeheartedly reccomend this game. Hell I'd reccomend it if it were $5. It's a great way to kill an hour or so, or for 15-30 minutes if you're on a plane and have nothing to do."

I was like ""Okay one level? I paid 3 bucks after all I cant really complain."" So I get through that mansion level perfectly with stealth. (i skipped the tut btw) hehe but anyway. The game plays like a standard ""ctrl to crouc h"" and ""shift to sprint"" game. BUT DID YOU KNOW YOU CAN WALL RUN?! And run UP walls.

While it is true that accuracy reduces over distance, it doesn't hit a certain point and then just start flingin' bullets everywhere, I'd expect them to fall into the same general direction.Aside from these three points there isn't anything overly bad about the game, it is very promising. There are a very limited number of maps but I haven't included that as a point since it IS and Alpha.

The game currently has 3 game modes to play on. The normal mode gives you the goal to kill everyone on the level. You get a huge amount of gadgets and weapons that you can set to your own play style. You can play this game however you want. If you want to go in to a level and try to take everyone out steathily, you can do that. There are many gadgets to help you do so too like a grappling hook, a gun with a silencer on it, coma darts, temporary cloaking device. Or you could go in to a level and try topower your way through. Other gadgets include things like bombs, spear traps, homing blades, X-ray goggles. There's too many gadgets too name and they are all useful. There are also different maps to play on too. The current ones are the Mansion, Harbour, City, Atrium (which is a futuristic city), and Temple. All of the maps offer cool options to go about completeing your objective. For example, on the Harbour map there's a giant boat that you can make your way on to and you can start from there. Or if you wanted you could start in the crate area and then move up onto the boat so that no one from the docking area notices you. Or with the City map theres an elevator you can go on that takes you to the top of one of the sky scrapers and can give you a good vantage point of where everyone is. The other two game modes are survival, which has you going up against an endless wave of enemies. And the last and hardest mode is Ninja mode. Where you must defeat everyone without them noticing you or anything suspicious. It's very easy to fail this mode because if they notice a body or blood you left behind, you lose. But luckily there is a gadget to help with this. The Clean gadget cleans up any blood you leave behind which is almost neccesary for this mode. The game is only in Alpha and it has SO much potential and is already an amazing game just from what it has. The development team seems to really care about the product giving updates constantly. And have announced that the game will be getting multiplayer in the future. I completely recomend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun action game or just a fun game to play in general."

,Recommended,581630,31711832,Posted: 12 May,all,Gazpins,"Sword With Saucemay be one of the best games you can purchase at a regular price of less than three fifty. It’s surprisingly smooth and functional for an early access title.Gameplay is pretty simple, you’re placed in a stage and have to eliminate all the enemies using whatever means you like. Prior to playing, you get to choose your main weapon as well as a healthy amount of gadgets to take with you. Stealth is an option and enemies have a few levels of awareness. Movement is full of parkour and wall-running that feels similar toTitanfall.Weapon selection is what makesSword With Sauceso much fun. I’ve gotta be honest, the shield is one of the main reasons this game hits it out of the park for me. What other game can you use a shield to deflect bullets back at people and then toss the shield, having it ricochet off multiple enemies before flying back into your hands? [If you have an answer to this question, I’d actually love to hear it!] You get to feel like a ninja Captain America who can throw his shield as he’s sliding across a wall. It’s pretty cool.Enemy detection does seem a bit spotty in terms of line-of-sight / range, but consideringSword With Sauceis a WIP, it’s passable for the time being.A complaint I have are the enemy spawn locations being the same each time you play a stage. If you’re trying to do a stealth run, this can be helpful in terms of knowing who you need to take out and where you went wrong, but if you play more aggressively, it can make things a bit repetitive.One thing I’m a bit concerned with is the developer continuing updates. The game has only been out for a few months and there seem to be monthly updates from the dev. I’m optimistic, but still a little weary. As far as I’m aware, the dev is a single person making the game and it may be a passion project that they can’t dedicate all their time to. I’ll try and be hopeful because I’d love to see content continue to get added.The suggestions listed below are mostly for the developer, but I’ll leave them included just in case anyone else is curious on my thoughts. A lot of them are opinion-based and not things that would necessarily make the game better.Suggestions for general content and quality-of-life changes:- (Very minor) The ‘p’ in “Exit to Desktop” is slightly cut off on the “You Win” screen. [I play on 1920x1080 if that has anything to do with it.]- Some gadgets should probably have gravity added to them. The destruction disc can be thrown like a Frisbee that doesn’t stop until it hits something.- A firing range where you have access to all weapons and gadgets (maybe even on one giant wheel for ease) so you can taste range + how to lead with weapons or use items effectively. Could have NPCs standing still and some that pace back and forth at walking speed as well as run speed. Button that resets enemies.- In my opinion, bullet speed needs to be upped a little bit for the assault rifle, and a larger amount on the pistol. At this point in time they feel sort of like foam dart guns in terms of speed & predictability. Considering the pistol is silenced, I’m assuming the slow speed was added as a balance thing. Perhaps try having an increased initial speed or adding bullet drop so that it remains effective at close range, but still wouldn’t be very usable as that range increases.- The ability to use (some?) gadgets while still having your main weapon equipped. It’d be cool to still be able to use throwing knives while having a katana in your hands. Sometimes it slows the pace of things down having to open the menu and shuffle between things. It may have to depend on the gadget because you could be a bit overpowered otherwise. Grapple would really become more useful with this.-Enemy map layout. Have the option to choose from A, B, or C positions, or to pick one of those at random. That way you can go in either not being sure what to expect, or to know the layout and practice a specific way of handling it.- Option to sacrifice a gadget slot to have greater quantities of the other equipped gadgets.- A coliseum-like map where all enemies have swords. [This might be terrible or could be neato.]Gadgets:Body Armour (passive or toggled):Gives you more health or damage resistance but slows you down or prevents parkour.Tripwire:Similar to destruction discs, but since they have to be manually placed and not thrown, they have a larger trigger radius.Sticky Grenades:Stick to enemies without them noticing and are remotely detonated.Taser:Very close range instant knockout. Can be used even if detected and it’s a front-facing enemy, but has limited charges to balance between exo-knife.Stealth Kit:Allows you to walk past enemies without being noticed. Breaks when you shoot or execute an enemy. Maybe allows you to lay traps without it breaking. Either has a one-time use or can be used multiple times as long as you’re undetected.Arm Cannon (main weapon):Shoots mid-sized energy balls semi-automatically. Right-click shoots from a limited amount of missiles. Maybe unable to throw, so R melees with it. [Sorry, I thought of Metroid + Mega Man and thought it would be cool.]Power Boots (passive or toggled):Allow you to run faster and jump higher but you have less damage resistance. [This game really gives me the vibe of your character being some sort of super-being, so I think some items to accentuate that would be cool.] Can’t be paired with Body Armour.I was anticipating this to be a quick review. Woops!If you found this review mildly entertaining or useful, please consider checking out my Steam group / curations. It’s chock-full of my awful sense of humour <3.Thanks for reading."

Looking forward to the updates and the eventual release of this game!Sword with Sauce continues to impress me with every update and bug fix. The development team (though it might be one person) truly cares about their game. It's a great experience and I can tell you personally that beating the Ninja game mode has been one of the bigger challenges of my gaming history and it was probably the best I've ever felt when gaming when I finally beat it."

While running around you have a great and smooth parkouring system that allows you to effortlessly glide across the maps.So far this game has only three levels, two of them big and are great to parkour around.

The movement and combat are a little janky, still, but honestly not as much as one might expect from an ""alpha"".  It takes a bit to get into the ""flow"" of things, but not too long.  The biggest complaints are that, one, some features aren't explained very well, and the tutorial isn't as clear as it could be, and, two, it doesn't support a game pad terribly well.There are movement sets that are easier than they might seem because of that, but mostly the ""Forge"" system isquitea bit more robust than it might seem.  There, you can create custom settings, from things that affect just the player, to things that affect just the enemies, to general settings about the game.  You can save these and upload them to the Steam Workshop, but the main thrust is to use them as an additional ""mode"" when playing one of the five levels.Over all, it's a very good game with a lot of options, rewarding both action-based combat and stealth, with so much potential to become even greater."

The enemies are really fun to kill and stow away when you play on ninja difficulty, and the levels are really intricate, spacious and very fun (im using this word a lot).that being said though, there are still a multitude of bugs and glitches that on many occasions slightly soiled the experience for me. the throwing weapons and traps like the sticky lightning on many occasions have fallen through the floor, the throwing stars and arrows sometimes not shooting out despite it using up ammunition, and generally speaking the projectiles just dont like the windows within the levels, phasing through them and what not. The parkour also has some issues, especially the ledge climbing, where there were several times i had to spam the jump button as fast as i could to get onto a ledge with wall jumping.But, despite these problems i have with the game, its still really enjoyable and thrilling when you hop around, killing guards left and right, pretending to be a badass ninja assassin.Things that should be added (in my opinion):- Multiplayer (This game would be INSANELY fun if you play it with friends)- More weapons (Guns, daggers, traps etc)- More enemy variations (Maybe guys with throwing knives, parkour enemies, heavy gunners, stealth enemies etc)- More enemy move sets (swordsmen throwing their swords at you, gunmen shoving you when you get too close, all enemies with guns running away rather than just the snipers, swordsmen dodging your attacks etc)OVERALLSword With Sauce is really fun, has lots of bugs but it doesn't entirely take away from the enjoyment, definitly worth getting if you have a few extra bucks in your pocket, it's definitly worth a buy.Note:its also best played on Ninja difficulty if you want to go full stealth"

Especially holding the possibility that it can become significantly better. Sadly enough it has a long list list of glitches, but that's why it's still in alpha. You shouldn't expect a full game from this because, it isn't a full game. None the less, it has a surplus of potential and fantastic gameplay, at least when it works. The climbing controls may be a bit clunky, but the climbing wasn't even in the prototype for this game, so we are only lucky it is in the alpha. I had played the protopype for hours on end, and I would've  liked to consider myself a master, but it's challenge is insignificant compared to this. Ever since I realized there was going to be a continuation in it's production, I had become extremlely impatient.

Intel HD 3000 chug to about 14-22 frames, even lower on the mansion map. This is pretty bad for a snap-reaction game.-AI Upgrade: I Stabbed two guys in front of 3 guys, crouched and stepped to the right and they began wandering around for me. True story.-Windowed Mode: Oddly big deal to me. You can force it to do so with Shift + Enter but it'll revert back whenever you return to the menu.--------------------------------------If the things above are deal breakers for you, give it a month or two.

I'll list some of the things i'd like to see in the future.1. I'd really like to have the option to choose to play either during the day or at night to make sneaking around a bit easier as enemies have long line of sight (which is a good thing btw)2. A way to distract enemies like rocks in Far Cry 3 and magasines in Metal Gear TPP3. I think that the bow should take more time to draw.4. The tablet that you control your drone with should have higher resolution when you arn't controlling the drone5. Giving us the abilty to bind gadgets to keys for example grapling hook to F and so on6. Grapling hook give you the ability to climb vertical walls by throwing it on top of let's say the house7. Bullets should be WAY faster than they currently are8. Maybe some character customization that would make you choose from weak but fast and heavy but though armors and maybe some other types too9. Co-op and PvP would make for a really nice mutiplayer gameThen some weapon ideas:1. silenced or suppressed pistol2. Sniper rifle3. Crossbow (modern with rifle level precision)4. Baseball bat that knocks enemies out for a cerntan amount of time5. Bare hand to strange to death or unconcius (none bloody way to kill)I don't know how diffcult thease are to make so sorry if i sound too demanding

Let me list off some pros and cons.Pros:Awesome ninja-like gameplayVarious weapons to choose fromA HUGE assortment of gadgetsMany ways to play (Stealthy, Guns blazing, ect.)Multiple mapsThe AI is pretty good, not spot on, but they can hear you if you walk or run behind them, making it vital to crouch to sneakily kill.The list goes on, but here are some of the consCons:This is my biggest one, no windowed version. Now before anyone says anything, I don't mean it's only on Mac or anything, I mean you can only go fullscreen, and once you do, it's hard as hell to get out of the game unless you press the exit to desktop button, but since I record games for my YouTube channel, I can't really do that. I'd like a way to click out of the game to go do something, and be able to come back without having to restart the entire game. Also, sometimes when I exit a level to go back to the main menu, my screen gets boosted off to the side, which I don't think is the game's fault, but rather my monitor's fault, but I can't get a new monitor atm, so a windowed version would be appreciated immenselyThere aren't a lot of maps, (Only 3) but the ones we do have are fun ,and I'm sure the dev(s) will implement more maps in the future.The grappling hook is kind of broken. I'd suggest implementing an aiming system that will lock on to the ledge you choose, have you grapple to it, and automatically have you climb up it. I just think that this will make the game a lot more fun.But yeah, that about wraps it up. Once these changes have been implemented, it'd be a game I'd happily play 24/7 XDI'd recommend this game to anyone and everyone."

It seems like such a simple game, but there are just infinite amounts of ways you can play it. I would like to see some multiplayer capabilities though. Perhaps some maps designed for teams of ninjas against more guards than normal, but the game is still in alpha so it is understandable that this is missing. 6 hours in, and I've only just mastered 1 map with 1 weapon, using the same 1 strategy, so there are definatly many more hours of entertainment to come, even though the game is in alpha. So far I've only used the shield and dang is it overpowered if you know how to use it. It behaves like Captain America's shield kind of, boucing off multiple enemies and then returning right to you, just in time to deflect a shotgun blast into an enemy's face. Absolutely worth $4. Can't believe the devs aren't selling it for more than that."

These gadgets include known weapons as a gun, a shield and a bow, but also real film like gadgets for example a black hole grenade or see-through walls glasses. By combining the destructive and deadly power of these different gadgets the player has to take out all 35 enemies on the map. While in the missions the player can also pick up the weapons of his fallen victimsWith the help of great music, the usage of the different gadgets and rather dumb enemies the game succeeds in creating a very exciting atmosphere where you often think ""wow that is an intense situation"". As mentioned before a great asset of the game are the different gadgets which are designed quiet well and in a good amount of variety. Although the game has these good gadgets its also the part where, in my opinion the game could improve a great deal. Because every added gadget would give the game some 10 minutes more of fun game time.With the different gadgets the player also can create his very own play style in the game and even try out different tactics and systems every time he plays. This fact gives the game a great fun and casual playable ability.Some negative points as for example the graphical presentation must be addressed to. As the people are drawn quiet ugly and the different levels look ale very sterile as there is for example no furniture in the different interior spaces, no plats or cars ore something else moving in the outside spaces.I also see a opportunity of improvement in the controle menus as the circular ""gadget selecting"" menu is too unpractical. Another part where the game is improvable is the mode system as I can instantly think of 3-5 different modes that would be interesting for the game like a prison escape mode for example.But as the game is still in development it is in place to hope that the game will improve on this points as it is already a more than playable game. And I often found myself thinking ""I could play 15 minutes of sword with sauce"" which I most often did because it is good casual fun.http://architectonreview.blogspot.com.tr/2017/03/sword-with-sauce.html"

Stirring often, bring to a low boil.Reduce heat to low and simmer for 2-3 hours stirring often.For the first half of the simmer time, do so with the pot uncovered, then cover.Add the cheese, stir in and simmer for an additional 5 minutes or so.This will make the equivalent to 4-5 jars of sauce, and the cost is probably about half (and it tastes way better)."

I think there could be improvements, but it is unique and fun to play, for a short time.I have some improvements I would really love the developer to consider, the first and most important being, there is little game time. Now you could argue that replaying levels and things like that increase it, but, that gets really boring. I know the game is in early access so I wasn't expecting tonnes of play time but if you do add more maps maybe try and change it up a bit more as well, by maybe adding civilians and maps which are focused more on stealth.Another point, which I know most likely would've been added anyway further down the line of this games development, is co-op. This game would be sooooooo fun in co-op. You could add 2 player actions like boosts or distractions. Maybe make unique gadgets like ammo bags that a person could drop down; that would be awesome.An idea which I think would just make the game more enjoyable would be traps and when they are set off there could be like a fatality cutscene of the person dying due to your trap.Finally, please try your hardest to remove the bullet travel delay, add more guns and make ai a bit more intelligent; they are too easy to beat at the moment.If you're thinking of purchasing this game then do however, dont expect any of the above, the main reason I bought this game is becasue it seemed fun but I also knew this would fund the final development of the game."

You want to use poison darts and silenced pistols while parkouring around the level to slowly pick away at the enemies without beining detected? You can do that to, and it's increadibly fun to do so. You can beat the hardest diffculty with ease by hiding on a roof and sniping but it's not about wining, it's about the way you win.

Remote detonated AoE shock mines, seeker crab mines, a grapling hook, X-RAY GOGGLES, Remote controlled drones, not to mention the captain america style shield[bullet proof(ish, more on that later),bouncy, throwable, seethrough, and totally indestructible] and your amazing parkour skills. I'm like a kid in a candy shop. Despite the game being a bit small, and a few glitches, Sword with Sauce is great fun to play. A story mode where you have to go around and kill high value targets or something would be cool.In all seriousness, unfotunately, I have run into a few problems in version 1.5 of the game. The new atrium map seems to be a bit laggy, while all other maps are totally fine on my computer, the turning on the drone really bugs me, and that the shield is rather disappointing; It doesn't always chain bounce, its ability to block bullets is extremely unstable and I will often get shot anyway, and weather designed or not, it will not always return after hitting an enemy. Overall, I believe the game is good in its current form and if it continues to be developed like this it could end up absolutely amazing.Edit: I just discovered the sniper rifle added in 1.5 can shoot THROUGH walls. Totally unrealistic. You know what else is unrealistic? being able to jump off office buildings without being hurt, grappling hooks as this game uses them, blocking bullets with a sword, bouncy bullet proof shields, ninja stars killing people, X-Ray goggles.

Attracting many people to the game using its unique gameplay and, overall look. Some people say it’s graphics aren’t the best but, others who play the game responds to that may be that of something like this “The graphics aren’t supposed to be very advanced or good looking but, simple and neat.” While others might say something related to this “The graphics are just bad and low quality the devs are probably to lazy to make anything better.” To me this comment is just idiotic and probably came from someone who's never played the game before but, saw it in a video on youtube or some other site.The game sword with sauce has many interesting mechanics but, it's still in alpha so there is still many bugs and glitches but, I can assure you that the developers are working very hard on making this game the best they can. The modes of the game are simple there is normal which is just eliminate the enemies. Then there's ninja which you can't get caught in or can’t get suspected. The last mode of the game is survivor which you have to live as long as you can with endless waves of enemies but, there is one extra thing every forty kills you get a resupply of gadgets (I’ll talk about that later in the document)  to allow you to continue defeating enemies.The most famous and most recognized mechanic is the idea of gadgets while you're playing the game you can click the assigned key or the default “Q” key this key as long as held down will bring up a menu called the “gadget menu” this menu shows the current gadgets you have selected you can also change what gadgets and even the weapon you’ve selected in the game’s main menu these gadgets range from silent to just out right explosives and surveillance like a drone or a trap like the “head kill” there is even extra ammo for guns or bows but there are two items that are in their own category the masks these two items are the gas mask which allows you to walk through another gadget called the gas grenade which spews a toxic gas. The second of these few items is the goggles which allow you to see enemies through walls but at the cost of the ability to see far away.In sword with sauce there are two ideas of what the word “sauce” means in the title the first theory is that it refers to the blood to be a condiment or just not blood. The second theory is that it refers to the gadgets in the game.In the game sword with sauce there are three levels so far these levels are :First the mansion with a large entrance with many other exits or entrances it is considered to be the first level of the game mainly because when you first start the game it is the map selected :second map is the harbor which has a few features the main one being the many metal boxes on the dock the next one being the boat and the last one being the water this is the only level with complete open space but to keep you in this space there is water anytime you go in this water you die because apparently you don’t know how to swim the second feature is the boat this feature is interesting because you have to parkour to get on the boat. And the very last map being the city: the city is in closed in a wall with one road leading in but stopping you from leaving the map is a invisible wall the very unique feature of this map is the elevator fore this map is the only one with an elevatorso far in the game the next feature of this map is the many buildings that you are able to enter with the many entrances and exits of each one you must be very careful of each enemy and be aware of their location. To conclude this reading I would add that all of these points are my own thoughts and documentations of the game any of this information could lead to be false in the future do to the game being in alpha still and to that I plea sorry but, this game is very enjoyable so please support the game and buy a copy of it so it can become a better game with more content."

This is that, mixed with stealth if & when you want (on easy) or, you must stealth (on hard). And I like it. Bout time! This is a good deal, because there really is a lot of content here for $3, and it's good content.This game has many things that games should have as a no brainer, but many these days don't. Namely; OPTIONS; ways of approaching the completion of the level, and TOOLS with which to scale the mountain. A plethora of tools, in fact, in this case, to choose from.+ It's lots of fun. Simple and somewhat unadorned, yet different, minimalist yet immersive, unique style and lots of fun. You feel kinda like Jason Bourne or something.+ Guards on balconies and through windows that you can throw throwing stars and darts at.+ Find your own path, different playthroughs each time.+ Grappling onto the roof.+ Impale and skewer by throwing the sword.+ Customizable loadouts with lots of fun gadgets.+ Awesome forge mode where you can edit lots of game settings for enemies or for the player+ Slashing through enemy gaurds, throwing the sword at them, quickly picking up their shotguns and smgs to take them out, dropping the used weapons on the floor in true ""lobby scene"" fashion and manner.+ Grabbing weapons out of the air from your latest kill is awesome, especially when used to continue your spree.+ Wallrunning doing all of this+ Lack of more than one mag per gun keeps you on the move and the blood pumping and perserves that ""lobby scene"" like attitude of dropping guns after a few bullets are used like its nothing, which I love! It's epic and fun and invokes feelings of badassery.+ Deflect bullets with your sword, awesome+ No, seriously, the wall running, movement, and sword is really awesome.+ Cool and well done level design, needs moar maps+ Guns, style and bullet & blood effects are cool+ Higher difficulties and Ninja mode are a great challenge+ You can drag bodies to hide them and clean up blood with a broom, which is humorous.+ Cool Concept. Good Instant Action. Strong Feel-like-a-badass concotion.+ The stealth and other weapon sets are unique, innovative, full  and sweet in a manner that is rare among games today, gadgets are cool and fun to use.= Good stealth game.I approve, I'm glad someone made this. Very fresh.I like that you can opt for stealth or wall run-and-gun and slice everything to death. Shotguns and rifles at close range can still kill you though, which is good.I would rate this as a pretty badass way to spend $3. My cup of tea.Glad I stumbled across this.The detection is less forgiving on Ninja, but on normal you can usually run away and be hidden again pretty easily.Killing every enemy undetected can be very difficult, so finding the paths to do so is fun, though losing at Ninja mode repeatedly can feel a little punishing. You have to customize your loadouts until you find what like to use and feels natural.What I would like to see in future version of this game is, everything could be just a tad bit smoother. And, well the music's not that bad, it fits the setting, but maybe a few varied sneak and combat tracks for the different maps would be less monotonous soundtrack. I guess most people might listen to their own music anyway. The music isn't bad though, it's fitting, just could be more interesting sometimes.Things that could be added: Music, Maps, Revolver/Desert Eagle/Magnum, Versus, Co-Op, MAYBE a few gadgets but not too many more weaps/gadgets needed but a few new ones might be nice nothing too crazy good source of ideas would be weapons like the laptop sentry gun from Perfect Dark, (a small rapid fire gun disguised at first as a laptop; secondary fire launching it ontothe wall as a small sentry gun with limited ammunition) not to copy, but that game has a lot of guns with cool alternate fire modes like that to draw ideas such as the laptop gun from.Perhaps a sheath to keep the sword in one of your other slots and carry two primaries? :o Always having a sword would be handy.This game has a lot of cool things going for it, hope it continues in the same manner."

What do you have to do? Well it’s easy: Kill all ennemies  without beeing detected (Sneaky Beaky Like)! You start with a sword and kill an ennemy. If that ennemy has a gun ,you can take that gun and shoot other ennemies down. But the only thing is with that gun it makes much noise and you only have 30 bullets. No bullets left? No problem, throw that gun into the face of an ennemy and then with your fists kill the enemy . Ow and if you do it with only the sword, you can also throw the sword to make a kill! Nice, isn’t it?About the gadgets well lets say short: you can use from  guided ninja stars to toxic gas! Also you have also some gadgets to protect you like a gas mask (good to use when throwing toxic gas grenades!I like that fast action first person shooter! It’s in alpha but hell yeah thats a good one."

I LOVE THIS SH*T!You know how amped up you felt when you watched the first trailer for Superhot?  Before you found out that it wasn't in real time?  That is this game.  Someone played Superhot and thought ""This game would be great if time didn't keep slowing down.""  The action is fast paced and adrenaline packed.  While playing the game I feel like Batman if he were played by John Wick.The game is still in Alpha, so there is A LOT of things they need to improve upon.

At first, I thought it was a poor man's SUPERHOT, but after reading the early access description I realized that this game could become so much more. I love the graphics. They re simplistic but the animations are on point. Great job with the blood effects. Surprisingly realistic even though the enemies are black shadow people basically. The gameplay feels amazingly smooth, and the crazy amount of mobility you have keeps the flow of the game smooth once you master it, like Hotline Miami. Once you add the campaign and maybe a multiplayer later, I don't think it would be a crazy idea to bring the price range up to SUPERHOT or even higher. Just maybe not $60. That threshold is, unfortunately, the line where players, expect a game of that price range to have triple A graphics, regardless of the actual gameplay. I'm sure you weren't thinking of bringing it up that high anyway. With continues development from the community(I will definitely participate), I think this game can become an amazing title that definitely surpass SUPERHOT(sorry for making comparisions. The art style and gameplay are pretty similar). Keep working hard! I will be telling all my friends about this game(please add multiple online multiplayer gamemodes as a reward for my mini-essay review.). 5/5 :)"

,Recommended,581630,31251746,Posted: 20 April,all,A'den,"Before anything else: This game is good. I mean for Alpha game. Main goal is to eliminate all enemies on one of the four maps. I shouldn't be judging game by what it's not, but I dont feel as if there was any reson, any justifications for these killing. I mean - in any other game there is a reason - in XCOM you have to kill aliens to save the world, in CS:GO you kill players for your rank, or dunno, Men of War - you kill to capture area and so on. Here? You just kill nameless black figures. Sure - since the very description it was stated that that was the only goal. Anyway, just my ranting.Getting back to the game: during my playtime I haven't encountered any major bugs ect. Game does very well what it stated. Killing is relatively simple and quite enjoyable. Stealth part is quite weak - especially when one of the game modes is Ninja mode in which you cannot get detected. Thing is, only 3 maps have decent places of hiding corpses, eg on Harbor map you can dump them into the water, on Atrium map you can dump them down from the building, and so on. But that doesnt really help, because there are often crowds of enemies patroling some place on each map, which makes it impossible to eliminate them quietly. Little hickup. In normal mode you just have to eliminate all the enemeis in any way you want - once you break the stealth, nothing stops you from from going guns blazing and shooting your way through the map. Last game mode, Survival, is all about staying alive as long as you can and wasting as many targets as you can.Other than katanas and firearms found on the corpses (AR, Shotgun and Sniper Rifle) you also have gagets. There are plenty of them, from having additional few mags for weapons, grapling hooks, sleeping darts to pocket black holes. Some of the decriptions are missing though.There arent major bugs,but there are few small ones, eg swords not deflecting bullets (Tutorial said they should!), but ifs fun. For 3 euro, why not?"

,Recommended,581630,30265346,Posted: 1 March,all,PapaDelta138,"Okay, so there's not much you could go on with this game. But so far, the game has been really good. It's likeSUPERHOTwithout the time concept, and added difficulty, and violence. You have ninja skills and you have to dispatch your enemies either silently or by going loud. It's your choice.Pros:It has a potentially high fun factor. There are only 3 levels, and 3 modes, but since it's a pretty new game, and it's steadily growing, I think that'll be taken to the next level.The game is visually appealing. Still feels kinda empty, but it's a pretty new game, so I suggest you give it time.Nice price tag. I don't think it'll ever go on sale, but hell, $3.00 was worth it. Being an Early Access game, you'd think it'll be around $10 like any other typically alright game. But it's not. And for that, I applaud the devs for being very considerate.The only game in which I get to playlikeCaptain America. The game uses a variety of tools for you to use to kill your enemies, so experimentation with stuff isn't out of the question. It can be a fresh experience every time you come into the game, so yes, there's replayability. I mean who the hell doesn't wanna be Captain America, right?!Cons:It's unfinished. Like, very unfinished. It's in Alpha phase.The controls are weird for me. Jumping sucks in the game.The blood is meh. I hope the devs insert oozy blood that actually oozes out of the enemies, instead of being 2D stickers on the floor.The difficulty is a little too high. I think on normal, it should be, in some way, forgiving. I can't do stealth without getting caught atleast once, and the rope doesn't exactly help as much, because as I stated above, the controls are very weird, it'll take a lot of time to get used its timing and all (for example, catching the ledge of a wall).No trading cards, no Steam achievements, no leaderboards... WHHHYYYYYYY!!??? :(((((The soundtrack... please, change it, it does not fit with the game at all.The doors... must open... the other way!!! It ruins my flow!Verdict:It's fun! And it's definitely worth the buy! And it's actually one of the games I've kinda always wanted... or atleast in terms of the design and the mechanics of it. One could actually get over some of the cons I've mentioned above and still have fun, so don't think that because I've stated more bad stuff than the good stuff that the game is bad. It's not.  If it improves, it's gonna keep me up for hours. So, please buy the game at full price, the devs need it, as well as deserve it.Personal Note:I hope the devs introduce some sort of slow-motion toggle mode. Can you guys imagine doing everything in this game, in slo-mo? Seeing the bullets fly at you, and then you dodge them before they hit you, doing stunts with the shield by throwing it with utter accuracy, knocking down multiple enemies --- all of this, in slo-mo. Shoot, I'm convinced this game can be ridiculously fun if it had this bonus introduced into it.Also, a sort of replay system. If you completed a level, you could see how you did. If you did a level in slow-motion, then maybe you could see how it turns out in normal speed via a replay, at the end. Just something to think about, devs!!!ALERT:I will say that the game is still on Early Access, which means the full version has not been released yet. So far, I have not encountered any bugs. Buy the game only if you want to support the developers (or if you want to satiate your curiosity)."

,Recommended,581630,30644695,Posted: 20 March,all,Molten,"Short Review: Like Superhot but actually fun. At 3 dollars you can't go wrongLong Review: Hard but fair. Honestly could be harder. Since it's alpha I will cut it slack, but I see the potential in this game. I don't know if the devs will actually flesh this game out more or if this is just a tech demo, but either way I am satisfied with my three dollars spent.So let's talk about the game.The Enemies:They're like you, but grey. They have about the same health as you, and do the same damage as you. However they are not very smart. The AI will be holding a rifle and see you from across the way but run until it's 10 feet away from you before it starts firing. Not very smart.On top of this they aren't very fast. You can always run away from anyone unless there is a hailstorm of bullets after you. The guys with the swords seem to have the best AI for chasing, but they do not perform parkour or jump and that is a little sad.I would love for them to implement special enemy types with more armor or helmets or ones good at parkour and chasing, and even faster than you. Would really up the intensity of playing the game. As it is you could beat all 3 levels (and yes there are only 3 right now) doing stealth if that's what you're into and it would be super easy. With that said, it's much more fun to get ridiculous and try to do action movie stuff.What the enemies lack in coordination and speed, they make up for in damage and numbers. Each map you start with about 35 enemies versus yourself. That may not be much in your average game, but since the enemies have the same HP as you and do the same damage, you will die many times trying to complete the levels unless you approach it with a logical mind. However, the AI is so dumb, I think approaching it logically takes the fun out of it. It's much more fun to wall-run and jump from buildings throwing swords and stuff but that's my personal preference.The Weapons:There's three. A katana, a rifle, and a shotgun. Katana kills in 1 hit. Rifle is like a nerf gun but if you land a headshot it's usually 1 hit to kill. Shotgun is good in close quarters but you can't look down the ironsights like you can with a rifle which is a little annoying.There are gadgets as well. Some of them are interesting. I think they mostly take the challenge out of the game. You have what is essentially a sleep dart, a spinning razor disc that if you throw it anywher near an enemy it homes into them. That one's actually my favorite. Then you have some goggles, but I'm not sure what they do. There's this thing you put on a wall and if an enemy walks by it, it hits them with a spike, however there is only one charge. There's also an electric grenade you trigger with a remote, and a regular grenade.Oh and there's a grappling hook but the parkour is clumsy making it useless a lot of the time. In theory you should be able to grapple yourself to the top of a building or container but often times when you reach the top it doesn't give you the ""Climb"" option which pops up and you press spacebar to climb ontop of something. Instead you'll grapple to the top of something you want to climb on, and when you press jump, you will jump away from the object as if you are kicking off of it. It's very annoying, and I don't know why that command is even in the game - if you're not wall running it's essentially useless.The Levels:Right now there are 3 levels. Mansion, Dockyard, and a City. I like the city level the most, the mansion is more close quarters which actually makes things easier. You think it'd be hard but since there are so many choke points you can just wait behind a door for all the AI dummies to funnel through.The dockyard level is the most frustrating as when you beat all the enemies, you have to get onto a boat which requires climbing on top of shipping containers, and then using the grappling hook to get to the boat. This is an exercise in frustration, especially when you've beaten all the enemies on dock. This could easily be fixed by adding a bridge onto the boat, but I think the developer overestimated how much people would enjoy the parkour.The Modes:Right now there are 3 modes. Normal, Ninja, and Horde mode.Normal is just normal. You have regenerating health and anything goes.Ninja mode you have to complete the level without being detected.Horde mode, as you guessed, is just an endless wave of enemies.Personally I'd like a hard mode where you don't regenerate health, and a time attack mode where you can compare scores with people, or even just see your best score.Obviously it needs a story mode - or at the very least a challenge mode with special requirements for each level.Cons:No story.No missions.Only 3 levels.When I drag enemies I can't look around with my mouse, and I can't pick them up in the air to use as a bullet sponge. You may think that's a ridiculous complaint, but ttrust me, you'll be wishing you could do the same thing.Parkour could be betterCould be more gadgets as they're nothing specialOverall:I don't know what the dev's intentions are for this game, but if you are looking for time to kill and you enjoy these types of games I would definitely buy it. 3 bucks is what? Half the price of a deli sandwich? You won't miss the money, and you'll enjoy the game.Highly recommend - just wish it had more."

At the low cost, you can't expect much, but this game still is worth checking out. The weapons are certainly interesting, but not all of them are unique. The game offers decent challange.As this is an alpha game, instead of my usual review style I will simply list off some of the things I believe need attention as development progresses.The movement is fun once you get used to it, but it certainly needs refinement. Crouching should get you through more areas, like the windows in ""Mansion"" once the glass is broken. A slide/tackle option would be nice, something to perhaps knock enemies off their feet.The stealth options are interesting, however I have a coutple of complaints:there needs to be more option for silent killing enemies from close range, such as dropping on them when you have the exo-knife equipped. Heights are always the best way to go to avoid enemies in this game and many others, and as it stands sneaking while you drop off a ledge forces you out of sneak and thus makes a loud noise when you land from even small heights, eliminating the possibility of dropping down behind an enemy to sneak up on them.Lastly, the maps. I realize that this is an alpha game, and that the devs have other things to worry about, but the most important aspect of a stealth game is the map. You have many cool abilities in this game for getting around, but very few opportunities to use them. Hidden paths and alternate routes are a must in a stealth game, and while it's clear the devs have tried to implement them in a few places, for the most part you are stuck to one or two paths to get to where you are going. A simple ledge you can access only by wall running, a vent running between rooms, anything of the sort would help.In conclusion:A dedicated team and a little inspiration could turn this game into one of my favorites, however at the moment it is not worth much. I look forward to watching this game progress and I hope that the devs can draw out it's full potential."
,Recommended,581630,31411521,Posted: 28 April,all,Club Soda,"For a cheep, early access game it's actually really fun and has a lot of challenge if you try to go for a stealth run. It doesn't have a lot of levels but It isn't finished so I can only assume that they will add more due time. I also hope they put in a level editor because that would just give this game endless amounts of fun. There's not that much of a reason not to check this out."

76561198372278755,Recommended,581630,30456791,Posted: 11 March,all,harman.ransii,"This game, is an absolute delight to play. I am new to PC gaming, and this game has been more addicting than some other games I bought, such as Rainbow Six Seige. Though the outline of the game is more simple than the other games I have bought, it brings together a unique first person game. Borrowing the gameplay style from Far Cry, as well as adding features such as basic parkour and special weapons, makes this game brilliant. Though normal mode in this game is not very entertaining, stealth mode pushes your stealth abilities to the max. As a Far Cry player, I am accustomed to infiltrating camps without being detected, but in the series, enemies can find individuals you have already killed and the player can still recieve their stealth awards if avalible. However, in this game, in the ninja mode, you cannot even have a body detected, or you fail. With approximately 40 enemies on each map, this can be stressful, yet very addicting. In survivor mode, since there are infinite enemies all in a cautious or detected state, you can focus more on creative combat, especially since weapons such as the sheild work like captain america's sheild, and how the gadgets in the game can assist you. Though the game currently has 3 maps, it is definetly still fun, and in my opinion, every map but mansion is worth giving a try (mansion feels enclosed and less open scale, which is more ideal in my opinon for a game which has modes which emphasize on both combat in survivor mode and stealth in ninja mode. The only suggestions I would give this game is to make more "" playground maps"" (such as city and harbor) and replace some rather useless gadgest (such as the stick which can be placed down anywhere and become part of the geography of the map to make it ""easy"" to gain height or climb the side of a wall). And for all people that buy the game; please play with the game for a while. At first I did not find it impressive, but then I watched gameplay and recognized the features this game has to offer. For example, I did not know that the sheild could be used as a throwing weapon, or that the sword could deflect bullets of the assault rifle.Update:Still reccomend this game, but please know, that this game will lag on lower end PCs, even at the lowest settings. The new 1.5 update is not really special, but it is a decent update. Also, motion blur is now an option."

Opened the game, looked at the first map, still not impressed. I started to get the hang of it though, the wall jumping and running, throwing weapons and using gadgets and I can now say that its the best 3 buckaroos I've spent in a long while. The game only has 3 maps atm, with a couple of difficulties and modes, the best mode being endless  in which you fight wave after wave of enemies and collecting resuplies, which if you couldn't guess, resuply your gadgets, which there are a lot of, same with main weapons. For main weapons you can get things like a bow, sword, a shield and more. I would highly recommend it if you're looking to waste a few hours.EDIT: it now costs 6 buckaroos instead of 3, like I said"

Have fun avoiding that with your other nija weapons like the electric shock, dart, and ninja stars that follw people and kill them in one shot. Climb the ways, wall run, and more....Have vision that allows you to see all your enemies. Really well made for alpha. SO much potential"

I redownloaded the game, excited for more of the fun combat and received an Error, Game requires Microsoft C++ 2015 runtime to play (or something like that). I looked in my files and saw BOTH 64x and 86x Microsoft C++ 2015 installed. Puzzled I looked to the forums to see if anyone else has this problem, and found it as a bug with the game. After searching I found A developer respond to one with a supposed ""Fix"" to my problem, Delete both 64x and 84x from my files, and redownload (he/she provided a link to the downloads) and restart my computer, after doing exactly that. I launched the game again hoping It would be fixed, and I would be able to return painting the white walls with red sauce, and received the same dreadfull error that prevents me from this amazing game.I have no idea how to fix this, Ive tried updating my windows system, repeating the Developers instructions for the fix, verified the files, I've done everything but command god to fix my problem.

,Not Recommended,581630,32974476,Posted: 28 June,all,NateDogg,"The game is very innovative and interesting, but it's clearly missing something.Sometimes wiping out a whole room of people feels awesome, but other times it feels boring and unresponsive. Many times certain kills won't fire - like jumping on someone's head and breaking their back (♥♥♥♥ing gnarly idea) works, but many times it doesn't and you bounce off. Cool moves are few and far between, and are generally quite anti-climactic.I wish I could put more enemies on the map, or remove certain ones, like non-melee.Stealth is a very big feature of the game, but feels quite wonky. The NPCs are 100% blind unless it's right in front of them half of the time, but the other half of the time - they can see you with their backs turned, or through walls.Everything is really inconsistent. The devs are seriously on the right track, but the game simply isn't as action-packed as I thought it would be. I often find myself really hyped for a level, but the hype dies quickly as a certain kill doesn't work due to the game's mechanics, or when killing an entire level's worth of enemies feels so shockingly boring. I wish it were more hack-and-slashy.Parkour is also as inconsistent as combat. Sometimes jumps and lifts work, sometimes not. You can wall-run on this side of the wall, but notthisside. It feels like a 50/50 chance if I'm going to climb up a ledge or jump off of it and fall off of the building I've been spending 3 minutes trying to scale. Parkour is too slow and unresponsive. Imagine Mirror's Edge, but if you unbinded the Left, Right, Jump, and Backwards keys from your game, and could only play with one hand moving from mouse to keyboard.It's a fine game, but it's not for me. I'd probably reccomend it with its current price, but I can't really endorse it, as its luster wears off fast. If the mechanics improve though, I would certainly reccomend and endorse it.At the moment, though, it's not really fun enough to play regularly."

There are 4 maps (Manson, Atrium, City, Harbor) and they play the same. You can just run through the level and kill everyone in a massive rampage or you can do it stealthy. In my opinion stealth is not as much fun but thats just me.You also get to choose the gadgets you want to take with you, you have a lot of options here, for exmaple a silenced pistol, shurikens, sleep darts, homing shurikens, a drone and other things. In my opinion the only part of the game that brings a level of variety to the game. Beating the same level over and over again is not fun at all, but if you choose different gadgets before each run it's a bit more different than the last, still it doesn't make up for the lack of maps.As for Gamemodes, there are two at the moment. One where you can just run through as you please and one where you need to be stealthy or else it's a game over. Gamemodes that possibly could be added are some sort of time trial where you need to finish the map in a cetain time or some sort of parkour with the grappling hook (which is a gadget aswell).All in all it's a really fun game for an hour or two, something that you play when you wait for a friend to join your party so you can play another game, or when you just have 5 minutes before your mother calls you for dinner and you have to get up from your seat and go up the stairs because you live in the basement and are a twenty year old virgin living at your mum's house.I gief: 4/10 rare pepes, would not play again until they fix the crashes and add some content."

This game is good, damn good. It's an early access alpha and for me it really shows. The game controls well enough, and the physics is alright, but the A.I is all things considered pretty shabby.I thought it was quite neat at first that the A.I do actually notice unattended weapons, as well as blood stains, and the sudden lack of other guards in that area.Though at times, their ability to actually see and hear can fluctuate wildly. Even when not on a ""cautious"" state, some of these guys can still see across the map and identify you as a threat almost immediately, especially noticable with the Harbour stage.Same with the hearing, at times I can fire off a loud♥♥♥♥♥gun, and only about 3 people on the map will hear it. Other times you can break a window and everyone on the map is immediately alerted to your exact position even if you've moved from the spot where you broke the window.Ninja mode I don't recommend, at all. I understand and am aware that it's a very hard mode and was intentionally designed that way, but the issue here is no ability to lure enemies with sound, as they'd immediately turn cautious, ending your game. Even if it was a inconspicuous sound, such as a physical object making contact with a wall.All in all, I recommend it however. Especially considering the up and coming workshop community, the recently released level editor is being put to some amazing use by the community, and I think you should check it out."

Levels don't have a huge ammount of intricacy to them either. Guns are inexplicably innacurate at times and won't hit someone at an arms length. Same with swords.

It lacks character and is an awful mess to play, it's even frustrating to pick up and change weapons, you only get 30 bullets in a smg and can't pick up mags, so you're forced to try awkwardly pick up more smgs or shotguns from fallen enemies (By the way, that's it, only smg shotgun or katana, that's 3 weapons) and no, you don't replenish ammo or gain mags from running over a weapon, leaping off high buildings won't damage you.PRO:I got it for the price of a medium pint of beer."

,Not Recommended,581630,33507734,Posted: 13 July,all,Oh Cock,"DISCLAIMER: steam somehow glitched and reset my first session of 44 minutes to 0, I went bakc to complete the maze like harbor level, in 3 minutes after a couple tries.I love stealth, I had to give this a chance, it wasn't even given a discount on the summer sale(one of it's few showings of arrogance) but I bought it anyways. The experience is simply lacking in multiple ways and the gameplay isn't good enough to salvage it to the point I wouldn't pay money to play or support the dev. Play csgo, it has the same level of stealth and variety(more replayability). Or play mark of the ninja(SAME PRICE ON SALE) which has actual fun nice stealth.PERFORMANCE & QUALITY OF LIFE:I'll go over this fast, you can't adjust sensitivity when you're actually playing, zooming in lowers it with no option to turn this feature off, the max graphical settings are hilariously labeled ""unbelievable"", it has huge screen tearing even on a ryzen 5 1400. There is no vsync option and it doesn't allow me to gpu-lock it into 60 because it isn't seen in my settings. Also the english is ok but flawed to the point thet you can notice. The game also requires you to bring up a menu to switch from your gadgets to main weapon, everything but your main gun has a hotkey. There is an again button on loss, this puts you in the area you died in but the rest of the level resets, boning you. There are no checkpoints and that again button is purposeless.GAMEPLAY 1: GUNSBullets have a very slow travel speed(nerf dart level), this makes guns severely bad feeling to use, moving targets, especially when they are roaming are unpreditcable and your tracers are too tiny to correct yourself with. you are better off spraying most non-stationary targets.GAMEPLAY 2: AIThe AI is bad. they act like cyborgs, where after the game goes into cautious mode for once, they will spot the inch of you that pokes out from a dark window while you're soo far away. However if you show yourself and get lost, they usually will go back to their patrol route after clearly seeing you run in the other direction. They do not even try to shoot you from distances, so for example in that window situation, they won't go there after seeing you there. There is also the status issue, you can't kill one before he alerts others if you are detected by him/them, there is no alarm systeam, everyone goes on cautious on one seeing anything, instantly.GAMPELAY 3: BALANCINGThere is no reward for being silent or not being detected, the game is super easy when you play it as a call of duty and basically impossible to go fully undetected in and very close to that to never go over cautious. I love going silent, but say the first arena has one side that leads to a wide open garden and another which has two guards and one watching them from behind. You can dismiss the two but their corpses are seen and you the enemy state goes to cautious, there is almost no way to get through without getting them to cautious which wouldn't be a problem, technically you are still not detected, but the game considers the cautious state to be detected when you are playing ninja mode, which basically mean ninja mode is nigh impossible, and there is no gamemode that only fails when you are fully detected. There is spotting but no proper vantage points, you never know if a guard will walk behind you unless if you go in memorizing the level.GAMEPLAY 4: Replayability.There is normal, ninja and survival modes. survival is boring and literally nothing but a bad survival shooter mode, ninja, as mentioned above is too challenging, the stakes are too high with no checkpoints and it doesn't even feel fair and go by it's own rules. Normal mode on hard difficulty is a bit more fun and requires stealth, but your best bet is still the assault rifle and pistol, both with extra ammo. And the glaring AI issues and performance issues and flimsy gunplay put that into mediocre level fun. There is no replayability due to lack of viability of actual ninja/mgs style stealth, the stealth here feels more like csgo. I could finish this game before my 2 hour refund period ends and not want to play anything of it again.The game in it's current state has everything that is included in it in a state that is flawed from the roots. You set up the base gameplay before anything and this game misses the point on all cornerstones of an fps or stealth action game, since this base isn't there, the rest of the game(which is just as half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doesn't become tolerable, even if it were , wouldn't matter due to the basic gameplay being plain out bad feeling."

The first problem I have is that the AI is as dumb as a brain dead worm. You have to ♥♥♥♥ing lick their face to get them to attack you. The second probem I have and probably the biggest problem is the ♥♥♥♥ing hit detection. MY GOD IT IS SO ♥♥♥♥ING BAD YOU CAN UNLOAD A WHOLE GODDAMN CLIP INTO THE ENEMY'S HEAD AND THEY WON'T ♥♥♥♥ING DIE. IT MAKES ME WANT TO UNLOAD A CLIP INTO THE HEAD OF THE ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WHO PUT THIS GODDAMN HIT DETECTION INTO THIS GOD FORSAKEN GAME. The third and final problem with this game is the fact that the enemies can spot you though walls. This one is makes the ninja difficulty about as painfull as shoving 20 bullet ants in your urethra all at once. But the game is still in alpha at the time if this review and I hope all of these things get fixed later on.

I wanna be able to use the hookshot with the sword and not have to clunkily switch back and forth.Second, add a little bullet time, not much.. but during multikills would be nice... or make a mode where time slows down the more kills you string together, and then speeds back up when you do not kill after a couple seconds.Third but definitely not least: please, please, please add screen brightness/ contrast as an option.. this game is KILLING my eyes... but I love it.tl;drQuality of life improvements:wallrunning/climbing improvements? maybe I'm not doing it right??screen brightnessFPS unlocker/overlayhotkeysOverall opinion of this game:The sauce is so beautiful.Whoever's idea it was to stuff little stick figures full of pizza sauce, you are a genius.Might as well call this game ""Painting with Sauce"".

The AI is only broken if you think the enemies know that it is YOU killing their friends. THEY DO NOT, despite you being the only red creature for miles. The fact that this game just got an update, with better performance (at least, for me), a new weapon, a new map, a new tutorial, I can see the bullets now, shoutgun from the start, more ammo for the new weapon and shotgun (as a gadget), helps a great bunch. The AI is still broken, but a LOT less so, and in a more fun way too. PLus, if you buy this game, the guy(s?) working on it get cash, so they make more updates like this one, so it becomes better, so it becomes more expensive, so I can laugh at my friends for not having enough faith in it.Some ideas I have for this game are as follows:Noew Map: ForestNew Gadget: SlomoNew Gamemode: Wave SurvivalAnd I'll edit this post if I have any more ideas"

It is doable but you will probably spend a good 15 minutes planning what you have to do step by step, and then your plan goes downhill because of one small blood spot you left over because the Mop is really bad.All in all this game is worth the 3$ and I would even say its worth more.If you are looking to get a cool short timed action game then you should defenitly check this game out."

Theres quite a lot to do in what little content it has, it all feels very fun, and its actually quite challenging. Of course it has its bugs, but you can forgive these.Theres one bug however that I do struggle to forgive, because it goes beyond the same. Sometimes, this game will do more than crash, it will crash your PC, forcing you to restart. To me, any game that causes this isnt ready for sale, early access or not.Its a shame as well, because I use this PC for more than games, so its now a genuine risk to play. I want to play it, but I cant, because I dont want to lose my work.EDIT: I forgot to say also, its pretty poorly optimised. Its a low poly game so it shouldnt be that taxing. My framerate doesnt dip but I do hear my fans shoot up whenever I run the gameEDIT2: Update again. Pretty much as soon as I finished this review, I went in for another go. So far I;ve been playing it everyday (its a really good game when your watching a movie on a second monitor, you can just jump in jump out which is really nice).

I guess it IS an early access title, after all.The movement system is quick and fluid, combat feels fun, and for an early access title, I haven't yet encountered any bugs in almost an hour playtime. It is an absolutely satisfying game to play when you figure your way around it.That being said, optimization could use some improvements (my framerate was almost halved on the Atrium map, as well as some sections of the tutorial, and I'm not too sure why), and, as I said, the lack of content makes the game feel monotonous after too long. Even the soundtrack started feeling dull, being the same two songs for every level.Hopefully we get some new additional content soon, because I really do love this game. For now, though?

I know that is a very nit-picky thing to say, but it has thrown me off and got me killed many times.When using the silenced pistol (and possibly other guns) the shots sometimes do not hit the enemies, even after a headshot.Apart from these tiny problems, I love this game and would definately recommend it, especially at its low price.Well done Diatomic Games!"

The game isn't a buggy pile of **** unlike most other early access games. Its a short game but you can spend hours on it and still not get bored. The weapons are fluid and fun (except for the shotgun imo) you can tackle the levels anyway you want and you're basically a ninja. I have ran on walls while shield bashing people, I have killed dozens of people with the exo knife throat-slit, I have sucked multiple enemies into a black hole on multiple ocassions, I have sniped my enemies from afar and watched as their heads exploded, and the sword throws.... my god the sword throws. It is a small game but the developer is adding even more pretty much bug free contt. Get it now before it gets into beta and the developer raises the price because my goodness this game is a gem it is only going to get better.

I had some seen some footage here and there on YouTube, but it didn't seem very interesting.I saw it on the Steam Summer Sale, and decided to grab it. It turned out to be one of my most favorite games of all time. You can hop in, play a few rounds, and hop off.The graphics are suprisingly nice, which makes sense because it was made in the Unreal Engine, and the combat gameplay is extremely fun. You can use tactics to be stealthy, or just rush around dodging bullets and slashing enemy swordsmen.ProsConsextremely fun gameplaylacking in content; gets repetitive quicklyvery nice graphics engine. shadows and lighting are expectional.low poly meshes and texturesOverall:8/10The only downside to this game is the lack of content.

76561198039604479,Recommended,581630,29944591,Posted: 15 February,all,The Sodden Squire,"Sword with Sauce is a early access indie action stealth game developed by Diatomic Studios about a red guy killing black guys across three maps and three game modes (so basically SUPERHOT in reverse, har har). Maybe you're thinking ""that's all?"".Yes it is, but there's three reasons whyYOUSHOULD BUYTHIS GAMEFirst: the addictive gameplay.This game makes you feel like A GOD DAMN NINJA. Your character, while being really fragile (evened out by regenarating health) moves like a parkour champion- you can wall run, wall jump, climb to higher platforms, YOU NAME IT.This agility is complimented by an arsenal of gadgets: you have your standart ""throw it and it kills people"" gadgets like shuriken, sleeping ""coma"" darts, grenades (explode on impact, so don't get too happy with them) poisonous gas grenades etc., but also a few gadgets that can help you detect your enemies, and last, but certainly not least, a few gadgets for expanding your mobility, for example, the grappling hook, AKA the best gadget in the game (seriously it never leaves my arsenal).Then there are the four main weapons you can choose on from to start with (+shotgun, but you have to take it from a dead corpse): the titular Sword, the Bow (you have to waste a slot in your inventory for a quiver with arrows though), the obligatory Assault rifle, and a FREAKING CAPTAIN AMERICA SHIELD. All of these weapons have their ups and downs, and all of them are fun to use (especially the Bow, the Sword and the Shield)Another awesome thing is its aproach. Yes you can be stealthy, but you can also go in guns blazing, arrows flying, swords clashing, and both of the aproaches are balanced out to the point where I can safely say that both are equally difficult and challenging, enough to not be easy (even now I still can't finish a level without dying), but not too much to be frustrating.And if you get to the point were you think it IS easy, then there's the two other modes, the ninja mode (don't let enemies know you're there. Literally. As in, IF A GUY FINDS A CORPSE, IT'S GAME OVER) and the survival mode (classic waves of enemies mode), that you can try out.Second: it's in its Alpha stage.This game is in its earliest stages right now. If you get it, you can try getting your own suggestions to the developers in the discussion section, and can take part in creating a great experience for you, and others, to enjoy. So jump on now, so that you won't be frustrated later with changes you don't like!Third: IT'S F.UCKING THREE BUCKS ON STEAM. YOU WASTED MONEY ON STUPIDER S.HIT THAN THIS.As for negatives:I myself have not encountered any game crashing bugs during my playthrough. When you die in water and click the button to respawn in the same place, it LITERALLY places you above the water you drowned in, but that's basic logic. Devs however, should they ever read this review, could change it so that you respawn to the closest place where it's safe.As for enemy AI, well... it's a little dumb, as losing you from their sights can result in them to start searching for you, something that you can achieve by simply circling around them. I however find it hilarious and it reminds of Jackie Chan moments when Jackie's behind an enemy and just keeps moving so that he doesn't get spotted.So in conclusion, SWS is a badass, cheap (not in a bad way) and fun game that you should get now, while it's still in its Alpha stage.Swords With Sauce 10/10"

You can throw a body off a lower platform (like the deck of the boat) but you can't throw them off the story above that deck level. The body freezes in mid-air or it just hits an invisible wall. On the harbor level you can autojump over the railing like it's a stair.Love the idea of different enemy types, like different health levels, or size, or potentially add some enemy wielded giant machinery on a harder mode.More explanation on how to switch between gadget and weapon during the tutorial would be helpful, sorta died a few times before I read the small print at one point and figured out how to switch.Some new gadget ideas could be extra ammo on the darts, blackholes, grenades, spinning deaths, and shurikens. Or potentially adding another weapon like a machete or two short knives.

I really like the concept of having a quick FPS with stickmen, giving you a false sense of easyness but actualy being quite challenging. The game is well thought out with somewhat inteligent ai that when they group up on you you have a tought time getting out. The only changes i would like to see are: balance out the weapons (ex. rifle is op), change the gadget system (ex. you can choose max 3 gadget per game and make them a bit stronger and they could be obtained by completing challenges). Features you should add: multiplayer, weapon upgrades, more setting (ex 4k support, windowed mode...), more maps and modes and special abilites!! All in all a fantastic game, 100% worth the money but tbh i would pay even 10-15$ on this game!! Keep up the work"

There are so many options to have fun with from weapon customisability to the way you play the game, and it's all for only three dollars!! A youtuber named BulletBarry gave a positive review for this game which I assume they saw because they added a FOV slider, which is something he is always critical about, what I am saying here is that they are consumer friendly and listen to the players, and this is a huge plus.

A refreshing change in my opinion, most games just give you a gun and a sprint key. Then you just run into people and hope you can get your gun up in time.But SWS gives a bunch of gadgets that would make james bond jealous, A few parkour tricks like wall running/jumping, A small yet deadly arsenal and says:""You see that map full of enemies?

I would like to see a little more variety in the way the enemies act and how they intereact around the world.They way that the alerts and things like that work i find to be odd, instead of being notcied by one person and have the entire base go on alert, it should behave like the way it does it metal gear solid where the enemy has to in some way contact another enemy npc to go into alertOther than that this game has huge pottential and i want to see what the developers do with it."

It has 4 weapons, over 30 gadgets, and supports a lot of different playstyles.This game has 3 different modes.Normal, where the goal is to kill 30+ enemies scattered around the map.Ninja, where you have to kill everybody without being detected.And Survival, where you kill endless waves of enemies.The gamemodes are generally decent, except for ninja, which is nearly impossible.There are only 4 maps, but they are all feel very well built and polished, with each being difficult in their own aspects. Some are very open, leaving you prone to sniper attacks if you're not careful, or smaller maps with tight enclosed spaces full of enemies.The four maps that are currently in the game are:Mansion, which is a map focused around a mansion. Lots of tight enclosed spaces, very difficult. If you want a very challenging and difficult map, i'd recommend this map.Harbor, which is a very open and absolutely huge map featuring a ship, with a tower for snipers and tight hallways, while at the same time being very open. It also features a dock, a giant flat plane covered in tons of shipping containers, perfect for sniping off of and wallrunning. Definitely one of the better maps, definitely best played with a run and gun type of loadout.City, which combines both tight staircases and corridors with open streets and bridges. The map is covered with tall towers, full of staircases and full of dozens of rooms full of enemies.Connecting these towers are bridges, with enemies patrolling them. If you go down to the bottom, you will be at the city streets, full of many enemies. This map works with basically any playstyle because of how many options there are for stealth, or running around, using your grappling hook to get between spaces, and shooting people as you fly above them. Probably the best map in the game.Atrium, which is a bit like city, but in the sky. You could easily fall off the map with a faulty jump. This map is a bit like city, but more compact. Enemies around every corner, you best be careful if you don't want to die. Definitely one of the more difficult maps, but very fun.Unlike some others, i generally enjoy the gunplay. Flying around a map with a shotgun and a grappling, for me, is one of the more fun parts of the game, and Generally pretty amazing.there are 7 weapons: the bow, the rifle, the pistol, the shield, the sword, the sniper, and the shotgun. I won't be going into detail with most of the weapons, but the shield needs a bit of an explanation.The shield is a very fun and unique weapon. if you block with it, you can deflect bullets and send them flying back at the enemy. You can also throw it, and it will hit all of the enemies in the vicinity, then fly back to you. It's basically Captain America's shield.Now, what makes this game different from others is it's gadget system. Not only do you get to coose your weapon, but also a selection of up to 10 gadgets at once. Overall, there are 30+ gadgets, which makes all the different kinds of playstyles possible. A very unique and fun system.TL:DR/Conclusion:Sword with sauce is an open world game with elements of parkour, stealth, and gun gameplay. The assortment of gadgets, weapons, and maps makes it stand out and make it much more fun than other stealth games. Definitely worth your $3."

As for the gameplay I like that there are different ways to play the game, you can run and gun or go with a more steathy approach. Or you could even mix the two. This game does get repetitive after playing it for a while but all I usually  have to do is switch up the map and my weapons to make the game feel fresh. I can see that in the future the game might get too repetitive and I might have to stop playing and wait for new maps or gadgets to come out before I start to play again. I think this issue could be solved with one or more multiplayer game modes that could help the game have a lot of replayability. One idea is a deathmatch gamemode where you could go around fighting the other players. I think that the players would have maybe 2 or 3 times the health or the usual enemies. But that is just of many things I could see added to this game. I do see a lot of potential for this game and I do hope that the devs  continue to add to it."

My personal favorite is the shield. Not only that but there is fluent parkour. 9/10Music: In my opinion it pumps adrenaline in your veins and makes you feel awesome. 8/10Replayability: There are many levels and gamemodes with different ways of doing them. 10/10Conclusion: I know this is a game worth like the 3 dollars and gives you a good amount of fun. 9/10.

It gives you options, which is what makes a good game a great game.You have a plethora of gadgets and weapons at your disposal to use however you please. You can go stealth, or run through with your sword. It's extremely satisfiying to electrecute 2 men in a room, stealth kill a few guys in a balcony, and then throw your sword at an enemy rushing at you. There are pretty much an infinite amount of ways to complete one level.This isn't one of those games that are easy on hard mode. If you really want a challenge, this game will give it to you. Even medium can be challenging based on your playstyle.The parkour, animations, and art design are very nice, and well implemented.As always, no game is perfect, and this one definitely has noticeable flaws. I won't let the game go just because it's in early access, because a lot of games never leave early access.The game is poorly optimized. You can still get over 60FPS with relative ease, but the simplistic art style should not yield as many FPS drops as I experienced.The maps in the game are all very intelligently made, and fun to play in, but there aren't enough of them.This game has a ton of potential. If you want more information on this game, ""Bullet Barry"" has a great video on it.Overall, it's a super fun game, and you can get a ton of hours out of it, considering it's only $3."

All of the customization options  and gadgets means you can tailor your character to your style, but in this lies a few of the major flaws. The hit boxes for enemies when they are in motion are practically non-existant, god forbid you are trying to use the bow for stealth. The sword seems to be the overall OP weapon, but close combat with other swords makes no sense as half of your hits are inexplicably not landing. Once the AI is in motion, you are hellbent to hit them in the right spot with any weapon. I appreciate what you're getting for the price, but for a game about combat, your ability to fight back is often extremely limited."

The game is fun to play, with several levels, different game modes, and a ton of interesting gadgets. You feel like an action hero, from James Bond to Captain America.Playing through the stealth is fun, the enemies have set patterns, and while they aren't smart they certainly aren't stupid either. With all the gadgets it becomes incredibly entertaining. I managed to take out a couple of guards on a balcony by throwing a boomerang as I lept through the air, as I hit te ground it landed in my hand, and both guards were down. Shooting about the level on a grappling hook, with nobody knowing where this ninja is. It's a beautiful feeling.The action is also very fun, as my mention of captain america may give away I really like the shield. If used right you can throw it into a crowd, watch as it bounces from enemy to enemy, and then comes right back. the other weapons are good too, and since it isn't easy to get that perfect shield throw I often find myself punching down an enemy, grabbing his weapon, and using that until I can get my shield back. the fluidity of launching a shield, grabbing a machine gun midair, and mowing down the ones still standing is great.This is a good point to mention the differnt game modes, there are three.Normal mode is, surprisingly enough, normal. It starts you undetected, you can try to complete the mission using stealth, but if you're detected you can start fighting them off.Ninja mode is, in my experience, nigh impossible. It requires you're really good at the stealth, and don't even let blood or weapons be seen by other enemies. If you're actually good at stealth this will likely be a great test, if you're not it's just frustrating.Survivor mode is just constantly spawning enemies, try to kill as many as you can without dying. It can be a big challenge on smaller maps, and is where most of the epic action scenes will take place. There are hordes of enemies when you get farther in, and with pretty frequent resupplies you'll be able to use all your cool toys.The best part of the game modes is that they show the devs know what the game is about. Normal mode is the basic game, play it how you like; ninja is for the stealth part, really fun, really challenging; survivor is for the action part, fight off loads of enemies while being as awesome as possible.As one should with early access I'm not going to judge this on what might be, and I'd say there's enough here to warrant $3. It's the price of a large coffee, and I'll enjoy this game a lot more than a coffee. As for dreams of what the game could be I think it'd be quite interesting if the grappling hook could do more, like ripping a weapon from an enemy's hands, or grabbing a weapon that you threw."

,Recommended,581630,32813521,Posted: 26 June,all,Freker,"Become a Badass Ninja-AssassinThis is a pretty cool game in really early stages reminiscent of the the quick violence weapon grabbing of the Madness Combat Interactive game, the stealth and use of gadgets of Tenchu amd the kind of level design of Hotline Miami, but rendered in 3D, with the low-fi visual look of Superhot. I know that's an awful lot of games to take from, but it works.First of all, don't dive in the game like I did without the tutorial. The tutorial is reccomended to act like a true baddass ninja-assassin, you can wallrun, wall jump and use a grappling hook, lay down traps for enemies to walk into or activate. In this game you can slice enemies in one swoop, stealthily slice their neck from behind them and throw your sword as a melee ala Hotline Miami and the ability to pick up guns whcih can be used in ironsights from slayed enemies with the remaining bullets left in the clip. not to mention the use of a quick gadget weapon wheel.The combat in the game can be crouching, sneaking or sprinting up to enemies gung ho whilst parrying sword strakes and deflecting bullets, how you tackle the level is entirely up to you. Make use of wallrunning and leaping to platforms at the end. This makes you feel like a true badass Ninja-Assassin. A great little time waster for that bout of wanted visceral, sneaky violence.There are only a handful of levels and a survival mode which can be turned on for each, but each playthrough will be something different depending how you tackle taking out the guards.For this game to be in alpha and so stylish and addictive already is nothing short of amazing, especially for a one man project, I simply can't wait for the game to be updated over time."

Anyway, SWS offers fast pased action in a veriety of modes. Ninja mode (Kill everyone without being seen)  'normal' mode (Just kill everyone) and survival mode (God help you). The tactics you can employ are vast and due to many combos regarding weapons and gadgets, the tactics never end. The game runs great and is a steal at £1.99.I hope they add a form of multiplayer, and as others have said, steam workshop content for new maps. I would personally love to see an in game level designer so the less tech-savy can still create their own levels. Also, if like me, your trust for alpha games has been shattered into dust, have no fear; SWS seems like it's a game that delivers wha it promises."

The game is in a VERY early alpha state, and, from the looks of it, the number of goodies we get to put our grubby little paws on is subject to change. The weaponry is fun and satisfying to use, my favourite being the Genji-flavoured Katana which can block bullets and the Captain America-flavoured shield you can bash enemies with or use to dent create sizeable dents in your opponents skull, depending on whether or not you toss it into their teeth using the wonderful R key. The R key lets you throw any weapon you have at enemies, yielding satisfying results. Especially with the shield. ♥♥♥♥in' love the shield.SUPERNOTThe game feels a hell of a lot like a fast-motion version of the game Superhot, which features very similar mechanics.

Luckily enough for us savages, the game provides plenty of enemies for you to maim.

It is simple to understand but difficult to complete levels on normal. You can create your own play style which is another plus. For a game so new it is fantastic.

(although I'm so cheap, I got it for free)I'm not very good at picking out every little detail, but I'll try to make this a decent review.Some of the good things: It has distinct weapons, with more on their way. The maps are all pretty different, even though there are only three. There are twenty gadgets to choose from, and you get I think 6 slots, (I could be wrong on that) making it easy to make each playthrough unique. The combat with each weapon feels pretty satisfying (bashing people with a shield and sending them flying in particular for me). Ok, on to the bad stuff: The AI is weird, but they're good enough to make the game challenging. (That's all I got in this department) And now some stuff I'd really like to see: A new user interface would be cool, but all the other stuff I want to list is supposed to be coming at some point soon so that's about it. (Also there are 3 different game modes, one is basically where you have to clear one of the maps with around 30 enemies undetected, one is where you just have to clear a map however you want, and one is where you have to kill a certain amount of enemies before you can get new supplies for each of your gadgets, while new enemies respawn. Any of these game modes can be played on any of the three maps)Tl;drI recommend it. It's a cool game."

Few things I would change in terms of design, I'm unsure as to the nationality of the developer, but in the gadget selection menu the english and grammar isn't the best it could be. The reaction times for some of the enemies is a little fast. For example, on the boat map I was having fun doing stealth and picking off my enemies one by one with some of the many brilliantly thought-out and creative gadgets and the shield weapon (by far my favourite of the four currently available weapons), and I turned the corner and was immidiately blown to smitherines by a hostile with a shotgun. A moment of surprise would've allowed me to continue on my hilarious streak of assassination, but instead my 300 and something hours of csgo had obviously not been enough, as I was out-skilled in terms of reaction time by an AI. The many possibilities and outcomes in Sword With Sauce are brilliant, except for the above mentioned reaction time, the AI is near perfect for a game like this, all the nav-meshing and pathfinding works perfectly on levels such as city, which has a lot of verticality, so from a technical view-point, what has been created so far should be considered a great success. Gadgets are very creative and enjoyable to use. I totally understand this is an alpha, early-access, work-in-progress build of the game, but the four currently available weapons (the bow, the rifle, the shield and the sword) all get very boring and seem basic very quickly. In other words, can't wait for an update, I think Sword With Sauce has massive potential, and what exists so far has been extremely entertaining. :)"

Its a lot like superhot but withoud the tome moves with you mechanic and not overpriced. A few ideas for weapons: A crossbow (this would be a lot like the bow but you dont have to pull back); a baseball bat (this would be alot like the katana but instead of the ninja block it send enamy flying with its alt attack); knuckle dusters (they 2 hit enamy unlike the katana and shield but attacks a lot faster); a laser gun (this does low constand and hits instantly); flamethrower (this would be short ranges and can set enamies on fire but if shot at the floor temorary sets the floor on fire); A grenade launcher (this would fire impact grenade but wont take them up); rocket launcher (this would fire an imact grenade without takeing them up with no drop off and could have a gadget that turns them into heat seaking). A few gadget idea: Kevlar vest (this should allow you to take more damage); Medpak (this allows you to heal to full health instantly); Adrenaline (this should increase your speed and fist damage or temporary make you immune damage); Pistol or wrist crossbow (this would be a mix of my crossbow idea and the pistol); Molotov (This would be like the gas grenade but doesnt bounce); a regular grenade (it would be like a impact grenade but bounces); mini laser (this would be like my laser idea but weaker); a heat seaking mini rocket (its self explanitory); A rope ladder (place this on a ledge and it allows you to climb up and down); a rope quiver (you can shoot the arrow on a surface and it drops a rope to climb); a rope dart (this would do the damage of the shurikan but has infininate ammo and the range of the grapple hook).

It scratches that itch to be a gun slinging badass or a stealthy ninja/spy. It is just pure gameplay without any frills. On top of this, it is more like a sandbox then anything else. This game also nails its price point even a cent more would feel like it is not worth the amount of money it gives. 10/10 with no doubt in my mind.Scroll all the way down for cliffnotes of reviewAs for the creator(s) of this game:$3 per purches is not a whole lot in terms of revenue stream. so here is my suggestion. Always publish free updates with new content. But reserve some stuff for DLC priced at about 50 cent each with each pack filled with cool content but always put the good stuff in the base game for free. The DLC should be stuff that you want to by to enhance the expiriance, not be the expiriance itself. Google ""Oblivion Horse Armor DLC"" to see exactly how best to pubish your DLC.What is so great about this little Indie game is that fact that for a $3 expiriance you get a solid game that is worth $3 but is a good game. You guys NAILED this games pricepoint perfectly and if you want to Make more by the way of DLC do the same a reasonable amout of content for less then a dollar I say 50-75 cent because I picture one DLC pack having a 1-2 new maps and 2-3 gadgets. I would Definatly pay 50 cent for that but I feel like $1 is too much. its like if you see 0.99 it feels too much but 0.75 is not. Its like if you are buying something thats 300$ on ebay but the $5 shipping makes you question it all. I want to see this game last a while any y'all need money to do so.In Short:10/10 must buyworth $3extreemly little amount of bugs compared to other Early Acces games (I probably crash once every few hours)because of the nature of the game crashes don't make you that angry, you don't lose any meaningful progressIts like a blend of hitman, COD, Dishonored, and The Level flow of the oldschool Doom(as in you have to keep moving)"

Wielding a huge defensive measure that easily took up a third of my screen.Alright.  Snuck up to a dude wielding a shotgun, and with a satisfying smack, took him out of commi-Ah balls. Spotted by two idiots wielding katanas!Not really thinking, I threw the shield. What happened next, was that the shield bounced of the last dude, conked the other from behind and then smacked in another dude I didn't even see.After that, I played the rest of this level with the avengers soundtrack, seeing how many skulls I can jiggle with a single tactical shield throw.10/10 would Captain Amerininja again."

And 2) I've just been busy.Keep up the work my dude. This is all I've ever wanted to see in a game. An idea (interpret it however you want), try to add in some form of multiplayer, be it competitive for kills, a free for all, cooperative, etc. the game has lots of potential as I've said before. Some of the gadgets are a bit OP. For instance there should be a range circle to indicate effective range of things like gas&explosive. Along with that some form of marker to indicate trajectory of object being thrown. The Range of the electric... err... zap things, needs to be increased in terms of activation range.

,Recommended,581630,29853893,Posted: 11 February,all,TheMutantChicken,"first of all, this game is very worth 2 pounds and i would defenetly recomend getting it as it is so fun and never really gets boring. to prove it i got the game yesterday when im writing this review and i have played it for around six hours becouse you dont want to stop playing it once youve started playing it. this game makes you feel like a total badass ninja jumping around slicing and dicing with your sword or throwing lock on ninja stars at 20 incoming enimies. bt the game isn't super easy and can be really hard to survive for that long on survival but isn't to hard to make you frustrated. i'll love the game in the future when they add more content and will probably also be one of my favorite games if they add stuff like: A zombie mode, some sort of online or co-op so i can play it with my freinds, more cool gadgets, a campeign, a level editor and also the game really needs an fov slider. i highly recomend this game if you have £2 lying around and if any developers have read this please add some of the stuff i said before. bye"

,Recommended,581630,30026110,Posted: 18 February,all,Hexie Lambent,"I'd love to see this game grow.  It's already very entertaining in its framework.  Currently it's a bit of a playground, wherein you're given a simple objective of your choosing and you follow through with the dirty deed with the loadout of your choosing, and I quite love such a premise.  It silently encourages you to be creative and form your own challenges and provide your own style.Sure, you could creep around with a shield and be nigh-invulnerable to projectiles while eliminating all 35-some targets one by one with some of them taking care of themselves in the process, ooorrr you could anger a crowd by slicing two of them down with a sword, wall-running away just long enough to pull out your homing buzzsaws, charging back in to snatch up a fallen shotgun after a few saps have had their limbs removed, finishing off the others with a few good blasts of buckshot.The simple aesthetic works well, though refinement to animations, shading, and just a -little- bit of extra detailing on everything would be nice.  Sound design is tolerable, nothing fantastic.  The AI is... functional, if a bit predictable and unimpressive, particularly at longer ranges and around corners.  Other than a cheap looking menu and a bit of ""engrish"", not a lot else to complain about this early on besides a desire for more content, which was already stated as a goal.It is also currently 3 whole dollars.  Already worth the investment."

Similarly to SUPERHOT, this game makes you feel like a badass, but at the end you don't have that voice in the back of your mind going ""You only were able to do that because time was slow"". There are more cons in this list than pros, but that doesn't change my view on the game at all. The cons are little nit picks (Except the last one, Ninja Mode can go die in a fire) and the pros need to be said in a size 40 font, all caps, and bold.Pros- The parkour and movement feels really good (when it works)- It’s real perty and minimalist and I like that very much stick it in me right now please- The gadgets vary DRAMATICALLY, and just switching up your ""Loadout"" can really change the way the level plays out- The city and docks maps are really good, and if more levels were to be added to this game, they should resemble these and let the movement flourish, rather than hold it down like mansion does- I like murder?Cons (I'm aware it's in Early Access)- Very often I felt like the wall running and climbing were inconsistent, and I often jumped backwards into a sea of enemies rather than climbing up a ledge- The game talks about how many gadgets it has, and they aren't lying, they have a bunch. But some of them either feel useless or obligatory, turning that large library into a much smaller one. Like the pole arm things, in concept they are very cool, but they don't work very well and the rope does everything they are supposed to do and more.- The enemies can either be bullet sponges or pieces of glass, their health seems very inconsistent- Projectile hit detection seems a bit off, I often tried to throw a sword or shoot an enemy, and it would pass through them and they would completely ignore it. (Which may be where the enemy health inconsistency is coming from, but I don't know, I'm just a simple man with simple pleasures)- The AI are vegetables and don't feel like a challenge- Ninja mode is ♥♥♥♥ING IMPOSSIBLE ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?"

How so ? by taking away the more calculated  and puzzle like feel  created by its slow mo mechanics and various weapons scattered around the stage, and  instead giving you an entire arsenal  of weapons and gadgets to take out your targets any way you please,giving the player complete freedom.I enjoy this game and  think it has much potential though i do think it feels a bit empty. I think they should add more stages and more modes (e.g,story mode,time trial,challenge modes ,multiplayer modes etc.)  and of course more weapons and gadgets are also welcome.tl;drThis game is very fun and has some potential to become something great and i recommend giving it a try, but i wouldnt recommend buying it just yet, but instead wait till more content is added."

Very cheap at the moment and is worth supporting as it is in such an early stage of development yet you can get so much enjoyment out of it. The main bad thing about this game is the small amount of maps, however there are bound to be a lot more added in the future.PS: I recommend playing some fast paced music in the background and just charging around the map with a sword, it is just so much fun."

Original and fun- could be compared to Super Hot but I personally think it's better- and also this is dirt cheap( I think it's underpriced. Love the gadgets and the way you can traverse across the map so easily.Ps: Gadget idea; ""Hate Bomb."" A gas bomb that makes enemies attack each other. It'll be particulary good as enemies have different weapon types- just an idea. Also the bow is underpowered and should have more damage and range.If you are undecided this game has huge potential and is worth buying now to support its development. Occasionally crashes but can be easily overlooked- especially at this price.Looking forward to updates-and the gadget i mentioned-..."

This game proves that you dont need cutting edge graphics, people in mocap suits, or even a high end gaming rig. If you love mindless violence and pick up and play gamestyle then this game is for you. You get gagdets to help you along with a choice of a gun, sword, shield, or bow. Granted the guns dont work like you'd think but who needs guns when you can have a Sheild and pretend like your Captain America?The only negative parts of the game is the very limited choice of levels and gadgets. I got tired of the gadgets after the third plathrough of a level. But seeing as how this game is still in Early Access stages, theres hope for more levels and gadgets."

The gadgets are fun to play with but don't become an absolute necessary.  The three levels that are available for play each introduce a different kind of challenge.  The only negative is that the computer has a tendency to over group the enemies, dealing with a group of six guys with two shotguns is pretty much guaranteed death.

,Recommended,581630,31702188,Posted: 12 May,all,_PhoenixGaming1_,This is one of the best games i've played in a while it's amazing.------------------------------------------------------------------WAYS TO IMPROVE IT-1. It would be nice to have an objective or mission mode where you have something to collect having it spawn randomly around the map makes it so that you can keep replaying maybe have it in a cage or a safe and having to kill the person with the key.2. Also an online mode would be nice i've even thought of a mode you go 1v1 vs another player but you and the other player and all NPC's look the same one of you have to kill as many enemy's as you can while the other player try's to find and stop you there is alot of potential for this game3.It would be nice if there was a silencer gadget for guns of course not the shotgun but the sniper and rifil4.It would be nice if there was a way to unlock skins for guns be able to make your own5.It would also be amazing to be able to make and import maps to the game as someone who knows a bit about 3D modeling it would be nice for me to make my own maps and import them also that means that you the dev's can focus more time on the gameplay and less time on making maps.CON-No FOV SLIDEREDIT: FOV SLIDER ADDED.

As an aging gamer who is finding steam more and more the benefactor of his gaming hours as life: (Work, Women, Children) take what remaining time I have to dedicate to a beloved hobby that for the most part has kept me out of trouble during my younger days.I'm glad I purchased this little game. Tis a fun ""Captain America Simulator"" as others have called it. You are a red stick figure in a world of Black Stick Figures and you are not welcome. You are given a small variety of tools to do some killing with (Firearms, Shuriken) to compliment your chosen primary , the athletic ability of a parkour ninja high on PCP, and the life-bar of a healer class in most RPGS (lol). I choose the shield because it's fun to deflect bullets, time a throw just right and watch it ricochet off the wall and score me multi-kills. Just don't always expect it to return to you (although it can and does if you're able to make it happen)This game isn't pretty, but is gorgeous in it's simplicity. I hope they continue support for this game. You should try it out for it's current price. Don't injest this game for long periods of time and you'll have something enjoyable to play from time to time. Cheers."

The only problem that i have encountered so far that ruins the fun, is that the hit detection appears to be bit dodgy, and projectiles wont hit at close range or just pass straight through enemies.Three Examples:I was running from a mod of enemies with katanas, running at em head first, i whip out the pistol and unload 3 magazines at close range (less than a metre) and none of them affected the hordei was using the shield weapon, which bounces from enemy to enemy and kills them without leaving blood, so i throw it and it passes straight through the guard i aimed it at and smashes a window behind him alertign the whole house to my prescence. i may as well have shto the wall whith a sniper rifle.I was stood next to a bloke with a shotgun and i tried to melee him with the shield, but instead smashed the window behind him and got a face full of buckshot.Overall i would recommentd the game as although this small bug is irritating from time to time the whole of the rest of the game is fun in the hour or so ive played so far, and i believe that as its still in early access, the hit detection will be fixed or i will find out i have some odd glitch or bug, or that i am alternatively an idiot who just likes to type when he's bored so wrote a review of this game. this game is worth picking up due to the modest price tag and the amount of fun You or I will doubtlessly have."

76561198351338694,Recommended,581630,33524270,Posted: 13 July,all,ABoss,This is one of my favourite games right now it is the best. Some critics are though that the guns are basicly useless you cant reliable use them. Too many people get alerted and its hard to kill all of them without blowing youself up with a grenade. Also it would be cool to see a 3rd person view of the entire round to see what you did wrong or just see how awesome you look. But besides those this game is great keep it up!!

First of all the parkour system in this game definately has problems but for the most part is much better then any other parkour game. The gadgets are cool, but alot of them dont work. The maps are really good but they should add a difficulty level to each map so a new player doesn't pick the hardest map."

,Recommended,581630,33578843,Posted: 16 July,all,Kadorhal,"When I came in, between some of the reviews I read and various technical issues mentioned in discussions, I was expecting a middling-high possibility that I'd end up refunding it before I hit the two-hour mark. I ended up finding a new, welcome addition to my library when it turned out to be a cross between Superhot, Hitman, Far Cry 3, and a Captain America simulator where I can kill everyone by throwing a shield at them and having it bounce back into my hand or between two or three other guys.There's still a few gripes and nitpicks, though. It is Early Access, after all.- Enemies occasionally just refuse to take damage from projectiles at specific angles. (EDIT:Depends on the projectile, from what I've seen now. Thrown weapons are exempt, they always work how they're supposed to with one exception. Shuriken only rarely do so, and usually only when I'm really close to the enemy, so I'm assuming they're spawned out pretty far away from the character model. Sniper bullets are exempt, and assault rifle bullets usually are too, but shotgun pelletsalwaysmiss the first time and the silenced pistol may as well be loaded with 90% blanks.)- Possibly-related, after they've set for a couple seconds, bodies get rather picky about where exactly you need to point the cursor at to grab and drag them around; immediately after death I can grab them by the torso and fling them around where I need them, but after a little while I need to grab one specific ankle or wrist.-No official way (yet) to play in windowed mode, borderless or otherwise - alt-enter works for some people, me included, but a quick check through discussions reveals that for others it just causes the game to freak out and crash. Even when it does work, it still forces itself back into fullscreen when you go back to the main menu.Changed as of 2.0.0 on July 24th, 2017, as many resolution and fullscreen/windowed options as you'll ever need now.- Noticeable delay in repeatedly performing some actions like throwing out the grappling hook or trying to deflect bullets with the sword. Although, considering their delays are longer than those for stuff like throwing shuriken(which are mislabeled as throwing knives, incidentally), thismightbe intentional.- Even with the tutorial, some things are explained poorly or not at all; the biggest thing, for me, is that I didn't find any in-game mention that you can quickly switch between your weapon and your most recent gadget by tapping the gadget-wheel button.-EDIT:Atrium map is noticeably less optimized than the others. On relatively-high settings that I can flawlessly run Mansion, Harbor, City and Temple at, the Atrium turns into a chugging slideshow where enemies apparently see me through solid walls andallmy projectiles pass through enemies.Still, even in its current state this game is a lot more fun than I expected. And it's only three bucks, so you're not going to be hurting yourself to at least try it out."

You have been warned!GameplayThis game has currently 6 different primary, 25 gadgets, 5 maps and 3 diffirent gamemodes which are Normal, Ninja and Survivor. There is also a parkour system that I won't spoil for you, because this system is a lot of fun.Weapons:SwordExtremely common in stealth games, that can be used as a short range melee weapon. This weapon can be thrown and it can kill from any range, if it's lands. This weapon will leave bloodstain everywhere. You can also deflect (not reflect) enemy bullets is timed right by using right click (or Mouse2).ShieldThis weapon can be used as a short range melee weapon, which does less damage than sword, but with great knockback. This weapon can also be thrown like sword, but if it lands, it will bounce to closest enemy, but will not, if out of range. This can lead to extremely long chain reactions, that can kill a lot people, who are in one group. This weapon doesn't leave any bloodstains. You can also reflect (not deflect) enemy bullets by holding right click (or Mouse2). Bullets will towards the shooter and they will get damaged and even killed by this reflect. Using righ click can also block melee attacks from enemies.Firearms + BowThis includes Machine Gun, Sniper Rifle, Shotgun and Bow. You most likely know what these does. You can shoot from these and aim down sights. Simple really. But every single firearm will make a lot of loud noise and bloodstains so these are not the ""meta"" for stealth games. On the other hand, Bow doesn't make any noise, but it will make some bloodstains, but less than firearms. Bow requires a Quiver Gadget if you don't want to run out of arrows.Gadgets:This game has gadgets and every single one serves a different meaning. Some has limited ammo, some are reusable and some are passive effects. I won't include every single one of these gadgets, so you can experience by yourself but I'll only include these gadgets:CleanThis is a broom that you can clean bloodstain that got from your victims. More from bloodstain down below.PistolA ranged weapon with a suppressor on it. It's currently only firearm in the game that has suppressor on it.Pistol Ammo / Machine Gun Ammo / Shotgun ammo / Sniper AmmoThese things are passive gadgets that increses your total ammo in your firearms by 2 clips (Or by 12 shells in shotguns). But you don't get extra ammo if you just pick up the same weapon from another person. The only method to refill you passive ammo is to claim a crate drop in Survivor gamemode, more from that below.Quiver gadget behaves the same way as these, but Quiver contains 30 arrows.Gamemodes:NormalYour goal in Normal gamemode is to kill every single person you see. You can kill them with loud weapons from far away or you can stealth the game and kill everyone with swords, darts and shurikens. If you kill someone, you have to move the body to not get detected by other enemies as expect for a stealth game. But you have to also move his gun (But for someone, his gun will just disappears, if you wait long enough) and clean your victim's blood from surfaces. You can reduce the amount of bloodstains you have to clean by using non-lethal weapons or gadgets.If you get detected, enemies will try to hunt you down until you kill them or they kill you. If they don't see currently, they will be aware of you and they will search the place they saw you last time and be there until they see you again or they get killed. For some reason, if Enemy A detects you, but Enemy B doesn't, Enemy B is not aware you existence, even when Enemy A passes right though Enemy B.But your goal is to kill 30 enemies in any way possible.NinjaThis gamemode is same as Normal, but if you even get detected, it's a Game Over. This makes it impossible to kill with loud weapon. If you make any loud noise, even if they don't see you, it's a Game Over. They just have to be aware of you.Your goal is to kill 30 enemies without getting detected.SurvivorThis one is different from previous two mentioned. You will never win this gamemode, because it contains endless waves of enemies, who are always aware of you, but don't knwo where you are. If you kill 40 enemies, you will get a crate drop, which contains ammo to your weapon and to it's clip (Shotgun has shells in it's but it counts), to your gadgets, including ammo gadgets.Your goal in this gamemode is to kill as many enemies as you can.Custom gamemodeFrom update 2.0.0 onward, you can make your own gamemodes which has a lot of options to choose from. You can post these gamemodes to Workshop as well. I don't want to be here for another hour to write this review, so I'll let you explore those custom gamemode settings.StoryThis game doesn't have an story in it. But it's only Alpha version of it so we will see if developers are going to make one.MapsThere are 5 maps which are called Mansion, Harbour, City, Atrium and Temple. You can explore these anyway possible, but these maps are not so big, so this isn't a open world game.OnlineThis game doesn't a online feature, until now, developers annouced that they are going to make a multiplayer system. But for now, you can share your own gamemode to community via Steam Workshop and in the future also make your own maps and share those too with Map Editor. I'm really excited about these ones.ConclusionThis game has a lot of potential. Even tho it's only Alpha version of the game, it's a lot of fun for singleplayer. And developers said, that they are going to add multiplayer elements to it.If you're going to play multiplayer stealth games, it's basically Payday 2 stealth; when someone fails, everyone fails.But in the end,9/10 Need more sauce plz ;_;"

Updates are fairly regular, and the developer has ambitious plans for where the game's going. Currently there's 6 weapons and about 30ish gadgets, customizable games (wanna become invulned? Set enemy damages to insane levels? Make machine gun snipers? You can make that a game mode), and 5 maps. That said, I can only recommend: BUY THIS GAME.

,Recommended,581630,34088912,Posted: 7 August,all,NicBoy!,"This game has amazing potential, especially in a multiplayer setting. I love the way the movement feels, although I wish there was another dynamic (such as ledge-grabbing) to eliminate the feeling of spamming spacebar to climb up a building. Another thing I love is the wide selection of tools at your disposal to complete the mission. With tools such as a graapling hook, ninja stars, and THROWABLE BLACK HOLES, this game has an amazing variety of weapons that you can use to dismantle your opponents. Despite all of the pros, there are also cons to this game which are easily recognizable within the first few playthroughs. The UI in the game needs a bit of work. Most of the icons are low-quality, such as the weapon icons and interaction icons. However, this may be due to my resolution. Secondly, I noticed that movement feels sort of slow. It might just be me, as I am more accustomed to fast-paced action in parkour games. A few things that could improve the game are: a slow-motion tool/weapon, a quicker movement speed, better quality icons, and a few more mechanics to improve parkour.7/10"

,Recommended,581630,34988797,Posted: 15 September,all,sleepyjoe256,"This game. This game is fun as ♥♥♥♥ and I've hardly scratched the surface.Starting off, one is immediately reminded of SUPERHOT. Same blocky, featureless enemies, same angular, bland architecture. Thing is, that's about the only thing it has in common with SUPERHOT, besides the sheer fun of punching a guy to death, grabbing his sword, cutting down another guy who has a shotgun inches from your face, throwing your sword through the face of an enemy like 30 yards away, then grabbing the shotgun to pulverise theotherguy with the sword who tried to sneak up behind you. And yes, that's totally possible.Anywho. In SWS:A, you are tasked with killing abunch of black guysbunch of murderous mannequins who happen to be painted black. You play the part of a murderous mannequin that happens to be painted red. And that's the plot. The whole thing (It's still in alpha).Graphically, I already mentioned the similarities to SUPERHOT. I have no idea if the creator is planning to add any more polygons in the future, but personally I don't see the point. It's madcap murder at it's finest right now already, more polygons would be superfluous. There's a pleasing amount of blood spatter (and doesn't that phrase make me sound like a psychopath?), depending on your method of murder. Ventilate an enemy with a shotgun? Instant Jackson Pollock. Bludgeon him with Captain America's shield (Yes, it's an option)? Nary an errant drop to be found.The learning curve is kinda brutal if you don't take the tutorial. There's running, jumping and crouching of course, but there's also walljumping, wallrunning, and that thing where you hoist yourself over a ledge. There's also a plethora of gadgets, that include everything from a drone that allows you to mark enemies on the map from a safe and discreet distance, to what seems like a heat-seeking sawblade that you can toss in an enemy's general direction. It will soar through the air like a frisbee until it gets close enough, at which point it accelerates viciously into their squishy bits. It's extremely satisfying to use, and I've used it to take out snipers all the way across the map.There are several main weapons. Assault rifle, sniper rifle, shotgun, sword, silenced pistol, bow and arrow, and the SHIELD. Of all of them, they behave mostly like you'd expect, except the shield. If you've seen the Avengers movies, you're probably familiar with the way Cap A can throw his shield, knock out four dudes, and catch it on the rebound. Well, you can do it here too, and it's SO MUCH FUN. The first time I bounced the shield off a wall and knocked out a guy thatI didn't know was there, I squealed like a little girl. The first time I threw the shield and knocked out FIVE bad guys, I had to pause the game I was laughing so hard. This game is FUN.Unfortunately, the AI is, so far, garbage. The swordsmen run straight at you, and don't even try to block when you're throwing stuff at them. The riflemen and shotgunners don't react when you're blocking with your shield, to the point where the easiest way to kill them is to walk in to point-blank range, wait for them to fire, and ricochet the bullets back into their faces. The snipers hold stock still and pivot extremely slowly, so you can avoid them easily be zig-zagging.As I've already mentioned, the gameplay is FUN. For a game that cost less than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fast-food meal, it's given me a fair few hours of entertainment already. It's entirely skill-based, no leveling mechanics whatsoever.Wait, I'm supposed to do a music category. Well, I turned the music off in the options, so take that how you will.My Scores:Graphics:6/10Learning Curve:8/10AI:5/10Gameplay:10/10Music:3/10Overall:32/50Despite the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ overall score, this is an amazingly fun game. I definitely recommend it."

The strategies and game ideas are really endless and will be even greater when multiplayer and the level editor are added. You can go in run and gun style and get a machine gun, death stars and sticky bombs. If you want to go in all Splinter-Cell get a silenced pistol and the x-ray goggles. If you want to be like Tenchu, get a sword and go into the ""Temple"" map. You can also add gamemodes, you can have the enemies do more or less damage or have them be smater and more capable with their weapons.I've put so many hours into the game and haven't even touched the surface of what you can do in this game but I can give you a run down of the levels and all of the weapons.There are 5 levels at the time that I am writting this review, Mansion, Harbor, Temple, Atrium and City. Mansion is what you would expect, there are guards on the outside and inside and it is 2 storries. At the top of the staircase there is a sniper and a ton of other guards, it is one of the best maps. Harbor is my favorite, there is a ship and beside the ship is an  area with a ton of cargo boxes and that makes it perfect for stealth. Once you take everyone out on the ground, you have to go onto the ship. There are 2 snipers on the ship and it's also has 2 levels to it one sniper is one the 2nd level, aiming at the rest of the boat and the other one is at the stairs, staring down at the cargo area.

I'm mainly writing this review on the off chance that the dev sees it and takes the following suggestions to mind.With a sword being the main weapon of the game, MAYBE perhaps add a dynamic cutting system very similar to Shadow Warrior 2 and Metal Gear Rising. The simplistic character models make it an easier feat, and with this game currently being in alpha, it can be implimented in later versions. Or at least blood squirting mechanics identical to the one in Smod for firearms. Just a few suggestions that I think would make the game more satisfying and different at the cost and understandability of raising the price.But I still recommend this more than Superhot."

,Recommended,581630,34496639,Posted: 25 August,all,Robert Downy Syndrome,"Very fun and challenging game. Emphasis on CHALLENGING. normal mode is pretty easy, but once STEALTH mode is activated, this is the most complicated and challenging stealth game i've ever played. You have to be quiet, unseen, and literally leave no evidence that any of your opponents were killed. If a guard sees blood, bodies, or weapons, it's game over.There's a couple of things i'd like to see added to this game which would help make stealth mode more plausible (normal and endless modes are already great). Enemy detection should be toned down a bit. The marker that shows how close an enemy is to detecting you is great, but it doesn't help for when an enemy is about to see a dead body, a weapon, or blood on the ground. There should be more delay to how fast you lose after a guard discovers you. Perhaps maybe a sound could play or something to let you know when an enemy is about to detect you, so that you know you have to kill them quickly.A minimap would be great, allow the player to see where guards are on a minimap and what direction, and how far they are able to see. It's hard to tell how far away you have to be to be safe from detection.Guns are detectable from WAY too far away, specifically the sniper, which i would have assumed would be useful for stealth missions, however there is no way to use it without being detected unless you are very far away from all the enemies on the map. Perhaps add a silencer attachment that can be used to make it viable which takes up an additional tool slot?I'd love to see some more maps, like some outdoor/wilderness environments maybe? all the current maps have buildings ect... I'd also really like to see some sort of campaign or mission mode eventually, and i'm super excited to see what multiplayer is like when that comes around."

This game has modes also which is really fun there is a endless mode where enemies keeps spawning and you have to survive as long as you can. There is a ninja mode. You have to kill everybody without being detected.
