The visuals are better, the questions are better explained after you answer and the questions are better divided into groups as well. Just like the first game it's however a relaxing little game with cute graphics and filled with silly questions.This is a cheap title that is all about learning random facts. It's something relatively fun to do for a few hours and for the asking price I think its justified. Nice music, a set of achievement (with some nice icons to display on your profile) and it comes with trading cards also.I don't think you can go wrong with this game unless you want a difficult game or hate answering questions. I even learned some new things from playing so that's always good. This is a simple game to play while you are browsing the web or doing something else. It runs well and should work on most computers since it's not very demanding."
,Recommended,581760,29636581,Posted: 1 February,all,XJ9,The second game is a serious step forward:+Every question now explained once you answer - good!+Huge pile of questions now divided into small parts.+Visual part is improved as well.+Cheap and has cards.+Good looking achievement icons to decorate your profile.+Nice music.So after all its all around good game for a dollar. More enjoyable than the first one.

,Not Recommended,581760,30562601,Posted: 16 March,all,Easelm,"True or False 2 is all about answering the questions or statements correctly as possible. The game has a more evolved UI than True or False and it looks way better than the first game. They even have levels this time; However, I feel the look and more added questions/statements is the only thing good about this sequel, besides trading cards and achievements.True or False (first game), I had an issue with how terrible the true to false ratio was. I hoped they would learn to make an equal amount of true or false questions/statements, but they didn't. I tested this by selecting ""true"" on entire level(s). The results were disappointing. On pretty much all levels there's way more true questions/statements rather than a 50/50 true/false ratio. Another disappointment that both games currently have is none of the questions/statements are shuffled. You can memorize each level and that's honestly no fun. Lastly, the ridiculous part about True or False 2, the unusual questions/statements are 99% always true and too predictable even if you don't know the answer.To top everything off, as I was closing in to achieve the remaining achievements, I found out if you spam enter it will continue to select ""true"" on all the questions/statements. Not sure why enter is a bound key to begin with.Overall, as a game it's terribly coded, executed and logic is nonexistent. I guess that's what this game will always be because  it's free. The only thing I would recommend this game for is its trading cards and achievements. Otherwise, try to enjoy your free game."

This time it costs some money. Maybe the stunning facts for the true or false questions are hard to find. Or maybe some other bill has to be paid. The gameplay is simple as pie. Just decide oddly what you think is right. The questions don't appear random. They are one set of question-answer pairs. Just the 100 achievements popup in strange patterns.

,Recommended,581760,30978230,Posted: 6 April,all,Perfect 100 IQ Elite Kill Master,"ntroduction: Gandhiji was one of the greatest Indian of all time. He is called the “Father of the Indian Nation”. His original name was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. He was given the title of “Mahatma“, which implies “Great Soul“. People also call him “Bapu” affectionately.Early life: The birth of Mahatma Gandhi took place on 2nd day of October in 1869 at Porbandar (Gujarat). His father, Karamchand Gandhi, was a noble and pious man. Mr. Karamchand was the chief Dewan of the State of Rajkot.His mother, Putlibai, was a simple and religious lady. In his early age, Gandhiji was deeply influenced by the religious and pious behaviour of her mother.Gandhiji received his early education and training from such pious parents. He grew up to be deeply religious, truthful, honest, and fearless from his very boyhood. He was married to Kasturba Gandhi in 1983. The wedding took place according to traditional custom.As a child, he was a brilliant student. He completed his matriculation examination in 1887. After a brief study, he traveled to England to study barrister-in-law. In 1991, he became a barrister and returned back to home country.South Africa: At the age of 24, Mahatma Gandhi went to South Africa as a lawyer. He had spent twenty-one years at South Africa from 1893 to 1914. As a lawyer, he was mainly employed by Indians staying at South Africa. He found that Indians and other dark skinned people were the oppressed section of the society. He himself faced discrimination on several occasions. He was once disallowed to travel on first-class and thrown out of the train. He was moved by the poor condition of Indians and decided to fight against the injustice. In 1894, he formed the Indian Natal Congress to fight for the civil rights of the Indian community in South Africa.While at South Africa, he fought for the civil rights and privileges of the Indians living in South Africa. Throughout his struggle, he taught people to fight for their rights through non-violence. Hence, he made his mark as a great political leader in South Africa.India: He returned to India in 1915. Later, he was the president of Indian National Congress. He protested against the mis-rule of the British Government. He had been associated with several national movements during India’s struggle for independence such as Non-cooperation Movement in 1920, Satyagraha, Quit India Movement in 1942, etc. On several occasions, he was sent to prison. There was wide participation of women in the freedom movements led by Gandhi.Non-cooperation was his great weapon. The Non-cooperation Movement as a non-violent protest against the use of the British made goods by Indians. It was a movement of the masses of India.Salt Satyagraha or Dandi March was a protest against the tax regime of British in India. Gandhiji produced salt at Dandi without paying the salt tax. The Civil Disobediance Movement movement got support of millions of common people.Also read: Causes, Effects and Significance of Civil Disobedience Movement in IndiaIn 1942, Gandhi raised the ‘Quit India’ slogan. Gandhiji asked the British Government to “Quit India”.  The Quit India Movement was the most powerful movement launched by Gandhi to end the British rule in India. He gave the famous slogan of “Do or die” for the freedom of mother country.Principles: He followed the principles of non-violence, truth and peace throughout his life. He guided his fellow citizens to struggle for freedom, not by using weapons, but by following ahimsa (non-violence), peace (Shanti) and truth (Sayta). He proved that Ahimsa (non-violence) is more powerful than the sword. He adopted the principles of satyagraha in the Indian Independence movements.Gandhian era in Indian History: His remained the most influential leader of India’s freedom movement during the period from 1919 to 1948 and thus the period is called the ‘Gandhian Era’in Indian history.Importance: He is a well-known world personality. He shook off the British imperialism. The British were compelled to quit India. He secured freedom for our country following the principles of truth and non-violence. He was, thus, a saintly leader. Finally, India won its independence on 15th day of August in 1947.Gandhi Jayanti: In India, Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated every-year on the day of his birth-anniversary. It is a national holiday. The world celebrates 2nd October as the International day of non-violence.Death: Unfortunately, the great saint was assassinated by Nathuram Godse on 30th January, 1948.Conclusion: Thus, Mahatma Gandhi was both a saint and a practical leader of his compatriots. He was a simple, pure, unselfish and religious person. He did most of his personal jobs of his own. He fought for the freedom of India through non-violent and peaceful methods. He tried hard to raise the distressed sections of the society. He fought against illiteracy. He dreamt of providing mass employment through Charka and Khaddar. He always felt for the poor and untouchables people. He wanted to abolish untouchability from Indian society.The life and teachings of Mahatma Gandhi were so glorious that people around the world still pay homage to him. We will always remember his in our hearts."

,Not Recommended,581760,34874600,Posted: 10 September,all,lannpaige,"I picked up True or False 2 with the first game. I wasn't really expecting much from the titles. After playing the first one and being pretty disappointed with it, I thought the second one would make improvements. Unfortunately, that didn't happen.The goal of True or False 2 is simple. You're given a statement and you have to determine whether that statement is true or false. You select your answer with the mouse. In True or False 2, the questions are provided in nine different rounds. Rounds 1, 2, and 3 have 10 questions a piece. Rounds 4, 5, and 6 have 20 questions a piece. Rounds, 7 and 8 have 30 questions a piece. Then the 9th and last round has 40 questions. Answering certain questions correctly gets you achievements. There are 100 achievements to earn.Pros:- Simple, cute, and unique design.- Questions range from easy to difficult.- Rounds can be repeated if any questions are missed.- Many easy achievements for people who want to bulster their achievement count or perfection list.Cons:- The game takes less than an hour to beat (it only took me more than that because I had to step away from the game).- There is zero replayability.- Some questions from the first game are repeated in the second one.- There are no different modes, like the first game offers.The only improvements from the first game to the second is that the second game is cheaper overall, since some questions in the first game you have to buy DLC to obtain. That's not really that much of a plus though. Unless you're looking for easy achievements or something simple/quick to play, avoid this game."
