,Recommended,582500,29957031,Posted: 15 February,all,Ov3RT4K3R,"We were here is a free first person puzzle game, which is heavely focused on communication.The players are lost and separated in an abandoned castle set in a frozen wasteland. 1 person is the explorer and has to solve puzzles in time and the other person is the librarian who has to guide the explorer through the puzzles. Both players have to communicate over voice chat in order to solve the puzzles. Your goal is to find the way out in time.The game is very unique. The puzzles are challenging and requires you and your partner to put your heads together and actively communicate with each other.It is a fun and challenging game for a duration of approximately 1 hour.You should give it a try.Sounds 8/10Graphics 7/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA"

,Recommended,582500,29765329,Posted: 7 February,all,Charles 'Charlie' Charlington,"First of all, this game is F R E E. FREE..With that being said, I recommend this game to everyone I possibly can, the levels are really well done, and it has a really spooky-like atmosphere, I could swear whilst doing a puzzle, I saw some kind of figure move past me in the dark, or did I? I don't really know at this point, it was getting into my head, it left me scared at one point, afraid to go forward in case there was some kind of monster awaiting for me in the next room.This game is co-op and it requires voice comms to play, you could play it without voice comms but for the full effect, grab a mate and go through it with him.If I had to compare it to another game, I'd say Firewatch (although I never played firewatch first-hand), It has the same kind of art style and you also get to communicate with a *real* person through a walkie-talkie as well.Keep in mind before getting this game, the walkie-talkie function as I'm writing this review does NOT work, I'm not sure why but I ended up using push-to-talk on discord with my friend and we keybinded the button to also put out the walkie-talkie in-game, so same thing basically.And there are some slight bugs in the game, but luckily in our run, we had none at all.G E T.

,Recommended,582500,29810130,Posted: 9 February,all,Lin,"tl;dr: A free-to-play asymmetric co-op puzzle game that is worth wasting an hour or two with, even if you can't play it in VR.We Were Here doesn't really have any story, it simply puts you and your co-player in two different areas of a frozen castle and lets go of your hand. Which is perfectly fine. There is simply something enjoyable in having to exchange information with a friend in order to solve puzzles, no matter how easy or basic in their conception these puzzles may end up being. It's also entertaining to listen to a friend freaking out over seeing something mildly creepy, while all you're doing is patiently pressing levers in a completely different room with no idea what you're doing or what it is they're freaking out about.There were still some kinks the game hadn't ironed out yet at the time of writing. Most important ones: The ingame chat didn't work (we used steam chat to play instead) and I got stuck in location at some point, having to wait till I died to be able to restart the puzzle. And frankly it's not a particularly pretty game, in fact it feels like your standard unity game in a rather obvious way. But it does have some creepy moments here and there, and there is a segment in a frozen yard that was equal parts annoying and nicely immersive. I also laughed maniacly at the ending, for reasons I will not spoil for you.All in all, it's just plain ol' good fun, and the rough edges are forgiveable for a free game. So if you're still waiting forKeep Talking and Nobody Explodesto get a deeper discount, this game should help scratch a similar itch for free. Just find a buddy to play with, and make sure to set aside those 1-2 hours, because despite having checkpoints to allow for toilet breaks and drink refills, there is no real save system.Looking forward to more from these devs."

I played it with a friend, and had alot of fun working through communication problems and solving the puzzles.There is one major problem though.  And while it is an excusable problem because the game is free, it is still a problem.THE GAME IS SHORTEven with trouble solving some puzzles, I completed the game in an hour.  The ending was very abrupt, and almost feels forced.  As if the game should have gone on, but the developers didnt want to make more, so they tacked on an ending.All in all, it is still a good game and 100% worth playing.If the developers had to charge a little to make it longer, that would be perfectly fine.PSDEVS, PLEASE MAKE THIS A FULL GAME"

It offers an immersive atmosphere that expertly mixes puzzles, horror, and communication. The ending is one I will never forget, partly because of my friend's reaction.

76561198140123432,Recommended,582500,30127602,Posted: 23 February,all,crazy,"So I was looking for new game to play, to take a break from all my others, and I came across this little gem. I played through the game twice with my friend, (Once as explorer, once as librarian) and I have to say, it did not dissapoint. It is a breath of fresh air from conventional horror games, and although the visuals aren't all that scary, the puzzle element adds an extra layer on tension into the gameplay. Almost all of the game takes place in a dark, dingy castle, however, if you do decide to play this game, take time to stop and admire the art style (Just pick your moments wisely). I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game and will admit I got a little emotional at the end. This game definitely deserves a sequel or something similiar, maybe some DLC's. Even though the game is free, I would be more than happy to pay for it. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes the suspense or thrill of horror games, yet enjoys working alongside others to solve puzzles. The only thing I can critique is that it is very difficult to play without a friend, as there are not many cooprative people out there. Stunning game 9.0/10."

I was also really excited to try with a stranger. It worked great and we had a lot of laughs. I really loved when we started over, and switched roles.

,Recommended,582500,29712305,Posted: 4 February,all,Kaichou,"I enjoyed this. It wasn't RNG based puzzling, but it was a fun one-time play and maybe two times if you want all the acheivements. There was a part where my friend got stuck in a wall and I fell off the map ( at the ending area ) and that kind of sucked. We had to restart. Other than that, it was a fun short game.I'm writing this in hopes to support more.Try and put more randomized puzzles and close off clipping. I think a little more testing was needed. Interaction with some parts was kind of hard (small hit boxes). The colored levers and doors could literally be finished without the other person. Chess part has missing letters/cut off letters at the bottom. Not sure if intended, but would help with people not farmiliar with how to address the board."

The first time around it has a really creepy atmosphere, but playing it a second time as the other role, it loses its effect. A GREAT game. Short but amazing. The only thing is that the walkie talkies they provided in game didn't work. We were on discord with eachother though, so that was not an issue. Communication is an absolute must!"

,Recommended,582500,29682679,Posted: 3 February,all,Jim_Puff :^),"It's actually pretty cool, and it was fun figuring everything out, but as of now there are some bugs that are ruining the game and leaving a bad taste. Some of these include falling out of the world as Librarian, or a checkpoint never loading after a certain ""stage"" in the game, making us restart all our progress. A save feature would really be good to have, otherwise we're doing the same puzzles over and over just to solve one.Eventually it becomes super easy once you switch roles, as both sides understand the puzzles and the solutions are always the same, apart from maybe a few rune puzzles.It's got potential, but it's current state is a little wonky. The music is real good and the spooky puppet people freaked me out first time."

The puzzles were somewhat challenging and required you and your friend to put your heads together and activley communicate to get out of the mansion.

,Recommended,582500,29756222,Posted: 6 February,all,Demitri,"This game is absolutely amazing. It, by far, surpassed nearly all free games I've ever played, and a lot of the paid ones too! The incredible and genius communications-based puzzles and the beautiful art style and atmosphere really hit home its own ""adventure"" and medieval feeling. The tension some moments had were shocking and out of the blue, which really struck that bone of worry. The game, as buggy and hard to set up as it may be, is still one of the best original games I've played myself. It reminds me of Nancy Drew and Mist, along with other games with similar feelings, except this one, in my opinion, was the best out of them. A solid 8.5/10 for me.Pros:Great puzzles with challenge, but not impossible or extremely obscure.Beautiful and interesting art style and atmosphere.Original mechanic relying on two people and their communication, making it always interesting.Partially spooky at moments, keeping you on edge.Cons:Game has scattered bugs, particularly in the menu along with problems of some people not launching at all.Some physics and edges of the rooms clipped weirdly, or even led to falling out of the map.Two of the puzzles did not work 100% as intended, to a point where we had to look up the answer to one.Could use some optimization on the performance section."

After both players press ready the loading bar stops (Literally stops) at 75 or 80% and doesn't move. Looking at my task manager shows the game has a ""Not responding"" error which doesn't go away.Ouch.....2. The seeming majority of players are ones who speak any other language besides English that i cannot speak. This in turn makes it both difficult to understand when neither person can understand the other as well as making the whole ""Co-op"" thing rather pointless.I know that comes off as rather mean but for a game such as this it's utterly aggravating.Overall the best advice i can give is to play and judge for yourself."

,Recommended,582500,30097923,Posted: 22 February,all,Kat ♥,"*SPOILERS*Background theory:The King in the theatre lives in the castle you have been taken to. The King shows you in the theatre that it once was a king and a happy kingdom filled with life and joy which now is a wrecked down castle in the middle of a snowy nowhere. Where you can see portrait of the king in the library and on the windows. What me and my friends at first failed to see was that the king is showing you his backstory, making you(the player) play through his life story. He went mad and slaughtered his kingdom and the people in it. Standing proudly in blood and then in later years realised what he had done. He had murdered his wife. More proof of this is the film you find in the library about chess, where the king kills the farmer and then it cuts off. We do not know why it cuts off here, if it's him realising what he haad done or if theres no reason or it's just gives the player more reason to believe in the theatre. Questions asked would be; but why would he take so much effort in showing you all this and making puzzels for you and your ""partner"" to go through together? Well we came up with the idea that he makes you go through it all to become closer to this person as you solve the puzzle together which would replicate to him spending time with his wife. He even makes you both save your ""partners"" life at several occasions, as when he attempts to drown one of you or when one must walk through the spikes where the other one must lead the other. Or when the monster in the theatre comes too close. Then he shows you the theatre to understand what happened, and he then makes you leave them. Makes you leave someone you've connected with like he did with his wife. He kidnaps people to make them go through what he did, so he doesn't feel alone. We believe that the ""hollow monster"" thingy in the theatre is there for the sole purpose of making you go through the trap and then part ways as friends, or more than friends since we do not know if it's 2 girls or 2 boys or whatever, since we never see their faces. Moving on to last part - The maze... When theres two odd figures walking past when you pass two certain corners, we believe that it's connected to the start of it, where you see 4 companions and them separating 2 by 2. The strange figures may be the other two trapped in there not knowing where to go. One of them looks very alike the looks of both the players and the other one was crawling or limping forward."

I have been in the market for a great game for some time now and came across We Were Here and for FREE nonetheless. Played with my girlfriend using the walkie talkie for immersion purposes. The puzzles were complex enough to be fun but enough for those with <200IQ.One tip though. Play it with another person and use only the walkie talkie. Communication and teamwork is key.10/10 will accurately describe the phallic symbol and oveeruse the word ""over"" again.Over."

It clarifies everything, i think. (I have a buddy to play with, that's an important thing to note.)Beware! There'll be spoilers with ""Spoiler:"" tag, I don't want to ruin your fun.Pros:- Free- Nice puzzles- Atmosphere is scarier than most of the horror games.- Spoiler:It's scarier even without those silly jumpscares. I can swear I saw something dark while I was in the dungeon. (Playing explorer.) I thought that it was my buddy and told him to stop. ""Hey! I saw you, wait!"". Sad thing is, i didn't.- Need communication. Really.Cons:- Optimization. I have a mid-end laptop and i don't have fps drops in other games, but in this one, I have a bit of it.- Shooooort.- Have bugs."

A co op puzzle game that I can play with my friends online and it doesn't require a headset so they can still play with me using their preferred gameplay method. It is surprisingly well done for a free to play game and the music is really nice as well. The puzzles in themselves are actually pretty well done and it takes some thought to clear them from both players. A bonus is that the game actually comes off creepier than it seems upon an initial glimpse. Overall I would give it a solid 8/10. It's definitely worth a look if you like puzzles and it would still be worth it for a price tag of 10 USD. My only complaint with the game is that the vr mode could use some work. The mode is rather buggy and doesn't support motion controls which is why I docked 2 points. I feel like the game could be even more immersive if they could just add support for the vive controllers. Anyway keep up the good work :).

While you are marveling at this, you are at the same time freaked out. The game has a creepy vibe that makes you want to just LEAVE.

While some are pretty straightforward, others definitely require some more effort.+ Good audio quality+ Original idea. I personally really like the type of co-op games that make players rely purely on communication.- The game is based around talking to your partner through a walkie talkie. When my friend and I played, this did not work, so we had to use other software to communicate. Pretty major flaw, but as long as you're playing with a friend not too game-breaking. Major problem when you're going to play with a stranger.- It's rather short. Sure, this isn't necessarily a con, but the game is just so good, it leaves you craving for more."

,Recommended,582500,29944309,Posted: 15 February,all,HalfOfAKebab,"No spoilers in this review.Also please note that my friend and I used Discord to talk, not the game chat. This is important because only the Librarian can talk in the game, and the Adventurer can only listen to them. The Adventurer cannot communicate with the Librarian in any way. Using Discord is basically cheating, but I can't imagine ever completing this without it.Pros:- Fun way to kill an hour or so (depending on how fast you are at figuring stuff out; me and my friend were slow at figuring out the maze and the marionette show, so it took us almost two hours).- Creepy atmosphere. If you take too long on certain puzzles, kinda creepy stuff happens.- Seems like it has great speedrunning potential.- Seems like a good game to play for a YouTube video.Cons:- Can be somewhat frustrating at times if you're having trouble figuring out a puzzle.- No replayability. The game never changes, and it's really short. Once you've played the game through as both characters, you're done. However, there is a hidden achievement, but I don't know what it is. Maybe you can get a few more hours out of it if you want to hunt for it.- Runs quite laggy for some reason, especially when there's snow falling.Overall a very fun, free game, but it's just a shame it has no replayability. If it's ever updated to randomly generate the map each time, with a different maze, different puzzles, etc. every time, this would be an even better game."

I played with a friend so we could use discord to voicechat, and that solved the main problem. There are some bugs that you just have to wait out, for example the film reel dropped as I was setting it into position and it didn't register but I couldn't pick up the new one that spawned so we just had to wait for the other player to freeze to death. Crank turning is so mechanically bad, but also intergral to the two timed puzzels so it really leaves a bitter residue over the mind. The having no 'good' ending is also a mistake I feel, as it is always one lives one dies, and there are no extra puzzles to solve to have both players get through with feels very wrong considering the help you've given each other throughout the journey.It's a quick download, so if you have a friend ready totally dive into it with them, but playing with strangers is nigh impossible.

I actually do,dont get me wrong i realy enjoy the game,but the cons just outweigh the pro'sFirst of all i tried to play it,and immidiatly i am hit with 2 first problem's1.The walkie talkie mic dosent work,but the lobby one works perfectly2.The loading times,at least to me3.The film is bugged (again,at least for me)As i mentioned before,the game loads about 2-3 minutes to me,wich stopped after i reached the checkpoint with my friend,speaking of wich i was unable to play the game with strangers who refused to use teamspeak/discord or the mic itself.After the checkpoint i rolled the film again and again and again,one way or another but it just dint work,my friend even managed to freeze 2 times in the meantime,turns out you need to press e on the wheel to get a close-up of it and THEN roll it,wich worked (why have option to roll it outside the close-up when it dosent do nothing?).After wich the game froze for good 10 seconds,only to be greeted with black video,the video wich the essential clue shuld reside (again,this may just be me,but still)On a more positive note,i had a lot of fun with it,the atmosphere is pretty dang nice along with paranoid making sounds,like something stalks behind every corner along with puzzles,wich were amusing describing to eachother,and i would play it again as explorer if i would only be able to play the gameSo in short Pro/Con's recap:Pro's-Free-Nice,spooky setting along with sounds-The puzzles are original (wich took some time to figure out,wich is not bad)-A geniunely good time with someone to play with,especialy if you have a friendCons:-As of right now,game is bit too bugged (My partner once just fell while walking on the floor,bringing game over screen and second time i managed to 'glitch' out of the map and just fall along with the same result)-The essential walkie talkie mic dosent work-The long loading times (even if i tried minimal settings,it dosent have eny effect)My final rating would be 7/10,the game itself is amazing but the bug's just keep it back,or is my pc just so bad it cant run the game without the load and maybe the mic is bugged just for me,who knows?Edit:i know what film roll is and where it is,dont worry"

So you can't really complain.The premise is fairly simple, two players working together to solve puzzles. The puzzles were fairly reasonable, there was nothing too complex, which makes it accessible to more players, however sometimes lacks satisfaction.I would have liked to see more of the horror side, this is barely teased at in the current content.We recorded some of our playthrough if you want to see some gameplay.If you have a friend and 2 hours to kill you might as well give it a try!"

Amazing atmosphere too, me and my buddy were actually quite freaked out going through the tunnels (watch out for whats down there....) the music is great and even the few voices were on point. I love this game a lot and I really hope there is more updates or a longer version of this game gets released!

I almost gave up.Ok, VR is not necessary but even without VR oh man... the controls...Puzzles and coop in two different rooms is anincredibly good idea ! But the puzzles are sometimes not really requiring the two players as a bit of luck will suffice or are very easy sometimes and you just follow instructions.To sum up:- Puzzles need to be rethought to make it more challenging and balanced between the two players- The controls (interaction with objects and logic, conflicts) needs an urgent rework- Painfull menus- VR interfaces and controls are a messShame to give a negative review on a game that has great ideas but If this games or any DLC will be sold in the future, this is definitely not at a good stage."

So far I am not enjoying the game overall, it is fun to play and can be fun but it has issues that make it hard to enjoy. It is a fun game but is not a great game.Pros:-Fun Gameplay-Neat Skill Tree-Epic Explosions-Wingsuit and other gadgets/movements are fun additionsCons:-Repetitive Gameplay-Many outposts that need liberating are repetitive and just tedious-Same story as JC2-Frequent Lag/Stuttering-Occasional CrashesOverall it is a fun game and I would suggest getting it on sale but be prepared to play a mediocre game that can provide hours of fun that also includes poor optimization and crashing.This game is a game i would very much like to enjoy and continue playing but I cant. It starts off very fun and has good bosses and a fast way to get to them but later on it becomes very tedious and frustrating as the bosses start to become dumb and unfair and you have to spend awhile through a gimicky version of legend of zelda which adds nothing to the game just to get back to the boss and die in a matter of seconds, this makes it hard to beat bosses as the long walk time adds to the anger of dying. Play this game only if you have alot of patience or an old keyboard you dont mind breaking.35 hours in and I think its already fair to say this is one of the greatest games I have ever played.Hurtworld is a perfect mixture of what makes so many other games such as red dead redemption and skyrim great. It has a wonderful combat system that makes you choose what sword to use, what spells to use, what strategies to use and whether or not to go right in on a group of soldiers or strafe carefully around a giant beast. There are plenty of quests and the main story lasts very long compared to other games that have short campaigns around 10 - 20 hours. I am 35 hours in already and know I have much more to go. The Hurtworld has many different types of quests from following the trail of a thief to entering the cave of a beast that has been attacking a village. From following the main story you pick up many side quests that will leave you deciding whether to continue the main quest or take the time to help the farmer who is being annoyed by a ghost. You will have many quests in your quest bar that you can take the time to complete or not. I currently have around 20 side quests that I have decided to move on from and 10 that I still have to find time to take care of. There is also a point of interest system in this game where you can come across many different things around the map such as a monster nest or a bandit camp that can lead you all over the place just going from place to place, finding loot upon loot and killing enemy upon enemy. The environment in this game is one of the most place I have seen as there are so many different types of areas such as the snowy mountains to the green fields. This game also has some of the best graphics I have seen and runs well on my pc on high settings. This game very much deserves all the awards it has won and the developers have done a great job on this masterpiece. Thank you CD Projekt Red for making the Witcher 3.This is the longest review I have written but no other game deservers it.Hurtworld is probably the best game I have ever played. It has so many possibilities and things to do and you could even spend hours in the single player sandbox due to the awesome modding community this game has. Not only does it have an epic mod community it also has a great multiplayer community aside from all the squeekers, hackers and abusive mods. There are just so many gamemodes and mods that you could spend hundreds to thousands of hours in it. With thousands of mods and plenty new ones every day this game is hard to get bored of. I have also made many friends on servers such as TTT, Murder and DarkRP. It is also very fun to play private servers with friends and doing your own thing. All you need is hamachi which is free. This game is only 10 dollars but also requires CS: Source so get the bundle.You can do so many things in this such as roleplay a swat sniper, become a watermelon, have hovercar races and my favourite; get tellitubbies to fight a t-rex. Just get the game if you dont have it already.Hurtworld: Greatest game I have played that you can spend countless hours in and wont get bored. Just get it.Who doesnt love being chased by naked men with rocks?Macho man dragon came and saved me from my execution.My favourite mmorpg where you can create your own freaking super hero and do super hero crap and be A. MUTHA. FLIPPING. SUPER. HERO!!!Fun game with good story. Easier with a controller because of auto aim :)Bought the game because demo was too easy and was easily able to get past 2nd night. Died on 2nd night after buying game... 8/8 gr8 m8A free fun game that isnt an unfair battle between people who pay and people who dont. Very fun gameplay. like battelfield but free and ww2. ⅘Great quick little game that is fun to play when waiting for a game to load or just want to quickly play a game.One of the most compelling games i have ever played. its very short but i loved the story and the voice acting. there are alot of clues pointing to thing you find later in the game that you look back. i would suggest it but 20 dollars is a high price for a game that lasts about an hour. 9/10Very fun game for only a dollar. Just get itExtremely fun open world mmo fps. I highly suggest it as long as you dont mind walking alot. You will also need a fast computer with alot of space because this is a very big game.If Michael Bay made Mario…Hasn't given me a seizure yet. 10/10Turned the enemy spawn settings to the max and got molested by 3 flying horsemen. 10/10Made a gun called the ""Virginity Defender"". Sad to say, it doesn't work. 10/10The best part of the game is the voice that reads what you type out loud. Hearing Stephen Hawken sing ""Loveshack"" makes me laugh so hard. 10/10You either get your butt kicked or live long enough to be called a hacker. 10/10There is nothing more fun than running around hitting people on the head with a baseball bat. 10/10The game looks quite mysterious and fun from the traitler but it lies. It is an extremely boring game that has you running around looking for oxygen tanks the whole time. 2/10. I'm lucky i got it from the humble bundleI chased a whale for awhile and when i finally grappled on i tried to dig into it but it kicked me off and i fell for a long time untill i suffocated in the gas zone. Great Game! 10/10The Guide kept opening the door and leaving when zombies were trying to break in and he let them in and they ate me. Then proceeded to come back in and try and tell me how to craft stuff.10/10Jumped off a cliff into water. Died halfway in midair and woke up in a cave with a naked combined crab person. 11/10(In Battle Royale)""Hey look at that plane""""Whats it dropping?""""Oh sweet its a carepackage""""Why is it dropping so many carepackages?""*BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM**Dead*11/10 Would rage again.Worst game i have ever played. It is a walking simulator that is so buggy that it makes you want to gouge your own eyes out with a teaspoon. You fall 2 feet and you die. A 10 degree metal sheet is apparently slippery enough to work as a functioning slip and slide sending you to your own death. It takes over 2 hours to walk from 1 side of the map to the other in a map that looks the same all over with russian named towns so you cant tell your friends where you are and with signs with 8 pixels so you cant read the name.The only thing they could add to this game that would make me play it ever again is vehicle, which is in their roadmap but has been in the roadmap for a year. Dont waste your money. buy Hatoful Boyfriend instead because you will actually laugh or have fun with that game instead of spending 4 hours walking around"

I'm not saying they should get rid of the Multiplayer part, just make it both single player and Multiplayer. Maybe one day they will make a single player game similar to this game. It doesn't seem like a bad game , so for those who do enjoy using mics and playing together , that's fine. I'm just more of a single player type of gamer.Just my opinion anyway."

The puzzles are fun and not too easy but not hard ( That's not a bad thing, it keeps the game going without really struggling ). The only thing is that it's quite short and it's basically the same all over again. It would be nice if more Rooms where added and each time it would be random what Puzzle you get. Plus I think if you could play it with more people and for example there are like 5 People in total, 2 could be the librarien and the other 3 have to cooperate to solve the puzzles. Something like that would be great in my opinion! But all in all it's a really cute and fun game, plus it's free.

I played the game with my roommate (we were in the same room) so we didn't have to/get to utilize the walkie talkie system, but I think it would add a great dynamic, while slightly increasing the difficulty of each puzzle in a positive manner.  Overall, a great play that won't take up more than a night of your life.(***SPOILER ALERT/REVIEW CONTINUED***) I wouldn't mind a little more depth/continuation, especially after both players meet up (I do understand it is a FTP). The final decision to be made also felt a little gimicky with no real impact on the player's emotional connection to the game, as it was so immediate in relation to the end of the game. I also would like to see a little more fear-inducing moments, which add a sense of immediacy to the puzzles. I believe three puzzles had such a dynamic, but only the theater puzzle truly makes you scramble to solve the puzzle due to pure fear."

It should be noted that certain puzzles randomise between playthroughs while others don't. so when replaying the game if your memory is good enough you can get through other puzzles swiftly without the need of your friend to help. that being said, if each player is new to the game it makes for a wonderful co-op experience and I'd love for more games to make use of this kind of Asymetric Co-operative game.The game also features VR support, for a more, immersive puzzling experience, while i am unable to try this feature of the game myself, i can only assume it would add to the experience immensly."

I definetly did not expect it to get as scary as it did at the play area, especially when I am not prone to fear by video games. I would like to see the possibility of a ""good"" ending explored, and more lore about the castle where you are. It's clear there's something very strange going on. For a free game, it's outstanding, and I would definetly pay a few bucks to get a little more content. The way some puzzles are randomly generted adds a small amount of replay value, when you switch who is ""explorer"" and who is ""librarian"", but after that there if not much left to explore.

Had a great time playing through this with a friend and I can only recommend it.The only problem that I have with this game is that the VR mode is simply not working. I can get into the menu but then I get stuck already, because I can't select any of the options. I figured out it uses some sort of gazing selection thing which is typical for most oculus games, however the controller simply won't work (I am using an xbox 360 controller).I can't even rebind the controls in the options to any of the controller buttons so it's almost like it doesn't pick up the controller's input at all. While the game was great regardless I feel it would've been even better if I would've been able to experience it in VR, so I can only suggest that the dev(s) spend some time trying to get it to work!Also I deperately want more of it now.. but I guess for the amazing price mentioned earlier I can't expect unlimited content :P4/5 from me if I could give it a rating :P"

It's a mix between ""Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes"" and room puzzles. One person has the information, while the other does the actions, communicating with walkie-talkies.The success of the game relies on your partner.  If you get a smart, capable person like I did, then you can breeze through the game without much difficulty (at least from the Explorer persepective).  As this game is free, there is absolutely no reason not to try it.The concept is an interesting one, and I could imagine an expanded game being very fun to play. Perhaps you could race against other teams of people to see who can get done first, or have elimination rounds?  If they expand the game and make the puzzles variable or more challenging, I could see myself paying for it.Overall, it was a fun experience."

,Recommended,582500,29806199,Posted: 9 February,all,Swoyer^,"This is a good short game for sure and the idea is awesome. I finished the game both as explorer and the librarian.Some things are hard to interact with and the puzzles sometimes bugs out so that you have to reset.I'd love to see a game like this in full size, make it a bit more scary perhaps, make the puzzles more random, maybe even have them in different orders and/or that you add more puzzles into it and randomize which ones you get. This way you can't steamroll through the game up to the point you have gotten before (which was basicly what me and my friend did).Add some enemies to the game that literally will chase you and that you have to hide from, even more awesome if they reacted on sounds like when the players are talking to eachother, movement and even throwing objects somewhere.All in all if you like puzzle games, have a friend to play with it's entertainment for an hour or so. Or even play with a random person can also be lots of fun. The downpart to this game is that once you have completed it once or twice there is nothing that makes you wanna keep it in your game library."
,Recommended,582500,29775204,Posted: 7 February,all,ForceKin,"Great experience. We got about an hour and a half out of this free game and had a lot of fun with it. It was a bit buggy (couldn't use the in-game walkie talkies, but we had Discord so no big deal), but the puzzles were fun and the reliance on communication was very obvious and enjoyable. The only game-breaking bug came right at the very end, after completing the final puzzle. We were unable to go through the trapdoor to complete the game, which is unfortunate because the ending is hilarious. Anyway, for a free title, it was more fun than most of these damn tech demos we see released en masse. Highly recommended."

,Not Recommended,582500,29775692,Posted: 7 February,all,Obviously Dracula,"VR USERS (VIVE AND OCULUS, MAYBE MORE) - PLEASE READ - This review is purely for VR.So, this game makes it pretty obvious that you can play it in VR optionally, and yes you totally can, but...Firstly: THE GAME LAUNCHES 2D NORMALLY. Basically, the menus are 2D. VR users are spoiled on 3D VR menus, so this  initially seems wrong. ONCE YOU ACTUALLY START A GAME, YOU SEE EVERYTHING IN 3D VR.Second: THERE IS NO SUPPORT FOR THE VR CONTROLLERS. Your vive wands and your Oculus Touch won't work here. So, naturally, since keyboard and mouse doesn't really work well with VR, A GAMEPAD IS NEEDED. I dont think keyboard and mouse even works in VR.Third: THE GAME IS REALLY UNOPTIMISED FOR VR. I mean, the game itself has bugs and such but the controls for VR are especially not so great. Besides using a gamepad, your 'gaze' crosshair is your cursor. USING THE MENUS WITH A GAMEPAD IN VR IS CONFUSING, FRUSTRATING, AND POORLY DONE. Me and my partner had to start over twice in our playthrough and could never finish because anytime anyone died, I literally could not select 'retry from checkpoint', all I could do was press A, which was quit completely.Fourth: THIS ISN'T A SEATED EXPERIENCE, ITS PRETTY MUCH JUST STANDING. The game puts your in-game head height to your real height so, if you're sitting down, you cant see some things you need to look at - you have to get up.Fifth: This might have just been something on my end - not sure - but launching from SteamVR, I kept getting stuck in 'waiting for We Were Here' on the main menu. I had to quickly click the 'look for game' option to not get stuck in that.Basically, this is a terrible mess for VR. The game looks great. The gameplay is confusing (in the way escape-the-room games are) and fun when it works.IF YOU'RE WANTING A COOL IMMERSIVE VR EXPERIENCE FOR THIS THOUGH, ID HOLD OFF UNTIL ISSUES ARE FIXED.If you're just gaming on a monitor though, It's probably pretty fun.Like seriously, I know its free but this game seems like it should have stayed in closed development for a few more months."

,Recommended,582500,30074870,Posted: 21 February,all,Erufen Rito,"This will be a very cut and dry review. TL:DR at the bottomAlthough the game is fun, it has zero replay value. Once you've done either role, you have pretty much done both. I have 2.5h on it, because I did exactly that. I started as the explorer, finished, then went as the navigator. The first runthrough, Me and my friend spent maybe 1.5h getting the puzzles solved. On the 2nd run, we completed it in maybe 40 minutes.The missing 20 minutes come from bugs, restarts and the odd crash. Sometimes the radio doesn't work, so you have to restart the game. Sometimes one party fails to load. All minor bugs, but present none the less.Overall, I stronly recomend this game to anyone who has one friend to play with. It is fun, it is short, and it does force you to think [My friend could not figure out the map for the dungeon, so while he struggled with it, I just solved it on my own, then froze to death].TL:DR: Totally recomend it, once. Find a friend, go yell at each other over a radio."

The only downside is it's only worth one play through if you don't care about achievements. Once you've played as either the adventurer or Librarian you know how everything works and makes the second play through really easy.It is however a free game so play it if you've never watched anyone play it before and get your friend to play with you. It's a really cool experience and all the achievements are just for playing through as both the librarian and the explorer.4/5 it would be a perfect 5 but the fact that after one playthrough the games wonder is gone second playthrough was only interesting cause I got to see the Librarian playthrough. Still great one-shot game. I'd pay like 2-5 bucks just to support the devs because unlike most indie developers they didn't try to tackle a survival/horror game that's got a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of promised features, takes seven years to get to beta and then get's dropped.

One of you is an explorer, which moves around the castle and solves the puzzles, and the other one is a librarian, who helps the explorer with the puzzles. Communication is a really heavy factor in solving these puzzles and I highly recommend getting a friend to play with.There are some spooks in the game (no jumpscares though), which helps to build the atmosphere. Once you complete the first few puzzles and get the hang of it, the puzzles will become progressively harder. I also recommend getting a pen and paper to help you solve a few puzzles.The bugs that people are talking about are being fixed ASAP, and some of them are already fixed, so you don't have to worry.And hey, it's free ! :) Try it out for yourself."

It's an important point because it is a little buggy and incomplete (you can jump out of the map in some places, the built-in VOIP doesn't work, it's relatively short, and a puzzle or two required blind luck).THAT BEING SAID, my brother and I spent a couple hours playing through it and we had a blast. Without giving too much away, it was a test of patience and we really had to pull out the stops on our communication and imagination to help each other get through each puzzle. The game doesn't hold your hand and point out the obvious solution which I LOVE. It simply throws you into a room, and it's up to you to figure out what the heck is going on.I wish it was longer and a bit more polished, but it would be great if more puzzles were released in a Portal-style fashion."

,Recommended,582500,29866625,Posted: 11 February,all,lucktacular,"A friend told me about this game, and it looked interesting, so we both downloaded it in just a few minutes.I started out as the librarian, and after getting my bearings figured out the first puzzle pretty quick. Most puzzles were not too tough, but required you to pay attention to your surroundings.We did get stuck on the table map puzzle, because something was wrong with my sound and I never noticed that the lever would lower the chandelier. My buddy and I started over, switching roles and this time the sound worked so he was able to notice that part of the puzzle, and we got through the game without too much more trouble. We had to restart a couple of times at checkpoints when we took a little too long, but it wasn't a big deal.Controls were mostly fine. Except one annoying thing was when you had to rotate a lever, it said to press Escape to exit that function, but pressing Escape would also bring up the menu. You can just exit the menu and it's fine, but it's a little annoying especially on the last puzzle when you have to do a lot of that.Overall it was a very fun challenge. I would be interested in buying future DLC that added new levels to get through if it was priced right."

Good puzzles2. Good concept of utilizing walkie-talkies3. Good environment detail and overall graphics4. Good use of ambience and atmosphere (and scene setting5. Fun puzzles!Cons -1. Hot spot for levers were stupid. Increase the range please, it's frustrating trying to work the lever when your 'E' doesn't even pick up. This frustration is NOT part of the puzzle, so should be fixed.2. You don't actually drown?? Also, Mine bugged, all the water was gone, then suddenly the animation of it draining played again.3. Floating walkie talkies..4. Restarting the last ""Play"" means having to do the silly North, S, E, W puzzle again.Overall I rate it 8/10 because I believe it met its intent.Thank you."

,Recommended,582500,29761093,Posted: 7 February,all,Echo,"The puzzles weren't unsolvable or too difficult, but it was fun describing the symbols to my friend. At many points, the game was kinda like Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, I'm surprised it's not on the list of games it was inspired by. Ask and guide your friend, and pressure them to death while they freeze to... death. Yeah.For free, it's a good one-time-game with a friend. I don't recommend playing it with randoms and I wouldn't pay for it, either - there are too many downsides.Such as:- the game has no replayability whatsoever; it's over in 60 minutes or less- walkie-talkies didn't work at all, we had to use Steam for communication- the collision was sometimes weird- rotating the books was a nightmare- the game is badly optimized, my Dell Latitude 3330 had to run it on low settings and the letters weren't readable with low quality textures- the wind's volume is handled by the music volume slider- the models of the players at the very end were extremely disappointing, they had no colouring at all- it had one ending only when there should've been two at least, considering the environment the characters were put into (break down the torches and put it on the platform...)"

This game is also pretty creepy. Me and my friend blueman3678 got till the third door and he kinda freaked out. He was the explorer and he heard FOOTSTEPS. I forgot to mension but there are the explorer and the librarian. In the game there are hints in each room that help one another to get through in each room. Its kinda hard to explain but its pretty fun."
,Recommended,582500,29860586,Posted: 11 February,all,DoM,"First let me start by saying that this is by no mean a perfect game. However it is a brillant one in my opinion, the cooperative element of this game tests your communication abilities and really puts a strain on your patience. The horror aspect of the game was good enough if you dont want a game to scare you however if you want one that blows you a way, you better look elsewhere. The puzzles were good and change around on each playthrough meaning there is the aspect of replayability so you can get a different perspective on the game and get the achievements.  PLUS this is free to play when they could easily charge around $5. Although it can be completed twice in around 2-3hours it offers great laughs when you hear the other person get freaked out by a shadow. One criticism I have is the hitboxes to interact with some items are a little annoying, while playing as the explorer the theater handles can get stressful. Other than that this game is definitely recommended. All in all if they created another game similar I would definitely play it."

,Recommended,582500,29864455,Posted: 11 February,all,Nymsaj,"I really really liked this game. I was at first taken back that the voice to voice worked so seamlessly. I was expecting that we would have to download some separate add on or speak via discord in order to communicate throughout the game. That was not the case. Don't expect the puzzles to be too easy, they are challenging and definitely involve being able to communicate with your partner effectively. The visual appeal of the castle is great, with very nice detail applied throughout. I admit me and my partner got to a point were we were stuck, but I'd rather have a great challenge than an easy walkthrough. Great job in development of this game. Very fun to play.Lastly, I love how the puzzles regenerate each time you die and return. You don't get the same puzzle you just attempted. Also, you may want to adjust the in-game sound to low. When you get near to dying, the music gets loud and can drown out the communication between you and your partner."

,Recommended,582500,29921946,Posted: 14 February,all,Gnome Linebacker,"Wonderful CO-OP game.  You must use a microphone in order to solve the puzzles in the game. This game requires a lot of ""Charades"" type of explaining from one player to another in order to solve puzzles. If the darkness doesn't kill you, the water or freezing cold might.  So stay witty and on your toe's because you are in for an interesting adventure."

76561198278868581,Recommended,582500,29929847,Posted: 14 February,all,The Doctor,This game is very much fun to play. I played it with a friend and we've been sitting there for over two hours to complete the story. I really have to say that this Game is absolutely incredible and I appreciated playing it a lot probably because of the fact you really have to talk with your mate to solve thoses mysteries. The riddles at the beginning were not that hard but at the end there was a little bit of time pressure. I'd like to see a part 2.

This isn't the biggest problem if you are speaking over an alternate program like skype with your friend though.Overall the concept is cool, and it is well executed. I would be happy to pay money for a longer game."

,Recommended,582500,30048050,Posted: 19 February,all,Mlgracecardriver,"Awesome game here, for a free-to-play game this brings a new type of playstyle to the table. Being able to play this game based purely on the co-operation of other players Is genius and I would love to see more from the game developers with games like this. These games are the reason that the free-to-play section is worth taking a look at from time to time on steam. Short and sweet and it makes you use your heads as one! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"

I spent most of the time near the end pleading with my friend to complete the puzzles faster lol. If this game gets longer maps and more random puzzles in the future, it would easily be worth paying money for."

,Recommended,582500,30051268,Posted: 19 February,all,Al Willows,"I don't usually post reviews, but since I'm literally listening to my friends try the game after me and another friend played it, I feel the need to because it's united us.This game is pretty great with the puzzles, as well as adding moments of panic with the background music and the timed puzzles. I'd like there to eventually be either more puzzles, more randomization, or perhaps multiple endings, but I definitely can't complain because it was great.However, one thing I think you should note down for other players is that there are jump scares and 'eerie horror' elements. While they aren't the focus in the game, and most can be missed(and who knows, it might just all be according to the players perspective) I know some people may not pick this game up because of these things, or would at least appreciate a warning of sorts.Either way, great game and I hope there's DLC in the future!"
