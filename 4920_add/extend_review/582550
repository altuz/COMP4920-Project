76561198055631052,Recommended,582550,32814400,Posted: 26 June,all,Rafalo15,"Flamebait Games' Passpartout: The Starving Artist is a true indie gem.I first heard of this game through Jim Sterling and his video on it and just had to try it for myself. Glad I did.Passpartout is a relatively simple game with a simple task. You're given what is essentially a stripped down version of MS Paint with which you can paint practically whatever comes to mind, given that you have the creativity and talent for it.Something I don't really have, which is why I ended up specialising in the minimalist style.Another thing is that you need to make a certain amount each week to ensure that you have enough for rent and to also feed your addiction to wine and baguettes.Initially, you have a brush and the standard colours with shades of each, as you progress you unlock a spray can and pen to further improve your artistic visions. However, more tools and the ability to mix colours or fill in blank spaces would be nice but given the asking price for the game, this is still worth it.The game is split into three chapters, the first chapter takes place in a crime ridden alley with you living and plying your trade out of a garage. A neat twist however, is that depending on what style you focus on and which client you cater to, you can end up in what looks to be a half-built gallery (minimalist) or a nice cozy apartment/gallery (expressionist). For the third and final chapter, the minimalist branch will end up in a gallery and expressionist will place you in what I assume to be a countess's mansion as a private artist.Of course, I ended up in the gallery because my minimalistic style was just too good for those snarky, expressionist loving ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Clearly my masterpieces that consisted of a canvas coloured in two different colours was just too much for them.Over the course of the game, potential clients will come and go, perusing your art and ""critiquing"" it, hinting at whether anything can be changed or not. This could range from a simple ""this is crap"" to ""Good, but not the right colours"". Then finally someone would come along and pick one of my disa... masterpieces, proclaiming it to be ""a true work or art"" and in some cases ""after buying this, my heart may never be broken again"".What Passpartout made me realise is that I really, really wanted to punch anyone that criticised my work. Just like a true artist.It took me just over 10 hours to finish Passpartout on the minimalist route and I like to think someday I'll come back to do an expressionist one, but that requires some modicum of artistic talent.For a game that costs a mere £6.99 I got more hours out of it than most AAA games today, which says something. Some additions in the future such as the aforementioned tools and modes such as a sandbox or challenge mode would make this already great game even better.Review can also be found athttp://www.gamefold.net/passpartout-the-starving-artist/"
,Recommended,582550,32298712,Posted: 9 June,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"I have a lot to say about this title, and everything is with such mixed emotions.Passpartout: The Starving Artistgives the indie gaming world anabsolutely brilliantmechanic that is just brimming with potential, and then yanks the carpet out from underneath all of your lofty ideas of where the gamecould and shouldgo.This seriously could have been Indie GOTY material, but falls short in too many areas that would have been so simple to implement compared to the heavy lifting that has already been done to get the game this far.Essentially, this title gives you a simplified version ofMS Paintcoupled with a shockingly smart AI audience that judges your artwork through offering to buy it at various prices.BUT it actually manages to have this deep level it reaches wherein you find yourself actually managing to get better with these simple tools and creating better artwork on your own accord. It definitely has a zen-like quality that works oh-so well.The music is superb.After a bit of creating and naming paintings, you earn an additional painting tool.Oh my gawd, this is gonna level up toPhotoshop-esque quality, and OMG I'm gonna have a gallery and manage my money and rent locations! The potential!That was the thought process as I played, but unfortunately it fizzles quick and the deeper stuff I hoped for falls short leaving the core experience kind of paper-thin.What I want is a remake of this title, with the following ideas considered:A gallery to visit all of your past work, and not just a screenshot saving button; as it stands, you lose all paintings except for screenshots you take - but nothing is viewable in-game.I want to be able to take my earned money and buy new art tools, and LOTS of them. I want color palettes, a whole slew of brush sizes and shapes, filters, tints, different canvas sizes (you can't even choose to paint in landscape mode), etc. The list could go on forever.I want to be able to paint with the canvas filling up the whole screen.I want to be able to view and buy other real players paintings, even if only in a pseudo-online mode.That's just some food-for-thought.But I still recommend the game.The feels I get when learning new techniques with these simple tools is well worth the asking price.I just want so much more.And the idea merits more than what you get.Pros:+Brilliant idea and use of a simple mechanic; the total is greater than the sum of the parts+Music is fantastic+Curiously good AI+Really funCons:-Horribly wasted potential in almost every sense-The game doesn't even save your paintings to view in the future-Paper thin game other than the actual painting part-If you are someone that is not inherently creative, or needs to be lead by the hand and be told what to do/goals to achieve, stay away - this is purely a creative endevourPasspartoutcould have really taken the indie scene by storm, but instead puttered out for lack of depth and use of its potential.I still have a lot of love for it, though."

But yet again the game just came out so I really hope they can add more updates like new brushes and modes.please developers read this.

However, your paintings either don't sell at all, or someone bids on them right away.  You would think even a lousy painting would sell eventually and a great painting might sit for awhile.  It would be nice if you could price the paintings yourself, or if a patron could commission a painting.  It is very repetitive with little actual gameplay. I just wish this game had more. More of everything: More cash management, paint colors, type of patrons, an ability to customize your studio, maybe advertise your gallery, customize your character, choose what type of patrons to cater to, have lots of different types of paint brushes, choose your location, etc.  At this point, this should really be a free game because there just isn't much content."

,Recommended,582550,33557587,Posted: 15 July,all,-V-,"Passpartout could easily be dismissed as a game copy of MS paint, but to do that would be to miss out on this wonderful casual game!Sure, the tools are limited, but the satisfaction... the satisfaction is UNlimited.You won't even need any skill to start with; chances are, you'll develop some artistic skill along the way!Challenge yourself to create fantastic works of art using 24 colors.Don't believe me?  Check the screenshots for this game, and you'll see some of the masterpieces players have created using only a paintbrush of variable size, a spray can, and a more precise line-ish tool. (Don't check mine-- some are lewd and most are mediocre in comparison)This game is easy to get 100% achievements, if you are in to that sort of thing (I am!).  There are 3 stages with  4 different endings to get, and once you get all 4, you'll likely have gotten all the achievements.Practice minimalism, realism, expressionism, and abstract, all without staining your clothes!I was honestly surprised at how ""into"" this game I got.  I began to live for my ""art"" and wonder to myself, ""WHY DON'T I HAVE A PAINT SET?"" and I admit,I paid full price for this game. Not a penny was wasted in my enjoyment.So excuse me, I'm off to the arts & crafts store."
,Recommended,582550,32244639,Posted: 7 June,all,Venceremos,"I don't usually write reviews like this, but for Passpartout that's the best I can come up with I think.In my sophomore year, I took American Contemporary Art. At the end of the semester it required me to do a presentation and I was left with Mark Rothko.During the presentation something went wrong with my slides, or the projector. Anyway it went pitch black. Darker than my lungs. And for a moment I was so embarrassed. People sat in silence as if they enjoyed every second of the incident.Then I came up with something. I told them this was titledBlack in Black. Done in the year 1968. And I elaborated the social circumstances and my assumption of its purpose, so on and so forth. True story.Anyway I improvised and nailed it. I think the professor didn't fall for that (but he must have enjoyed it) but the class totally did. And that's how I lost faith in modern art.Of course I am not saying Mark Rothko is bad. If the presentation slides were able to reproduce the subtlety of his paintings I couldn't have pulled the stunt smoothly.And playing through Passpartout reminds me of that experience. For me the game is hilariously realistic and painfully true."
76561198025034579,Recommended,582550,32937794,Posted: 28 June,all,mnemos,"I obsessed over my masterpiece for nearly an half an hour, selecting each color and placing each line just so, before deeming it ready for exhibition The first person to see it was an aristocrat wearing a powdered wig: she promptly decried it as unoriginal garbage, and left without even looking at anything else. I think she came into my gallery specifically to insult me. This is Passpartout, and possibly the art world it’s mocking, in a nutshell. You will pour your soul into a piece only for it to be misunderstood and mocked, and then be praised as a wunderkind for a painting that’s just the poop emoji on a rainbow background. I know because I sold that painting. I am not proud.Passpartout is not deep game. I mostly stuck to abstract paintings not only because I lack talent, but also because the toolset the game offers (basically a few functions from MS Paint) makes it very hard to paint anything with any degree of precision. I took wild stabs in the dark when guessing what kind of paintings my patrons wanted, because they always seemed more interested in telling me what they didn’t like about a painting than what they did like. I tried painting a coffee cup for an older gentleman named George, because he always carried one with him; he loved it, and I was even able to bleed a few extra euros out of him for it. Though the guesswork and imprecision occasionally make the game feel directionless, they’re more features than they are flaws. That’s because Passpartout has very little interest in making you feel like a master of your craft or giving you the tools necessary to produce worthwhile art. It’s much more interested in watching you flail about wildly in an attempt to produce something passable, and then scam strangers into buying your misbegotten creations when you inevitably fail.In the end, I attracted the attention of a wealthy patron who was more than happy to pay increasingly outrageous sums for whatever garbage I churned out. The art critics spurned me and called me a sellout, but it was hard to care when I didn’t have to worry about paying bills anymore. Was it a worthwhile journey? Yeah, probably, but more for the narrative I pieced together in my head than for any particularly outstanding mechanics. There’s the lack of direction I mentioned before, and pacing occasionally becomes an issue. There were times when no one wanted to buy my paintings and I wasn’t sure why, or extended periods when my work was flying off the shelf faster than I could produce it, and I was just waiting for the next act to trigger. Passpartout is generally good at hiding it’s technical shortcomings under a flurry of madcap nonsense, but in its quieter moments you begin to see its limitations and experience some of the drudgery that must come with being an actual real-life artist. Still, it’s to the game’s credit (or maybe just luck?) that even its failures can be hand-waved away as being part of the experience. Whether or not that experience will appeal to you ultimately comes to how willing you are to be carried away by its particular brand of comedy."

(Has the depth of a small flash game.  You draw, and the NPCs either hate it or buy it, repeat. That's it. NPCs only comment if they hate it, and they'll be using the same 2 phrases over and over again. Rinse and repeat for 3 stages. The stages are all the same and have no variety. No events, no NPC interaction, etc. Money means nothing, after you sell your 1st painting, you don't have to worry about money.)Only 3 tools. You gain 2 more tools as you play, a lame paint spray and a useless inking pen. (which is basically a slower paintbrush, seriously, there's no difference) They couldn't even program the rest of MSpaint in the game.No replayability. (This is my main concern about this game. There's no game+, only one difficulty, and no other modes. Have fun playing through the same stage)Ending (The ending dialogue is cringy and dumb. Words flash on the screen and it just ends. You don't get to see the art you've made. No gallery. Nothing. You can close the game, or play the same 3 similar stages over again.)Conclusion:It's a great idea, but this game is weakly developed. Quickly developed for some sort of cash grab.I loooove the concept and bought right away, which I really regret. So buyers beware. I really hope some other devs pick up this idea and make a better game, so I can be a starving artist in RL and in-game.There's soo much that could've been done here, and I'm just sitting here disappointed.3/10 - Not worth it at 8$. Wait for a sale until it's a dollar or less, or better yet wait for the inevitable humble bundle."
,Not Recommended,582550,32329162,Posted: 10 June,all,grunesdragon,"This is... a demo. I like it, I love the concept, but that doesn't mean it isn't a demo. Details below.Pros: It is charming visually and has a perfectly nice soundtrack, the concept for the game is fantastic and relatable, and the  simple narrative of a starving artist is, without any effort needed, personal and touching. Trying to produce art as fast as you can while also naturally channeling your emotional state into it, all while trying to survive, I think naturally touches anyone who's done art for a long time. The rating system is a bit wonky, but also surprisingly accurate, and the frustration of people not liking a piece you really like yourself is genuine and doesn't feel unfair.Cons: It is missing a lot of narrative and it is... let's say limited... for what it tries to do. It is never clear what day it is or when your bills are due, and it takes some amount of doublethink to figure out whether you're looking at this week's or last week's bills. The process of paying bills I can't tell whether it happens automagically - in a game where you'd want to scrutinize all your spending, there's no control and almost no way to tell what's going on in that regard. The drawing tools are pretty bad, granted it's fun to go back to drawing with a mouse in MS Paint but my god, even MS Paint has an eraser - don't tell me that's for realism, as there are definitely ways to lift paint. Also a color wheel would be better than a limited palette as you can mix whatever you want with paint, as well as angled brushes would come in very handy. The story progression is easy to miss and there's no diagram or simple list of tick marks showing you where you are in the story, so every minute of gameplay feels the same as the last one without feeling like you're making any progress. This game went from charming to irritating within 25 minutes of play (+ watching someone else play it).Optional, but seeing as this game's main appeal is to artists, it'd be nice to have support for Wacom/Bamboo tablets as well.Overall I would love to see this game expand in the future, I hope this isn't the final product."

From what I've seen from Passpartout, it seems like a pleasant game to unwind with a bit. The game can either last you one hour, or 10+ hours, simply depending on what type of games you enjoy. Before purchasing, it might be best to watch someone else play it for a few minutes to help you decide.The concept is simple, you draw with your given tools, sell what you create, and move up in the art world.You don't have to a brilliant artist to play this game, and I'll mention most everything I've put up for sale looked like absolute crap to date. But things still sell, and I still enjoy myself finding out what each character prefers to buy.I do believe some things could be added (more colors, more drawing tools to work with?), but the game is still lovely with what you're given."

For me, it's relaxing, up to an hour at a time.After you finish a stage, you get different locale, with different customers.There is no real danger, I don't know how bad you would need to be to fail paying the rent :)The progression could be slower though, depending how good you are, but the point is to relax. Paint a few things, close the game, return when feeling like it's draw time again :)For the low price it sells, it's worth it.It's a greenlight game and they should thank Jim Sterling for the recognition :) I know I wouldn't have seen it otherwise at least."

There is no depth to the gameplay; basically what you do is just make paintings with MS Paint-like canvas and tools, over and over. The AI seems to favor carefully painted pieces, which probably translates to numerous and slow brush strokes, which is a torture to do with a mouse, when I have a Wacom tablet right in front of me, but it's not supported by the game. I'm not expecting pressure sensitivity (which would be awesome!), but the game doesn't even detect the pen touching the tablet as a click.But if you're fine with drawing repeatedly with a mouse, over and over, expecting nothing, then I guess this game can be enjoyable for you. The music is nice and relaxing enough.For those who are used to painting digitally with tablet and Photoshop, though, it will probably feel like a torture."

You can be as serious (or as I would call it 'the good', 'the bad' and 'the ugly') as you want in such a thing. I admit I thought it was a straight threw linear experience but looking through achivements I found myself incorrect when I saw the multiple endings achievement which now leaves me curious on how to approach. This is not a bad thing though!It's a casually playing game where there is no time, no speed and a 'do it at your own pace' game that you can sit with a drink and relax while listening to your own music (or the games music, it was very soothing for me.) I am definately happy I took the chance on this game. If I had to give a real 'con' to the game I would say it was the lack of tools (3 given total, again this is MSpaint so there isn't a lot of variety to began with) but I guess it could ruin the 'starving artist simulator' concept.So unless you don't like drawing or do not enjoy a slow pace game, I would avoid.Otherwise, I am all for this game!"

Sell physical paintings to customers as they walk through your wares? Look no further than Passpartout: The Starving Artist! Don’t worry about the starving part.Set in France, you have a few levels to sell your paintings. But...you don’t start at the top. You start around the bottom, not so much where you are sitting on the sidewalk but at your storage space. Unknown by the public, work your way up so you can make an impact in the art world. Or just go bankrupt.And man, will it not be easy at all. You can, technically, draw whatever you want and still progress but it has no guarantee of selling. You will have three different brushes, the regular paint brush, the spray can, and a guided pen (the last 2 being earned after a certain amount of sold paintings) to make what you desire or what the customers desire. Everyone has different tastes to what they like, and you are not marketing to yourself. Even more frustrating, they will be cryptic to what they want. When they are not insulting your work, you can get something like “I hate these colors” or “I want something fresh”. And even when it’s as simple as wanting more detail, the question remains on how much detail and at what point do they deem it as not having any meaning. This can help you go through the end of each level, where an art critic will show up to comment on one of your current paintings (as I never had an empty showcase, I’m sure they wait till you have at least one up for sale). When a customer actually likes a painting and buys it, nothing is more satisfying than seeing their little dance they do.As you work through the level, notifications will show up on the top left of the screen. It can be a notification of your bills, a bidding on a painting you have for sale, a critique/harsh comment on a painting, or newspaper headings. The newspaper headings are missable, but they do hold humor in them. Once you gain enough publicity, special  notifications will show up, such as Passpartout gaining popularity in the first level, someone “special” coming to visit, or a group of customers deciding not to come anymore. Though, I did get the same customers that said would not buy my paintings buy them. Knowing your customers will help you in the long run.You can specifically save a painting you worked on and loved as a screenshot, which opens up the screenshot area of the community forums toa nice area to share your in-game artwork. Though I do wish the paintings you already had out for sale followed you to your new place. I know that it may not exactly work out as you lose display spots as you rank up in popularity, but nothing is worse than working hard on a painting just for you to lose it as you continue to the next level. Especially when you just made it.I love the style they decided to take. It is very much like you are on a stage controlling a puppet. The music starts up, curtains opens, pleasant music greet you as customers enter and exit stage left or right. Than when you gain the ability to go to the next level, you hear disembodied clapping and muttering. You and the customers look like puppets as joints are ball joints and have a wood like texture for skin. Every different type of customer is dressed differently depending on what they like to buy. Fancy dressed women love detailed art while someone with a spiked mohawk love art with spirit and action. The sets you are given are also great to look at. You can always see the backdrop as the stage is decorated accordingly to where you are.There are multiple endings for you to explore, which I believe is decided to which style you leaned towards. If you favored drawing something simplistic, you will progress to a level where they mostly come in.

Encouraging drawings to be made by those who have no talent in art and those who do. This could've easily been a game where the more simplistic, the less it will sell. But instead added customers with a wide variety of tastes to ensure that anyone can complete the game. While it may be hard to decipher what the customer wants, it sure gives us a taste on how cryptic people can be in real life.💜💜💜Special thanks to the developer for letting me participate in the beta! 💜💜💜"

These were dark, minimalistic and I like things the way I like them.In the last few days i have listened to all critiques and discovered colour, painted from the heart, achieved expressionism and had so much fun in only 3 hours for my first playthrough.I've then gone on to enjoy learning who prefers cool or warm colours, who likes nature paintings, who loves bright bold shapes, playing with high energy paintings and rejecting bids to see who truly appreciates my style of art.Drawing a cartoon snake to find out my target client was disgusted by this but someone else thinks it's fantastic, really? Is it the colours or detail? I have no idea, so more experimenting is needed. This is fun.I've currently played 22 hours and seen only 3 endings so far and I haven't even visited every gallery location yet.

So that element of the game was completely irrelevant and unnecessary in my opinion.Could be improved if as well as paying rent, you could choose to spend your hard earned cash on additional colours, tools or canvas sizes? So maybe you could start with a very basic colour palette and have to upgrade it with cash. Alternatively maybe you could use your cash to buy advertising, or outfits for your character.

Yep, that's it. Oh, and clients that give constructive critisism so you know how to go down their path.About the paths, it is a nice way to have people 'explore' art. Different people like different things. The only reason I feel they implemented this is to try and force in a way to make it feel replayable.

This is a 'not recommend' unless you've got a 75% off sale or so.You know the premise: You draw stuff on a canvas with an MS Paint-like tool and AI characters buy it from you. The AI does a reasonably good job in identifying pictures. If you paint something that is similar to something you painted before, they'll pick up on it and call you unoriginal, for example.But your MS Paint tools are extremely limited. You've got a spray can, a paintbrush, and a pen tool that is laggy as hell. You've got a palette of 24 different colors, and that's it. Your canvas only takes up a third of the screen and you can't zoom in, so putting detail in a painting is really time consuming - like drawing with zoom at 25% or something.You can't save any painting. Once you sell one, it's lost forever.Passpartout is also very short. You can play for all the different endings I guess, but do most players actually do that in games unless they're going for achievements? For me, not enough happens in this game that would make me want to replay it like that.So this isn't an artist version of Rock Band or something like that, where you're encouraged to draw and practice and git gud. It's more like a decent mobile game with an interesting approach. It's not worth $10, more a 'decent mobile game ' price like $2.99."

,Recommended,582550,33473133,Posted: 11 July,all,Helping Hoof,"The game is a fresh take on painting simulations, where you are actually the painter yourself.It does not have a rotate option for the canvas, so all drawings have to be made in portrait.Even so, the game works with most drawing tablets and should allow most budding artists to create masterpieces.At the beginning of the game Passpartout only has access to a round painting tool which slaps 100% opaque paint onto the canvas.While the size of this tool can be adjusted, it forces the artist to look more in the direction of pointilism than much else.Resizing the drawing tool to the barest minimum allows for lines at the size of a mere pixel or two, which should be perfect for the more advanced artists among the game's playerbase.The potential buyers have their own group-preferences although individuals among them may get pulled toward specific drawings if they appear tantalizing to them, sometimes against expected group-preferences.You can slowly but surely adapt to their wishes, but they will abandon you if you repeat artstyles too much, and be very vocal about it.Once you make a name for yourself, more painting tools are made available, but the demands upon poor Passpartout will rise.The richer inhabitants of Paris leave little room for experimentation; they know what they like, and if you don't match their expectations they will complain to no end.With all the flak Passpartout gets from those who look but don't buy, it's no wonder he's got an addiction to liquor. ;)"

On the other hand, this keeps crashing after almost every act, making it very difficult to progress. I'm done repeating the same level for a few times in a row now, plus it's become kind of all the same thing at this point anyway. It's like making an afternoon of using MSPaint to varying degrees of skill and style, only to discard those images immediately after, but this has a better soundtrack.I wouldn't recommend purchasing this at this time, but with a few improvements and bug fixes it could actually be a good game."
,Recommended,582550,32354378,Posted: 11 June,all,I Respect Women :),"Passpartout: The Starving Artist,During my time playing this game I did enjoy myself quite a bit, If you are looking for a relaxing game to chill out and play by yourself this is a great game to do so with. There are countless paintings and ideas that you can make in the game to see how much they would sell for. I really felt as if the game catered to my needs in being a relaxing game as well.Pros:The game is very well made, during my time playing I did not experience any frame rate drops or technical issues with teh game.The art style is great, its almost as if your shop or place where you are painting is the centre stage, everywhere else is irrelevant and you can focus on the wonders that you can paint.The game aids relationships with the NPC's, believe it or not, it does. The game adds this wonderful sense of relationships to the game by making you cater to the needs of the NPC's that like your things that you know you can count on to buy a piece. I found my self commenting and getting excited when NPC's such as George or Don came to visit the shop and annoyed when NPC's such as the Hipsters or the Ladies came to visit.You don't have to be good at drawing, allthough it does help. I found myself actually improving on painting as I painted on, the countless ideas that I had in my head made me go though periods of churning out paintings that weren't good quality, I quickly realised this was not a good way to go about this and tried my hardest to produce painings that were being bought by the likes of George and Don. The main point is that you don't actually have to be good, the game still recognises when you have out effort into something and rewards you for that.Cons:It does get a bit repetitive, at times I felt myself running out of ideas in my head which is when your paintings don't sell. Its definutely a game you can't play for hours on end but rather play once a day or week for about an hour, I think that coming into the game with a headfull of ideas is a good way to go about it.From what I see, there isn't much in the way of progress during the game, Yes you do get different venues or 'levels' and you do get some new tools, but there isn't much in the way of really progressing, the new level is just a reprint of the last with the oppurtunity to get more money for the same type of paintings. If it weren't for the fact that different areas bring different NPC's and new artwork ideas, I think I would have got really bored really quick.It doesn't quite get there. The idea of this game is really really good, but it can be so much more, if they had more mechanics and features such as talking to the NPC's or engaging in this such as auctions or even asking the NPC's what kind of paintings they liked to get a better idea of what to paint would be great. Things like a store would be perfect, I don't know if I have reached far enough to spend the money I have accumulated and I shall definutely play more but I feel if there was a shop where you could buy items and customise the areas you were in, this would aid the game a lot by adding this depth to it.Final Verdict:For the price it's at now, I would say buy it. it's a new experience not really seen in other games that is generally fun. For £6 (Price at Purchase) I have enjoyed this game and look forward to coming at it in the coming days with new fresh ideas. If however you are looking for a game to sink hours into, i wouldn't say this is the one, it's not that type of game and I can see some people getting really bored really quick.Feel free to add me and message me on steam for anymore questions about the game.Updates:After playing the game for no more than 3 hours, I had already completed it, I still recommend it as you can continue past this point but after that there isn't much in terms of story and it's a bit bare bonned. If the Devs can manage to continue and update the game with added levels I would be appreciated and needed to be worth the full price. At the moment it seems a bit lackluster and is more of a demo than a full game."

There will be people who dislike this game which I understand, same goes to the folks who like it. When I first started playing this game, it was pretty fun. But after about an hour plus or so, it really gets boring. For starters the amount of colours aren't alot, and you're stuck with the same colours. Secondly, the tools are very little. And thirdly, you can't always draw what you like due to the customers as they may not buy them and you'll have incoming bills that deducts the cash you have. And the bills dont stop, I get this part because they're trying to make a realistic approach. Honestly, this isn't a bad game like I said, it's just that it could've been much more. And for the price, it isn't really worth it honestly. I would advice general gamers to wait for this game to go on sale, right now it's not worth the price tag. If you really, really have interest in art, get it. Otherwise, it'll be boring overtime and lacks luster."

I very much enjoy it when games motivate me to be creative in some way, because I never get started otherwise. This game is great at exactly that, and no matter your skill level (ZERO in my case), you'll be able to create something fun.Fair warning: The customers are not always easy to read. They'll give you some feedback to indicate what they like, but you wont always know what to do with that information - how to translate it into a painting they'll want to buy.The game is VERY easy on you though, so just do your own thing, and don't sweat it if a few paintings fail to impress the potential customers (A.K.A. PHILISTINES!)."
,Recommended,582550,32327055,Posted: 10 June,all,Noblesdown,"Cute, but limited and slightly frustrating. You paint the paintings a la microsoft paint, but you will quickly run out of ability to make ""new"" ideas with the extremely limited toolset you have (you unlock more tools, but only a few and slowly, and you still won't have enough to do complex works). After so many circles with line squiggles or poorly attempted landscapes or stick figures, you'll be like, ""Oh man, I have to make another painiting and I've done everything I can think of.""To make it worse, there is a pattern to what certain art critics / customers buy, but I've had little luck finding consistency in their choices. Someone will buy a painting, yet reject another that was made almost in the same way. I'm personally stuck on Act 2, and have only been able to sell 3 paintings no matter what approach I take.That said, the game is polished, charming and does what it set out to do well, and is an amusing diversion for short bursts for a while. This isn't soething you'll get dozens of hours of play out of, but if you want to mindlessly burn a half hour while scratching some creative itching, it's a nice offering particularly at its price point.If you want to check out a good example of gameplay, I'd head over to Jesse Cox on YouTube to watch his try- he goes through more than enough to show the nature of all the gameplay (and is hysterical in his typical fashion."

And at the very end it didn't even show all of my art that I made which was also disappointing.

In the end I settled on a poisitive review but with a disclaimer.I'll start off with the bad. This is essentially MS Paint with achievements. And while it is much more fun than it sounds, that's still what it is. There is little to no gameplay between painting one painting and the next. You paint and paint and then paint some more. And inevitably this leads to your creative juices running dry until you find yourself painting low-effort abstract paintings wondering what you're doing with your life.However, it's not all bad. There's a lot to like here.For one thing, it's undoubtably a novel idea. It's something I hadn't seen in a game before and I always appreciate fresh approaches to video games. For another, the critiquing of the NPCs who buy your paintings is surprisingly accurate. They will comment on the rushed nature of a painitng, it's simplicity and it's lack or abundance of colours and they do so with impressive consistency.All-in-all, the amount of fun you will have with this game depends on how you approach it. If you play for the sake of progressing like you would many other games you will quickly find yourself bored. However, if you use this as a way to gamify your doodles and stop playing the minute you have no more inspiration to draw on, coming back to it when the mood strikes you, then I reckon you will have a good time with this."

Overall, while the game is good, I don't think the price justifies the playing time. Most people will only play this to 1 ending which will only be 2 hours - as after that, it gets repetitive, so the game is definitely not worth $10 for only 2 hours, and even if you do all 4 endings (8 hours max.), it's still not worth $10, and little people will go for all 4 unless they're a completionist type.

But I am going to recommend this game because I like the gameplay (even though it's kinda just like MS paint). I really hope Flamebait Games are going to make it longer.

Then you realise your using a mouse and you can't draw at all so you arrange some dots in a vauge attempt to be the new wave or something. Punks hate it, hipsters want to buy it for nothing but the old guys love it. You sell it with the title ""filling in the void"" and ponder if you need to go the a writing class as the old geeser walks off with it. Little do you care about an hour later as you are plastered on wine and chewing a baguette that the stupid dots picture bought you while you stare at the garage wall you call a ""mordern loft apartment"" to the unsuspecting girl you are trying to chat up.All in all I feel this game is pretty neat.

If you don't like doodling for hours in Microsoft Paint this is not the game for you.  If you do like doodling for hours in Paint you should save your money and do that instead.The object of the game is to earn money with your paintings but there is no rhyme or reason to the comments that the patrons make about your painting.  You can draw a very detailed painting and someone says ""It's a copy"", or you can draw a stick figure and someone will call it a ""masterpiece"".Later in the game you can choose to work for a company, but there is no instruction from the company in terms of what they want.  You are given an office and that's it, also it's kind of weird that the 'baguette' guy is selling bread on the 34th floor.Passpartout has no real depth past the doodling and at the 3rd hour I was wanting something different to do in the game.

As soon as you have tried all the techniques and the 3 different tools (only 3 !), you just empty your gauge of inspiration and there is not much left in the game after that.I really think it can be improved with a few tips or more close-to-user speech from the people walking arround the paintings.In the end, the game seems unfinished and I've spoted a few bugs that can confirm that.

It gets stale extremely quick. There has to be some sort of goal, some drawing requests/objectives. For example, maybe have people come up and request art from you, and if you deliver what they want, they pay you well. Or maybe in the news popups (which are currently very useless and not entertaining) they instead add a news section where you can see what kind of art is in style, and if you make it they sell easily.Really it just needs more gameplay elements.

While this game makes awesome humor in just the stupid things you can draw, when the humor runs dry and the game ends, there's no reason to play again for a few days or even weeks.The limitting amount of tools makes this go dry faster. It's essentially Microsoft Paint with even less tools. While these limiters can be funny, such as the lack of an eraser, the inclusion of more tools besides a paintbrush, a spray can, and a slow paint brush would have been welcome. Perhaps a paint bucket tool to make things faster.Overall, when you first open the game, it's a great time. Past the first playthrough, not so much. My first playthrough was around three hours, but I've heard people going as low as 90 minutes. If you think it's worth $10, have at it. you'll have a great time, especially with friends. Because I had a fantastic time playing, filled with laughter, I can say that the short time I did play was worth a hefty price tag, but not everyone will agree. Wait for a sale."

Each character liked a certain thing. Going on, I got better and better studios and brushes. There were only three brushes though, but all worked out.At the end it showed all the art I ever created, and a nice dialouge despite the rest of the game was silly criticism. It made me feel happy. The first time getting into act 2, I was forgotten unfortunately. So I restarted, I may plan on finding the next ending.Also, this game really helped me with giving dramatic feels to the painting. And even drawing random things works, not just what you like. Even a simple earth was worth 6000.In Conclusion, ""Passpartout is a good effort."""

Especially when it meant getting the sellout ending. If the negative comments from patrons were at least helpful or maybe if there was a dialog box explaining what each character is looking for that would have helped but even then it literally hurt my hand to play this game. I'm the type of person that wants a game I don't want to put down, not one that makes my eyes glaze in less than two hours. I played it over two nights and was bored during over half the gameplay. Plus since I haven't seen my wacom tablet in years because moving I was forced to use a mouse and my hand started cramping, not to mention what I can do with a mouse is basically nothing unless I wanted to spend way too long working on detail with 4 tools one of which I still don't know how to access it or what even it is. It looked like fun on youtube but now I know that was just editing and that Jazza is an amusing fellow. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I'd had my tablet but it is just a very tedious and boring game. I figured I'd do one platythrough normal and one Jazza mode but if it's isn't worth that, I should have returned it the first night but I was trying to give it a fair shot."

,Recommended,582550,32520226,Posted: 17 June,all,Defy | cranberries,"This game is MS Paint: Story Mode as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However in my eyes, MS Paint has a lot more to offer, no story, characters, or money, but tools and color options. Per se, you get order a Big Mac at McDonald's, but they give you a regular cheeseburger.One slice of beef. One slice of cheese. One thin layer of lettuce. All between two plain buns absent of sesame seeds.Still a burger, a good one at that, this game is really relaxing but infuriating because the Punks in the beginning are so difficult to meet standards with. Personally, I've mastered the craft of appealing to every other character, like the ladies, investors, businessmen, hipsters, baguette man, etc.It might not be worth $10, probably $5, but you'll still be glad  because there are multiple endings and you can never run out of creative fuel with this game.You can come up with your own patterns, draw those swords you drew in 4th grade when you were bored in class,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥All the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ But don't stop there, if you check the screenshot gallery in the community hub, not only will you be amazed by the anime characters and memes, but you will also feel ashamed for being garbage at MS Paint.Happy painting."

76561198091948174,Recommended,582550,32468086,Posted: 16 June,all,page,"It was tough to figure out whether this should get thumbs up or down. What contents there is is fun, but there is not much here and it feels expensive considering the limitations. This is a full release as far as I can see, but I hope there will be exansions as this feels like there's not much gameplay for the price. I ended up going with a recommendation as I do want to see this evolve rather than fail.ProsOn the one hand, it is a visually interesting game. The visual style is nice and suits the mood. The sound design is mostly good as well, especially the snobbish ""blabla-blah"" of the high-end clients. The first few paintings are a lot of fun. It lends a real feeling of thoroughness to see the painter working in the background in real time as the painting is made. Watching people criticise it and eventually buy it was also fun. I'm unsure as to what criteria are used, but mostly the ones I threw up in seconds did not sell, so they seem to be fair. The first time you advance in your career is a real feeling of accomplishment, although it might have happened anyway, no matter how badly I was doing.ConsIt gets old fast. As I said, the first few paintings were fun, but the limtations of the painting tools really made themselves felt around number four or five. At first, this seemed like it would be fixed as you can unlock new tools, but there were only two more to come and so your work does not evolve. The first advancement was a feeling of accomplishment, but after that, my thought was ""oh. Just the same thing again in a different environment"". For the second advencement, there weren't even any new tools unlocked, so it was just a change of scenerey. At this time, I was making the same garbage as I had in the beginning, but now the snobs were paying a hundred times more for it. This might be intentional, as the artist's name is at least as important as the quality of the work, but it still felt weird that there were no new tools or higher expectations. At this point, the ending came out of nowhere."

Instead, I was delighted to discover there's some strategy to it -- namely, discovering the types of paintings your clients like. The characters are hilarious, the various endings are entertaining. It's a fun game if you want to goof around and just laugh for a while. I thought I was only going to play it for about 30 minutes. Ended up playing it for hours. This is a keeper for me -- I doubt I'll uninstall it for a while.A recent update added the ability to haggle over the price of your paintings. Very cool. I hope the developers keep updating it with more tools, colors and added details.The only cons to this game (at least in my book): The characters can get a little repetitive -- I'd love a little more variety. Also, one goal of the game is to sell enough paintings to pay your bills, but it's so easy to do this, it's barely even a thing. I'd love for this aspect to be a little more competitive -- faster incoming bills or larger bills or something. At its current rate, I can leisurely work on a ""masterpiece"" through several bill cycles without worrying about my bank account.Much thanks to Jacksepticeye for turning me on to this game. His YT video is hilarious -- check it out for laughs and a better idea of what this game is about.

The tools are simplistic.  I like the addition of new tools as you go, it would be nice if there one or two more.  I think a blend tool would do wonders.  It's fun arguing with the patrons as they bid on or critique your work.  You get a download function to save anything you have created, you just have to remember to use it.  I don't know if your skill actually has anything to do with the sales, but from the videos I've seen, at minimum the time spent on them does.  As I have sold for over $8,000E in the second act.  Each act has it's own unique music, style, and new patrons, but the gameplay remains the same.  I haven't finished just yet, but I plan to.  This is a fun game, and I enjoy any game based around art.Let's Play - Part 3https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz4_kK5tg-Q"

Relaxing because of the painting mechanic, the wonderful music, and the joy of creating art works. Stressful because of the darn customers who harshly judge your hard work AND HAVE NOT A LICK OF TASTE...sorry. But seriously, this game is wonderful and thoughtful. Once you realise what the different kinds of customers like, then it becomes easier to paint to their preferences, make a sale, and progress to the next stage.It's meaningful, entertaining, wonderful."

,Recommended,582550,33912556,Posted: 30 July,all,Chef Rude,"This is not a serious artistic game, it's more of a puzzle game that allows you to draw with your mouse.It's not super long but does have replay value. The characters are hilarious through repetitive. The critical style adapts to your artistic style.Enjoyed it, and the soundtrack helps with setting a mood.Multiple endings, fun to experiment. You are rewarded for a variety of things, and if you take your time, hopefully the people looking at your art notice, but if you do doodles, you can still get a lot of fun out of it."
