,Recommended,582620,29947436,Posted: 15 February,all,JulianR94,"Disclaimer:It is not entirely clear to me if this game is in early access or full release state. As you can see by the release date, which says 1st of July2016, it is a bit confusing. I want to assume that this is merely a typo and 1st of July 2017 is what they actually meant to write there. However, still, there is no EA marker. But then again, the version number is 1.2.4 if I recall correctly. You can see why I am a bit confused...So yeah, treat this with a grain of salt. I'm fairly sure all of this is because the devs and the publisher seem to be very new to the scene, Copoka being their first game published on Steam. Regardless, I believe some clarification is desperately needed here.Also, the fact that aController is strongly recommendedshould also be stated on the store page.Update:Alright, I figured it out. The game exists since July 2016, apparently, but has only now been released on Steam. This also makes sense, of course. So, the game is not in early access and has been fully released now on Steam.__________My first impressions:Copoka really is unique, and that in many ways.The ability to play as a bird and freeroam in the skies or on the ground was the main reason I've decided to give it a shot, but there is a bit more to this game than just flying around and experiencing a city from a bird's perspective. However, at the same time, not too much more either. That is not to say the game doesn't offer a lot for its price, ultimately.Make no mistake, this game is more of a laidback ""zen session"" than an actual game in the classic sense, something you want to beat. Sure, there are goals. There are ""collectibles"" and ""upgrades"". But I do not believe these are the things you necessarily want to exclusive go after when playing.Your goal is to find various objects in this world to add to your nest and enhance it, so called ""trinkets"", such as a broken glasses frame or a bottleneck. Trinkets will be highlighted and are rather easily visible when you're high up and looking around. Having picked up a trinket, your nest will be marked in yellow and enables you to easily find your way back. Once you have collected 5 trinkets, you will progress to the next ""set"" of trinkets to collect. And with that, you will progress in the story.Yes, a story, and I will come to this later.While collecting the trinkets you can also collect up to 11 feathers which will permanently upgrade your speed to actually significant levels. I have only collected 2 or 3 feathers in my playtime and felt a nice increase. Soaring through the sky is a lot more fun with a few speed upgrades, that I will definitely say.The aesthetic is very intriguing, reminding me a bit of Mirror's Edge in the sense that most buildings are very simplistic, boring even, and colored in white. In stark contrast to that, however, is the lush environment around with colors of all sorts. Your bird is rather realistic-looking, too, in very stark contrast to the humans, which coupled with the nice animations while flying really adds to the sense of surreality. And then, of course, you have really beautiful music playing along, which can just as well be abruptly interrupted by military chanting over extremely loud speakers as you get close to the city hall.It should be evident that this game is all about drawing you into a totalitarian world, beautiful to a bird when looked at from the sky, but horrible when on the ground and close to sick and fearful humans. You do have a choice which of these you want to experience, though, and this is a very good thing. You are a bird, after all. You can fly anywhere you want.Finally, there is indeed even a story of sorts involved. A story which might very well come as expected from a game that features such a totalitarian state. But also one that might very well surprise you. It certainly did surprise me, and I felt compelled to listen closely and observe the changes the lands were going through.Yet, as I mentioned above, it is not forced upon you. That is a really good thing, and now that I have ""beaten"" the game after about an hour, I honestly want to do a second playthrough at some point where I will try to listen to every conversation. Surprisingly enough, it should be noted, the voice acting is actually not terrible. It isn't even bad. It's... quite decent, at times good even. Though I suppose that goes to show there is a good amount of love in this project.If that sounds interesting to you, then yes, by all means, support this little indie product. It offers on point value/money right now, and I can only hope that a few more additions and improvements will be made in the future. If not, hell, it's still a really neat little game.__________Speaking of improvements, here are a few things I would like to criticize in hope that they will be improved:Performance seems to be fairly decent on my system (Max/""Beautiful"" graphics at 1080p). I run a 4.6GHz i7-6700k, 16GB of high-speed DDR4 RAM and an overclocked GTX 970, outputting to a 72Hz monitor.However, despite the game being locked to 60fps, it cannot always maintain this and drops to around 45-40fps at times, though chances are you will not notice this all too much, as the game otherwise runs smoothly and is relatively chill and relaxed in the first place. Regardless, this is a bit weird, as it seems to run in the Unreal Engine and certainly does not offer the graphical fidelity to justify those drops.But, keep in mind, it's not outright terrible to begin with. The game clearly works well, for the biggest part, which is why I am only mentioning this to point out the room and need for improvement, but also to make potential buyers who want their performance to be rock-solid and completely stable aware of it. If you are such a person, you might want to wait a bit.Other than performance, the interface needs a little bit of polish, in my opinion. While you are able to choose between a standard and a more snappy control method, rebindable buttons and keys would be nice. Now, I chose the snappy control method, as it offers nice and pretty responsive control over your bird. But, despite the game claiming you will be able to change this at any time, you cannot actually do so without starting a new game. Either that or I'm really oblivious, but I haven't been able to find such an option anywhere else but at the start of a new game.Lastly, I feel like the tutorial should be a tiny little bit more helpful. It will teach you how to take off, accelerate and break, but that is pretty much it. You could argue that this really is all you need, and I agree to some extent, but there are three more buttons bound. One you hold down to teleport back to your nest, and the other two for doing a birdcall. But I do not know if doing a birdcall actually does anything useful.All of these things are, in my opinion, rather minor but should be noted regardless.__________I hope this extensive review helped you as a consumer in making a decision whether or not to support this game, and also the devs to polish it up a little more. :)"
,Recommended,582620,30002607,Posted: 17 February,all,X Drake,"I love this game. Really put emotions in my heart.I've been dreaming, begging, even for more bird-games. Maybe I'm a pretty niche customer in this regard. I just adore the sensation of getting to fly around and explore of my own control.Overall, the controls feel great. I love flying and swooping and diving, I love the sound design, especially the rustling of leaves when you dive through trees. It feels great, everything about this game feels great.I wish, a little, that there was more content in some regards-- things to collect, conversations to listen in on, stuff like that. But for a game that's regularly $5 (and I bought it on sale for $4), I can't complain. This is just a lovely little piece of work for its price, and I plan to play it more in the future despite having finished the 'story', just to relive the sensation of flying."
,Recommended,582620,33026583,Posted: 30 June,all,Sloria,"As mentioned before this game needs some optimization, but it's a cute, relaxing game telling the story of an enslaved society from a bird's view which has the freedom to roam around the whole city and listen to the sorrows. Collecting the twigs and feathers for the bird might get boring since the map is big and you will probably miss some places, but overall it's worth it since there's a social progress in each chapter which creates an interesting plot."

,Recommended,582620,32769085,Posted: 25 June,all,LonM,"Very nice short game. Plays similar to a walking sim style, with the story simply told passively as you explore the environment. Exploring the story also grants you the required collectibles to progress forwards.Nice art style, and design of the environment matches well with the story. The story itself is interesting, as you follow an oppressed people, but you can't influence it in any way. Good soundtrack. Game had some (minor) framerate & shadow issues."

Despite the simplicity, I found myself becoming so attached to the characters and the world that it was almost sad when it was over.  The soundtrack is absolutely breathtaking, as are the visuals and the storytelling.  The only real issue I had was bad optimization (Low FPS, freezes, crashes, etc) when flying above denser areas.  9/10."

,Recommended,582620,29961940,Posted: 16 February,all,Mtkiddy,"Interesting game, reminds me of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, due to the fact that it is heavily story based, exploration, and little to do but discover the story and build a nest. With this being said, however, it is a fun and intriguing game. So far I have played through the first little chapter, I guess it would be called a chapter. I do have one little gripe, however, before starting to play I went into settings and changed the camera to be inverted, though when starting the game, the controls were not inverted. I went into the options mid-game and changed it back, but I could not go far enough down to save the settings, I am playing with an Xbox 360 controller. I had to go back to the main menu and change it. When I reloaded the game, my movement, left analog stick, was correct, but my camera, right analog stick, was incorrect. Therefore, I play with correct movement, and try not to move the camera too much.Here is a video playthrough of the first little chapter.https://youtu.be/N2MX2AbIOCg"

It's nice to fly around as a bird, which has some nice actions to perform.There is some stuff that could be improved to make the game better, which I will place in the discussion forum. But I certainly felt entertained while playing Copoka."

If you like casual indie games you'll probably like this.If it was $10 it wouldn't be worth it, but because it's less than $5, I recommend trying it out. Here's my gameplay video if you want to check it out before purchasing:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BTKqCpf3tg&feature=youtu.be"

I have tried every solution I could find to no avail, so will be returning my copy. If ever it is less buggy, I hope to buy and try it again."

76561198274533575,Recommended,582620,30026045,Posted: 18 February,all,dva's waifu,"Really reccomend this game! I love the great and HUGE attention to detail in this game, and the graphics are BEAUTIFUL and just flat out AMAZING! Copoka is defintley a good buy, and impressve as well.The games gives me a very good 'Fly like a Bird' vibe ( A Gamevial game ) except being extremley polished ( And actually good! ), a great nostalgic feeling for me as it was a 'childhood' game.One thing that I mentioned before that Id like to expand on is the attention to detail, its awesome! Having your wing glide across a tree makes the sound of calm leaves rustling, you can fly close and listen in on the towns people speak to eachother and share feelings/opinions, at area near the lighthouse you can hear other birds,etc,  its just...stunning!-Maybe one thing Id like to see in the future if more objectives and goals of the game. The main purpose is to collect shiny trinkets/feahers which boosts things like your speed and adding upon your nest, but it feels like it needs more. In the previous game I mentioned before ( 'Fly like a Bird' ), although the game isnt that great, it had more than just nest building. You could interact with other birds ( even if in a single player mode on the newer versions that sadly arent avaliabe any more ) and pooping on the human NPCs. Im not saying Id like to see exactly that in future updates to the game, but maybe a little more 'mmph' could be added along side the nest objective! I can understand if you're thinking ""Uh, no that wouldnt make any sense"" because the eavsdropping totally makes up for that as you unfold the story of the city below, and follow a storyline as you attempt to find all of the twigs/trinkets. :) I found it very entertaining to listen to everybody speak and share their own opinions. Maybe some interactions? ( By the way, NPC styles are very adorable! )Overall...I REALLY enjoyed this game and I give it a very high 11/10! The graphics are amazing, the soundtrack and attention to detail is extremeley stunning, and Its a good time killer and a stress reliever too. Simple, fun, and calming. 3 best words I like to hear in a game like this. Defintley worth the $4.99."
