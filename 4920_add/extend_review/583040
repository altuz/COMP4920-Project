I've been a long time princess maker fan and I never dreamed of a official English translation of the original Princess Maker! Thank you very much, CFK .Since the game was originally released in 1991, it's rather rustic and very numbers and text based, but it's still a fun time sink. It's great having a window of the game open while you do other things like chatting and browsing the web... Every true parent knows how to multi-task, am i rite!This game is not pornographic at all, but there are some awkward nudity scenes (there were no swinsuits back then, I guess), so be careful playing this in public... or if you don't want any nudity, you can wait for Princess Maker 3,4, 5, these are cleaner and more sfw."

Compared to its successor, Princess Maker may seem trimmed down and is definitely more easy to play but it's an awesome experience and a fun addition to the already released PM2. The initial translation is also much improved. This game (Along with its successors) is highly addictive with INSANE replay value. I also really liked PM1's art, it's super adorable. Definitely recommended. And let's be real, we're all waiting for PM3-5 to come out after this.A++++++"
76561198334668214,Recommended,583040,30021012,Posted: 18 February,all,Bakadesusenpai,"Honestly, right away you can tell this is the first and arguably, weakest game in the series. But the game laid the groundwork for the better, future games of the franchise. I enjoyed learning about and experiencing this game more than seriously playing it.That aside, the translation is (as expected) rough and text wrapping could use some work. Princess Maker 2 is a significantly better and easier to follow game so if you were to choose beteen the two, I'd choose PM2, any day of the week, as PM2 has aged well, as opposed to the original, which hasn't in some aspects.Ultimately, I'd recommend this for those interested in experiencing the roots of the series, or die-hard fans. For those that don't really know what they are getting into... I would recommend Princess Maker 2, or waiting for the release of the other games in the series."
76561198062406756,Recommended,583040,30069461,Posted: 20 February,all,Halkett,"As a fan of the Princess Maker series and it's western spiritual successors (Cute Knight, Long Live the Queen), I largely bought this as a curiosity to kill time and hopefully encourage the translation of PM 3-5. That's where the series gets really interesting. As a piece of gaming history, it is amusing enough but hasn't aged overly well. If you're interested in the PM series, Princess Maker 2 is hands down the better place to start.Gameplay consists of scheduling three classes/work placements for you daughter each month between the ages of 10 - 18. These placements then increase or decrease a selection of stats, with the goal of balancing these and developing your daughter into a successful adult (or not, as the case may be). For example, if you send your daughter off to work as a Hunter expect her Dexterity to rise, but her Glamour to crash. There is also the chance to send your daughter off adventuring in the wilderness, complete with simplistic RPG combat. Unlike PM2 your general success in the various ending seem to be tied to her Reputation as opposed to individual stats.Pros compared to Princess Maker 2+ Prettier and more varied artwork. While Maria's dresses don't come with stat changes she does get 4 free dresses everytime she ages. I also enjoyed seeing the shifting village landscape through the window behind her to depict the season changes.+ Larger adventuring area. Though this is just one single large area as opposed to four distinct biomes, but presented an interesting challenge the first few times through.+ Less moody daughter. PM2 expanded a number of the daughter's stats, some of which affected her temperament causing her to be unresponsive. For new players Princess Maker offers a slightly easier introduction to the stat raising genre as some of these additional triggers are absent.Cons compared to Princess Maker 2- Disappointing lack of 'mysteries'. One of my favourite aspects of PM2 was discovering things like the fairy at the oasis or fighting the ghost in the graveyard. This aspect is completely absent.- Combat is HARD. Like I'm sitting at 400 stamina, 280 strength and 250 dex and pretty good equipment. I'm having almost as much trouble adventuring then I did when I had half those. There seems to be a high element of luck involved.- There's quite a lot of nudity in the CGs. This normally doesn't really bother me (hey, I'm european) but it seems a bit excessive. It's not even the vacation images, but the random topless rivals in the Harvest Tournament that seem completely gratutious.- Text weirdly disjoints itself inside the text box creating distracting broken typos.- No Cube or rival girls. The game feels a bit lonely in comparison."
,Recommended,583040,30080039,Posted: 21 February,all,nin,"PM2 is a lot better. If you haven't played it, go try that first. That said, there are a few good aspects to this game even in comparison to its much better sequel.As a fair warning, it has a decent amount of frontal nudity. They occur during summer vacation, and winter vacation after the age of 15. In addition, some of the female enemies in the Battle Tournament are also nude.Pros+Gameplay is much faster+Daughter's hair style is less 80's+A ton of dresses, though they are all aesthetic and based on age+Protagonist is still mostly faceless, but he's a bit more likable because he chose to raise orphans rather than get a child from the gods+A few of the endings are more badass in comparison to similar endings in PM2+Half the priceCons-Harder to get used to without a guide-No animations-Battle system is very RNG heavy. Losing to opponents that should be a lot weaker than you happens on occasion, and running away from weaklings happens way more than it should.-No rivals, and no Cube-Only one place to explore, albeit a large one-Sickness is way more detrimental than it should be-Way fewer endings-Your daughter can't get married and have a job at the same time unlike in PM2In any case, even with its many flaws, fans of PM2 may find some enjoyable aspects in this game and help support the release of other Princess Maker games in the process."

Well, it ain't for everyone, but of course I was all over this, that said...pm1 is the weakest game in the series gameplay wise, what with the white wolves level rng insanity, cruddier rpg segment. and more simplistic stat set up, that said, plenty of dress up opportunities, since while she only has 4 outfits, they change with every birthday, still a reasonable array of endings, sure it isn't as high as later games in the series, but there's a decent array, and items need to be used for their effects to kick in...which may not seem like much, however as someone who's filled my poor daughters inventory to the point her guardian steps in and tells me I really don't need that item I wanted to buy her in pm2, the inventory optimizer in me is glad all those dolls I bought for her stress aren't biting me in the♥♥♥♥♥♥here, sure, it's not the best game in the series, but it was a start, and while it hasn't aged the best mechanically, for what it is it was a good start,besides...Maria is best daughter, buy this for Maria~"

The voices can get annoying if you are grinding for money or a certain stat.You are a father (why not a mother?) who saved the world or something and you adopt a kid. You have give her work and compet in competitions. How your daughter turns out is due to your choices and ations. She can be from someone important to just a nobody.And no there is having sex with her, a lot of people ask that a lot for some reason."

I just felt like I was spending too much time trying to get her healthy again, and the stats were just not moving or your money because she just doesn't do anything if she's not fit/rebellious. It felt like an infinate loop so there was no fun in it for me at all."

76561198036393876,Not Recommended,583040,30092248,Posted: 21 February,all,The Grand Mugwump,"Princess maker is basically a game about raising numbers to get certain endings based on those numbers.  If you're the type who likes playing with numbers to see how it changes the character, combat, and the endings, this series is probably your cup of tea.  Unfortunately Princess Maker Refine 1 has very, very little to offer in one of the most crucial parts of this kind of game, story.  There are no events or changes to the story for doing anything in any order so long as you end the game with certain numbers.+The art is cute- But it has a few NSFW scenes (Maybe a + if you're into girl hentai?)+ The overall story is interesting.  A national hero who became crippled after fighting off the demon king decides to help raise the next generation.  I really liked the true queen ending.- There is almost no story between the beginning intro and the ending.-Combat is extremely frustrating and -very- reliant on RNG.  No matter how skilled your daughter is, she will always have a % chance every turn to panic and flee from battle against even the weakest opponents, and critical strikes will end almost all battles instantly.? This game has no guides or instructions to it, staying true to children having no instruction manual.  Be sure to read a guide if you want to succeed.? This game was worth 2 serious playthroughs and a fast, joke playthrough for me.  The last one still felt like a chore even though I tried to keep it quick.Overall I do not recommend this game simply because Princess Maker Refine 2 does everything better for a slightly higher price tag.On its own merits, I guess if you want a really simple game with eye candy, then knock yourself out."

I'm kind of shocked it made it onto Steam at all with that in the game. It's super nasty and I hope they patch it out because yikes."

This was very jarring and ruined my immersion and experience. I will not be purchasing any other princess maker titles from this developer because of the shameful (DISGUSTING!) presentation. I will warn all other potential buyers that this game has literally naked children. Shame on your GABEN for RUINING STEAM.
