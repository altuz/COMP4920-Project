But sometimes the passengers have special needs, or the map has something weird about it. Some levels that seem easy at first glance are actually quite tricky!This has great game and puzzle design and the sound and graphics are charming. I had a small hiccup on launch day with graphics settings, but a quick patch from the devs fixed it! Would buy again."

Then I need to deliver them here ... no wait there ... wait, THERE?! How do I even get there?!I'll try this other level instead. Maybe it'll be easier. Oh hey, these levels have crossing tracks. That'll make puzzles so much easier! <15 minutes later> HOW IS EVERYTHING HARDER NOW?! Who even DOES THIS?!My brain hurts. Buy the game and share in my head pain."

In the likes of Snake Bird and Jelly No Puzzle, this pikatchu colored, decitefully sweet puzzler conceals some of the most elegant puzzle designs I've seen so far. Altough it can be said that some levels are difficult to complete, they all present a clear and intuitive way to be resolved  if approached systematically. The game introduces several variations to it's core mechanics and manages not to feel repetitive despite it's 120 levels. Given that you can expect around 20 to 25 hours to complete the whole thing (add some more hours if you do wish to tackle the bonus levels), the 10$ price tag is pretty much a joke."

76561198007366378,Recommended,583270,30593932,Posted: 18 March,all,nubok,"When I looked at the trailer I was a little doubtful whether this really is a game for me, although this game is from the same people as ""A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build"", which I really like(d): I personally love puzzle games, but the trailer reminded me of Mini Metro, which is clearly of a different genre. Summarisingly I can say: It clearlyisa puzzle game and if you liked ""A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build"", you can worrilessly just buy ""Cosmic Express"" (the other direction also holds). Also the ""artistic feeling"" is very related: Both games are of similar cute style and also have the similarity that if you click on some objects in the game, you will get a ""cute"" reaction. Additionally the difficulty level of the puzzles between these two games feels very similar to me.For those who feel out of the loop when reading the previous paragraph, here is a description of ""Cosmic Express"": You have to lay down a rail track that must not cross itself in a grid in a glass sphere. When you start the train, it picks up aliens, which will leave the train as soon as they are next to their destination. Just look at the trailer and you will immediately understand. Instructions are hardly given, but the levels design is sufficiently good that these are also not really necessary. At the beginning complications mostly arise from the fact that the train has only few (at the beginning 1 or 2) wagons, so that you have to plan ahead. Just as in ""A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build"" you will typically have multiple levels that you can play at any time, so that if you are stuck somewhere, you can just change the level to a different one. I could write some things about complications and interesting things that arise in the game, but I really don't want to spoil you the fun of finding this out yourself. I admit that at the beginning I was a little doubtful whether from such simple principles one can create interesting levels, but be assured: The level designers did a good job here.So if you don't like puzzle games, don't buy this. ;-) If you like relaxing and cute puzzle games, you will surely love ""Cosmic Express"" (and ""A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build"", too). On the other hand: If you are a brainiac hardcore puzzle game enthusiast, you might find this game too easy (and go for example for games by Steven Lavelle/increpare games). For my part a clear recommendation.For the price: The current price of 9,99€ is, I think, a fair price for what the game delivers."
,Recommended,583270,34387993,Posted: 20 August,all,BunnyLizard,"Don't mistake this cute, colorful game as just another easy/mindless puzzle game.The game combines the style of various train games (Train Valley) with theDark Soulsmentality of ""git gud"", and while a strange combination, it works. Somehow. Even when my brain refused to work and actuallysolve the damn puzzles.Not for the faint of heart. It's a struggle, the kind where it lures you in with cute little aliens and then shoves you down a flight of stairs known as the""difficulty curve"". But I love it for that too. Even when I was pulling out my hair and ready to snap the keyboard.Expect your money's worth of hours in this puzzle game. It took me about 20 hours. At times, while cursing a level, I considered reviewing this as ""Not Recommended"" because I was mad at the devs for hurting me with their evil puzzles. But I'm not the brightest mind, either. Good to come back to time and time again to solve just one more level - and the sense ofreliefeuphoria you get when you solve a particularly tricky one is an added bonus!"
,Recommended,583270,30601031,Posted: 18 March,all,lexprod,"another great game from this team: Alan's understanding of how to take simple tile based rules and quickly bend your mind, giving you a problem that looks JUST one square out of reach, and then you twist and turn the tracks until finally you go OH wait...DUH. This, like ""a good snowman"" has a good helping of ""simple"" levels before it starts to turn the screws, and unlike mega-tough stephen's sausage roll (which I still love) none of the escalations seem too obscure or complex to handle. Plus you can just play with mouse while watching something else!"
76561197986955769,Recommended,583270,33082206,Posted: 1 July,all,Bloody Spy!,"Buy it ONLY if you want a real mental challenge.People looking for a nice, relaxing, and casual puzzle experience will most likely find only frustration here. The wonderfully cute and brightly-coloured characters belie the surprisingly fiendish difficulty that lies beneath. This is not a game for kids or casuals! (you have been warned)Cosmic Express is basically a line puzzle game, but one in which you have to pick up cute little aliens and deliver them to their correct destination. E.g. purple aliens need to be taken to purple houses, and orange aliens have to go to their orange-coloured ones.In many ways it plays out in the same way as do the line puzzles in The Witness. But, in all honesty, drawing the correct railway track solution in Cosmic Express is far more challenging.The puzzles are very logical, and are intended to completed by thinking through each scenario. But it is entirely possible to solve them by guesswork.One of the levels (Ursa Minor 8, for future reference) I solved accidentally. I genuinely thought I’d figured out the correct solution after MUCH thought. I drew the correct path but for entirely the wrong reasons i.e. the situation I had planned in my head played out rather differently from how the game actually worked.PROS+ Sleek and beautiful presentation.+ No hand-holding.+ A real challenge for dedicated puzzle fanatics.+ Charming sound effects to accompany the child-like art style.+ Branching progression after most levels so if one has you completely stumped you can always go and try another one.CONS- Starts easy, but becomes very difficult extremely quickly.- No hand-holding.- Could have benefited from a hint system for those who are completely stuck e.g. one that suggests which passenger(s) you need to pick up first.- A lot of people will resort to trial and error (rather than just sitting back and thinking), or even brute-forcing the solutions by just randomly drawing track lines. This assumes that they haven’t just rage quit in the meantime.- A minor gripe, but after a while the ambient music started to become irritating. Luckily, there are separate music and sound control sliders.OVERALL: an excellent line puzzle game but only for those who want a serious challenge. Do not buy if you want a casual mobile port – you will be deeply frustrated."

,Recommended,583270,35381308,Posted: 1 October,all,Auroriax,"Cosmic Express might be one of the best puzzle games I've played to date. No puzzle is extraneous, all of the over one-hundred of them each serve a clear purpose. The map allows you to finish the unlocked levels in whichever order you want, making the game very accessible and fair, and levels with multiple exits keep exploring the map exciting.Sokobond was a bit too hard and complex for me. Snowman was great and had a cute aestethic, but is a bit short and easy. Cosmic Express hits the perfect balance, with the track-drawing mechanic being more accessible than block transportation games. So far I've beaten all normal puzzles, but there are still some extra challenges in the endgame, where the difficulty is really ramped up to eleven.The aesthetic is very well done, and while I find the semi-isometric perspective to be a bother at times (you can't draw tracks with straight mouse strokes), it is functional and the little details and easter eggs really top it off. The music is soothing and undistractful.Recommended for fans of the genre, worth looking into for everyone else."
76561198025321433,Not Recommended,583270,31774808,Posted: 15 May,all,American Currency,"Trial & Error - The Game. If you want a brief summary of the pros and cons as well as my personal rating, scroll further down, otherwise read my more in depth reasoning below.--------------------------------------------------I am a huge fan of puzzle games of any kind, and honestly, the first two dozen or so levels of this game are really fun. I like how the game branches out and lets you pick and choose between different ""kinds"" of levels with different mechanics.It is all fun and games for a while, the different puzzle mechanics (basically drawing a path from start to end, picking up passengers and delivering them to the same colored houses, with some twists added in later on) seem natural, intuitive and a lot of the puzzles are difficult but still doable.Sadly, at some point it all falls apart. The bigger and more complicated the levels get, the more you see the biggest flaw of the game - the fact that it eventually all becomes trial and error.It is extremely hard to really ""plan"" a path in advance when you are essentially being crushed under the weight of the many potential solutions a level can have. When I see 12 creatures in the left and boxes strewn everywhere, there is no way to really create an intuitive solution in your head; what ends up happening is that you use trial & error, continoously trying out different paths until you get lucky and get the right one, or give up out of sheer frustration.Even when a level has only few elements, it is still often very hard to plan a path. There is, and that is the biggest flaw of the game, just no way to look at a level and solve it in your head, leading to, as mentioned, Trial & Error being the only solution. And, as Trial & Error will have it, finding a solution in the end is based on luck. And I don't want luck in my puzzle game.This is made even worse by the fact that there is no hint mechanic of any kind in this game. If you can't do a level, well, you are out of luck. There are only incomplete walkthroughs online at the time of writing, even months after the release of the game, only covering the levels that are easy enough to solve alone anyway - seems some of the levels are so frustrating (and not ""fun"" frustrating, as the description states, but just frustrating) that even walkthrough writers just gave up, imagine that.Long story short, at some point you will face an insurmountable barrier. Either you will get lucky and find the right solution to a level quickly, or spend hours and not make any progress due to how unintuitive the level design (and, subsequently, finding the solution) is.That makes the game experience very unsatisfactory and solving later puzzles just isn't rewarding, since you either solve them only by sheer luck or succumb to frustration, but in either event, your skill doesn't matter, only luck does. It just isn't a fun puzzle experience beyond the first two dozen levels or so, which show a promise of the game that could've been.----------------------------------------------------Rating--Pro:- very cute artstyle- very minimal music and sound effects, but it works well- easy to understand gameplay...Cons:- ...that sadly falls apart after a while due to unnecessarily unintuitive design- many levels have no clear solution or even a way of thinking up one, leading to frustration and, due to that, no satisfaction even after beating a level since your skill in puzzle solving didn't matter much- no hint system of any form that could give you at least a tip after being stuck for hours--------------------------------------------------In summary you can say that, while the game is really fun at first, it quickly falls apart the more complicated the mechanics become and, even more so, when these mechanics start to intersect.The game isn't difficult because of the puzzles, but because of the basic design; it is simply unintuitive in the way the puzzles are solved. Even as a huge puzzle fan, I had to quit out of frustration after almost 17 hours of playtime, and I will have to sadly leave the game forever incomplete in my library, else face immense frustration and no satisfaction after brute forcing my way through a level (maybe, eventually. If I am lucky). This is not how puzzle games are supposed to be.Personal Rating: 4/10 (Below Average)"
76561198004565829,Recommended,583270,30676622,Posted: 22 March,all,Victory Adjacent | Mr. Bubbles,"This is a very nice puzzle game with very good puzzles.The main mechanic is simple. You need to build train tracks to ferry strange alien creatures to their homes. And, like most good puzzlers, it uses these simple rules to generate interesting puzzles. As you go further into the game, you unlock new mechanics which change how you thought about the old mechanics, as most puzzle games do. Although there's also an option to unlock all of the puzzles from the get go.What makes the game good is the quality of its puzzles. A lot of them will present you with something that makes you say, ""oh, this looks easy, I'll just do this"", but then it's 15 minutes later and you haven't solved the puzzle. A lot of the time I felt like I was close to an answer, even if it was far away, which made me feel smart when I finally got the puzzle.There's one thing about the input I find annoying. You can't fill in tracks between any two squares you like. As a result, some times while playing I'll want to fill in what I know is partial progress, but I can't.Overall it's a great puzzle game that I've really been enjoying, almost savoring. It's rare to find this good of a puzzle game."

,Recommended,583270,31495334,Posted: 1 May,all,Worker,"You solve puzzles in Cosmic Express by discovering what you can and can't do on a grid and ""debugging"" solutions as you lay track. This is sort of similar to something like Jelly No Puzzle or Snakebird, but in Cosmic Express, what you need to do to solve a puzzle isn't immediately apparent... You have to discover why certain solutions won't work. This is great but can lead to spats of frustration if you're totally clueless about what to do. Solving puzzles, however, is always satisfying.These are puzzles with multiple solutions, combining spatial reasoning with order of execution logic as you negotiate which aliens to pick up first. The difficulty curve is really sweet... I went from solving 10 puzzles per session to 1 or 2 at a time in the late game."

The rules are simple and intuitive, but the author manages to create some devilishly hard puzzles with them.One way this game could be improved is with a little smoother gradation in level difficulty. It goes from solutions that are extremely obvious to ""head scratcher"" level with very little learning curve between. That's a minor problem, though."
,Recommended,583270,35031299,Posted: 17 September,all,Trick Question,"Cosmic Express is a casual puzzle game of moderately challenging difficulty. It features 128 levels, challenge versions for ten of the levels, and several postmastery challenges.There are three features which set the boards (multiple aliens, board shapes, and number of cars), and the game ends up adding six more features as you progress through the levels. Unfortunately, there isn't enough variation to support 128 different levels. This makes some of the less-challenging levels in the mid-game feel like a slog.A second missed opportunity is the lack of economy challenges. This is a ""geometric ordering"" puzzle game, but there are no marks for different kinds of optimal solutions.Despite the minor flaws, the game is well-polished and I recommend it to other casual puzzle enthusiasts."
