I would rather play Slash It then zup or pain train or super duper genocide bs as the gameplay and music makes me want to keep playing, although doing the same thing over again to get those last few achievements can be tedious but I feel like it was worth it imo. So ye Slash It is the way to go if you want to carry on doing games with lots of easy achievements (imo ofc)."

,Recommended,583760,30655270,Posted: 21 March,all,GeoLuz 🎮💯👊🤙,"Slash It 2 is the sequel to Slash It. It is the same as Slash It in that there are multiple modes to play and you must type letters and/or numbers to score points. This game has 6 modes, but the Classic mode from the original Slash It game is gone. However, I think Slash It 2 does well without the Classic mode in which you must match different shapes. By dedicating itself to strictly matching numbers and letters, I think Slash It 2 is better than Slash It.The game encourages you to hone your typing skills on the keyboard. The mode gets progressively faster as you correctly type the number or letter on the screen. A great addition to Slash It 2 is the Words mode. The Words mode is better than the Classic mode on Slash It. Words travel across the screen from right to left and the objective is to type the words correctly to score points. Eventually, more words will flow across the screen, causing the mode to be more challenging that at the beginning. The Words mode fits more into the Slash It franchise’s purpose of helping you improve your typing skills than the Classic mode from the original Slash It.The soundtrack of Slash It 2 is outstanding. The music plays from the start of your playthrough and the screen flashes as you type numbers, letters, words, or a combination of numbers and letters. Thus, the music truly adds to the entertainment value of the game. You can buy the Slash It 2 – Electronic Music Pack for $0.99 to add to the already entertaining classic music that comes with the game.I recommend Slash It 2 to anyone with and desire to improve their typing skills and for the entertainment that comes with type letters, numbers, and words. I firmly believe that it you liked Slash It, you will love Slash It 2. Kudos to Just1337 Studio for making a sequel that improves on the original."

The first “Slash It” really hit me by surprise when it came out. Slash It 2 really improved itself compared to the first one, especially on the visual note. The new effects are looking great and are beautifully made. The sound is also good and is matching the action on the Screen. You also have the option to turn the effects completely off, if you find them distracting.Like in “Slash It”, “Slash It 2” offers 6 game modes with increasingly difficulty.For the little price the game costs you can’t make much wrong here, especially if you already liked the first game.Also, if you are an Achievement Hunter, the game will make you happy again, since it offers 302 Achievements you can accomplish."

76561198047672025,Recommended,583760,29702012,Posted: 4 February,all,Conker,"They added words to the typing rhythm games you have to play to unlock the achievements, which was the only one i liked. I found using a wireless keyboard with flat keys is 10 times harder than a traditional keyboard. I wish there was a setting to slow down how fast the numbers and letters showed up on the random letter and number games, it woulda been ok for me if it was a bit slower.It was also hard to sometimes see what words you had to type with all the flashing colours and and the letters being in small circles around them.I don't think this would help that much if you wanted to use it to get better at typing, using the words mini game one it might help, but the other ones arer just a pain. If you use a smaller keyboard, even if you know where the keys usually are, because it's smaller it is really hard to hit the right keys, i'd only recommend this if your keyboard is a decent size and you can already touch type.The music is better in this one though than the first one."

In Slash It 2 they also added a different mode called Word mode where you type words. Although they did get rid of the shape mode (which I personally found was very entertaining). The game also has an electronic mode, where the music changes and the visuals also change.

,Recommended,583760,31192590,Posted: 16 April,all,Shrodu,"Coat it in fancy paint and you won't tell the difference.From the maker ofSlash Itcomes a sequel/remake of the exact same game, only cutting out its original classic mode where you match the line-shapes to the outline shapes and replacing it with better graphics, audio, and a ""words"" mode.  The aesthetic is much better this time around, but it's essentially the exact same game.In case you skipped out onSlash It, it (along withSlash It 2) are just games about pressing the buttons on the screen in the order that they appear, failure to do so means you have less time to continue until you are eliminated and the current ""match"" shuts down.  The modes inSlash It 2include Numbers, Alphabet, Words (New mode where you have to complete letters of words that appear on the screen), Twisted Numbers (they spin and move around), Twisted Alphabet (they spin and move around), and Crazy (which is the mode where it alternates between numbers and letters).Overall, it's the same as the first game, just with a missing mode and more pleasant on the eyes and ears.  If you want achievements to rain down or want something that's just a pinch better than the first installment, jump right in.  But just like the first game, the replayability is low after you complete its achievements.Slash It 2is currently on store for $1, but buying it on sale (50% off) will be more worth your money, especially since you get trading card drops.  Avoid only if you're tired of games where achievements rain down on you for just about everything you do.6.2/10  Secondversegame, same as the first!"

I cant deny - my WPM(words per minute) has greatly increased after playing this game. Also - one of the best soundtracks  in a game in a long time. Thanks, developers. :)"
,Recommended,583760,30262400,Posted: 1 March,all,Do-Sho,"If you want a great game to practice typing this is it... This game is fast paced with great music and will push your typing speed to its peak. The game offers many great play styles with DLC available to add new languages as well. Have yet to try the DLC, not sure if I'll bother with Chinese though since I do not have a Chinese keyboard, but German does sound interesting as typing in another language should force me to really focus on what I am typing. Best typing game I have played yet."

The achievements looks cool and makes sense, but over 150 achievements in a game is achievement spam. (Im not saying those big games that takes a lot of time to beat use achievement spam, but for games you can complete in under 2 hours and uses that amount of achievements, spams.)Indie. Some people love indie games, some people hate them.CONS:-In my opinion the numbers got a bit downgraded. The first Slash it had numbers that popped out of nowhere, but in the sequel, you just follow a plane lane. Some may like it, but I don't.CONCLUSION:Cool project. Defenitly a masterpiece compared to the first one. And I'm kind of hyped for the possible sequel to this one.FOR AN INDIE GAME: 7/10"

Basically an aesthetic typing game with some music and when you type if the first letter of another word is the same as the one you are typing it hits all of those at the same time, like if you have the words scope score and are to type, if you type scope then are, score will have been typed off as well.The first two modes are harder than the word one as well imo."
,Recommended,583760,32187360,Posted: 4 June,all,The9thBit,"Slash It 2 is an extremely simple game -- characters that corrospond to buttons on your keyboard appear onscreen, and you have to push them without waiting too long. Meanwhile, music plays in the background and psychedelic effects appear.The whole game only has a handful of songs in it, and there's no way to add more. The gameplay is repetitive and not fun for more than 20 or 30 minutes at a time. However, given that it's a $0.99 game, I can't really complain. For the sale price of $0.49 (what I bought it at), I'd actually call it a bargain.Do you enjoy typing fast? Do you have some leftover money in your Steam wallet? Are you bored and looking for someting to keep you occupied for an evening? If you answered ""Yes"" to all of these questions, then you should buy this game."
