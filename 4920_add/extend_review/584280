I am refunding it, despite what their silly eula may claim and leaving a warning to avoid this garbage."

No sense of running an airline or airport. The engine sound from the prop plane is just as loud when you are up close as when you are far away.When the game starts you can set some settings, then another screen shows new game-continue- settings >> this setting screen does not work. Later in-game when you hit escape another menu pops up that shows another settings and THIS one works. You can change sound etc.Controls feel clunky. You can ""walk"" around the terminal, but like everything else, everything is already built.Right now, there is no sense of management or tycoon level game. You just sit around watching an airport.Everything looks dark even when it is 10am in daylight. There's a taxi next to the control tower not sure why.The airport doesn't look connected to any roadways.I get this is Early Access, but so early it's not worth $15. Maybe, maybe $5.Super dissapointed."

It really makes Airline Tycoon look like a complex masterpiece of game design and it offers absolutly no justification for its price tag.To make things even worse, the developers try to restrict basic consumer rights with an extremly overreaching (and therefore invalid) EULA, in which they even try to prohibit Steam refunds. To top things off, they try to prevent criticism with dubious copyright claims on Youtube.I will enjoy my refund for this one."

Game released far to early, even for a pre alpha, i can live with items not being in game, thats part of the Alpha stage. but the flight school aircraft have failed to return to the airfield and makes the game unplayable. (this should have been picked up with minimal testing!!!)2. This isnt a managment game as such is very much a point a click, aircraft lands - click and AI takes care of it, i felt like i just order stuff to do stuff with 1 click.3. No way to increase time and with buggy planes not coming home you just sit and wait then click once every 20-30 minutesi really dislike giving a game a Thumbs Down, but at this stage wait for a few patches and fixes before purchaseRegardsTMTC1"

,Not Recommended,584280,30359753,Posted: 6 March,all,Sexy Super Slut,"Before you consider buying this, have a look at this gameplay video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJUO-wpLuUNow let's cut to the chase. In my personal opinion, this game is boring as hell. It is also my personal opinion that it is a ripoff at its current price, namely that I have to pay money for it at all.Oh, and that gameplay video? Here is a video of the same person, who got in an ""argument"" with the developer:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B05hXRDm03I&t=602sHere is a video of a copyright attorney and his professional opinion in the matter:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3OnXjnIGA0Thank God for Jim ♥♥♥♥ing Sterling Son!Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to refund this game. And no, they can't stop you from getting refunds as long as Steam offers them, no matter what they put in the EULA, under section 9.Have a nice day :)Oh, and STiCLi, some genuine advice for you: Don't go down this route. You will not survive the negative publicity that comes from this. Believe me. You already have a terrible reputation at this point and it will only get worse. You will not win this. Research Digital Homicide and their dealings with Jim Sterling. I'll tell you exactly what is going to happen if you continue to fight this. The more you try to silence criticism (and I'm not saying you are trying to silence criticism), the worse your reputation will get. It's EXACTLY what happened to Digital Homicide and they're banned from Steam and financially ♥♥♥♥ed. And that is because they couldn't deal with criticism. It's not too late! You can still turn this around. That's one option. You can just walk away from this and potentially save your reputation. You can listen to the criticism, no matter how harsh it is, and think of a way to improve your games. And of course not every bit of criticism is fair. But if you listen to it, you might make the best game you'll ever make. Another option is to keep fighting. But know this. If you choose the latter, you will destroy your reputation. And what happens when you have a bad reputation on Steam? People will hate you and refuse to buy your games. If you do choose the latter, that's completely fine. It's your choice. But if you do, remember the advice I gave you and imagine me saying ""I ♥♥♥♥ing told you so"" when it's too late to walk back.I hope you choose the former and I hope you will listen to other people's criticism and make the best game you can make. If you choose the latter, it would be a shame, but also entertaining to watch.Here is a video just for you. It explains exactly what happened when Jim Sterling criticized a game by Scott Cawthon. What followed was a lot of introspection and eventually, Five Nights at Freddy's. This is a developer who, at no point, tried to silence a critic:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsOLvDzaFYYEDIT: I screwed up the last link. Whoops!"

I know it's an alpha, but in its current state it's unplayable and complete trash. I don't really see any potential here either, as these devs clearly have no idea what they're doing. Nothing inherently wrong with that, but this ""game"" is another clear example of why Steam Greenlight is being killed.I'll be refunding this immediately."
,Not Recommended,584280,30369677,Posted: 7 March,all,MartyPG13,"Unfortunately the game was broken at the EULA stage which has an incredibly abusive rights grabs within it, even going so far to claim it was against STICLI's rights for me to claim a refund on the game.Beyond that it has one of the worst menu systems I've ever seen in a title. This game is in a very unfinished state even for an early access title, it's spartan, has terrible textures and a questionable framerate, although it does have a help screen. As such, it's impossible to recommend.I've claimed a Steam refund on the game because of the EULA overreach and the awful menu system."

I know it's Early Access, but it should at least be able to run few minutest without crashes and freezes.Also, first person controls are so poor, that it's impossible to move around in first person view....So, no mater how interesting idea of this game sounds, avoid it at all cost until it's at some more playable version... if that ever happen."
,Not Recommended,584280,30492039,Posted: 13 March,all,[FP] OblivionCreator,"Alright.I tried to give this game a chance, seeing if it could have ANY chance of being a decent game in the future, bad developers or not.Downsides:I played the game for an hour and a half on twitch.tv and managed to get 4 planes to take off and one to land. Each plane only ever needed one button press to get the plane going, which meant that all I needed to do was click once every 23 minutes (I didn't need to click anything for the plane that landed). As the start of the game, you get information overload, which is pointless, considering that all you need to do is click on the icon ontop of a plane and it does all the work by itself.The 'Flight School' planes, which from what I could tell are supposed to fly back after a while, both flew in a straight line before half an hour later going through the skybox and continuing off into the abyss, which was funny for a while but soon grew old. The terrain looks like something taken out of Google Maps but then rescaled into a 480p image whilst simultaneously being stretched over several miles.The ingame camera is garbage. It's very loose and glides around a lot, but the way the camera moves changes between different camera views meaning you can never quite get used to one method of moving it.90% of the features the game CLAIMS to have are actually 'To Be Added' when you attempt to use them - Which would be fine if it wasn't a $15 game, early access or not.Everything just makes random noises. Seriously. There was a propellor plane that made jet engine noises, in the middle of the airport there was something that sounded like a mix between a highway and the ocean, the ATC tower had annoying clicking noises in, despite nobody actually being in ATC.There's nothing to see. Once you've seen one plane takeoff or land, you've seen them all. The various vehicles that drive to and from the planes don't even have drivers, the bus has no passengers and the entire airport is empty of life.Again, the textures are pure garbage. Most of them are low resolution, one of them is reused several times and looks out of place in all of its uses (The skid marks on the runway are neither realistic or high quality, they look like someone made them in MS Paint). There are several vending machines with ""Doritoes"" and ""Lays"" chips inside of them, barely visible through the *** textures. I highly doubt Doritoes or Lays would want their product in this game (Ironically, this is closer to Trademark infringement that the devs have on Jim Sterling).Upsides:The Refund button still worksUnity has built in 21:9 supportOverall score: ♥♥♥♥ING NOTHING / 10"

Such as there is a ""game"" it's nothing beyond monitoring and managing streams of horrendously laid out and coloured text. Graphically this would look out of place on a PS1, control-wise it's like controling a drunk person (in a non-amusing way that makes you feel ill). Gameplay-wise there is basically nothing there, much is ""yet to be added"" and ""coming soon"". The EULA you agree to is, at best, hilariously over-reaching and amounts to nothing beyond an attempt to silence critics and YouTubers (I made a video regardless, people need to know why to avoid this garbage from a garbage ""company"".

All I got to do was purchase fuel and change prices in the cafeteria etc. I wish I spent my money on something else. I spent 27 minutes ""playing"" this game, and nothing ever happened except that I could see from my finances that I sold snacks to passengers which I never saw anything of. Watching the terminal inside is so unecessary when it's premade and nothing happens! I never found out if I could speed up the game. The clock counts seconds in real-time. My first flight was departing at 9:35, and the time was 8:40. I could just not stay an hour watching just to see it depart. I respect that making games takes hours and hours, but this is just too narrow with uninteresting extras. Who want's to purchase fuel and run a power plant if you're interested in just managing a busy airport (which you made busy by playing)? The time everything takes reminds me of free iPhone games. I would recommend Airport Inc./Tycoon 1. It get's god gamn annoying after a couple of hours playing but it's entertaining for the first two hours at least."
