Just fits the gamestyle better IMHO. But that should not deter anyone from buying. Objectively, I believe the gameplay changes are making it a better game, so if you haven't tried the mobile version or feel like starting it all over, but a little better, than this is the game for you."

76561198050433002,Recommended,584370,34407943,Posted: 21 August,all,rcjenn40,"I would classify this as a walking simulator designed for crafting game fans.It has light skill-based RPG elements, using upgradeable skill trees to build everything from your stats (Tailoring) to occupation, and everything in between. Heck there's even upgradeable skills to allow stacking of resources.Basically you're walking long trails that are broken up in camp locations through various environments gathering resources to craft with.Each camp offers a quest to complete before reaching the next camp in order to earn skill points to apply to the character building skill trees.You gather resources, hunt animals, chop trees along the trail to craft items to sell in the next camp or equip on your character. Items degrade pretty rapidly, so you're always replacing clothing and gear, while also gathering/crafting in order to sell items at the next camp.There's also a large town to live in and well as player created towns that a player can live in, build a house and run a business out of.The play style is very relaxed. Every camp being a save point, with walking from camp to camp or town only taking a few minutes, so it's very relaxed and casual.It can be kind of grindy since items do degrade pretty fast and you may have fast travel back to a previous area in order to gather certain resources to craft with.All in all, if you're a fan of relaxed, casual crafting games and like to have a wide variety of how they're played, this walking/crafting game would probably be something you'd want for your collection.If you're easily bored of repetitive actions or need a lot of action and eye candy then I'd definitely watch a few Let's Plays to judge your interest in this.Personally I'm enjoying the heck out of it."

,Not Recommended,584370,35053194,Posted: 18 September,all,Kit,"I did enjoy this game, got through to Eden falls and made a house which I took up a couple of levels.  It was fun casual gaming, and I am looking for some relaxed easy games to play late in the evening to switch off. The problem is after playing a couple of games I just haven't returned to the game (and looking at time spent by reviewers it seems half of the people that enjoyed the game have had similar experience).The equipment you make wears down and then breaks. So no matter how far you progress you seem to be running in order to stand still. Your clothes wear and break over time, your axes break from use... So you'll need to play the game well in order to keep a decent set of equipment. But I don't want that pressure - I was hoping for a more relaxing style of game (which the initial levels were).Perhaps the developers could consider some sort of 'easy' mode for the very casual gamers among us who don't want to be racing against breaking clothes all the time."
,Recommended,584370,34341162,Posted: 18 August,all,Vana,"If you're looking for a solid, polished game with a huge variety of game mechanics, this is it. It's simplistic and repetitive enough to allow you to slowly master each aspect of the game, but it mixes things up and surprises you just often enough to remain interesting and exciting. A fantastic game with beautiful artistic scenery.The game takes 30 to 40 minutes to really kick off, but even after that it ramps up further once you reach Eden Falls. Seriously great game, and for those of you who played the mobile version, the base game and opening are the same, that is it. From there the game takes a very different path, faster progression, a full-fledged skill system and mechanic changes such as sprinting.This version also has ABSOLUTELY NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS like the mobile one does, and that isn't as small as a change as simply removing the cash currency; ""favours"". The removeal of microtransactions bleeds throughout all the game's mechanics, it's is no longer designed in any way to try and take more money off you, even though The Trail's mobile version didn't have particularly bad microtransactions compared to other mobile games.If you've got time and enjoy something a little different, give this a shot, you won't regret it."

,Recommended,584370,34328169,Posted: 18 August,all,charlesberg,"Couple of bugs, here and there but overral - a decent mobile port.You literally walk, jog, run along a set path while picking up items along the way for you to craft items to either use for yourself or sell on in trading rounds at each campsite.Food is my main concern as it's super easy to come by but also really difficult to maintain a decent amount of food to use.You earn chits by crafting items and selling them or selling on raw materials.You can earn skill points by completing challenges, usually one at every campsite which lead to you being able to craft much higher quality items which again come in handy when you're selling items.Overral though, I'd recommend as it's fun to keep coming back to every now and then."
,Recommended,584370,34311732,Posted: 17 August,all,Bitcherina,"No bugs I've encountered, no microtransactions (that is only on mobile version, not this steam-version). Super fun game that I've already stayed up too late playing.My  only complaint is how tools behave. If you have 3 axes in your inventory, it will always use the highest-durability axe to chop a tree no matter where you place axes in your inventory (ex 2 on hooks, 1 in bag in any order I've tried them all). REALLY hope they fix this as I make multiple hatchets to sell. Lost durability is lost money."

I came into this without knowing that it was a mobile game at first, and honestly I couldn't even tell that it once was! Feels very fluid and well made on the PC for sure!Aside from the beautiful graphics, fun music and engaging gameplay, I'm finding this game to be VERY challenging. I'm probably just bad lol, but man this game is hard!Anyways, if yall want to see my first 30 minutes or so of this game, heres a video to check it out!:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v8saanq4lg"

(which ultimatly will fall on deaf ears)The game itself is apparently an adaptation of a mobile game. Like most mobile games these days it was version of pay to play/fremium. The game itself is quite neat and has a simplistic artstyle. It is an inventory management game with crafting. The background music is soothing but won't win any awards. All in all i like the game. It won't get you adrenaline pumping but it will offer some fun.I can recommend it to a younger audience.As for the Developer 22cans:Oh boy oh boy oh boy... The Studio started out as a kickstarter project as Godus was initialized. As a matter of fact, take a look at that game. It recieved an astonishing amount of bad reviews for the fact that the developers basically called quits on the development. It is a bad buisness parctice and i think the are liable and should be held accountable for their mistakes, through legal (!) means.(the next part should please be overlooked by an underage audience because i am going to swear a lot)My Rant: Oh for ♥♥♥♥s sake are you kidding me? I, as the blind customer, didn't know the previous part. And I think it is hightime that people do something concret against malpractices and all around circlejerks. Ubisoft: ♥♥♥♥ you! You guys ♥♥♥♥ed up heroes of might and magic 6 and 7 up royaly. 2k and Firaxis: likewise, for those that don't know, take a look at the reviews for their dlcs. The offered a completed edition with a number of yet to be released dlcs and priced the last one higher so that they made the complete edition barely cheaper. Needless to say, the fans are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Kalypso Media: How do you manage to screw up a game so bad (patricians 4) that it is even worse than its predecessor. And last but not least Snowbird studio: ... Imperium got me good... Why the ♥♥♥♥ do we let something like this happen, or even better yet, why do you? Why are you so bad at TQM?"

I would also like if there was more variety in the characters you choose at the begining. Other than those small problems, it was really good and I would highly recommend it to another person."
,Recommended,584370,34556703,Posted: 28 August,all,VonKlutch,"Great game, strangely addicting, and very fun. A little more complicated than the IOS version but in a good way. I hope to see more content added, cause this one could stick around."
76561198057875575,Recommended,584370,34779547,Posted: 6 September,all,ph.winzer,"Well, I would recomend this game but I think some things could have a bit of an improvement:- The constant need to change everything you have is reeaaaaalllllyyy tedious if there was a way to get undestructible clothes like in the mobile version (could be found at the flying shop at a high Chits price or from challenges) that would really ease the burden.Also it seems there are some of the clothes that are not available in the game"

,Recommended,584370,34770536,Posted: 5 September,all,Topsy,"Not really worth the full $15 dollar price tag, but buy it 100% if it's on sale. If you came from the mobile game, there is quite a ways worth more of content."

76561197993172532,Recommended,584370,34477418,Posted: 25 August,all,Butthurt Joe™,Games quite good but not the one for me. I refunded but maybe will buy on when its on sale since the price tag doesnt fir for me personally. I give it a thumbs up anyway for removing p2w content by making a single price.

76561198020372332,Recommended,584370,35166335,Posted: 23 September,all,Clara?!,"This game is excelent to let some steam off and makes for a great casual play. Since I'm a veteran at it, I'm further ahead than I should be, since alot of my skills have not been developed enough to craft or gather good recourses.Pros:Fun and challengingRelaxingRewardingCons:May require heavy grinding if you are inexpirienced with the gameIf you have a dead town you won't be able to craft important items (like gold bars or silver bars)Changing town is too expensiveThe game doesnt give you th possibility to found your own town directly when you hit eden fallsThe game requires patience, but it's absolutely worth plaiyng it. Not sure if you want to pay 15 bucks though, wait for Steam Sale and get it then."
